If you run your knobbies at typical MTB pressures, and you run your slicks at higher pressures, you should experience less rolling resistance, which could translate to higher speed. I don't know what tires you're talking about exactly, so it's hard to say how much of a difference it will make. I run some pretty aggressive knobbies on my MTB (Panaracer Fire XC Pros) and with <35 PSI in them, that makes for some noticeable rolling resistance. On my vintage no-suspension MTB, I run slicks with 60-65 PSI in them, and those are halfway to being road-bike-like. Even with the MTB gearing, I can hold 15-16 mph on that bike for a decent amount of time. You did not indicate what kind of suspension your MTB has. With any suspension, you're probably going to get a little pedal bob, which will rob you of some energy. That, combined with the upright riding position, will hold you back a little. But the engine (your strength) is more of a factor than tires, suspension, and bike weight. Once upon a time a friend of mine-- road bike rider, likes Italian bikes, pretty fit at the time-- used to regularly get passed on a local muni trail by this little guy on a vintage mountain bike who was dressed in street clothes and riding to/from work. These roadies would be doing a paceline at a good speed, and the little guy on the mountain bike would just roll right past them, comfortably holding 2-3 mph faster. I wasn't there, so I can't tell you if the mountain bike guy had modified his bike or what. But he used to say "good morning" or something similar, every time he passed them, with a big smile. 

Personally, considering the cost of a replacement crank and/or chainwheel, I'd probably take the bicycle to a trusted local bike store and pay them to fix my mistake. If you make it worse, that's false economy. You could slot it with a Dremel, but before I did that I'd try a Torx bit first. Sometimes it is possible to force a Torx bit into a stripped Allen/hex-headed screw, and if the bit is short enough you might be able to force it in using a clamp of appropriate size. Unless you protect the area around the bolt and have some solid Dremel skilz, I'd say the chance of marring the chainwheel and/or crank is pretty high if you go the Dremel route. Heating the bolt with a butane torch lighter or propane torch could help, but I would not put the whole crank into the oven. You might try penetrating oil, followed by some heat, followed by some more penetrating oil, etc. Be careful not to overdo it; I would start slowly, and go slowly. I should note, I'm not a metallurgist, but I would think that too much heat is as bad as not enough. Too, I've never tried this, but it might give you some ideas. 

You might want to play around with Bike Calculator a little, and you could find a reasonable estimate for your question. Regarding the new bike purchase, shop around carefully. You're already past what is considered the clearance season for 2012 models at many traditional brick-and-mortar bicycle retailers. Prime time is August/September of each year. That's when many retailers start their clearance sales. 

You may want to consider this forum for some encouragement and support. There are many inspiring stories that people there have shared. If you ride faithfully-- three or four times per week-- you will find that your ability will increase rapidly for a time. In my own case, when I first started to ride, I found just going a few miles was quite a workout. But within about four months, I went from riding around 5 miles at once to riding 20-25 miles at once, at a reasonable speed. In order to do that, I was riding about 3-4 times per week, and gradually increasing the distance and difficulty. Once I was able to ride 20-25 miles at once, I joined a cycling group at my church, and that was very, very good. Riding with a group helps keep me accountable. When I miss a ride, people ask me why I was absent. It helps me not to be lazy. So I would also encourage you, once you have achieved a little bit of stamina, to look for a group you can ride with. You want the riders in the group to be reasonably close to your ability, or it will not be good. Final thought: regarding your bicycle, it is probably a good choice. The riding position will be more comfortable for someone who is overweight (I know from experience). Generally I would say offroad riding is harder than on-road or bike trail/MUP riding, so you may want to consider where you ride. I only attempted offroad riding after I was a seasoned road/MUP rider. Of course, everyone is different, so YMMV. However I think you should consider replacing your knobby tires with road tires if you not riding dirt. Knobbies can add a lot of rolling resistance. 

A picture would probably be very helpful. In particular, a close-up picture of the rim around the valve hole, with the tire installed and at least partially inflated. I agree with the diagnosis of a Presta valve being used without a grommet in a rim drilled for a Schrader valve. But it may be possible that more than one thing is causing your flats. When you install a new tube in a tire, the rubber holding the valve to the tube can get caught under the bead, and this can cause a flat. The remedy is to push the valve into the tire when you install it. What I mean is, push on the valve stem, like you see in the first 15-20 seconds of this video. Too, sometimes the adhesive on rim tape is not good, due to age, oxidation, or the rim tape itself is poor quality (like the tape sold by a large national chain of bicycle stores). The tape can move around during the installation of a new tube, exposing spoke holes and/or valve holes. This can cause a flat. The best solution is to either use good rim tape, of the proper width for your rim, or, even better, to use a rim strip. 

I'm not sure what you're comparing the effort to, but typically the front derailleur requires more cable pull to actuate, in comparison to shifting in the rear. Adjusting Shimano Front Derailleurs 

Speedplay advises the use of dry silicone lubricants, but I found the expensive one I tried to be ineffective. The first time I tried the pedals I was quite surprised at the amount of force necessary to unclip, but I'm certain this was partially caused by the ineffective spray-on silicone lube. At this point I have used Pedro's Ice Wax, and it works well, as would any similar wax lube for your chain. However it also leaves quite a bit of build-up after a time, and necessitates some cleaning. Speedplay also advises that the pedals should be relubricated with grease from time to time. I bought some grease and a grease gun which I use for this purpose. A collateral benefit is that this grease also works pretty well for lubing the Speedplay cleats. The screws on the cleats will work loose over time, and sometimes you need to disassemble the cleat in order to tighten everything completely. I usually take that opportunity to put a little grease in the C- or U-shaped channel where the spring clip sits. A little of it oozes out and helps with clipping in and clipping out. You need to be a little careful when wearing these cleats-- for example, I'm down at the beach quite a bit with my road bike but I never walk on the sand-- as any lubricant you use can attract dirt, which can make it harder to clip in. But one accessory that every Speedplay user should have is these covers, which are pretty effective at keeping the cleats up and out of debris on the ground that might stick to lubricant. As you use your pedals you will find they wear a bit, and this also helps with the clipping in and out. 

In my experience, things happen so fast it is practically impossible to react with some kind of plan. I have fallen over when I couldn't unclip fast enough (in other words, when the bike was stopped at a light or similar), and those were the only times where I knew I was falling and could actually spend a fraction of a second looking for something to grab, or trying to figure out how to land. All the other times-- in other words, when my bike was moving-- it happened so fast that it seemed I was on the ground looking up before I could really do something intensional. I suppose if you live on the bike, you may become skilled enough to where you can recover from some crashes (see Peter Sagan right around 4:50 in this video for an example), but even if you're very skilled, there isn't much you can do in many circumstances, except perhaps try to learn from them so you don't repeat mistakes. I'll give you an example. A few weeks ago I was riding behind a friend-- a skilled rider, many years of experience-- and in a bike tunnel which goes under a road, there was some sand in our lane. He did not see the sand, and when his bike went over it, his hands were jarred from the bars, and he went down, right in front of me. It was all I could do to slow down and try to avoid hitting him and his bike. What did he do right? He wore his helmet. What did he do wrong? His grip on the bars was too loose. Hopefully he will relearn that lesson (I'm sure he knew it already). All it takes is a moment of inattention. But what could he do? He was on the ground in a fraction of a second. BTW, you might be well-advised to carry some basic first-aid stuff. Something to clean patches of road-rash, and that kind of thing. Riding in an urban environment, you probably don't need an extensive kit like mountain bikers often carry, but you might get a good idea of what you might want to select from looking at such kits.
