Yes you can probably quit without notice without repercussions, but why not give notice anyway? They will not ask you to serve your notice unless they are desperate to fill a shift - they would rather give them to those who are staying. 

An important thing to know is why he is commenting in English. Is it because his superiors or client in another office only speak English? I worked from Spain on an offer/study for oil project in Latin America. The end user, a large multinational based in France, hired a Latin American company to filter the offers from ourselves and our competitors. Most of the documentation was in Spanish, but there was set of comments done on the highest level technical documents (regarding the process design) which were done by the Latin American intermediary in English. We justified the way we had done things (In English, as was required!) but to save face (not appear stupid), the Latin American intermediary edited our responses to some of their dumber comments before sending them to the French end user. As a result the end user complained that the responses did not make sense, which made everyone look bad. This is a somewhat unfortunate example, but it illustrates the politics of the situation. If there is someone who does not speak the local language behind the scenes, you have to decide whether it is best to reply in English to impress them (bearing in mind your replies may be filtered) or reply in the local language to build a relationship with your immediate contact. As others have said, ask what the situation is! Also, do not assume based on a name. Occasionally I write a brief internal email in Spanish based on a name, and then have to apologize when I find out the recipient is Filipino (there are quite a lot of Filipinos working in my industry in Spain, and despite their Spanish surnames, most prefer to speak English.) For external communication or longer emails I find out the preferred language first. 

Two possibilities. If you're an employee, figuring out a way to do your work 10 times faster is your problem. Your employer has hired you for a task in exchange for a salary. If the task is done, you deserve the salary. End of story. Why? Because the crazy amount of studies you put yourself into, and which today allows you to be that performant, doesn't belong to your employer. It belongs to you. So if your employer wants you to get more done, he has to pay more. Automation is not work you did today, it's work you did years before and which enables you to be over-performing today. If you're an associate, then the company's interests are aligned with your interests. Then you should act accordingly. The fact that your employer gives you a salary and no capital in exchange for your work proves that your interests are not aligned with the company's interests. If your employer is not happy with that, he can either: 

The problem is: company B who already made me an offer wants me to act fast and resign from my current position before end of Decembre. Company C has my second interview scheduled for mid January with no way to do that earlier (I already asked). What options do I have? What is the best strategy to achieve the goals I described above? Both positions B and C are equally interesting for me. Keeping my current position (A) is not my preferable solution except they make a far better offer than B and C (note that I dont even know conditions of C) which I honestly do not expect, especially since offer B is already very good and I expect offer C to be at least equally to B or even better. 

French guy here. A few years ago, I've been in the exact same situation you describe, and I made the mistake of signing. The problem you'll find if you sign is not necessarily that you won't get part of your pay sooner or later. That contingency would at least prove manageable in some way. No, the real problem here is that by offering this proposal to you, they do nothing but prove a serious and irretrievable lack of culture about what is a software developer and how he works. They pretend to be a startup, but they do apply fundamentally "agency-like" reasonings. They even confessed not being capable of managing and motivating developers (the last one, in their terms, came to "do what he wanted and show only when he pleased"). Knowing nothing about software development, they want to have a trigger to better control you and better pressure you, if only unconsciously, so that you'll be tempted to shut your mouth if problems arise. And if you don't, they'll cut your pay, knowing that it would be an enormous pain in the ass for you to go legal about it (long procedures, nothing to be gained in the end...). Been there, done that. Run from this toxic environment, and find a true "startup". -- Responding to your update Your update makes me think that they felt your hesitation and changed their discourse. Remember their initial idea was of a punishment in case of professional fault. This is what they're really thinking about, even if they changed the wording afterwards. Otherwise, why would they have even mention this possibility in the first place? Additionally, their criterias ("respect of rules, implication, motivation") are all subjective: 

Don´t ask how you did - they won´t be able to answer it unless they have seen all candidates, and it is therefore an unreasonable, pushy and naive thing to ask. Do ask what the next stage is. There may be a second interview or some kind of test before you are hired. You are asking this because you need to know the answer, but it is also an opportunity to look for clues. If the hiring manager can´t be bothered to give you a full answer, you did badly. If he tells you that you will be called back to meet the CEO and / or other managers you did well. If he starts talking about the practicalities of moving for the job (if applicable) you did very well. 

It's also possible that you don't have any room for evolution in this particular company, in which case you should leave. It's also possible that you don't want to do something radically different, you just don't feel like working in that team or on that project or in that company anymore. Perhaps it's the neighbourhood, the color of the walls, perhaps it's something else; anyway your feelings of boredom and guiltiness are telling you that you don't want to keep on those tracks anymore. Do you see yourself stuck in that situation, having to do something that doesn't bring you any fun by now, and does not challenge your intellect anymore to the point that you're just bored to death about it, afraid to talk about your boredom with your boss, until you retire? If not, it might indeed be time to make a change. 

Absolutely no problem here. If you really like to be abroad without changing the (official) place you live, try International Software Consulting or even Sales. In these jobs you will be constantly on the road and live mostly in hotels. If you like to write code, I recommend working as SW Engineer for a company with international facilities, e.g. big manufacturers with facilities in different countries and try to get a position as an Expatriate. Also, there are SW companies who are doing long-term projects for customers all over the world, but I would go for Expatriate if I would like to stay more than a year abroad. 

Firstly, never take any criticism in workplace personally. Just say you understood your mistakes and will learn from them, and nothing more. Obviously, your project manager is not acting professionally by doing things like these. And if the project manager is acting in a negative manner, this negative manner will also be the general attitude of the project team. This is why they say, project managers should have good interpersonal skills. Yours does not have and you and the whole team is suffering because of this. What can you do? Talk with the project manager about your problems in a face-to-face-meeting. Secondly, one hour+ home-workplace-distance is long. Consider moving to nearer to the company if you want to stay there. Also, try to get a position in another department oder team within the company if you really want to stay there. However, as a SE, even a junior one, you should not have any problems finding another job at another company. Start looking for that and finish these last two months of internship, with at least friction as possible. It will rise your chances to find a job at another company or another department. Do not resign, talk with your project manager first. If he does not listen to you, escalate the problem to his/her supervisor. 

To me, it simply looks like you've got bored to death with your job. You already proved you can do what's expected from you now and now it's done you don't have the energy to repeat yourself. The good news is it's a sign of intellectual strength - you're just not a code monkey and you can deliver only when the job represents a challenge to you. So go ahead and talk with your boss, but not about your underperformance. Rather about the fact that you performed really well with your current level of assignments, and that your boss could use this ability to a higher level. Your sense of guiltiness may not come from your underperformance but from your inability to take a bold move and say : 

I am currently employed at company A and did apply myself for a position at company B and another position at company C. After two interviews at B, company B agreed with me and sent me a job offer. Company C invited me for a second interview in mid January where I personally strongly expsct to get to an agreement too and get an offer mid-end January (no guarantee though, of course). My goals are: 

Why waste storage space by having an Integer variable for this purpose? Use a boolean instead - IsMale: true or false. Null valie if neither male nor female. Problem solved. 

Nope. You are not paid to get work done. Unless you have a contract which says you are getting paid only if you perform work x to amount y. What you are paid for is to get work done, when there is work to be done. In your case, there is currently no work to do, and even if your supervisor confirms this - enjoy the quiet times! You can for example use it for developing your work relevant skills by reading related stuff in the internet. But ask your boss first. 

There are two things to consider and as requested, I'll try to make a general answer. First, the question of how will you get your first contract. Freelancers usually use references and previous work to get contracts. You claim you have no references in this field and no "real" previous work. So you can count only on your persuading skills. You should begin with small projects first so that you can easier convince a potential customer to go with you, and it will allow you to build a portfolio which can get you more contracts later. Second, the question of how you will manage to satisfy your first customer. Suppose you managed to get a contract, congrats: 1/10 of the work is done. Because now you have to deliver so that this first experience translates into a reliable reference. All that said, regarding your question or whether "you're ready or not" - I've seen many freelancers claiming to be "experts" in such field, and it appeared they were really not that proficient. It doesn't mean that you have to do the same and it's not intended to make people lower their mediocrity acceptance threshold. Just that if you have sufficient soft skills and you kind-of know your way in the technical stuff you want to use, then it seems quite doable to get your first contracts. Technically speaking, don't listen to people bashing at freelancers who are in the habit of "learning stuff at the expense of their customers". People (freelancers, employee) are always learning things at the expense of their customers/employers. Except the ones that decide to settle.
