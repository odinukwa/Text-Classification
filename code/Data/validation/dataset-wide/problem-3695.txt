I have a history of injuries, and am no stranger to dealing with them. I had shin splints that developed into stress fractures a year ago. After healing, I have so far managed to prevent their re-occurrence, but at times, I can feel random pain in my tibia. I have been doing careful warm-ups and stretching, and so hope to continue prevention. I have a strange pain in my left calf, along the back side. It is always in the same exact place, and normally subsides after a while. It hurts the worst when I take a step, and have never noticed it when running, only after running. I don't notice it when standing or sitting. I can't figure out what is causing this. It feels like muscle pain. I have two runners knees, and this is developing into quite a serious issue. Two weeks ago I went into complete rest, took a lot of painkillers, and iced multiple times a day. After a week I felt like I was at about 95%, weaned myself off painkillers, and went back to training. For the next week for training I continued icing, and rarely took painkillers. This week the pain is back. It has changed to cover a larger area, travelling into my thighs at times, and sometimes the pain is so great I have difficulty distinguishing where it is coming from. I am not uncomfortable, I can still walk and run, I PR'd last night on my 200m, but I am in constant pain. I've heard that runner's knee is basically just swelling caused by rubbing of the patella against the thighbone. It is not a worrisome pain, it is just painful. I have always had weak knees that popped or bothered me when doing lunges and split squats, and I can no longer do either with a very heavy weight. I have only a month to go before the biggest competition of my life, and I refuse to miss out on this. What should I do? I have looked into k-tape and braces for competition, but don't feel like either would be very helpful. The only thing that makes me feel better is ice and painkillers. 

The foundation of any good diet to make “gains” (build muscle mass) is high quality complex carbohydrates. I.E. oatmeal, sweat potatoes, yams, pumpkins, squash, brown rice, rice. Notice a starch that I left out? Corn. Corn in an unprocessed form is virtual indigestible by humans. Dymatize Elite Mass High-protein muscle gainer primary carbohydrate source is Maltodextrin. *“Maltodextrin can be enzymatically derived from any starch. In the US, this starch is usually corn” This product’s Supplement Facts list 75g of Total Carbohydrate 8g as Sugars. Maltodextrin a heavily processed corn product that while technical not a sugar it is processed very similar to sugar. *“Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose”. Taking Dymatize Elite Mass High-protein muscle gainer before your work out is going to cause a sharp insulin response during your work out which is not what you want. This product is meant to be taken after a workout not before. To answer your question about “what else should I consume to maximize my gains?” 

Are you truly injured? If you are get better and then get back to lifting. Otherwise. Should I reset my weights for a month? No, not if you are following the plan in starting strength. I have read starting strength and it says nothing about a novice lifter de-loading for a month to practice your form. If you are only 2 month into a progressive overload regimented and you are not getting stronger every work out you need to look at your sleep, food, and hydration. If you get your 3x5 on the bench press at 115lb what weight are you doing next session? 120lb or 125lb. That would be a huge jump. In starting strength they would advocate moving up by 2lb. Does your gym have 1lb weights? Use them. If not wedge some 1lb dumbbells that the aerobic classes use under the clips or go to Walmart and buy 2 1lb dumbbells and bring them to the gym with you. Don’t get ahead of yourself. Putting 5lb on your lifts a month is good progress. 

I noticed that you mentioned that you do crossfit regularly in your question. A quick google of crossfit travelling WODs will give you lot of options. This list, which happens to be at the top of the google search, has a lot of good examples. $URL$ I also like this website, which is designed specifically for working out while travelling and has a little more variety than others. $URL$ Get creative and look for unlikely things to use for equipment. You can do a lot with a tabletop or chair. If you want to get a little crazy you could even fill a container with water or use heavy books as weights. If you find it impossible to workout without equipment, most places have parks and playgrounds where you could improvise something. If all else fails, you can always do a few sprints outside. If none of that helps, remember body weight exercises and HIIT are usually equipment free. 

The search also suggested doing these barefoot, something I would heavily agree with. What does your squat form look like? Bending your knees that far forward in a bend, is not particularly healthy, especially when practiced frequently. A deep squat still calls for good form. Have you tried pistol squats, goblet squats, split squats, or lunges? Is your squat wide enough? Are your glutes and hamstrings engaged enough? Are you attempting to do these with weights? I find it easier to go really deep in squats if I am weighted. I like to do squats barefoot, in order to feel exactly what I am doing, but that may be just me. The stretch against the wall thing is not really my favorite, but you will find better results if you keep both of your legs back, and then lean against the wall as close as you can, with your body straight. I would suggest a downwards dog stretch to be more effective. Hobbling your ankles with a band, and then taking small steps to feel where you might be going wrong could be helpful, but don't stop there. There are a lot of options with a band. Also try balancing on a pillow or balsu ball with one leg. Try throwing a ball to someone while balancing on one leg, and eventually work your way up to doing medicine ball tosses on one leg, or twisting your torso from side to side while holding the medicine ball and balancing. Plyometric or hiit workouts in general should help because of the amount of jumping they often involve. For that matter, break out a jump rope! You could try laying on your side with your leg in the air, as if to do a leg raise, and then do ankle rolls with your leg suspended. Being completely warmed up, and doing lots of ankle rolls are really what I think it comes down to. Good luck! 

Besides the obvious Eat, Sleep, and be healthy advice….. Weight Training my help you grow a little with the added production of hGH but the extra height would be negligible and it would be impossible to know. Growth Hormone Treatment is the only real option to affect your height. This is a big step as a specialized doctor needs to closely monitor the Hormone regiment. Given that you are (assumption) an otherwise health 20 year old I doubt if you could find a doctor willing to help you. 

I would pick one sugar or caffeine. It is much more likely that you will fail if you if try to quit both at the same time. To address the question of reducing the craving. 

Definition comes from lowering your Body fat. Chalking up my hands and doing heavy Deadlifting has given me more strength in my forearms than any isolated movement. 

I have dealt with this exact same injury (on the left side). I stopped doing all squats and dead-lifts for 2 month and waited for it to be back to 100%. Berin answer is spot on from my experience. During the 2 month hiatuses I focused on chest supported rowing, (non-chest supported rowing like bent rows caused a similar pain to squatting) LAT pulls, chin up, and more abdominal work. I used the 2 month to focus on my overhead lifts and made more gains in the 2 month than the previous 6. 

Take this as a very extreme answer, and not something that you put into practice, but rather as an example. I used to fast every other week for three days, in order to allow myself to eat like a normal unhealthy person in front of my friends. This lasted for about two months. I would phase out of the fast by gradually building up to carbs in time for the weekend, and I managed to keep weight gain minimal on the binge days. I worked out the same regardless of the fast, and usually by the third day I could see that my muscles were smaller when I flexed, but I was no less strong, and I never had any problem with the workout. After a few days of carefully eating lean protein and lots and lots of raw fruits and vegetables, I would always see my muscle increase in size. In retrospect, I made a lot of physical gains during that time, although the eating habits were not very smart. I had increased my strength and endurance. I took photographs throughout, and a few weeks after I stopped fasting, got my eating in order, and continued to workout in the same way, I definitely had permanent muscle gains. If you are gaining strength, but losing mass, don't worry. Eventually this will even out, if you lose enough weight, the areas that we generally expect to look muscular will, due to less fat surrounding everything. Let me know if was helpful! 

Thinking about what proportion of food you should be eating is fine tuning. How to gain weight? Put butter on everything and fast food. I find consuming simple sugars (soda or tang or juice) will help me keep my appetite up. The real problem is your lack of appetite. Are you hungry a couple hour or so after you work out? If you are not you might not be lifting heavy enough. Is stress killing your appetite? You need to not be stressed. 

Chirstopher’s answer is great. I will just add a couple of my thoughts. Something that might be holding you back are muscle groups other than your shoulders and triceps. Core strength – is your core strong enough that that you don’t shake or wiggle around when overhead pressing. Back strength –a common muscle imbalance that I see in lifters is that the pressing (bench / overhead) is much stronger than there pulling (rows, pull-up, chin ups.) This can be caused by the muscle imbalances inherent in all new lifters and the over emphasis on the pressing exercises. This will limit your ability to control the weight when it is over your head. 

I have worked out for five years. I am 18, 5' female. I am fit, fast, and strong. I know I have made a lot of progress in five years. If I watch what I eat for a week, abs pop out. Yet, I can look at photos from when I was about 12 and I look nearly identical, other than obvious maturing in my face, better posture, and slightly more muscular legs, and slightly broader shoulders. I have gained about 40 lbs, from when I was say, 13, yet I look no different. I even own some of the same clothes. I have totally different eating habits and lifestyle from when I was 12-13, yet I look like I've never been in a weight room. My workouts are designed for me, and they are really good. How come I never got ripped? I want to see those muscles that I can feel. 

What are your goals with crossfit? Compete in the open? Attain better fitness? Lift more? Lose/gain weight/strength? Many crossfitters complain about the lack of balance in workout plans, so you may find that the best course of action is to create your own plan based on the style of crossfit. This is not recommended for beginners, because this may lead to an unhealthy combination of exercises in the same workout, but you said 'assumed fitness and skill level' so I'm assuming that you aren't a beginner. My favorite websites that I find helpful for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of crossfit so that I can formulate my own workout plans based on what pre-made plans don't give me are breakingmuscle.com and theboxmag.com. Both have pre-made workout plans available online, they may be what you are looking for, or they may provide some insight for making your own. Check out the crossfit open prep plans on breaking muscle if you want a long, continuous plan. Both have articles on how to improve your fitness based on crossfit, not to mention both are full of good reading and insight on anything crossfit related or what makes a balanced workout. If you don't find any help here, consider heading to a local box to ask if they can help you come up with something. Most boxes take an interest in other crossfitters, even if you don't workout with them. Let me know if this helps. 

Some tips for Rowing Exercises Have your back fully arced and shoulder blades pinned back as far as you can. There should not be any flexion in your back when you lift whether it is Rows, Squats, or Deadlift Limit your Bicep involvement in back exercises. Hold the weight with just your fingers and NOT in your palms. Do not fully extend your arms to the bottom. Biceps should not be tired or pumped when you are done rowing If you are deadlifting and squatting heavy in the same week do chest supported rows. Do not bend over so far and just do bent rows. Pull up and chin up are great for back development also 

Calf are a small enough muscle group that no matter how many times you work them you are not going to run into over training issue by working them. So work them as much as you want. I think the question that you want to ask is. I’m a novice lifter and I want bigger calves. Should I work my calves 3 times a week? Can’t hurt might not help. It might sound like rhetoric but the squat is king. Squat heavy ass weights, sleep plenty as night and eat a calorie surplus.
