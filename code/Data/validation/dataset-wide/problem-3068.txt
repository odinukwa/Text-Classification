The assertion that there was "never any suggestion that Norman was not happy with the AOC" appears to be quite false, and much of the rest of the quote is implausible to the point of being humorous (supporting material below the fold line, as its bordering on off-topic, unless you are inclined to believe the humbug quoted above). So while I don't think its possible to get perfectly into the heads of the AOC, it does appear to be clear that in 2012 they were not yet ready to admit their organization had participated in the ostracization of Peter Norman. Some of this treatment had been quite recent (only 12 years past), and thus at least a few of the perpetrators likely still had positions of power within the AOC. 

Infectious diseases require a certain critical mass of people to become endemic in a population. Smaller than that, and they burn themselves out by making every susceptible person either immune or dead. The smaller and more isolated the population, the more quickly this happens. Based on what I'm seeing in Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History, Iceland appears to be below this threshold for Smallpox. It had an outbreak in 1670, and then a generation later (1707) another carried over from Denmark. To get from there to the Americas, it would also have to jump from there to Greenland in the short window (roughly 2 years it appears from the records) that its floating around Iceland, and then from there to the mainland, and again from there to the Inuit populations. Inuit did not live in big settlements, so it would have to somehow then get transmitted from small hunting tribe to tribe many times over, crossing several more cultural gradients, until it hit a large city-dwelling culture further south to become endemic in. I've seen multiple claims that Smallpox hit the Greenland settlement in the early 1400's. The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History by Donald R. Hopkins for example. I'm not sure what those claims are based on1. This would be right around the end of that settlement, which by chronology alone would strongly imply the disease was a factor in its demise.2 1 - Anyone? 2 - You could also, purely by this chronology, postulate that this may in fact be what caused the end of the classic ("middle") Mississippians. I'd need to see some actual evidence before thinking this leap reasonable though. 

The big difference is geographic diversity. Wheat doesn't do very well in the tropics. Rice requires tropical and semi-tropical areas where lots and lots of water are available. However, corn can be grown nearly anywhere. Corn kind of had a tough row to hoe (pardon the pun) in the Americas. It was first domesticated from the grass Tseosine in tropical areas of Mexico. However, the geographic axis in that part of the Americas is north-south rather than east-west like in Eurasia. This means that, unlike Eurasian crops, in order to spread to new areas of cultivation, corn had to be bred for new varieties capable of thriving in different lattitudes than it was originally domesticated in. This process took 8 millenia (more if you count in the original Tseosene domstication) to reach up to the lower Mississippi valley. However, once it was completed, Corn became one of the world's only staple grains that can be cultivated both in temperate and tropical climates. 

The report also stated that this seemed to be the majority legal opinion. However, majority doesn't mean universal. Note that "birtherisim" isn't limited to Obama. In fact, his opponent in the 2008 election John McCain, was not born in the United States (although the Canal Zone is a bit a of special case). There were Democratic "birthers" who tried to claim that made him ineligable. The same happened with Barry Goldwater (who was born in Arizona before it was a state), and several others. In George Romney's case, he was born indisputably in another country, but to US citizen parents. He never held citizenship in any country other than the USA. It was an issue when he tried to run for POTUS. 

It wasn't just the newsreels. The ultra-fast talking high-pitched (and almost rhythmic) voice was actually common in media of that era. For example, here's the final scene from Casablanca in 1942. By modern standards, it sounds like a lot of bursts of rapid-fire dialog, interspersed by pauses for you to mentally catch your breath and process what you just heard. Dialog bits from Dragnet are also famous for this, particularly when interrogating suspects. Another thing one may notice is that women are typically portrayed speaking much slower (as are the aforementioned Dragnet interrogation subjects). This is a big clue. Dialog speed was used as a marker for dispassionate intelligence. People talking slower and lower were indicating that they were being more emotional and/or not thinking clearly. A great illustration of this is this other classic Cassablanca scene. Look away from the screen, and pay attention to how fast and low the actors (particularly Ingrid Bergman) speak depending on who they are speaking to and how emotional they are about what they are saying (or how emotional they are trying to be). For instance, whenever anyone is talking about the sentimental song, their voice gets lower and slower. In contrast, when her husband and the Chief show up, both Bergman and Bogart start talking much quicker and higher. To the best of my knowledge, the only person who has looked at this effect from a historical perspective is Maria DiBattista in her book Fast Talking Dames. "Fast Talking" in this context is explained to be an indicator of intelligence and power. As for the unusual accent you are hearing, CGCambell in the comments pointed out that this would have been the "Transatlantic" accent. It was common among the upper class in New York around the turn of the 20th century. Since those were the people who patronized the theater, it was common there as well. When the first media companies started up in New York, they tended to pick it up, as it was a much more "prestigious" accent than the other locally-available alternatives. This was the accent of the late George Plimpton and William F. Buckley Jr. It started to wane after the movie companies moved out to California and much of television production followed. Today most of the accents you hear in American media are a kind of homogenized American Midlands (which many Americans consider "no accent"), with a smattering of weak AAVE used to indicate someone from a rougher background. 

I believe this is referring to the gag rule (aka: Pickney Resolution 3) of the US House, adopted in 1836. It read: 

Mostly he was elected when it was about to happen, and didn't stop it. If you look at the history of US Debt vs GDP, you'll see a fairly clear pattern of event-based upward spikes (colored blue below), followed by periods of slow decline (colored red). 

Nationalism was the defining organizing principle of the 20th Century. Under that Principle, having a country named "Germany" made up primarily of Germans makes perfect sense. Such a country should be stable. There's no real seam for parts of it to separate off into other cohesive units. On the other hand, an "empire" made up of Germans, Hungarians, Romanians, and all manner of different flavors of Slavs, all living mostly in their own self-contained areas is an incoherent mess that's going to take constant effort (likely repression) to keep together. Any unrest in any one area is going to instantly take on the proportions of a Civil War if it isn't contained quickly.
