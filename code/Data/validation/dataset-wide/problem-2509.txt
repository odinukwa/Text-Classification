It is not only you. Everybody have to reap what they sow. Beginningless long samsara that we passed through, all the deeds good or bad just follow you like your own shadow. Even Buddha had these consequences of the long passed samsara. As a Buddhist, true value of triple gem and effect and consequence of karmic result, should be accepted but not blindly. All karma result kaya, versi and manaw done in the past, present and future all have effects. One thing is (huge)good things always have the upper hand over bad ones just like Buddha Dhamma enlighten the darkness of delusion. These present days, if you wish to do/have huge good things, mindfulness in present kaya,versi and manaw act, insight meditation under strong belief in triple gem and karmic effect will only help you. Even large stone that will sink under water can float with the help of large enough boat. Every cloud has a silver lining. To make the most of your misfortune, this is the best time to get enlightened through more concentrated insight meditation reverting all misfortune as your own lesson. As Ledi sayadaw once remind us, just try to loose from the noose when it is time if not you will lost all. 

I recommend Lede Sayardaw practice taught by Sayargyi U Ba Khin and also Mahasi Sayardaw Books for detail reading. But basic technique should be focused on only one. "Breathe in, know it, breathe out, know it" focusing on tip of the nose. It is the simplest one and easiest way to follow. One may think it is the beginning of the practice, but in fact it is the beginning, middle and the final goal to enlightenment. Mahasi Sayardaw technique on noting arising and falling abdomen is if not practiced and have experience first is kind of difficult to follow but once used to it, is also very simple and also lead to the goal. But just take only one otherwise confusing to get progress although it is the very first step. But Mahasi sayardaw books are so convincing and detailed that they are just exactly like meditation master guiding closely to you. Once you get the basic, no need for the retreat. Just continue to practice. The most important thing is one's strong belief in Dhamma and in the meditation master. And one must do practice insight meditation for fear of consequence of Sansara. Only after that one will get enlightened in seven days to seven years as Buddha said. Otherwise just to accumulate merit for the afterlife still it is worth doing. But to get enlightened in this very life must be the target. 

Any food in moderation is enough only one should have it without lobha, dosa and moha. Once in Buddha time , Anagami lady who knew the other's mind, serving the monks who worked hard for enlightenment. The monks without having their food to taste, could not work hard, perceiving that the Anagami lady served according to taste and all monks got enlightened. Again in this story, the monks might come to know the lady who served food knew their mind and tried to get rid of this defilement, better concentrate on meditation and thus got enlightened. All these count. So it depends on individual so far to get moderation and only thing is concentrate on the meditation, purifying the mind, be scare of danger of Sansara and get enlightened. 

Whatever Buddha taught was aimed at attaining nirvana. Vipassana meditation is to achieve nirvana. If you go through this journey, you can pick up something you want on the way. If you do so, there will be the delay and even you may lose bearing. What you mention are just like the stations you have to pass on the journey by train. If you are waiting one by one you will get it but slowly and not all at the same time. If you target at nirvana, you will get these all in a short time definitely. 

You better stick to only one meditation technique of a meditation master. Also it depends on how long you practice each session, to which interval already practiced so that to which level of concentration you achieved, it all depends. Sometimes stages of insight meditation go up and down and sometimes stick to one stage and cannot get through it if not enough concentration. If you focusing on breathing in and out, focusing point to note mindfully at the tip of the nose , if other phenomenon arise only if it is remarkable try to note mindfully as "know it, know it" if it disappears, noting breathing again. If you get concentration more and more, all your noting become so subtle that you noticed nothing. Sometimes just like lack of thought. Then appear again clearer visualizing some phenomenon never seen before. Then all these disappear again slowly disintegrating into smaller ones. This time again sometimes so clear-minded and nondescribable feeling of experience. Like that much more left. Not every one will have similar experience. Based on your previous experience from the beginning of practice and how closely done each session without hiatus so that how deep your concentration achieved it all depends. 

You said "so many things going on at once". Please don't confuse what to do. Only to note mindfully what is most distinct once at a time. Nature of mind can focus only one phenomenon at one moment. For example, if you feel cold with water, just note "cold". It is enough. Without any frustration to note all other things like in wide and spread noting which you will get it automatically at higher nana stage with better concentration. Not to miss noting the single phenomenon is more important than noting nothing which will lead to delusion. But to achieve in every day chore mindfulness, you must have enough Samadhi through your sitting meditation sometimes it works better but depend on the individual. 

Which meditation method you are doing? Whenever you do insight meditation, the most important thing, strong belief in your meditation master and meditation technique. Once one undergo some kind of strong experience either tolerable or not, then he/she must know these are the consequences of before-life experience or the experience in this very life before this practice. So please don't disappoint at what occurring. Please stick to the practice. Nothing is permanent. Strong belief and effort will lead you to another step. 

It is just simple. The hierarchy is sila(at least five precepts for lay man),Samadhi(concentration),and insight knowledge. To achieve this in order, the very first thing is one's strong believe in Dhamma and the meditation master who can teach you in every detail. Just like inertia, if one not yet start , it is difficult to do so. But one of the encouraging fact is the will to do so if one has, it the very beginning. Throughout Sansara, all these defilement clinging to one mind but insight meditation if properly done no matter one has all the misdeeds except the great five ones. So as a very step go to a retreat you rely on where you can find a god master, and start this hierarchy relentlessly at least for 2 weeks. If you have the basic after that you can proceed at home whenever you find time. As mentioned earlier, just to start. If concentration moment accumulate from second to minute to hour , you will find the progress. 

Depend on the individual's concentration. One should focus on either tip of the nose noting "breathe in, know it, breathe out, know it", not too fast, not too slow, just like normal breathing one get used to do. If mind is wandering about just a little faster, but just to note "wandering, wandering", then focus on tip of nose breathing. Mind used to get astray, just note "know it" without any wishing to grasp it. It is Anatta. Yogi wish is to grasp it, but mind used to get wander and just know it once it get wander. Then focus on breathing. 

Only mindfulness will bring everything in order. Just focus on breathing. Knowing out-breath, knowing in-breath is enough. Whenever the mind wander, just pay attention on out-breath, in-breath. In the early moment, one cannot focus on it as mind wander outside. As time goes by, concentration arise and it is very clear. Dhamma will show by itself. Some people may think, it is the beginning of meditation. But later he/she will know this out-breath in-breath noticing is all the way from beginning, middle and the end, the only way to nibbana, no two. 

Whatever Buddha taught, it is for nirvana. Each and every person used to get attain nirvana in different way. Only Buddha know the exact way to achieve nirvana in different person with different background. So Buddha taught in different ways and not every words of Buddha is recorded in Tripitaka. When orally one learn from the enlightened, it goes deep down to heart even can get nirvana before ending of verse. Orally received teaching vibrate your entire heart and can tame even the animal to get to higher abode. If you have chance to listen to the Dhamma of some great venerable monk, you will know what it means.
