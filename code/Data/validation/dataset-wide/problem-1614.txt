Source: New York Times article on Mosquitoes Cool Down during Blood Feeding to Avoid Overheating - Lahondère and Lazzari, Curr Biol. 2012 The pee is not the cause of the allergical 'itch'. The mosquito's saliva is the cause of that effect - it injects it to prevent coagulation in the blood. 

A journal article on the topic found a negligible (but non-zero) effect of carbonated waters on tooth enamel. The claim in the Daily Mail is clearly in dissonance with the results from this study. 

The article you link to quotes Debby Herbenick for this statement. There are studies showing the levels of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) are increased after morning exercise and studies that indicate increased levels of IgA correlated with sexual activity. IgA has been shown to be vital in mucosal immunity. 

Scope: My answer comprises sources that support efficacy for the Heimlich Maneuver to alleviate choking, and sources that show a lack of evidence for a comparison with other methods. I consider only the risks and benefits in healthy individuals between the ages of 1 and 65 of the maneuver for Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO). I interpret 'most appropriate' as 'the method with highest patient survival rate'. Out of scope: Drowning (which is not choking, and even Heimlich has retracted support there), infants, the elderly, the sick, Heimlich's son hating him, Heimlich's personal flaws and support of controversial AIDS cures. 

There is another wear-related problem with the Möbius-band: conveyed material rests getting between belt and the rolls (e.g. if you convey sand or stones, you will get little grains in between there, and that will cause lots of wear) So you probably could use it only for certain applications, because for other applications you may end up with even more wear than not turning the belt at all. Note that if the surface wear does limit the life time, but is different on the material and on the machine side of the belt, you may not get any benefit from turning - but then it is questionable, whether the Möbius-band helps at all. However, I'm not sure at all whether this kind of surface wear was/is really what limits the life of these belts. Maybe someone else can add wisdom? I have a bit of experience with flat transmission belts in "ancient" machinery. They don't get "thin" at the surface, they will usually rip across (the old leather belts regularly needed to be repaired), maybe because of a little cut at the side that propagates quickly. 

The FDA has a number of "sped up" programs for drug approval, that on the first glance seem to fit the claim (I don't have access to the full paper). 

There are many claims around about clothes made of linen being useful in warmer climates. Usually it includes explanations such as a better transportation for sweat so it can evaporate more easily, or that it allows for wind to pass through. I'm wondering about the claim that skin temperature is reduced by over 3°C... 

(source: J Oral Rehabil. 2001 Aug;28(8):766-72) The idea that carbonated water harms teeth may be based on the fact that dissolving carbon dioxide in water results in some carbonic acid. However, this did not result significant enamel decay. 

The Benefits Informally, many people have been reported to have survived after having been administered the Heimlich maneuver. Some people reportedly still breathing after the technique include Ronald Reagan, Elizabeth Taylor and Goldie Hawn. Usually, these reports describe people choking on solid food items. Apart from the study below, I have found no non other scientific sources that showed statistics (other than Heimlich's own reports). 

Unless the esophagus is fully blocked Raising the arms will therefore increase oxygen uptake in healthy people, which may make you feel like you are not choking anymore. Note though that raising the arms is not an appropriate method to help a person who is actually choking. Unless the person is able to breathe adequately the Heimlich maneuver should be performed if coughing does not solve the problem. [warning, anecdotal] My tennis trainer always told us to put our arms up and breathe in when panting after a demanding exercise. During Yoga and other 'breathing exercises' the arms are usually also repositioned to either limit or maximize lung volume. 

You are asking three different things, and I think that is the cause of the confusion here. "As good as new" is something quite different from "safe", and still different from whether replacing the tire it is a good idea. 

Conclusion of this search: long distance drivers certainly prefer diesel (the < 5 year olds). Nowadays, gasoline cars can reach the same mileage of several 100.000 km (inspecting the higher mileages of the < 5 and 5 - 10 year old cars - disregarding > 999.999 km, as one needs to carefully look for typos that add a digit and obviously meaningless mileages like the 999999). 

In other words, the studies population are boys who got radiotherapy because of tumours on the skin of the head or somewhere else. I assume (though I did not find that clearly stated in the text!) that the controls are boys that got radiation therapy for this type of tumour somewhere else than the head and neck region. IMHO the more interesting control group would have been boys who had the hemangiomas on head and neck but did not get radiation therapy (stratified for severity of the tumour / the radiation dose they "should" have gotten). Or at least, one would need to establish that high school attendance of people with untreated infantile hemangiomas was the same compared to boys without hemangiomas (probably not, if "only" because of the psychosocial difficulties in school). Now according to this webpage these hemangioma are benign tumours, 60% of them appear on head and neck. But a particular form of these hemangioma appears within the PHACE syndrome, which also includes brain malformations and other problems. I have no information about the frequency of this, but it would have been good if the Swedish study had explained if any/how many such patients were in their patient population. The other point that needs to be kept in mind is that according to Benner 2001 the cancer risk decreases with the age of the child when the CT takes place. The Swedish boys were less than 1 1/2 years old when they got radiotherapy. Now cancer isn't the same as not attending high school, but this tells something about how sensitive the brain reacts to radiation.

source: Soroudi A. et al., 2011 The US National Library of Medicine advocates using the technique after less dangerous methods have been exhausted. Their source for claiming so is Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice. The maneuver is still taught in many classes. Reported Detractors The Red Cross has published guidelines in 2006 that do still show the Heimlich maneuver. The change is that first slaps on the back are recommended, and only then abdominal thrusts (Heimlich). This has been reported to be downgrading or detracting from the Heimlich maneuver. However: 

When we got our new puppy I laid a great lawn on our balcony (an amazing 1m2 patch of grass) that sadly had to be replaced after a few weeks due to yellow spots. I found a product with the name Dog Rocks that is said to prevent this issue. There are some sketchy claims on the site - such as that the pH of dog pee remains the same, and ammonia in water being reduced (was I giving my little dog ammonia!?). A study by McGill University is given as evidence here. Are "Dog rocks" more useful than pet rocks? They definitely seem to be sold a lot going by Amazon's number of reviews for them. 

It is easy to find evidence about the danger of improper tire repair, like this. However, I did not find any statistics on the reliability of properly done repair. To add 3 more data points to the discussion: I've personally been driving 3 tires (light truck 2.8 t, vmax 110 km/h) that had been punctured (by something leaving < 1mm hole) on a parking and have been repaired. I never drove them at too low pressure. I've been driving then something between 25000 and 50000 km thereafter. I have to double-check but I think one of them is still "in service". The others meanwhile were replaced, but their "end" had nothing to do with that puncture or repair. That is 0 repair-related failures out of 3 cases, which translates to a 95% confidence interval for the true probability of a failure after properly done repair between 0 and 70%. This illustrates that 3 data points do not allow much conclusions. But they are a starting point for collecting more evidence. Last, but not least, for the third question you ask "Should I buy a new tire?", I recommend quickly calculating how much a new tire costs, and balance that againt the hours you're still going to spend on worrying about the repaired tire. Could it be that the hourly wage for your worries is very low? In that case, you may want decide to buy a new tire regardless of the technical condition of the repaired tire. 

Source: Asian J Sports Med. Sep 2012; 3(3): 185–192. Therefore, it seems fair to assume a positive effect on IgA levels from morning sex. Based on the study by Hejazi and Hosseini, I'd advise the 'short drill' version to avoid an inadvertent negative effect stemming from endurance exercise. 

source: "Business Insider: Health Medical Dr. Heimlich Is Horrified By The Red Cross' Protocol For Saving Choking Victims" Heimlich himself at 96 did administer his eponymous technique to a woman in his retirement home with effective results, so he obviously still stands by his original claims. 

(source: Psychol Rep. 2004 Jun;94(3 Pt 1):839-44.4) Finally, there have been studies on the effects on the immune system in the broader category of physical exercise too. The positive effects found from such exercise indicate that the source effect is not purely from sex, but either additive or interactive with the effect from generic physical activity. 

Their claim notes the source as "Census Bureau data by the Journal of Blacks in higher education", which I couldn't find a more specific resource for. Are these statements otherwise verified? I can imagine African immigrants having the highest immigration demands of any group, but the statements still seem counter-intuitive considering funding issues for academia in large parts of Africa. 

Possible source of the error: While the claim correctly cites the lethal dose of 1-2 mg/kg bodyweight their wording 

Diesel engines used to be not only lower specific power but also slower max speed and lower power / car weight. This means that preferred driving style could pretty much decide the type of engine. Gasoline for "sportive" driving style (which is much more demanding on the car, lots of load-cycle changes), diesel for calm/slow driving style. The "long-lasting" was an important sales argument, aiming at people who drive a lot. This means, that those cars were more likely to end up far more in long-distance driving than gasoline cars at the time. While the question is about modern diesel engines, I think this historic situation needs to be taken into account because that is where the long-lasting reputation of the diesel comes from. Note for judging the OP's article that it was also not a "cheaper" but a "more economic if you go long distances" reputation. And it was no "cheaper repair" reputation. Meanwhile diesel car engines have much higher specific and total power. Look e.g. at the BMW N57 engines (e.g. 242 kW, 4.4 l) or the Mercedes-Benz W221 (235 kW, 4 l) Those BMW 7 series and Mercedes S class diesel cars are restricted to vmax 250 km/h, just like the gasoline ones (though these series have gasoline engines with still more power). Hints about the lifetime of modern diesel engines.
