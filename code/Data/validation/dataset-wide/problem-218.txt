Not sure if this is quite the same, but perhaps the leading-away bit might be more important than the chase or the test of vigor. I'd thought, the male might use the chase to lure the female away (from something)...leading directly to the question of what they needed to be led away from and why it was advantageous enough they would stick around often enough to require luring from the males. So, one option I thought of was, have the females in packs - perhaps all the time, or during season. There might be any number of advantages, from cooperative hunting to mutual defense, that would encourage such packs to form. I think having them seasonally pack up might work better, since I think they'd be less likely to have an established hierarchy than if they ran together year-round, doubly so if travel (between areas or else between female packs of an area, somehow) was not unknown. So the way I picture this working is, there's a strong mating drive when the females are in season. A female witnessing a mating close to them may act aggressively, go and interrupt the mating - possibly injuring one of them - since the other female is competition for males, and any offspring would be competition for their own offspring. It would probably start off as a pure dominance play, so that only the strongest females in a pack mated (those that could prevent interruption), with males luring the females away from the pack being a way to game the system, so to speak. In this scenario, a male that lures a female further from the rest of the pack before being 'caught' would have better chances of mating without being interrupted or dealing with aggression from other females, possibly injuries. A female that catches their male early, closer to their pack territory etc, will have a better chance of getting back to the pack and possibly interrupt other females mating, giving more chances for dominance, a higher position in the pack (possibly a larger share of food), and/or less competition to their offspring. One possible consideration that could drive behavior in a different direction would be to have males wait out of range to ambush those that were leading females, and fighting to mate the lured female (with the challenger presumably less tired than the one who was chased). This could be minimized by having the female respond better to a male they chased (due to some courtship signals, etc at the beginning or during the run) or else have a higher chance of them being aggressive with a male that attempts to interrupt much like they would be with a female attempting to interrupt, as a callback to the times when breeding rights were a dominance issue to the females. 

I think the answer might lie in the fact you've let them have the ability to smell blood. Obviously, they can pick up the difference between blood and water, so some signal is already reaching them - so once the first scouts have reached the wound, they just need something to change the smell of the blood, rather than trying to send a signal independently. Probably anything reacting with or changing the chemical properties of blood will also change the smell. So, what might your Mistraille use? Probably a chemical that's useful to them in its own right, waste not and all that. I was thinking about anti-clotting chemicals (warfarin or heparin) - since they need the open wound to get in, better keep that access open (also, vampire bats have a similar adaption, anticoagulants in their saliva, so this is not an unknown possibility). Otherwise, they might use a sedative, or some enzyme that will help them feed later, who knows? the important thing would be to change the scent of the blood, and use that to signal the rest of the colony. Alternatively, the Mistraille could be feeding on something in the blood, and that feeding (or lack of whatever substance or chemical), is what changes the scent of the blood and draws in the rest of the swarm. And maybe it would make sense that the change is small at first - maybe the first scouts make a little change, which draws in more of the swarm, who add more chemical and change the blood scent more, until the whole swarm is involved. The other thing I was thinking about anticoagulants, if they can't be smelled in blood (I can't smell well enough to test, so, shrug) they can still serve as the basis for a crude signal. The very first scouts release a little of the chemical - so the wound doesn't clot, and starts bleeding more, so the smell of blood is stronger. Which entices more of the Mistraille to venture in, and narrow into the location the blood scent is coming from. The second load of scouts again increases the concentration of whatever chemical they're using, so the blood smells stronger, and more enticing (from the blood, and the chemical signaling, and because they're hungry). So then it turns into a feedback situation, where the more Mistraille get into the wound, the better the blood smells (from added chemicals and more freely flowing blood) until the whole swarm is committed (probably within a few minutes, depending on chemical reaction time). Probably from the second or third layer of scouts, the Mistraille would have follow-up scouts close enough to the 'loss of contact' area to pinpoint exactly where the wound is, and be close enough to catch a fairly weak signal from the ones in blood contact, that signal to the swarm that actual contact was made (not just contact with a nearby water source). So, to fool them would take more than a wound and location, it would need an animal bleeding out right next to a water source (since the smell has to increase the whole time), and since they're arrowing in on the smell as the signal, it would have to be right next to or actually bleeding into the water. 

I would suggest dogs. Granted, they're pack animals - but there's a reason to disregard that rule at least a little. Your mad scientist wants the animal to defend him - and as the primary rule, I would think it has precedence over other rules. There are very few critters we can trust to do this! Solitary hunters will not only probably not defend someone, he's likely to be breakfast unless he can defend himself against the critter - always, at all times, and in all situations... and any weakness he can reliably exploit, will weaken the animal down from super-predator. A couple other answers mention tigers, this would be the reason to say no to them. So dogs, long domesticated and quite easy to work with, would be a viable possibility. The scientist could choose between breeds for the best fit for his location (terrain and temperature), and likely predators, and further modify the creatures if needed (perhaps venom?) - if the pack can face or fight any creature, than something like venom would make sure it doesn't survive easily. Even without venom, they might be able to fight and scare off many animals by claiming territory. Otherwise, perhaps domestic cats might form the basis for a possible solution, if the requirement against pack animals is set in stone. Again, while many larger cats are fierce predators which would need little modification - they are solitary, can't really be trained (not like dogs, anyway) and would turn on your scientist at their convenience. Lions are one possible exception to the antisocial status of larger cats - but as pride animals, they're right back to breaking the solitary rule. The tamable heritage of domestic cats would probably outweigh their smaller size - and perhaps they can't be trained, but they can be taught. Your scientist might try increasing their size (midsize will let it hunt large prey, but any larger and it might threaten your scientist), or adding venom - or indeed poison, since their opponent is then still dead if it preys on them. Having venom will help the cat take out not only its own prey, but will injure or kill any animal it fights in self-defense as long as it can achieve one good bite. If the cats are properly socialized and well treated, they may face off against animals many times their size (big dogs, possibly even a bear) to protect their "own" - including their human, their claimed territory, or their fellows. They may coexist as a group in the base (make sure your scientist claims the position of boss cat, to minimize infighting) or possibly when facing off larger threats (like said tigers), yet will still hunt alone. Also, cats do not kill only to eat - they will often kill more than they need, for sport or to 'offer' their people. That kind of prey drive will certainly help keep them fighting and killing different kinds of animals near the base. (note: I recommend adding venom to an already formidable creature rather than using one already venomous for the same reason I discourage tigers - most won't defend, and are a risk to, your mad scientist. Most animals go either/or for venom or fighting, because either form of being dangerous is expensive... but if you're engineering an animal anyway might as well stack advantages. So, when adding venom - first, your animal should be immune to its own venom, or it will not be useful. And your mad scientist should both build up a resistance/immunity and have an antivenom. Also, venom doesn't guarantee a kill - some percentage of bites will be dry, it takes time for the venom to work, it takes time to renew the venom, and some animals will be able to resist based on compatibility or body size. What it will do is increase your creature's success, since other animals who get dosed will be weakened by the venom (and the bite), leaving it vulnerable to your creature's other weapons (claws and fangs) with the added bonus of leaving an animal that survived and escaped weakened and vulnerable to death by other causes. Extra note, make the poison fangs the same or smaller than other teeth, the better to not break off. As a secondary weapon, it's not a problem if it doesn't activate except during a solid bite) 

Pick your most influential religious leaders, your top political leaders, your little local pillars of the community known for being the most faithful and devoted followers - not more than 1% of your total population of each, maybe aim for just under 2-2.5% total instead, since you want to keep as much wiggle room as you really can. You are ranking people by how many others look up to them, how faithful and devout they are perceived by the community, how influential they are. Have your god go to them - yes, this means they won't disbelieve in him, but if your god chose wisely, they wouldn't have anyway - have your god go to them and set them each a test of personal devotion: that they must not publicly support your god for a year, even publicly deny him. They may not explain or discuss their reasons until the year is up. If your god wants to be a little more sympathetic, would not like to be seen as insecure, or would like to eventually be worshiped again, have him blame the boojum. 

You have a year of this - and you want people to have as much time as possible, to react to each wave of defections, the better to seriously shake their faith. You want to minimize the number of people your god visits, too - you will want as much wiggle room as you can for people who won't lose faith naturally, and you have already shaved that thin with your visitation people. Honestly, I would be surprised if you couldn't get a pretty decent majority seriously doubting the god, with shenanigans like this, and perhaps your 95% will be willing to profess disbelief by the time your year is over. Maybe that's enough, maybe not - but it is about all I've got. 

To fool forensics, you need to defeat their databases - and databases are not magic, they have limited stuff in them depending on what's useful. If you just want to fool a forensic lab that focuses on criminal activity, it will have a database of human-made substances, and local biological substances, and lots of capability to pick up the stuff that points to human variations and actions - but they won't have every exotic animal ever, and may be stumped by some substance or specific composition that's common to a locale halfway around the world. If you pick something suitably exotic, or start messing with gene splicing from those exotic roots, you might end up with a puzzle that might stump them for quite some time. The problem with that is, humans escalate - having stumped your local police-oriented forensics, they will escalate - to national databases, to scientific ones, to hunting down common threads (kinda-sorta-maybe like that is pretty weak, but if it's all you have...) and finding specialists. And for something as attention grabbing as aliens, this will be getting the kind of attention to keep escalating to those higher databases and more specialized scientists. Every database that fails to find a match will increase interest, which means more scrutiny for any small mistake you may have made. Practically - you should take an interest in cutting edge biology - the stuff interested in studying bacterial cultures of thermal vents or sulfur pools or other deeply unexplored areas - ones where new discoveries, different species, and unstudied adaptions are likely to be found. You need contacts in the field - so you know what's going on, what ideas are being tossed around, and also physical access to sample stuff. Obviously it will be best if you and any co-conspirators can study and get samples without anyone knowing anyone has done so, but a good compromise might be being knowledgeable enough to be able to eventually throw investigators off the trail when they reach your level of specialization. Then, play around with whatever you've got - maybe gene splice things that kinda work together and kinda don't... or maybe skip that, because artificial is probably easier to discover than simply exotic. After all, the techniques that splice genes together that we know enough to use, we also know enough to detect - but genuinely exotic fragments can be mixed and assumed 'damaged', or interesting substances simply harvested - something greasy for the base of your 'fingerprint oil', something thickly liquid for a 'blood' analogue, some strand of proteins for a 'hair' - such substances that can be muddled with traces of your gene-spliced bits so that they seem to work together. There's several layers of materials that can be layered together to make a really surprising picture - DNA fragments, proteins, lipids, chemical reactions, trace elements. You don't have to make them work together seamlessly, you just need to have enough puzzle pieces working together to suggest enough of a picture and make your researchers fill in the blanks... and enough blanks to make the bits that really don't fit, look like the problem was the gaps. For example, using a medley of sulfur bacteria DNA with some of the kind of oils found in (or useful to) a sulfur-rich environment, and traces of sulfuric acid at the scene, for example, can let traces of proteins or other structures not usually found in sulfur-environments (maybe from something seagoing, or from insects, or even vegetation) seem exotic and/or alien instead of cobbled together. Or if you want your 'fingertips' to have hexagon-patterns, use bits of DNA from species with hexagon-coloration, or a tendency to use hex patterns for building with (like bees' hexagon-shaped cells in honeycomb), or something. Then - build your 'crime scene'. Carefully, and preferably with no real crime involved (the better to invoke scientific curiosity, rather than outrage, and to make it as low-priority as you can). Your robot hands gets a tiny smear of 'fingerprint oil', and touches or grabs what you need it to, maybe a few bits of other evidence like alien blood, skin cells, hairs (depending on your harvested material-alike's). It will be much better if you build a clear picture of what was happening (it stood here, grabbed that, knocked something over) as that kind of material picture is the strength of police-type forensics anyway. Then destroy swathes of this evidence... wipe things down with sulfuric acid, 'attempt' to set a fire, basically assume your alien didn't wanna be caught - but that it 'missed things'. This will help explain why you've got partial prints, fragments of DNA, plenty of evidence of your oils, prints, and various fluids - but not a lot actually in a state to be tested, and plenty of reason for the tests to find gaps where things are missing. After all, the best way to hide that the puzzle didn't start with all its bits, is to make sure they're expecting not to find all the bits. The more you paint a bigger picture, the better everything will work because people like narratives, they want the story to make some kind of sense - so you wait for external factors (meteor shower, or storms, whatever fits) and maybe use a series of 'scenes' to hint at a larger picture or provide frame for that narrative. One scene might be an anomaly, several as the 'alien' seemed to move in search of something, was maybe avoiding something, until whatever happened. Again, you don't need answers so much as hints that there might be some reason only partial evidence remains. The alien needed something, it crashed, it was looking for someone, it left, it died (and no remains because...). They say earthworms and humans share about 98% of all DNA-structures, from having evolved in similar environments and having similar distant-ancestral goop. That means, something only a little bit different - say, sharing even 95% of our structures, is still pretty likely to get touted as alien. Sulfur pool or thermal vent bacteria might qualify - they're living in a very different environment, after all. Bonus points if you can incorporate things that seem mistaken or wrong until someone gets far enough up the scientific ladder to say, actually it works - it leads them in the direction of science-we-dont-know-yet instead of hoax, since a hoax is a lot more likely to use things people know or assume, than those scientifically correct but seemingly unknown. (extra bonus points if this is a discovery new and/or obscure enough that even scientists in the field might need to double-check if it really works.) And even after that similarity has been tracked down, especially if you're using the really cutting edge of discovered species, you might be able to persuade them the similarity is about as coincidental to your aliens as earthworms' are to ours, instead of being muddled from them - that is, about similar environment and convergent evolution/adaptation, starting from an environment that is rare on earth, but must be more common wherever these aliens are from - your sulfur-abundant world, or one run on heat instead of light (from a thermal-vent themed selection). If you're very careful, and have lots of resources, and a fair amount of luck - you might manage something, that fools them for a time (and if everything runs in your favor and that time is decades or a century or so, I would count that a success). In time, of course, technology will advance far enough to simply overcome your obfuscations, since you are limited by whatever tech you had to start with. All due credit for inspiration goes to the Cottingly Fairies hoax, whose photographs could not be proved to be altered because what they manipulated was the scene being photographed, instead. Keep people focused on the bits that aren't a hoax (use real materials, for example, your bacterial DNA is biological) and the bits that are (location, robotic hand with hexagon-fingerprints) can get glossed right over.
