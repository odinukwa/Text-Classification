A bit long for a comment. I like this question because as far as I know there are a lot of open problems concerned with expressing the links you mentioned via combinatorics. Perhaps you'd be interested in the following: "On some combinatorial and algebraic properties of Dunkl elements" - Anatol Kirillov. The basic idea in that paper is that certain specializations and multiparameter deformations of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials can be expressed through Narayana numbers, Catalan-Hankel determinants, and Schroder numbers, including some generalizations as well. In addition, these specializations come up in other areas such as $k$-triangulations of convex polygons and Carlitz-Riordan numbers. Through the wonderous abstract nonsense of Flags and degenerate loci, you can perhaps glean some knowledge. 

Let $A$ be an $(m \times n)$ integer matrix (if it helps, we can assume that a is a square matrix). Let $d_i,\ldots,d_s$ be the elementary divisors of $A$. I am interested in the product $\prod_{i=1}^s d_i$. I know that I can determine this by looking at the gcd of the determinants of $(s \times s)$-submatrices. Is there any other way to determine this product? In particular I am interested in the case when $A$ is a square matrix with $\det(A)=0$ and I have no useful information about the eigenvalus of $A$. 

In a paper of Cohn (see here), he uses some formulae involving congruences of Lucas- and Fibonacci-numbers (equations 11,12,13 in the preliminaries section). Does anyone know a source for these (and maybe even for more equations of this type)? 

If we localize at all weak equivalences, the localization $L^W(Top)$ will be equivalent to the homotopy category of CW-complexes $Ho(CW)$. This can be seen using the fact that for each topological space there is a weakly equivalent CW-complex (the cellular approximation) and the fact that on CW-complexes the weak equivalences are exactly the homotopy equivalences (Whitehead theorem). However, we can also localize the category of topological space at the homotopy equivalences. Then we will get the Homotopy category of all topological spaces $Ho(Top)$. The fact, that if $f, g: X \to Y$ are homotopic, that they are equal in the localization, can be seen using the fact that the cylinder $X \times I$ used to define homotopy is isomorphic to $X$ in the homotopy category. This then shows that there is a functor $F: Ho(Top) \longrightarrow L^W(Top) \cong Ho(CW)$ But there is of course also the inclusion $Ho(CW) \to Ho(Top)$ which is right inverse to $F$. 

In formula 4.224 12 in the 8. edition of the Table of Integrals, Series, and Products is an error: In the case $a^2=1$ both equations should hold, but they are not equal. I think the second equation (i.e. $\int_0^\pi \ln(1+a\cos x)dx = 2 \pi \ln \frac{|a|}{2}$ ($a^2 \geq 1$) is wrong and it should be $$\int_0^\pi \ln((1+a\cos x)^2)dx = 2 \pi \ln \frac{|a|}{2}$$ This would also solve the problem, that the argument of the logarithm gets negative if $a^2 \geq 1$. Can someone confirm this and/or does someone know how to prove this? 

Is there something known about the values of the Kronecker symbol $\left(\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\right)$ if $a_n$ is a recursive sequence? I know something about this if $a_n$ is the Fibonacci sequence or the Lucase sequence and for a given sequence, these symbols can be computed. Nevertheless, it would be great to have some results that hold for all recursive sequences of the form $a_{n+1} = \alpha \cdot a_n + \beta \cdot a_{n-1}$ for some $\alpha, \beta$ independent (or even dependent) of $n$. 

You can construct the map $K(\mathbb{Z},3) \to tmf$ as follows: first there is the String orientation of tmf, which you already mention. This is a map $$ MString \to tmf$$ Then String is by definition a $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$-fibration over Spin. This yields in particular a map $$ K(\mathbb{Z},3) \to MString $$ Then you can construct the map $K(\mathbb{Z},3) \to tmf$ as the composition of the above two maps. In order to extend this constuction you had to find a map $BBU_\otimes \to MString$. I think such a map does not exist apart from the one you describe, but I am not entirely sure. 

The fundamental group $\pi_1(G)$ is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral lattice by the inverse roots. A nice exposition (also including answers to the other questions) is in Chapter V (7) of "Broecker , tom Dieck - Representations of compact Lie groups (Springer 1985)." 

If you want, you can use Lambert's W function. Let $z:=x+4$, so that the equation becomes $3^{z-4}=z$, so that $-3^{-4}=-z3^{-z}$, which upon inverting with Lambert's $W$ gives: $x=-\frac{W(-\ln(3)3^{-4})}{\ln(3)}-4$ In particular, $W(r)$ has a nice taylor expansion: $W(r)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1}n^{n-2}}{(n-1)!}r^n$ 

The Uniform Boundedness Principle, Open Mapping Theorem, Closed Graph Theorem are all derived via Baire Category theorem (they can all be derived from each-other as well). 

I was thinking that the Hillman-Grassl correspondence would be useful here: every such partition bijects to a function $f:\lambda\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$. However, there are two things that are unclear to me here. First, is there an obvious restriction on $f$ to give $k$-bounded weak reverse partitions? Second, the bijective aspect of the correspondence gives two relations: $$|\pi|=\sum_{v\in\lambda}f(v)h(v),$$ where $|\pi|=\sum_{ij}\pi_{ij}$ and $h(v)$ is the hook-number of the cell $v$. Equivalently, summing over all partitions, $$\sum_{\pi}q^{|\pi|}=\prod_{v\in\lambda}\frac{1}{[h(v)]_q},$$ where $[\cdot]$ is the $q$-analogue. In both of these equations, I fail to see how one would obtain a uniform measure on the all such partitions. Is there maybe a hook-walk-like algorithm that could generate the appropriate class of $f$'s? Or perhaps there is a direct way to generate the $\pi_{ij}$? 

The answer is no. For an arbitrary simplicial space $X_\bullet$ we can consider $|X_\bullet|$ as a constant simplicial space, lets call this $Y_\bullet$. Then there is clearly the identity $|X_\bullet| \to |Y_\bullet|$, but there is in general no nontrivial map $X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ (take e.g. BG for a top. group $G$). 

The converse is true. You can see this for example as follows: first since DG-categories admit a model structure each morpism $A \to B$ in Ho(dgCat) can be realized as a 3-step span like this $A \leftarrow A' \to B' \leftarrow B$ (here $A'$ is a cofibrant replacement and $B'$ is a fibrant replacement). Then such a morpism is an isomorphism in the homotopy category be the 2-out-of-3 property if and only if the middle morphism $A'\to B'$ is a weak equivalence. Thus each isomorphism in the homotopy category comes from a Zig-Zag of weak equivalences (and this argument is valid in each model category). 

I was wondering, whether the Repdigit $77...77$ (i.e. the number all of whose digits are $7$) can be the sum of two squares for some number of digits. With elementary methods I could show, that if this can happen, the number of digits must be a multiple of $198$. The phenomenon that occurs (for the numbers I examined) is, that every time I have enough digits to "square" a prime divisor $p$ with $p \equiv 3 \mod 4$, I get new (and even more) single prime divisors $p \equiv 3 \mod 4$. So I suppose, that none of these numbers can be written as the sum of two squares. Does anyone have an idea of how to prove (or disprove) that?
