Humans are derived from arboreal shrew-like animals that survived the cataclysm which wiped out the larger dinosaurs. As far as I am aware this series of events is entirely the result of chance. Would being marsupials have adversely affected the development of heuristics, tool use, civilization, etc? 

What advantages do vehicles modeled after ants, spiders, centipedes, squids, etc offer over conventional land, sea and air vehicles? EDIT: This question does not relate to human-shaped bipedal robots. Those are obviously impractical due to the square-cube law. Vehicles with multiple limbs have been seriously advanced for climbing and space exploration. What other circumstances would justify this design? 

There are few examples of radiotrophic ecosystems on Earth. Of those discovered, the radiotrophs are limited to single-celled organisms and unique mutant fungi. The reason seems to be due to a lack of concentrated radiation. The Chernobyl reactor is an energy source similar to a star or steam vent, able to support more complicated organisms. What would be a natural equivalent that would drive high energy ecosystems seen on the surface and deep sea? 

If you're willing to use a bit of artistic license: Pick an important-but-obscure chemical like Germanium or Gallium. Say the entire supply was destroyed - maybe it only occurs in one place, and rogue states destroyed it? Or take some historical industrial health problem like ethylene glycol ethers, fictionalise a Chernobyl scale accident, and claim the safe alternatives just couldn't perform as well. 

Just make the monsters less powerful I've seen post-apocalyptic TV shows where, for reasons of plot and their contracted number of episodes, it's preordained that any time the characters are safe, a new threat will arise. The characters have holed up in an impenetrable underground bunker? The monster of the week can teleport. My point being: It's easy to construct a world where it's impossible for any humans to survive. If you want humans to survive, you have to not do that. You can change your world so it doesn't have tunnelling, flying, wall-destroying, swimming, rock-climbing, too-smart-to-poision monsters. Transport is irrelevant if nowhere has a surplus of food It's all very well to get food by trade - but a city will only export food if they have more than they need. For trade to make sense, there have to be some areas of your planet that can produce more food than they need. And if there's a place that can produce enough food, why would a settlement form in an area that can't produce enough food? People who are starving either move or die. Seems to me such a settlement would only form if they could do something valuable that couldn't be done elsewhere, such as natural resource extraction. If you're a mining outpost, why would you waste workers running an unproductive farm when those guys could be mining while the farming is done elsewhere? Get strong at calorie density Give your world something like 'lembas' or the food bars from Firefly, so places like mining colonies only need a single heavily guarded shipment every few months. Carrion / Get strong at preserving I'm sure some of these monsters die of natural causes, or from fights with other monsters. A hog the weight of a person is enough to feed 100 people - so if some of your monsters are edible and elephant-sized, that could keep a small settlement in food for a long time. Your society will have to be good at preserving, of course. Form a symbiotic relationship There are birds that eat ticks in other animals' fur - and the animals just let them. Humans could either provide some service to certain monsters, or could domesticate or semi-domesticate monsters into acting as "guard dogs". The neighbours have nicer stuff Humans don't need to make their settlements impenetrable - they just have to make sure there's easier pickings elsewhere. For example, if monsters have to walk through a forest full of wild sheep and hogs to reach the humans, and the humans will put up a fight, they'd just eat the sheep and hogs. Starving the monsters of some resource You could make the monsters need some Whatever to recharge their mutant power crystals, or whatever. Humans could have used their superior intelligence to figure this out and wreck up all the Whatever sources near their city. Now the monsters don't come around much for the same reason humans don't walk around deserts much. 

After reading The Ellimist Chronicles by K.A. Applegate, I wondered what conditions would have led to the environment found on the planet "Ket" featured in the story. Ket has the following properties: 

Within software environments there is a variety of malware such as viruses, trojans, bots and so forth. This malware is created by human programmers to accomplish specific purposes (e.g. steal personal information, pointless terrorism, etc). However, given the right circumstances, is it not possible that analogues of biological ecosystems might arise which use self-replicating computer code in lieu of biological molecules? 

What you seem to want is a species whose culture is devoid of prejudice, but your proposed solution of removing all differences is impractical. If every member of the species is indistinguishable, then that would imply they have little to no genetic diversity and this is undesirable if the species is to survive for a long period of time. Furthermore, prejudice may be based on socioeconomic factors and differences of opinion. Addressing this would require removing individuality, which isn't impossible but means their psychology would be fundamentally alien to our own. I propose a few alternative solutions. No individuality The species as a whole lacks any kind of individuality: they all think and act as one. Since they cannot have differences of opinion, prejudice is impossible (anymore than our brains may be prejudiced against our limbs and internal organs). An explanation for this that most readily comes to mind is that the species is eusocial, like some kinds of insects. The species is divided into castes that perform different but equally vital roles, such as labor, combat, reproduction and complex thought. An example of this are the various "bug" civilizations in science fiction, such as Pseudo-arachnids in Starship Troopers, Formics in Ender's Game, and Tyranids in Warhammer 40,000. Empathy communication The species communicates by exchanging thoughts, feelings and memories directly rather than through imperfect intermediaries like writing and speech. This overcomes one of the vital enablers of prejudice: lack of empathy. Since this method of communication is so efficient, compromise is much easier to achieve and prejudice has difficulty taking hold. Any prejudices that survive will probably be held by the entire species and then only because they all agreed it is necessary. Depending of the degree of exchange they might not develop individuality or consciousness in the way humans understand it. At the extreme end they might consider their physical bodies expendable so long as most of their knowledge and memories are preserved elsewhere. An example of such a species would be the "Super Happy People" in the web novella Three Worlds Collide. Eugenics and brainwashing This is probably the exact thing you didn't want, but one possibility is that the species practices an extreme form of eugenics. Long ago most differences in appearance and opinion were wiped out (perhaps by natural disaster, perhaps by war), then the survivors used genetic engineering and brainwashing to create a truly homogeneous society. An example of such a society would be the Fords in Brave New World, the Borg in Star Trek, and the cenobites in Hellraiser. 

The truth is in reality we could have an all-robot war tomorrow - ICBMs and cruise missiles fit almost every definition of a robot. Of course, although in such a war it would be robots carrying all the weapons, huge numbers of humans would die as well as the robots being destroyed. In the book "Arms and Influence", Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling advances the view that there are two things a military can do to accomplish a country's goals in a conflict: 

Needless to say, coercion is a lot less heroic, and politicians are much less likely to advocate for it in clear, open language. But the truth is in many situations it's easier, cheaper and more effective. I can make direct force difficult by having my missile factories hidden and fortified - or maybe instead of launching missiles I'm doing something harder to police, like funding rebel groups within your country. Given humans' natural appetite for revenge, some would argue that every war that ends without annihilation or permanent occupation has had an element of coercion. Anyway, here's my point: Coercion requires pain or the threat thereof, and a drone-vs-drone battle doesn't have any pain (except the opportunity cost of that-drone-cost-money-that-could-have-been-spent-elsewhere) - so both sides will be looking to get around the other side's drones, so they can land attacks that actually hurt the other guy. So even if both sides have 100% drone militaries, it's drone-vs-civilian strikes that are actually going to bring the war to a conclusion. 

This hypothetical sapient species utterly lacks sexual dimorphism, such as due to being synchronous hermaphrodites (male and female at the same time), sequential hermaphrodites (change sex depending on circumstances) or isogamous (similar to hermaphrodites, but gametes are not segregated into ovum and sperm). How could the species develop anything resembling our concepts of patriarchy, gender roles, homophobia, etc? 

It is a common assertion that an irresistible force and an immovable object cannot exist in the same universe at the same time without ceasing to be irresistible or immovable. However, is not an irresistible force and an immovable object logically the same thing? An immovable object cannot be changed from its current course, but if it is moving on its own then it would be an irresistible force to anything in its path. An irresistible force, if stationary, could not be moved from its position and would be an immovable object to anything trying to move it. Therefore, if either an irresistible force or immovable object existed, then both would exist since they are one and the same. Since neither may coexist with the other, then neither can exist at all. Thus, an unsolvable paradox. Is my logic sound? If so, what kind of physical laws (or absence thereof) would be required to allow such paradoxes to exist? 

For day-to-day home use, a lot of the power of modern computers is spent on making things look nice and providing abstractions that cut software development costs. You and I could exchange this message just as well over teleprinters. So things like banks and electronic payment networks could survive; the terminals used in shops would get simpler, and banks could maintain their centralised systems for a long time by making their software more efficient and buying up old computers on ebay (where they would presumably become a valuable commodity) There would be a few years of great business for companies that sell prints of your digital photographs, sell physical maps, and things like that. I suspect people might retain something similar to personal computers, as for a lot of stuff having people do things online is more efficient than mail or phone. That might take the form of a shift to 'dumb terminals' with time-sharing access to 'mainframes' although they might be re-named to 'cloud desktops' or something. As the vintage, high-performance equipment got older resources would get more constrained, as the chips we were able to make would cost more per unit performance. We might not be able to use all the bandwidth of high-bandwidth undersea cables. I suspect that would lead us to a more austere, hierarchical replacement for the internet. No more videos or photos posted to social media by hurricane survivors - perhaps only major news organisations would have access to that much bandwidth. There would be political and business implications for this stuff, of course - expensive bandwidth would increase the power of the press and those who own/control them; and a move towards mainframes would make snooping and industrial espionage easier. 

This hypothetical marsupial species raises young in a manner loosely similar to seahorses. Only the males have pouches: after gestation the female deposits the fetus into his pouch to compete development. Is this adaptation competitive? EDIT: Here are some revisions to address problems brought up by answers: 

I am trying to figure out the sex-determination of a very foreign form of reproduction. A species has three sexes X, Y, and Z. X produces X gametes, Y produces Y gametes, Z produces Z gametes. They do not correspond to male or female, as any may impregnate or be impregnated. Only two parents of different sexes are needed to reproduce, because the only possible combinations of gamete fusion are X and Y, or X and Z, or Y and Z. The offspring may be any sex, including the one that neither of their parents are. Sex is determined genetically, not by environmental factors. How does the zygote determine whether to be X, Y or Z?
