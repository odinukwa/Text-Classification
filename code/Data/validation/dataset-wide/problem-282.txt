This answer doesn't handle how to separate the population, but discusses how much separation is required. I decided to do a small simulation of two such populations to give you an idea of the amount of interbreeding that is possible to retain the two populations. I assumed there were two populations, both of which were city sized (they mixed together within their city perfectly, everyone may end up having children with anyone else). Then I assumed that a small percentage (alpha) from city A moved to city B each generation, and the same percentage of B moved to A. Then each generation produced a new generation with the ethnicity distribution that the new generation which had an ethnicity ratio was proportional to the number of individual pairs that could lead to them. For example, assume cross-over was 1 percent and we are simulating the first generation. The original generation from city A has 1% individuals that are purely from B, and 99% that are purely from A. Therefore generation 2 would have 0.01% from B, 0.99% that are 50/50, and 99% that are from A. Then 1% of this distribution would swap with 1% of the opposite from the group at B and it would be repeated. I ran this for 1000 generations, with 1025 different ratios available (i.e. a person could be 1/1025 from A and 1024/1025 from B). Here are the results (I apologize for the small font): 

The top left is when there is no mixing. You can't see anything because the populations stay pure. The top right is when mixing is 1%. The green line is population of A, with the right side of the graph begin purely A, and the blue line is population of B, with the left side being purely B. It is on log scale, so the spikes mean than approximately 1% of each population is 50/50, 1% is 75/25(favoring the native ethnicity), 1% is 87.5/12.5 and so on. A cross-over of 2% in the middle left graph shows similar trends, with 2% of the population at 50/50 and so on. At >3% cross over though, the populations become unstable and converge to both being about 50/50 for all individuals. Therefore while you may have many ways to seperate the populations, you want to make certain that the population transfer per generation is only on the order of a percent or two. 

My first thought with this is thanks to the sheer size of it, you would need to section its government into individual areas defined by something, whether it be culture, language, or physical space. You're definitely going to run into issues with communication, as the city's sheer scale would require several types of communication technology just to function. This would also bring up a number of problems in actually governing this society, as the farther the distance is, the harder it is to communicate effectively. Your Light Year City would need a fast way to transmit information, so let's go with a theoretical example based on the the experiment here. These scientists managed to produce fibers that can theoretically transfer 10 terabytes a second at 29,889,308,062.6 meters/second, based on the paper they wrote. Thus, it'd take slightly over a year to transfer data through fiber-optic cables based on the speed of light. Thus, we'd probably be best served by using a combination of technologies. For short to medium distances of a few light-seconds [282 miles] to a several thousands or tens of thousands of light-seconds, the fiber optic cables would be . Anything much longer would have longer times You'd want something short-range for personal communication within a few miles, such as radio. Towers would need to be spaced every 400-800 meters, as stated on Wikipedia. It would probably be best to divide the city into sections, and then into smaller and smaller subdivisions until you reach a minimum size unit, similar to the county system used in the US. These would need local mayors to govern a few counties, and each larger group of areas would need another governor. They would most likely report to the ruler (or rulers) of the entire city. If you're using modern technology, this would by necessity be a very infrequent event, but if you aren't, then you might be able to use more advanced techniques like quantum entanglement to transmit data faster. One possible way to bypass some of the bureaucracy issues is to let automated systems handle some aspects of governing and law, like cameras that cite people for speeding in whatever vehicles they use or management computers that give orders to workers to direct them to systems needing maintainence. The last issue I'll handle with this question is transportation. Hovercars and such would help, and magnetic levitation vehicles could move your citizens hundreds of miles reasonably quickly, but as the distances get longer, your transportation would need to go faster. The supersonic passenger jets like the Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144 weren't as necessary here on Earth, but fast transport like these would would be invaluable in a city on the scale you propose. Rockets like the SABRE rocket engine would be one way to help get a bit farther, but the city's citizens would require much faster engines to get anywhere within the span of a human lifetime.
