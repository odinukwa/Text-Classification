I suspect, along with everything else, that SS cables produce less friction than galvanized. And for the price difference it's pretty silly to use anything but SS. 

50 miles (in decent weather, on reasonably flat terrain) is really not that far, if you break it into 10-15 mile segments and stop to rest a few minutes between. If you can comfortably do 10-15 miles in one "sitting" then you should have no real difficulties (other than being fairly sore the next day). I'd recommend doing a couple of 10-25 mile rides in the week leading up, but taking it easy the day (or two) before the ride. And make sure your bike is "tuned up", with the shifters and brakes working well, and the tires properly inflated. Go a little heavy on starchy food the evening before, eat a decent (not too fatty) breakfast, and be sure to get some snacks every hour or so. And drink plenty of water. If it's a hot day, be sure to get some extra salt in the form of salty snacks, eg. 

You should be able to estimate the tooth capacity of a rear derailer by installing it on a bike, threading a chain through (and over a cluster), anchoring one end of the chain so it can't move, and pulling on the other end. You'd first pull just enough to achieve "minimum" tension, then pull until the derailer was stretched close to tight. Count the chain links that are pulled past a fixed spot (ie, don't just count how many links roll off the jockey wheel) as you pull between these two positions. You'd probably want to try this 2-3 times on different cogs of the cluster. Definitely takes a bit of judgment, but should come within 1-2 teeth of the "right" answer. 

Generally speaking, in the US, in light to moderate traffic, and where there are no bike lanes or other provisions for bikes: 

In any event, for that much weight on a road bike 60psi is the minimum you should be running -- I run 90-100 on my 700C-35s. You should get Kevlar-belted tires -- much more puncture resistant -- and get tires that are rated to run at least 80psi. And I'm wondering if 35s aren't a hair wide for 19 rims -- that may be contributing to snakebite punctures. 

Well, obviously a lot depends on how far you travel and what the roads are like -- long distances over smooth suburban highways you want a bit narrower tire than for shorter distances or rougher, more urban streets. But generally there's no point in going narrower than about 28 -- the savings in rolling/wind resistance would only be of interest to a racer -- and likely there'd be little advantage in going below 35 or so, if the route is at all rough. Just be sure to keep your tire pressure up in the 80-100 range, near the top of the sidewall rating (something that also is important to prevent snakebite punctures). What you definitely DO want is Kevlar-belted tires. The puncture resistance of Kevlar tires is 5-10 times greater than standard tires, especially in the narrower, lighter sizes. My current tires (35mm Kevlar-belted touring tires) have 3000-5000 miles on them and have never had a puncture. 

In general, you only need to replace the front rings when they give you problems, either with skipping, chain suck, or shifting problems. Running with a worn front will not add appreciably to the wear of other components. But a well-equipped bike shop should have a gauge for checking the rings. 

I've been on week-long rides with Type 1 diabetics, though I've never had a chance to query them on their practices. But my (non-cycling) wife is Type 1 (50 years) so I'm familiar with the issues. First off, you should have a Medic Alert bracelet or neck chain, of course. After that, you should probably carry a glucagon injector for serious hypoglycemic episodes. And look into continuous blood glucose monitors -- they're still imperfect but are getting better. (My wife credits hers with allowing her to lose about 10 pounds.) Beyond that, probably it's "know your body" more than anything else. You should keep a journal of ride info -- what you ate before & during the ride, glucose at start/middle/end, how much insulin you took, etc. Also record, of course, time, distance, wind/hills, etc. Try to learn whatever signals you're body is giving you when glucose is dropping on a ride -- there likely are clues if you look for them. PS: If my conversions are right you're about 6'1" and weigh about 193. This is maybe just a hair on the high side of the "recommended" range. It's probably more important for you to develop a healthy(er) lifestyle than to focus on any particular target weight. 

From your description the brake cable (or the rear caliper) may be rusted up. (Although, if you "got the brakes replaced" whoever did that should have checked brake operation and lubed the cable and caliper if necessary.) Observe the rear caliper as you squeeze the handle -- gentle motion on the handle should result in smooth closing of the caliper, and you shouldn't feel any significant resistance in the brake lever until the caliper is closed against the rim. Do note that there's a lot of stretch in the rear brake cable (because it's so much longer than the front), so once the caliper is closed against the rim the cable will continue to stretch as you squeeze. 

The considerations here don't really vary that much between a 2-lane road and a 4-lane road, other than the 4-lane road makes it more practical to "claim your lane". But on a 4-lane road you need to be conscious of whether it's a thoroughfare where vehicle lane position is not a major concern for drivers, vs a city street where jockeying for lane position is a significant concern. 

I have seen fully-loaded tourists ride successfully with lightweight racing bikes (of years ago) on what were then called 7/8" tires (which is 22.2mm). I've also seen them lay their bikes down in the parking lot at lunch and have the tires explode. (Don't ask me what mechanism was involved, but it happened at least 3 times in a week among a group of maybe 20 on the lightweight bikes, among a larger group of about 200.) As a commuter/tourist I favor wider tires (I currently ride 35s), for the slightly smoother ride, better handling on rough pavement, less frequent airing up, and better weight-carrying ability. But the main question in your case is whether the tires can simply carry the weight, at full pressure, without compressing too much. Load up your bike (with dummy weights if necessary), sit on it (or have a friend of the same weight do so), and see how the tires look. 

Scraping/tearing, when the bike falls down, is laid down, or lays against, say, a brick wall. Twisting/sliding from the pressure of your hands. 

On older bikes the sprocket cluster and ratchet mechanism are combined, whereas on newer bikes the hub and ratchet mechanism are combined. As with "clipless pedals", the terminology is not chosen to actually make things clear, but simply to avoid reusing terms that were previously used in a different sense. So cluster+ratchet = "freewheel", leaving only the hub, while ratchet+hub = "freehub", leaving the cluster = "cassette". 

If you were going longer I'd suspect dehydration, but no way you can get dehydrated in eight miles unless the temp and humidity are both in the 90s. It's vaguely possible you're OVER-hydrating, but more likely your riding position is too awkward -- perhaps reaching forward too much (given your waist circumference & general condition), or perhaps you're seat's too low. Find some sites on the web about bike fit and make sure your bike is reasonably sized and reasonably well-adjusted. Raise your handlebar a bit higher, if it's not already at the warning mark. There are some medical conditions that can be "revealed" from more intense cycling, but not likely at the level you're doing. Added: One other possibility is cycling in too "high" a gear (on a multi-speed bike). This places unnecessary strain on the entire body, especially the knees, but also the leg and lower torso muscles. Generally (on the flat) one should adjust gearing so as to pedal at a rate above 60 RPM (ie, one complete revolution of the pedals per second), and experienced cyclists will tend to pedal at 70-90 RPM (for some reason getting slower as we age). Another way to gauge pedaling speed (that works pretty well across a range of effort levels) is that you should do at least one revolution of the pedal for each breath you take, and preferably two revolutions per breath. It's OK to slow RPMs somewhat on a hill, but don't go so slow that you're "grinding". The two most common mistakes made by new cyclists are to have the seat too low and to pedal too slowly.

The two major "drags" on a bike, on level ground, are the rolling resistance of the tires and the wind resistance of the bike and rider. In general, up to a point, a tire with higher pressure will have lower rolling resistance, as will a tire with a smoother tread. Tire width also figures in, but mostly in terms of how it influences pressure and tread. Wind resistance is affected by tire width, number of spokes, tube size, and rider position. Generally, as the "raciness" of a bike increases, tire width and spoke count decrease and rider position becomes more prone (and hence more aerodynamic). Tube size doesn't tend to vary much (and may actually increase as you go steel->aluminum->carbon) but that effect is slight and subtle differences in frame design can be more significant. There may also be ergonomic changes -- eg, the more prone riding position, while more fatiguing, is often somewhat better for peak power output. Bearing quality hardly figures in at all. Even cheapo bearings have very low losses, and the difference in drag between them and top-of-the-line bearings is not likely to be measurable. (The bigger difference is in durability.) Bike weight only comes into the equation when one must "climb" (and to a very minor degree for rolling resistance), but of course it's rare to have a route that does not go up/down by 0.5% or so most of the time. That 0.5% increases the power required to hold a steady speed by about 10% over a dead-level course. But the 3KG difference between the above two bikes would amount to about a 0.4% power difference on that 0.5% slope. 

Everyone's different. You don't give a hint as to what your body weight or BMI is, so we don't know if you're overweight or anorexic or "just right". Do note that, in some people, intense exercise can cause you to "lose interest" in eating for a period of time, but usually after about 2 months this effect abates and your appetite returns. Unless you feel that you have "issues" with your weight and appetite (eg, a tendency towards anorexia nervosa) you should just let your body decide what it wants to weigh. And simply eat a balanced, varied diet, with moderate amounts of fat and high-quality protein. Stay away from most "supplements", and don't be misled into believing that you need a "high protein diet" or something else super-special.
