Deleuze & Guattari introduce the idea of the rhizome in their text A thousand Plateaus as a metaphor closer to the reality than aboroscent (tree-like) descriptions can. The question is how does one theorise rhizomatically? Given that Deleuze concepts form a closely linked set of ideas with singularity, virtuality & multiplicity, must all of these ideas be brought to in to apply the concept of a Rhizome? Is the evolution of language a good example to theorise with - after all it is traditionally described by a tree? Can one, for example, suggest the existence of a tap-root was actually forced onto linguists by their chosen mode of description - a tree - whereas a rhizomatic description does away with a point-like origin. We also have a picture of say the Indo-European language family starting of at some distant tap-root and slowly diversifying and splitting into many languages, with each branch then developing in perpetual isolation. In this picture, one cannot visualise creolisation where two languages at one time far apart is put into sudden contact and either one perishes, or a new hybrid (creole) develops. Or two languages that were in close contact and actually mutually intelligible, by some force are closed off from each other, and so developing independently eventually become mutually unintelligible. Can one say then that the Rhizome is arguably closer ontologically to the reality of language than the traditional linguists image of thought/language - the tree? Has this formulation been used in the (non-Wittgenstein and/or non-analytical) philosophy of language/linguistics at all? If it has, by whom - and what has been the reception? 

I'd question this assumption; suppose I'm a writer and I am faced with a blank page, I can choose to write whatever I want, in whatever script I want or just doodle over it. All of these acts possess meaning to the extent that thought has gone into it. Analogously, it doesn't follow that being able to make any change to reality, renders reality into a meaningless category. 

That flourishing suggests plant life and organic growth is deliberate as she opens her discourse with a quotation from the Greek lyric poet - Pindar: 

Did Heraclitus say this? and given its likely that Holderlin paraphrased for dramatic effect, what is the closest verified saying (or sayings, if Holderlin synthesised them) of Heraclitus to this? Although its not a part of this question, its worth pointing out that Holderlin idealised Greece, and one can discern the same thought, or an aspect of it in the Tao. 

This is one way of intuitively understanding the infinitesimal and infinite. It can be made rigourous in non-standard analysis or in Conways surreal numbers. This is very different from the mainstream way of understanding the infinitesimal which is via limits. A fourth way of understanding the infinitesimal is synthetically as the square root of zero. This of course is surprising as normally we would say standardly that the square root of zero is just zero. However the theory uses intuitionistic rather than classical logic and hence opens up a space for the introduction of infinitesimals. Its arguably closest to the notion of infinitesimals of Newton. Philosophically speaking it is a way of rigourously formulating Hegels insight (to Zenos paradox) that an infinitesimal is something that is both here and not here. 

These are geneally seen to be on opposing sides. Arguing from axiomatic is arguing from first principles which have clear and distinct conceptualisation in the minds eye of the arguer. Whereas arguing from authority is simply an argument from a higher authority than oneself, or a recognised authority by the at least the arguer, and in the best cases by the arguee too, (and in the worst cases entirely unacceptable to him). But surely to argue from axiomatics, is to also argue for the authority of that particular axiomatisation, as opposed to some other; or to argue for an axiomatisation, when a non-axiomatisation might be safer, as the issue under dispute, when reflected on, shows no inclination to be harboured by such geometrically orientated thought; or to argue for the sociological support - ie by a majority of the cognoscenti - who accepts that axiomatisation in the pursuit of that strand or thread of thought? 

Recall the asymmetry of power here: you are the master & he is the slave. You have power over him; be mindful of him - if not charitable; the equivalent in Kantian terms is when you treat a man as an end (slave, servant or other hired help) then do not treat them as a mere end; but recall that they too, are men, with souls (psyche) as your own. edit Some additional context supporting the above interpretation follows the quoted text; for Epictetus goes on to write: 

What this means is for each x in all of D there is a y such that R(x,y) holds Because x is bound first, we must first consider x ranging over D, ie over {1,2,3} Thus we consider the three substitutions: 

Individually this is difficult to determine, but in the large ie taking the wider view, a wave of disclosures reveals a systemic failure; and as these are acts of men rather than of a god, then an ethical failure. 

Until you are forced by force of circumstance or by an other to make a choice. We can't live, in actual fact, many and multiple lives - though we can vicariously - through novels, films and narratives; and life presents us with situations where choices are to be made, paths to be taken and retaken. To avoid making a choice, is to avoid authenticity; and far from being a choice in a positive sense; sometimes though ones choices are constrained by circumstance, and one is positively choosing to not to choose: to take a petty example, if one is asked what is your favourite colour - the actual form of the question suggests that there can be one; I might suggest that they have a suspect relationship to colour. 

Russell's paradox was resolved by changing the foundational concepts in Set Theory; an alternative resolution uses paraconsistent logic. Similarly theodicies resolve the problem of good and evil by resolving these concepts: for example, in Simone Weils concept of theology, evil is due to Gods absence in the world, and who is placed at an infinite distance from the world with an infinitesimal residue - grace; another is this paper which takes propositions to be thoughts, and use Lewis's possible worlds. Given that the set of people who are knowledgeable about paraconsistent logic, theology and are interested in the problem of evil - there's unlikely to be much work on this, at least I'm unaware of it. 

Logic and mathematics are distinct subjects; its only relatively recently that logicians began to be excited about the possibility that mathematics coud be reduced to logic - this began with the work of Frege, Russell & Wittgenstein amongst many others during the late 19C and early 20C. The excitement is driven by the philosophical thinking that logic is somehow a more fundamental topic than mathematics; and any reduction in fundamental notions will be valuable - in the usual sense, that is Occams Razor - but also in many unforseen ways too. 

Generally, or at least in my experience, 'to be' is introduced as a verb. But is it? It doesn't appear to describe a change as in 'I kicked a ball' or 'he picked the pen up'. It describes things as they are as in 'this ball is blue', and how they will or might be without being specific how that state will be reached: 'this ball will be blue' or 'this ball might be blue'. But it does describe the whole state, but a quality of it; which is consonant with its adjectival description: 'the blue ball'; but notably this is without tense. We could, though say 'bluish'; so speculatively we could posit an adjective, derived from blue, and when used signifies 'not blue now but will be blue in the future'. This suggests that 'is' is a linguistic element that says that a particular quality subsists in some object; in essence then, it describes states and not actions. Is this right? 

Nagarjuna, a buddhist philsopher around 200 AD, in India, wrote on the impossibility of motion in the context of justifying Buddhist ontology (lack of svabhava); this is the content of the second section of his Madhymakarika (Verses on the Middle Way); Westerhoff, in his translation writes: 

Sure; if one is a third-party and have no involvement in the situation. However if one is called to judge the situation, or to act as counsel for one side or the other a position must be taken; as counsel you're assigned a side and must develop the best arguments for defence or plaintiff which will mean exploiting the weaknesses of the other side; as a judge, one is called to judge, to give a decision, one cannot then sit on the fence. 

Call the world as it presents itself to us world-1 The regularity & order in the world demands explanation - hence we have a mathematically consistent description of the world. Call this world-2. But surely the same situation again applies here: that the regularity & order is manifestly displayed in world-2 demands an explanation. Suppose that this is another mathematically consistent explanation for this. Call this world-3. and so on. We appear to have an infinite regress. Does this mean that any mathematical description of the world can never be complete in itself? A rough example of this is the description of our own universe in the standard model. Then the explanation of fine-tuning demands explanation - some treatments consider then the perspective of a larger multiverse. 

Both Arendts Totalitarianism and Eichman in Jerusalem where she examines the nature of Stalins Soviet Union & The Nazi Regime, and also the trial of Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal in Jerusalem; the second book is where she coined the phrase 'banality of evil'. Arendt, was famously a lover of Heidegger; she was also Jewish but highly secularised. Mary Midgeleys Wickedness:a philosophical essay is by a Christian philosopher, but in this essay, as this review acknowledges distances the topic of 'evil' from her theological concerns; hence, of course, wickedness rather than evil. To quote from the review: 

Evolution as described by science lacks direction, or rather it has a direction, but the direction is not conciously plotted. An ancestor of a giraffe did not decide conciously to elongate its neck several millenia later. That evolution may have a final cause may be tied up with the final cause of the universe, in fact it is neccesarily so. That final causes cannot be discovered by science as done by us is obvious. As science is blind to final causes its theories must neccesarily be so too. Thus evolution has no final cause is merely the reflection of the same bias in the methodology of science. 

Theres been a lot of ferocious critique from set theoreticians perhaps generating more heat than light as they see categorical foundations as intruding on their own turf. Most philosophers interested in foundations are schooled in foundations in ZFC style. Category Theory hasn't made much inroads here - but this will probably change in the future as the importance of Category Theory as a structuring device in mathematics has only become more pronounced, and as more philosophers are schooled in Category Theory. Whilst ZFC is generally taught in the first year of an undergraduate course, one only gains appreciation of the categorical view after a substantial amount of sophisticated mathematics has been absorbed, say by the end of a 1st year graduate course. Lawvere certainly has done a great deal of good work in categorical foundations but the key concept is that of a Topos which is a generalised Set Theory, which have an implicit logic tied to it (via its internal language which is usually some form of type theory) and geometric interpretation (via sheaves). An important observation is that the logic is not Boolean but intuitionistic, that the Axiom of Choice is not always upheld and that they do not necessarily have an infinite object. When these are asserted then of course we have a much more set-like topos. Of course there is a huge zoo of toposes rather than the unique ZFC that one supposes one has. The n-lab a repository of category-theoretical work by higher dimensional category theorists have a reference on Foundations. One would suppose that the philosophical school known as Structuralism would have a great deal to say about Category Theory as Structure is a notion that pervades both fields. But Structuralism is associated more with architecture, , linguistics (its originary home), literary studies and anthropology than it is with the mathematics, so the essential overlap between the two fields is actually zero. Whereas ZFC is the endgame of reductionalism in mathematics - reducing all mathematics to sets, and then sets to logic+axioms; Category Theory takes each mathematical activity to have its on natural home, its own place - instead of a sharply hierarchical view it looks towards a more expansive relational, intrinsic and natural view - it is not Descartian. The paper you refer to is mathematics proper rather than philosophy - the structural similarity of certain arguments in the paradoxes that Lawvere re-examines had been already noted and just generally referred to as a diagonal argument in honour of Cantors first use of this kind of argument to show that the continuum had a larger cardinality than the integers. After the invention of Category theory by Maclane it was possible to place these arguments in a host of different contexts in a systematic format. The use of closed cartesian categories is probably a red herring too - essentially these are categories in which the notion of an exponential naturally occurs and satisfies the usual laws. Given how prevalent the exponential in ordinary mathematics it would seem 'obvious' that the same notion would be just as useful in more general contexts where mathematics are done such as the category of groups or of rings etc. This has proved to be the case. From there its just one step to investigate the what kind of beast is a cartesian closed category. Its not really, I think, a foundational issue.
