Choose the right seat position - Citi Bike is all about convenient, quick rides. Save time by choosing a bike that's pre-adjusted for you (you'll be able to eye the right seat height after just a couple rides). And don't pick a bike if its seat is twisted around backwards. That's a sign that a previous rider found the bike busted. Check tires for air - The official pre-ride check tells Citi Bike riders to spin wheels and check tires for cuts and bulges. No doubt a few rare riders will jump on bikes with noticeably misaligned wheels and burst tires, but that hasn't happened to me. And if one day it does, then I'll just drop off that broken, but still kind of ridable bike at the nearest station (twist the seat) and pick up a new one. The official guidelines are overkill. More important than the precise condition of the tires & wheels is that you choose a bike that's pumped up with sufficient air. A quick tire squeeze will do. This is without a doubt the most important thing you can do before undocking a Citi Bike. Check pedals for damage - I've come across a few Citi Bikes that have sustained torn pedal treads. Sometimes these treads flop of fly, causing a minor inconvenience. But if a pedal tread is damaged in just the right way, who knows, maybe it could get caught in your chain and ruin your week. Don't pick the bike with that perfect storm of a torn pedal tread -- or any Citi Bike with noticeably damaged pedals. Check handlebars & seat for scum - Citi Bikes are public bikes. This is New York City. Give your seat and handlebars a quick once-over before you go for a ride. 

Follow these rules and you'll give yourself a pretty good chance of finding one of the Citi Bikes at the station that's not "a piece of shit." Follow the official pre-ride guidelines or a list that's a page long, and you're probably defeating the purpose of these heavy, comfy, sticky and slow public bikes: convenience. 

I was talking to a bike messenger the other day, and he said something that surprised me: If you see a car door swing open in front of you and you can't avoid it, pull your hands off the handlebars and take the full impact. He said you won't lose any fingers this way. Is this true? Is there a safer way to collide with a door? 

There are some good answers here, but none describes a pre-ride check that is both quick and covers the main problem points encountered with Citi Bikes. These cruisers are special. They are extremely heavy, they can only be ridden in short spurts, there is nearly always a dock within a 10-minute walk, and the bikes are used and abused by riders and passersby that don't give a snot about them. As I've come to discover, there's a special way to give these special bikes a once-over. 

I'm having trouble finding up-to-date information on the growth of cycling in the US and across the globe. How rapidly is the cycling industry growing? In what country is cycling growing fastest? Is the industry growing in lock-step with new cyclists or are established cyclists just purchasing more cycling goods? Where are the most new cyclists hopping on bicycles? Many questions, I know, and don't expect them all answered. More broadly: Where can I find, or can anyone provide, statistics that demonstrate the trajectory of bike use? 

I have never ridden a century ride before. This June, a friend and I plan to ride our first: The Montauk Century Ride. But I'm wondering, why should we commit to paying $100+ to ride this route in relatively heavy bike traffic, from a starting point not chosen by us, on a day that could be rainy for all we know? Why not ride the route on a day chosen by us? It seems to me riding on our own might provide a more convenient experience and more meaningful challenge. What am I missing here? 

I recently had an inner tube on my mountain bike changed, but it was my wife that actually took the bike in to the shop for service. When it came back I noticed the stem has a blue cap rather than the typical black cap. I have seen slime inner tubes that have a green cap, so it got me to wondering if there was something different about the tire. Although I hadn't asked for slime and she didn't remember anything being said about it, it's possible they could have just thrown it in as a freebie. (This sort of thing has happened before where they quote one price over the phone and then the actual price winds up being less than what they quoted.) I have also noticed that at one point the tire went flat uncharacteristically fast (within a couple days of non-use compared to normal losses of a maximum of 1/3 pressure over a week), but after I pumped it back up it seemed to hold its pressure fairly well over a longer time period, which suggests to me that either there was a tiny leak which somehow sealed itself when the tube was re-pressurized, or slime was involved. Aside from actually taking off the tire and taking out the tube and shaking it, how can I tell if a given tire has slime in it? 

I tend to spin rather slow when I am riding. 50rpm is a comfortable rate for me to spin for as long as I want to ride. 90rpm seems to be the rate at which I expend maximum power... I can't spin this longer than about 2 1/2 minutes on a -2% (downhill) grade, but going uphill I can sprint at least 15 seconds on a +12% grade starting at 90rpm (corresponding to close to 30mph), before I start to slow down appreciably, and correspondingly I have found that I perform much better on hills due to the lower cadences required. Now my concern is higher cadences are generally recommended (I especially see this when people are asking about higher gear ratios to go faster), and I have been told that 50rpm is way too low for a cruising cadence. But if I do something like interval training to increase my cadence I am concerned that this will affect my climbing strength. Is this something I should worry about, or is there a specific approach that can result in me being able to tolerate higher cadences, without losing power at the low end? 

Depending on where you live, wind can be highly unpredictable and fickle. I use Google weather (google for "wind speed" and then click on "wind"; n.b. this apparently won't work in some mobile browsers) to get a rough idea of what the winds are going to be like for the day. However, I have found that even this can be horribly inaccurate if you ride any place hilly. In my experience the wind direction can shift 90 degrees between valleys and the ridges, and can even turn 180 degrees along the course of the ride, meaning I start with a nice tail wind, and then half way through the ride I run into a head wind. Since you are commuting, I wouldn't count on a head wind in one direction to imply a tail wind in the other. This will depend a lot on where you are, but in my experience it is often not true. When I ride I tend to look for flags along the way to determine the direction and rough speed of the wind. This allows me to gauge roughly what the wind is like, and if you want to you can make a note of these along the way and write them down in a log when you get a chance. The downside I have found with this is that often I will start depending on a flag in a particular place and then suddenly it will get taken down. An anemometer mounted on the bike has been mentioned, but one issue with this is that it doesn't consider your riding profile. If you are riding in an aero position and then switch to standing to climb a hill, even with the same wind speed and direction you will encounter different wind forces. I don't think subtracting off your speed would be a big deal, but you would need some kind of sensor to try to determine where you were sitting, standing, hunched over, etc. and this could be tricky and error prone or at the least tedious. Since you are using Strava, one thing you can do to try to factor out the wind in determining your fitness and performance level is to take advantage of Strava segments. Break your ride down into smaller pieces, using your knowledge of having ridden the route before to decide what the optimal segments are. This may already be done for you in places. If you are concerned about having lots of segments you can make them private so it only compares your performance to yourself. Then, the idea is to concentrate your efforts on the segment(s) that have the most favorable wind for the day. You won't be able to compare your entire route every day, but depending on conditions you might not want to push yourself hard every single day anyway. 

As far as the numbers on the box go, you can be slightly out of the tube's range. There is no such thing as a 23 mm tube. There are tubes which include 23 mm in their range. Your existing tubes in your 25 mm tires could already extend over the 23 mm range. Suppose your existing tubes are "22-25". Then, the 23 mm tires are in the middle of that range. Or suppose your tubes are 25-28. Then the 23 mm size is a bit out of range: it's okay to re-use the tubes if they pass the above avoid guidelines. 

It's not clear what is actually bent. From your picture, it is obvious what isn't bent: your fork is perfectly straight from the crown down to the drop outs. Also, the boot which covers the stanchion seems to be quite suggestively aligned with the fork; the bend seems to occur at the top of the boot, just before the head tube. If so, then it is in fact the shock's stanchion which is bent. That part may actually be a steel tube that inserts into the fork's crown. It would help to have a picture with the boot retracted or removed. Here is what I mean, visually: 

The "game changes" at this point. Of course the dirt works its way around the pin as the linkage rotates, and passes through sections of the drive cycle where it is not under load. 

I'm not exactly sure how that Revoshift works and I will likely never get a chance to get my hands on such a low-end thing to take it apart. The trigger-type shifters with a needle display have an internal spring which forces the indicator needle to go to the 1 even if the cable tension is completely slack. If that spring breaks, then they will not go to 1. Perhaps your barrel shifter works similarly. It is not unusual for the cable tension to be completely slack on the lowest front ring. That is simply because the index position is farther than necessary; the actual movement of the derailleur is trimmed with the "L" screw. You can see this clearly in the assymetry of the typical shifter display, which looks a little like this: 

Your 26" tires sit on wheel rims, whose diameter is probably 559 mm. 24" tires will not fit onto these rims; to use 24" "junior" tires you actually need smaller wheels, of a 507 mm diameter. These smaller wheels require a different frame. Smaller rims require a different frame mainly because hardware related to the wheel which is mounted to the larger frame is at the wrong location for the smaller wheel diameter: this hardware includes mounting bosses for rim brakes and fenders. Also, on smaller wheels, the existing pedals will have less ground clearance; you might strike the ground when pedaling through turns. (That's okay, because since for your height, you will probably benefit from shorter cranks anyway: see this crank length versus body height table on the Sugino website, according to which, a 152 cm person should consider pedal crank arms of 155-160mm.) Luckily, your Schwinn Huntington Cruiser itself comes in a girls' size with 24" wheels. If the Schwinn Huntington Cruiser is your dream bike, all you have to do is exchange the adult 26" one for the youth 24" and you're set. Though I strongly suspect you would be comfortable on the 24" version of the bike, is that really necessary? Smaller wheels will not help with balancing; that is, not with balancing the bicycle while in motion. I suspect that what you mean by balancing is that, while seated, you have trouble reaching the ground. However, this is okay; shorter people should not expect to be able to reach the ground from a bicycle seat. For that matter, taller riders on a large bike should not either. If your feet can easily reach the ground while you're seated, it means your knee is too bent at the bottom of the pedal stroke, which means your seat is too low. The proper bicycle technique is to get up out of the seat when you come to a stop and stand over the top tube, not over the seat. Then when you get moving again, get the bike in motion while briefly standing on the pedals, straddling the top tube. As soon as it is moving, get into the saddle. Your cruiser bike makes it easy to straddle the top tube because that top tube curves radically downward. This video demonstrates the techniques. Practice this starting and stopping technique until it is second nature, and you're not bothered by difficulty reaching the ground out of the seat. A useful technique not shown in the video is to come to a stop to a raised object, such as a curb, where you can plant one foot without getting out of the saddle. When you start moving again, you give a good push with that foot, and push down on the opposite pedal with the other foot. Even if you had the 24" version of the bike, you'd still want to adjust your seat so that you can barely touch the ground with extended toes out of the saddle, if at all. I am 6'1" tall and actually used a 24" bike for quite some time! I used it for daily commuting, and even did a 200 km road trip with an overnight stay. Of course, I had to get an extra long seat tube for it. And, guess what, I could barely reach the ground with my toes from the saddle! That's what it takes for a proper fit. If the seat had been any lower, pedaling would have become inefficient. The leg has to be almost fully extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke. And since the bottom of the pedal stroke is still quite a ways from the ground due to the necessary ground clearance, that means the ground is hard to reach out of the saddle, regardless of how tall you are or what size bike you're trying to fit.
