Oedipus Rex is the earliest example I can think of. The Greeks constructed their plays around what Aristotle would call the "sudden reversal," but was and is more commonly known as the "crisis." This is the part of the play where some decision by the protagonist reverses their fortunes and brings about resolution. I refer to Oedipus because the crisis of the play is the shattering of the protagonist's illusion that he has defeated his fate. At the time, "krisis" merely meant the severance of two parts of the play before and after the judgement of the protagonist. Realize, however, that Aristotle's Poetics held up Oedipus as the archetypal play and formed the basis of Western theater up until the 15th century. So if one makes a careful study of theater during that period between about 300 BCE to about mid-Shakespeare, the crisis of the play more often literally means the loss of the protagonist's illusion of power over their own life. That is likely where the linkage between the two comes, since the two concepts were, historically, not held in proximity. 

In short, no. At least not under any falsifiable definition of an organism. When biologists refer to a superorganism or an extended phenotype, they aren't referring to a form of life, but the capacity of a species to propagate themselves. Human systems fail the sniff test for life as well. Societies and organizations cannot replicate themselves by way of copying genes. Nor can they conduct respiration, or synthesize proteins. Most importantly, they are not contiguous, which is an absolutely necessary characteristic of an organism. Another argument against is that the concept you refer to is self-insulating. It doesn't open itself up to criticism. Like Freudian psychoanalysis, any refusal to believe that one is an adherent to the proposed system could be dismissed as an "unawareness" of participation. I should add that this does not mean that superorganisms do not exist, but that the sense of the word is entirely non-biologic. It is social. Unless one can make concrete parallels between the biological functioning of living systems and the mechanisms of human society (that is, they function the same without any abstraction from the physical), then it is incorrect to refer to society as a living being. 

Ethics is always a difficult one. However as far as utilitarianism goes then, under the assumption the product makes some job easier, by travelling in time Bob is providing this ease to more humans. He is, therefore, providing a greater good which supposedly surpasses that just of Alice. (Utilitarianism ignores the fact Bob does this for his own selfish means). We are, however, stuck in not knowing the effect of this playing with the past we are doing. Initially we could consider it as copying an idea from a hermit inventor and spreading what he makes to those who would never meet him. With the inclusion of time-travel this has been complicated in several different ways. 1) What effect does this have on Alice? Perhaps her first success sets her off on a journey of discovery which ends up saving millions of lives...or perhaps her first was a fluke and her next invention goes terribly wrong and explodes, demolishing the building she was working in. The point is we cannot predict this and so some extra element of risk is taken on by Bob. 2)Time-travel is rather a sticky subject, perhaps Bob would create a paradox which tears apart the universe (not very high up on the utilitarian to-do list). 3) If Bob is in a position to travel in time and he chooses to use this opportunity merely for personal gain he has chosen not to save many many others. He could warn Japan to evacuate Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he could warn the US of 9/11, he could do the clich√© and shoot Hitler. He could take vaccines back in time and stop the Black Death before it started. The point is that with a time-machine the utilitarian greatest good for the greatest number includes all the many people of the past. Alice is no longer a consideration, only Bob's actions are. I think perhaps the addition of time-travel detracts from your morality of stealing ideas. 

An appeal is, in basic terms, an argument of last resort. In philosophy, ideally, there is no appeal. Either the logic of your premises read out your conclusion or it does not. In a more etymological sense, an appeal is a call out for assistance from a higher power. The word comes from the the Latin appelltus, meaning to entreat. In a very basic sense, we can understand this to mean that an appeal is intended to offload the burden of proof for some argument to some external object. For instance, in the appeal to authority, the appellant (probably the wrong usage there) says, in essence, "if you can prove authority A wrong, then I am wrong." Or in an argument to pity, the appellant says, "to disprove my argument, you must reconcile it with my circumstances." So, in the wider world of rhetoric, an appeal is an argument which attempts to reverse the burden of proof by introducing a factor external to the debate, rather than relying on the logic of the premises. 

This question is one which is required by a scholastic mindset, but is by no means required. Logic is a language of constraints, and this is what makes it uniquely unable to answer questions about entities for which there are no constraints. The best we can do logically, I think, is to construct (to borrow a CS term) an escape sequence which ejects the question from consideration. There is nothing conditional about an omnipotent being. An omnipotent being, by definition, is an entity who is all capable. Any proposition on the capabilities of such a being is true. If omnipotence implies omniscience, then we must then accept that any proposition on the state of that being must also be true. If we say, "god is capable of granting free will even with perfect foreknowledge," the proposition must be true. If we say, "god has granted free will with perfect foreknowledge," then the proposition must also be true. The converse of these propositions are also true. For a being that can perform all acts and possesses all states, all propositions must be true. If all propositions are true, the propositions are unconditional. Questions must have a condition. Therefore, if there is no condition, there is no question to be had. The question is simply illogical. It does not exist. It's not the answer that is word salad, it's the question. 

Your question is too general. None of us knows you, so how are we supposed to give specific advice here? I think I might be able to give you some insights instead: The right profession for you is one that gives you joy doing it. It's the job that you don't need reasons to do because you just enjoy doing it. This joy can be derived from many things. It can be because it's your nature, or it's even already your hobby, it can be because it gives you a feeling of meaning and sense. If humanism is an important concern in your life, of course it may influence the question which jobs give you joy and which don't, and as such it will influence your choices. However, ... even the most successful entrepreneurship in a humanistic field can be wrong for you if it's only a mental choice which doesn't give you immediate joy in your heart. If it doesn't give you joy, most of all you're unlikely to excel, thus making little impact in the first place. You should consider this: As a truly happy person you contribute more to the well-being of the world than any unhappy humanistic person. Don't try to make anyone happy if you aren't happy. It's like trying to make a gift that you don't have, it will never work. You can only give what you have, and if your humanism is rooted in unhappiness, what you'll spread is unhappiness. Hence the prime concern should be your own happiness first. Don't confuse this with just satisfaction or egocentrism. Happiness is far beyond that. Then from that point you will create a certain type of wealth naturally, most likely also by doing the profession that you are doing with heart and soul. It may be as an entrepreneur, but it doesn't have to be. That wealth that you create then you can spend on humanistic purposes, or you can invest the time that you have from having created this wealth for pursuing a humanistic project. 

Emergence and reductionism aren't generally considered to be opposite concepts, though they are related and sometimes conflict. There are quite a few academics which fall into one camp or another and they occasionally raise their voices to each other. However, philosophy and science is undergoing something of a technocratic revolution. In many journals, one finds that the employment of emergentism or reductionism hinges on the feasibility of their respective explanations. Emergence, in philosophy, can be best described as the Gestalt property of a complex system. In a complex system, behaviors emerge which appear to adapt to conditions for which the system was not intended. In other words: "much arises from little." Reductionism takes a related approach to complex systems by saying that systems are no more than the sum of their parts. Emergence relates closely to human psychology. While a system may appear to exhibit behavior not expected from the interaction of its parts, that appearance is a failure of comprehension, not magical properties of the system. A reductionist approach to emergence attempts to excise that human failure by examining the interaction of a system's components. Especially in psychology and sociology, there is some opposition between reductionists and emergentists. It is understood that this opposition arises from the apparent impossibility of accounting for all the components of the human mind and human society. In short, reductionists do not reject that complex systems have emergent properties, while emergentists often question the ability of scientists to provide a reductionist explanation of the mind and society.

I'm afraid not. You are correct in your assumption that an immovable object must be able to provide an irresistible force. Consider Newton's third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction So an immovable object must be able to provide enough force to counter the impact of any other force such that it results in an elastic collision. If the object can provide any force required in retaliation then it must also be an irresistible (or insurmountable) force. 

This is a rather tricky question to answer, there is always a different view point. The 'present' is what you can experience Present is best described by experience (though this is also slightly tricky). You cannot experience the past or the future, only the present. Of course light, sound and other experiences take time to reach you so any event takes time to reach you. So once you experience it the event is in the past...right? General relativity agrees that you experience something which originates from an event in the past. However what I would argue you experience is the light of that distant star hitting your eyes. The moment it hits your eyes is the present, that is your experience. The idea of the star, your inferred information about that star etc are all secondary to the actual photons. The line of the present is thin*, yes, but it is where we live so we cannot discount it's existence or you wouldn't be able to distinguish past from future. *The thinness perhaps defined by your reaction time (like the shutter speed of a camera). 

The answer to your question depends on what approach you're taking. Unfortunately, we over in the English department tend to ignore philosophical classifications and take up our own. Being that the qualia of the novel builds itself into a personal, introspective narrative, a literary critic (and I would have to agree, given the agreed set of terms in literary studies) would say that this is an existentialist novel. From a philosophical point of view, the novel is certainly absurdist. The only evolution of meaning within the narrative is the slow progression towards realizing the meaninglessness of the universe and the importance of human agency. Just realize that when studying literature, we classify things based on a quality. This novel is introspective. Or this novel explores themes pertaining to the individual. In philosophy, there is a classification of ideas. I suppose the take-away is that literature is a sub-study of aesthetics and will begin its approach with questions about the work's intrinsic value, whereas philosophy would approach the same work with the intent of questioning the validity of the author's ideas. 

Catch-22 refers to a logical dilemma in which both outcomes are either equal or undesirable, rendering it unsolvable. It's not circular logic, but a logical complication of the inevitable outcome(s) of a set of premises.
