You don't think robbing a bank is ethical? What you think bankers do? Yours is probably posed as a narrower question of legal ethics. But from a broader perspective it may be considered as a philosophical question of the ethics of civil disobediance. How to act if you are caught between two incommensurable ethical commands, usually between "state" and some "higher" authority. According to Hegel, this is the very crux of dramatic tragedy and a dialectical engine of history. He cites the case of Antigone, who is literally destroyed by the historical shift from ancient family duty to the laws of the state.Thoreau's or Mandela's "civil disobedience" are other example, though our modern fates are usually somewhat softer than Antigone's. So, when could one ethically defy a law or violate a legal contract? When one can and must act rationally in the expectation of a "more just" future, however determined. I would argue that the entire financialization and credit-debt structure of the U.S. is overtly unethical, concentrating wealth based ultimately on bonded taxation in the hands of small rentier class. It is "unethical" not only in being inequitable and unsustainable, but in the Hegelian sense of forcing the mass violation of other, incommensurable social duties. The prime example is student debt. Capital value demands ever-increasing levels of education, which becomes an implicit duty of the young citizen. Yet the costs are transferred to other countries (hiring educated workers abroad) or into mass indebtedness of an entire generation. An indebtedness that increasingly outpaces the capacity of future earnings to liquidate it. Hence ethically and socially "irrational." By this standard, I actually believe students today may have a "higher obligation" to not repay debt, one that outweighs the personal or even immediate social consequences. The case of housing may not be so immediately apparent, but there is a good historical argument that mortgages should be valued against average earnings in some way, not according to shareholder value or remote derivative transactions that affect the debt levels yet are entirely unaccountable to the social necessity of housing. Bit of a stretch from home mortgages to Antigone, but hope this helps you consider the issue afresh. 

This false choice between absolute, Laplacian determinism and irreducible randomness seems rather crude, hyperbolic, and outdated, even in physics. There are many compatibilist arguments in the history of philosophy, but even physics today is generally understood as probabilistic, utilizing statistical mechanics with reference to microstates and macrostates. To say that there are limits or "scientific laws" that cannot be violated is not to say that all events can be correlated to determinate causes or outcomes calculated over vast quantities with infinite precision. Nor can we meaningfully talk about some absolute "indeterminacy" as "true." Even "defining randomness' becomes somewhat paradoxical. The choice is not one that is actually posed by the physical sciences, where it presumably originates. Sorry, I do not know how this might be translated into some logical language. I would simply deny the premises. 

Many of the attributes of God entail "infinity" in one form or another. Many of the notable logical and mathematical paradoxes, from Zeno on, arise from problems entailed by infinity, the inability to "de-fine" what is, by definition, not "finite." Kant's discussion of the antinomies and the proofs of God are key texts in this respect. In crude summary, Kant might argue that a being of such "infinite" attributes in not so much "illogical" as simply beyond the proper remit of logic and reason. It simple cannot be rendered by our conceptual apparatus. There is no problem, then, if one accepts that logic is bounded, that knowledge requires phenomenal confirmation, and yet that noumenal entities do exist beyond such conceptual grasp. It is thus perfectly "logical" that such a being would perplex and exceed the rules of logic. Personally, I believe such "agnostic allowance" (not that Kant was agnostic) is a perfectly reasonable and almost unavoidable stance. Kant added that while we cannot "know" anything of such noumenal entities, it is still possible to "think" about them. As such, the position or function this illogical "God" holds in our thoughts can still have value, but leads nowhere as a subject of logical debate. 

These questions remain interesting, but I can't see that "dualism" is being adequately defined here. As you yourself imply, the whole idea that dualists could "prove" the existence of the res cogitans or some "cognitive field theory" and then subject it to empirical testing is not, by definition, dualism. Your question is all contained within a naturalistic monism from the very beginning. I am not sure how "dualism" is best defined today, but I suspect there are many "hard" and "soft" versions. We could imagine Leibnizian monads all operating independently. Or Cartesian substances. Or some "dark energy" wholly irreconcilable to any possible description of the universe. Or systems that operate randomly relative to each other. Perhaps the best case today would be matter subject to "entropy" versus matter subject to "life," even as we seem to be filling in the chemical and logical steps between. But by any "hard" definition I would think dualism entails precisely that which cannot be reduced, converted, or proven. Everything "whereof one cannot speak," as Wittgenstein puts it. It is precisely that aspect of "mind" that remains in surplus, over and above whatever mind is able to observe and reduce pertaining to itself. The very quality of irreducibility. The mind conceived of as a relentless "unlimiting" of whatever "limits" it formulates into natural laws or perhaps even logical principles. So the question becomes: Is this Lockean "I know not what" or Kantian "ding an sich" simply extraneous metaphysical fluff? If we can't see it, chew it, or talk about it, why not just Occamize it? That may be a perfectly good answer from any scientific point of view. I take Kant to be a paradigmatic modern dualist. And many find no good reason for his retention of the noumenal. It is, indeed, very unsatisfactory. As Fichte, Hegel, and others pointed out, by positing it, Kant appears to have already brought it under concepts and into his apparatus. He is blithely chattering on about the unspeakable. My own sense is that Kant's critical philosophy requires it for a completion of the reasoning, free, moral subject. That which endows us with moral sense or higher purpose and prevents "reason" from ever being reduced to computing, not matter how powerful. In addition, Kant argues that we can "think" certain things we can never "know," let alone prove. And in this sense perhaps his "noumena" act like a zero in mathematics, as a kind of necessary placeholder between "one" and its "opposite." So the "proof" of dualism would be a negative, a priori, Godel-type demonstration that "computing" of any sort can never reduce and reproduce that which creates and sustains computing. Or, if it does, then we have indeed become a whirling Hegelian Geist. The great thing about AI is that it really does bring these old questions back in an interesting, tangible way. The instinctive dualist looks suspiciously at AI and tries to grasp: What is it that we are really doing here? 

Yes, I believe Hegel has been treated largely with hostility or neglect in the analytic camp from the time Russell accused him "simple logical errors."Russell himself was originally steeped in Hegel, Bradley, and the British idealists, so his renunciation carried weight. (As the famous weather report goes: "Fog Over Channel, Continent Cut Off.") The parting of ways is usually attributed to the division of interests between Husserl and Frege (phenomenology, symbolic logic) though those two kept up professional exchanges. In America, Dewey and other pragmatists up to Rorty kept up some interest in Hegel. But he only recently crept back in by way of phenomenology in the art theory and literature departments since about 1980, with Phenomenology of Spirit the primary text. Why? Well, for many Hegel is easy to dislike. Wordy, tedious, vague, pompously systematic, seemingly equivocating and clutching the "excluded middle." I believe it was Heine who called him "a man who fears he might be understood." Even for professionals he is very time-consuming and often ambiguous. "Swabians love secrets," went an old saying. But I think there are two cultural reasons he was jettisoned. First, like Heidegger, he simply accrues some vague blame among English speakers for all things "Germanic," in his misunderstood defense of the Prussian State, etc. This includes blame by association for Marxism and "totalitarian systemizing" among the Anglo-American liberals and fanatically liberal Austrian refugees, those godlike figures of modern American conservatism. But perhaps the deeper reason is the very conscious and arguably worthy decision of the analytical camp to work as the handmaidens of modern physics. Hegel's writings on Newton and physics are very interesting. Unfortunately, he produced an all-encompassing, systematic project just before the modern turns in science. Before Faraday, Maxwell, Darwin, thermodynamics, atomic theory, computing. So he appears ill-informed, as well as overweening, wherever he touches related subjects. Here, paradoxically, he is actually too specific. He toyed with the idea of species evolution, then in a famous footnote explicitly called it impossible. He argued that a ninth planet could not exist, etc. Above all, while Kant's limits on metaphysics are perfectly and intentionally compatible with scientific method, hypothesis, and "falsifiability," Hegel's attempt to resolve them in a further leap of subjective idealism are most emphatically not. He actually appears much better in the light of quantum theory, chaos modeling, and such. Some physicists, Einstein included, appreciated the naturalized dialectics of Engels. Bohr can sound pretty Hegelian. Today, compared to modern cosmologists and string theorist, Hegel looks utterly down to earth. Still, I don't see much common ground between Hegel and the analytical approach, where he remains a paradigm of how to "not think clearly." So he'll probably remain in the art and literature departments. 

Though Kant's deontic ethics has been correctly cited, I am not sure that a "categorical" imperative is exactly the same as an "absolute" imperative. And I am not sure that "absolute moral value" makes sense internally. First, it appears from my Kant dictionary (Blackwell) that Kant is ambivalent about "the absolute," and while discussing it in CPR never actually applies that term to the categorical imperative. The absolute is not, of course, the sort of thing that can be "known" and in that way enter into judgements. Second, "value" by almost any definition is relative to some value system, ideal, or "general equivalent." (In Kant's terms "hypothetical imperative.") I think most philosophers agree that this is a very problematic area of Kant's philosophy. He seems to depend implicitly on tweaking assumptions of freedom, limits of knowledge, and divine law in ways that have little if any clear practical application. If we must read his categorical imperative as a kind of guiding ideal or limit test, then is it correct to say that it generates "absolute values"? When he suggests as much for the "good will" or the "person" as an end, things get pretty vague and these ideals seem to stand outside of any real "value" system. Values are relational, and I am not sure that the ground or "axiom" of some value system is itself a "value." Anyway, I am only suggesting that Kant or other deontic ethicists might not be entirely clear on precisely this point, and that combining the terms "value" and "absolute" may be problematic.I admit I am not deeply familiar with Kant. But I do not see how one can, in the end, successfully combine a structural limit on knowledge with an "absolute" standard for practical judgments, except by appeal to faith. 

While I cannot imagine a religious practice or experimental practice without "interpretation," one might judge a group like ISIS in relation to core of traditional, canonical, broadly held interpretation and an evolving periphery or paradigm shift. Both religion and science arise out of the official state interpretations of "natural signs," such as the inspection of entrails, or linguistic mediations, such as the Delphic oracle. Both have a long connection to politics and military decisions. With sacred scripture, the problem assumes a different character. For Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the "People of the Book," sacred texts mingle the interpretation of dreams, omens, and metaphors with explicit injunctions and legal codes. Having accumulated over some two millennia, such writings are full of contradictions and ambiguous rules, requiring a ceaseless hermeneutics that processes past into present. The texts, in turn, produce the societies capable of preserving and reinterpreting them. A human-textual form of evolutionary selection in which canon accumulates around a kind of fitness. Though anyone can produce revolutionary interpretations of scripture or experimental findings, a nihilistic interpretation like that of ISIS or a theory that fails to produce new experiments may subvert historical selection. Though it is difficult to retain a monopoly on interpretational latitude, as with the Delphic Oracle or Catholic Church, we should recall that these institutions had or have a far greater longevity than modern science. In science the "interpretation" of the "book of nature" is highly constrained and attempts to eliminate social "values." Yet the application, as a result, becomes independent and even less constrained. There was nothing essentially "unscientific" about Nazi eugenics...which is precisely its horror. Unlike sacred texts, science itself places no special value on human beings and is open to many different classification systems and values. ISIS seems perfectly content to utilize science and technology towards its apocalyptic, "irrational" interpretations of sacred text. This is significant. We now have the weaponry produced by modern science without the assumption of "rational self-interest" and the constraint of "mutually assured destruction." A whole new level of Frankfurt School gloom.
