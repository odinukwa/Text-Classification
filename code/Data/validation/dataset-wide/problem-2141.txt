Yes to both. Often, jobs get posted in response to someone leaving, and that person had accumulated a variety of duties and expertise in her tenure at the company. Ideally, the company would like to replace that person with someone with the exact skill set. Then, reality sets in, in that there aren't people available with that set of skills whose salary requirements are at the desired level. So they lower their standards. So, to answer the implicit question of whether not meeting this requirements should stop you from applying, the answer is no. When reality sets in, and the company relaxes the requirements, you want to be the first person they see when they look down the bench. You get there by applying now, not waiting to see if they will lower their standards. You also give yourself an opportunity to blow them away in other dimensions not captured by the requirements. Also have to note the irony of "Good communication skill" 

If you're really concerned about coming off the wrong way, you can always drive by the building at off-times (early in the morning, late in the evening, weekends), and see how many lights are on and cars are in the parking lot. This information will likely be crude compared to an honest answer to a direct question, but would also give a rough idea. 

This also has the advantage of giving him helpful information. It may take a little courage, and I'm not certain it's best for all situations. But, even when I was a 22 year old contract programmer, I think I could have done this. What I would not do is go ahead and do this without an explicit (even if "off the books") agreement. 

I changed positions three times in the past few years, and all three job opportunities came through my LinkedIn profile, as well as other opportunities that weren't the right match. In my opinion, having an up-to-date profile with connections to close co-workers is a bare minimum for professional networking and self-promotion. Are there other things one can do instead? Certainly. One can have a more informal offline professional network, if you enjoy doing the work to maintain that sort of thing. In my judgement, the LI profile is the most efficient way to establish this. 

Joel wrote another article addressing this question more directly. In this case an intern came up with an idea that, once implemented, made $1 million for the company. What should be his reward? He ended up rewarding him with equity in the company, which he was pleased with, but was utlimately not enough to retain him. We discussed this a bit on the gone but lamented Joel on Software forum. -- In short, hopefully your company is building a culture where people enjoy contributing to what is going on. There is always some drudgery, but in general the rewards should be aligned with skill level and results and wants the team to be successful. So I would say tread carefully. 

Your boss is modeling a style that could send you to an early grave. That seems more important than making my workstyle an exact match to my boss's. Most people accept that different people will have different styles of work within certain boundaries. Some people drink coffee; others don't. Some people like to listen to headphones; others don't. Some people bring their lunch; others go out or skip lunch. It seems what you're talking about falls within the boundaries of legitimate diversity of styles. Rather and adapting your style to his lead, it seems he should be following your model. 

As a peer, I would only mention it if there is a direct impact on you. If, for example, your co-worker's tardiness means you have to cover for him, it might be better to raise that with him directly rather than escalate that to your manager. That the CEO noticed may make your team look bad, but I would say that is a problem for your manager, not you. 

It is rare that a workplace is perfect except that their pay is below market. Typically, paying below market is will have several secondary effects, which you can discuss more directly, such as: 

So, a diplomatic way of putting it might be, "I want to work with and learn from the best people, and I'm concerned that my company isn't making the necessary commitments to attract and retain them." 

Doing anything unusual is taking a risk. As many of the answers have noted, including a picture creates all kinds of problems for the perspective employer. For one, you are putting image data into a process designed to process text. For another, you are providing information that could be the basis for discrimination. This would probably give most employers reason enough to simply discard your resume rather than give it the exceptional handling it would require. On the other hand, I'm sure you can research the internet and find a story about someone who included his picture on his resume, or printed it using green ink, or put it on grey paper, or showed up at the interview dressed in some unusual way, or sang a showtune during his interview, and was told that this is what put them over the top in getting him his dream job. These stories stand out because they are in fact exceptional. Most people get their jobs through more mundane means -- developing the qualifications for the job, presenting them in a clean resume, leveraging their personal network for contacts within the company, and presenting themselves in a solid, professional manner in their interviews. 

Imagine the converse situation. You cannot work a certain number of hours, but you really need the income this month for some reason either good or bad. Would you dream of approaching your client asking him to sign for more hours than you worked to solve this problem for you? 

The reason you list to not wear the tie is your comfort, by which I assume to mean your physical comfort. Presumably, you think you would perform better at the interview if you were more physically comfortable. I think that should be balanced against your emotional comfort. If you show up without a tie, and your interviewers are in ties, won't you spend the interview with the back of you mind rolling over if you really should have worn a tie? And isn't that likely to make you distracted and anxious during the interview, perhaps leading you to a poorer performance than you would have had otherwise? Unless you have some allergic condition (which you could explain to the interviewers) it seems like this would be more of a distraction than whatever physical discomfort comes from the ties. Your clothes choices are an all-downside, no upside potential. A brilliant sartorial choice is extremely unlikely to overcome a poor interview performance, but a poor one is could defeat a great one. There's times to take risks and times to play it safe. This is a time to play it safe. 

I suppose it depends on what type of culture you're trying to build in your company. Think about what type of behavior this activity incentivizes (and disincentivizes), and whether those are behaviors you want more (or less of). If people catch on that they are competing against their teammates in a zero-sum game for raises and bonuses, they will tend to respond in a way to maximize their own credit at the expense of their teammates'. In some contexts, where employees are not expected to cooperate and are operating as individuals, this may be desirable. I'm thinking of things like individual sales reps ("Wanna see the prize for second place? A set of steak knives...), though I'm sure there are even some sales environments where you want them to help each other out. In most contexts, you do want your employees to help each other out and make each other look good, and such a scheme would run against that. This doesn't mean you shouldn't reward you top performers more than others. But any scheme where it seems that the employees are competing against each other for their share of a fixed pie is likely to have undesirable effects. 

So, they understand that their existing policies are not competitive for attracting new talent, but don't want to change the system for existing employees? It sounds like the company is betting that its current employees are essentially "locked in" at their current employer, either because they have developed skills particular to this employer or simple inertia. It's possible they may be right, and if they can get away with it, it may enable them to attract new employees without redoing their salary / job title structure. It may be that the only way to break this is for some key employees to call their bluff and move on to another position. Otherwise, it seems that the company is willing to accept the decreased morale (which it seems to be anticipating) in order to only implement the change just for new hires. 

You want to ensure that the target of your humor is not one that the person on the other side of the table is going to identify with. Obviously this will rule out ethnic, religious, and sexual humor, which I hope you would eschew anyway. But also about specific job roles -- it would be bad for a developer to joke about stupid business owners always changing requirements and not understanding the development process, but it may be OK to find some humor in the reality of shifting requirements without the implying that those changing the requirements are shifting are stupid. Your safest target is probably yourself -- self-deprecating humor that doesn't make you look stupid, but shows that you don't take yourself completely seriously. From the perspective of you interviewing the company as mush as they're interviewing you (assuming you're not looking for a job to pay this month's rent), if your personality is humorous, you probably do want to let some of that come through a bit in the interview. If the reaction is stony silence, that may indicate that this place won't be a great fit for you, and you'll be constantly stifling yourself. These are people you'll be next to for 40+ hours a week. Do you want to spend that time pretending you don't have a sense of humor? 

I think the ideal way to approach it would be to say that you're at 38 hours for the week, and you think it will take another 4-5 hours (or whatever) to achieve his desired goal. From here he has the following options: 

In my experience, the main advantage is mutual convenience. If the candidate has a full time job, meeting before or after hours in a coffee shop means she does not have to explain a prolonged absence from her current employer. As a candidate, I actually suggested this a couple of times when I was employed at a location on the outer edge of the suburbs that it was difficult for me to get away from. These have either been "getting to know you" type initial contacts or "we'd like you to meet one more person" type chats after I had already gone through more formal interviews. I have also done this with out of town employers who don't have a local office (e.g. a consulting company based in another city trying to establish a presence in your city). As others have mentioned, this will generally be a "cultural fit" type interview rather than a technical skills assessment. I would expect it to be a bit less formal than an on-site interview. I would expect the candidate to be dressed on the dressy side of business casual, but not to pull out the "interview suit." All parties understand that the candidate is coming from / going to her current job, and may not want to set off red flags. I would feel free to accept an offer of a beverage, or have one already if you arrive first. Despite being informal, you'll want to observe common-sense manners (chew with your mouth closed, be polite to the staff, firm handshake, etc.) If the company actually does try to do a skills assessment in that environment, that would be a red flag for me about how they understand people. 

Makes good use of time (positive) High maintenance. Will use company resources for personal comfort (negative) 

On the recruiter's side, courteous protocol, especially when contacting someone at his workplace during working hours, would include starting the conversation with you by asking if this is a good time for you to talk. If they do so, then the obvious solution is to answer honestly, and arrange a different time to talk. That you are asking this question suggests that these recruiters are not following this protocol. I would consider this in the "red flag" but not "dealbreaker" in terms of their respect for you. It could simply be ignorance or forgetfulness. In this case, you can speak up and say when it is not a good time to talk. Your relationship with the recruiter, like all relationships, will involve some give and take on both sides. It's not reasonable for the recruiter to expect you to be available to take calls whenever he place them. On the other side, I don't think it's reasonable to expect the recruiter to extend his workday to fit your schedule. For communications that do not require synchronous feedback, e-mail is a good solution. Absent that, you can look for a 15 minute chunk of time (perhaps toward the beginning or end of the day or around lunch hour) when you can grab an empty conference room and return some phone calls. Most workdays have times that are less intense than others.
