Finally, and perhaps more important regarding the "states' rights" argument, we tend to forget that the Southern states did not secede en masse. They each held individual votes, and there were two primary "waves" of secession, with the "Deep South" South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, George, Louisiana, and Texas choosing to secede between December 20, 1860 and February 1, 1861. The remaining states (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee) did not begin to secede until mid-April of 1861. The reason why this is important in determining cause for secession is that these two "waves" happened for different reasons. The first wave effectively justified unilateral secession after the 1860 election and even before Lincoln took office. The second wave was not undertaken until after Lincoln called for an invasion of the South, an action that many (both Southerners and Northerners) initially called into question as potentially unconstitutional. (Lincoln's need to quell opposition to invasion ultimately led to his controversial suspension of habeas corpus, among other legally questionable actions.) Virginia, the first of the second wave of secession, initially voted down secession repeatedly during its deliberations, instead seeking to continue to work within the federal government to resolve its issues. It was only after the confrontation at Fort Sumter and Lincoln's subsequent call for 75,000 volunteers to invade the South that Virginia (and other border states) refused to send troops to invade other states and subsequently voted to secede. This second wave of secession is a much stronger candidate for justifying the role of "states' rights" in the argument over cause. The border states largely viewed invasion as illegal and unconstitutional, and it was this matter (rather than slavery alone) that edged them toward secession instead of remaining within the union. A rather intriguing (and first-hand) account of this position comes from Charles Francis Adams, the great-grandson of John Adams and grandson of John Quincy Adams. Charles Adams, a Northerner with an obvious impeccable Yankee pedigee, had not only fought in the Civil War but had even led a regiment of black Union soldiers. He later became president of the American Historical Association. It was during his tenure in 1902 that he wrote (and gave) an oration on why Robert E. Lee deserved a statue in Washington. (This whole oration is fascinating as a historical document from a Civil War veteran around 1900.) Anyhow, Adams traces the detailed history of the events in the various waves of secession, and he points out the critical role Virginia's decision to not secede after Texas had: 

Nonetheless, Congress was making progress using its enumerated powers leading up to full Prohibition. In the Wilson Act (1890), through its power to regulate the postal system, Congress affirmed states' ability to regulate mailed liquor once it entered a state. Regulation of the postal system and interstate commerce led to further restrictions on imported liquor in "dry" states or communities, including the C.O.D. Act (1909), the Webb-Kenyon Act (1913), and ultimately the Reed Amendment (1917). Many such laws faced challenges in the Supreme Court and were only upheld when justified in a particular enumerated power. Given that much alcohol was locally brewed or distilled in the early 1900s, regulation of "interstate commerce" would not have been sufficient to prohibit alcohol completely, and a "uniform act" was essentially a state-by-state approach which was already underway. Thus, a Constitutional amendment was (at that time) the only way to create a nationwide law actually banning alcohol sale and distribution in general. The Lochner era came to an end with the so-called "Switch in Time that Saved Nine," when Justice Owen Roberts started voting to uphold sweeping federal powers in 1937, thereby creating a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court that was reluctant to declare legislation unconstitutional on the basis of the enumerated powers. (Whether Roberts's decision had anything to do with FDR's threat to enlarge the Supreme Court and appoint enough new justices to override his opponents is something that historians have long debated. Roberts himself declared that his decision to "switch sides" had nothing to do with FDR's plan.) In any case, laws regulating controlled substances rapidly followed the 1937 shift, such as the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and various new laws regulating marijuana, etc. By the early 1940s, there were effectively few restrictions left that constrained the "interstate commerce" clause, which was now interpreted to be able to regulate any economic activity, from commerce only within states to personal goods consumed on one's own property. Thus, Congress prior to 1937 had only limited powers to regulate manufacture, sale, and transportation of most substances (alcohol included), and mostly resorted to taxation as a remedy. After about 1942 Congress has had basically unlimited power to pass such regulations as long as they do not interfere with specific individual rights. Thus, a sweeping prohibition of alcohol from the 1910s-1930s required a Constitutional amendment, but subsequent prohibition and regulation of various other drugs has been achieved through "normal federal laws." 

Solely on the basis of the ruling in Texas v. White, a reasonable interpretation would conclude that the matter had not been settled law previously. This is not unusual in Supreme Court rulings: novel Constitutional interpretations are often applied retroactively to earlier circumstances that led to a case. In fact, it's difficult to figure out how the Court could function otherwise unless all Constitutional interpretation had been previously settled once and for all time. This does not imply the secession was "legal" in 1861, only that it was not clearly settled law at that time. 

The closest thing I've found to a detailed history of this is here. It's not written by a professional historian, and it's a long and rather rambling essay. (It also was apparently written before the 2000 election, so it doesn't cover recent developments as discussed in the question.) But it basically does trace the history of the Electoral College in detail, including a lot of information on when states switched methods of selecting Electors. 

As other answers have mentioned, there were state and local laws that prohibited alcohol before the Constitutional amendment. And there is the obvious fact that a Constitutional amendment is a more permanent measure than a normal law, which would require a more complex measure to overturn. (There may be a parallel to the moves in recent years to enshrine gay marriage bans in state Constitutions; in most cases there were already laws in place, but a Constitutional amendment was thought of a something that might be "more permanent" and wouldn't be overturned easily if a different party came into power.) However, the question is a bit more complicated, because one might argue that -- at the time -- a "normal federal law" couldn't be used. Or, if it were used, it could not achieve the sweeping goals of the temperance movement in truly prohibiting alcohol. Furthermore, a law prohibiting alcohol at that time might have been successfully challenged and overturned by the Supreme Court. That's the short explanation. To understand the situation in detail, we have to consider the history of Constitutional law in the United States. 

In general, I agree with the (excellent) answer by Doug T. that the failure to resolve the issue of slavery was the major issue leading up to secession. With the election of Lincoln and the Republicans, many of whom had used anti-slavery rhetoric, the Deep South in particular felt that it no longer could count on its pro-slavery perspective being adequately represented at the federal level. We can read this directly in the official justification for secession in the first state to secede, South Carolina:
