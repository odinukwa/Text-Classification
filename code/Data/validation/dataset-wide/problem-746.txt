One thing you haven't mentioned: when does the noise occur relative to crank position? Does it make the noise through the entire revolution of the crank arm? Is the noise loudest at a certain point in the crank revolution (say 2 o'clock)? I had a customer come in one time with a sound they absolutely could not get rid of and they went through most of the steps you mentioned. Turned out is was one of the chainring bolts. A little grease on the threads and the problem was gone. It was a ridiculously easy fix for a ridiculously maddening problem!! May not fix your problem but it only takes a couple of minutes to try this solution. You should make sure that all threaded surfaces have grease or anti-seize compound on them. Bare metal threading into bare metal is no-no as it leads to annoying noises, bolts coming loose or bolts seizing/corroding. Good luck! 

Really hard to say without knowing what hub you're running. Most likely the pawls failed inside the cassette body. The pawls and springs are the mechanism which allow cassette to spin freely independent of the wheel (like when you coast or spin the cranks backward). When forward pressure is applied to the cassette the pawls and springs engage and thus move the rear wheel. Fixing them can be a very simple process involving nothing more than a couple of allen wrenches or a rather more involved process requiring replacement of the cassette body. Really depends on the specific hub involved. 

The only Fort frames I've seen have been their cyclocross bikes and all of those were aluminum. Assuming we're talking about the same Czech made Fort frames then your only option is a new frame. Aluminum is effectively not repairable the way titanium, steel or carbon are. Depending on the age of the frame you might be able to get it replaced by the importer under warranty assuming you're the original owner. Then again, an alloy frame designed for racing (and especially cyclocross racing) isn't expected to last forever. Head tubes do take a major beating, especially in cross. Between the bumps and braking forces it's not exactly uncommon to see cracked head tubes. 

Safety. Improperly glued tubulars can roll off in a corner. This is not to be taken lightly. Even top pros have rolled tubulars (Joseba Beloki famously went down hard in the 2003 Tour de France, effectively ending his career) On a long descent dragging your brakes can heat up the rim enough to soften the glue resulting in a rolled tire. Expense. A decent tubular costs significantly more than a good clincher. Repair. You can't patch a tubular during a ride. You pretty much have to replace the entire tire. This means you need to carry at least one spare tire per ride (and hope you don't get more than one flat!) This BTW pretty much negates any weight savings which are trivial to begin with. Hassle. Mounting tubulars is a multi-day process, especially if you're mounting them on bare rims for the first time. Getting the tire onto the rim is significantly more difficult than mounting even the toughest clincher. 

I guess it's unlikely you're using 11-speed in this set up, but if you are, then none other than Lennard Zinn has discovered that 11-speed Shimano, SRAM and Campag are near enough in spacing to be compatible. 

I thought this would be simple. The problem is that the entire brake assembly needs to be rotated to screw into a thread built-in to the fork. There's also a hex/allen hollow tube-nut at the back (see red arrows), but this doesn't do anything until the bolt has screwed through. I was hoping to put the metal loop of the mudguard in front of the fork so the brake would clamp it tight (with a washer not pictured). But when you put the mudguard in place you cannot rotate the brake to screw it in, because the lever arms catch on the plastic mudguard. Is there some trick to this bicycle-tetris that I'm missing or is this simply the wrong kind of mudguard for this fork/brake? 

Coordination: When riding in a group of singles, it can be hard to stay together on a hill climb, because everyone climbs at different paces. It depends on so many factors, weight, gear ratios, preferred cadence, getting out of the saddle when it feels comfortable and so on. Being forced to climb faster or even slower than you'd like to can upset a rider's rhythm. On a tandem it's more likely that your hill-climbing rhythm will be awkward. If the captain wants to stand up, the cadence becomes more "stompy", leaving the stoker feeling they're not able to put much power in. If the stoker stands, they can end up rubbing their face on the captain's back. If they both stand, then the tandem can be hard to control unless the captain is much heavier and stronger than the stoker. Power-to-weight ratio: A tandem with two light riders feels similar in pace to a single with a heavy rider. Most heavier riders are slower on climbs. Lack of aerodynamic advantage: The Coordination factor above is more than compensated for on the flat by a tandem's aerodynamic advantage: 195% power for perhaps 120% aerodynamic drag. However, air resistance is negligible on a climb. It may be that other sources of drag are not reduced so much. For example: 

Cleated pedals require special shoes to go with them, and there are several (incompatible) systems. The one pictured is Shimano SPD, probably the most popular. The ones shown also have a flat side for use with normal shoes. To get into the pedals, you push forwards and down until a click is heard. It can take a bit of fiddling to line them up, but with practice you're always connected in under 2 seconds. Disconnecting requires twisting your heel to the left or right, something which I find comes naturally when trying to get off in a hurry. Shimano also do "beginner" SPDs which will disconnect more easily. This might present an additional hazard to the experienced cyclist pedalling hard and throwing the bike around. SPD pedals are adjustable, so you can set how hard you have to push/pull to disconnect. I'd strongly recommend setting them quite loose to begin with and tightening up any time you come out of the clips accidentally. In conclusion: In my opinion, cleated pedals are easier and safer than cages. However, both systems do present a risk that you won't be able to get your foot down quickly when you stop, resulting in you and the bike falling over sideways. As this only happens when going very slowly, it's unlikely to cause serious injury in itself (although you could break an arm/collarbone trying to catch yourself). It's more serious in traffic or precarious situations. So: 

Generally speaking, the deeper the rim the more noise the wheel makes. A pronounced whooshing noise isn't unusual among deep dish wheels and disc wheels (as in the solid wheels, not the brakes) are even noisier. I had Cinelli and Hed discs when I raced and used to love the sound of them (the ride, not so much!) I would personally be very nervous of the no brand Chinese carbon wheels, frames and parts being sold on eBay. I've been hearing some absolute horror stories from shops and race mechanics. 

I've glued hundreds of tubulars and learned the craft from some of the best mechanics in the sport including a former wrench with the Motorola team and a former Mavic Service Course mechanic. These days tubulars are really only used in cyclocross, track and at the very top level of the sport. There are some very distinct downsides: 

No. If nothing else you'd need to strip the frame to have it repainted after the guides are brazed into place. 

Check out the IRD Defiant wide range double crankset $URL$ It has a 94bcd which allows it to run 46x30 rings. Combine that with a 12-27 cassette or freewheel and you'll have plenty of range. Going to a triple presents a few problems: 

3mm is definitely not enough, especially with plastic fenders! A good rule of them is your fenders should be at least 10mm wider than your tires. I run 42mm tires on one bike and it has 58mm fenders. On my other bike I run 32mm tires and 45mm fenders. You also want at least 12mm between the inside of the fender and the tire. Ideally, you should have 20mm between the tire and point on the frame the fender bolts to (to account for fender thickness, protruding bolt heads and mounting hardware). Keep in mind poorly fitted fenders can be a safety issue. If an object gets kicked up into the fender it can cause a crash. Some good articles on fenders: $URL$ (Jan probably knows more about fenders than anyone in the cycling biz!) 

Loosen that top bolt however many turns you think you tightened it and maybe a few extra. Also loosen the bolt (or two) at the back of the stem. Set the bike on the ground, stand next to it and turn the handlebars 90 degrees. Now squeeze and hold the front brake. Don't let go. Try to roll the bike back and forth. You should feel a slight knocking sensation. This is play in the bearings (bad!) Tighten the top bolt a half turn. Repeat steps 2 & 3. Repeat step 4 until the knocking sensation is gone. Key here is to adjust the top bolt in very small increments until the play/knocking is just removed. Any tighter and you'll create binding which will prematurely wear out the bearings. Tighten the bolt or bolts at the rear of the stem. 

I don't know the exact model (probably is Trainer as shown on the top tube decal) but it was likely built sometime right around 1984, most likely 1984-1986 judging by the parts. The brand was known as Motobecane for most of their history. They went bankrupt in 1981 and were bought by the Japanese (Yamaha or Suzuki, I forget which) who relaunched the brand in 1984 as MBK (like many other French bike companies, they made more than just bikes - see also Peugeot). The other giveaway is the Sachs-Huret rear derailleur. Sachs and Huret were separate companies - one German, one French - prior to 1980. In 1987 they introduced an indexing system to keep up with SIS which had come out the year prior from Shimano and was a massive hit. In the late 90s the combined company was bought by the American SRAM company. The shift levers look to be friction so that dates them to after the Sachs/Huret merger but before the advent of indexed shifting. It is an entry level bike. The big giveaway is the tubing decal which says "Hi Tensile". Hi Tensile (or Hi-Ten) is the lowest grade of tubing used in bikes. Pretty much the same stuff used in Huffy and other department store bikes. That said, not all Hi-Ten is created equal and there are actually some Hi-Ten frames that ride quite nicely even if it's far from being the lightest tubing. Nicer level Motobecanes of the era would have been made using Reynolds 531 or various grades of Vitus steel tubing. As you've probably discovered by now the bottom bracket is a regular taper with English threads. Most French bike companies stopped using French threads in the late 70s/early 80s much to the relief of bike shop mechanics everywhere! 

I think this should be possible, as long as your wife is happy in the navigator position and you are OK with being the bug-shield. Having the larger person on the back is difficult, but may be possible with unusual designs. I'm always banging on about how important bike fit is and a tandem is no different. Do make sure you try as many as possible before buying as it's a big investment. If you are in or are visiting the UK, you can try the Tandem Experience, which we found very helpful. We visited a (fairly) local bike shop and they found us a bike which fitted us and gave us some tips on a harmonious ride. It would be worth calling to discuss sizing in advance. SJS Cycles/Thorn make popular touring tandems and they do a L/Xxs size frame which might fit you both (I couldn't see precise numbers). Note that it's very likely you'll need different crank lengths, or you may argue over gear selection. There are any number of frame builders who could build something to fit you both, but that's a big investment, especially if you haven't had a chance to ride a tandem together properly. It's not just the bike fit that counts, you need to have at least a day out to get used to it and ensure you can both enjoy it and the compromises involved. However, don't let that put you off. One of the best things about tandeming is the easy conversation on a long ride. The next best thing is long, gentle down hills. Have fun. 

I think you need more rest. It's easy to forget that you don't get fitter and stronger during exercise, but when your body recovers after exercise. I admire your motivation and the effort you're putting in, if you don't get enough rest in between exercise, it may actually take longer to get fit (and be more painful). By rest I mean whatever ordinary daily activity that you're already accustomed to. Maybe a short walk to shops, daily chores whatever is normal for you. If you're especially worn out, then a bit of extra sleep can work wonders in my experience. It will depend on the rest of your lifestyle, but aim to take at least one, but ideally 3, days off between cycling. YMMV, but I find this is how long it takes for the aches to subside after some unusual exercise. If you absolutely must get fit super-fast, then at least switch to another form of exercise on "rest" days. Swimming for example should give your legs a rest. 

As long as you've got your key with you - some of them stay in the lock when it's unlocked - it's easy. No more excuses! 

Rudeness Bit of a personal opinion on whether it's rude. Personally I'm not bothered at all. I'm more offended by dry creaky chains. I think legally (in the UK, at least), it legal for anyone to show their bare chest in public, regardless of gender.
