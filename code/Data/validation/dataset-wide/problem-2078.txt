How you can improve the situation depends on your role in the team. Is this your team, as in you're a team lead or manager? Or are you "just" a team member who, in the eyes of those who didn't get selected, just got lucky? Are all of these people newly hired, or was the team formed by internal restructuring? Some of your coworkers may have a legitimate gripe based on seniority, if they've been at the company for 10 years and got passed over in favor of someone relatively wet behind the ears. If everyone was hired at roughly the same time, but someone might have more industry experience than someone who's going, they again might resent this opportunity being given to a relative newbie in the rat race. On the other hand, that may be exactly why these people were chosen for this "training"; they need it more. They're less knowledgeable, less well-connected to their peers, and so would get more than a free trip out of this opportunity. If you don't have disciplinary authority over your coworkers, then this isn't your problem and doesn't require your efforts to improve it. You owe your coworkers nothing but the effort towards the team and its goals for which you are compensated with your salary, and anything you try to give them as a consolation will either be viewed as woefully inadequate compared to a free trip out of the country, or it will enable them; they'll expect these "kickbacks" any time a benefit is given to you (even if it's more fairly distributed). You certainly won't repair any honest friendships (and any honest friendships would survive something like this anyway). If you have the authority to hire/fire, or at least issue directives that the team must follow, then this is your problem. You are being accused of favoritism (even if it wasn't your decision, as their "boss" you're the most visible proxy of the higher-ups who did), and even if any decision that could have been made would be no more or less fair than this one, the point remains that it's a benefit seen to be unevenly applied across the team. How you can correct this imbalance depends on your resources and those of your company. If you're in the U.S., it's baseball season; does your company have access to a box at the local field, to which you could give out some free tickets to a game? Is there a trade convention scheduled a little closer to home (or maybe further, like Vegas) in the near future that some of the members who missed out this time could attend? At the very least, maybe there's some "manager-approved time off" in order, for which you'd look the other way if it didn't make it into their pay period reporting. Now, I'm not advocating maliciously breaking any company rules, or acting in open defiance of any decision made by a higher-up, but if you have the responsibility for smoothing this over, then by the same token you generally have the authority to make the rules, at least as far as they apply to your team. 

Nothing to lose by keeping open minded and having an exploratory conversatiin. Sometimes better opportunities can have a unique way of finding us in the market. I would talk to them and consider why they targeted you and see for yourself if it is a potential area of interest. Good luck! 

I agree with what everyone else said. Nothing suspicious sounding about this. Besides why would it be a test - they are separate to your company? The bottleneck that was preventing them from immediately moving forward went away for one reason or another. 3 main potential reasons: 1) they got more resources 2) they got more project work 3) unexpected decrease in worker supply 

At my last job we scheduled work based on an "ideal hours" concept; hours spent heads-down, flat-out coding new parts of the project (which from an external viewpoint is "forward progress" aka productivity). An 8-hour day has 5 to 6 ideal hours; the rest of this time is spent in meetings, on phone calls, dealing with technical problems, fixing bugs in previous development, refactoring code and paying off other technical debt, etc. All of it's necessary, none of it moves the project forward. In practice, one calendar day may be spent completely heads-down coding and thus may have 8 ideal hours, while the next day may be spent primarily in client meetings and may have zero ideal hours spent coding. It averages out. I will echo other answers and say that your company is unique even among others in the same industry or niche, and thus the ratio of "ideal" to working hours is going to be different. It's usually better to estimate in terms of "programmer-days". Whatever the ideal-to-working ratio is, how many calendar days should a developer be expected to take to finish a work item, given past performance and the estimated complexity of the task? The overwhelming majority of schedulable work items will take more than one programmer-day to complete. Anything smaller than about half a programmer-day can usually be shoehorned in wherever it fits, provided it doesn't turn into the following: 

Best way to combat this is don't separate out the different internal roles explicitly. Just have two sub sections inside the job. This way nobody forgets that it was still the same company. 

You are obviously opportunistic but as others have pointed out in the long run too much jumping is a flight risk. Are there or her factors that you are moving for? Could it be that aside from money there was xyz missing and also not making you stick around? I would focus in identifying xyz and find a place which offers these other sticking points to keep you from jumping boat so often. Is it lack of growth opportunities? You can make this known and get this grandfathered into your offer eg performance evaluation in 12 months or promotion consideration in 12 months 

Nope, because the bonus due is due after you leave. The bonus is, among other things, an incentive to keep you around. If they payed out pro rata whenever someone left, they'd lose that incentive. In my line of work (software development), bonuses are sometimes offered as an incentive to get the project done on time. The bonus is thus conditional on two things; first, that the project is completed by deadline (completed having the meaning of "the client agrees that development is complete"), and second, that you are still employed as of when they pay the bonus. 

This happens quite often. Maybe there is another person with a similar name and they misentered. I would say - "hi there. Was this note intended for me?" 

Ignoring is not a solution as it won't go away and will continue to be bothersome. Honestly you need a process oriented solution. Make it clear that you need x number of days lead time. Create a project request queue or use a open source tool like JIRA. Make it known that this will help you help them better and so it is a win win. You can train on how to use it. Maybe talk to IT and create an email address e.g. registrationhelp@conpanyx.com to manage requests if you don't want to use a project tool. 

The "why should I hire you" question is a valid one. Quite frankly, if I have a dozen resumes on my desk for one position, I'm looking for something to narrow it down and produce just a few that really stand out. Why, if there are a dozen, or two dozen, or a hundred, resumes on my desk, why do you deserve this job more than any of them? 

First off, if you work in the United States, you are protected by the laws against workplace sexual harassment. You don't have to be targeted by the harassment. You don't have to feel discriminated against. All you have to feel is uncomfortable, which you obviously do if this behavior is leading you to look for other employment. The banter creates a "hostile work environment", in violation of U.S. labor law. You don't even have to mention the new co-worker trying to fit in; this behavior has affected you personally. This sounds like an extremely small company, if the owner of the company regularly mingles with the people he pays on a personal level. So, I'm going to assume there isn't an HR department to take your concerns to. You do still have a boss, even if that guy is the owner of the company that's joining in. Make your position clear; the humor is uncomfortable and (if you want to mention you're leaving because of it) that it has influenced your decision to seek other work. Your boss is required by law to do something about it once you have reported it. If your boss doesn't act, he and his company are liable for any damages caused by this behavior (to you or others; this includes the cost of finding a new job, compensation for any pay cut you may have taken to get the hell out, lost wages between the end of your current job and the start of your new one, increased travel costs for a longer commute, etc). Take your case to the EEOC; put the company on record as having a history of discriminatory behavior. You may not stay with the company (and thus be suffering damages) long enough for the case to be settled, but you start a paper trail that will stay with the company as long as it exists; if this behavior is repeated and another report is filed, the EEOC will see very quickly that these aren't isolated incidents and will put the company under a microscope. 

Later is fine especially if they don't mind waiting longer to accommodate you. They won't make a decision until seeing all candidates. You appearing busy (if you frame it as not any indication of your interest level) makes you look more busy and more valuable potentially. Also a good trick to unleash for when you do schedule it - go for a Friday or at least Thursday. Although anecdotal I have had superior interfaces with clients/potential employees end of week when they are in a better mood. When they are happy they will attribute and spread some of this positive sentiment to you. Best of luck to you! If you don't get your first choice this time then get em next time
