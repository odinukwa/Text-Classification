This is actually not true. Even in antiquity several Germanic tribes are thought to have moved out of Denmark into the rest of Europe. For example, the Teutones, the Cimbri, and the Ambrones were said to be neighbouring tribes from what is now Denmark. Their arrival in the territories of the Roman Republic sparked the Cimbrian War. It is probable that shorter distance migrations into Germany would've been more common in the same period. Furthermore, during the late empire, several more tribes hailing from Denmark featured in the Migration Period. In addition to the Jutes and Angles, this includes the Burgundians who are thought to have originated in the Danish island of Bornholm, the Herules who may have been driven out of Denmark by the Danes. This is in addition to the tribes that inhabited Scania, which until the modern period were considered Denmark and were reckoned as such in the Viking Age, such as the Lombards. Thus while the Jutes and the Angles were colonising Britain, their neighbours the Burgundians were settling in Eastern France and the Lombards were conquering Italy. 

By the sword: either a foreign invader or a domestic revolt or both forced an end to the regime. By the pen: the ruling regime peacefully transitions itself into something less totalitarian. 

Additionally, the patronage system of France's provincial nobility helped Calvinism spread rapidly. John Calvin, well aware of how the system works, targeted important aristocrats. He constructed a successful strategy based on the hopes that converting one influential man would lead to the mass conversion of his clients and relatives. 

Finland recorded unusually high levels of pneumonia deaths in 1917; in Britain the Bochum Administration of Sick Insurance reported a 40% increase in influenza cases in 1916; and a major epidemic of respiratory diseases swept through the United States at the end of 1915. 

Hunan - taken over politically after the Japanese invasion started Sichuan - gradually fell under central control as the wartime seat of government Yunnan - forcibly brought under control by a Nationalist army in 1945 Shanxi - fell under control in 1945 as Communists decimated warlord Yen Hsi-Shan's army Shensi - Nationalist forces garrisoned the southern regions during the war with Japan Taiwan - received from Japan after the surrender North China - some parts taken over by Nationalist forces, including Peking Manchuria - Nationalist forces secured a coastal tract, from the Shanhai Pass to Mudken 

Before Henry, traditionally, Regensburg and Frankfurt were two leading political centres of East Francia. Here the German kings often stayed and, in doing so, made them quasi capitals of the kingdom. 

Because the House of Austria became Counts of Tyrol, and later acquired Vorarlberg. When feudalism gave way to modern states, these territories fused into Austria as we know it today. The thing is, borders are the way they are because of history. You cannot infer geopolitical divisions from only geography, and then act astonished that reality isn't identical to inside the ivory bubble. Borders do not emerge in a vacuum; wars happen and diplomacy is messy. Besides, both Austria and Bavaria were part of Germany when "they formed in the Middle Ages". Why would it matter whether or not it was practical to go in one direction or the other, when both are part of the same country? Though, Tyrol was actually attached to Bavaria before it fell under Habsburg rule. For illustration, see the following map: 

Standing Warrant Officers differ from the rest by being appointed to a specific ship, rather than specific voyages Ã  la commissioned officers. Even when the ship became laid up, they remain attached as a maintenance crew. Promotions come in the form of being swapped to a larger ship. The Gunner and the Boatswain were warranted by the Navy Board. The Gunner had to be certified by veteran gunners of the navy as well as in mathematics in order to receive a warrant. The Cook was typically a disabled serviceman appointed by the Victualling Board, a reward of sorts for his service. This organisation which was responsible for provisioning the Royal Navy ships with food, drinks, and other supplies. It was merged into the Admiralty alongside the Navy Board in 1832. The Armourer and Gunsmith were warranted by the Board of Ordinance, an independent department that supplied artillery and munition needs of both the Army and the Royal Navy until 1855. These were not usually found on all but the biggest ships. The Master-at-Arms and the Schoolmaster were appointed by the Admiralty itself. These were petty warrant officers. 

The exact path of the "Spanish" Flu virus in its early stages is unknown; and Early deaths from the virus were not recognised at the time and received little attention. 

Many Germans had begun working in Japanese society, where they were reportedly paid fair wages. Thus by the time the Germans were repatriated in 1920 and 1921, strong ties to the local community had been established. The Germans and their performances as well as cultural exchanges left its mark on Japanese society. 

Nonetheless, the assemblies were very much an active branch of the French state. They played an active part in local politics and governance, and while ultimately unable to defy the king, they often negotiated with and petitioned the royal court on behalf of local interests. 

Kind of, but not as such. The closest to what you're probably thinking of is the that began to form in the Pacific around the same time as Europe's Renaissance. These were primarily mercantile communities, but later also housed significant numbers of samurais, Christians and other exiles from Japan. None of them survived after the early modern era. The earliest of these communities appeared after the 14th century or so. They started to grow during the Sengoku era, gathering momentum especially after the nanban trade kicked into action in the mid-16th century. Critical war materials such as saltpetre had to be imported from overseas (principally China and Siam), but Japanese merchants also traded in other commodities such as ceramics or leather by exporting silver and weapons. When fighting in Japan intensified after the 16th century, these settlements were also swelled by ronin, masterless samurai who typically became jobless when their employees were defeated and dispossessed. Some headed overseas to seek better fortunes, or out of inability/refusal to live or survive under their enemies' rule. This is particularly true after the decisive battles of Sekigahara and Osaka, wherein the victors gained nigh-unchallengeable hegemony over Japan. Additionally, the Tokugawa Clan, who achieved ultimate victory, banned Christianity, causing another exodus to these communities. The most successful of these settlements was the Ban Yipun in Ayutthaya. At its peak it had a population of some 8,000, of which perhaps 1,500 was Japanese. The relatively large numbers of samurai provided the Ayutthaya government with mercenary forces and military expertise. Their leader Yamada Nagamasa also achieved prominence in the king's court. In any case, these nascent communities were doomed by the Tokugawa Shogunate's sakoku policy. Cut off from the mother country (trade was restricted to the Dutch, and overseas travel was forbidden on pain of death), they were fully assimilated into local populations by the 18th century. 

There were no armies of several hundred thousand strong during the Three Kingdoms period. However, the largest engagement of the era, the Battle of Red Cliff, did involve over 200,000 troops under Tsao Tsao. In that example, his forces were divided into two main prongs as well as six smaller groups, which were either held in reserve or advancing towards other targets. Within each army, individual general commanded smaller units of perhaps 5,000 soldiers each. Therefore, not all 200,000+ soldiers were physically present at Wulin, where the famous burning of the ships took place. Note that some have argued that Tsao Tsao's forces totaled ~220,000 overall, i.e. some were left in the north to guard his homeland. In this interpretation, perhaps no more than 100,000 actually took part in the battle. 

Depends on what you want to call "Aryan race". The "Aryans" you're thinking of who are "blonde with blue eyes", is a white supremacist fantasy. The archaic ethnolinguistic classification of "Aryans" were the native speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language, and their modern descendents. They are called the Proto-Indo-Europeans and they existed. The modern speakers of the Indo-European languages are however not one "race". Another similarly archaic classification of "Aryans" were the Proto-Indo-Iranians peoples. This name was derived from their endonym (i.e. it was their ethnic self-designation). Their descendents are collectively known as the Indo-Iranians, which has sometimes inherited the "Aryan" designation. It includes the modern Iranians, the Indo-Aryans, and the Nuristani people. The only current "Aryans" are the Indo-Aryans peoples, speakers of the Indic branch of the Indo-Iranian family of languages. They look like this: 

In the House of Representatives, only 29 out of 68 representatives, or 43% (including 1 replacement) were not also a previous delegate to the Continental or Confederation Congresses: 

In their one major operation, Communists forces targeted depleted, unprepared Japanese garrisons[4]. Yet despite the destruction they carried out, in terms of actual fighting they didn't do particularly well against all but very isolated groups of Japanese troops[5]. There is no real sign that they were any better than the Nationalist guerrillas, who - as was the case on the frontlines - bore the brunt of Japanese counterinsurgency operations. 

Others go further and argue the economic situation was fundamentally sound (typically, arguing that the central bank killed a free market recovery and caused the real Great Depression). This is probably a bit detached from reality, though. 

Granted, this is not undisputed, since most records (where there was any indication at all) seem to suggest both censors agreed on the candidate. One explanation is that the choice belong to one censor, but he is obliged to seek his colleague's consent. Alternatively, it has been theorised that normally, the censors make the appointment jointly, but if the censors could not agree, then the dispute is resolved by lot. 

Keep in mind that while high in absolute terms, it did take place during a brutal war involving tens of millions of soldiers. Though rape by American soldiers was not "isolated cases", it certainly was no where near the same scale as the Red Army's atrocities either. 

Part of the Cold War association is probably due to ARPANET's use of packet switching technology. Paul Baran at RAND Corporation, who was extensively consulted at ARPA during ARPANET's development, was a pioneer of the concept. His On Distributed Communications is usually considered to have been an influence on ARPA, and Baran had conceived of packet switching as a mechanism that could preserve communications in the event of nuclear war. Take care to not read too much Cold War into this, however. Packet switching was independently invented in Great Britain around the same time, by Donald Davies of the National Physics Laboratory. Indeed, the term packet was coined by Davies. He went on to build a packet switching network in Britain for the NPL, and his work also found its way to the ARPA team working on ARPANET. 

In this way, dynastic concerns served to maintain a link between the disparate edges of the so-called "Tu'i Tonga empire". The resulting familial ties were a major reason for long distance voyages between far apart islands. Early Polynesian settlers of both Hawaii and New Zealand made return trips for genealogical visits. Unlike shorter distance examples like the Tui'tongans, however, Hawaii and New Zealand were too far away to keep up regular exchanges. Voyagers grew more and more infrequent until they ceased altogether when family ties died out, literally. "Were interactions rather local, to neighboring islands only, with a few rare examples of daring explorers visiting far-away lands?" As seen in the case of the Tu'i Tonga example, the islands were not actually "neighbouring". However, in general most voyages were indeed only regional, at least relative to the vast expanses of the Pacific. This does not mean only "daring explorers" range far, though. Beyond the initial discovery, detailed knowledge of how to reach the islands of Polynesia were often passed down generation to generation. One example was Tupaia, known to the West for having boarded the HMS Endeavour during Captain James Cook's voyage to New Zealand. Even though he had only ever been to a few personally, mostly nearby ones, Tupaia knew of some 130 islands across Polynesia, including Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji on the eastern end of Polynesia, and Marquesas to the east. Moreover, he remembered from his forebears detailed instructions on how to get to the islands. He was not, however, aware of Hawaii or New Zealand. "Did this change over time with periods of extensive trade and integration and periods of the breakdown of inter-island exchange?" The curious thing about the aforementioned gap in Tupaia's knowledge is that Hawaii was reputedly settled by Marquesans and Tahitians. This indicate that Tahiti's knowledge of the further islands did indeed die out after the voyages ceased. In contrast, kinship ties to Taihiti was preserved in Hawaiian memory. 

Most of them aren't really lost, but the precise location is disputed, notably for those resting in Westminster Abbey. The traditional account is that four of Edward I's children were buried together in the Cosmatesque "tomb", together with their aunt Katherine. This chest, or tomb, or perhaps an altar, now sits in the recess between St. Edmund and St. Benedict's Chapels. 

Until the trade route declined (perhaps due to climate changes), the German inhabitants of Upper Valais kept in touch with their homeland through this route. Whatever caused the trade links to drop off, by then Germanic communities from Upper Valais were already subjugating the French Lower Valais. 

Unpaid Requisitions Strictly speaking, therefore, the States were legally bound to pay their requisitioned quotas. In practice this view was not universally shared. For instance, Rhode Island delegates Jonathan Arnold and David Howell wrote home in 1782 that: 

Unlike the Columbian Exchange, Japan was close enough to the continent to be linked into the Old World's trading grid. So, while Japan does have several common originally-Eurasian crops, those were generally introduced from China before contact with Europeans. Examples of these include carrots, watermelons, cucumbers, and others. 

Despite these drawbacks, lances did not vanish "completely" during this period. When the Spanish Armada set sail for England in 1588, Queen Elizabeth ordered an army to be assembled from the county militias and feudal levies. Lances featured prominently in the cavalry component of this force, with 2711 demi-lancers (31%) and 4388 light horse (50%) using the weapon in some capacity.

Notes: [1] On paper, the Eastern Zhou (in its early years, at least) was not materially much weaker than its predecessor. Zhou's eastern demesne, around the new capital, was sizable and wealthy. Much of its western demesne, around the old capital, was reconquered by Qin's armies and restored to the royal court within two decades before being squandered as rewards for Jin . [2] Previously thought to be another son of King You. [3] There is debate over whether this meant the ninth year of King You's reign, the ninth year after King You's reign, or King Ping's coronation did not take place until nine years after the Duke of Jin killed King Xie. [4] During the Spring and Autumn Era, conflict between the Chinese states and the barbarians kingdoms/tribes intensified. The organised State of Chu arose in the Yangtze basin in the south, while smaller, roving tribes of Di threaten the Central Plain states from the north. According to the Commentaries of Kung Yang: ("Southern and Northern barbarians crisscrosses, China is only maintained by a thread.") [5] The powers of war and peace were supposed to be reserved to the King, who would issue orders for a vassal to attack. The king could delegate the power for a region to a trusted vassal, but this was normally done for remote locations because communications were difficult. The state of Zheng was right next doors to the Eastern Zhou. [6] Zheng was only created in 806 B.C., and like Zhou itself migrated into the region from the West. After King Ping moved the court east, Zheng conquered the Eastern Guo and Kuai within four years, establishing its new territories in their former lands. [7] King Ping eventually tried to curb the overstepping Duke of Zheng's powers at court. This was discovered by the Duke, and upon being confronted, the king gave up his own son to Zheng as a hostage for good behaviour. This was viewed as the king lowering himself to the same level as his vassals.
