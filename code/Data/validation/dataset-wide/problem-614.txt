If the teeth don't look worn but are black with dirt you can clean them with a de-greaser you may find it easier to clean the cassette if you remove it although this requires a cassette removal tool otherwise you can leave it on and clean it with a brush and ordinary dish soap, just rinse afterwards, dry it and remember to lube the inside of the chain again after cleaning it being careful not to overdo it as that will just cause muck and grit to stick to it while riding. Do not use WD-40! To check the wear on your brake pads look at them from the side and check for grooves. New brake pads come with groves which allow water to escape from under them much like the tread on a tyre. If your brake pad has no visible groves on the face that touches the rim, they should be replaced. 

I had a similar experience, a few months ago, with a Mavic Open Sport rim laced to a Shimano 105 hub. It's a decent wheel and I am using it for my daily commute. This particular wheel was built by a machine, though, and not a human. Some wheels are built by people, some are built by robots. Robots that build wheels, alas, have precious little experience riding bicycles--they really aren't thinking about what they're doing while they do it. Sometimes their wheels just aren't as good as those built by a human wheel-builder. My LBS, where I bought the wheel, had nothing to do with this wheel's assembly. When I took the wheel in after about 300km of riding--with not just three loose spokes but two BROKEN spokes--they were very helpful and promptly replaced the spokes, retensioning the wheel. It happened again 50km later. They replaced the wheel under the wheel manufactuer's WARRANTY. 

May I use an old frame (pre 1990) of same size as a modern road frame? For example by using a long stem and long seatpost. Or would I have to size up a lot? Concrete example: I ride a 56 cm Merida CX frame (2017 Merida CX600) and am 190 cm tall. I found a nice 56 cm Motobecane steel frame (about 1985) on an online auction site. 

The frame is a lovely purple BMX frame. Judging from your photos it seems in a very good state with no dents or bending noticeable. From the looks of it, it accepts fairly standard BMX components. To find out if it is worth anything, ensure the completeness and safety of the bike and go ride it. 

We like tailwinds as the effort to ride at a given speed is lowered. In the same token we like slight downward slopes. If you base your riding on effort, rather than a fixed speed, you will automatically utilise a slight tailwind. If you however ride at a fixed speed, you simply had an effortless ride. In other words, you missed nothing. 

I'm in the USA and mostly ride on 700's so that is the angle from which I see this. 700C wheels are larger and will require slighty less energy to make them go round and round. If you have a really small frame (like an XS), though, these 700's may be large enough to cause toe overlap. In this case, you're hitting your toes on the tires when going around corners. Not good. Smaller frames often have 650 wheels for this reason and also because the smaller wheel allows a slightly lower stand-over height. 700C wheels are the most common size road wheels in the USA. Elsewhere, my understanding is that 650's are more common. Some touring bikes will have 650's even in larger size frames for this reason--if you need a new tire in Romania, it may be eaisier to find 650's than 700's. The real cons of the 650 is that they are less common in the States and are slightly smaller and therefore not quite as fast. If you are doing Tri and you are doing it just in the USA... I think that 700's are the way to go. 

Please note: while the question asks for post mount this answer pertains to the flat mount standard. Therefore, the following is not relevant to post mount brakes whatsoever. 

The frame geometry of a bike influences riding a lot and cannot easily expressed only by reach and stack. But you can compare frames directly. It takes only very little effort to enter the frame geometry into a CAD programme. Use the bottom bracket as coordinate centre for each bike and compare the frames. This allows you to compare the geometry you know from your bike with that of the endurance bike and the performance bike. You may also part with different stems without incurring costs. There are many free CAD programmes. For example the free and open source project FreeCAD. It uses a constraint based approach whichch is convenient when one retrieves the geometric specs from a data sheet. 

Rolling resistance depends much more on the tread, the shape of a tire, and the suppleness of its side walls. A few points to explain this: A tire with a very pronounced tread will roll less smoothly over hard roads and requires more energy than a slick tire of same width. A ballooning tire that is considerably wider than the rim will have to deform more as it rolls. A stiff tire dissipates more energy for these deformations. If you like to reduce rolling resistance, you might try to get a slick tire, or a tire with small treads. (There is by the way no aquaplaning concern with slicks for bicycles.) This will bring by far the greatest gain you may get. Marginal improvements may be had if you get a tire that is only slightly wider than the rim and is supple. However, the trade-off for the latter are a higher risk of flats, less comfort, and considerably higher costs per tire. Also note, in general a tire that is narrower has to be used with higher pressure in order to avoid pinch flats. Estimate If you like to calculate how much a reduction of rolling resistance may bring in a best-case scenario you could use this calculator. Enter your weight desired power. Also increase the cross sectional area to something closer to 0.7 m^2 to reflect the more upright posture on a hybrid. The rolling resistance coefficient 0.004 assumes very well running tires. Calculate the speed once with this value, then double and tripple it. Example calculation: For 100 kg weight, at sea level on a flat, and 200 W power I get 9.15 m/s, 8.53 m/s, and 7.82 m/s for coefficients 0.004, 0.008, and 0.012, respectively. For lighter riders rolling resitance matters less. Further reading: Sheldon Brown, tread patterns ibid, tire width and pressure Jan Heine, suspension losses 

I agree with the other answers with regard to LBS. Many of them are doing their best to provide bicycle services and aren't making a mint doing it. It isn't a filthy-rich business and it doesn't make sense for most of them to sell used bikes. If THAT's what you'r looking for... If you are looking at a bike from a garage sale, Ebay or Craigslist seller, be sure to look at the components and not just the frame. The frame, saddle, and shiny bits will certainly catch your eye first. Shiny doesn't necessarily make value. The ANSWER to your question is to KNOW YOUR PRODUCT. Research bikes and figure out what it is you want and know what the fair market value is. Many private sellers have only a vague notion of what their bike is worth and may ask some percentage of what they paid for it twenty years ago. The bike may or may not be worth that now. If it's a Schwinn Paramount, it's probably worth somewhat more. Get to know components groups and what levels of quality they represent. Sheldon Brown's website is a great resource to browse before going shopping for 80's road bikes. If you know 600 and Ultegra are the same thing in terms of quality (and good) vs Shimano 2300 which is worth its weight in guano... you can start to get an idea what you're looking at. What was the quality of the components new? What is their condition now? Will you have to replace the derailleur just to make the bike shift through its whole gear range? This is an added cost for a buyer. Are the brand-new tires covering up some ancient no-name steel rims that are going to cost you $200 to replace? That's something to consider. Figure out what the bike you want is worth. NOT what you WANT to pay. What is it WORTH reasonably in the condition you want with the components you want... It's not cool to lowball people or try to weasel them out of their bike. That's a couple steps above theft. It IS cool to know bikes and know what you're dealing with. 

FAG bottom brackets (BB) with plastic mounting rings are very common in Germany. The cartridge bottom bracket is really good and resilient, however the polyamide (PA) mounting rings are horrible. As you found out there is a tool to turn the splined outside (rosette shaped). It is inexpensive and easy to get in Germany (< 10EUR). However, unscrewing the PA mounting rings often fails. The polymer material conforms to the thread and all its imperfections and thus has too much friction in the thread. The bulk of the material is not strong enough to transfer the momenta needed to overcome this. As a consequence it is very easy to simply twist off the entire outer part of the cover including the splines or mangle the splines. I had to remove such brackets before. In one case I could remove the mounting ring on one side of the bracket with the tool. It is easy then to take out the cartridge and get out the other shell. If one side fails, be very careful with the other one. Try to use penetrating oil, use plenty of it and give it a lot of time to enter. Make sure you turn the correct way. both mounting rings stuck failures Recently I had a bike where both mounting rings were stuck*. In my case the mounting rings were pressed in. My frame had no threads whatsoever in the bottom bracket shell. I will briefly describe what I did and then continue with how I think it could be done better. Starting with my entirely futile first attempts. 

I need to move two bicycles from work to home. The route is 5 miles long and car free. My only means of transport is to ride one of the bicycles so my question is this: What is the safest way to get both bikes from work to home in one journey? (without some kind of trailer) The bikes are a Carrera Virtuoso and a Scott Yecora (dropped handlebars) 

I would say that whether a bike is Unisex (men's) or women's specific it is of fairly little relevance. What matters more is an individual's fit on an individual bike. Tall people need big bikes, short people need smaller bikes, regardless of gender. As it says here: $URL$ A women's bike is built to fit the average woman but a lot people aren't average. The punchline is this: try the bike out before you buy it, if it fits.. it fits! NOTE: The photographed frame is a compact frame so you are expected to have a lot of seat-post exposed. If you have to lower the seat way down below the handlebars to reach the pedals, that's not a good fit. 

The foam protects the head from impacts by deforming. The plastic cover obviously protects the foam from wear and aging. However it also serves safety aspects in most helmets: A good helmet has a smooth outer shape, preferably close to a ball, to allow it to slide over tarmac or other hard surfaces in an accident. The hard and smooth plastic outer shell helps this by reducing friction and it prevents snagging. A reason why we want the helmet to slide rather brake ones horizontal movement is to prevent rotational acceleration of the skull. Due to its inertia the brain resist that acceleration. This in turn exerts a force on the brain (warning, oversimplification the brain is in large parts mechanically decoupled from the skull by a gap filled with fluid). This so called rotational impact is thought to be an important contribution to concussion (cf Kleiven 2013). 

method Based on my experience I suggest the following approach. A. cut away all of the PA mounting rings that stands out of the BB shell. In particular remove the PA parts that cover the cartridge. B. remove dust covers from the cartridge bearings. Then remove bearing balls and spindle. Clean the inner part of the cartridge shell. C. chisel away as much of the PA mounting rings as you can. In particular enough to form a depression that functions as a funnel to channel penetrating oil into the gap between PA mounting rings and cartridge. Fill it up with penetrating oil and let it all seep in. D. Find an appropriate piston, eg a socket, and press out the cartridge with a vise or clamps. Excellent support on the other side is crucial here. Otherwise you will not be able to apply enough force (without braking the frame). Repeat D alternating sides. This may wiggle out the cartridge. Apply heat to the empty cartridge shell. The melting point of PA6 is 220 C; the PA of the mounting rings might get soft at a similar temperature. Although, a much lower temperature might suffice if enough force is applied. Be careful not to set the penetrating oil on fire! 

My frivolous answer: Really. Maybe you shouldn't spend a bunch of money on a bike lock. If you get a cheap lock, the bike thieves will have no reason to learn how to open the more expensive type which will leave my bicycle all the safer! Bike locks cost real dough because they are designed to stand up to real abuse. I once had a job where I routinely went around a park with a pair of huge bolt cutters, removing the bike locks (and sometimes bikes) that were abandoned there. The cheap locks are a hellva lot easier to cut off of railings than the beefy OnGuard types. You do get what you pay for, here, at least in the range of $0-50. Cheap locks are almost not worth buying. A $50 U-lock will stand up to several tries with a pair of bolt cutters that have three-foot levers attached to the handles. 

Soft steels (ie ductile, austenitic steel) are often at risk to SCC when subject to chlorine. (Wooden truss roofs over swimmingpools are notorious for collapsing because of bolts failing due to SCC.) While the environment in this case is not particularly corrosive, previous over-tightening of the bolts might considerably increase the susceptibility of the material to SCC. A corrosive source may be salt, which is very common on roads in high concentrations in cold climates. Several other causes of fastener failure are discussed in an article by Hudgins et al [[3]]. It also shows and explains the surface where the fastener broke off. You might compare your fasteners with the pictures to identify typical structures associated with different failure modes. In all cases you ought to be able to see the ductile overload happened, ie the last bit holding to the head. tl;dr A form of corrosion might have damaged the bolts such that they rupture easily. This is more likely to happen when tightening fasteners with too much torque. trivia There's an old German proverb that fits here: "Erst fest dann ab!". An approximate translation is "First its tight, then broken". [3]: A Hudgins, B James, FASM, Avanced materials & processes, August 2014, 18-22 $URL$
