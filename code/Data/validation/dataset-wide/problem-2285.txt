A moisturiser is what you need - personally I like diprobase, you can safely apply as much as you want to and it's not that oily, it soaks into the skin nice and quickly without leaving any horrible residue. I actually use this all year round because I'm prone to getting bad eczema - so if it does the job on my awful skin, it should help with yours! 

That's not to say gas doesn't have its advantages, it's less messy than alcohol (just screw in and go) and usually gives a much better heat output, therefore cooking more quickly. Note that I'm not aware of how widely available alcohol / gas are in the parts of the world you're going to, so if one is much more readily available than the other, that may (rightly so) heavily influence your decision. 

Your best bet is to try and position yourself face down, with your feet at the bottom, and then arc your body to put as much pressure on the hands, feet and knees as you can. As pointed out below though if you have crampons then don't ever dig those into the surface at all - you'll only injure yourself! If that's the case, just use your hands and knees. It's worth noting however that this is much less effective than a proper arresting manoeuvre with an axe - use it only as a last resort, it has no guarantee of stopping you in time. It's far better to take precautions to make sure you won't lose your axe in the first place! 

I did wonder whether there were any long standing letterboxers whose experience would put me to shame lurking around here, but since the question is now more generalised I feel more qualified to answer! What is letterboxing? It's most commonly practised (and originally started) in Dartmoor, and shares a lot of things with geocaching. It originally started with just a handful of boxes on the most remote parts of the moor, and a postcard would be left by the person visiting in the box. They would take the postcard they found, write a little message then send it on its way. These days that has mainly been forgotten - instead each box has a rubber stamp, and you collect impressions of these as you find the boxes. You also have a personal stamp which you use to assert you've visited the box. What are the differences with geocaching? Aside from the stamps, letterboxes also don't tend to contain tradeable items as geocaches do. If you find a letterbox with a rubber stamp, DO NOT take it and swap it for something else! I've seen a few letterboxes where someone's written in the log something like "left keyring, took duck stamp, TFTC!". Not only is this annoying it shows a complete disregard for the hobby and annoys letterboxers no end. Other differences include: 

Conifers are your friend here - they have a sticky sap which can be used as the base ingredient for a natural glue. It hardens relatively quickly on exposure to air and in its solid form is quite easy to store without sticking to everything, so if you have this in mind it's a good idea to collect some as you see it. When you've got your pitch (the hardened sap from conifers) melt 5 parts of it in a pan to one part charcoal and one part finely crushed plant material. It'll become black, sticky and (as soon as heat is removed) very thick. This is great for storage because you can roll it into a ball as it cools, then heat some up when you intend to use it! A word of warning - it's highly flammable, so watch out (especially when mixing the initial ingredients together!) Cook on hot charcoal / coals rather than an open flame to mitigate the risk somewhat of it catching fire. 

Well there goes my #1 piece of advice - I don't want to rub it in too much at all, but it just goes to show how important it is to make sure your boots will be comfortable before committing. At this point it sounds like they're just a poor fit, they shouldn't be causing that much pain after wearing for that long. However, there are a few things I'd try: 

The only way that you can really find this out if they don't provide the stats on the pages is to contact them. However, in terms of a slightly different question (the rough number of geocaches in Germany in general) this website says it was approaching 200,000 August last year (2011), so I'd imagine it's still in that ballpark but may have crept up a bit. 

Is there a formula which can be used (I'm thinking one that gives amount of water needed factoring in time or distance covered and temperature) to roughly work out the amount of water that needs to be carried for a particular hike? Obviously this will be a very rough guide - I know how much I generally drink, but I tend to drink quite a lot, I'm wondering as a rough approximation I can give to others to form an idea in their head. Is there an "official" such formula, or have others coined their own that they use? 

Although you don't want to, I'd strongly suggest rethinking this - does it really matter if a few neighbours know, and it stops an embarrassing incident or two when the police are called out? When I placed a cache in a (public) residential area overlooked by a lot of houses, I was asked to make sure I'd let the neighbours know for this reason. This doubles in importance when it involves entering a garden, since if by chance geocachers stray into a neighbours garden, you want to make sure that if they're confronted and talk about Geocaching, your neighbours know not to worry and can politely ask them to move on. Regardless though, you need to make sure that geocachers know as much as possible that it's the right garden they're entering, and not someone else's - the last thing you want is them stumbling into a neighbouring garden. Personally I'd get around this by a (coded) sign on the door, and corresponding clue - "XYFH5" written on the door for instance, and then "Come through XYFH5" as the clue. (Sure, it doesn't have to be that simple, you could make it part of a puzzle - but the important thing is that it has to be as unambiguous as possible!) 

It seems you can get fuel for stoves in either gas form (butane, propane, etc.) liquid (methylated spirit) or solid fuel tablets. What are the particular advantages and disadvantages with each format, and when might you use one over the other? 

I'd say none of those rules are "proven" - they're very, very rough estimates based on a very rough description of average. Some people will fall unconscious a lot sooner than 3 minutes with no air, some can last a lot longer. In terms of food, David Blaine lasted 44 days suspended in a transparent box in London - there have been other reports of people lasting a lot longer, and some not lasting that amount of time at all. If you're fit and healthy with a fair bit of fat on you, your body will break it down and last a lot longer than someone who's (for instance) skinny and underweight. Likewise it depends what you do in those days - if you're hiking heavily without food, you won't last anywhere near as long as if you weren't going anywhere or using much energy. 

As a rough guide to waterproofness - 5000mm is generally rainproof but won't necessarily stand up well to torrential rain. Around 15000 should be fine in that context. If you go higher than that then you're looking at fabric that can be immersed in water and still stay waterproof for a while, but should be ample for any rain shower that might come along! Breathability works on a similar scale, 5000 being ok-ish, but 15000-20000 is where it makes sense to look if you get very hot and sweaty. Don't use these figures as gospel though, there's no standard testing practice so results will vary slightly. Some companies will test when new for instance, others after some washes, some will take an average, some will take the best... also bear in mind that these tests are carried out while the fabric is still, not moving, so results might vary slightly because of that. In short, use them as a rough guide but they're definitely not the be all and end all in choosing a product. 

Starting a fire can sometimes be hard enough when it's dry, let alone when it's tipping it down. But when it is, what steps should you follow to try to ensure the fire gets going successfully? I'm talking about the process of gathering firewood when it may be damp, to start a fire in the rain - assuming basic things like matches are available but not much else.
