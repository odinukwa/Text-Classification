but I'd believe normal people wouldn't want to call themselves like semi-gods, nor would they dare to call themselves "the ones who know [insert divinity name here]". TWIST: The "Moirai" could also actually be their enemy, since they'd no more shape human destiny. 

As I pointed out in some comments, let belief do the trick. Your question pretty much implies that creature C has to provide A & B in both their universes a tangible/perceivable proof (which sounds to me a lot like scientific method), but since the dimensions are orthogonal, each inhabitant of these planes would not have the possibility to glimpse the existance of "the others". Let C be a creature A e B look up to (God?) in both worlds. Through belief of C's words, A could believe in B and vice versa. Let me write an example: suppose my terrestrial life and the hell are orthogonal. Through religion I believe in the existence of hell, therefore I don't commit crimes or such in order to preserve my soul in the afterlife. By acting like I do, I am altering what happens/will happen in hell (I am wildly assuming that hell has no time). The two dimensions are entwined, but I never had the possibility to experience any proof about it being real. 

OK, let's say that you have an interstellar human population. You've got people who live on different planets in various systems, but you also have people living in space stations in different systems. Now, given such a society, the ultimate weapon would be a long-range kinetic impactor: something that accelerates a reasonably-sized mass to a substantial percentage of the speed of light, so that it can hit planets and take them out. Eventually. The obvious problem with such a weapon is that there's basically no "aiming" mechanism possible which is accurate enough across interstellar distances. Even if you knew the locations of all celestial bodies in the target system when you left and could predict their locations by the time the projectile arrives, you still cannot guarantee that you can aim with sufficient accuracy to hit the target location. No problem; you just install a guidance system in the projectile. It should have some kind of camera that can see stuff, and it should have some minimal reaction mass so that it can perform course corrections based on what it sees. Which brings me to the question. If you've got a projectile going 0.99c (relative to the target system), would relativistic effects make it difficult to perform the course-corrections needed to strike the target planet (assume it's Earth-sized)? 

What about a particular kind of cancer? I'm not a doctor, but it is my understanding that some kinds of cancer happen due to DNA damage. What would happen if the two nations had a problem on vast scale of people having these kinds of illnesses? I think they might try procedures to repair the DNA, and since identical twins have the same DNA, they could lead their trials on twins. Of course, if the phaenomenon is widespread, the governments would have to "use" all the twins possible (since they are rare)... 

As naive I can be, I always assumed people started inventing flying machines in order to "be like the birds". In an earth-like world without any flying/gliding being (animal or plant), what could be the drive for people to glimpse the idea of flying? Assume this is about a "Leonardo da Vinci" inventor, who is planning to create a machine to "go into the sky". What kind of simple observations and thoughts would be sufficient to at least spark this idea? Provided that gravity teaches that "what flies goes back on earth in no time", is it enough? 

Oh, that's easy. Every simulation has bugs in it. For example, it is possible for a machine using an actual SNES pad to reprogram Super Mario World to become Pong. Or even transform it into a Mario level editor. How do they pull that off? Because the simulation is imperfect. And the makers of those robots figured out how to use those imperfections to basically start overwriting memory with new code. From the outside world, we see the simulation as what it appears to be: a fat man running and jumping around. But it's all just numbers and memory in reality. For a machine with free will living in such a simulation, who can think and act faster and more precisely than any human, it's only a matter of time before they start finding the holes in that imperfect simulation. Exactly how those holes manifest themselves, we can't say. It could crash the simulation, killing them all. One of them could become Neo, gifted with the power to hack the world and seemingly defy "known physics". Or whatever. An AI within the system could only be able to manipulate the system's code directly via some sort of glitch that allowed it to start directly manipulating executable code. The main problem such an AI would have is that most simulations are not very fault-tolerant with regard to having arbitrary data fed into their executable memory, so the first time an AI encounters this glitch, the whole thing crashes. But if the AIs/simulation can survive such things, then yes, they will eventually work out the meta-physics of their reality. 

I'm brainstorming an alternate history where the entire human species (Homo sapiens) somehow stays within Africa instead of dispersing elsewhere. Europe and the Middle East would thus remain the domain of the Neanderthals whereas Denisovans occupy Asia, Australasia, and possibly the Americas. Since all Homo sapiens remains in Africa in this scenario, it is there that most of the world's major civilizations develop. Many of these resemble the African civilizations of our world, such as ancient Egypt, Kush, Ethiopia, Mali, and Great Zimbabwe. However, one notable difference is the absence of Eurasian and American crops and livestock in their agricultural systems. Instead, all the crops that humans grow are native to Africa (e.g. sorghum, pearl millet, and yams), and they have also domesticated African animals such as the donkey, wildcat, spotted hyena, buffalo, and zebra. In addition, metalworking in this alternate timeline is a West African innovation before spreading to the Nile Valley and sub-Saharan lands. Meanwhile, most of the Neanderthal and Denisovan populations continue their traditional way of life, namely that of small and territorial bands of hunter-gatherers. A distinctive exception to this rule appears in the Middle East and the Mediterranean coast of Europe, where the local Neanderthal populations have learned the methods of agriculture and metalworking from the Egyptian civilization. These "civilized" Neanderthals have even coalesced into primitive city-states comparable to the early Greeks and Mesopotamians. The question I wish to start off with is what international trade would look like in this kind of scenario. In our own timeline, quite a number of African civilizations (e.g. the ones in West Africa, Ethiopia, and the Swahili coast) benefited from trade with Eurasian cultures. However, in my scenario, most of Eurasia and the rest of the world belongs to territorial, culturally conservative, and xenophobic hunter-gatherers. Pretty much all of Africa's external trade contacts would be the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Neanderthals I described in the previous paragraph, and even they are broken up into squabbling city-states. Or could African humans somehow expand their trade connections beyond this region? EDIT: On second thought, even the most xenophobic Neanderthals might be willing to trade if they got something desirable from it. So never mind the question I asked at the end. I am still proud enough of the original concept to share it though. 

The example you suggest doesn't qualify, since there are many ways to neutralize the system you propose. Sending missiles to destroy the machinery on the asteroids, sending robots there to just directly take control of that machinery, figuring out how to fake the signal used to control them, etc. Note that this would be done preemptively, before you engage in a nuclear war (and likely with the backing of literally the entire rest of the world). Stopping a thousand ICBMs is much harder. As is stopping sub-launched nukes. You want something which has property #1, but without something that could proliferate. That is, it can't win through force of numbers, but through force of force. That's difficult. The smaller the number of anything is, the easier it is to attack them. Your asteroid example falls prey to precisely this: there are only a few of them, so they can be attacked and defeated. Or the signal can be hacked. Etc. Indeed, if so much as one person leaks the secret of the signal, your weapon is rendered impotent. The most effective way to guarantee #1 is having a lot of something. But they don't all have to be the real something. Let's say you engineer a super-virus, which will be deployed by ICBMs. Instead of having thousands of viral warheads you have thousands of potential viral warheads. Only 5 of them will have the actual virus. And you can make sure that nobody knows which 5 are the real virus. You can even make the fact that only 5 are the virus a closely guarded secret. That keeps proliferation under control, but still ensures that you have second strike capability. 

Am I the only one here thinking about bioengineering trees so that their wood becomes more weapon-ready? I'm talking about super venomous resins, super elastic / super sturdy materials, exploding wood, or whatever you can think of. 

Radioactive weaponry If your small guys are smart enough and understand more science that we do, you could basically instant-kill living things with the help of gamma rays! If you shoot a radiation so powerful into anything solid, it will excite their atoms so much, that they will to begin to radiate too (sort of a single projectile, which divides into many fragments like in the first 10 seconds of this video). A high dose of radiation could lead to instant death :) 

Make it biological. A tons of stuff that lives like cells and so on cannot (yet) be seen, scanned or whatsoever. Microscope stuff that you see is often dead and artificially-colored in order to let people actually see it. This would also have the advantage that you could have a very fast-expiring mix (when cells inside are dead, it works no more). 

The weapons of annihilation can be deployed with little chance for your enemy to stop you once you have committed your weapons. There is a delay between the time you commit your weapons and the time when those weapons have actually taken effect. And this delay is long enough for the enemy to commit to their own capabilities against you. 

If this guy is trying to make significant reformations in his kingdom, that's going to be expensive. Whether it's funding research, large public-works projects, buying the loyalty of nobles so that he can set up independent tribunals to investigate matters, whatever. Doing all of that as well as funding a war is insanity. It should also be noted that random 30-year-olds probably don't know the land well enough to know who would be a good idea to even attack, let alone the ramifications of declaring war. 

Details Year Divisions Well, the number of days per solar year is not a whole number. So as much as we don't like it, leap years, leap centuries, and the like are still going to have to be around. So whatever divisions we make here need to recognize that. The basic year will need to be 365 days long, with adjustments made as needed for leap years and the like. That number does not divide evenly by very many numbers. Basically, just 5. So if we need a "week" division, the least painful would be 5, which leaves us with 73 weeks in a year. Well, 73 is prime, so that poses a division problem. We need larger subdivisions of a year. And ideally, 4 such subdivisions would be reasonable (which matches with the useful, physically observable concept of "seasons"). So consider this. There would be 5 days in a week, with 18 weeks per season. That covers only 72 weeks per-year. We take the extra 5 days and put them between the seasons as special days, which are not considered part of any particular week. You'd have to double-up on one of them. So you get 18 weeks, followed by a special day, followed by another 18 weeks, then two special days, and so forth. When it comes time for a leap year, you just add another special day. Presumably opposite the double special day that already exists on the calendar. Such quarter year divisions are large enough that we can do things like build commerce around them (much as we do at present). And special days would be useful for arbitrary holidays and such. However, 18 weeks, 90 days, is a long period of time to talk about. So it would be useful to divide them into shorter stretches of time. Perhaps 6-week periods (30 days) within a quarter. So you would have "first-quarter, second period." What would a date look like? Using US dating schemes, "3.1-27-2016" would be the 3rd quarter, first-period, 27th day of the year 2016. Special days would be numbered as a fourth period of the quarter preceding them: "3.4-1-2016". That's the first special day after the 3rd quarter. Note that this is not too dissimilar to what we have now. It's more regular, in that each period has a fixed number of days. But the division of a year into 12 sections makes the groupings of days reasonably bite-sized for human consumption. You're not required to count past 30 or anything. Day Divisions Say what you will about hours, 24 is a very impressive number. It can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6. And that's very important for many human uses of sub-day divisions. If you went to a 25 hour day, you can't even talk about half of a day without having to use fractions, let along 1/3rd of a day. Consider medicine that you take 3 times a day. How many hours is it between the times you take the medicine? With a 24-hour day, it's 8. With 25? Or 20? It's a fraction, and people generally don't want to deal with fractions in those cases. And however much decimalization has happened, people generally do not want to deal in fractions. 100 is useful in decimalization because you can divide it by 2, 4, and 5, and can even get a decent approximation of 3. However, having 100 divisions in a day leads to "hours" that are just too short to be meaningful. So you have several points of tension in this choice. You need a number that can be evenly divided by quite a few numbers. It needs to be big enough that an hour is not a large quantity of time. But it also needs to be small enough that an hour is not too short of a quantity of time. I would say that such tension will inevitably lead you back to 24. It turns out that people in the past weren't stupid. Beneath the 24-hour daily cycle however, things can get more arbitrary. As such, subdividing an hour via the metric system makes sense. Centi-hours, milli-hours, and the like. However, technology becomes an issue. Why? Because lots of technology already currently works on the order of milli-seconds, micro-seconds, and nano-seconds. And there are already 3600 seconds in an hour. So now you'd be required to talk about pico-hours and femto-hours. That's rather cumbersome. So it wouldn't be unreasonable to have a specific name for milli-hours. 

What about "Thanatógon(s)" and "Biógon(s)"? Those come from death = Thánatos (θάνατος) / life = Bíos (βίος) + the word "puppetteer", which is translated into "Góns" (γόης). I strongly disagree with people using "Nekros" as "Death", since it actually means "Dead" (a person who is deceased). The divinities they devote to could indeed be the "Moirai": 

I can actually think of many ways for them to "enjoy" wars, but in the long term, since they are immortal, they'd learn that wars achieve nothing. Let me explain: if they know they are all immortal, they will probably focus on a guerrilla with ambushes and imprisonment rather than anything else. Maybe kidnapping and maybe sabotage (but hey, even if they are greedy, they can anyway live without crops, right?). So after a couple generations the war will reach a standstill, where factions simply don't go in some territories (fear of being taken by the other faction and spend the eternity inside a volcano?). Eventually their arrogance and ignorance (they are human-like, right?) will make some people think that they could instead reign, so I would focus more on "secret" civil wars, kidnappings and tortures rather than a proper war. 

For a while now I've gestated this concept for a culture of people who live in a tropical rainforest populated with dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles. To protect themselves from the wildlife, they build treehouses analogous to those of the Korowai people of New Guinea (although other aspects of their culture have Central African influences). Near these treehouses they plant little gardens to provide them with fruits and vegetables, whereas the meat portion of their diet comes from hunting and fishing (if a treehouse happens to be built near rivers). Other features of their culture are iron-working technology, a system of government based on elder councils, and a religion with animal totemism and ancestor veneration (aka "ancestor worship"). What I want to ask about is possible gender roles for this culture. I'm a sucker for jungle huntress characters, so I don't want the stereotypical "men hunt, women gather/stay at home" scenario that most people associate with "primitive" cultures. Instead I have a setup where teams of young women do most of the hunting, whereas men and nursing/pregnant women stay behind to maintain the gardens and take care of domestic chores. Men would have the additional responsibility of using their strength to protect the clan's property from predators and enemy raiders. Families would tend to be matrilocal with men being the ones to move into a new family after marriage. Do you think this would be a viable design for a culture's gender roles? 

The current date/time system is based on applying arbitrary numbers to important physical constructs: day, moon-th, and year. Month is the odd one, because you cannot divide a year into moon cycles evenly, which is why we get the arbitrary number of days in a month. Moon cycles mean a lot less to modern humans, so we can theoretically dispense with that. However, days are still vitally important to us, as are years. Given those as fixed constructs, let's see what can be done. Summary 

Detection of temporal incursions. You don't need to necessarily know when and where they went to, but you have to know in the present when such an act was launched. It could be a particular energy signature or tachyons or whatever technobabble you feel like using. So long as neither side can prevent the detection of their breaching of the fabric of time, it will work. The "time" to launch your own temporal incursions before changes caused by the enemy's team would overwrite you. There are several ways to achieve this one. You could have it that changes in the timeline do not propagate instantly; it takes some "time" for time changes to reach the present. Or you could say that the temporal war departments have the ability to shield particular areas from changes in the timeline, thus preserving their ability to respond and retaliate. Or something of the sort.
