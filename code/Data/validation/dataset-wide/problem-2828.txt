anima (genitive is animi) means "soul" and it is the root of "animate". The soul in this sense is just generally identified with whatever it is that makes the organism alive. The anima is sometimes thought of as the location of intellectual cognition. The word "spiritus" from which we get the english word "Spirit" is a synonym. Literally it just means 'breath' (cf. 'respiration'). The connection between breath and life is common in the ancient near east as well. See Genesis 2.7. 

The answer here is evolutionary: if it is the case that a belief makes it (objectively) less likely the organism will survive to reproduce, that organism is less likely to pass along its genes. (i.e. The belief is maladaptive.) if maladaptive beliefs have a hereditary basis, then one would expect evolution to get rid of them over successive generations. But note two things. First there isn't necessarily a direct line between genes and beliefs. Our beliefs are formed by experience and influenced by culture, so whatever evolutionary pressures there are on our beliefs are going to be indirect. Second, adaptive does not necessarily mean true and maladaptive does not necessarily mean false. Perhaps it is adaptive behavior to have an inaccurately high opinion of oneself, for instance. Or perhaps the most adaptive way to form beliefs about dangerous situations is just to regard the slightest sign of danger as if it were stronger evidence than it actually is, because then you have erred on the side of caution even though your belief was inaccurate. Still, for at least low level perceptual beliefs like the ones we get from vision or hearing, it is hard to imagine how those beliefs or the mechanisms that formed them could be adaptive without being at least usually accurate. 

I'm not sure the question is sufficiently precise. Let's ask: in an infinite sequence, must any given section repeat (i.e. have another section isomorphic to it)? The answer here seems to me clearly to be no. Think of Cantor's diagonalization argument. I make up an infinite number of strings of 1s and 0s, each of which is infinitely long like so: S1 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . S2 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, . . . S3 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, . . . S4 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, . . . S5 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, . . . Now I diagonalize to create a new sequence Sx, whose first value is opposite of the first value of S1, whose second value is the opposite of thesecond value of S2 and so on. Sx 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, . . . Now I know that Sx has not occurred anywhere in any of the infinite number of sequences S1 . . . Sn. (Via proof by contradiction. Suppose Sx is identical to some sequence Sm, then it has to be the case that the mth value of Sx is the opposite of the mth value of Sm, because this is how Sx was defined. Contradiction.) But if I know that Sx isn't among any of the S1 . . . Sn, then I also know this sequence hasn't been repeated anywhere in that infinite set of sequences. I feel like there should be an application of this fact to our question about whether a section of an infinite sequence should have to repeat or not. Perhaps somebody else will see how to connect this last link for us. 

I think there's an ambiguity on the word "work". Sense 1: work is how much gets accomplished. Sense 2: how many hours of labor a person has to do in a day. Technology has increased the amount of work that we do in sense 1. An individual can accomplish far more, in some sense, in any given 24 hour period today than would have been possible 100 years ago. I can communicate with people all over the globe, I can transport myself or some goods several thousands of miles if I want. And so on. On the other hand, this increased amount accomplished hasn't lessened the daily burdens placed upon us. But this isn't because technology has failed, it's because people's standards have risen--you might be able to live in a dirt-floored shack only working an hour a day today, but you wouldn't want to. You want to live in a nice modern house with plumbing, and heat that is fire resistant and will last for a long time, etc. Your house is a lot nicer than the houses a hundred years ago, probably, which means that more work-in-the-first-sense was required to produce it. hence you still have to do a lot of work-in-the-second-sense to afford it. 

Suppose (I*) is true because somebody's put a tarp over the street to keep the rain off. How would the fact that there's a tarp down and the fact that it isn't raining entail that the street is getting wet?! This argument would be valid if A->B is true on line 3 of the truth table, but obviously this argument isn't valid; therefore we must hold A->B to be true on line 3 of the truth table. We'll do the same procedure to show what the truth value of A->B should be for line 4 of the truth table. Let's start by assuming that A->B is F, A is F and B is F. Then we can also construct an argument that would also be "valid" like so: 

Actually, there's an important objection to Lewis's Modal Realism along the lines of your question. This objection was developed originally in this paper by Forrest and Armstrong I think (don't have access to this paper from home). The idea of their objection is that given some principles Lewis is committed to, it would turn out that there simply couldn't be a set of all possible worlds---it would turn out that the "set" of possible worlds wouldn't have a well defined cardinality or something. If you're interested, I can try to dig up the technical details later. Apparently Lewis wrote a reply in the AJP in 1986, but I don't know what he says there. 

All of these sentences are assertions, grammatically speaking. But it sounds like the point of making such a classification is to say that only the first two kinds of assertions could ever be things that somebody knows to be true, because only the first two are objective, whereas the second two are subjective. This is the so-called "Fact/Value Dichotomy". If you want to see a first rate philosopher talking about this dichotomy and why it is false, see Hilary Putnam's remarks here: $URL$ 

Now it looks like (1) is supposed to be just a truth of modal logic--something is either necessary or possible or impossible. This is kind of a weird way of putting it in my opinion--the opposite of necessary isn't "possible", it's "contingent". I'm not sure that's significant though. The argument for (2) looks to be the obvious fact that the world actually exists. If it does actually exist, then it can't very well be impossible that it should exist. The argument for (3) is more involved. The author reports them saying, "it is impossible for it to have been necessary in itself, for that which is necessary in itself is never deprived of existence" and I guess these philosophers must have also been taking it as self-evident, or as somehow contrary to faith to think that the world might have been eternal. Premise (4) is a valid inference from (1)-(3). In support of premise (5) they say, "This possibility cannot inhere in possibility itself, nor in the agent, nor in no-substratum, for the possible is that which is in the process of becoming actual. Hence the subject of possibility is some substratum which is susceptible of possibility, and this is matter." I have a hard time seeing what is going on here. But my best guess is that if there is some possibility, there has to be something that explains that possibility. A classic aristotelian example: If a pot does not exist, but comes into existence there has to be some matter there which is potentially but not actually a pot to be the subject of the change, namely some clay. The sixth premise is similarly difficult. They say, "Now, this matter cannot be considered to have been originated. If it had been originated, the possibility of its existence would have preceded its existence. In that case possibility would have existed in itself, but possibility existing in itself is unintelligible. " The idea here is something like: if the matter had been created in time, then there would have been some time before which it had been created, and if there were a time before matter, then there would be a time in which potentiality existed without its being the potentiality of anything. That is to say, it would be like there being the potentiality of something coming to be a pot without there being any "clay" correspondingly which had that potentiality. There would have been a time when potentiality just had itself and that's what these philosophers find incoherent. But since the supposition that lead us to this incoherent claim was that matter had a beginning in time, then it must be false that matter had a beginning in time, which is to say that it is eternal. The tenor of al-Ghazali's reply should now be more obvious. Al-Ghazali just wants to say that there doesn't have to be any substrate that makes a sentence necessarily or possibly or impossibly true. His claims here sound more like Quine than Kant to me, but that's neither here nor there. The important point is that he rejects the argument because he thinks that modality (necessity, possibility) is just a property of sentences or of our understanding, not a property of things themselves. He's wrong about this, by the way, but that's a different question. 

There is an object o such that nobody conceives of it. (Premise) If (1) is true, then o is such that somebody conceives it. (Premise) o is such that somebody conceives it. (1, 2 modus ponens). Therefore, o is such that nobody conceives it and somebody conceives it. (By conjunction introduction on 1, 4) Contradiction. 

Sortals are words. Types are logical groupings. Otherwise they are very similar. The sort is a type, but the sortal is a term in a language. 

Not a specialist in Ethics, but it looks to me like the fundamental issue here is whether everyone has rights only over himself (the classical liberal position) or whether some people have rights over others (Rawls's position). Rawls has to be saying that some people have rights over others because the strategically rational set of principles of justice that we would agree to in the original position should involve redistribution of income and other similar schemes of social welfare. Consequently, this means that I have a right over other people insofar as I have a claim upon putting the money they earn by their time and talent to use in funding such schemes. I don't know that that's Nozick's criticism of Rawls, actually. But it is a fair characterization of Rawl's position. 

The argument given is valid--if the premises were true, the conclusion would be true. But since no contradictions are ever true, then we have to give up either (1) or (2). Giving up (1) is what Berkeley wants us to do. To force us on to this desperate path though Berkeley needs to give us reason to think (2) is true. That's what I interpret him to be doing in the snatch of quoted dialogue. Presumably he'd have to say something like, "You have to recognize (2) is true, because just by reading and understanding (1) you have begun to think about the object o!" But that doesn't sound right, and Russell gives the reason why: It confuses the properties of our mental representation of an object for properties of the object so represented. Russell's theory of knowledge by description (as opposed to acquaintance) in Problems of Philosophy pp. 42-45 seems to explain how this works. It is like Berkeley is saying that just by reading premise (1) I have direct acquaintance with o, and in that sense if I do have acquaintance with it, I am able to "conceive" of it, perhaps, as (2) seems to say. However, if we take (1) to give me merely knowledge by description instead, then (2) looks clearly false since I can know of the existence of o by description without being myself acquainted with it, which is what (2) required.
