"One day as they were walking along they looked down on the ocean and wondered what was beneath it." They(subject) - on the ocean(object) - One day (preposition) - looked down(verb) | (complimentizer) | as(prep) they(subject) - along (adjective? object?) - were walking(verb) | and (conjunction) | What(subject) - beneath(prep) it(object) - wondered was(verb) I'm converting to an SOV language Word Order should be like the following... Sentence Structure : [Subject] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object] [Verb] Noun Phrase : [Adpositional Phrase] [Adjective] [Noun] [Possessive] [Complementizer] Verb Phrase : [Adpositional Phrase] [Adverb] [Verb] [Copula] [Complementizer] Adjective Phrase : [?] [Adjective] Positional Phrase : [Noun] [Preposition?] So an I getting this right? Or no? 

I'm making a conlang and right now it is SVO. I want to make it more in line with an SOV language. Currently Nominatives are unmarked while only 1 Accusatives is marked in a group. So it reads "Bob kicked Susan and Dan-ke" rather than "Bob kicked Susan-ke and Dan-ke". If I shift this to SOV it would be "Bob Susan and Dan-ke Kicked" which to me looks a little confusing... Another thing is that groups are not seperated by commas. They are all connected by "and" so if we add another name it would be "Bob Greg and Susan and Dan-ke kicked". Looking at it here I can see that it's fairly obvious where the Object is, but it also seems like this would be confusing, especially as spoken. So do SOV languages tend to employ a Nominative marker or an Subject marker so that it'd read something like "Bob blah Greg and Susan and Dan-ke kicked"? Or is it just me overthinking this? 

I have read somewhere that if there ever was a world's first language*, that language must have had very much in common** with the Khoisan languages. Arguments in support of this hypothesis are: 

The degree of literacy of a certain community of speakers is generally proposed as one of the factors that affect the pace of language change. More specifically, literacy would slow down change, since literate people – most of them speaking the standard variety – tend to conform their speech to the written form. Since spelling, by its nature, tends to remain quite stable over long periods of time, the language itself would remain stable as well. What is the basis for this claim? How do linguists measure the impact that the degree of literacy has on language change? 

I don't know how "comprehensive" it is, but the Portal da Língua Portuguesa has a phonetic dictionary that seems to do a pretty good job. An interesting feature of it is that you can change the dialect, choosing among dialects from Portugal, Brazil, Africa and East Timor. 

From my own experience, drinking alcohol has both positive and negative effects to the ability of speaking a second language. On the one hand, it facilitates the process, mainly because one gets more relaxed and less inhibited (thus caring less about making mistakes, as long as one gets the message across). On the other hand, alcohol affects muscle control, makes reasoning slower, impacts memory and so on. These are all extremely important abilities when speaking a second language, so the intoxication makes it harder. So, my question is: have the effects of alcohol on second language speaking been studied scientifically? What are the main results? 

I'm building a world where I'm tracking the languages and people throughout time. So I'm starting from a single point with a single language and then expanding that out as time progresses. My basic presumption based on what I've seen is that every x (in the case I'm working with it's 1500 years, but in the real world it seems to be 500 years) number of generations a language has diverged enough to become considered 2 different languages... My question is what is the physical distance between 2 languages that have diverged on average? Or how much difference should there be between band 0 (language standard group) and band 1 (group that has direct contact with standard group) and at what "band" does Language 1 become Language 2? To be clear, I know it has to do with interactions between groups, but I need to map it in physical space... As my map is set out now each band is roughly 12.5 km away from any other band 

Making my own language, primitive, so I'm trying to figure out how much did primitive languages discriminate different species in the same families of animals. For example; Dog vs Wolf, Lion vs Tiger, Grizzly Bear vs Polar Bear. All 3 of these could be indistinguished in the language and both called dog/cat/bear rather than seoarating them into the two different species. Do older, more primitive, languages tend to call dogs and wolves both dogs, or do they distinguish between the two, usually? 

During the course of their development, the word order of some languages change. Examples include Latin (SOV) that changed to SVO in the Romance languages, Proto-Austronesian (verb initial) that changed to SVO in most modern Austronesian languages, and the Insular Celtic languages, that developed VSO word order. How common is this phenomenon in the history of languages? 

It seems that the term you are looking for is phonotactics and it has more to do with phonology than with morphology. Basically, the phonotactics of a language defines what sequences of sounds are allowed (or not allowed) and the basic syllable structure. For example, in Dutch the syllable structure is (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C), where C stands for consonant and V, for vowel. Letters in parentheses indicate optional sounds. Having the basic rules, you can, in theory, derive the words (even those that don't actually exist in the language). After a quick search, I could find a small section on Wikipedia about Dutch phonotactics, which, granted, is very superficial. But I bet that if you try more academic sources, you will find more detailed information. 

This means that, in some environments both [w] and [l] can be found, as in the [a.'kli.vi] versus [a'.kwi.fe.ru] example. So, evidently, I'm failing to understand what "complementary distribution" really is. Any help to clarify the concept would be much appreciated! 

I am using A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic and An Introduction to Old Norse (by E. V. Gordon) as my resoources. In An Introduction, it is said that: 

The neuter noun kné follows a-stem declension. But it comes from Proto-Germanic *knewą. This seems to be a wa-stem. Then why does it follow a-stem declension? Did Scandinavians force it to, even though it was wa-stem noun? 

I know Esperanto is constructed on the basis of Romance languages; but what are the main differences and similarities between English and Esperanto? Especially from the following aspects: (how are words constructed and orderly connected? what classifications / parts of speech does English / Esperanto have?) vocabulary (from what languages does English / Esperanto borrow terms / derived words?) semantics (words in what languages share similar connotations and implications with English / Esperanto words?) 

I'm reading the paper Constraints on Null Pronouns by Speas, in which the author defines two constraints for a cross-linguistic OT analysis of the occurrence of null pronouns across languages: 

Since matrix-coding-as-object applies to his son but not to the product, now we are more confident that his son is the subject in (3). The above process is what I think is the utilization of syntactic phenomena that target subjects, which are observations that certain types of constructions only involve subjects (or potentially other grammatical relations as well), as tests for subjecthood in a sentence. By transforming a given sentence into constructions of one or more of these "certain types", we see if the resulting constructions are grammatical or not, and determine the subject based on such results. The more tests we apply, the more confident we are about our judgment. Is this process correct, or canonical in linguistics? From tests for subjecthood, can we possibly derive a cross-linguistic definition of subject? I personally don't consider this possible, since we are only "more confident" about a constituent being the subject of an examined sentence with increasing number of tests we apply; we are never 100% confident. 

Khoisan languages have click consonants, a feature that has not developed independently in other languages. Bantu languages, for example, have borrowed them from Khoisan. So, this was probably some sort of an "early invention" that was not very "fit" and got abandoned along the way. If you look at a map depicting where Khoisan languages are spoken, you will see a major area over parts of Namibia (eastern part, mostly), Botswana and South Africa and two small pockets (one in central Tanzania and one in the western coast of Namibia). These small pockets suggest that Khoisan languages once dominated most parts of Africa and then got replaced by Bantu languages (which, in fact, sorround those pockets). Genetic and archeological evidence suggests that Homo Sapiens originated in that part of the world. 

As I understand from the principles and parameters theory, all parameters are binary. In particular, the head directionality parameter can be set to either "head-first" or "head-last". The setting of one value or the other determines, among other things, which kind of adposition the language will have. Head-first generates prepositions (e.g. English). Head-last generates postpositions (e.g. Japanese). But Finnish is an example of language that has both prepositions and postpositions. What am I missing? 

Although not belonging to the Indo-European family, Finnish has personal pronouns that resemble (to a layperson, at least) the corresponding pronouns in Indo-European languages. For example, the consonant in the first person pronouns minä (singular) and me (plural) is also very common in first person pronouns in several Indo-European languages. Similarly for the second person sinä/se and for the third person hän/he. Interrogative pronouns kuka ("who") and kumpi ("which") also seem to share the consonant with Indo-European. What is the relationship (if any) between these pronouns? 

TL;DR: How can we use syntactic phenomena that target subject to design tests for subjecthood (or even possibly derive a cross-linguistic definition of subject)? I am reading Van Valin's An Introduction to Syntax. It has many interesting examples of "syntactic phenomena that target subject", for example, reflexivization, relativization, wh-question and cleft formation and so on. To my understanding, such phenomena often always target the subject but not necessarily exclusively so; they can sometimes target other grammatical relations, such as English cleft formation, which can certainly target direct objects as well as subjects, as demonstrated by the following sentences: 

I don't understand the text in bold at all. Does it mean the gen. sg. ending might be either -s or -ar, or does it mean something else? Also, in A Dictionary, I find (-s, -ar) written right next to noun entries, like this: 

I believe his soni _i to have stolen the product. *I believe the productj his son to have stolen _j. 

Say we want to know whether his son or the product is the subject of this sentence. Relying solely on the fact that subjects can be clefted in English does not help us determine which of the two NPs is the subject. It is better to test with yet another syntactic construction until only one of the NPs is eligible to a construction, such as matrix-coding-as-object: 

In English and other Germanic languages, noun compounds are formed simply by “appending” the nouns in a certain order. For example, phrases like this are very common: 

How did the two languages develop similar structures (have-aux + verb-past participle), that mark different grammatical tense-aspects? Did one language borrow the construction from another and changed its meaning over time? Is it just pure chance? Or some other explanation? 

His point being, of course, that these constructions were introduced into English by the indigenous Celtic speakers, who lived alongside the Anglo-Saxons for centuries. My first reaction to his criticism was: "Yes, he is right! How could linguists have not seen this obvious causal relation?" But, then, every science has to clearly define its scope. And, perhaps, it is not part of the field of Historical Linguistics to try to explain phenomena, but merely to describe them, based on direct evidence (which is not the case in the Celtic influence issue). So, is the job of a historical linguist to provide explanations as for why languages have developed this way or that? Or do they have to restrict themselves to describing only how languages develop over time? 

In Brazil, the Portuguese dialects spoken in rural areas preserve, despite their own innovations, several features of the language that were common in the 16th century. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the so called “caipira dialect”. These conservative features include phonological, lexical and semantic aspects, and are considered archaisms in the modern standard dialect. On the other hand, a number of innovations in Brazilian Portuguese originated in the more urbanized areas (southeast region, especially São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and then spread to the rest of the country. On another geographic scale, Brazilian Portuguese as a whole is considered rather conservative, when compared to European Portuguese. Historically, until the 19th century, Brazil remained as basically an agrarian economy, while Portugal was the urbanized colonial center. Evidently, this is not a scientific observation (so it may be strongly biased), but it seems that urbanization and the rate of language change are somehow correlated. Is that a fact? 

What books / resources about analysis on Esperanto (and English) are recommended to get me started on such comparison? 

I assume by the "Binding Domain" of an α the author meant the Minimal Governing Category for α, which consists of: 

My understanding is that the two constraints are close opposites to each other (one asks featureless pronouns to be bound, one asks pronouns to be unbound), and the important point of the author's argument is that different languages allow different occurrences of the null pronoun since they rank these two constraints (and 4 others she mention) differently. However the issue is whether this oppositeness always holds. I think that depends on whether the C-Domain of a null pronoun would always match with its Binding Domain, but I cannot answer my own question. Any thoughts? By the way, the author considers the null pronoun to be a featureless pronoun. Thus null pronouns are subject to both of the two above constraints. 

Modern Icelandic maður is from Old Icelandic maðr. To relate the latter to the former, I would say "Old Icelandic maðr is the ___ of Modern Icelandic maður." What linguistic term goes in the blank? Is there another term for a meaning the other way round, i.e., that fits the blank in this sentence: "Modern Icelandic maður is the ___ of maðr." I thought about ancestor for the first blank and descendant for the second, but I am not sure if this is correct linguistic terminology. 

Are these arguments generally accepted among linguists? How much of this is "good science" and how much is just "pop science"? * In the sense of a single language from which all other languages of the world came out. ** The first version of this question contained the expression "direct ancestor". But, as was pointed out in the answers and comments, this is not an appropriate term. 

In Portuguese, Spanish and probably other Romance languages, this kind of compounding has to be done with the aid of prepositions. The translation of the phrase above to Portuguese is: 

The closest word is the French (no surprise, given we are talking about nasalization) ainsi, which comes from Latin (ad) + in + sic. So where did this nasal at the end in Portuguese sim come from? Could it be a further development from French? Something like ainsi becoming assim (and later, sim), by metathesis? 

The WALS chapter on consonant inventories shows that the distribution of inventory sizes across languages follows a normal curve, with average size inventories (22 ± 3 consonants) being the most frequent. This is approximately the number of consonants that Proto-Indo-European had. Not surprisingly, this is also the category in which most Indo-European languages (at least the ones charted) are classified. But there are some exceptions. Lithuanian and Irish (Donegal), for example, were put into the "large" class (34 or more consonants). What happened to these languages that made them deviate from the most common size and from the size of their ancestor, PIE?
