I'd have to second Mauros answer on the main difference between Russells theory and Aristotles as being that of ontology and logic. Russells was attempting to understand Freges theory, which was a first attempt to extend mathematical techniques into logic. The Russell Set, showed the limitation of his theory (using a different paraconsistent logic, the Universal Set and the Russell Set can be grounded). So its not a fatal flaw. Russells theory of types has a new avatar in Category Theory, which is based in a different logic than the classical one; its based on the intuitionistic logic of Brower; and integrates mathematical techniques such as forcing as a geometrical technique; and this is in line with a major paradigm of mathematics - 'geometrisation' is the large sense of the Pythagorean school. Wittgenstein wasn't the first to suggest the limits of reason; this was done by Hume; and before him by Al-Ghazali, in his The incoherence of Philosophy. Much further back, if one steps outside 'pure philosophy', and re-enters the world of antiquity, with what was then the favoured discourse of sophia, that is poetry, and that in its form as the verse-drama of tragedy which considered ethical/moral dilemmas; then Oedipus Rex can be considered too in that light - Oedipus was warned away by Tiresias in his reasoned search and demand 'for truth'. 

If the universe is everything that we see then according to current cosmological theories it is bounded. That is it is bounded spatially (as determined by General Relativity). It has been an open question as to whether it is unbounded in the future, current measurements indicate that it is unbounded in the future. But time unlike space we can only probe the present and memory & knowledge of the past. At every present moment what we see is a bounded, but expanding universe to the future and spatially. But one can speculate - and plenty do - that there are other universes or all that we see is not the whole of the universe. For example the multiverse. Where should one place the universe of mathematics? Is it in this universe. Is it elsewhere? Surely that is an infinite realm of thought. Perhaps one can use a Turing Machine to enumerate every possible axiom system - certainly it wouldn't halt. But why mathematics? Why not biology. The space of possible biological species is infinite too. As is all the possibilities of languages, and scripts and all the poems and essays and jokes that could be written. Should mathematics have that high role that is traditionally awarded by it by philosophy? As a glimpse of the eternal. Aristotle denied the possibility that humans can ever grasp a whole infinity, they can see only the potential. Since this has nothing to do with the nature of the universe - it applies whether the universe is steady-state or a big-bang. It rests upon an analysis of what infinite means. He states that the infinite is not an object or a thing. So it can't be identified with the universe. 

In Model Theory a theory defined syntactically (possibly by some grammar) has models (usually in the category of Sets); what theory (call it the boolean theory - for obvious reasons) has its models exactly the boolean algebras? 

But in fact, Aristotles onto-logic is pervasively influenced by Eleatic monism; as Hegel notes in his Logic. 

This though, empirically situated: for do we not see this and feel it everyday - now I drive quickly and he slow - but time taken, as we take it - the same; when this is taken as a principle (but perhaps not as arche); it becomes Newtons notion of absolute time, that flows everywhere the same at the same rate. A, goes on though: 

So the technology is of no concern, and nor, surprisingly is the production of images and it's mass circulation. 

I think it can be justified. Its not that a definite conclusion can be reached but a certain ecology of contingent conclusions that can be constructed that counts as progress. That other thinkers find the questions and the partial answers provoking revivifies an ancient question. For example here is a question that has provoked an incredible amount of work through two and a half millenia, and where one can see progress being made, but no definitive conclusions being made (even if popular science makes it appear that in fact an end-point has been reached). What is the nature of matter? The school of Greek atomists whose most famous exponents were Leucippus & Democritus prompted by philosophical arguments by Paremenides and Zeno settled on atoms as the explanation for all natural phenomena as described in Lucretius poem De Rerum Natura. At that time technology and mathematics was far too primitive to permit direct observation and experiment. Were they forced to imagine and be able to construct an instrument that would provide evidence for their assertion before their philosophy should be taken seriously - then that philosophy would have been strangled at birth. But in fact their philosophy was taken seriously despite this lack of evidence. The arguments proved interesting and fruitful. It was only this century that direct observation of atoms could be made via the electron tunneling microscope. This was over two and a half millenia later since the concept was first mooted. Newton was inspired by them to invent a corpuscular theory of light. This in detail was wrong. But could be said to be partially vindicated by the discovery of photons. The Ash'arite school of Islamic theology were inspired by them to declare that space & time are atomic. This idea has only been recently investigated via spin foams and spin networks in toy theories of quantum gravity. Of course what is named an atom is not actually an atom as envisaged by the atomists. This would today be quarks. The atomists postulated an irreducible swerve to account for free will - thus injecting indeterminancy into their physics. This was abandoned in classical physics until the advent of quantum physics. What exactly is the nature of an atom? The Greek atomists viewed them as almost point particles, whereas the Buddhist atomists viewed them exactly as point particles but also as spherical this paradox being explained by a use of non-classical logic. Whereas the Greeks viewed atoms as permanent and eternal, the Buddhists viewed them as transient and temporary. Atomic particles in quantum field theory are actually fields on spacetime. They are not points. Though they manifest themselves as such in interactions. Their nature is dependent on the topology of spacetime. Whereas the Greeks saw space as a stage for atoms to move in, here spacetime is co-opted in describing atoms. Aristotle argued against the continuum being made of points, so would have rejected the idea of atoms being point particles, he may have been more inclined to string theory where the atoms are strings (and membranes). Certain physicists (heeding Aristotle in the usual sense of this phrase) suspect that the physical reality of point particles is a (useful) fiction. One can say that the modern string theory is an attempt to do away with points (whilst in fact keeping them extrinsically). There is also an embryonic attempt to ground physics in Topos theory. This is a new mathematical discipline where the continuum is not made up of points. So the debate of what is an atom carries on... In reality, the definitive conclusions that have been reached are in fact contingent, but still true: old good theories are not falsified but made contingently true. 

Another angle on the real, which goes back to Aristotles substance theory; is to say what is real that is solely of its own nature and having no 'accidental' features; prime substance is that substance which is neccessary. The early Islamic & Christian theologians took this idea over to declare (whether one agrees with their theology or not) that the sole real substance, is the neccessary one of God. This is the position from which the rationalist philosopher Spinoza (that is a believer in Descartes onto-epistemological theories) took off from. In Buddhism, this axiom of the Abrahamic religions is denied; there is no ground; there is no essence; everything is contigent - that is dependently arising. Thus nothing real. 

Zalamea from what I've read about his work moves on from here. Badiou takes a very different tack, taking perhaps a cue from Heidegger: 

This is an ibteresting question; I suspect rather the invariance of physical laws with respect to translation in time & space is synthetic a priori. First, the distinction that Kant made between analytic & synthetic propositions is this: 

Linguists are professionally trained to deal with languages; none of them as far as I know deal with assembler or even a computer language like C++ or Java; every language they study are spoken or has been spoken; it may have had a written form; it may be a sophisticated court language or a creole or pidgin. A computer language has to be exact and precise for it to function at all; it can cope with ambiguity - ie overloading or contextual change by scope; but these are re-interpreted to make them precise. Human languages have a high-level of ambiguity, which when contrasted to computer languages are seen as problematic; and it is so long as you wish to program in a natural language or if you fetishise precision; but it was quite quickly realised that a much truncated and modified language was more effective; at the basic level the Turing language; at the chip-level, machine-code; then higher-level languages like COBOL, Smalltalk or Java; this might be called a language-stack. Ambiguity is important in human languages because the world is: what is a chair? Something to sit on; so a log as well as an armchair or a bench; and maybe too the floor if one is comfortable sitting cross-legged; and wouldn't it be unbearably cumbersome to name every shade of red a different name, because it was a different shade? And could a metaphor like 'his granite face' work if granite could only ever pertain to a certain kind of igneous rock? And faces only to humans, or even mammals? So no; computer languages are closer to things like architectural plans of houses or buildings (they just happen to be written in a serial manner - and interestingly one hears of 'hardware architecture and software architects') than actual languages - dead or alive, creole or state. 

This, at least to modern sensibilities seems strange. Is this because in Platos time the muses were associated to the music & poetry and thus by extension to astronomy and the sciences? What actually is an orchestra in Platos time? It surely cannot be a group of musicians - perhaps where they 'hang out'? (It may of course be that this isn't the most appropriate translation of the word). 

Descartes clear and distinct perception means several things. Its not simply about vision, but also the intellect. Numbers can be seen clearly and distinctly in the intellect; though of course they have no bodily forms. Recall Descartes cogito allows him to build up his epistmology from intellect, or the ego. Mirages are clearly & distinctly seen for what they are; evanascent forms. Similarly refraction. The actual mechanism of why they are as they are; their physical properties is a question of an empirical science; and not of his philosophy. 

One should distinguish between the representation (declaration) of truth and truth itself. Perhaps this is as true in love as it is in philosophy. Plato touches upon this in his dialogue (or philosophical play) the Symposium. A Symposium now means an academic conference - then it meant a drinking party. They (amongst them Socrates) are in the male chambers at the house of Agathon, a playwright. Seven participants are asked to discourse and eulogise on love in turn. Aristophanes first skips his turn as he had a bout of hiccups, when this passes he expresses a little nervousness. He says: 

I don't follow your argument. Legs were an evolutionary adaption so humans could move about the surface of the earth. Now that we have cars should we abandon our legs? If morality is an evolutionary adaptation, seeing that it has taken as long as language to evolve it behoves us to keep it. In fact if you take the argument from evolution seriously we don't have any choice about the matter. We have it in the same way as we have our legs or our instinct from language. What you're arguing for is an adaptation of morality to take into account changing circumstances. Not losing it. An analogy might help, if you move to China, you may decide to lose your ability to speak English & acquire the ability to speak Chinese. But in no way have you lost your instinct for language which is the essential component of language for humans as an evolutionary acquisition. Chomsky argues for this as 'deep grammar' and being biologically determined, and hence evolutionarily determined. There is no teleology to evolution when you talk of evolution for-itself. But this doesn't mean that teleology goes away - as is commonly & popularly thought, it affirms itself as a question at a different level and context. 

The labyrinth is of course the inescapable lair of the mythical minotaur and was killed by the Greek hero Theseus. He is helped by the monsters half-sister Ariadne who guides him out of the labyrinth via a thread she had tied to him. This is the reverse of the North European folk-tale Sleeping Beauty where the prince wakes the princess. Of course both are tales of sexual awakening, of love and of socialisation to the adult world. Jung said, to lose Ariadnes thread, is to lose the thread to life. Borges, the Argentinian writer, in The House of Asterion, expands the myth by expanding the labyrinth to take on the proportions of the entire universe, Asterion (the Minoan name for the Minotaur) himself has forgotten he has created the labyrinth - he wanders it, lost - and looking forward to death, his redeemer; which does come as Theseus. He remarks to Ariadne later, before he abandons her in Naxos for her sister, 'that the Minotaur hardly defended himself'. Borges is writing here about the death of the Christian God and skillfuly inverts Christian narrative of Man being redeemed by God, of God being redeemed by Man. 

Which directly recalls the notion of an atom as that which has no parts; parts meaning being seperable; but not distinguishable. For Euclid, a line is not made up of points as we understand it; it is a synthetic object. Points mark the ends of a line or where one line crosses another; they are markers of position. Hence, one can feasibly say that the first synthesis of lines and points is to conceive lines as points. Now a particle is simply a point in motion; and a wave is a line in motion. Concieved as points, a wave is just particles moving up and down; this might conceivably called the first synthesis of particles and waves. But what about QM? After QM, physics began to posit extended objects - vortices, strings and branes; one might say they began to explore the possibility that conceiving particles as points was the basic mistake - a mistake that can be traced to The Euclidean definition of a point. The first atomists were clear that their atoms had extension since they were modelled as Platonic solids; so, in a sense we've returned to an older tradition. So yes; the point is, that points aren't simply points; that they don't have extension or parts; but that they have extension. Aristotle pointed out that the actual infinite could not physically exist; but he did admit infinite divisibility; but this isn't the infinitely small; and the contrary appears to be true; that the infinitely small does not either in any aspect, be it space, time, matter or energy, exist; doing so leads to errors. 

And thus (in the monist interpretation) no causality and no change; but more precisely we might say that causality is not, and that change is not. After all, this coffee cup before me is but neither is it experiencing change; so it has no change; but this is different from a non-existent coffee cup which by its very sense cannot experience change; so one might say change is not (by analogy to the expression of Parmenides); and again by analogy, that causality is not. But he also argued that Being itself has no causality and no change. Now, Hegel argued that Being and non-Being are equivalent, in a sense Now, if causality and change are not essences, We might venture that they are in a sense, essential properties. We might venture also, if all essential properties are in common, then by analogy (if not by predicate) that they are the same; but not in the sense of identical. Does this follow a standard interpretation of the opening of Hegels logic where he states that:
