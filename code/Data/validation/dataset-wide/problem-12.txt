The whole point here is that we deliberately split two parts of the brain. This allows the development of two somewhat independent persona as the links that define them as one have been broken. But that seems an unlikely development in a healthy creature. You'd essentially have something like Siamese twins if such a thing happened. It's not impossible that the entity could function (we've seen many cases of these cojoined twins living long lives), but the level of compromise required would be extreme and it's unlikely to be a useful survival trait. Being a useful survival trait is pretty much the defining factor for whether an adaption becomes the norm or not. 

This is meaningless. You've removed basic infrastructure required to operate a technological society and essential just to maintain lives. What hypothetical technologies could exist that don't require basics like electrical power and transport logistics to be effective ? And who would develop, maintain and operate this technology ? Certainly not the starving, dying population suffering without any modern medical aids. 

No. Steam became key to the industrial revolution for a simple reason : coal was being mined and coal mines needed pumps driven by a readily available fuel - i.e. by coal. Steam engines grew in sophistication and in application from that point, but it was the combination of a need for a steady automated action (pumping) and a readily available fuel (no processing required for coal !) that made it take off. Alcohol is a different thing entirely. You don't find e.g. alcohol lakes conveniently located next to a place you need to do some kind of mechanically repeatable task (like pumping). You don't even find alcohol located in underground reservoirs. You have to manufacture alcohol. It needs lots of supplies brought to one place and lots of transport to move the alcohol from where you make it to where you need it (not always the same). You ideally needs lots of e.g. coal to fuel the production of alcohol and it's transportation. And note there's a big difference between making alcohol as in beer and wine and making alcohol as in high purity spirits. And there a similar difference in burning them as fuel. That's not the same as coal driven stream engines. You start from a need with the easily available fuel and as soon as you get it working it will be refined and improved and new applications become obvious. And finally of course, it's a sinful waste in an era when alcohol was important as a safe (hygienic !) liquid to drink and water usually was not ! And in that sense alcohol did fuel the industrial worker for a long time, although not so much the industrial revolution. :-) 

It's very hard to be specific, but consider that the night sky you want to emulate - a human night sky - is actually constantly changing anyway. The sky changes over the course of minutes (rotation of earth) and days (movement of earth). As humans we are adapted to changing sky already. So with the exception of those passengers interested in astronomy, no-one will probably care about a changing night sky. Where the problem might arise if if you're traveling at relativistic velocities and then you may experience more extreme views of the outside. Now that would be strange to the generations that are not used to it, but the generations that grow up in it will not care - for them it will be the normal sky. The main thing you need, as a human, is visual clues as to the day-night cycle. If you try and live outside and apart from these you will experience health problems - your body needs a day-night cycle. But that doesn't require an emulation of a night sky, just an emulation of a day-night illumination cycle. So overall I see no real issue with the night sky and no reason to emulate one. To be honest the biggest issue with generation ships is simply getting people to leave what is, for the final generation, their home. How to incentivize them to get off the ship ? But that's a different issue ... 

Modern fleets and nations require serious qualifications for all officers, including Captains. Typically you're required to have academic qualifications of a specific nature at something equivalent to Bachelor's Degree level and have a lot of experience in the roles leading to Captain, as well as all the paper qualifications required for those roles. It would be the equivalent of several years work (that's voyage time, not employment time). If you don't have these things no serious shipping operation would hire you and no government or insurance company would permit you on a ship in any capacity as a responsible officer. And don't underestimate the power of insurance companies in this - uninsured ships and cargo are not an viable option for anyone in business. Wikipedia gives some guidance but it does vary somewhat. Some more info here. Prior experience from the 1500's would probably be next to useless to gain these things. Your 1500's sea captain would probably have to start again from the most junior levels and qualify. It's possible if he had a natural talent for this it might help a little, but the formal systems in place mean the formal qualifications and working time requirements are basically not optional. More to the point, your 16th century Captain would have enormous trouble adapting just to life in the 21st century. I suspect they'd be overwhelmed (just as we would if we had to live in the 16th century). Culture shock would kill them, as like as not. 

If gravitons exist (which is not proven or even certain at this point), the only way to manipulate then gravitational field (which is still what you're trying to do) is to manipulate the energy density (which includes mass) in space. In (extreme) principle you could manipulate the energy density to space time locally and variably. However to do this you would use other forces (e.g. EM fields) not directly using gravity. The practical reality is that if you could use other forces to manipulate gravity locally, it would be far easier to use the same forces to directly affect the object you want to move. This would also require less energy to do as gravity is a relatively weal force (and this won't change because you try adding extra dimensions where gravity is strong, as this won't affect the energy required to affect matter in your "everyday" dimensions - it just means you're wasting lots of energy in other dimensions). Incidentally, levitation is harder than throwing. Throwing something requires nothing more that a single directed impulse. It requires limited precision. Levitation requires a continuous application of precise force to counteract normal gravity. You might picture this as the difference between kicking a plate away and balancing one on a stick. Which is harder ? 

You're confusing a vague description to cover some moments of dialog with an explanation of a technology. An example of what's wrong with your thinking : a lump of metal surrounded by a little explosive. That's a summary of a nuclear weapon, but it tells you nothing at all about the underlying technology or how it really works. Or describe a computer or smart phone in two short sentences. 

If all I need to do is make my machines complicated, these guys are dead. There are people out there who love making complicated devices and some of them like making complicated killing machines. Drones - high altitude, practically invisible, armed with anything up to and including Nukes. I don't see any way a limited number of Wizards can win long term. The numbers would be whittled down and it is, by definition, a group where replacing experts is time consuming and difficult, so even a small number of high level kills will reduce their ability to function and be a serious threat. Low and middle ranking wizards probably wouldn't be any more of a real threat than a determined non-wizard terrorist. And high level ones will try to avoid being detected as they're potentially vulnerable to attacks in numbers and, hey, don't high level leaders usually like to stay safe ? So no more of a real threat that any terrorist group, IMO. 

The number you are describing would not, ever, be done by detailed calculation, but by some sort of empirical rule of thumb guess-work formula. It's the sort of number politicians like and technocrats actually have utter disdain for, because the number is useless in and off itself. The number provides no information on the nature of the problem and no idea at all how to solve it. It distracts from the problem itself and it uses resources to make it which could be better spent elsewhere. 

If you want them to have armor that is highly polished and highly reflective then a simply covering over the regular armor would seem more practical. After all, while you want them to look nice, it's also important that for those hopefully rare occasions when they venture forth to hit people that they have real armor that stops such trivia as bullets, shrapnel and (my personal favorite) your basic club-with-a-nail-in-it. So you would give them an inner layer that takes the hits and some very expendable easy replaced spiffy mirror finish material as an overall-style uniform. If you're mainly interested in mirrored head gear then you can actually use a normal mirror technique if you can get some very tough transparent plastic (transparent aluminum anyone ? :-) ). In a normal mirror you just spray the mirror finish onto glass. I suppose a full body armor suit of the same type is equally possible. 

I would say this is the least economic approach for a small country (and I come from such a country). It's more likely they'd build a deck designed for STOLs using a ramp or simply build a helicopter based small carrier. Conversion from an existing vessel is perfectly feasible (and exactly what was common in the early days of carrier development). The question which arises is what purpose does it have ? If you're insisting on building a jet-equipped carrier strike force then you're asking for a huge budget just to operate the jets, keep trained pilots and crews and adding to that with a hideously expensive flattop. This is utterly pointless in military terms, as there's no support vessels to protect this thing and keep it active. If you're building some sort of mobile air support platform you don't generally need a large vessel. A single modern helicopter is quite a lethal strike force if properly armed and equipped. Again, what protects my small mobile carrier ? What maintains it ? This is a huge cost and what benefit is it ? Any large country can probably wipe out my carrier in no time flat with any combination of air power, sea power and even cruise missiles. And another small country is going to impressed by the waste of money better spent on conventional arms to defend the country. A single missile cruiser or destroyer with short or medium range missiles would be far more lethal in practice and more economic. Even some moderately sized fast patrol boats armed with missiles would be quite effective and much more economic and flexible for a small country. So this doesn't strike me as a useful vessel to have. It diverts resources from more useful military projects and has no credibility as a threat against anyone who'd threaten.
