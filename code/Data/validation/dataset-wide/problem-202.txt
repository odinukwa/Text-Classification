A terrorist group threatens to start a runaway greenhouse effect by releasing tetrafluoromethane into the atmosphere. How much gas do they need to do that on earth? 

A small device, the size of a grain of rice, is implanted in a number of individuals to track their movement. These individuals are usually compliant but being tracked is also not exactly in their interest. For this reason the organization decided to place the implant in a body part that makes extraction difficult/dangerous at least for an amateur. On the other hand they do not want for the set up procedure to be too much of a hassle. What is a good place in the human body for such a device? Insertion should be possible without anesthetic (local is allowed) and treated individuals should require no hospitalization. Location must not pose a threat over long term and limbs are not allowed. EDIT: My question is hardly a duplicate of the provided question. That question revolves more around security features and NONE of the answers provided deal with the location (what I asked) of such a device in any meaningful way. 

As AndyD273 stated, there are many factors to consider. Having elements shield each others is very inefficient, that's why most Dyson swarms feature statites, they do not cast shadows onto each others and can collect light from the entire surface of the star. If you want to stick with orbiting elements then you must design orbits that lie on different "planes" each perpendicular to at least other two, like this. In this way it doesn't really matter how distant your habitat is from the star or how large the elements are, the number of yearly "nights" is equal to twice the number of orbits that lie closer to the star than yours. So if your habitat lies on the second closer orbit from the star they will experience two very short nights every "year" (orbit); if they are on the third closer orbit they will have 4 nights, on the fourth 6 nights and so on. Nights are equally sparsed throughout the year, so if a year is 200 days and your habitat is on the third orbit they will experience 4 nights a year each every 50 days. The nights all last the same time and are probably very short; their duration depends on orbital velocity. Consider that if you want artificial gravity you will need to spin your habitat unless it is massive enough to have its own gravity (this would create additional day/night cycles). Statite elements, on the other hand, don't need to spin to have gravity even if they are not massive enough, but you need to live on the dark side. 

This creature is a waterdweller that somewhat resemble a fish. It lives in the retreating oceans of a planet orbiting a star that is reaching its red giant stage. The planet is now experiencing very high levels of radiation and life is becoming extinct... The creature is a photosynthetic animal so it needs to live close to the surface of the oceans but they lay eggs at the bottom of the oceans to protect their youngs. The youngs eventually develop a strong armour once reaching maturity and lose their fins. The grownups are basically rocks, they do not have the ability to move any appendages since their thick and solid exoskeleton. They have the ability to move around thanks to a bio-MHD in the bioMHD the electric current is passed thanks through stacked cells like those of an electric eel. How can I generated the magnetic field to push the water through? 

Fossils Fossils are petrified bones/tissues, sometimes even complete creatures. Your Gorgon shoots Tachions out of its eyes that concentrate the timespan of a few million years in an instant, causing the victim to be petrified on the spot (not sure where the mineral come from though) metastable ice I remember reading this in a sci-fi story. A metastable form of ice is found that solidifies at room temperature; it also has the ability to catalize its own formation from oher allotropes of ice or even water(much like a prion). So when the Gorgon sprays brine of this ice on the target, they quickly cristallize, frozen in place. Bonus: The Gorgon shoots a mist with high concentration of THC on the target; "stoning" them right where they stand. 

In this dystopian world, ruled by a plutocracy, everyone experience life on surrogates. Due to very intense and effective advertising, ANYTHING can be sold, including stuff we really don't need (a bit like today??); The inhabitants live their life on surrogates. In such an environment, what could be a surrogate for things like food, sleep or sex? When I say surrogate I mean something that replaces these things in the same way a place like facebook or tumblr can be considered a surrogate for real social interactions. Obviously one should take nutriment and rest from food and sleep surrogates respectively, but they must not be "the real deal". 

In my world there are androids. These robots are completely human-looking, you cannot tell them apart from a real person by looking at them, inspecting their bodies etc. To attain this they need some mimikry of human physiology. Making a skeleton is easy but what about muscles? Muscles are probably the most evident feature other than the skin. Are there artificial muscles that can mimik humans' in terms of appearence? They must feel like muscles; squisy, no clanking sounds, strong enough to at least move the body of the robot. I do not care how they look like (they are covered by the skin) 

Use Ricin, or, even better, a similar protein. Ricin is a toxic protein produced by Ricinus communis. It is toxic if ingested and therefore does not leave any injection mark. It has the effect of blocking protein synthesis and is therefore toxic to every cell type. Depending on doses it can kill in hours or a few days. It's historically been used for assassiantion and therefore its synptoms are well known, however: Synptoms may vary from person to person, also, it is possible that a purer for of the protein may have fewer symptoms there are no common clinical tests for Ricin poisoning, bu it can be detected in 2 ways, DNA amplification and antibodies essays. What to do then? Use a different protein. There are many protein similar to Ricin, Abrin for example is lethal at even lower concentration which makes detection harder; even better you can DESIGN a different protein. Use genetic engineering to remove the part of the protein that binds to the antibodies so that it won't be detected with antibodies essays and instead of extracting it from the beans express it in a vector and then purify it(in this way the DNA detection won't find any traces) 

Guests of this large space station enjoy Earth-like gravity (80-90% minimum). How? Well the space station is so massive it has its own gravity. The disk shaped "core" is made with ultradense materials with an overall of 20-30 g/cm3 similar to Iridium or Osmium (the densest elements). I thought that working with material with such density could provide decent gravity with relatively little amount of material so I tried crunching some numbers... Turns out I suck at math. How massive/large does a disk with these density have to be to provide similar gravitational pull close to its surface? (Ignore edge effects and the core does not have to keep its own atmosphere, even if you can just provide some formulas it would be great since right now I don't have much time for this) 

A K2+ civilization wants to build a fission star, a huge mass of fissile material which doesn't collapse due to the radiation emitted by its fission decay. I know there are reactors like the aqueous homogeneous reactor that are self regulating and even naturally occurring reactors exist, so why not a star? So basically can I make a self sustaining, spherical, homogeneous fission reactor? I don't care how big it is, for how long does it shines, if it's solid, liquid, gas or plasma, it's also ok if it needs to contains other elements (moderator?) to exist. It's a K2+ so resources are not a problem! 

ArtificialSoul gave a great answer. But there might be another way. The planet could rotate really fast, like REALLY REALLY fast. Obviously centripetal forces would tear it apart unless... the planet is also really really massive. Being massive and dense would negate the requirement that the planet has similar surface gravity to Earth, however you could make it so that at the equator the combination of centripetal forces and gravity gave out at least an apparent Earth gravity. I'm not sure this extreme Mesklin-like planet could physically exist (let alone naturally develop), I might come back later with the math when I have time, I didn't really give it much though. If possible, only the equator could be habitable, with gravity increasing and time dilation decreasing the more you move toward the poles. No freaking idea what the sky would look like, or what the consequences of having part of the planet age faster than others. Will think about it 

1) Antigravity! Just handwave the problem away! 2) Live deep underground where the gravity drops to 1g, you will need a way to counter the extreme pressure 3) Live in a gravity train; you can build a gravity train at an angle that will give the occupants 1g gravity constantly MASSIVE ENGINEERING REQUIRED: 4) Live above ground, but not in orbit, just build a supraworld on top of many space fountains and you're done 5) Spin the hell out of the planet and live on the equator after you corrected the apparent gravity to 1g 6) Suspend a superdense mass above you colony using space fountains or a space elevator, then live directly below it 7) Build your colony on an orbital ring, have it revolve at suborbital speed to get 1g gravity on the surface of the colony
