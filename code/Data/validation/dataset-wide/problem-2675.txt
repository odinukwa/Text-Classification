As commenters have pointed out, your question could use a lot of clarity concerning what is meant by "an infinite" and "differentiated". Nevertheless, I will push back on one of the examples you have given, namely that of the infinite line. Yes, the line must necessarily be understood to consists of different points - if it were just one point, well, it would be a point, not a line, and would not in any usual sense of the word be understood as infinite. However, I contend that the points that constitute the line are indistinguishable, or as you seem to put it, undifferentiated. "Now," you would say, "surely the points on the line are differentiated? For we say that this point is at x=0, this one at x=1, etc." Well, we label them like such only after we choose an entirely arbitrary system of labels (namely, a coordinate system with an arbitrary point as its coordinate origin x=0). As a purely geometrical object, a line is a line even before we conceive of coordinate systems. We can understand a line without any reference to coordinate systems or equivalent notions - per Euclid, an infinite straight line is a "breadthless length...which lies evenly with the points on itself" and extends without cessation in either direction. This is also reflected in the fact that historically, the notion of a line predates the notion of a coordinate system. To explicate this further, we could pick "this" point or "that" point as the coordinate origin x=0, and the line would look exactly the same. For, since the line is straight, we could only tell the two situations apart by measuring the (signed) distance from the origin to a point that we knew was "the same" in both cases; but before we imposed the coordinate system there was nothing to label said point by, and we couldn't possibly tell that it was the same in both cases! Thus, I think that the sense of "an infinite" and "differentiated" used above, yes, an infinite can be undifferentiated. 

the arguments against Objectivism are mostly from people who don't understand Objectivism. but an actual issue with Objectivism is induction. induction has logical problems as explained by Karl Popper and many others. Rand knew that she couldn't explain how induction worked and defend it in detail, but she still mistakenly assumed that it works somehow. 

you should survey some important philosophies and get involved with highly critical philosophy discussion. criticism is necessary to find errors. one of the main problems with philosophy is lots of people have a bunch of bullshit ideas and don't realize all the problems with their ideas. the list of philosophies you take a look at should include Objectivism (Ayn Rand) and Critical Rationalism (Karl Popper) in addition to stuff like artistotle and kant which everyone recommends (i think they're bad, but you decide). the only very good philosophy discussion forum i'm aware of is $URL$ (this is a Q&A site, which is a different structure with advantages and disadvantages. it's fine but it's different than open-ended discussion where people just chat and argue) 

if you have no training, trying to rescue a drowning person with no equipment in deep water is actually dangerous. they aren't thinking straight and may drown you. but let's assume rescuing them is only a tiny risk. then go ahead. life is full of risks. if you ride in a car you could die in a car crash. trying to avoid all risk would be silly. you don't need a big benefit to accept a tiny risk. it's up to you if you want to rescue them. if you value human life, then that's a reason to do it since you want to see the guy healthy. if you like people in general, and you have a way to be a big help to someone at a low cost, then you can do it, go ahead. there's nothing in Objectivism to outlaw this (nor strictly mandate it. but Objectivists respect human life. so if it's a tiny cost, well, can't you afford it? Objectivists ought to be productive and be able to afford tiny costs to promote their values.). it's great to look for opportunities to trade mutual benefit in general. if you had more time maybe you'd ask him to pay you $10 to help. but you're in a hurry. you could ask him afterwards. i bet he'd give you $10 if you really care, or perhaps he'll volunteer some other reward for you. but $10 is so small compared to a life that it's not a big concern here, nor is the $10 of effort and risk this cost you. (it depends on the scenario parameters. if it costs you $5000 of effort and risk, then that could harm your own life, and he might not pay you back after you save him, so you have to consider what you want to do.) 

I will attempt to create a philosophy of stupidness here in this post. Let us start from a simple question - is there stupidity? From billions of good and not so good answers we arrive at the conclusion that stupidity DOES exist. Second, let us continue with the question - is there NO stupidity? From billions of good and not so good answers we arrive at the conclusion that stupidity does NOT exist. On this solid ground i base my philosophy of stupidity. Stupidity is a fundamental ingredient of the universe which both exist and does not exist. Stupidity is very closely linked to the question of existence of others. When others do not exist they become stupid, because only existence brings light. On the other hand when others start to exist they can not be stupid, because only existence brings light. Same fundamental method applies to God. If he exists he can not be stupid. On the other hand if God does not exist then he is stupid because he could not achieve existence. After that brilliant discoveries i also see dual connection between stupidity and existence. When existence is there stupidity is not, and when stupidity is there existence is not. Right from here it becomes clear that sleep is stupid because it deprives us from existence. Furthermore my philosophy of stupidness offers a correct interpretation of classical philosophers. For example famous Descartes - "Cogito ergo sum" really means - "I exist therefor i am not stupid" My philosophy of stupidity is so fundamental (stupid, as a dual counterpart to existence) that it even applies to itself. When others reject my philosophy it proves how correct it is, on the other hand when others accept it it deprives it from the object of study. Stupidity is so fundamental that i had to base my philosophy of it on it itself . That is why it is clearly visible that in some parts of the text author is there and in others we lost him. 

Your teacher is wrong. Firstly, note that the presence or absence of a problem has nothing whatsoever to do with the MWI - what is being described could happen in this universe, without recourse to the MWI, it would just be astronomically improbable. However, if this series of events were truly a paradox, it would have to be strictly impossible, and so the problem would be present or absent whether the series of events is astronomically improbable as is the case without MWI or whether it the series of events is virtually certain to occur as is the case when we consider all possible worlds in the multiverse in MWI. Thus, we can entirely disentangle the MWI from this question. Now, the resolution of the apparent paradox is hinted at in the question you ask in point 2). An information paradox occurs if we can reliably communicate information back in time. By assumption, the series of events we describe doesn't constitute that - it occurs purely by random chance. To see this more clearly, suppose instead that in the year 2000 I walked into a door (could be a door to a funky contraption that looks like a time machine, or it could just be a regular door to a library) carrying the complete works of Shakespeare (I don't even dematerialise as I walk through, I continue and exit on the other side just fine), and in the year 1999 I walked out of a door carrying the complete works of Shakespeare (once again I had walked in normally, no magic materialisation happening here either). Has an information paradox occurred in this scenario? Have I transmitted the works of Shakespeare back in time? "Of course not," you say, "but the situations are fundamentally different - the alleged time-traveller I described dematerialised in the future, and materialised in the past." But, so what? The dematerialisation/materialisation events are far more improbable than the walking in/walking out of a door events, but they are not fundamentally any different - both are due to random fluctuations and in both cases the works of Shakespeare were present at a future time and present at a past time, one is just far more likely to occur than the other. But clearly, in the second case we would not suggest that any information has been transmitted back in time. The apparent contradiction stems from our thinking that just because certain random fluctuations are possible in our universe they are properly "caused" by the laws of our universe. That is not to say that events in a universe with probabilistic laws are totally randomly caused - we have compelling evidence that they follow particular, albeit probabilistic, laws. Rather, you can think of a series events having two causal elements - reliable, definite, physical laws, which determine a probability distribution of series of possible events, and then a random element that selects from this distribution. For information to be transmitted reliably from event A to event B, event A must through the physical laws affect the probability distribution element of B's cause in a way that makes it highly likely for that information to emerge at event B. This is clearly not what is happening in either case above. Event A - which in the first case is the dematerialisation of the alleged time-traveller in the future with the complete works of Shakespeare, and in the second case is me walking in to a door with the complete works of Shakespeare - has, as per the physical laws of our universe (relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.), no bearing whatsoever on the probability distribution element of the cause of event B - which in the first case is the materialisation of the alleged time-traveller in the past with the complete works of Shakespeare, and in the second case is me walking out of a door with the complete works of Shakespeare. These just happen for unrelated reasons - in the first case, sheer random chance causes the highly improbable materialisation event to occur, and in the second case some unrelated set of causes (having to do with me being a perennial bookworm) lying strictly in the past of event B shape the probability distribution, making it likely for me to walk out of the door with the complete works of Shakespeare. In either case, no information is transferred from event A to event B, and there is no information paradox. 

check your premises about who is intelligent. anyway, the underlying issue is people disagree about stuff. there are lots of ideas out there. many of them conflict. sorting it out is hard. being intelligent and reasonable in no way prevents someone from making a mistake when judging some ideas that disagree. it's hard. a secondary issue is that people have bad methods of judging ideas. they're bad at discussing hard issues to conclusions. they don't really know how and they kinda wing it and mistakes are common. if anyone would like to improve at this, a good place to start is this book $URL$ or this discussion forum $URL$ 

what else? the broader goal is to seek out criticisms of Popper, Rand and others that don't suck, and define some criteria for "don't suck" that will be acceptable on this site. 

What objective criteria can be used to judge philosophical refutations? Say for example that someone is writing a criticism of Karl Popper. What are ways to reject the criticism without getting into a detailed debate of the sort that this site doesn't allow? 

No empirical falsification is ever decisive whether the theory is probabilistic or not. Popper discussed this, e.g. section 29 of LScD "THE RELATIVITY OF BASIC STATEMENTS". the basic issue, also known as the duhem-quine problem, is whenever you have a refutation either the refuted theory is wrong OR the refutation itself could be wrong, so it's never totally clear, decisive and settled. So what do you do instead? You criticize and stop seeking certainty. You try to find bad ideas and reject them. Does it makes sense? Any logical issues? Does it solve the problem it's supposed to solve? Does it cause any problems? You look for good qualities for ideas and things wrong with them. Do your best to think and improve your ideas. Grow your knowledge instead of yearning for final unquestionable answers. This works the same with probabilistic and non-probabilistic theories. 

Here you are slightly abusing logic. 2 omega is not 1 omega by "ABSOLUTE" value they are same by the ORDER of magnitude, which means it is same Type of infinity. So by order of magnitude yes you are correct they will be at the same time. But by "ABSOLUTE" value of time B will be slower. It is a question of a debate/thinking/research how to operate with infinity. Clearly what is possible is to compare ORDER of infinities magnitude but not EXACT absolute value, which based on this example ALSO may exist. 

He is talking about what you can call in modern terms -- spirit. He is saying that connecting(understanding) with the body is the way to comprehend that spirit. Then he is saying that spirit's logic is superior to what you call brain thinking/conventional wisdom. In last sentence he is saying that your body needs actually totally different wisdom than the one you are hearing in your head. That's why people whole life struggle - because REAL wisdom of their life(what is actually going to happen with them) is different from the wisdom they "think/hear/bear/perceive" inside their head. Nitzsche wrote that this book is for no one and for everyone. No one means that you will NOT UNDERSTAND (even if you think you did) what he said - until you will reach the same level of development. For everyone means that nevertheless you may need to hear what is ahead. Good example - father tells his son that life is hard. Did son understood that life is hard? - No! he does not comprehend yet all the troubles he is about to encounter. But father should tell him about this anyway. 

Let us formulate our question slightly easier. For our sleeping minds. Can a NON omnipotent being create a block that he can not lift and then lift it? Surprising answer is YES. I poor water in my bath and alas it is 120 liters - I can no lift it! Then i walk around in circles year or more discussing with myself how bad and humiliating it is to be a NON omnipotent being. Suddenly, one night i get a vision in a dream about Archimedes lever. I get out, construct a lever and LIFT my bath tube. After this example we can ask ourselves - ARE WE omnipotent or NOT? The big discovery of reason is that WE can NOT tell if we ourselves are NON omnipotent. Most important is that omnipotence with all its glory and countless pleasures asks US very important question - What IS Potence (power in Latin)? Which REAL absolute powers we have? They can be invisibly small but they have to be absolute. PS: from my example it is clear that idea of time is important in reasoning about what can be done (NOW) and what not.
