It's true that this is a simpler analysis than trying to instead account for [b] becoming [p] in a wide range of environments. But, the actual reason why [b] is a variant of [p] is because [p] can occur anywhere, while [b] can only occur in a specific phonetic environment. That is, the voiceless bilabial plosive only becomes voiced when it occurs inter-vocalically, because the voicing of the surrounding vowels carries across to the otherwise voiceless plosive. So, when you start to find phones which seem to be variants of the same sound, you need to look at the environments they occur in to work out which phones have plausibly been affected by the surrounding phones, and which phones seem to be robust in a range of environments. That said, there are languages which permit a lot of 'free variation' (allophones that don't seem to arise through phonetic conditioning), in which case linguists might choose 'the phoneme' based on frequency, ease of explanation, or familiarity with one type of sound over another. But, in many analyses noting 'free variation', there do turn out to be phonetic factors governing the variation. 

While many people use the term double negative to describe languages that require multiple words to be negative without canceling the meaning, really, double negative just describes the presence of two negative words which can happen in both types of languages. The better term to use is negative concord to describe agreement amongst certain words to all be negative or not because that describes what's going on under the surface. Once you have negative concord, you can have a wide number of elements that are negative without changing the meaning and thus getting even tredecuple negation, just like gender agreement in most languages: change one noun and all the adjectives go with it. 

I'd imagine that most languages with a definite/indefinite distinction have the possessive adjectives imply definiteness, with any other forms (via pronouns, etc) allowing for idefiniteness determiners. 

@hippietrail, re: your query about which language the documentation should actually begin in, it's generally thought that your work is most valid if all of the data are collected through the actual language you are documenting. This means that you can either essentially start out 'mute', and learn from scratch, or try to learn some of the language before you start the project. This is all well and good, but for languages that are under-documented (or undocumented), you would be lucky to find sufficient materials available to help you learn the language on your own, before going into the field. So, mostly, people will first learn the lingua franca of the area - if you plan to work on a small native language of Africa, the lingua franca might be Arabic, French, English, or a dominant native language like Kiswahili. And yes, in Australia, the lingua franca might be Kriol. Then, ideally, you'd gradually learn the language you are actually documenting, and use this to verify data you already have, and continue collecting more. In reality, this situation won't always work - it's far more time consuming for the linguist if it's necessary to get an extra language or two under your belt before getting down to the nuts and bolts of documentation, and funding might not always allow for those extra few months as a learner. Not all language documentation entails years spent working on the one language - sometimes an opportunity arises to just work on a language for a short time, or on a specific feature, and it's important to make the most of these opportunities because some documentation is still better than no documentation. In those situations, you might be more likely to end up working with educated speakers who are as fluent in English (or any given language) as you, and that's ok too, as long as you're aware of the possible pitfalls of the 'translation method'. 

There are a number of things that are often cited (and at times disputed) as influences that Basque has had on Castilian. 

I'm not very familiar with the history of Portuguese phonetics, but my guess is that when the palabra huracán was imported in Spanish (being then aspirated, unlike now), when it got to the Portuguese, they likely lacked the sound and so f was probably a pretty good substitute. 

Oftentimes we have documents that talk about how things were pronounced, especially when they criticize people for how they talk (the Romans were rather famous for that). Texts like poems are also very helpful for knowing where words would have similar pronunciations or stresses, and can even help demonstrate sound evolutions despite spelling being the same. On a similar note, inconsistent spellings that suddenly crop in after years of consistency may represent a sound in flux, especially if they later stabilize with the innovated form. Many of those sound changes are relatively consistent across languages, which help confirm those observations (in the sense that we know condition A has resulted in innovation B in unrelated languages due to some known principal C). Finally, we have documents where someone from one language reports on a word from another language and talks about how it sounds in relationship to their language, or more simply a word that gets imported and brings its pronunciation along with it. Taken together, there are generally enough pieces to put together to demonstrate how a language may have sounded with pretty high certainty. If there aren't enough pieces, though, there may be several pronunciations that are consistent with the evidence, and absent more evidence, it may be impossible to know which is the most accurate. 

One example is the evidence for bǎ becoming generalized as a focused object-marker in Chinese. Post suggests that the points noted above: 

Yes, there are some sources comparing Kriol to Torres Strait Creole/Broken. In the 'Handbook of Varieties of English' Vol 1 (Phonology), there is a chapter by Malcolm (2004) 'Australian creoles and Aboriginal English: phonetics and phonology'. You can read some of the chapter here on Google Books, p.656. And in 'Varieties of English' Vol 3 (The Pacific and Australasia), there is another chapter by Malcolm (2008) 'Australian creoles and Aboriginal English: morphology and syntax'. (Sorry, no online content for that one). These chapters together give a really good overview of the features of both creoles, and frame the discussion by topic rather than by creole, so there is plenty of comparison between them. Also, here is a link to a (quite dated) paper with some earlier comparisons between the two creoles, by Sandefur (1986). See pages 19-24. 

The only way in English is to switch to an alternate structure. Ditto in the Romance languages, which language depending have different ways of adjusting structure so that the possessive adjective (if it stays as an adjective) loses its determinative prowess. 

The above is summarized from “La influencia del sustrato euskera en hispano-romance” (Mary C. Irtbarren-Argaiz). She goes into great detail evaluating the claims and sourcing them, some of which she doesn't necessarily agree with, but I've included some of the alternate views she mentions. 

In English (and certainly in the Romance languages, and similar to what Tim Osborne mentions with older German), when you use the possessive adjective as a determiner, the noun is treated as definite: 

Also, a French questions I don't know the answer to. Does pas require ne? If so, and you wish to exclude ungrammatical phrases, you will need to set up a rather large alternate pattern. 

In a way, yes. The thing about mass nouns is that the things they refer to are usually inherently plural/collective/inseparable, like flour, milk, dust, and grass. Those things are most commonly encountered or discussed as, well, masses of a given substance, rather than individual pieces of said substance. So, it would be somewhat unusual for a language to explicitly mark the 'mass' form of a mass noun, because that would suggest that 'a drop of milk' is the run-of-the mill, everyday way of talking about milk, while 'many drops of milk as one mass' needs to be explicitly indicated because your audience couldn't assume that's what you meant. In effect, you would end up with a similar system to the singular vs. plural marking that happens for count nouns, and it would erode an existing distinction between mass nouns and count nouns. So instead, what some languages do is mark the singulative form of a mass noun, which means basically that there is a marked form of the noun to indicate when it is a piece/part of the unmarked mass noun. In English, we can only do this in a roundabout way: a grain of rice vs. rice, but if we had a singulative marker, say *-op, we could just say *ricop and rice, in the same way as in Bari, you have lɛ-tat 'a drop of milk' and lɛ 'milk'. A system like this means that, although the mass form of the mass noun is unmarked, mass nouns have their own specific morphology as opposed to count nouns, so are easily distinguished from count nouns (unlike in English, where mass nouns don't take any special morphemes). Singulative marking is encountered as part of the tripartite number marking patterns found in many Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo languages. A tripartite number system exhibits three principles of number indication, namely pluralisation, singulativisation, and substitution of number morphemes, as discussed in this paper on Western Nilotic noun morphology by Storch (2007). Here is an example from Anywa (Anuak) from Reh 1996 but reproduced by Storch: 

It would really help you out if you write things out with /x which ignores whitespace. Using it allows you to document your regex which helps find inefficiencies in it and also ways to improve it. Here's what you have (I've not escaped the actual spaces you encoded, but it should give you an idea of how much easier it is to read). 

It certainly comes up occasionally, but mainly, I would think, across morpheme boundaries where one is a doubled letter and the other is that same letter but in its singular form (as in the new German orthography Schifffahrt, Balletttänzer, etc) or where a letter has both consonant and vowel values. Undoubtedly at some point uvula and any other words with uvu would in the past have been written identically until the separation of the v from u (if someone could find an old print reference to a vuvuzela then you'd have a quadruple u). But I would imagine most languages (happy to be corrected, of course) would start to simplify spelling if the extra letters don't change pronunciation, or add in punctuation to separate them (as in shell-less in English) 

The idea that literacy may slow the process of language change has been around for a while, but as far as I know there is no comprehensive study of this, partly because there are lots of issues with finding groups which are otherwise comparable except for literacy rates. There is a key paper on the topic called Literacy as a Factor in Language Change (Zengel 1962) which hypothesizes about this but doesn't actually provide any real evidence for it - Zengel is basically surprised by the higher-than-expected rate of retention of vocabulary items in a small sample of English and Latin over 1000 years, and suggests that this could be because literacy was primary and integral in these languages and therefore added extra stability. This study excluded natural phonetic change and structural change in the words because, of course, this was rampant, so Zengel just looked at word stems. (A glance at just about any English sentence is good evidence for the fact that sound change stampedes on ahead, regardless of spelling systems). Some arguments against the literacy-slows-change idea are contained in Chapter 3 of this book on Literacy and Lexical Diffusion. It's an accessible discussion, basically arguing that literacy actually introduces rapid and widespread language change, and that literacy itself is diverse and variable rather than uniform and stable. Furthermore, even in so-called literate cultures, widespread literacy is generally still a relatively recent phenomenon. An additional point to think about is all of the types of changes that can be observed in English usage through the use of new digital mediums of communication - these occur very rapidly, directly mediated by literacy. 

It becomes obvious where to add fenceop's suggestion of (?: \w+\b)* in here (I'd also add on an extra otherwise if you have two que/qu' it will gobble up all but the last one), but first some things you can improve on: In the first group, notice that both of the initial two options include a group which is followed by (exactly 0 or 1 times). This means it can also match nothing at all. You can just put the at the end of the entire first capture group. Also, you have a space after each element in the nested options (for pronouns). You can just put this after all of them. Likewise, no need for parentheses. For for single letter options, character classes are much more readable and common, so you can change to . So can be trimmed down to . But since \w is just a default collect if not the ones you've specified, you can drop it even further to a single set of options rather than needing to nest it. But then again, since \w+ would match the others, you can just have \w+. I don't think that's what you want, though. In the the group with the verb conjugation, again, character classes are nice and the (ez) does nothing but add a capture group. Presuming you actually meant to include the word boundary after all of them, you can just use that after the options group. So can be trimmed down to . Also, some other improvements: using to try to match a sequence of letters will fail if there's any punctuation which I believe in French is quite rather common. You may wish to specify your own character as (adding in accented variants needed for French, hyphen must go at the very end or very beginning), or just use which is a non-white space character. For what you're doing, there's probably no harm in using in place of . With the number of non-capturing groups you have, you might want to instead use named capture groups and just ignore all other results, but that's me personally. Given my suggestions you will get using /x (again, spaces not fully escaped), I'd recommend something closer to this (using named captures pre, neg1, verb, pron, neg2, and extra — extra will contain the text you have in bold):
