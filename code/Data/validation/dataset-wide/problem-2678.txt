Assert that it arose by random chance. (this is actually the case in reality often enough, it is known as genetic drift) The challenge with this option is explaining how it arose by chance despite being unlikely. If you succeed, then you can expect that removing the feature, or at least replacing it with an alternate version will have no effect (for example, it doesn't really affect your life if you are capable of rolling your tongue or not). Assert that it evolved. There are two challenges. The first is to explain how individuals which possessed the feature reproduced more rapidly than those who did not. The second is to explain the same for every intermediate form, because evolution happens in small steps - it is not enough to show that having wings is better than not having wings, you must also show that having wing stumps is better than not having them, because the wing had to have come from "somewhere". If you succeed, you can predict what problems having a defect in that feature will create, and after building a large enough database of such defects, you can then take any defect and immediately narrow down its cause to a handful of features known to lead to it. You can also suggest how to improve the feature further. 

Without knowing, you may come to believe that a feature came to be to achieve a goal, when in reality it has no function ("why do men have nipples?"). You will then end up chasing after "red herrings" when looking for causes of effects. You will be puzzled why seemingly desirable features do not exist ("why don't animals have wheels?"). You will assume that every feature is "as good as it gets", and then you will be surprised when some of them later manage to get better. You will accept as true some fantastical explanations which are impossible because the intermediate forms are too unfit, since you will assume that nature will "grin and bear it" through those "tough times" of very low fitness "for the sake of" the final outcome with very high fitness. (more broadly, this problem is known as "climbing a hill" in optimization) 

This distinction occurs a decent amount of times; being described with the terms 'positive' and 'negative' rights. A brief descriptor from Stanford Encyclopedia (scroll down a bit more, its at 2.1.8) sheds some light on it. Positive rights must be enforced by other people. If I have a positive right to be fed, then others must feed me in order to meet some sort of moral obligation. Negative rights are defined by lack of action. If I have a negative right to be fed, then others cannot interfere with my eating but are not morally obligated to feed me. Cass Sunstein and Holmes lean towards a more liberal approach towards positive rights in their short essay The Cost of Rights. I'm not too familiar with Holmes, but Sunstein has written a lot of good books concerning political applications of this type of philosophy. Objectivist and libertarian philosophy (Ayn Rand with academic rigor, not her stories which are interesting none-the-less) would probably lean towards the idea of negative rights. Hope this leads to some good directions! 

From my own limited knowledge of philosophy of science I believe this to be a reason to prefer ideas which have some type of experimental backing over ideas which have none. Experiment A offers data that we can infer supports a Idea A but has no bearing on Idea B. While our inference may be factually wrong, it would be logically better to support Idea A because it may eventually become falsified, while Idea B can never be falsified because it has no experiments which to reference. Idea B is almost in logical limbo due to a lack of support or falsification The experiment being false has no bearing on Idea B, while it has bearing on Idea A. Inferences connect the experimental conclusion to the ideas. My interpretation of the quote almost lends to the idea that it is better to believe in ideas which have been supported by falsification than it is to believe in ideas which have no reference to any experimental data or inferences at all. 

I do not know Sanskrit, but from the context and nature of the discussion taking place, I do not believe that corruption here means 'sexualy fallen'. This sounds like a modern and rather coarse interpretation, put forward by someone what fails to recognize what is undoubtedly a metaphorical reference. I will attempt 'transpose' from Judaic Kabbalistic tradition, with which I am intimately familiar. Many scholars consider this tradition closely related to Hinduism - either derived therefrom or springing from the same source: In very general terms, 'women', the feminine principle, represent 'Earth' - the physical manifestation and implementation of the stage God erected to afford Man the opportunity to Act. 'when women are corrupted': when the tenets of 'the natural order' and innate morality are violated (call them "the Laws of Earth"): 'Disorder is born in societyâ€™. Edit: Michael Dorfman has weighed in with what is apparently an authoritative Hindu source that translates the verse differently. Based on that translation, my interpretation here is incorrect - although the foundations on which I based it are not. 

In his "The French Revolution, a History", 3.3.II, Thomas Carlyle writes the following: "for all battle is well said to be misunderstanding" He is speaking in reference to the terrible conflict between the Girondins and the Jacobins, after the execution of Louis the XVI in 1793. Both sides envisioned a grand Republic of France, but according to Carlyle, they fought to the death because they misunderstood each other's visions of how that republic should be implemented. I am troubled by this passage: I understand that many 'battles' are indeed the result of misunderstanding - often our words or actions do not accurately reflect our thoughts and emotions, or are misconstrued by others. The result is often conflict. Perhaps that was indeed the case with the Girondins and the Jacobins. My gut reaction to Carlyle's assertion is that he's unquestionably wrong: There are many battles, perhaps the greatest battles that have been fought, that are not due to misunderstanding, but arise from deep seated conflicts of interest or world views that are in direct opposition: "Good vs Evil"; "Haves vs Have Nots"; "Conservative vs Progressive", etc. I found that Kant in "Metaphysical Elements of Justice", states: "in the right of nations to go to war and to carry on hostilities is the legitimate way by which they prosecute their rights by their own power when they regard themselves as injured; and this is done because in that state the method of a juridical process, although the only one proper to settle such disputes, cannot be adopted" This point of view seems clearly at odds with that expressed by Carlyle: Can we say that "the legitimate way by which they prosecute their rights by their own power when they regard themselves as injured" can be interpreted as simply a misunderstanding? A state regards itself as injured because it misunderstood the intentions of its enemies? If State A cuts off the water supply of State B and State A goes to war with State B because of such, what misunderstanding is there? Nietzsche: Ecce Homo - "It is nothing but fanaticism and beautiful soulism to expect very much (or even, much only) from humanity when it has forgotten how to wage war." Can Nietzsche's assertion here (and in many other places) that the waging of war is a fundamental and essential component of the human spirit be resolved with Carlyle's contention? Carlyle's opinion seems quite clear: if people would simply take the time to sit down and talk to one another and clear up their 'misunderstandings', the conflicting points of view that lead to conflict could be resolved - 'understood' - and there would be no need for 'battle'. It seems that Carlyle longs for state of affairs that Nietzsche would deem "nothing but fanaticism and beautiful soulism". One quite graphic historical example that seems to fly in face of Carlyle's statement is WW II: Hitler's belief in Aryan supremacy spawned in him endless ambition and a sense of entitlement, and so he set out to conquer Europe and eventually the USA, in the belief that such was the destiny of the Aryan Nation. There was no misunderstanding about it: Hitler's idealogy (his madness....) spurred him to attempt to conquer the Western World (eventually the entire world...) and if other nations did not go to war against him, he would have proceeded to do exactly that. I could cite numerous other examples from History. Thought Experiment: Two adjacent states, one in the north, and the other south of the first. There is a river that runs north/south and supplies water to both states. Over time, the population of the northerly state increases such that they deem it necessary to dam the river to supply water to their growing population, thereby cutting off the water supply of the southerly state. As a result, the southerly state wages a war against its northern neighbor, to prevent it from damming the river. How would Carlyle explain such a conflict? Where is the misunderstanding that caused this conflict? The actions of the northerly state are in direct conflict with the interests of its neighbor to the south, simply due to its own need to supply its grown population with water. There was no misunderstanding that seeded this conflict. (And I believe that my thought experiment is far more than just that: Throughout History, wars have been waged due to exactly such circumstances) From what I know of Carlyle, his roots and outlook were decidedly Christian. Is his assertion a reflection of a Christian or Utopian point of view? The longing for a day when there will no longer be 'misunderstandings'? Do the lessons of History refute Carlyle's assertion? Who expresses a philosophical position in direct opposition to Carlyle's? What is the basis for their position? 

One will observe, after following this population, that the nature of the things making up the population changes over time. This is a bit of "duh" conclusion because, well, of course you will end up with a lot of the fast-reproducing ones and few of the slow-reproducing ones, and of course you may get a lot of much faster reproducing things than any in the initial population, because the fast-reproducing ones make more copies of themselves (even if some are a bit mutated). This also applies to theoretical constructs such as numbers as well as actual biological organisms, and everything in between (and is supported by ample empirical evidence at different levels). Copious repeated applications of this theme, adapted to individual cases, are pretty much the business of evolutionary biology, and these days, it's rare to find a biology that isn't even a little bit evolutionary biology as well. It isn't hard to see that in the above example, nobody tried to make the fast-reproducing things dominate, and nobody wanted this outcome. It's just what happened, because of different rates of reproduction they have. If you get down to the differential systems describing the system, you will see that setting it up in this way literally implies that the number of fast-reproducers will increase over time (and this is really what it means "to reproduce rapidly"). Moreover, the outcome of an event cannot also be its cause, because the cause is often understood to precede the outcome in time. My investment of money in stocks last month cannot have been caused by the profit I made today, because last month, I hadn't yet made the profit. The cause can be my anticipation that I will profit, but again, evolution does not require nor seems to exhibit evidence of any "anticipation" - it will continue to repeatedly generate mutants that are unfit even though they are "clearly" not going to work out well, and evolution still works in spite of this. Teleological arguments may explain the actions of rational actors, but who wants to prove that nature is rational and/or that God exists without making circular references to evolution? 

(I am not sure if you are asking if the existence of 'substance' proves the existence of God, or if according to Christian theology your assertion is correct.) According to the theology of all the 'religions of the Book', and also Hinduism, certainly without God there can be no substance. God provides the 'platform' for the persistence of all substance. Only God can say "I am because I AM" - everything else is relatively 'accidental'. But it is not necessary to postulate God in order to explain substance. Information theory, for example, seems to contend that 'information' is the only true 'substance'. Does the persistence of information mandate the existence of God? Professor Hawking seems to think not, others, notably Sir Roger Penrose, apparently disagree. 

Your assumption (1) is a certainty - it is so, by definition. Therefore 2: 'I'm not certain that I cannot be certain of anything', is invalid. 

If you wish to live an examined life and you interact with others who do not, you must of necessity examine their unexamined lives - neglecting to do so represents a deficiency in your own examinations of your life. 

The first philosophers had no sources and no vocabulary other than what their own powers of reason could muster. But the attitude many on this site seem to take regarding "philosophy" reminds me of the attitude of classical musicians: Anything that does not fall within their accepted tradition and uses their accepted terminology is not worthy of serious consideration, ignoring the fact that much of what is today considered "classical music" was once "popular music". (Beethoven as a pianist might be categorized as a jazz musician today, based on his inventive and improvisational approach.) It seems that such an attitude endangers the pursuit of "philosophy" and risks bring about its eventual extinction - much as classical music today is limited to a very small audience relative to the population as a whole. This is a loss both to the public at large and to the 'classical community'. To quote the well known jazz musician, composer and critic Leonard Feather: 

In which case singular, existential statements ought to be verified through a scientific methodology. This verification could be the context which allows for statements to be scientific. Repeated verifications of existential statements in the context of falsifiable laws and theories gives them scientific weight. 

I believe this means that existential questions on their own cannot be scientific. However, an existential statement adds weight to theories when the statement allows for inferences which increase the explanatory power of a theory. I believe the answer here lies in context. Scientific statements, by Popper's definition, are those that can be falsified. If statements are unfalsifiable (thus unscientific) then either: 1. they would be metaphysical. or, 2. if they are phrased in the context of a falsified (thus scientific) theory then they would be scientific. And, a metaphysical theory might be true or contain some truth in them but no one can know for sure in the general. Metaphysical theories are impenetrable to criticism and discourse when they are broad and explanatory like scientific theories. However, when we apply it to a specific problem area or introduce more context to the problem we can remove it from isolation and begin to criticize and refine specific links between that metaphysical theory and the problem is attempts to elucidate Going to your first point, an isolated statement cannot be falsified; however, Popper proclaims: 

Which implies that an isolated term can be verified by other observations. 'John has black hair' may be a non-verified statement if we never actually find a John with black hair. This reminds me of Bertrand Russell's conjecture: 

In modern evolutionary biology, teleology is considered to be an irrelevant explanation for what caused things to be. Nevertheless, you may find many biologists speaking in teleological terms - "The animal evolved wings so it could fly away from predators." or "Our brains became bigger to allow us to function better socially." This is a trick that evolutionary biologists use: It turns out that most language is clumsy and inconvenient for talking about the dynamics of evolution by selection, and evolution really looks almost as if there was teleology. The key word is "almost". There are subtle differences between how an evolution with teleology and without teleology would look like. Biologists use the "trick" because they don't like being wordy and think that they are smart enough to never overlook the teleological fallacy. Teleology is regarded as irrelevant because nature has no mechanism for deciding to obtain certain outcomes beforehand. Evolution is not a means to an end, it is a consequence of some individuals making imperfect copies of themselves more often than other individuals. Whenever one has a population of things, and the following claims hold for this population: 

That's not to say you don't have to look hard to find pitfalls of teleological thinking (although it's clearly illogical after considering the nature of evolution). That's why the "trick" exists - most of the time, you can carry on happily thinking teleological thoughts and never see any ill-consequences. But that one time when it causes you to be wrong is a possibility scientists do not like to accept. Being a heuristic, the pseudo-teleology trick is not very persuasive when you are trying to settle one argument and move on to the next gene already.
