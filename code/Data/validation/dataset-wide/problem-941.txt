There is no such criterion. However, I'm sure one could devise one. For example, at any given location collect the differentials between daily maximum and minimum temperature. Average these differentials over each month and plot month vs mean differential temperature. Do this for many oceanic, continental and coastal locations. Plot the graphs, compare, and define your own criteria for different categories. But why? What purpose would it serve? 

Klanomath is technically correct regarding natural radionuclides, although in practical terms it is only radiocarbon and 36-Cl that are used to date water. Tritium, from atom bomb tests in the 1950s and 1960s used to be used, but the concentration has now decayed to levels indistinguishable from background. In some parts of the world other radionuclides such as 137-Cs from Chernobyl, can still be traced in the water. In about 40 years from now it will be possible to distinguish between pre- and post-60 year old water on the basis of the dates from which certain pesticides were banned. Similarly, in 50 years time we will be able to distinguish pre- and post- ban of CFCs. Most of the non-radiogenic indicators will be in vanishingly small quantities, typically in parts per trillion, or less, so will require pre-ultra-concentration of large water samples, and will be horribly expensive to analyze. 

If it is enclosed and undisturbed there would be a risk of the heavier gasses collecting at the base of the hole, with carbon dioxide, argon, neon and xenon displacing the nitrogen and oxygen. Hence the danger of asphyxiation for any organism at that depth. Mixing, to keep the air homogeneous would also have the effect of heat transfer to further up the hole, so you will need artificial mixing and cooling. There are likely to be traces of helium and hydrogen at such depth, but not enough for the upward flow of such light gasses to have any significant mixing effect. However, hydrogen will be a potentially explosive problem at the enclosed surface environment. At these temperatures water rock reaction at the exposed base of the hole would be rapid. It is not clear whether your hole would have punched through to the mantle. I'm assuming it would, in which case there will be water vapour - hartzburgite reaction to yield more hydrogen. Serpentinization of the rock will proceed, involving about a 17% rock expansion. The rate of such a reaction will be limited by the amount of water vapour in the hole. A by-product of the reaction will be moisture at pH12 which will rapidly react with the high partial pressure of CO2 to produce carbonate encrustation. So it will be a problem to keep the hole clean - unless you prevent any moisture entering the hole from the surface control area. 

The Antarctic land ice averages a little over 1.8 kilometres thick. Greenland ice averages a bit more than 2 kilometres thick. The circum-Antarctic ice thickness averages only between 1 and 2 metres in thickness, whilst the Arctic (all sea ice) varies between 1 and 5 metres thick - it was >6 metres thick but global warming has been thinning the ice in recent decades. At its maximum winter extents the sea ice is comparable in area to the continental ice, so the fraction of global floating ice is about 0.1%. If you need a more accurate answer then I suggest you trawl the internet for areal extents, and do a seasonal mass balance. Obviously, it will vary according to which hemispheric winter you choose. I suggest 'Arctic Sea Ice News' $URL$ as a good starting point. 

There isn't much to choose between them. They are both variants of the same general equation. They both take account of the three main variables: temperature, rate of advective removal of moisture (proportional to surface wind velocity), and difference in vapour pressure (which can be related to humidity). In countries using SI units there are several other evaporation equations along similar lines Some other equations do not take adequate account of advection (the 'v' parameter), and hence I would advise against using such equations. Strictly, the best equation, favoured by FAO, and in a slightly modified form by the American society of Civil Engineers, is the classic Penman-Monteith equation: 

In only one minute of presentation there isn't time for detailed discussion, so one has to make broad generalizations which, on closer inspection, aren't quite true. It is true that most sand is made of quartz, and that most of this quartz arises from weathered granitic rocks, of which the main minerals are quartz, orthoclase and plagioclase, usually with some mica, quite rarely some amphibole and almost never olivine. In the magma olivine and quartz react to make either amphiboles (if it is a very hydrous melt) or pyroxenes. It is possible to find a sedimentary rock made of weathered out quartz and feldspar grains. Depending upon the original chemistry the feldspar could be potassium-rich (orthoclase) or sodium-calcium-rich (plagioclase). The resulting sedimentary rock is known as an arkose. Arkose is common in dry areas of eroding granite, such as the dryer parts of sub Saharan Africa. However, it is much more common for the weathering to involve wet erosion - thousands of cycles of rain and sun, hot and cold, in which case the feldspars mostly decompose to clay (many varieties and sub-species). Olivine is much more characteristic of basic volcanic rocks, especially basalts, which do not weather to yield quartz grains. Another rock type in which olivine is a major component is peridotite. This weathers to yield goethite (a kind of ironstone) and serpentine. Occasionally, if the pyroxene to olivine ratio is sufficiently high, the weathering can yield quartz as a secondary by-product. Another feature of quartz: Over long periods and especially at high temperatures and/or high pressures, it is very slightly soluble. Not that you would notice. The sand isn't going to dissolve beneath your feet, but every litre of surface water contains a few milligrams of dissolved quartz as silicic acid, which takes part in a whole catalogue of geological processes. In addition, there are many other rocks besides granite which yield quartz grains, including quartzite, weathered pre-existing sandstone, schist, gneiss, and some intermediate rocks (complex chemistry between granite and basalt. Even limestone - rocks that are generally thought of as 'pure' calcium carbonate, generally have a percent or two of insoluble residue, of which quartz is the dominant component. 

When rain displaces pore gasses in the soil, bubbles of soil gas are released into the atmosphere. It's impossible to be precise about the composition because it is so variable from place to place. It varies according to soil type, organic content, degree of rotting, temperature, and the microbiological cross section (itself hugely variable). Most soil gas is odourless, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, etc. Others, like geosmin, are very smelly. In addition to 'petrichor' there are terpenes, aldehydes, alcohols and esters, to name but a few of the natural volatile organic compounds. Of course, one cannot rule out the foul smell or rotting animals in some places. 

It's simple. Specific Gravity is dimensionless. It's just a ratio. Density is dimensional, such as grams per cubic centimeter, kilograms per litre, tonnes per cubic metre, etc. 

In theory, maybe you could do it, but some of the jet stream loops are even tighter than in Aabaakawad's examples. The wind shear and associated turbulence in and around the jet stream's are so severe that no 'light plane' could survive. Any glider-like aircraft would break up almost immediately. 

Look at it this way: According to the American National Center of Atmospheric research, the Earths atmosphere weighs 5.148 x 10^^18 kg., and that atmosphere is composed of about 20.8 to 20.9% oxygen (depending on moisture content of the air). So the Earths atmosphere contains about 1.07 million trillion kgs of oxygen. The 7.5 billion (or so) humans on the planet, each converts an average of about 0.73 kg of oxygen per day, converting most of it to exhaled CO2. So the planetary consumption of oxygen by humans, as a percentage of the total available, is about 100 x 0.73 x 10^^9 / 1.07 x 10^^18 %. That is, about half of one millionth of 1% of the Earths available oxygen, a level of oxygen deficiency that is almost instantly dispelled by turbulent mixing in the troposphere (i.e.by 'weather'). So no, there is no chance of gasping for oxygen in deserts or polar wastes. Now gasping for air 8000 metres up a mountain, or in a crowded disco with cigarette smoke and poor ventilation - that is another question! 

The maximum one-hour rainfall may be 305 mm in America, or 401 mm in Australia, but it certainly isn't the world record measurement, which is in the region of 450 to 500 mm (based upon the global rainfall intensity envelope). The maximum possible is governed by three factors, namely 1) the precipitable moisture in the air column, which is a non-linear function of temperature, assuming no limiting evaporation upwind, 2) the dynamics of condensation, assuming no limitation on the availability of raindrop nuclei, and 3) the lateral advective delivery of moisture. This means that the maximum rainfall is likely to be on the windward side of a high mountain in a tropical oceanic island. We will probably never be able to measure the maximum rainfall because, by its nature, it will be in a very windy exposed site, where it is notoriously difficult if not impossible to measure the rainfall accurately. Also, consider the open area of a rain-gauge funnel, and the probability of that just happening to be in the right place to measure the maximum rainfall over many square kilometers. A good description of the probable maximum precipitation is given by Greiser in: $URL$
