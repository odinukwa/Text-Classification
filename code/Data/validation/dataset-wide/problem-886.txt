Yes, the orbits change massively over time. For example, Earth's eccentricity (how close to a circle the orbit is), its axial tilt (what causes seasons), and precession (which direction the Earth's spin axis points) change on these huge cycles, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years long. They are caused by the pull of the other planets, mainly Jupiter and Saturn (since they are so huge), as well as the physics of inertial reference frames. These are known as the Milankovitch cycles. Here is a neat video explaining what each of the cycles are in detail. That video is about Earth, but the same concepts apply to all the other planets too, just on different amounts and timescales. An asteroid hitting a planet would technically change its orbit, however how much is questionable. An asteroid a couple km across would barely nudge the Earth since the Earth is bigger by many orders of magnitude. It would also destroy everything on the planet, but thats another story. Way back in the solar system's formation, when Thea hit Earth (theoretically) it was much closer in size than the Earth, so no doubt that it caused a much more significant shift in orbit. 

xkcd also shows an approximation of what it would look like if you tried to take a picture of an average desk from orbit. It is just a smear of colors, devoid of any discernible detail. I tried attaching the pictures here, but SE doesn't like the png files for some reason and I don't have time to do the file conversion. Just check out the first link to see what it looks like, plus a more detailed explanation of why. 

It does appear to depend on the mass of the companion, and whether they actually collide or merely pass close. If they didn't form together, it is unlikely that they will be captured in each other's orbit later on, so the WD might just pass through the system, disrupting planets as it goes but leaving the other star unharmed. There doesn't appear to be a one-size-fits-all answer here. 

An answer to your question is not known at this time. From the Internal Structure section of Jupiter's Wikipedia page, 

xkcd already did the math on this one! Like Gauti's answer, xkcd also links to this question on Hubble's website. Hubble moves too fast for its minimum exposure time to be able to focus on anything on the surface. He goes one step further, linking to this article on Bad Astronomy that points out that Hubble frequently points at the sunlight side of Earth to help calibrate its WFPC2 camera. 

There is an accepted answer already, but there is a couple known cases of a star we know has gone supernova, and yet we can still see it. This source describes one such unique circumstance. The star that exploded happened to be in a galaxy that was behind another massive one from our point of view. The alignment was just right such that the light formed an Einstein Cross. The light from each point on the cross takes a different path to get here, and each of those paths are different lengths. Thus, the different points on the cross show the star at 4 different times in its final years. The Space.com article I linked was written in 2015. Scientists first noticed the supernova in 2014, and each image of the supernova arrived within a year of when it was first noticed. If I'm understanding that article correctly, as of now (2017) all of the images of that supernova show the supernova aftermath, and not the star beforehand. However, there was a period of time where we could see the star both pre and post-supernova at the same time. You imply in your question that you are focusing on stars within our own galaxy. I don't know of any such situations of Einstein Cross events closer to home that let us do this. 

If you're like me and you just want lots of interesting facts about space without all of the academic level of complexity, you may enjoy watching the Crash Course Astronomy series. There are a lot of other good resources on YouTube, such as Deep Sky Videos or Deep Astronomy. If you want something more fun and interactive, may I suggest playing Kerbal Space Program. I've learned a lot about how orbital mechanics, aerodynamics, and engineering just from playing this game. There is a question on the Space Exporation Stack Exchange that does a good job of covering how much can be learned from playing. 

xkcd worked this out! It was part of a related question: what if you pointed an infinite power laser in random directions, how much damage would happen? I'll try to summarize the parts of his analysis relevant to this question. If you choose a truly random direction, you'd have about a 50% chance of hitting the Earth. For the times you don't hit Earth, 89,999 times out of 90,000 your beam will pass out of the Milky Way without hitting anything. The objects you have the highest chance of hitting are the Sun or Moon, but the odds of hitting either of them is about 1 in 180,000. He goes on to show that your odds of hitting one of Jupiter's moons is about 1 in 1 trillion. Hitting a star is even harder, "even if you aim for the core [of the Milky Way]." He doesn't seem to have worked it out to the level of individual photons hitting individual hydrogen atoms, but given that space is mostly empty anyway the angular size method he uses should be a reasonable approximation. 

But the problem is a hypothetical one, as no alternate Universe were found until now. We can play with different Universes in some theoretical constructions. For example, the spacetime of a rotating black hole looks like as if it would be some gateway to somewhere, out of our Minkowski-Universe (or to a different point of our current one). Google for Penrose-diagrams and for the topological extensions of the General Relativity, if you would like to play with it more. 

the Newtonian gravity is a very good and very simple approximation. In it, gravity is always attracting and so is it. 

There is no such limit, at least not a meaningful one. If the gravity would be more strong, smaller hydrogene clouds could evolve to stars, even Jupiter or Earth sized, or much smaller. As you increase the strength of the gravity, the required mass for star formation decreases, but stars will still exist. 

There is another major problems. The largest is that the Venus practically doesn't rotate (more exactly, its rotation period is around a half year), thus an Earth-like mean temperature would mean a very hot sun-side and a very cold dark one. However, its tight athmosphere works as a strong heat balancer - on the current Venus, practically there is no difference between the day and night sides. Although a 90 atm CO2 + 4 atm N2 athmosphere isn't very humanfriendly, we would probably need to compansate it with spacesuits filled with 94 atm He + 0.2 atm O2. The solar soil could be best positioned on the L1 Lagrange-point between the Venus and the Sun: 

This picture show the Earth-Sun Lagrange-points, but the Sun-Venusian Lagrange points are very similar The Sun-Venus L1 is around 2million km away from the Venus, and it is unstable for point-like mass points. However, in the case of a not point-like body (a planetary-sized foil isn't point-like), or by manipulating the radiation pressure of the Sun, could be made statically stable, or could be stabilized dynamically. 

Extending @Aaron: Which also does matter, that it is relatively common in the universe ( $URL$ ). For example, rubidium has a much lower ionization energy, but it can only be found in traces, while sodium is one of the most frequent elements in the stony planets. 

There is no way to know, if any other "different Universe" exists. There is also a terminologic problem with it. Universe means, on latinic, something what "contains everything". 

This "laser star" is a hypotethical object in an Asimov short story, which has a special star-like object with very uncommon properties. But this is entirely Asimov's invention. In the reality, no such thing was found until now. Not even any similar. 

The result is that the Moon has a nearly perfect circular orbit around the Sun, the effect of the Earth is only a perturbation in it: 

There are relatively big varieties, but most of them is between 10 and 70 km/s. If a comet is a periodic comet, that means it needs to have an elliptic orbit around the Sun. That gives an upper limit to its speed of the escape speed from the solar system on the orbit of the Earth. That is around 40 km/s. But this 40 km/s is in the reference frame of the Sun. The Earth is moving in this reference frame with around 30 km/s, on a nearly circular orbit. Between the escape speed and the mean speed of a circular orbit there is always a $\sqrt{2}$ relation. It is a physical law. Theoretically it were possible to find extrasolar comets (if the speed of it were bigger as around 70 km/s, it were a clear signature of its remote origin), but they aren't coming. 

In fact, the "waves" are much smaller (400.000km Moon orbital radius to 150.000.000km Earth orbital radius) This is mainly because $R_{Earth-Moon} \ll R_{Earth-Sun}$, and $M_{Moon} \ll M_{Earth} \ll M_{Sun}$. In general, 3-body gravitationally bound systems tend to be unstable, i.e. one of the components tends to fly away with time. But this system seems stable, because the ratio of the masses are big. The same can't be said from the whole Solar System, (it is a notoriously unsolved problem) although also this seems stable in human time scales. 

It has a very, very low chance. However, if the asteroid is larger as some centimeters, it will irrecoverable destruct the satellite. Typically, mm sized space trash can damage a satellite already, although the tipical impact velocities are in the order of some $\frac{km}{s}$. As a comparision, cannon balls are flying typically with lesser speed as $1 \frac{km}{s} {}^*$. A collision with an asteroid on a solar orbit would have the impact speed in the order of some tens of $\frac{km}{s}^{**}$. A direct collision with an asteroid larger as the satellite itself would have enough energy to vaporize the satellite. We, from the Earth, would see a space explosion. *: Orbital velocity on low earth orbit is $7.8 \frac{km}{s}$, but most satellites are flying prograde with a not very high inclination. Thus, the we can estimate their "typical" relative collision velocity in the order of some $\frac{km}{s}$. **: The configuration is similar in heliocentris orbits, but the velocities are higher with an order. 

This can result anything, even a repelling gravitational force. For example, parallel laser beams going into opposite direction repel eachother. The problem is that we would need 40-60 orders higher energy densities to have a measurable effect, so it remains only a theoretical calculation. In the "common" situations, i.e. if we have planets,
