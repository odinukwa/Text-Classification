To explain Luis's comment, if you took your attempted proof, and tried to express it in a formal grammar, you would actually arrive at the same class of self-referential problems that Godel found must arise due to that self-referentiality. Russel and Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica, an attempt to build all of logic and mathematics on a small number of axioms (but not 0 axioms, as you deal with in this case). They actually got quite far using the same mindset you had -- circular logic is illegal. Godel later showed that, if you can describe all characteristics of the Whole Numbers using your axiomatic system, and can describe the provability of its own statements (as PM did) it must be inconsistent. Thus one must accept the value of logic intuitively, based on your belief that the axioms behind the logic are valid. Or, a more robust approach would be to accept that there may be situations where logic can only serve as a guide, not an oracle of truth. (A related proof was made by Tarksi, showing that any formal language which can prove all of arithmetic over whole numbers and contains the logical negation operator cannot define its own semantic Truth. Typically the concept of True and False are assumed by most approaches to logic) 

By invoking terms like "axiom" and "formal system," I naturally am inclined to answer from a mathematical perspective. What you describe calls for a self-referential system, so that it may refer to its axioms as elements of the system. The closest you can get to an existence argument using this analogy would probably be to assert the truthfulness of the axioms for God using the formal system itself. Doing this puts you square in the realm of nuanced mathematical challenges like Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and Tarski's undefinability theorem, which put interesting limits on what can and cannot be said within that formal system. On the other hand, there's work like the work of Dan Willard which explore carefully crafted formal systems which skirt these theorems and manage to be "self verifying," meaning the system can be used to prove the systems validity. Of course, all of this is making the assumption that reality is sufficiently analogous to a formal system to make these analogies worthwhile. A proof of that claim would be something indeed. 

No If anyone has questions like this, the first thing to do should always be to build a test matrix to see if your theory is sound or not. 

Typically, no. The key question is: is a human logically consistent? Can you come up with examples of humans that have been logically consistent from birth to death? Can we come up with one example? If we cannot come up with an example of a human that has been logically consistent at all times, then we cannot claim "human beings always act rationally." If you keep digging at the question, you can arrive at a tautology. If you define "internally consistent" as "doing what you were going to do," then most will agree that humans are internally consistent, as are dogs, cats... heck, really all animals plants and rocks are "internally consistent" by that definition. An interesting question may be therein: at what point in modeling do we transition from being inconsistent to consistent? Is it a point, or something else? My personal opinion is that the point where you can start arguing that the system is consistent is the point where you start treating the entity as a distributed entity with many independent parts, but at that point "internally consistent" becomes a complicated concept. 

I've posted this one a few times. Define "free-will" and you can progress towards an answer. The simplest form of "the freedom to choose ones actions" is rapidly disproved by someone locking you in a small box. You clearly do not have the freedom to walk out and observe a sunset. Thus any meaningful version of free-will will recognize that free-will is not complete freedom to do anything without concern as to the environment around you (and the actions of others). There will always be some interaction. The second issue to deal with is what has "freewill" in the first place. What defines such an entity? Clearly you have very limited freewill to do things which are contrary to what your brain-state was a few microseconds ago, so there is some concept of an envelope defining an "agent" which has freewill. That exact definition is important for combining determinism with freewill because you're going to have to track that envelope back through time to make sense of the two of them. Does your self-as-agent begin at conception with no size, or do you include some of the state of the sperm and egg? If you include those, you can track all of that back to the beginning of time. By this particular definition of an agent, you have freewill because "you" were there right at the beginning (albeit it was a pretty darn rough ride until time progressed long enough to give you a body). There are plenty of other directions to look, and other models. However, I have found definitions for "free-will" and "self" are essential for any systematic analysis of freewill. Pick your definitions, and work from there. 

I can't say their theory is right. Not only is the best answer not always voted up (I've seen plenty of counter examples), but the "best" answer is not always the "true" answer. Sometimes the best answer is technically false, but leads people towards inspiration. However, the argument is intriguing in its circularity. The mere presence of the belief that "The best answers are voted up and rise to the top" encourages people to vote for the best answers, and an easy scripting tool puts those answers at the top. Thus, while you can't make the claim that their little pithy phrase is true, you can state that the mere act of stating it encourages best answers to be voted up and rise to the top. 

In this, we see a pattern of starting with potential and ending with depletion which strongly correlates to the idea of "life" and "death" as you refer to them in your question. As a general rule, the young are more likely to still have great potential in them, simply due to having more time and having a body that hasn't worn out yet. There are absolutely counter examples in the world, but the general rule is strong enough to create a general pattern of associating youth with life and old age with death. As for the idea of life coming from death, as you mention, this does indeed occur in our lives. It's why we have wakes to celebrate people's lives rather than funerals. It's why we appreciate what a forest fire does to revitalize a Forrest. However, these are generally more difficult concepts to work with. It is much simpler to draw the connection between youth and life. And finally, the answer may simply be "because it works." Cultural patterns like this often form because they worked well for many generations. Perhaps it helped with the grieving process. Perhaps it spurred youth into action while they still had the bodies to act. Never forget that cultures are living breathing organisms in and of themselves. 

This depends on what other rights an individual has. We love to ascribe rights to humans, to make sure nobody can take things away from us, and it causes trouble when they conflict. For example, the "right to suicide" is highly controversial, but it meshes well with "the right to not work." If you simply want to stop working at life, feel free to. However, if you have the "right to nationalized healthcare," then the "right to not work" becomes tricky. In the former case, you can strive towards have no negative cost to the world, but in the latter you are obliged to receive healthcare, at a cost to the world. I have found the discussion in the form of "Does a person have the right to _______" is not one that can be answered simply in a Q&A format. Consider, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a watershed document in the world of human rights. It has not been signed by every country. In particular there are a group of Islamic countries who believe the document contradicts their religious rights, and have counter proposed Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam as an alternate set of basic human rights which better meshes with their religion. They chose to call it "equal human dignity" rather than "equal human rights," and they define a few details slightly differently to better map to their religion. If we cannot truly agree on the right we already claim to uphold, then the discussion of adding new human rights is rather tricky, is it not? 

Finding an alternative to the scientific method depends on you deciding what you want out of a method. You will never find a better tool than the scientific method at it's game. However, if that game is not what you really want it to be, there are alternatives. The most visible example of this I have seen is western medicine compared to Traditional Chinese Medicine. They developed very different approaches, and yet both appear to yield results. TCM actually does work on line along your questioning: it is not fundamentally built off of rejecting hypothesis. Let's look at the scientific method, and see if we can make some headway. There are two major features of the scientific method which stand out as "interesting" for this line of thinking: 

Whenever you dabble with infinities, intuition must be challenged. They do not behave as finite quantities do. It is not immediately provable that infinite regress of causation is impossible merely due to the example you provide. An equally valid argument might be that the soldier will fire the bullet after an infinitely long wait. Or, alternatively, the soldier may fire the bullet in a finite amount of time if it is possible for the soldiers and their superiors to communicate with infinite speed. It's even plausible that the soldier could fire the bullet in a finite amount of time with non-infinite communication speeds if one could argue that the order to fire was given infinitely far in the past, before the soldier ever had eyes on their enemy. These alternatives may seem awkward, but they must be. At the heart of the logic puzzle is an infinite number of mathematically perfect soldiers all of which are incapable of acting without a superior's authorization. By putting such polished gleaming pistons into your machine, you create a physically unrealistic scenario which may be responded to with equally physically unrealistic solutions. Mathematicians do have tools to explore such infinities, and you may be able to phrase the question in the language of mathematics to come to an answer. For example, if you wish to find a solution using ZF set theory, it is entirely plausible that your representation of "causality" may posit the existence of an infinite regress in a form which is contrary to the Axiom of Regularity (which has much to say about infinite regress). In such a case, you could confirm that such a construct would be impossible in ZF. However, the burden would then be on you as the philosopher to argue why this result has the intended implications in our world. 

Math, in all its forms, does not "work." There are countless non-mainstream mathematical construct which are deemed "interesting" but don't "work." Set theories involving quines, for example. Mainstream mathematics "works" because of selection bias -- we only consider a mathematical construct "mainstream" if it "works." As for whether it can be proven, that depends 100% on what you mean by "proven." In fact, mathematics has an entire sub-discipline called "proof theory" trying to define what that one word means. However, at the bottom of most mathematical theories are axioms which are explicitly left unproven. 

The key to the question would be the definition of "visualize." As an example, we see the hypercube visualized in several of these answers, but that may or may not be the concept of "visualization" that you are interested in. One might argue that we can't "visualize" anything higher than 3 dimensions because our eyes (vision) see a 3d world (or rather, see into a 3d world, via a pair of 2d projections). On the other hand, it's currently believed that the neurons of the neocortex are laid out in a rather regular 2d pattern. If one can claim visualisation is something doable with the neocortex (rather than the cerebellum or other parts), one would argue that visualization must naturally contain mappings from 3d to 2d, suggesting a definition of visualization may include mapping from higher dimensions to lower. And if you make the assumption that visualization is entirely described via the firing of neurons, one must argue that visualization includes mapping a continuous space into a discrete space of neuron firings. Arguably that is a much more extraordinary mapping than a mere 4d to 3d continuous mapping. Also perhaps useful is to look at kinethestics. Modern physics will model the movement of a rigid body in 6 or 9 dimensions, accounting for not only positions but velocities and even accelerations. Movement of the spine may involve dozens of these, so visualizing spinal movement might call for modeling 100 dimensions or more, depending on how you frame the problem. So in all, this answer may not give you an easy yes or no, but it does point to the reality that the concept of "visualization" is not so firm that yes or no answers become easy.
