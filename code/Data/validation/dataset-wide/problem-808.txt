Exoplanets: As you see in the resolution B5, this definition is specified for "Planet in the Solar System". It is mainly because it does not really make sense now that it is already challenging to observe planets, so the distinction between a planet and a dwarf planet is not yet crucial for exoplanets. So the official definition of an exoplanet by IAU makes mainly a difference between a planet and a brown dwarf. However, I guess the IAU definition of a planet should be kept for the other planetary systems if we are able to detect objects such as dwarf planets. 

What you say is not quite true: the search for exoplanets is clearly intensive, but it is far from the only things astronomers are looking at. Most of the time, in two words, the situation is: resolution & wavelength. Whatever the field (if you are interested in galaxies, interstellar medium, stars and so on) you want more resolution, to resolve smaller scales (most stars are still points even with our best telescopes, or we are still far from resolving individual stars in galaxies!), to have more informations, to understand better the underlying physics. You want more wavelength, because spectroscopy gives you much more phsyical information than a single wavelength observation, for example. And to combine both is sometimes challenging: to have high resolution observations in infrared is not that easy, and it can be crucial for some fields (if you ever want to see a star forming, you better observe it in infrared, since this baby is embedded in its gas cloud that shields very efficiently its radiation). That being said, the routine tasks of an astronomer would be 

More dirty details: There is an excellent talk by Scott Tremaine, given at ESO last year you could watch online. 

The clipping above from the Albuquerque Journal doesn't really answer your question, but astronomers have been hunting for a largeish planet beyond Pluto for quite some time now.

(Pluto is invisible but at the center of the cross-- the bright object nearby is 13 Oph, not Pluto). A perhaps more interesting question: what is the closest approach of the two orbits, even if the planets in question aren't occupying that given point in the orbit. 

state that UTC advanced from being 0.085272 seconds behind UT1 on 30 Dec 2015 to being only 0.083475 behind UT1 on 31 Dec 2015. That means UTC advanced on UT1 by 0.085272 minus 0.083475 (equals 0.001797) seconds. In other words, the rotation period from 30 Dec 2015 to 31 Dec 2015 was 86400.001797 seconds. Once the predicted UTC is more than 0.5 seconds ahead of UT1, a leap second will be announced for the following June 30th or December 31st. 

WebGeocalc ($URL$ is actually a fairly useful tool, and the next best thing to downloading the CSPICE libraries, so let me provide a slightly more detailed answer to your question. When you first visit WebGeocalc, you will see something like this: Because you are looking for perihelions, which involve distance, scroll down and choose "distance finder": Since you want to find the perihelion of Mercury, fill out the top half of the form like this: For this example, I'll find all perihelions from 1900 to 2201. A perihelion is a minimum of distance, and since you're looking for all perihelions, choose "is local minimum" on the lower half of the form, so it looks as follows: 

These different phases are due to the interplay of cooling and heating processes of its own components (Wolfire et al. 1995). The lowest density regions are hot and associated to supernova expansion bubbles. The HII regions (HII for "ionized hydrodgen") are associated with O stars (massive stars that can efficiently ionized their environment). The highest density you can get with no evidence of forming stars are of the order of 10^4 cc (see for example this talk by Ward-Thompson on starless cores). Dense, molecular clouds that are about to collapse and form a star have a density of the order of 10^6-10^7 cc. 

in orbit around the Sun with a sufficient mass so that self-gravity overcome rigid body forces (that assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium) has cleared its neighbourhood. 

Origin of Earth rotation There are two main phenomena that explain Earth rotation. First one is linked to the history of the solar system: there is angular momentum in the interstellar medium (ISM), so the collapsing cloud that formed our solar system had an initial angular momentum (rotation of the galaxy and turbulence in the ISM are typically a good candidate for that; see for example Mac Low & Klessen 2004). By conservation of the latter, particles in the collapsing cloud accelerate (the norm of the angular momentum $I$ is $mrv$, with $m$ the mass of the system, $r$ the radius and $v$ the velocity; as the cloud contracts, $r$ decreases and then $v$ has to increase) and due to centrifugal force, a disk will tend to form. By conservation of the angular momentum in the protoplanetary disk, you will also tend to form bodies that rotates. The second phenomena is linked to the formation history of the Earth. Simply put, Earth formation history is due to collisions of planetesimals (let say they are big chunks of rock, formed by a collision history of smaller chunks of rock, formed by...); these planetesimals are orbiting the forming star in the protoplanetary disk, their rotation being linked to the disk formation history (see above). When planetesimals collide, two things can basically happen: either the collision is perfectly central (meaning that the momentum of one of the two colliding objects is pointed toward the center of mass of the second object) and there is no transfer of angular momentum, either the collision is lateral and there is a transfer of angular momentum. Depending on the configuration, you can either transfer momentum that will make the other body rotating on way or the other. That being said, you can then object that there should be a equirepartition of collisions pushing the proto-Earth to rotate in both directions. Which is true, but external planetesimals are rotating faster than internal ones. Therefore, from the proto-Earth perspective (meaning, in a physical sense, in its reference frame), internal planetesimals are seen as coming backward, from front, and external planetesimals are seen as coming forward, from behind. Long story short, there are both transfering momentum in the same "direction", forcing the proto-Earth to rotate in the same direction as the rotation of the protoplanetary disk (see for example Artem'ev & Radzievskii 1965). Rotation around the Sun This one's easy: gravity. The Earth is constantly falling towards the Sun because of gravity, and the centripetal acceleration counteracts perfectly gravity, mainting the Earth on its orbit. 

is deceptive if not outright incorrect (tineye shows 15 results, some of which seem reliable, but I couldn't find the originating source). Notice how much Pluto moves from 1979 to 1989, compared to how much Neptune moves in the same period. It seems that Pluto moved a lot more, but, since Pluto was about the same distance away as Neptune, it should be moving at nearly the same speed, not faster. As Stellarium shows, Neptune and Pluto are about 40 degrees apart in 1999 (as viewed from the Sun) significantly more than the diagram in the other question indicates (this might be an artifact of the planes being tilted 17 degrees and an unusual perspective view): 

I might be misunderstanding your question, but using HORIZONS ($URL$ with these settings should give you the data you need: 

This frustrated me as well when I first used the Tycho-2 catalog. Not finding a well known bright star can be disconcerting. Quoting from $URL$ 

OLD ANSWER FOR REFERENCE (note that Sirius does not have known exoplanets, so the Sirius solution I propose below wouldn't work): As others have noted, since Sirius is 25 times more luminous than our Sun (though still not luminous as Canopus or Rigel), so it would be the brightest star for most nearby star systems, and all the exoplanets we've found are fairly closeby. The only possible exception would be an exoplanet orbiting Sirius itself, since Sirius would be considered their sun, and not a star in the night sky. Unfortunately, Sirius' smaller companion, Sirius B, would be much brighter than our Sun there. I'm also pretty sure Sirius B would be in the night sky (not just in the daytime sky), so it would count. I'd like to poke around a bit more before declaring this answer complete. I think I can show that any point where the Sun is brighter than Sirius must be less than 4.3 light years (and probably much less) away from our solar system, so, unless we discover an star system MUCH closer than Proxima Centauri, there are no exoplanets where our Sun is the brightest star. 

There is no "orbital path" detected, that's why it is a "free-floating planet". There is no radial velocity mesured, but the informations given by its kinematic location show that it belongs to the beta Pictoris group, that is a stellar group. For more dirty details, have a look at the submitted paper on PSO J318.5-22: $URL$ Comment: Apart from that (the following reflects my personal opinion) the term "free-floating planet" is ill-chosen; it is clearly a very low-mass object, but since it is not orbiting around another larger object, it seems to me that the term "planet" is not pertinent. I think that it should be consider more than a "very low-mass brown-dwarf". The problem arises from IAU definition of a brown-dwarf and a exoplanet, that is probably not well-fitted for this kind of objects (and that is not really physical). You will notice, by the way, that this object is moving in a stellar group, which kind of reinforce my point. 

What you could think at first, regarding the orientation of any planetary system, is that it should be roughly in the plane of the galaxy, simply by angular momentum conservation. But, when you take a look at observations, you see that protoplanetary disks orientation is not what you would expect, with no preferential orientation (protoplanetary disks are embryo of planetary systems, that makes them interesting). In the following figure, the orientation corresponds to the inclination between the line of sight and the rotation axis of the disk. 

Such objects are surrounded by an accretion disk, that is a disk of gas, the gas being accreted onto the central object. However, at this stage of its life, the accretion disk around the black hole of a binary system like GRS-1915+105 is strongly depleted. Therefore, the accretion rate is not sufficient to support a coutinuous burst. Matter fills the outer disk until a critical density is reached, that triggered an outburst. Mass from the companion star is lost by a Roche lobe overflow mechanism. References: 

EDIT: entirely new answer based on comments You may actually be on to something here. The most obvious (and thus least interesting) answer is that they were depicting Orion shortly after sunset, not shortly before sunrise (all times UTC): Here is the helical rising of Orion today, and it does indeed go right to left: 

Stars do not change their right ascension or declination values as the Earth turns. The position of the stars in the night sky (called azimuth and elevation) will change, but that's because the lines of right ascension also move. However, right ascension and declination do not uniquely define an object. Over time, stars move with respect to the sun (called "proper motion"), and the direction of the Earth's north pole (currently pointing near Polaris, the North Star) also changes (called "precession"). 

If you visit $URL$ you see several sky cultures that include various constellation shapes (you also get this directory when you download stellarium). As an example, lets look at $URL$ in particular the file $URL$ and line number 127 which reads: 

The ecliptic is in periodic wobble wrt the celestial sphere, but that's because of nutation, not precession. Precession (nodal precession) changes where the Sun is during the equinoxes and solstices. The Spring Equinox, for example, has moved from Aries (it's still called "the first point of Aries") to near the Pisces-Aquarius border 

OK, I see what you did. You looked at the osculating elements for Mercury's orbit around the solar system barycenter, by using Horizons with these parameters: 

I read this as "Benenaim" (another name for Alkaid) too (not Etamin, which is another name for Gamma Draconis), and that star does indeed transit the meridian near midnight on April 4th (12:44am to be more precise). Note that the hour angle is 0 in the Stellarium screenshot below, and the star is only 35 minutes from the zenith position:
