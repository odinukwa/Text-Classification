You seem to be under the belief that the concept of redshifting causes objects to appear red. While this is certainly a true statement, it is not exclusively true. Redshifting simply makes wavelengths longer (and thus shifted red-ward, towards the red end of the spectrum). It is certainly possible that an object which was once blue could be redshifted into the red and thus appear more red than it naturally is. However, an object that emitted most strongly in the UV could redshift into the green and thus appear more green than it naturally is. Some such effect may be going on in this image, but in actuality, I think there's other stuff going on. You have to account for image processing. It's very difficult to take a "real color" image of a galaxy. Very often (as was the case with the HUDF), images are taken in a few different color bands and combined together with some sort of image processing program. Its up to the discretion of the image processor to balance the colors correctly, get the right saturation, hues, luminosities, etc. There are actually a variety of different forms of the HUDF that include different bands and different forms of image processing where the images that appear green in your image don't appear green in those. An example is shown below of a rendition of the HUDF, taken directly from the same NASA/STScI Hubble website you found your image on. The coloration is significantly different than yours and many of the greenish galaxies from your image appear more blue. 

This certainly plays a part too. Even if you find a binary system with an SBH that is active and producing X-rays, you're still going to have a hard time teasing out an exoplanet signal, especially if that exoplanet is small (i.e., smaller than Jupiter). The transit method would be difficult due to the natural variability and hence noise in the X-ray emissions and the radial velocity method may not be sensitive enough to small planets. Such a measurement would be really hard. 

To understand this, you have to understand what it means to have negative or positive energy. Following the example given by the text, the gravitational attraction of the Earth and Moon is a system with negative energy. This is because it requires an energy input to undo the system. One must exert energy to separate them, thus requiring energy input to the system to break it apart. The matter comprising the Earth however is all positive energy. You can get an energy output from this matter and thus it must be positive. An example of energy output might be a gravity assist around the Earth, radioactive decay of nuclear materials in the Earth, or matter-antimatter annihilation of Earth particles. Any process that involves a matter interaction producing energy in the form of heat/light/whatever takes that energy out the Earth's matter and represents an energy output. Note that energy in the matter may take many forms such as heat, motion, or simply the intrinsic energy comprised in matter (via the famous $E=mc^2$ equation) The black hole, much like the Earth, is simply comprised of matter (albeit in some unknown form at the singularity) and as such energy can be extracted from this matter, making it a system with positive energy. 

To answer this you have to consider a very particular point I made in the last section which was that for galaxies the primary contribution to their peculiar velocity is their orbital motion around the cluster barycenter which can result in peculiar velocities on the order of $10^3\:\mathrm{km/s}$. When trying to map out a particular cluster in redshift space, you can often get "Fingers of God" in your maps which are a result of the cluster appearing elongated towards the observer and due entirely to the orbital peculiar motion. An example of such an effect is below, with the red circles added by me to indicate these fingers of god.

A Popular Astronomy article also discusses the eclipse observation in detail. They describe the primary telescopes used for photography. The first was a 65-foot telescope (that measurement being the length, not the aperture). 

An event horizon is not an inherent component of any given object. It's not like once a star turns into a black hole, it suddenly gets an event horizon. The event horizon is merely a mathematical boundary which defines the distance from a mass $M$ where the escape velocity equals the speed of light. I can calculate such a boundary for a black hole, for the Sun, the Earth, or even you. So I guess the answer here is no, having an event horizon does not imply the existence of a singularity. 

This question is someone open-ended since you don't provide many constraints, so I'll impose the following two conditions of my own to help me give an answer: 

When you talk about the tangential velocity, there are multiple components of this black hole you/they may be talking about. One such tangential velocity is the tangential velocity of the event horizon (defined by $r_e$ above). We can take a look at the case of a maximally rotating black hole and say that the angular momentum, based on the equations above, of such a black hole is given by $$J_{max} = a_{max}Mc = M^2c$$ Note that I've dropped the geometrized units just to be completely explicit. This has introduced an extra $c$ now. Remember that $a_{max}$ is achieved when $a/M=1$. We can also define the angular momentum using the standard equation from physics 101, $J=rMv_\perp$, where of course $r$ is the radius of your object, and $v_\perp$ is the perpendicular, or else tangential, velocity of your spinning object. Recall from above that for a maximally rotating black hole, $r_e=M$ so we also have that $$J_{max} = r_eMv_{\perp} = M^2v_\perp$$ You can see that these two equations for $J_{max}$ only equal each other if the tangential velocity $v_\perp$ is equal to the speed of light $c$. So yes, you are correct to presume that at the fastest possible rotations, the black hole's event horizon is rotating at the speed of light! I said though that there are multiple components you could talk about when discussing rotating black holes. The other, as you allude to, is the rotating singularity. You correctly point out - "how can a singularity have a tangential velocity"? As it turns out, Kerr black holes don't have point singularities, they have ring singularities. These are "rings" of mass with zero width but some finite radius. Almost like a disk of no height. These rings of course can then have a tangential velocity. You were correct to be suspicious of a point singularity having tangential velocity though. That is not possible. 

How do we know our location? In determining location, because we exist in three dimensional space, we have to specify position with three coordinates. The simplest coordinate system in my mind, in terms of what we can measure, are the three coordinates below: 

I'm not entirely sure what your source of confusion is, so I'll just describe how temperature and degeneracy relate and hope that clears it up. Fermions All particles which are fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. They will resist doing so. What that really means, doesn't matter too much so for now, just accept it as an axiom. Electrons are fermions. A star, before it becomes a white dwarf, is filled with electrons just minding their own business. Then, as the star begins to form itself into a white dwarf, the crushing pressure of gravity squeezes all the electrons into a tight space. Gravity tries to push these electrons into the same quantum state, but the Pauli exclusion principle forbids this. Fermi Energy Note: The following is a gross over-simplication, but it gets the idea across without being too terribly wrong. Don't take it as gospel truth. You can define a set of all the possible quantum states. For simplicity, I'm just going to call them $\mathrm{state}\ 1$, $\mathrm{state}\ 2$, ..., $\mathrm{state}\ 67$, ..., $\mathrm{state}\ 10^{10483}$, etc. (ordered by energy). From above, we know each state can be occupied by only one electron. In general, these electrons will occupy a variety of non-sequential states. Pre-white dwarf, we might order the electrons by state and say
