Vertebrate tooth enamel is made from Hydroxylapatite, however this need not be the only material available that an alien species could use to make teeth or tooth-like structures. Given that an ideal tooth would be hard, strong and able to be precipitated biologically in-situ from commonly-available elements (rather than being found as is the case with gizzard stones), and would be in use by creatures with many differing diets, what substances would make the best teeth? Please support answers with a discussion of the likely appearance of the teeth, the relevant physical properties of the teeth such as hardness, strength and elasticity, as well as the substances that would be required in the creature's diet and/or environment to allow said teeth to develop. 

Yes, this is possible; the rotation that keeps the pole pointed toward the star would be considered to be precession. If this planet was in a close orbit around a red dwarf star, it would be close enough that it would be tidally locked, and gravity would provide the necessary torque, while remaining in the star's habitable zone. 

Exactly where do you emplace atomic devices in order to create a greater inflow of magma? How do you get them there without the heat damaging the warhead, since atomic weapons are quite sensitive pieces of equipment, and that much heat could distort or damage them to the point where they'd fizzle? Even if the warhead was insulated, how do you drill to that depth through such hot rock and magma? Considering the cross-section of Yellowstone from this page: Any necessary bore would have to be in excess of 10km deep, more likely 20-25km, and would also have to extend laterally up to 25km. Since the deepest manmade borehole is on the order of 12km, and the temperatures involved would be much higher, this would involve a breakthrough in drilling technology to achieve, since with current technology, this would be considered infeasible. Assuming that somehow you could calculate just how to nuke the rock below the Yellowstone magma pocket, and actually did so such that it experienced greater inflow of magma, how long would you be prepared to wait for sufficient heat and magma pressure to build up in order to cause an eruption? Unless the atomic devices causing the increase in magma inflow added a quite significant amount of energy to the system themselves, it could still be many months before the desired eruption could take place. If an eruption at Yellowstone was imminent in geological terms as well as human terms, geologists would have noticed steadily increasing levels of geothermal activity over the previous years. 23GT-worth of geothermal energy doesn't just accumulate overnight or even over the course of a single month. Geologists currently cannot predict the timing of a future eruption given present levels of activity, but if geothermal activity was observed to be increasing, it would be possible for geologists to model from the rate of increase an approximate timing for the eruption, to within a month or so. Since current research indicates that at a minimum it would take at least ten months for the Yellowstone system to accumulate enough energy to erupt, many people would have time to prepare or evacuate. 

Strength of the materials: Stronger materials can withstand more force before being damaged. Any mismatch between actuator and skeletal strength increases the likelihood of mechanical failure. Density of the materials: The lighter the materials, the less force will be required to move objects made from them. The maximum force that can be applied by the actuators per unit mass: The more force that can be applied per unit mass, the less will be needed to simply move the individual's limbs, and the more that can be applied to the environment. The internal friction of the actuators and joints. The higher, the less efficient - and slower - the humanoid will be. The maximum speed of the actuators. Additional speed can be achieved by chaining actuators in series, but increasing strength requires that they be placed in parallel. The lever ratio of the humanoid's joints: Higher strength means lower speed. The maximum allowable time for a joint to transition between fully flexed and fully extended: The humanoid might otherwise be immensely strong, yet unable to outpace a snail. The energy efficiency of the actuators. Less efficient actuators require more energy input - and generate more waste heat, limiting the maximum duration of maximum exertion, as well as limiting the maximum number of actuators for the available cooling capacity and thermal tolerance. Given that no mechanism is ever 100% efficient, by rights, if his muscles were just as efficient as ours, Superman ought to glow visibly from the waste heat when he applies his super strength, though perhaps that's where the heat for his eyes' heat rays comes from... The thermal tolerance of the humanoid: Raise a human's temperature more than a few degrees, and the efficiency and efficacy of all sorts of things is significantly reduced. The same applies to most physical systems outside a vacuum. The cooling capacity of the humanoid: Humans have amongst the best cooling capacity of any species on earth, allowing a sufficiently fit individual to literally run down members of most other terrestrial animal species solely on the basis that a human can maintain an optimum body temperature while running at a pace at which causes pretty much every other animal species' body temperature to increase. Keep this up long enough, and the prey's rising body temperature will eventually cause a physical collapse. Additionally, with insufficient internal heat redistribution capacity, local temperature differences could increase to the point where localised damage would occur. The humanoid's available energy and its maximum rate of delivery to the actuators: There's no point in having actuators that consume vast amounts of power if sufficient power cannot be supplied to them, or if sufficient power can be supplied, but not for a sufficient amount of time. Whether the humanoid's actuators require an input of energy only when changing position or if energy is required to maintain a given force - i.e. electric screw-jack vs a long-travel electromagnetic linear actuator; the former requires power only to change its position, while the latter requires (more) power to maintain a given position somewhere between fully extended and fully contracted, and less (or none) when at the limits of its travel: Animal muscles fall into the latter category, increasing the basal metabolic cost of things as simple as maintaining a static standing posture, but if a humanoid had actuators that fell into the former category, only actuators actively moving would consume power, though maintaining a standing posture can be a rather more active task than it might seem. The humanoid's optimum operating temperature: If this is too different from the environmental temperature, then energy must be expended to maintain - or achieve - it, or the humanoid will suffer from losses of efficiency or from mechanical failure if its internal cooling or heating capacity cannot keep up with the rate of heat transfer, which increases proportionally to the difference in temperature. The humanoid's skin's insulation factor. By reducing the speed at which heat is gained or lost, this can increase the efficiency of the humanoid at rest, but can hamper the task of dealing with waste heat. The environmental temperature: While the average temperature is important when optimising a real mechanical system, the range of variation is also important. The lower the range of variation, the easier it is to optimise a system to operate in those conditions. Being able to tolerate a wider variety of conditions can be useful in being able to survive, but also increases the cost of insulation and cooling, and systems that accept a narrower range of acceptable conditions have lower metabolic requirements than those that accommodate all possible conditions, though at the cost of an increased probability of exposure-related injury or death. The mass of any support equipment required to allow the humanoid to function independently for a reasonable amount of time. Unless this humanoid is like an evangelion with a cable to its power supply - which would have its own problems - it'll have to carry everything it needs around with it. If it needs a lot of energy, it better have a compact way of storing that energy. 

There could exist a situation where warfare was a tradition, where the targets of warfare were pre-agreed, and were the only legitimate targets, and where the forces employed were of pre-agreed sizes. This is different to limited or total war, where each side is trying to bring the conflict to a close by military means. Such a situation may exist where warfare is a religious rite that victory would make impossible to perform further - the object is to fight, perhaps to achieve personal victories, not to achieve a collective victory. Another possibility is that the leaders of the warring parties each encourage unending war in order to maintain their grip on power and profits - in fact they have a secret agreement to never seek victory in order to maintain the status quo. I would imagine such leaders to be somewhat Stalinesque in their propensity to execute those who ask too many questions or cast doubts on the leaders' judgement. 

My take on this is that there is an unusual environmental trigger for transformation from T-Phase to S-Phase. It may be so rare that only a few T-Phases encounter it naturally and are transformed, but S-Phases are smart enough to recognise this substance and deliberately administer it. Perhaps they can also cultivate or mine it, whatever it is. Anyway, there would need to be a trade-off in fitness with the T to S transformation. Perhaps this would require the growth of a larger brain, requiring the transforming T to eat more of a particular type of food, and if enough of this food could not be obtained, the transformation might abort or go wrong. Perhaps having a larger brain and no training would lead to inadvisable curiosity that would be more likely to lead to deaths than had the transformation not taken place at all. This would mean that you'd have your necessity for training new S-phase individuals, rather than just selecting them all for brain expansion, and only training those you could handle. 

Still, despite all these limitations and problems, if they could be overcome, it would change lamiae from a slow, lumbering species with poor endurance to the fastest, longest-distance cursorial species the world has yet seen, humans included. 

We have one criterion already which pretty much dictates a certain set of psychological traits: Stone Age to Renaissance technological development. It might not seem much, but this criterion dictates quite a lot about a being's psychology. It is not really possible to move beyond the stone age without sociability. In order to develop renaissance-level technology, these beings must co-operate with one-another, which means some sort of communication, leading to social grooming (of whatever variety) in order to defuse conflicts which may lead to violence or avoidance. However, the definition of 'social grooming' can be quite broad. Humans mostly make small-talk, but can also have sex. Dogs sniff each-others' backsides. Cats sniff noses. Bonobos have sex. Chimpanzees and many monkeys literally groom each-other (hence the term 'social grooming'). Whatever form you choose for your protagonists' social grooming, it must exist, and your story will likely be better for you knowing what it is and how they do it. Secondly, these beings must be able to comprehend and practise economic principles. Without this, they will either over-consume to the point where they starve themselves and suffer a major population crash, or will not have sufficient motivation to better themselves with improved technology at the other extreme, that of frugality. There are exceptions, of course. You may have a species that is unable to practise birth-control for whatever reason, and therefore undergoes periodic population crashes as resources are exhausted and fought over (consider the Moties from The Mote in God's Eye), yet are still able to develop technology. However, as it is stated that warfare is not the prime focus (of the story nor, we can presume, the society), this is unlikely - hence our presumption of knowledge and practise of economic principles, as well as a certain degree of birth-control, either natural-biological or artificial. Another option is that the protagonist species is itself predated upon by a physically superior carnivore species, thus providing natural population control, but this option becomes less relevant as technology improves, unless the species is an r-strategist, and expects to lose a lot of offspring. All things considered (though coming from the bias of a K-selected species, namely humans), K-selected species are more likely to produce civilisations, yet the converse is not impossible. However, a r-selected species would likely be less sympathetic to a human audience. Who would sympathise with characters who give birth to whole broods of offspring, then basically neglect them, not lifting a manipulatory appendage to prevent them from being eaten by a variety of eager predators, until they grew up enough to become worthy of inclusion in society? It may be possible to make said scenario sympathetic, but the life-story of K-selected species would inherently be more sympathetic to us. The question mentions love. This may or may not be a necessity, and too much may be worse than none at all. It is possible to have a perfectly well-functioning technological society without love, where reproduction takes place on some schedule or in response to some environmental trigger, and the operative emotion during reproductive events is lust. In biological terms, love binds breeding members together in order to provide for offspring, and can be expected to occur primarily in K-strategists. However, why is too much love bad? In species where pair-bonding is for life, the bonds between partners are so strong that they instinctively reject other members of their own species, reducing the likelihood that sufficient co-operation could be mustered to establish a technological society. It isn't impossible, just unlikely. Now, to warfare. It may not be the primary focus of the intended story, but it is all too likely to exist in a species with an appetite for resources and technology. Warfare typically takes place in response to competition for limited resources, though in humans at least, it can also take place in response to competing ideologies. It is possible to design a species that would not consider fighting for beliefs, but the strict limitations of economics dictates that some form of conflict or drama will occur in response to an insufficient supply of resources, whether that is some form of competition for those resources or a concession within the society that the resources are unattainable in the desired quantities, and the compromises that must be made to reduce the demand for them to sustainable and equitable levels. However, a species that has the drive to develop technology is quite likely a species that is willing to fight over resources if not also their beliefs. It has been shown from human history that warfare has been a major impetus in the development of technology - in those areas where conflict is rare, technology tends to be simpler than where conflict is frequent. However, while warfare need not be the focus of a story, a good story should acknowledge that it exists and consider the impacts of warfare on the non-combatant protagonists. Additionally, while it was not stated in the question, I should point out that warfare tends to be concentrated to areas with many natural boundaries between regions; social groups form where movement and communication is easiest, and conflict occurs across natural boundaries where the society on the other side is 'not like us' in some - or many - respects. Places with wide-open plains tend to be more peaceful than places with many natural barriers, leading to a technological disparity in favour of the societies who are more frequently in conflict with one-another. Given these guidelines, if a question was to be asked with a more specific set of personality traits, I would have a better chance of designing a biology to fit it. 

In some sense, almost every system of government can be equated to a dictatorship to some degree, in that it is necessary for the area and populace governed to abide by the rulings of the government in order to maintain stability. Since the question does not specify that this is a human government, I will begin by assuming a human government, then discuss the options for non-humans. Humans in small tribal societies are typically governed by groups of elders, who by their years of experience, can remember situations in the past corresponding to current situations. As settlements grow beyond a single tribe, and as trade increases in volume, it becomes necessary to keep records. It is from such a necessity for record keeping that writing is invented or imported. In the early days of a society's adventure into literacy, only a few individuals will be literate, and not necessarily the leaders. Since in this scenario, a single tribe has had an influx of people from other tribes, there would still be multiple leaders. A single leader is unlikely to arise without some sort of external stimulus such as a war, since any tendency toward dictatorial behavior would simply lead to the populace leaving for a place with a less unreasonable leadership, or removal of the would-be dictator. In the event of a war, however, it is of benefit to a society to have a single overall military leader, as this reduces the duration of the decision cycle and ensures that response times to threats are minimized. Societies that have experienced large-scale war are more likely at that point to develop a monarchy and an aristocracy based on military position, as humans tend to want to retain whatever authority they gain. In fact, outright totalitarian dictatorships amongst humans are pretty rare. It takes a strong-willed and ruthless individual to achieve and maintain such a position, and such people are often the subject of assassination attempts and rebellions, so most forms of government that remain functional over time take some notice of the opinions and needs of the population that they govern. As to alien societies, the psychology of the species must be taken into consideration. A herd-based species may have many leaders, even if they practice a form of sexual dominance, as any individual spending time becoming the dominant member of their gender is almost by definition not spending it being a good administrator. A dictator under these circumstances would be practically unthinkable. An individualistic species would have forms of government not too dissimilar from humans if they had a tendency to be gregarious, but again a dictatorship would be unlikely to arise. The traits that would most encourage a dictatorship would be a situation where the members of a species had some differences in intelligence levels, for example, if the old were much more intelligent than the young, or if there was a "brain" caste. In such a situation, the best thinker would make a natural leader.
