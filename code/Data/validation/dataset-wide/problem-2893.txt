I think mathematics has taught us that 'foundations' are an inappropriate way to think of intellectual structures. The 'foundation' of mathematics from a functional point of view is really more around the 'middle'. It is really based in geometry and number theory, things humans easily grasp. But those seem complicated in other ways, so there are deep attempts to construct everything from very basic concepts. A short way in, these attempts just flushed out Russell's Paradox, which pointed out that what we look at as very basic concepts are, in fact, quite complicated in other ways. Physics, and all the other sciences have the same problem, but it is in some ways both more obvious and easier to hide. We agree that physics is constructed by agreement of those practicing it, in a way that mathematics does not seem, at least on the surface, to be. We can look at mass or gravitation as a more basic concept, we can prefer to consider either charge or nuclear composition a simpler way of seeing things. 'Down' in complexity is clearly more relative. But at the same time, within the field if physics, the idea that 'down' really exists somehow persists better. As we see particles and integrating theories become more and more embedded in assumptions about the more complex processes that are used to detect them and prove their existence, it does not occur to us that we are getting deeply embedded in layers of assumptions. Each layer seems so obvious and clear. They are the same sets of assumptions we rely on to keep our day-to-day technology working, so why would we question them? Only when something really deep goes 'wrong' do we question this kind of thing: when we cannot rush into a beam of light and see our relative velocities add up; when we need something continuous to act less like a continuum in order for there not to be infinitely much heat created by a finite quantity of entropy. Then we need extensions of theories that really seem to almost destroy the theories themselves. Kuhn's model of paradigms captures this well. Faced with a theory that eats itself in this manner, we renegotiate what is more basic, and what is more derived, so that we can rearrange our view of the subject and get a sense of complete coverage back. In the process, we discover some of what we thought was reliable data is just wrong, or that we no longer have ways of explaining it. In that sense, all of these theoretical constructs could be totally reframed in completely different terms if the discoveries that created them happened in different orders, and were rearranged on different terms. They very well may be rearranged extensively in the future. This puts science in the same position where Set Theory put math: what is common experience is really what needs to be maintained as the 'foundation' of the science, the part that cannot be lost in a shift of paradigms. The things that scientists within the field see as 'more basic' are in fact almost infinitely renegotiable and likely to be seen differently in some future generation. There is in that sense no 'downward' direction in complexity in any science. 

In what definition is 'not as good as' only functional or aesthetic and not a moral judgement? I don't think we can negotiate that boundary, not because it is complex, but because it is imaginary. Even if I find one kind of jam not as good as another, I am expressing the opinion that the canner might have done better, or that her employer (or God) might have provided her better materials. And many such people would feel morally wounded by such accusations, as though it were not an objective evaluation, but a commentary on their level of dedication, whether they deserve their place in the world, or some other marker they would accord moral value. Even if that is a very light judgment and rendered relative with a little thought, it is at base moral -- ask any three-year old: in such a case the world has wronged them by not having better jam. And ask someone who actually makes jam whether or not that feels like a moral accusation. They may not be offended if you do not find it as sweet, or as thick, but 'as good' has moral content. We learn to accommodate a world of moral relativism, but we are still making judgments about taste, the value of our work, our family loyalty and tribal preferences in a moral sense. We work to pull the fabric of society into agreement with our emotional reactions, rather than the other way around, and the result is moral action. At a more adult level, watch musicians or writers compose together some time, and try to imagine they are not defending moral ground. The reactions are the same, the responses are the same, the tactics are the same. The results often affect the audience in the same way as a moral argument: creating empathy or evoking rage. I would suggest that racism is that kind of aesthetic moral sense that has not allowed itself to be muted by a wider morality of fairness or logical comparison. Onto that basic skeleton of reactions, we hang exceptions and other texture to make it possible to compromise with fairness or objective observations on a superficial level -- we make up stories about black athletics and escape from ravening beasts, or centuries of Jewish domination of arithmetic in the Middle Ages, to escape the notion "ours" are not in fact better in some core capacity unaffected by "their" historical advantages. If I am a middle-class Japanese girl trying playing funk for a living, that kind of story is not just misleading, it is immoral (especially if I am this one $URL$ 

If time is not flowing forward, how exactly is that time? At the same time, if time is what allows for change, how can it move, including any sort of "flowing"? If it isn't moving, what is this forward and backward thing? This is just a vocabulary problem. It is possible that the second law of thermodynamics is a side effect of the fact that human memory is an exothermic chemical reaction, rather than the other way around. It is further possible that not all beings that accumulate information are tied to the directionality of chemical processes in the same way. But that is not the same question. Boltzmann at some point proposed that we experience time consistently because we are near an event of very low entropy, that we were being driven into higher entropy by falling away from a specific part of space. But even that somewhat lacks cohesion, in what way are we falling? It seems more consistent to assume that the accumulation of entropy continually reversed itself along some other dimension, but we can only remember the last time it moved forward for us. Any other approach ties two dimensions up too tightly, which makes the physics of thermodynamics a little idiosyncratic to be realistic. Either time is the accumulation of entropy, or it is something else, or it is just coincidentally both, and we never needed to consider it as 'flowing' one direction or the other. But if it can only go forward or backward, it is just too special to be real. The separation here makes some sense: if the last instant is not always the same copy of that point in "the other dimension of time", but our time has reversed back through it and come back forward, traversing some part of that 'other place', that leaves a convenient way to imagine a determinate, reversible, quantum mechanics that leads to superficial randomness. In "The Elegant Universe" Green mentions predecessors to our current string theory that proposed five spatial dimensions and two temporal ones (which can be wound up into a single complex number, if one insists, as Stephen Hawking seems to). So this is not an entirely inane consideration. But we need some way to think of what is or might be going on here as something other than time, or we need a broader conception of what a dimension is. (Otherwise, people will keep asking this same, silly question in this same silly form, which leads nowhere.) 

As American patent law sees it, you still have the right to use your idea independent of them. It is 'prior art' and they cannot monopolize it. But you have no right to any part of their success. They are the ones who have made the investment in your idea. You already had the opportunity to take your idea to someone else who would make that investment in a way that would benefit you, instead of them. If you did not recognize the value of your own idea, they deserve the benefit of that realization, which you did not have. 'Capitalism' is the name for a market economy, but the primary thing markets acknowledge is not the holding of capital. Money is no longer based on actual property, it is now an entirely market phenomenon, based on the recycling of debt. So modern markets run on the successful estimation of value and a proper sense of the associated risk. You did not properly estimate the value, or take the related risk. 

Aristotle, the first person to write inclusively about logic, had a definite opinion on the subject. In the original system of syllogisms, these two 'weird' statements are not true, the first one is false and the second is undetermined. Later in the history of logic, mathematicians simplified deduction by injecting our new 'iffier' version of 'if', and scientists and some of the general public just came along, because it greatly improves the efficiency of the system. Traditionally, the rule of induction known as modus ponens is "From A, when A implies B, Deduce B", it says nothing about when A is false, and it doubts the meaningfulness of "A implies B" when A is false or unknown. Similarly, Aristotle did not believe that there is only a single important quantifier "For All" and its dual "There Exists". If you do not use the simpler version of 'if', you need at least four: "All", "No", "Some", and "Not Every". But the new mathematical logic was precise and efficient enough to diagnose that its own paradoxes really are unavoidable (it is not that they are absent from Aristotle, just harder to see.) In light of these problems, one response is Intuitionism, which wants to see mathematics as something more psychological than we currently do. If math is really psychology, the scientific study of human abstraction, and not just advanced accounting, or some blessedly pure domain whose subject matter lies beyond the stars, then we need to pay more attention to your feeling of 'weirdness'. This approach revives the notion of doubting the meaningfulness of "A implies B" when A is unknown or false. But no one wants to lose the 'slickness' of modern logic that would result if we changed back the meaning of 'if' and accepting the extra complexities of Aristotelian quantification. Instead, they accommodated the psychology by weakening our notion of negation, rejecting the principle known as tertium non datur, or the Law of the Excluded Middle, "What is not true is false. There is no third option". Psychologically, it is not really convincing to humans that everything that is not true must be false. It is not true that all unicorns are white, but it is not really false either, given that there are no unicorns. The implication about Gates and the moon is neither true nor false. At the same time, we do not have the same problem with the idea that if unicorns were white then they would be black. That seems clearly false. "A implies not A" is still "not A or not A" which is still "not A". When A = "Gates is false", the psychological reaction, and Aristotle's, is the right one in intuitionistic logic. So this system accepts the new meaning of 'if' and still backs up the feeling that your first statement is not true, and your second statement is not certain, but changing the meaning of 'not' in such a way that these statements are not true, but they are also not false. It can be interpreted as a case of a more general concept of modality in logic. "True" can have multiple meanings in the same system, with different bases of reference. "Tertium non datur" may be true in (macroscopic) physics, and it can still be consistent, given strict rules about things like abstractly-defined collections not being real. But it is not true in fiction. So that physics is using a specific mode of interpretation and fiction or intuitionistic mathematics is using a different one. They give up different things in order to feel safe from nonsense. You can't have it all, or you get a bunch of paradoxes that prevent you from working efficiently. But you can safely do different jobs differently.
