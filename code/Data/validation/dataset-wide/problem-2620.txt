The eight precepts version is for laypersons who want to lead a more ascetic life. So, if your question is generally about entertainment, then it depends on whether you wish to observe the five or the eight precepts. Naturally, the eight precepts are more conducive to the path of Enlightenment, but we should not use this to forbid or discourage laypersons from watching entertainment. Laypersons are only discouraged (strongly) from the five (killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech and substance intoxication). The prose seems to come from The Gospel of Ramakrishna. 

At least in the Theravada tradition, it is emphasized that the role of the Buddha (technically the Samyaksambuddha) was to teach and establish the dhamma. And he was also the most qualified person to do it. The dhamma (teachings) is like a shortcut that we received from the Buddha, which we need to first study and understand. Studying involves understanding the Four Noble Truths, the Three Marks of Existence, and other teachings found in the suttas. Practice includes the Five Precepts and the Noble Eightfold Path. The Noble Eightfold Path includes Right View and Right Intention (which comes in part through studying), as well as Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration and Right Effort (which is meditation and practice). The remaining three are also part of practice. So, if you do not want to study, but only want to practise meditation, then you are not making use of the "shortcut" teachings of the Buddha and instead want to find enlightenment by yourself. For a good introduction on the teachings, I recommend What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula. You can find the PDF version here. There is also a very short collection of the suttas at the back of the book. The Tripitakas are rather huge. But a good anthology or selection of suttas can be found in In the Buddha's Words by Bhikku Bodhi. You can find the PDF version here. If you find studying Buddhism potentially daunting, then these two books should help you get started. 

The same sutta explains that thoughts and actions must not be motivated by greed, aversion and delusion. The so-called "three poisons" are the criteria to determine whether they are right or not. 

So, you don't have to wait till the "next world", bad companions and bad practices can affect you in this life itself. The same sutta explains the effects caused by intoxicating substances: 

You're probably thinking of the Bahiya Sutta (Udana 1.10). Once there was a bark-clad ascetic Bahiya who thought he was enlightened, but a deva told him that he wasn't and asked him to seek out the Buddha for his guidance. He found the Buddha who gave him a brief instruction, which resulted in his near-immediate enlightenment. Very shortly after that, he was killed in a freak accident. The Buddha said that Bahiya became totally unbound (i.e. enlightened). What did the Buddha teach him? (translated by Thanissaro) 

Since the Buddha made speaking the truth a very important precept, it is obvious that he couldn't be lying when he said that he saw with his divine eye, the truth of rebirth, where, with the break-up of the body, after death, beings reappear in other destinations. The phrase "break-up of the body" shows that it is not a metaphorical death. 

You misread the story. Mara did not win over the Buddha. Rather, Mara successfully influenced Ananda, to not request the Buddha to extend his life, when the Buddha dropped the hint that he could choose to extend his life, because he had the ability to do so. Parinibbana Sutta 

The advice given by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo in his essay "The Skill of Release" should be helpful to you: 

I see the desire for companionship as a type of sensual craving (kama tanha). When you engage in social media and obtain the pleasure of companionship and entertainment by chatting with others, you could increase this craving. When you imagine pleasures you could enjoy, by watching the lives of other people, who delight themselves in things that you have not, again, you could increase this craving. When you watch others, you could also experience the craving to become like them (bhava tanha). When craving is not met, it leads to negative feelings. In this case, when the craving for companionship is not satisfied, it leads to loneliness. 

If you eat vegetables or grains, it can indirectly cause the death of animals like snails and earthworms, due to clearing of land, ploughing, pesticides, weeding etc. If you wear clothes made of cotton, it can indirectly cause the death of animals like snails and earthworms, due to clearing of land, ploughing, pesticides, weeding etc. If you use banknotes made of paper, or buy or use anything made of paper, it can indirectly cause the death of animals, when trees got chopped down for the manufacturing of paper. If you use any plastics or fuel for your car or banknotes made of polymer, it can indirectly cause the death of animals due to drilling for petroleum and gas. If you throw rubbish away, it can indirectly cause the death of animals, because some of that trash ends up in the sea or landfills. If you buy anything metal (including all electronics), it can indirectly cause the death of animals due to mining. If you drink treated water from the tap, it can indirectly cause the death of small animals from the process of filtration and chlorination. If you use electricity, it can indirectly cause the death of animals from the process of clearing land for building hydroelectric dams, or the billowing of smoke from a plant that burns hydrocarbons. When you pay any kind of taxes, even indirectly e.g. through purchasing goods, the money from it may be used by the government to buy weapons and train soldiers for killing humans. Basically, the Buddha taught that to break the first precept, you must have the intention to kill and then actually kill. This applies to directly causing the deprivation of life. For e.g. hitting a mosquito would be directly killing it. By buying frozen meat or vegetables from the supermarket, or using paper or banknotes or wearing clothes or drinking treated water or using electricity or using electronics (including the computer or smartphone you are reading this on), you did not have any intention to kill anyone and you did not in fact kill anyone. Therefore, you do not break the first precept this way. 

The view of Buddhism is different - please see below. The Buddhist view is not about hastening the "burning up" of past karma or avoiding creation of new karma. Rather, it's about putting an end to dependent origination, through ceasing craving and uprooting the ten fetters. This is done through the Noble Eightfold Path. The Parable of the Salt Crystal from the Lonaphala Sutta: 

The Adiya Sutta talks about the five types of benefits that can be obtained from wealth, which are summarized below: 

What is the difference between the concept of emptiness (Śūnyatā in Sanskrit, or suññatā in Pali) in the Theravada tradition and the concept of emptiness in the Mahayana tradition? From my basic understanding, Theravada emptiness is only regarding the self, while Mahayana emptiness is regarding all things. Is this true? Or does Theravada also teach the emptiness of all things (e.g. in the sutta about foam and bubbles)? Are these (Theravada emptiness and Mahayana emptiness) really completely different, or at some level, do they allude to the same thing? For Theravada, could it be, that the emptiness of self is important for the path to ending suffering, but the emptiness of all things is not important for the path to ending suffering (as per the Parable of the Poisoned Arrow and the Parable of the Leaves in the Forest)? I found the following quote from this answer interesting: 

It would be useful to be very precise about what we mean by "pride" and "shame". Wikipedia mentions these relevant terms from the Theravada Abhidharma tradition: The unwholesome mental factors (akusala cetasikas) include: 

There is a YouTube video where Ajahn Brahm, abbot of the Bodhinyana Monastery in Western Australia, talked about the time he thought he may have become enlightened. This was in Thailand, when he was still a junior monk. In this story, he said that after a long period of meditation (some days), he woke up in a state of intense bliss. He thought he may have become enlightened. Later, he went to get alms. There was food distributed to the monks, including one small pot of delicious food (I think it was pork curry), and another big pot of unappetizing food (I think it was stinky fermented fish stew). Pork curry was a rare special treat, while the stinky fish stew is something ordinary. Both were distributed to a group of monks. The most senior monk gets to take his food first. He took only the delicious pork curry for himself, and then he poured the remaining contents of the small pot into the big pot and mixed them together, saying, "They are all the same. As monks, we must not be choosy." Having not eaten for several days, Bhikkhu Brahm was hungry. Seeing the senior monk's actions, he became angry, but did not say anything to him. Then he thought, "if I became angry, then I'm definitely not enlightened." Epilogue: The moral of the story is that the fetters (samyojana) are very deep-rooted and deep-seated, that feelings of bliss may temporarily mask the fetters. They are most probably still there and one would not be enlightened yet. Blissful feelings and jhanas could be easily mistaken for enlightenment. This message is echoed in the Atthinukhopariyaayo Sutta (or alternative translation). 

The purpose of that precept is to prevent loss of heedfulness through intoxication. If your reason to drink tea of some kind with very little alcohol in it, is for medicinal purposes, and if it does not cause the loss of heedfulness through intoxication, then there is no violation of the precept in my opinion. 

The second useful sutta is the Acintita Sutta which states that the precise working out of karma cannot be conjectured: 

If we look at the Wikipedia articles, we find that all major Mahayana concepts do not contain a Self (the definition of which can be found in Glasenapp's essay). The Wikipedia statements below come with citations. On the Eternal Buddha: 

The article you quoted, amply describes Nibbana using 33 phrases, from Samyutta Nikaya 43. I can't tell you how to know if you have attained Nibbana. But I can tell you how to know if you have not attained Nibbana - you would be afflicted with one or more of the ten fetters. Even if you have experienced a little of one of these, even once today, you've not yet reached "the other shore" which is "taintless", "peaceful", "sublime" and "deathless". These are: 

Above, you can see that the fifth and sixth bardos are located between death and rebirth. However, the Theravada view according to Ven. Narada Mahathera from his book The Buddha and His Teachings, chapter 28: 

From a Theravada perspective, in order to attain Nibbana (the fourth and final stage of enlightenment), you generally need to pass through the first stage of enlightenment, which is the fruit of stream entry. In this YouTube video, Ven. Dhammavuddho explains the characteristics of a sotapanna (stream winner) and explains how to get there. He quotes from many suttas to support his points. 

Enjoyment of wealth, beauty, status etc. are all sensual experiences that can be positive, if one pursues a meritorious and virtuous life. But of course, nothing is permanent. Suffering continues. All wealth, beauty, status, heavan etc. are not permanent. After all, sensual desires (kāmachanda), one of the ten fetters, still applies to stream winners and once-returners. So it's not bad in itself. We can say that sensuality (kāmachanda) combined with virtues (sila) is part of the middle way. To say all sensuality is bad, falls into over-asceticism, away from the middle way. 

In the Kukkuravatika Sutta (MN57), there are two ascetics who talk to the Buddha. One ascetic (Seniya) had taken the vow to live like a dog and the other (Punna) had taken the vow to live like a cow. Punna asked the Buddha what would be Seniya's future destiny, having taken the dog vow, and the Buddha replied: 

Your question is not about whether past life actions influence present life circumstances. For that, see this answer and this sutta. Rather, you are asking if your past life thoughts, affect your present life thoughts (or thought choices). In a single lifetime, the answer is yes according to Dvedhavitakka Sutta. 

You have confused the jhana states to a progression towards enlightenment. This was taught by other teachers before Buddha attained enlightenment and he was not satisfied. From MN26: 

The Buddha did not say that there is no self at all. That is a common misunderstanding of anatta. A recurring theme in the Buddha's teachings is the middle way between eternalism and annihilationism. With respect to the self, annihilationism is the idea that there is no self at all (see SN44.10). In fact, the Buddha rubbished that idea in the Attakari Sutta: 

The solution you proposed to end craving, is by extreme asceticism, which the Buddha found did not work. The other extreme end, which is extreme indulgence, also does not work. So, he discovered the Middle Way of practice between extreme asceticism and extreme indulgence, known as the Noble Eightfold Path. The main scriptural source for this, is the Discourse on the Setting of the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion. Within the Noble Eightfold Path, there are 4 levels of training - lay follower of the teachings, the anagarika (sort of a pre-monk), the novice monk or nun, and the fully ordained monk or nun. Each of these 4 levels of training are increasing in degree of intensity but are still within the Middle Way and the Noble Eightfold Path. You can find some details in this answer. The life of a fully ordained monk or nun is not considered to be one of extreme asceticism, because it does not deny them food, clothing, shelter and companionship. Regarding guarding the sense doors, the answer comes from the Aparihani Sutta: 

Offering of alms to monks and nuns is likely different in Buddhist minority countries, compared to Buddhist majority countries. Please see this page by the Buddhist Society of Western Australia (BSWA), for a guide on offering food to the Sangha of BSWA. Please see this page by the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in Hertfordshire, England, for a similar guide. Please see this page by the Sirimangalo International Monastery and Meditation Centre in Ontario, Canada, for a similar guide. The three monasteries mentioned above are based on the Thai Theravada tradition. 

Metta is wishing for all beings to be happy and be at ease. Looking at women as mothers is not metta. But I can find a reverse-mother reference for metta below. The metta practitioner should feel loving-kindness towards all beings just as a mother would want to protect her only child. Metta can be used to counter one's own impulse to cause harm or unhappiness to others by considering the welfare and happiness of others. From the Karaniya Metta Sutta: 

A few Upanishads are pre-Buddhist but the majority came later. Most of the Vedas were however pre-Buddhist. The Buddha definitely rejected the idea of the Atman (an indivisible indestructible eternal self at the core of beings) and he also rejected the concept of eternalism. Atman and eternalism are core doctrines of the Upanishads. Not just this, there are rituals that are either contained in or derived from the Vedas like the following (from this site): 

The eight precepts, which are the stricter version, tells one, in addition, to undertake the training to abstain from: 

At least from a Theravadin perspective of the Buddha's teachings, the world and everything in it are not an illusion. However, they are not constant, not permanent and subject to change. This is anicca. Therefore you should not feel that the world and the people around you are illusions and that you are, in some sense, alone, and make yourself depressed. The self is also existent and is not an illusion. However, the self is not an independently existing entity or agent, but rather arises out of the inter-workings of the five aggregates. A working wristwatch is composed of various parts such as the battery, strap, housing, glass cover, needles, gears etc. but doesn't exist as a standalone entity apart from these. It appears as a working wristwatch only when all these things work together. It is the same with the self. This is anatta. Therefore, you should not feel that you yourself are some kind of illusion and make yourself crazy. All these exist, but are not constant or permanent or absolute. However, there is also suffering, because of pain, disease and death. Suffering due to the inconstancy of everything that makes us happy, including the people that we love. Suffering because we cannot always avoid things that make us unhappy. This is dukkha. You wrote that "I am afraid of never being able to come back", therefore displaying that you have the craving to be (bhava tanha) - you want to exist. Therefore, you should not feel trapped in this existence. After all, you are here, because you want to be here. And as long as you have this craving, you will definitely continue to be here in this life and future lives. This is one of the causes of suffering. One type of craving. But there are also other types of craving like sensual pleasures. The Yamaka Sutta (SN22.85) is very suited to the next part of your question on the fear of enlightenment. The monk Yamaka once had this wrong view:
