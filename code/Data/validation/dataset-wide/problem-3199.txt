I don't know of any issued weapons that were automatically fatal for the users, although there were several that were quite dangerous. The Soviet RPG-43 was a shaped-charge hand grenade. This required getting within throwing range of a tank, and was also quite difficult to use correctly. The British Blacker Bombard had a range of only about 100 yards and frequently threw fragments back towards the weapon crew if it hit. However, it was probably less dangerous than the Smith Gun which killed several crew without ever seeing action against the enemy, or the Northover Projector, whose incendiary ammunition tended to break and ignite inside the weapon. The most dangerous of the early-war British anti-tank weapons was probably the "Sticky Bomb", which tried to glue a powerful explosive charge to a tank, with a five-second delay fuse for the user to take cover. It was replaced later in the war by the Gammon Bomb, which was still pretty dangerous, but was used to kill several tanks in Normandy. Additions for Japan: they used flamethrowers as anti-tank weapons a few times, with some success, but they don't seem to have issued bombs on poles. The easiest way to improvise one would be to attach a Type 99 mine to a sturdy stick. They also had a cheap shaped-charge anti-tank grenade, the Type 3 which could have been used in a hand-to-hand attack on a tank. I don't know if this ever actually happened; you'd need a very detailed history or personal memoirs to find out. 

Since you have changed your question I will reply directly to the question you have posed. The oldest fragments of manuscripts of parts of the New Testament are not older than the first quarter of the second century. 

The general term in Ptolemaic astronomy is kyklos (cycle), which encompasses the epikyklos, the ekkentros kyklos etc. 

At least in prescriptive religious texts, Islam rejects the practice of bowing down to anyone but God, and the canonic report about the prophet’s delegation to Ethiopia specifically states that the Muslims refused to bow down to the Negus, but none the less found favour with him. (I am citing this not as a real historic event but as a normative religious statement). I suspect therefore that Maimonides is referring not to Muslim kings of his own time, but to the assumed situation at the time of the ancient Israelite kings. 

How democratic was the Roman republic? Slaves couldn’t vote; Women couldn’t vote; You had to own property… How democratic was the American republic? Slaves couldn’t vote; Indians couldn’t vote; Women couldn’t vote; You had to own property… Maybe a better question would be: What actually is democracy? 

There is nobody remotely as famous as Benedict Arnold who switched sides to the Americans while the conflict was in progress. The whole business is considered far less significant in British history than it is in American, for obvious reasons. There was a saboteur, "Jack the Painter" whom I think I might have heard of before I went looking for candidates, but that's the most famous person I can find. 

No. Several people had the idea of an attractive force, and some of them of an inverse square law. Newton worked the idea out in detail, and showed that it produced results that matched the observations of the solar system: he made gravity into a proper scientific theory, rather than a vague hypothesis. Wikipedia's article on Hooke has a good account of his contributions to the idea. 

My best source for this is Richard B. Frank's book Guadalcanal, which doesn't mention Ghormley receiving the reports. However, requiring the reports to be routed through Ghormley to Turner would have been foolish; it was undoubtedly correct for McCain to send his reports directly to Turner. This is because Ghormley was 900 miles away, in Nouméa, New Caledonia. With the shortwave radio of the time, nobody could rely on messages getting there and back promptly. They'd be sure to make it after a while (via repeated attempts), but imposing unknown delays on information with potential tactical importance would have been silly. Ghormley got many things wrong in the Guadalcanal campaign, but most of the blame for the disastrous Battle of Savo Island must go to the British Rear-Admiral Crutchley, who was in command of the forces guarding against Japanese surface action from that direction, and failed to organise them properly, or tell his subordinates where he was, and thus who was in command. 

The answer to your question depends on what exactly you consider to be an “official” national anthem. However, a case can be made for the priority of “God save the King”, first performed in 1745. Second place probably goes to the Marseillaise, which was officially adopted as the hymn of the French Republic in 1795. In the same year (1795) the great Austrian composer Haydn returned home from a long stay in England, where he had been much impressed by the fact that the English had such a sprightly national hymn, so much so that in 1797 he composed a national (or imperial) hymn for his own country, setting a pre-existing text (“Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser”). This is still the Austrian national anthem. In 1841 the German nationalist poet Hoffmann von Fallersleben took Haydn’s melody as the basis for his Deutschlandlied (“Deutschland, Deutschland über alles”). This did not officially become the German national anthem until 1922, when it was elevated to that rank by the Weimar Republic. It remains the German national anthem to this day (though the atrocious first verse is not normally sung in public at present). You can find some more information in the wikipedia article "Deutschlandlied", more detailed in the German version. 

Arthur Zimmerman appears to have been trying to avoid being blamed by the German press and politicians for bringing the USA into the war. Placing your personal interests ahead of those of your country when you're a government minister is rarely a good idea. He said: 

It was foreseen that there would be new wars, and that the alliance system meant that there was real potential for a war to involve most of Europe. Otto von Bismarck said in 1897 "One day the great European War will come out of some damned foolish thing in the Balkans." and he was generally recognised as having a very acute understanding of European politics and the boundaries between peace and war. However, nobody anticipated that the war would take the shape that it did. It was not realised just how effective defence had become, with the fairly new technologies of barbed wire and machine guns, nor that the industrial age allowed moving huge armies rapidly, and supplying them adequately. Nor did anyone believe that opposition troops could take the losses they did and carry on fighting (everyone believed their own troops were steadfast, but not anyone else's). Nobody understood that cavalry was obsolete on the battlefield, or believed that unrestricted submarine warfare would break out, or really knew how to manage a vast system of convoys, or manoeuvre large fleets in poor visibility. They didn't anticipate gas warfare, or flamethrowers, or aerial warfare, or the other expedients that would be tried to break out of the deadly embrace in which the armies of the Western Front held each other. War was anticipated, but not the scale of the tragedy that WWI became. It changed Europe greatly, and its after-effects are not yet over. 

Mozart’s childhood name was “Wolferl”, a south German and Austrian diminutive of “Wolfgang”. “Wolfie” is merely an attempt to translate this into English. $URL$ 

Euclid, like other ancient authors, would probably have dictated his books to a literate slave, who wrote them down on wax tables, with a stylus, as Tyler has described. The tablets would then have been passed on to a professional scribe (also a slave), who copied them on to scrolls made of papyrus. 

To say – as you do in the superscription – that Latin American countries “participated” in the Second World War is a gross overstatement. None of the Latin American took part in the fighting to any significant extent. Most of the countries in Latin America did declare war on Germany at a time when the outcome of the war was already clear. They simply wanted to be on the side of the victors. 

There is no singular event, or main type of event, that aligns ancient with modern calendars. Ancient calendars tended to be somewhat arbitrary, numbering by years of the current king's reign, or similarly unpredictable things. The Babylonian records of eclipses, planetary conjunctions, and the like allow their calendar to be aligned with certainty because there are so many events that match up. Aligning other ancient calendars that don't have so many associated astronomical events takes detective work. For example, you might have several possibilities from eclipses of the moon, and be able to pick one from a record of a trading expedition to Babylon that mentions who the king of Babylon was at the time. 

I became aware of the Cold War and the risks of a nuclear war in the late seventies. Most people in the UK didn't worry about it often, but it was always there. I particularly remember the night of the KAL007 shoot-down, September 1st, 1983. I got home late, turned on the radio to BBC World Service and heard the news. I stayed up for a while to see if the situation would escalate, but when that didn't seem to be happening, I went to bed, not sure if there would be a morning. 

What about World War I, and specifically Britain versus Germany? Both were parliamentary democracies with robust opposition parties, a relatively free press, rule of law, independent judiciaries, but in both cases with a superimposed hereditary monarchy. 

Colonialism in its strict and historic sense means the practice of settling a large number of colonists in subject countries, as did the British in North America, Ireland, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zeeland, the French in Algeria, the Spanish and Portuguese in Latin America, the Russians in virtually all of their annexed territories, and many parallel examples in the pre-modern world. In this strict sense the Ottoman Turks did not practice colonialism; they did not send significant numbers of Turks to live in conquered lands. The Ottoman Empire was, however, an imperial power which ruled a large number of foreign countries against the will of the native population 

This question is very vague, but I assume you are asking about the Middle Ages in Western Europe, though there is no reason why it should not be about Byzantium, Islam, India, China or any other mediaeval civilisation. But let us stick to Western Europe. In Western Christendom (and also in Byzantium) the universal system of time-keeping was the Julian calendar. You have asked specifically about “townspeople”. Unlike other respondents to this question, I am not convinced that the majority of the population in mediaeval European towns were illiterate. But literate or not, there is no reason to doubt that they knew what the date was according to the Julian calendar. Merchants (for example) needed to know this. But also in the countryside people needed to know the date so as to plant their crops at the correct time of year. Calendars are very much part of popular culture in all civilisations. And this has nothing to do with newspapers. 

The Liverpool Scotland constituency had a very large number of residents who had moved there from Ireland, fleeing the Great Hunger caused by potato blight. At the time, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, so they were just moving to a different part of the state. The Great Hunger became a rallying point for Irish Nationalism, accounting for the election of an Irish Nationalist Member of Parliament. Note that T. P. O'Connor was the MP for the whole of the Irish Nationalist period. Liverpool is still a notably Irish-influenced city. The "Liverpool Scotland" name comes from Scotland Road, part of a turnpike route to Scotland, which lay at the centre of the constituency. 

Carrier-based fighters could have been somewhat helpful to the USAAF's day bombing campaign over Germany before the arrival of the Mustang. They could have helped with bombing the coastal area of north-east Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. However, this would have involved the USAAF, part of the US Army, admitting that their weapons and tactics for bomber defence were faulty and the US Navy could do something that they could not do themselves. They really weren't keen on those ideas. Addendum: The Royal Air Force did send fighters along on their night bombing raids. These were twin-engine Beaufighter or Mosquito aircraft, with long range, whose purpose was to hunt and kill Luftwaffe night-fighters. They were equipped with radar and a variety of devices for detecting and homing on Luftwaffe night-fighters' radar emissions. They either flew with the bombers and hunted in their vicinity, or lurked near night-fighter bases to catch their prey at takeoff or landing. The Luftwaffe did stage "intruder" missions of this type for a while, but Hitler decided that they should defend Germany over Germany, rather than over Britain. 

I am attaching a longish quotation from the Code of Justinian, promulgated in AD 528. As you can observe, the Code makes a clear distinction between rape and adultery. It stipulates the death penalty for men guilty of rape, regardless of whether the victim is married or unmarried, or of whether she a free woman or a slave. The only difference is that if the victim is free, the rapist, besides being executed, forfeits all his property to the victim, but if she is a slave the perpetrator loses his life, but not his property (that is: his property goes to his legal heirs). 

“Europe” and “Asia” as distinct cultural units are defined by Herodotus almost at the beginning of his histories.(1.4.4: τὴν γὰρ Ἀσίην καὶ τὰ ἐνοικέοντα ἔθνεα βάρβαρα οἰκηιεῦνται οἱ Πέρσαι, τὴν δὲ Εὐρώπην καὶ τὸ Ἑλληνικόν ἥγηνται κεχωρίσθαι. ) Herodotus lived in the 5th century BC. 

There is also the fact that papyrus books were written on scrolls. You can't really write a continuous text on both sides of the scroll. 

As other have said, the change became appreciated during WWII. An important prerequisite for the change was the advent of aircraft engines in the 1000hp class, which meant that single-engine aircraft that could fit on carriers could also carry bombs and torpedoes powerful enough to be a serious danger to large warships. Such engines started to come into service in the mid-1930s, which was only about one battleship building cycle before the outbreak of WWII. It's thus easy to see why the change wasn't appreciated until ships had been sunk. 

For the British monarchy, the answer seems to be "no". Since the Act of Union in 1707, only two monarchs have married while on the throne, George III and Victoria. Both of their spouses were royal, and neither had any special title during the engagement. George III married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, in part because she had no experience of politics. The engagement was formalised on 15th August 1761, and they were married on 8th September; there would hardly have been any point in giving her a special title for three weeks. Victoria proposed to Albert on 15th October 1839, and they were married on 10th February 1840. He had no special title or style during the engagement, although he was made a Knight of the Garter in December 1839. It's not clear just when Edward VIII proposed to Wallis Simpson, but he made it officially known on 16th November 1936, and abdicated on 10th December. She was not a princess, and certainly had no title until she actually married him, when she became the Duchess of Windsor. Men who marry daughters of a British monarch sometimes receive a peerage, bestowed on them the morning before the wedding. However, they have no special title before then. Examples include Prince Phillip, who was made Duke of Edinburgh on the morning of his marriage to Princess Elizabeth, and Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was made Earl of Snowdon on the morning of his marriage to Princess Margret. Mark Phillips did not receive a peerage when he married Princess Anne; he may have declined it.
