I would classify tools into two groups. The ones you ride with, and the ones you keep at home. There may be a bunch of overlap, but it is harder to work with a multi-purpose tool, so if you end up using one tool all the time, a purpose-specific tool may be worth the purchase. Tools to carry with you: 

Have you considered trying something with a different application method? Hosing your chain down with Tri-Flow works, but there is a lot of excess to go along with that. This summer, I switched from T9 to using motor oil on my chains, and it seems to work well in all the areas you discussed. I have heard a lot of people don't like using motor oil, but it hasn't let me down yet. It keeps the chains quiet and happy on both my bikes, even in the worst of rain (puddles up to the bottom bracket). I'm in a fairly cold environment (80F to 20F) so I've been using 30 weight oil, but any weight should work. I use an oil can with a hand pump (similar to this one), which makes it easy to apply one drop per roller. After giving the drive train a good spit (keeping the chain moving for a minute or two), you can wipe any excess off the plates. This allows you to put on just enough lube, without creating a dirt trap, or having lube flinging off onto clothing. It may sound boring to oil the chain in this way, but after a few runs at it, it becomes quite relaxing. Still is takes ~5 minutes to lube it up, though. 

So I have a Surly Pugsley which I love dearly. I want to add a rack to it so that I can do simple "grocery getter" tasks on my way to and from work, but I'm afraid that standard racks will not work because of the special nature of the frame. Are there any racks out there that will work with a Pugsley? Are there any modifications that need to be made for them to work? 

Riding pretty much year round (I <3 my Pugsley) in the high mountains out AZ, I've had to come up with a few glove solutions for the different weather. I don't think I would be able to ride every day without each of the following: 

Anything beyond that, and I'd take it down to the LBS, let a trained eye take a look (and listen) to them and see what they say. 

This doesn't help with the longevity of parts, but if you are doing 100 miles per week, you may want to learn to work on the bike yourself, and invest in your own tools. Let's face it, at 100 miles per week, you'll probably be working on the bike at least a couple times a month (bearings, brake adjustments, flat repairs, etc). So why not add in the tools to do your own drive train, and lower the cost down to parts alone? For your drive train, you would need a good set of hex wrenches ($19.95), a chain breaker ($15.95), a cassette tool ($5.99), a chain whip ($21.95), and a crank puller ($13.95). After tax, this would come out to ~$78 (according to JensonUSA.com), but would give you everything except parts you need to do the work. I have a hard time imagining that this wouldn't pay for itself within the first year of regular maintenance. I would also invest in a chain cleaner, as they can increase chain life depending on your usage. 

If the bearings are sealed (so dirt can't get into the bearing), and there isn't an interface (two surfaces rubbing together), than lube is probably not needed. Adding lube may actually create a dirt-trap as more dirt sticks rather than just getting in there and falling back out. The threads, certainly. Packing in behind the lock ring? Not so much. 

Crack loose the stem Pinch Bolts. Don't take the stem off, just get it loose enough to slide around. When locked down, the stem will hold everything together, so we can't adjust anything. Tighten the stem cap bolt (labeled as "Top Cap" in the images above) by about a quarter turn each adjustment and then check the headset again. If you have over-tightened, back it off by an eighth turn and check again. Once everything is adjusted, line up the stem with the front wheel and lock back down the Pinch Bolts. Give it one more quick check (nothing should have changed, but it takes two seconds, so why not?). Best part: Test ride! See how she feels. 

Ensure the disc is mounted properly - Check to ensure that the disc is mounted to the wheels correctly. 

From my understanding (certainly no fit expert), you're probably fine as long as you're not crunching your privates on the top tube. Your leg should be close to fully extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke, so you would be on tippy-toes or less when at a complete stop. You'll also probably find that mounting requires the use of the pedal as a "step" to get on. 

Check the pads for debris - Pull the pads out and look for rocks, plastic, sticks, or anything else that might have gotten embedded in the pads. Clean the pads - Hit the pads with some sand paper to take off the top layer. Center the disk in the caliper - This one is in your install/service manual. So for Hayes Stroker Trail brakes: 

A lot of the jogging apps will work well for on the bicycle as well, since most of the data collection is done via the GPS. As for the mounts, I've seen this one used a bit and it looks fairly sturdy. Not sure about the attachment to the bars, though. I would just be careful with the kind of riding you're doing. An iPhone costs $400 to $600 dollars if you aren't signing a new contract, so if you're doing mountain biking, I would stray away from it. Anything mounted to your bars needs to be able to take a beating. If I take my iPhone on a mountain ride, I usually have it tucked way deep in my Camelbak. For my bikes, I use a simple bike computer (for mileage, time moving, etc), and an iPod Shuffle (first generation) for music. The Shuffle actually attaches to the back of my helmet quite well, keeping it and the headphones cables out of my way. 

I would also suggest you check out Pearl Izumi's website for gloves. They have a pretty wide array, and most of the ones they make in my size (quadruple-extra-jumbo) fit and work rather well. 

You may also need to re-center your disc in your caliper. I use Avid BB7's, and the owner's manual gives you the directions to re-center the disc. This is basically making it so that when the pads impact the disc, the pads on both sides pinch down on the disc. If the disc is too far off-center, only one pad will rub, which isn't really enough to stop the wheel. This may or may not apply to your brakes, but I can't imagine it not being in the instructions. 

I just picked up a Timbuk2 Handlebar Bag, and so far am loving it. Has a nice velcro-down pouch, and attached to the bike via two velcro strips. It is on the bike well enough to hold my daily lunch, u-lock, glasses and a few other things. It also has straps to turn it into a fanny-pack style bag. 

Grab the front brake with your left hand, and grab the interface between the frame and the top of the headset with the other. This is the "No Wrench Flats" in the image above. Rock the bike back and forth with the brake on. If you can feel the top of the headset moving independently from the head tube, it probably needs to be tightened. Pick the front end of the bike up by the top tube, and let the handle bars/front wheel/fork "flop" from side to side. If they flop around loosely and don't bind up, you haven't over-tightened the bearings. 

It seems as though you have a different tolerance for cold than the "average" rider. This can be caused by a lot of different things. For example, I frequently notice the difference between myself and others since most of the state is very warm (Phoenix, Tucson, etc, where 75f is coat weather), while I am acclimated in an area where 60f is a nice day. As a result, I would suggest adjusting your gear choices a bit to the colder side. While a "warmer" glove might be fine for an "average rider", you might be freezing even with a "warmest" glove choice. For example, I have a pair of Gore Bike Wear gloves (Should be the same Gore Windstopper Nylon), but have fairly thick insulation in addition. I wear these when the temperature gets below 30f, and above 10f, with no problems, but they may be perfect for you, even in your warmer weather. If even warmer gloves don't suit your needs, you might want to look at non-glove hand warmers. I have a pair of Bar Mitts which I use in conjunction with my other glove choices. At about 10f, I go to my summer gloves inside the bar mitts; 0f to my mid-level gloves; -10f back to the Bike Wear gloves. Hope something in there helps.
