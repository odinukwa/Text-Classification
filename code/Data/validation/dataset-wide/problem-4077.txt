As a late adapter to smart phones, I just recently started idling away some time playing the popular app Flow Free (Big Duck Games). The goal is to connect pairs of dots of the same color with grid paths that do not intersect and cover the entire grid. It makes me think of the Gessel-Viennot lemma about a determinant counting nonintersecting sets of paths (although there often only moves right and up are allowed). One could make a computer display where the pairs of dots have a unique set of nonintersecting paths. An initial step could lead visitors through the number of paths between two points being counted by binomial coefficients. Then finding a set of nonintersecting paths is similar to the game (same sort of touchscreen interface), with the bonus that your work shows that a particular determinant is 1 (without all the arithmetic and plus / minus signs). The same interface could have an exploration of paths strictly below the diagonal that lead to Catalan numbers, which connects to a whole host of visually engaging things such as triangulating regular polygons and making "penny piles" (Richard Stanley is up to 202 things counted by these numbers -- that could be a whole special exhibit). 

(The dotted line and $D_i$ are about changing this to a toroidal embedding.) It doesn't seem like their name for this family of graphs is widely used; I found one undergraduate thesis mention it in an aside and some possibly relevant physics research. As to further study, Möbius lattices come up in two exercises of Kocay & Kreher: (1) Show that the Möbius ladder $L_{2n-2}$ is a minor of the Möbius lattice $L_{2n+1}$ for $n \ge 3$. (2) Show that the Möbius lattice $L_{2n-1}$ has an embedding on the torus in which all faces are quadrilaterals. 

Here's the outline of an answer; I can work on details if it seems promising. The exact count of subpartitions of a given partition was given by MacMahon and can also be worked out as an application of the Gessel--Viennot lemma; see my answers to $URL$ The question then becomes which partition of $n$ has the most subpartitions. My intuition is the "most triangular" one (i.e., $(k, k-1, \dots, 2, 1)$ if $n$ is a triangular number, $(k, \dots, j+1, j-1, \dots, 1)$ if not). Then you're better at the analytics than I am, Greg. 

I think Gerry's right; this is the construction that Kocay & Kreher in Graphs, Algorithms, and Optimization call the Möbius lattice (definition 13.18 on p. 365 of the 2004 edition, definition 15.21 on p. 403 of the 2016 edition, just after Möbius ladder). Their projective embedding of $L_7$ below corresponds to your graph (with appropriate vertex labels). 

Since I can't see immediately how Hanlon uses the equation, I guess the question is which "typo" was made. Linus's equation is correct, but I also think $$ \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (\beta - i) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \beta^{c(\sigma)} $$ is true (and probably follows easily from Stanley's third proof referenced on the math.SE problem). 

Not an answer, but too long for a comment. This addresses a previous comment and points out the smallest case where the requested bijection is not obvious (for the even case). Through $n = 8$, the partition sets are in bijection via a combination of transposition and the identity map, so there is a direct correspondence for the tableaux. $Pe_{10} = \{10, 82, 64, 622, 442\}$ and $Qe_{10} = \{55, 4411, 331^4, 221^6, 1^{10}\}$. The partitions that don't match up are 64 & 442 versus 55 & 4411. Using the hook length formula, there are 90 standard Young tableaux of shape (6,4) and 252 of shape (4,4,2), so these contribute 342 to $TPe_{10}$. (Sorry for the change in partition notation, but "90 of shape 64" looked strange.) There are 42 tableaux of shape (5,5) and 300 of shape (4,4,1,1), also contributing 342 to $TQe_{10}$. So the conjecture does hold for $n=10$. This example shows that the requested bijection cannot preserve the tableaux shape/underlying partition. 

Devra Garfinkle developed such a correspondence to pairs of domino tableaux in a series of Compositio Mathematica papers in the early 1990s. (The first & third, but curiously not the second, are available through EUDML: $URL$ and $URL$ More succinct summaries are given in the work of McGovern, van Leeuwen, Shimizono, Pietraho, Taskin, etc. The $W(B_2)$ example you request doesn't involve any of the horizontal/vertical domino rotations that make this theory tricky, just a little bumping. Here are the 8 domino tableaux pairs in the order you gave the $W(B_2)$ elements. Note that all but the 5th and 6th are involutions, so their left and right tableaux are the same in all but those. [If someone knows how to TeX these into nice domino pictures, please do so and let me know how you do it.] \begin{gather*} \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \end{matrix}\right), \quad \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 \end{matrix}\right), \\ \\ \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{matrix}\right), \quad \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix}\right), \\ \\ \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{matrix}\right), \quad \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix}\right), \\ \\ \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \\ 1 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \\ 1 \end{matrix}\right), \quad \left(\begin{matrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix}, \quad \begin{matrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix}\right). \end{gather*} (The domino tableaux for $W(C_2)$ also have dominoes labeled 1 and 2, but no 0 square.) 

After playing with lots of graph families and combinations, I think I have $k(1000) \le 12$, although the verification is not as clean as user44191's bound of 13. The P-graph of the partition 187, 143, 119, 115, 95, 91, 87, 58, 57, 46, 1, 1 of 1000 consists of a 6-cycle, a 4-cycle, and 2 isolated vertices. In particular, using Gerhard's notion of labeling cycle edges, the 6-cycle edges have labels 2, 23, 5, 19, 3, 29 and the 4-cycle edges have labels 7, 13, 11, 17. Is this the only 12-part partition of 1000 with this P-graph? Well, using 31 rather than 29 as the highest edge label makes the sum of the parts from the cycles at least 1004, so we need the smallest 10 primes. I don't know a good explanation for the {{2, 3, 5, 19, 23, 29}, {7, 11, 13, 17}} split other than I had Mathematica do them all. Once the subsets are chosen, the cyclic order of the edge labels follows a pattern as in Gerhard's answer: For $a < b < c < d$, the cyclic order $a,d,b,c$ avoids the largest possible product $cd$ as a part; then $a, e, c, d, b, f$ gives a minimum sum for six labels. This leads to parts 46, 115, 95, 57, 87, 58 on the 6-cycle and 91, 143, 187, 119 on the 4-cycle, total 998. The 2 isolated vertices contribute the two 1s to give 1000. (Tinkering with the order of the edge labels in either cycle increases the sum by at least 4.) There is an assignment of the same labels to a 6-cycle and a 4-cycle that gives a sum of 994 (specifically, 5, 13, 7, 11, 17, 19 and 2, 23, 3, 29---changing the order of any of these labels increases the sum by at least 8), but no 2 parts corresponding to the isolated vertices can contribute 6 more to make a partition of 1000. Looking at just a 6- & 4-cycle with edges labeled with the first 10 primes, possible sums in increasing order start 994, 998, 1018 (each of these three happens to arise uniquely). Bernardo, I enjoyed hearing about these at G4G13 and was pleased to find several related threads here. Thanks for all these nice questions. 

My hunch was off. Looking at just triangular numbers $n$, by 15 the triangular partition is not the one with the most subpartitions: $(5,4,3,2,1)$ has 132 while $(6,3,2,2,1,1)$ has 145. For other $n$, the nearly-triangular partitions are overtaken already at 9: $(5,2,1,1)$ has 33 subpartitions while a maximal nearly-triangular partition $(4,2,2,1)$ has 32. By the way, the hunch would have been nice for triangular $n$ since the number of subpartitions of $(n, n-1, \dots, 2, 1)$ is the $n$th Catalan number. It would be interesting to characterize the partitions with the most subpartitions. It seems these "fullest" partitions are more concave, with longer initial rows / left columns in the Ferrers's diagrams. But that's getting away from Greg's original problem. 

The next case is even more interesting because the tableaux counts match even though there are not the same number of partitions in the sets. The unmatched partitions are $(8,4),(6,4,2),(4,4,4) \in Pe_{12}$ and $(5,5,1,1),(4,4,1,1,1,1) \in Qe_{12}$. And the sums work: Writing $\textrm{SYT}(\lambda)$ for the number of standard Young tableaux with shape $\lambda$, we have $$\textrm{SYT}((8,4))+\textrm{SYT}((6,4,2))+\textrm{SYT}((4,4,4))=275+2673+462=3410,$$ $$\textrm{SYT}((5,5,1,1))+\textrm{SYT}((4,4,1,1,1,1))=1485+1925=3410.$$ The next two cases work but don't offer anything new. Here are a few general comments. 

I believe a partition of 12 answers your 3rd question in the negative: Consider (6,2,2,2). Each hook length is in the set $\{1,2,3,4,8,9\}$, so it is 6-core. One can check that the partition admits total decompositions into both 2- and 3-rim hooks. No answers for your more interesting questions. Initially I thought of Jaclyn Anderson's 2002 Discrete Mathematics article "Partitions that are simultaneously $t_1$- and $t_2$-core" and the work it inspired, but your question is at the opposite extreme by asking about $t_1$- and $t_2$-decomposable partitions. 

As per User44191's suggestion, this example can be condensed into another verification that $k(1000) \le 11$. The partition of 1000 is 187, 143, 119, 115, 95, 91, 87, 58, 57, 46, 2. The P-graph is a 4-cycle and a 7-cycle with one additional edge connecting two vertices that would otherwise be two apart. The 4-cycle is the same as described above. From the earlier work, the other component is most easily described as adding to the 6-cycle a vertex labeled 2 with two edges labeled 2 connecting to the vertices for 46 and 58. From the uniqueness of the underlying 4- & 6-cycles summing to 998, any other vertex with edges would have a label greater than 2 and take the sum over 1000. 

Let $S=\lbrace s_1,\ldots,s_n \rbrace \subset \lbrace1,\ldots,2n\rbrace$. Consider two operations on $S$: the complement $C(S)=\lbrace 1,\ldots,2n \rbrace \setminus S$ and a reflection* $R(S)=\lbrace2n+1−s_1,\ldots,2n+1−s_n\rbrace$. In general, $C(S) \ne R(S)$, but the sums of their elements are equal. E.g., $S=\lbrace3,4,5\rbrace \subset \lbrace1,\ldots,6\rbrace$ has $C(S)=\lbrace1,2,6\rbrace$, sum 9, and $R(S)=\lbrace2,3,4\rbrace$, sum 9. My question is not how to prove this (it's a nice proof appropriate for a discrete math course), rather the history of this result or at least a citation. For me, this arose in looking at applications of permutations to fair division of indivisible goods. Footnote * This operation $R$ is also called the complement in Egge, Annals of Combinatorics, 2007; Marc van Leeuwen suggested calling it reflection to avoid confusion. Caveat: I recently ran this question on math.stackexchange where, despite a bonus, it generated no answers. I'm still figuring out which site is better for certain questions. 

(The coefficients in the denominator expressions are given by A054651; I don't find an OEIS entry for the analogous numerator coefficients.) 

I believe the conjecture is false. Following up on Grochow's recommendation, Mathematica computations show $$\mathcal{R}[4] = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 24 \}$$ so that \begin{align} \mathcal{R}_2[4] = \{&0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, \\&22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 42, 48 \}.\end{align} But (after some hours) \begin{align} \mathcal{R}[5] = \{&0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, \\&22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, \\&46, 48, 50, 53, 54, 60, 64, 72, 78, 96, 120\}. \end{align} In particular, $27, 35 \in \mathcal{R}_2[4]$ but neither is in $\mathcal{R}[5]$. Concerning the sufficient condition $\{0,1,2,\dots,2(n!)\} \subseteq \mathcal{R}[n+1]$, note that 27, 35, 37, 41, 43, 45, 47 are all missing from $\mathcal{R}[5]$.
