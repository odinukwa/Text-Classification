im not sure if this would be considered as a question or not. I would delete it if not counted for. But just wanted to know, where can I get Oracle 12.1.0.1 software binaries. $URL$ gives me 12.1.0.2 but what about 12.1.0.1 software? Kindly help 

Should I need to enable ? If I enable this, will I be able to take binary log backups from my passive master? If I enable it in passive master, I should not enable the same on active master right? 

Why is it that for non-real time apply from cascading to cascaded standby that we have to mention as SYNC as the redo transport mode? Ideally we mention SYNC for real time apply right? Also, should we mention as SYNC NOAFFIRM for non-real time apply? Thanks! 

What is the difference between a data guard (Oracle 11g) operating in max performance ASYNC mode and enabling real time apply and a data guard operating in maximum availability SYNC and enabling real time apply? What is the overhead on performance in both? Also, does it make sense in enabling real time apply in max performance mode? 

My Container database (CDBROOT) is showing as read-write mode and while my pluggable database is showing as mount-state. Does that mean the application is using the container database and not the pluggable? Also, is it possible to move back to the non-container database architecture? 

I have tried to reconfiguring by taking a new full backup of primary as well. Getting the same error still. How can this be resolved? I can give more info if needed. 

One of my databases in my DR is fully corrupted ( I have checked running validate database using RMAN).

At the end of each financial year, audit team asks for audit records for samples dates in a year as per their methodology and ideally we are supposed to provide them. (Say, give them list of schemas dropped in a particular month or modifications made for a schema in a month) Now, im in a situation I need to save the audit data for one complete year, is there anyway to purge the audit data on a monthly basis and at the same time provide the necessary info by the end of the year. The reason I need to purge is because of the audit file size which grows to a huge size. What choices do I have? I do not have license to Oracle Audit Vault as well. 

I have MySQL community version 5.5.50 running in linux having 4-5 databases on it. Requirement is to upgrade to Percona Server 5.6.31-77.0. What are the pre-requisites that I need to check before upgrading? Are there any common errors that i'm likely to face? I'm simply planning to backup the databases. Remove the MySQL binaries. Install the new Percona Server and restore the databases.

Is it recommended to have the MySQL database location as the default one which is /varlib/mysql ? Are there any risks in having the databases in the specified location? 

I'm about to create a RMAN catalog database for my setup, what are the general precautions or major pre-requisites as in DB parameters, compatibility,etc that I should take care while creating the catalog database? 

I have a oracle 11g (11.3) database running with two standby databases (at different locations) in Maximum performance mode. The platform is Linux. Log transport parameters are: 

I'm having a Recovery catalog database 12c version. While I'm trying to register the target database (11g) with the catalog I get the following error: 

I had my innodb file format changed from antelope to barracuda recently. Is it safe to have both antelope and barracuda at the same time? I have my setup running properly now. What issues I would face? Or should I change it back to antelope. 

I have a primary and an standby database. Because my file-system became full in standby database, the recovery has stopped in standby. This is the present state of sequences in primary and standby: 

The last_number column in all_sequences was different in both the databases (11g and 12c) ideally it should be the same. What I did was I incremented the sequnce number of 12c database higher than the sequence number as that of 11g database. And the error did not show up. All is well.! 

DB_unique_name and service name is one and the same. As per MOS, I should create the service in this format: 

Does select_catalog_role if granted to a schema provide access only to dba tables and v$ views only and not to other schemas created for any application? The reason i'm asking this is I need to grant select_catalog_role to some administrators but not to the application schemas where in sensitive information resides. 

I have 10 databases so should I take daily backup as one dump containing all the databases, if yes when restoring will I be able to restore each database from the full dump which has all the databases? Or taking one db at a time is the good way to go? Should I take backup from active master or read-only master? If read-only master is the case, then what if before the replication had broken and the backup has been taken from read-only - it will not have the updated data until the replication is active again right? So backing up from active master is fine? How to go about backing binary logs since im not aware of it much.? What is the process to take binary log backup.? 

I have created my Oracle 12c database with database character set as AL32UTF8 and I have been told by the developers that it needs to be changed to UTF8. National character set is UTF8. Is it supported and feasible conversion of character set from AL32UTF8 to UTF8? 

I have Oracle Linux running on vmware hosting an Oracle database with ASM (single instance). There isn't any operating system device persistence and therefore whenever my OS reboots, the disk number changes and ASM doesn't mount the disks even after I set diskstring parameter. I do not have OS multipathing since I have multipath on storage. Disks are configured using asmlib only. I understand asmlib was introduced to ease the management of disks (addition of disks to the cluster) but wasn't it also designed to prevent this from happening? How can I prevent on server reboots, the disk major and minor number changes and diskgroups are not getting mounted. Will add more information if required.
