Summary What you're trying to do doesn't make sense unless you send a few thousand (or more, depending on sensitivity) mapping drones into the galaxy to keep up-to-date mapping data. The drones would be connected in an FTL sneakernet so you can just ping the nearest drones for data from time to time and have pretty accurate data. Note that if you're in the thousands of probes range, the data will necessarily be predictions from light thousands of years old. The simulations should be very accurate with advanced math, but things like "the Death Star exploded your planet" won't show up. Additionally, without extremely good resolution on the drones (not likely due to diffraction limits), there will always be uncertainty about the exact positions of small bodies in the unexplored / infrequently visited solar systems. As such, you'll need to send a scout drone ahead to be absolutely certain there's nothing where you're going in you're in unexplored areas. However, mapping within explored solar systems would be done routinely so there will be no issues there. You're pretty safe blindly jumping anywhere you can see, so it's not that huge of a deal anyways1. If you want one-year "real-time" accuracy, you'll need hundreds of millions to hundreds of billions of probes. Same thing if you want to see all the planets in the system without probes jumping ahead. I didn't do any math, but the entire network could potentially be setup within days if your mapping drones can jump hundreds of light years at a time. However, it will take some time to calculate precise velocity information to make your models accurate. A few years should be fine, but an advanced civilization could probably do it faster. From there, updates every few decades should be sufficient. Can't take a snapshot from a single point. There's no way to take a snapshot of the entire galaxy from a single point in the galaxy. The galaxy itself blocks light from reaching us, plus there's a resolution limit due to diffraction. There's (probably) also the pesky super-massive black hole in the center of the galaxy that's difficult to see past. That said, you could get pretty good pictures of the galaxy by using a number of probes spread through the galaxy. There's no way you'd get exact positions of all the planets, asteroids, and smaller junk from really long distances, but you could at least know where all the major stuff is. Highly populated areas would have lots of data available for real-time updates on pretty much anything hazardous. Unexplored areas would require mapping before a jump. Need lots of probes. How many? Future technology will improve our resolution to an extent, but let's say 1000 light years is a good range to see most stuff (this page says we can use parallax out to a couple thousand, but let's be conservative). Then we just need to cover the galaxy in a 1000 light year grid. The galaxy is roughly cylindrical. From Wikipedia, it's about 100k light years in diameter, and 1k light years thick. That's a volume of about $2\pi rh$ $=2\pi(50kly)^2\cdot1kly$ $\approx6\cdot10^{13}ly^3$. In 3D space, the furthest points in a rectangular grid are $\sqrt{d^2+d^2+d^2}$ $=\sqrt{3d^2}$ $=d\sqrt{3}$. The furthest point should be in the middle of a grid cube. This means our grid needs to be $2\cdot\frac{1000ly}{\sqrt{3}}$ $\approx 1155 ly$ from node to node in order for every star to be within 1000 light years of a station. Originally, I thought of a bunch of cubic groups. Each group will have eight stations (the corners of the cube), but almost all of those stations will be shared by four or eight cubes. Each cube will be $(1155ly)^3$ $=1.54\cdot10^9ly^3$ in volume. That means we need about $\frac{6\cdot10^{13}ly^3}{1.54\cdot10^9ly^3}$ $\approx 39000$ cubes. Since each cube has eight stations, and most nodes are shared by eight cubes, that's around 39000 stations. Note, however, that this only applies if you're putting a lot of stations much closer together. It gets a little tricky here. In a 3D grid, each station will be shared by eight cubes. So there's approximately 1 station per cube, as above (technically, the outer edges will have un-shared stations, but they're in the minority). But once your view distance is over 1000-2000 ly (the thickness of the galaxy), we just have a single layer covering everything, so it's a 2D grid. In this configuration, each station is shared by about 4 cubes, so there are 2 stations per cube. 

I think antigravity would be the "simple" approach using common sci-fi devices. Hypothetically, we could have gravitons and anti-gravitons of some kind where the one cancels out the other. Then we just stream ridiculous amounts of antigravity towards the gravity, and eventually the black hole falls apart. This presumes that A) your scientists find a way to create artificial gravity, and B) that negative gravity exists. And C) that you have a bunch of stars lying around with Dyson spheres you can use to power your antigravity beams. 

In many religions, suicide is considered an unforgivable sin. Well, at least in Catholicism, but I think there are others. (It seems the Catholic church no longer teaches this, but the idea is definitely real.) Many religions teach that we're on this planet for a purpose, and committing suicide is contrary to that purpose. If there's an eternal afterlife waiting after this one, what difference will a few more decades make? Many religions talk about rewards in the afterlife being commensurate with accomplishments in this life. Who wants to be stuck in the ghetto of heaven for eternity when they could suck it up and try for the Ritz? As long as your friends and family aren't killing themselves left and right, committing suicide will cause them grief, anguish, and hardship. Putting them through this isn't very nice, is it? Just because there are hardships in life doesn't mean everyone is miserable and just waiting for a better place. Lots of people actually enjoy this life and aren't in any particular rush to leave it behind. Of course, not everyone is really sure about the whole afterlife thing, so they're less willing to take the risk. As noted in some other answers and comments, the premises of the OP don't lend to undeniable proof of anything, so the "I'm religious but don't really believe" crowd will still exist. 

Count the Days. The easiest counting method is alien days. You've got a giant alien clock right under your feet. Just tick off how many days have passed, apply a conversion factor, and voila! You could also use a readily-identifiable constellation, a moon, whatever. (Technically, distant stars are best, because highly-eccentric orbits don't affect that measurement.) Use a Sundial. But you need to correlate alien days to Earth days. It's unlikely you can maintain any particular counting method for the entire day (moreso to do so without errors), so you'll want a shorter interval. A sundial will give you a good way to track time in hour-ish increments, and possibly as good as minute-ish increments. Sundials are extremely easy to implement, so that's good. Use one of the Earth-time methods below to see how long 5 alien minutes, or one alien hour, etc. are. The bad part of a sundial is that the ratio (probably) changes from day to day, so you'll have to take that into account. It's best if you can get the timing of an entire day/night cycle, so you'll want a "stardial" of some type. Using a raised, flat rock with sand on top, you can put a pointy rock near the edge, then sight along it from below and beside the flat rock. Put a mark in the sand directly between your eye and the rock, while "aiming" the end of the rock at some notable star as it comes off the horizon, then another mark every so often (every thousand heartbeats, or every tenth time you finish Mary Had a Little Lamb, whatever). Make another mark when the star goes behind the horizon. By comparing the arc length of several smaller intervals to the arc length of the full night, you can estimate the length of the night. Unfortunately, neither of these is going to be terribly accurate. You either need to build a really big sun/stardial (this is possible, and probably a good idea), or make very precise, very tiny marks each time. Otherwise each mark will span minutes, perhaps tens of minutes. Build a Pendulum. A really nice way to tell shorter time periods is some type of periodic motion. Like a pendulum. Unfortunately, keeping the pendulum swinging is a rather large feat of engineering unless you want to push it manually, in which case you'll introduce more error. Still, this is probably a pretty decent approximation given your options. But you need to make sure to use a thin, light string of some sort, or get some really slick goop to "oil" the contact if you slide, e.g., a stick onto another stick with a hole. Otherwise the stiffness or friction is going to introduce errors that will be hard to account for later. For most people, the pendulum will be adequate for measuring time over several hours to more accurately calibrate the day, but it's unlikely many people could construct an actual clock any time soon. A Water Clock. This requires you to be capable of moving water in sufficient quantities to fill at least one bucket, and preferably several, and is a pretty decent way to estimate the length of a day. You wouldn't want to keep it running constantly, but you don't really need to so that's fine. Find a Local Clock. It's possible there is an existing civilization who has existing clocks. This makes your job trivial, but isn't remotely guaranteed. Plus, they aren't guaranteed to be friendly if they do exist.
