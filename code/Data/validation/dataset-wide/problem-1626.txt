What is the difference between a burr and blade coffee grinders? There is also the claim that using a blade grinder, with the blades whirring at high speeds, coming into contact with the beans and grinds, causes heat from the friction of contact, altering the flavor. Not sure how true that claim is, though. How to Grind Coffee - Learn About Coffee Grinding Do different levels of grinds lead to different tasting coffee? 

Not likely. Experts commenting on the high rate of parasitic worms found in the general population attribute it to people desperately poor and hungry enough that they don't go through extensive processes to safeguard human waste/manure when used as fertilizers for crops. Those higher up the proverbial food chain don't run into these problems because foreign aid and properly produced and handled foodstuffs are aggregated to the highest levels of the political hierarchy, like with most totalitarian societies. 

The mechanism behind the "eating slower" claim is because of hunger. Whether one is hungry or satiated/full is communicated through the endocrine system, not directly through signals in the nervous system. There is a lag time between when the body hormonally signals the stomach is "full" and when that message reaches the brain. In that intervening lag, your brain still feels that you are hungry and you will continue to eat. If you eat fast, the gap between how full your stomach is and how full your brain thinks the stomach is will be greater. Slowing down allows the hormonal messages sent to the brain to be closer to the real-time, actual situation. You will feel "full" more accurately, and will not continue to have the urge to keep eating. So, yes, it is true that eating slower will lead to eating less or not over-eating, which obviously impacts weight gain or loss. 

A short history of the national anthem, protests and the NFL | PolitiFact Snopes FACT CHECK: Why Are NFL Players on the Sidelines for the National Anthem So, what is clear is that there is no requirement, now, for players to stand and recognize the anthem. Where the players are is more a matter of where they need to be in order to participate in games from the start. 

I guess it depends on what one calls "gained". I think Trump is conflating an overall long-term economic impact with the funds released by the Obama administration soon after the deal was struck. I'd further speculate that the conflation is intentional, and that, if you get into a discussion with Obama critics, they will cite that number, not the $400 million we transferred, as what Obama handed over. So, no, we didn't infuse them with a sudden injection of 150 billion. DavePhD's answer is pretty thorough, I don't have any improvements on that. In regards to that $400 million, specifically, in case that's part of what is being asked about - It was Iran's money to begin with The assets came from a fighter jet purchase that Iran paid for in the waning days of the Shah's reign. He paid for a consignment of military jets, and then was out of office before delivery could be made. The nation of Iran, regardless of how we feel about them politically, paid for a purchase of goods. The United States was legally obligated to deliver the goods, or to refund the money. Given our bellicose and hostile relationship with the new ruling parties, we thought it would be a bad idea to hand them state of the art air force fighter jets, so we cancelled the sale. However, because of ongoing disputes, we froze their assets until matters could be resolved. Since Iran was owed the money, once they agreed to stipulations in the agreement, we no longer had any legal recourse for holding the funds The United States can't arbitrarily hold the property of others on a whim. We had what we felt were legitimate disputes, but since Iran diluted their enriched uranium stockpiles, shut down their enrichment centrifuges and agreed to unprecedented levels of monitoring we no longer had a legal basis for holding the funds. Iran had the matter pending in the international courts Since we held their funds for over 45 years, obviously the main bone on contention would be how much interest was owed on assets we held. We were, potentially, on the hook for a lot more if Iran would have prevailed in a court case. The amount we agreed to transfer to them was somewhere in between the amount originally held and the amount they sought in their filings. This was not something new or unique There was a special arbitration panel for Iran-US financial disputes that has been grinding away for four decades. A lot of funds flowed from Iran to the US as legal settlements, and quite a bit the other way, as well. I don't hear anyone complaining about the greater sums of money that Iran has paid to US interests as settlements for disputes, so the idea that there are financial settlements and transactions between the nations can't logically be the issue at hand. This has been going on for decades. I have a pretty clear speculation why it is such a huge deal now, but that's opinion. $400 Million: Why the US Owed Iran In The First Place (Time Magazine) 

Smithsonian Magazine: Do You Want To Build a Snowman? Physics Can Help As far as the actual phenomenon of snowballs rolling down a hill, there are probably too many variables in terms of weight, pitch of the hill, initial velicity, moisture content, etc for me to properly find comprehensive analysis that in the space permitted, but most probably the answer is "yes, under the right conditions" for that, as well.

Nature (2006): Ethics - Increasing accountability; peer review debate The actual post-publication process is the part that really is "peer review" - this is where methods, data and conclusions are rigorously examined and tested and conclusions about the validity of the papers is really done. No scientific finding is considered valid or accepted until other scientists have examined, critiqued and attempted to replicate results, using the same methods as the original experiments/studies, or different methods. 

Clinton was assigned by the judge to defend after the indigent defendant stated the wish for a female defense attorney. Clinton was recommended by the prosecutor, and then tried to beg off the case, which was not allowed. Since she was the defense attorney, it was her job to question evidence and mount a vigorous defense. Acting as if she did something wrong in getting evidence excluded is completely backwards. It would have been immoral and unethical for her NOT to get evidence excluded if there was an issue with it. The police/forensics laboratory accidentally destroyed the DNA evidence that linked the defendant to the case. Clinton didn't have it "excluded," it no longer existed. What court in the free world would allow evidence that had been destroyed to be included in a criminal trial?

"Proven to be a liar?" - yes, this is accurate, since he pled guilty to lying to the FBI. What was he guilty of lying about? The claim that they did not try to collude with the Russians as part of the Trump campaign. So, that fact actually undermines Trump's attempted minimizing/deflection. To sum up the highlighted Tweet portion - Was known only to a few? No, false. Was he a low-level volunteer? Yes, volunteer, but no, not "low level." He had direct access to the president and was part of a small, trusted and important advisory team, and was included in high level meetings as a principle participant. Is he a proven liar? Yes, but the statements he has been proven to have lied about are the same statements that Trump and his administration are making about the allegations of collusion with hostile foreign entities. 

On This Day: Al Capone Convicted of Income Tax Evasion It's also a way for law enforcement to "put the screws" to those they deem criminals, since they are usually able to confiscate assets deemed to be from illegal activities, again, even if those illegal activity charges, themselves, don't bear fruit in the form of convictions. Getting a conviction on a charge like this, or even getting an indictment makes it easier for them to fight attempts to reclaim assets. The courts have been pretty open to the idea of "we didn't convict them, but we don't think they can legitimately account for this money, so we're taking it away."

Generally, yes, but that's not necessarily an argument for overbooking as aggressively as they do (the context in which the claim was made). They don't make a huge amount of profit per customer, as per the numbers in A Bailey's answer. By the same token, since they move such a large volume of customers, they don't incur huge per customer costs, either. So, the argument that they must overbook because they don't make a large amount of profit per customer is offset by the fact that reducing the overbooking, slightly, would also mean they're only losing a small amount of profit per customer, as well. You can't claim one and ignore the other. Airlines are hugely profitable. 2016 was a record year for them, as a whole ($35.6 B in profits), and 2015 was a record before that ($25.6 B in profits).
