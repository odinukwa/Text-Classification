Out of the list of images in the question, some can be found on this site, which provides some descriptions of the photos. One of these is identified as the 'Golden Gate' of (then) Constantinople. The Wikipedia entry says this about the Golden Gate: 

So grounded at 11:30 AM, efforts to free her until 4:30 PM, The Philadelphia was grounded for at least 5 hours. Since the only untried procedures to free the ship involved towing (and the Philadelphia was alone, as the Vixen had been sent elsewhere), and the placement of an anchor by boat some distance away to pull the ship clear in a process known as kedging. The court asked if this process had been considered on several occasions, and the response was that the ship had no boat which could carry the anchor safely, and that the enemy held the position necessary to place the anchor. So while the enemy ships were present, the Philadelphia was out of options. The Wikipedia article on Bainbridge says this, (with a source listed as The Pirate Coast, Richard Zachs): 

So we can not eliminate the strong European influence this uniform shows. The Highlander Unifom of the 79th New York state militia, for instance is very similar to the uniform being investigated, (except the kilt and jacket button pattern, and the kilt was a parade uniform item). 

Both these statements confirm the presence of Turkish mercenaries fighting for Damascus. The Crescent symbol has been associated with the Turks: 

I can give you one more name for your list. The king defeated by the Turco-Sassanian alliance was Khushnavaz. Probably. The Timeline seems disputed however. Reading details on the Sassinid leader at the time, Khosrow I led to this passage: 

I could not find any direct information on the ship, but did find another image of what appears to be the same ship, present on another web page describing operations of the Near East Foundation group in 1922, this time at the fire at Smyrna. After linking the ship to the Near East Relief efforts, reading some of the early accounts of the events of the time led to this passage from The Interior, Volume 53, dated November 30 1922: 

Concerning new construction, again the primary goal was integrating fallout shelter capabilities into applicable regular construction projects. To this end, 

It's possible we adopted the term Kamikaze because that's what we heard from the Japanese themselves. The term was apparently used by Tokyo Rose on her broadcasts to the American troops. The book Lucky Lady: The World War II Heroics of the USS Santa Fe and Franklin,By Steve Jackson, states she declared the Japanese had a new 

(There is some other good info on the above site as well concerning things such as the value of bread and other wage figures.) Getting rid of my old attempt at comparing apples and oranges, or trying to translate values to todays' dollars or pounds, we have two numbers £400,000 to £2. Therefor, if we take the 19th century figures at face value, we can conclude that: - William the Conqueror made 200,000 times the wage of a day laborer. Not quite the equivalent of Gates 33 million per day, but not inconsequential. It was definitely, as Mel Brooks would say,"Good to be King". 

So there were at least three times the number of marriages as births attributed to American servicemen. 

The book, discusses the engagement, and details the casualties on pg 167 from a report by the confederate commander: 

and goes on to state that this doesn't include individuals who returned when pardons were offered, so the initial count would have been higher. So, somewhere between 8000-9000 desertions from the British and Hessian forces facing the Continental Army occurred. 

The above article has a lot of other information you may find interesting, such as the meaning of many of the markings you show. The 66 might indicate this weapon was part of the German 66th Infantry regiment in WW1. I'm not sure what the AE unit designation might represent yet. @LangLangC found a similar item on Ebay. 

Johnson is of the opinion that breakfast was eaten, but it was definitely not 'the most important meal of the day' for the later Romans: 

Going over some lists of mountain ranges finds several named after animals: Owl Mountains, Musk Ox Mountains, Big Salmon Range, Camelsfoot Range, Cariboo Mountains, Elk River Mountains, Goat Range, Bear River Mountains, Beartooth Mountains,Beaverhead Mountains, ect. Its a long list, with many entries in the US and Canada. A couple that struck me as notable referenced camels, not native to North America, so those turned up to have at least some historical reference. Camelsfoot Range. Found in British Columbia, the story here is from Wikipedia: 

If this is the same, that means this coin depicts Constantine II, and dates to the 3rd century, Roman Empire. 

The original story, written and published in 1837, was from Bonneville's notes and maps concerning his Expedition of 1832. Concerning the second part of your question, From a web page concerning western history:Traders, Trappers, and Mountain Men 

Concerning the laborers wage: Another quick search for wages at that time gives us a site, The History of England which says: 

We can also learn a little more concerning the avisos because a couple of them have been found off the coast of Florida: 

Surprisingly, maybe. My initial thought was that a telescope would be much too valuable as a trade item. Some research did come up with an item that was shown in an antique catalog, listed as: 

It appears there were 'professional' slave hunters during Roman times, who were paid to hunt down and return fugative slaves. From Johnston's The Private Life of Romans: 

So we can associate directly the visit to Ravenna with the start of the construction project. No trip to Constantinople involved.The Basilica of San Vitale is also of Byzantine styling(emphasis mine): 

The stockade walls ,as we see them today, were not yet built. The material for their construction is laying on the ground in front of the church. From FortRoss.Org 

This leads us to the more specific query implied in the body of the question, essentially : Were there blue-eyed Cherokee Native Americans descended from Vikings? One problem with this is that technically we don't even seem to know what Cherokee DNA looks like to start wth. From a genealogy site, AccessGenealogy: 

So there are rules that must be followed by a hospital ship to be under protection. To play devil's advocate (and not my personal opinion, so don't yell at me) if the Paris could be considered ,acting at that moment, not in its role as a hospital ship, but as a military troop transport, then it would no longer be under protection... 

So I believe the ship in question may have been the Marta, according to the records concerning the relief operations at the time. Unfortunately I haven't any more info on the Marta, yet. 

Well, this appears to predate most of the 80's thoughts. The 60's versions of this quote give us a location at least, that she gave this quote while watching a demonstration of either an 'electronic computer', or an 'electronic data processing machine'. The oldest report I find is 1958: 

It seems the best argument for the suicidal aspect of his death is presented by this report from The Telegraph:Revealed: how Stalin's brutal massacre at Katyn shamed his PoW son into suicide. Some of the same elements are involved such as the electric fence, and the disputes with British officers. But the main gist of this article is the suicide aspect of the 'attempted escape', and its speculation over the cause: 

The estimates of Roman population, and the areas covered are difficult to pin down. One of the best sources I have looked at is The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Rome By Paul Erdkamp. He explains a lot of the difficulty in nailing this figure down. This book, in pages 32-35 goes into details on the area covered-and the discrepancy between the area contained by the Aurelian Walls and the areas defined as Rome by Augustus in his 14 regions, and discusses population densities derived from possible building types, areas, and occupancy. Estimates can be derived from the number of domus(1790) and insulae(46,500) that were recorded as existing in Rome by the Regionary Catalogues, and again estimating the number of people occupying each. Depending on how many occupants each building had, and the area each insulae covered, you can get population densities anywhere from 10,000 to 70,000 people per square km, giving possible populations anywhere from 230,000 to the often quoted 1 Million. 

Lets not forget the Satchel Charge. This often required the person using it to put themselves in harms way. 

Volley firing is a procedure. It involves multiple lines of troops, firing and reloading in succession. While one line fires, the other is reloading, preparing to deliver the next volley. This organization allows a commander to control the actions of his troops, and keep them ordered and calm. Military action is about discipline, not 'each guy does what he wants, when he wants'. The volley also creates a more drastic result on opponents. This case was about a cavalry charge, and a single shot might have toppled a horse, but a volley could bring down many, disturbing the charge itself. Which apparently happened in this case:
