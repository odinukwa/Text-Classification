I'd suggest silk slippers, like ballet shoes. In light colours they'd be quickly ruined and need to be replaced if ever worn outdoors. They wouldn't take much wearing even at the best of times and of course they'd be intricately embroidered to increase the cost as much as for fashion. It should be noted that due to the way fashion works, anyone wanting to spend time at court would also have to have these shoes and change them as often as the royals did themselves. Shoes of this type would apply more to the early modern period, but I'm sure the principle could be adapted to an earlier role. 

Culturally, very little would change. It was already believed that the touch of a king could cure disease. That this was actually true rather than a convenient myth might prolong the reign of kings in the more revolutionary countries as it would be considered evidence of the divine right of kings to rule. You've already limited magic to not be used on children, and the oft quoted statistics about average age at death is primarily about surviving childhood, not the actual age at which people died. 

I've seen systems like this a few times. One was based in Scotland, it was a list of candidates with STV and an option to vote for and against. A candidate would need to have a positive on the for/against to get through to the STV round to actually be elected. It's also normal on company AGMs to vote for/against election of directors, though they normally elect all candidates. 

This is a matter of perception bias from an outside observer. While it appears to us that wearing red causes people to die, it's quite the opposite that's true. The Conjoined Alliance of Space Travellers undertakes comprehensive aptitude testing of all incoming crew members. From the results of this testing people who are likely to walk across uncleared minefields, or enter rooms full of hostiles without checking, are issued red uniforms. This alerts team members around them to take better care and provide support in an to attempt to keep them alive as long as possible. 

The Keen Steamliner #2 Wait a minute! That looks like an ordinary car! Well yes, it might as well be, it's just steam powered. It's a very late example and it's an oil burner. The simple fact that the external combustion aspect of steam engines can burn any fuel of your choice makes any arguments about energy density of fuel invalid. You can heat the boiler with just about anything. This is the first of your steam advantages, hang on to it. Heat the boiler? Yes, this is a problem. It's one of the two killers of the steam engine for domestic use, depending on the size of the boiler it can take considerable time to get the water hot enough for the vehicle to run. It's a killer for the morning commute. The other was the fact that while steam cars were competitive you still needed to stop regularly to top up the water as they were open cycle. Closing the cycle is possible but significantly increases the weight you need to carry. The other great advantage to steam power is that you get full torque from a standing start. None of that revving the engine rubbish, it's full torque all the way. This kept steam power competitive until after WWII for industrial use. 

Consecutively A few hundred million years is meaningless in an eternal afterlife. You're going to be there a long time, you might as well get used to the slower pace of (non)existence while standing in the queue waiting to get in. When compared to eternity, any finite amount of time ceases to have meaning. 

That's exactly what did happen. The first hand held firearms appeared in the mid 14th century, the first professional standing army (in England) didn't appear for another 300 years. Firearms were expensive and inaccurate. When the first muzzle loading rifled firearms were introduced they were extremely expensive and only issued to the very best marksmen. You're pushing it a couple of hundred years earlier than it was, but the effect is going to be much the same. 

Consider a basic spell for a sword. Runes of Enduring Sharpness. These have to be engraved on the blade, there's no point having them anywhere else, you don't want a sharp hilt or a sharp scabbard, you want a sharp blade. The same would be true for any blade effect, firey, icy or whatever you so choose. You could consider manufactured spells for ordinary people the same way. Your big thug of a hero wants to be able to throw fireballs. He's not overly bright, nor is he able to pull out a scroll and read it in the middle of a fight (reading is not his strong point anyway). Inscribe the runes on his blade and tell him to point the sword where he wants the fireball to go and to say the magic word. The runes are both the source and the controller for the fireball which then comes out of his sword. 

Stories about characters that are OP can be a bit boring. It's all about limitations and working their way round them, with no limitations, what's the story. Death is the ultimate reality, everybody dies, but Fate decides when they die. What this means is that while Death has a job to do, making sure people die when they're supposed to, Fate gets to have all the fun. Fate decides which farmboy gets to be the hero, get the girl (or boy), slay the dragon, save the princess, and win half the kingdom. Death simply follows along behind and cleans up the mess. To say who is more powerful in the way you're asking. Death is a worker, but Fate is the boss. 

Tool use certainly, corvids are particularly good at this. Whether they could get further technological advancement is questionable, from there on it's dependent on control of fire which is hard without a prehensile limb. You're limited to "found items", or found items with minor modification. 

History of the Longbow The English Archery Law of the 13th century ensured that English men would be come experts with the bow and arrow. In 1252 the ‘Assize of Arms’ ensured that all Englishmen were ordered, by law, that every man between the age of 15 to 60 years old should equip themselves with a bow and arrows. The Plantagenet King Edward III took this further and decreed the Archery Law in 1363 which commanded the obligatory practice of archery on Sundays and holidays! The Archery Law “forbade, on pain of death, all sport that took up time better spent on war training especially archery practise”. King Henry I later proclaimed that an archer would be absolved of murder, if he killed a man during archery practise! The victories over the French at Crecy, Agincourt and Poitiers were directly due to the expertise of English archers and the longbow. Skill in the use of the longbow took considerable time. The English invested in the time required – the French did not. Up to this point the skills and weapons used by a Knight were deemed to be worth 10 ordinary soldiers – hence the French reaction to defeats by the common peasant. 

A society in which everything is easily available behind the bottleneck. Almost post scarcity but not quite. The entire economy of the planet is based around the skills of one specific group of people and their rate of production. Therefore also how many people they train up with the skills to create the special device. Greater numbers in training will reduce the immediate rate of production in favour of a higher future rate of production and improved future economy, but I'm assuming there's a base rate you can't risk falling below, so you can't all out stop production in favour of training. The Government The people who control the bottleneck control society, you're going to end up with either a technocracy directly controlled by these people, an oligarchy because they're the gateway to wealth or communism with the constructors being the first among equals. (All animals are equal but some are more equal than others) Ultimately all these come to the same thing, the power will be held by those who control the bottleneck. The difference is in what they choose to do with it. Even in the best of all possible worlds, they're unlikely to happily sit there being the only people on the planet who do any work without a significant increase in status. The Economy The economy is a mess, there's only one item that has any value and that has all the value. It's apparently critical to continued life on the planet and it's a consumable of highly limited supply. It's a basket case economy. Totally unable to operate in anything resembling a normal manner. The Currency The currency is either worthless or backed by poké balls, it's the only thing that has a non-imaginary value. Post scarcity makes a mockery of capitalism which is driven by the balance of supply and demand. There's a single item in limited supply and everything else is dependent on that one item. Either that's your currency or that's the basis of your currency. Ways to recover the economy Capitalist option: Industrialise the process. Set up supply chains for the parts and materials required. Allow some of the value of the devices to be spread among more people on the supply chain. Eventually this is likely to lead to higher production rates and a reduction in the bottleneck reducing the value of the devices and the relative power of the people who can build them. Socialist option: Communitise* the process. Each village has a master constructor and apprentices. A few times a year the whole village turns out to gather the materials required, journeyman constructors come in from the surrounding area to help with the construction. It's an all in process controlled by your master craftsman but everyone in the village has an investment in it and everyone benefits. *It's a word because I say it is, that's how you get new words. 

Use a lighter cloth. The reason we use such heavy cloth on Earth is so it has some longevity in high winds and rain. That's not a problem on Mars so you could use much lighter weight materials. You're usually looking at materials that are 85-160gsm to make a flag. You probably want something around 10-20gsm, equivalent to tissue paper, which appears to be within standard cloth manufacture ranges. This would be shredded by normal winds on Earth, but should be about right for Mars. 

L3 is on the wrong side of the Sun so we'll write that off. L4 and L5 are 60 degrees ahead and behind the planet respectively and they are stable but put you too far away to be useful, they also have a downside in that they're often occupied by trojans. L1, L2 are closer, but unstable, L2 being more stable than L1. This breaks the "near Earth" requirement, but is apparently what you're looking for. As a side note, NASA advises L5 for long term habitation 

You have underestimated the meaning of everything Someone is always being born, someone is always dying, someone is probably always taking a bribe, someone is always getting laid. There are always more interesting things going on than monitoring some minor official for corruption, there's your own life going on to start with. However the simplest way of having corruption is for it to be acceptable to the ordinary populace. They think it's an acceptable normal way of doing business, just as they consider a certain level of petty criminality to be perfectly acceptable day to day. 

By doing it every couple of years in some totally innocent way. Some years you spend sailing in the Southern Ocean, some years you spend 6 months skiing in the Alps or solo trekking across the Australian outback. Eventually they get used to your disappearing for months at a time and it taking them slightly longer than they'd like to work out where you are this time, by which point it's already too late. 

VTOL, helicopters can do this, but helicopters are expensive, complicated and need a lot of maintenance. Staying airbourne for long periods, this one is a real winner for airships. The Goodyear blimp being the best known example. Flying slowly, again helicopters can do this, expensively, noisily and uncomfortably, but there is often a need for aircraft to move slowly and airships are a good fit for that role.
