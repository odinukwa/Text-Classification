It is not really possible to lose points that you have earned in a table tennis match. If you foul during a serve, then you don't earn the point that you would have gotten if the serve had been an ace, and your opponent gets a point. Sometimes you might hear this referred to as a point deduction, but it's not really a point deduction, since the server never really earned the point. In the ITTF rankings, you earn points for wins, and lose points for losses. But these are ratings points, not points during a table tennis match. 

The receiver needs to gain control of the ball. The receiver needs to have both feet or any other body part (except hands) on the ground inbounds. The receiver needs to maintain control of the ball long enough to make a "football move." 

Engineering problems: Sochi is in a narrow region between the Black Sea and the Caucasus Mountains. There isn't a lot of room for large arenas and venues. The best place to locate the Olympic venues is the Imereti Valley, an area that is prone to flooding. The area constructed around Olympic Park has had to be built and rebuilt a few times due to flooding and inadequate engineering. Also, in constructing the new railway between the Olympic Park and the Mountain venues, major tunneling was required. Needed infrastructure: The Imereti Valley had very little infrastructure to begin with, and Russia has had to build roads, railroads, and utilities from scratch. Corruption: The first two reasons are practical reasons for excessive costs, but the majority of the article gives example after example of corruption, both by government officials and by contractors. According to the author, this is a very significant reason for the out-of-control spending. 

The World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) is probably the most geographically widespread of the tournament organizations. The Association is made up of 6 regional confederations around the world. (The Billiard Congress of America (BCA) is one of these 6 confederations.) The WPA is a member of the World Confederation of Billiard Sports, which is representing cue sports to the International Olympic Committee in an attempt at inclusion in the Olympics. The WPA publishes World Rules of Play for various games, including 8-Ball. The American Poolplayers Association (APA) claims to be the world's largest pool league, in terms of number of members. In addition to the United States, they have affiliates in Canada and Japan. They publish an 8-Ball & 9-Ball Game Rules Booklet (pdf), which is available for free online. The Valley National 8-Ball League Association (VNEA) is another large, international league with their own rules for 8-Ball. 

The difference between an "incompletion" and a "completion followed by a fumble" is in the rules for a completion. A completion has to meet three criteria: 

Unless the player is injured, the player could physically get up on their own; if they couldn't, there is no way they would be in physical shape enough to play the game. Nearly every play in football, however, ends with someone laying down on the field. At the end of the play, the players still standing typically offer a hand to help the ones that are down, even if they are on the other team. The reasons other players will lend a hand to help other players up are professionalism, courtesy, sportsmanship (for the players on the other team), and teamwork (for the players on his own team). When a player helps someone up that they have just tackled, it is acknowledgement that they are both professionals doing a job, and that there are no hard feelings. Most professional players understand that, although they play on different teams, they are all coworkers, in a sense, and that your opponent this year might be your teammate next year. That having been said, sometimes, especially in basketball, there is something else going on. Again, as with football, if a basketball player truly cannot get up off the floor on their own, they are not well enough to continue to play the game. Unfortunately, you sometimes see an element of theatrics in basketball. The player is trying to show that they have been fouled, and so they act hurt. They'll wave for help to try to draw sympathy, and then they will slam dunk the next ball they get. Basketball doesn't seem to have the "iron-man," "shake-it-off," "tough guy" culture that football has. 

I've heard the term "press high" repeatedly while watching the World Cup. What does it mean? Do teams that press high generally enjoy more possession or less? 

I sometimes hear about NFL GMs being "cap experts" rather than player-evaluators. And I just saw this headline: "John Idzik joining Jags as consultant". The article goes on to say, "Idzik, who was fired by the Jets in late December, will not have a role in player evaluation but will work with the team's salary-cap department, the source said" (emphasis mine). Sure the salary cap rules aren't simple, but how do they justify an entire department? 

When watching soccer on TV I often hear the commentators say stuff like, "They've come out in a 3-5-2, not their usual 4-4-2 in the hopes of ..." or "they've got so-and-so acting as 'false 9' today." How could I recognize these strategies myself? 

There have been several papers published on this topic, which don't always agree. Check out Ten Do It Better, Do They? which concludes that "that the impact of a red card depends on the minute of the expulsion and does not have an impact at all if given at the end of the first half or later" though red cards do increase the number of goals scored. Estimating the Effect of the Red Card in Soccer says, 

Michael Jordan's flu game is one of his most famous performances as a basketball player. Yet I remember that at the time there was some question about how sick he really was: had he been acting some to mislead his opponents? Has any information come out since that gives further indication of how ill or well he really was? 

Based on this year's schedule it seems that an NFL team's bye can come anywhere from the 4th week of the season to the 12th. Is there either conventional wisdom or statistical study of which weeks are most advantageous? I would think that a week 4 bye would be a bad deal: few players are going to be so banged up at that point that the week of makes a big different for them. 

It was once not unheard for pitchers to pitch both games of a doubleheader, even to throw back-to-back complete games: 

A "snake" draft is a draft in which the team with the first overall pick gets the last pick of the second round, then goes first in the third round and last in the fourth, etc. It narrows the advantage of going first since you get that advantage in only half of rounds and receiving a partially-offsetting disadvantage in the even numbered-rounds. It is common in fantasy sports and seems to work well there, although most fantasy leagues start the season with everyone on equal footing in personnel terms (everyone has zero players) unlike in real professional sports where teams that did well in the previous season will likely have stronger rosters than those that did poorly. 

Even if the word Barcelona should be León, I still can't think of what sort of translation error would lead to a Catalan name for a Mexican stadium. For posterity, here's the Spanish text I made my translation from: 

The answer to why all the U.S. professional teams are named this way (Location Nickname) today is because it is tradition. Baseball teams were named this way, and football, basketball, hockey, and soccer (in the U.S.) all came after baseball. Baseball teams weren't always named this way, however. The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players was the first professional baseball league (1871-1875). A few teams in this league had modern sounding names (Boston Red Stockings, Chicago White Stockings), but many teams in this league had official names like Mutual Baseball Club of New York, Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia, Union Base Ball Club Lansingburgh, Lord Baltimore Club, etc. Box scores in the newspaper would shorten these club names to one word, based on either their city or their club name: Boston, Chicago, Mutual, Athletic, Troy, Lord Baltimore, etc. The sportswriters would give the teams their own nicknames, usually based on the colors of their uniforms or the name of their field. For example, the Union Base Ball Club Lansingburgh played at Haymakers' Grounds in Troy, NY. As a result, their team was often called the Haymakers or the Trojans. Lord Baltimore got the nicknames Canaries and Yellow Stockings, because of the uniforms. Modern sportswriters, in writing about the history of these old teams, have retroactively assigned modern style names to some of these teams: they are now referred to with names New York Mutuals, Philadelphia Athletics, Troy Haymakers, and Baltimore Canaries. In 1876, six clubs from the National Association broke off and started the current National League, including two teams with old style names: Mutual and Athletic. Those two teams lasted only one season, and all that was left in this baseball league were teams with the modern name format. There are several advantages of the Location Nickname format. When reading or hearing about the team, you immediately know where the team is located. It allows for there to be more than one team in a single city or more than one team with the same nickname, yet have unique names for each. It also is an attempt to build a fanbase; having your city name (or region name) in your team name is supposed to signify that you are the official team of your city, and everyone who lives there should be a fan. 

Basically, this means that you cannot pin (stop) the ball at your five-man rod, then pass it to your three-man rod. To get around this, if you have the ball stopped on your five-rod, you can either pass the ball back to your defense, or you can bounce the ball off the wall before advancing it. However, you can't keep bouncing the ball off the wall over and over. Rule 23.2 covers this: 

What are the differences between these different events? I know that the number and spacing of the gates are different. Is that all it is, or is there more to it than that? 

If the referee is standing out of bounds, then the ball is out of bounds and dead as soon as it hits the referee. It is out on the last player to touch the ball. From NCAA Men's Basketball 2013-14 and 2014-15 Rules, Rule 7 (Out of Bounds and the Throw-in), Section 1 (Out of Bounds - Player, Ball): 

I had always assumed this was because pitchers in the old days didn't throw all the fancy pitches they do today. But the New York Times indicates otherwise: 

It's impossible for all the teams in a division to have losing records in their divisional games--every time someone loses a game, someone else in the division wins it. But the home team could win every game, and everyone would be 3-3 in divisional play. But as far as I can tell there's no reason why the teams in this unhappy division couldn't lose all ten of their other games. Is this true--is it mathematically possible for a three win team to go to the playoffs? Naturally, this question is motivated by the fact that there's serious talk of a six win team representing the NFC South. 

On Nov. 4, 2017 Iowa ran a trick play in their upset of Ohio State in which their long snapper hiked the ball to the punter before running down the field and catching a pass. The long snapper was effectively the center on the play. Why was he allowed to catch the ball? 

What's the relationship between the Kentucky Derby and the Royal Ascot horse races? The Dubai World Cup? Although some horses do, over the course of their careers, compete in all three, it seems rare compared to competing for the US triple crown. Is one event higher priority (perhaps more prestigious) for owners than the other two? Does one breed a different type of horse for the Derby than the Ascot (say, due to different surfaces)? 

Down to Ten: Estimating the Effect of a Red Card in Soccer finds an effect even for cards in the second half. Being down to nine men is much rarer and probably has not been studied carefully, for lack of data if nothing else. You also ask, "Are there ever any scenarios when playing down a man can actually improve a team's odds of winning?" I don't know of any evidence of this, but "Ten Do It Better" does note that "an old football myth suggests that...an expulsion might also be beneficial since it increases the team spirit as well as the efforts of the affected team." 

EDIT: I think @Ben is right. Suárez is trying to slide on his knees and failing. Momentum keeps his upper body moving forward even when his lower body has ground to a halt. His mouth is probably open because he's yelling (happily). 

Soccer (or "football", if you prefer) generally does not get a large television audience in the United States. However, the World Cup may be an exception (it certainly is among the people I talk to). Plus, the U.S.'s has a large population and, more importantly, the world's highest GDP. Presumably the value of advertisements is roughly proportional to the population, holding other factors constant. Lastly, with the Cup being in Brazil this year the games are on at a reasonable time for most Americans. 

In American football you have to have at least 7 players on the line of scrimmage. You can have more, but some of your players are then "covered" by others and are no longer eligible. What's the point of this rule? What if you allowed the offense to put a few people on the line of scrimmage as they liked? Or, if it's necessary to have five offensive linemen on the line of scrimmage for some reason, why force two receivers to be on the line as well?
