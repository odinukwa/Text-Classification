There are two possible things at work here. They may be sad that "John" who was good guy personally even if not that good at his job is unemployed or they may be worried about their own jobs. First, make sure that people know that the company is not downsizing and their own jobs are not at risk. This should eliminate some of that vague uneasiness when people get scared that they are next. If you have team members who are also having performance problems, you need to talk to them one on one and discuss what they specifically can do to avoid being the next one to go. As far as the team being down for a day or so, accept that this is normal and don't try to get them all happy. It is normal to be sad when someone you personally like gets fired even if you are glad that they are gone for professional reasons. Don't try to work against normal emotions. If the down feeling lasts more than a day or so, then they may still be nervous about their own job and what kind of mistakes will get them fired. If it goes on for more than a day, I would talk to people individually to find out what is bothering them and then use that information to try to mitigate whatever the concern is. Whatever you say, it is none of their business why "John" got fired and you should not disclose the details. You should however, let them know (and not at the time you fire someone) what steps you will take to improve performance before it gets to firing. That way people who haven't had any of those steps will feel more confident and those who have been put on a performance improvement program are more aware that this is serious stuff and not improving will get you fired. You might also make sure everyone knows that you don't expect anyone to be mistake free. Timing is another issue. Try really hard not to fire the week before a major deadline. Trying to pick up what someone else hasn't finished at the last minute when you are already stressed trying to get your current assignments done will just add to the stress of a launch week. If the person was not going to make the deadline and that is a good part of why he got canned, take the less important unfinished tasks out of the sprint or release so that the person assigned to fix his bad work only has to worry about that. And if possible move the deadline because if the person was that bad, the person getting the task instead may have to throw out what he did and start over and can't actually physically meet the deadline. People are less stressed when they know that you understand that fixing a mess may take longer that the time you have left. What I am really trying to say here, is don't wait until you know a deadline is going to be missed to fire someone. Catch bad performance earlier than that. Firing in conjunction with a deadline will frighten people even more. And the the next time a deadline comes up, they will become afraid to tell you if they are behind. 

It has been my experience that fewer companies are hiring due to end of the year budget issues and the lack of availablity of decision makers due to using up vacation time. However, it has also been my experience that fewer people are looking at that time (holidays put a lot of time pressure on many of us and, well, we often are just focused on time off at that point and some companies give end of the year bonuses so leaving could havea a financial impact) and the companies that are hiring often want to hire before the end of the year for budget reasons or because they really urgently need the position filled. So there may be fewer jobs but less competition for them. All in all if you are willing to forgo any end of the year bonus, it can be an effective time to search for and get a job. But don't expect that the current company will pay out a bonus if you leave. You may try to negotiate with the company doing the hiring to give you a signing bonus since you will miss out on a bonus though. But don't ask for this after you have accepted the offer. 

The first, most critical, thing you can do is start reading about office politics. A supervisor who is inept at politics harms the people working for him as well as himself. You need to understand politics to get your people the raises they deserve, to keep the projects on track, etc. You need to start building organizational allies. Some reading on communication styles is helpful as well. Deborah Tannen has some good books on this subject. Getting to know the people on the business side that you are developing products for is very helpful. You need to balance their needs with the team's ability to fulfill them, so you really need to understand where they are coming from. If your users are outside the company, you need to find a way to connect with those people as well to start to understand their perspective. Some technical conferences also have soft skills training. Wouldn't hurt to attend one of those and attend some of teh soft skills sessions. Not sure how to prep you for making difficult decisions that affect the lives of people who work for you. All I can say is that through the years, I have noticed that this is one of the big make or break things about a good supervisor and that putting off a negative decision tends to make it worse in the long run. Telling the client that you won't meet the deadline is much worse after you have missed it than weeks ahead. Telling someone they are being fired is much worse that telling them they have a performance issue and exactly what they need to overcome it and then helping them do so. I have noticed that a team will react better to negative news from a supervisor they trust to look out for them with the people above their group. It would also be helpful to get with your HR department and get training on the processes you need to know about as a supervisor including such things as time reporting, dealing with performance problems, how to do performance evaluations and set annual goals, etc. Know the process for dealing with a performance problem for instance can help keep you from doing the wrong thing before you ask for HRs help. 

I would ask a great deal about how the offshoring works. Are they employees or are they contractors. How much authority do you have to determine the quality of their work or their ability to meet deadlines. Will you be allowed to interface directly with the developers or will you be going through a manager at their end. What kind of of detail is required in requirement documentation? Are any of the developers or managers in India familiar with how business is done in Germany and have any of them traveled to Germany for training or coming up to speed. Do you have an opportunity to visit them onsite or do they have an opportunity to come to your office particularly as a project kicks off? I've worked with several different contractor companies in India and they are not all the same and the details of how the work is managed through them are critical to the success of your project. 

Suggesting a complete start over and rewrite is not going to go over well. You can suggest gradual refactoring and even that is a hard sell. This is especially true if the code was accepted by the client already as then the contracting company would have to pay out their own pocket for the rewrite and they would lose money on the contract. There is roughly a 0% chance that this would be well-received and even less that it would be done. In fact some of those bad choices may have been at the specific request of the client. You don't know the history of why they did what they did. What you do instead is make suggestions for improvement on each module you touch. Even then, if many other areas are affected, expect a good bit of push back. If it is something that is self-contained, then you can improve it more freely. And don't do so until you have a good working set of unit tests. You will lose all credibility if your improvements break something else or introduce new bugs. 

In my experience, good leaders apologize when they make a mistake. If the mistake was public, they apologize publicly. If the mistake was private (did not happen in front of others or in a situation where others would be aware of it), they may apologize privately. In a structure where there is a required obedience such as the military, there is still the need for an apology but it may not be as overt. Sometimes, just changing the decision is all the apology you are going to get in operational circumstances. However, the good military officers I worked with did acknowledge mistakes and apologize when needed and especially when it wasn't crunch time. After all who wants to follow a leader that won't take input ever from subordinates even when he is wrong? Senior enlisted people are generally well trained in how to correct an officer when he is wrong as well without disrupting the chain of command. So the corrections happen subtly and so do the apologies, but everyone knows what really happened. One Naval Officer I had the misfortune to work with ended his military career because he was unwilling to hear any objections to what he wanted or admit to a mistake. He told the enlisted people to turn the wrong way and ran the ship aground. Because he was not the kind of person that you could ever question, his guys did what they were told even though they knew it was the wrong thing and would cost him his career. Knowing what a jerk he was when I worked with him (mercifully I was a civilian employee and could toss him out of my office when he got obnoxious), I have no doubt they are still laughing about how they got him back by explicitly obeying a stupid order. 

Excellent question. I think those of us who have been in the workplace for a long time have run into at least a few of these projects. We have seen people fail after one and people rise above and go on to better things. The first thing you need to understand is that when a project is failing, it even more important than usual for you to play the office politics game. Yes I know you didn't want to hear that! However, while on a failing project, the only thing managers are hearing about you is your name in association with something bad. It is up to you to find small successes and other good things for them to hear about you to mitigate the stink of failure. Every single person I have seen whose career got permanently derailed at a company due to a failed project was someone who refused to play the political game. This made them even more of a target for the blame because they didn't even try to counteract it. This is not the time to sit on the sidelines and think office politics are bad. Office politics are what will save your career. In this situation they are a really good thing. Now mind you, you will probably at least have a temporary derailment. You are going to have to prove yourself on the next few projects before the smell of failure fades completely away. It simply takes several successes (or one amazing success) to overcome a failure in other people's perceptions. You should make sure to put in the extra effort on the next project, too. You will want to look around to find the next project you want to get assigned to. Something that is likely to succeed and something where you will have a chance to do well. Then once you identify that project, you need to lobby (oh no back to those pesky office politics again) to get assigned to it. You need to talk to the manager, you need to show them what skills you have that the project could benefit from and you need to give them assurance that the failure you are currently involved in not going to happen again if they take you on. When you do go on to the next project, you will want to sit down with your manager and talk honestly about the problems you saw on the other project and how we can make sure this one doesn't derail on the same points. Remember it is a lot easier to make changes to broken processes at the beginning of a project than in the middle. Two big failures in a row is not going to help rehabilitate your reputation. Plus honestly assessing the mistakes you made and how you are going to do things differently will help give the new manager confidence that you learned something from the failure. Now for another hard truth. Your own actions (or lack of actions) contributed to the failure. Until you recognize how you personally could have made better choices early on and done things differently, you have a good chance of going from failed project to failed project - always blaming something or someone else. Yes there are factors outside your control but not as many of them as you think. So use every failed project as a learning experience. What could you have done differently? Another thing to think about while the failure is happening is that the people who manage to fix the problem are going to get a lot of political credit and look really good. The best way to mitigate a failure is to find a way to turn the project around (Not always possible I admit, but definitely not possible if you don't try.) So stop whining about how bad things are and start thinking of how things can be salvaged. Recently I was involved in a project that was a disaster from day one, but several of us managed to get the people who caused the problems out of the way and turned around a multimillion dollar account that we were about to lose. The client now sings our praises and all of us involved in turning the project around got awards and cash bonuses. But to do that we had to make some major changes in how the client relationships were handled and how we did our project planning and development. We had to start with telling the client the truth about the problems and how we planned to fix them. It wasn't pleasant and it wasn't easy, but it was personally and professionally satisfying.
