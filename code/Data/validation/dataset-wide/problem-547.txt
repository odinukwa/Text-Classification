My mother is 60+ years old and 200+ lbs. She never learned to ride a bicycle, so she rides a Schwinn Town & Country adult tricycle. She loves it and rides it everyday, 2-5 miles everyday. The spokes on the rear right wheel keep breaking. In the past year, since she's had the trike, she must have had 5-10 spokes replaced. The right wheel is also the "Drive" wheel, and the only wheel giving her problems. Could it be a shoddy wheel? a bad wheel builder? What could be done to fix this? Stronger spokes? Replace the whole wheel for a new one? I need help and I'm officially out of ideas... 

I'm speaking from personal experience here. Looking at the bicycle from the back. The drive train is on the right side, and when you use the kickstand it leans to the left. When I commute to work, I tend to put my messenger bag with rear rack attachments on the left side. Mostly because the bike is already leaning that way. Once, when I was getting ready to leave work. I placed the bag on the right, and proceed to begin to tie my pants so they wouldn't get caught in the chain. The whole bike, bag and all, fell right on top of me. The incline of that particular part of the parking lot and the weight of the bag were enough to throw the whole bike of balance and rendered the kickstand useless. Since then, I've always put my bag on the left side. The idea of my bike falling on the right side and bending or breaking a derailleur just freaks me out since I've yet to learn how to fix them or adjust them. 

Aside from the rear spacing needing to be roughly consistent (you can probably fit a wider hub into a frame with a margin of around 10mm without much ill-effect) you'll need to worry about the chainline, which is the correct alignment of the rear sprocket on your Alfine or Nexus hub and the chainring (possibly what you're referring to as the crank – or crack – spacing). Never heard of Hercules bikes, but if it were a multispeed bike with 2 chainrings, then you have some wiggle room. I've converted a few 10-speeds to singles and fixies and have usually been able to find a combination of crank, bottom bracket and spindle size to provide a chainline within an acceptable range. You also have both the inside and the outside of the crank bolt holes to work with. Again, not knowing what a Hercules is, you may have to replace the crankset (if it's a one-piece BMX crank or a cottered crank then you'll definitely need to replace it). The expensive (or, if you're up for the challenge, difficult) part of this is going to be building the wheel around the hub, unless you can find a pre-built wheel with an Alfine/Nexus hub in the right wheelsize and rear spacing. Here's a guide on frame spacing that will come in handy: $URL$ 

If anyone can help I'd be grateful for your knowledge. Won't change anything of course; the bike is still a pleasure to ride irrespective of its provenance. 

The reason to avoid using, say, the larger front chainring with the larger rear sprockets (or vice versa) is nothing to do with loss of efficiency or anything like that, but because of a phenomenon called . If you're in the smaller chainring, which is more inboard, then you should be on the more inboard rear sprockets, the larger ones, and similarly, when your in the more outboard chainring, the larger chainring, you should be on the more outboard, smaller sprockets. Cross chaining happens when the chain has to cross from being inboard at the cassette, to being outboard at the cranks. Cross chaining puts quite a lot of stress on your chain and gears, can lead to a noisy, squeaky drivetrain (chain rubbing against the inside plate of the front derailer, for example), and causes your chain to wear quicker. Quicker chain wear then leads to quicker cassette wear, and quicker chainring wear. This is why gears are positioned as they are, to encourage you to use the bottom 7 rear gears with the smaller front chainring, and the top 7 rear gears with the larger front chainring. This means that the middle 4 rear sprockets (on a ten speed bike) can be used on either front gear, while the bottom 3 and top 3 should be used with the corresponding chainring. A typical change-up (based on a 53-39 front, 11-23 rear setup) will go like this: Start off low, maybe 39-21, change the rear up until you get to maybe 39-15, then shift to the larger chainring and at the same time, do what's known as a , which is shifting the rear gear down 2 or so sprockets so that jumping from the small to the big ring isn't such a massive increase in gear (53-15 compared with 39-15). This way you find yourself in 53-19 with a good, steady cadence. Then simply proceed up the sprockets as far as you need. A change-down might go in reverse, or you might simply change to the smaller ring when you get down to the middle sprocket if you know you're going to be slowing for some traffic lights, or getting prepared for a climb. I see too many cyclists simply going into lower gears in their rear sprockets while leaving the front in the big ring. It's a good idea to stick your head between your legs every once in a while to see where your gears are. Without those fancy indicators on your brifters and shifters, you can forget which ring you're in! 

I have bought 6 bikes in the last 5 years. 5 of those bikes have been Trek bikes. Not because I love the brand, but because the bike shop that I bought the bikes from tries really hard to make my wife happy. Our LBS tries really hard to keep her on the road, and that is not an easy thing. she's 5'2" with a long torso and short legs. Not exactly the easiest fit for road bikes and mountain bikes. Long story, short. We visited every single LBS in a 35 mile radius from our house and as soon as my wife tried one bike, or as soon as they saw her, we got turned away with nothing more than a "sorry, we have no bikes that will fit your body type." As a last ditch effort, we visited what is now "our" LBS (the only one I visit now, four years later). They told us about their extensive line of bikes and how they could find a bike for her. Trek Skye 13". Four bikes later (all Trek brand btw), I've become a bit of a Trek fanboy. These are the line of bikes as I understand them. 

I usually carry a park tool emergency boot in case of big tears on the tires. When in need and desperate, a dollar bill along the inside of the tire where the crack or tear is on the tire does the job too. Just keep in mind that it's a very temporary fix and a replacement tire should be bought as soon as humanly possible. Just make sure not wrap the dollar bill around the entire inner tube. Be Safe and Be Green. 

I did an unsupported century last year on my 30 pound "shop" mountain bike. The first 55 miles were easy but the last 45 or so were pretty horrible. This year, I want to try it again but with more hills. I really don't want to lug my 30 pound mountain bike up the hills, but I don't have the money for a decent road bike. If I follow a reasonable training plan on my 30 pound mountain bike this year, will I be "safe" moving into high-dollar 15 pound rental road bike 24 hours before an unsupported century? WARNING: This question was edited from its original version. It originally used the term "homemade" century to denote an unsupported century. Also, the question originally asked if it would be okay to switch to a road bike the day of the mentioned century. Now, the question asks if it is safe to switch 24 hours before the mentioned century. 

Is it feasible for an experienced single seat cyclist to serve as captain of a tandem bicycle and effectively "pull" the stoker behind as if the said stoker was riding in a trailer? It's understood the said stoker will be required to maintain some cadence and balance, but it seems possible that a sufficiently skilled single seat cyclist would theoretically be able to compensate for significant stoker errors. Additionally, I know it would help if the captain had tandem experience, but some experienced single seat cyclists may not have time to try out a tandem before pairing with an inexperienced stoker. 

When I'm alone and plodding along the shoulder of a state highway, I like to stand up to catch a wind gust as large vehicles "fly" by me. The amount of "fun" I get from this is exponentially proportional to the size of the passing vehicle. Unfortunately, I have a few concerns regarding my mischievous behavior. Since my average speed is about 15 MPH [1], I'm typically only in the slipstream of the said vehicles for a short period of time. Does standing up for this short period of time actually give me a substantial increase in speed? Also, I often wear highly recognizable clothing and/or gear. There may be a few non-cyclist motorists that recognize me. I'm concerned that my act of standing up right before I'm getting passed could be perceived as "aggressive" behavior. If I continue to stand up to maximize my slipstream from passing motorists, do you think I will encourage some motorists to dislike me more than they already probably do? [1] - My maximum speed is 40 MPH but that's downhill. Also, I can typically get up to 20 MPH on a flat way when there is a strong tailwind.
