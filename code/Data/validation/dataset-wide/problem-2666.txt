(where Q does not appear in the argument). The psychological feature might overlap with some aspects of philosophy and be looked at in "experimental philosophy" but I would say it's no longer then primarily about "fallacies" but fallacy as used in philosophy means an error in the reasoning of an argument. Ergo, if there is no argument, there can be no fallacy. 

The long place to go is Philosophy of Right which is an entire book about the nature of free will in Hegel's philosophy. There's some moderately readable commentaries written by Thom Brooks) and Dudley Knowles. Less readable but rather magnificent in scope is Modern Freedom by Adriaan Peperzak. Pelcynski is also pretty good. The short place to go Hegel's encyclopedias. Conifold's answer (presumably) will point you to the right section. 

In its current form (9/22), you make a big assumption that seems deeply inaccurate when you state I don't know anyone who ascribes to that position. The argument is about whether all things that are "interesting or useful to say about life" are per ipse philosophy OR whether philosophy refers to a particular tradition that descends from Plato and considers these questions. And then whether similar traditions elsewhere should be included by extension or not. Stated another way, no one faults biology for not being physics, and several people who oppose including other traditions in the definition of philosophy do so not because they think such things are uninteresting but because they don't think interesting = philosophy. (This seems to be for instance the position maintained by both Leiter and Tampio in their dissents from the need to include everything and anything interesting in philosophy). Or to give a second analogy, is learning Danish philosophy? I find learning Danish to be very interesting and raise questions about how life works, but I don't for a second imagine that it should be a required part of any program. There's been quite a lot of discussion about how white, dead, and male the canon is. But when I say discussion I mean I've seen it the most not as philosophical treatise but as question concerning the profession (i.e. teaching in universities, publishing in journals) than in actual books and publications.. 

For this, students are often bothered by the truthfulness of the operator when the antecedent is false. They wonder legitimately why a false antencedent should be able to give us a truth value for the entire claim. What McGinn seems to have missed which many of my students understood is that if-then != -->. One must keep in mind what is meant by the natural language before translating it into symbolic language. And that means sometimes that one must translate it to something else. In other words, I think McGinn is creating his own problems by imagining a strict correlation where there is a strong one. I place the problem not with modus ponens but with thick-headed symbolization. 

Direct receipt of divine commands There's going to be an interaction between one's account of "inerrancy" / "progressive revelation" / "error" in relation to the holy book. For instance, you could believe the bible contains divine commands but not everything attribute to God is a command from God (or conversely you could hold that every thing in the bible is so). This is going to be a bit of sliding scale (with all the problems incumbent on picking and choosing passages within the text). There are also counterfactual believers in DCT who assert that if there were a God, divine commands would be a definitive source of moral knowledge. (I'm trying to remember who advocated this but am drawing a blank). 

As I stated above, I do want to address your conclusion in the question and the thought that existentialism should not be called philosophy. First off, if we grant your definition of philosophy, i.e. "logical analysis" and fill out what that means, you're probably right -- existentialism should not then be called philosophy. But if what you mean parses to "the application of symbolic logic to claims" and the consideration of things insofar as they are bound and unbound variables, then all sorts of other things we regularly consider philosophy aren't either. On that definition, the first philosophers appeared in the late 19th century, because the methodologies prior to that were not largely based on symbolic logic. That seems problematic. Given this dichotomy, it seems best to reject this as the definition of philosophy. Why, then, would someone assert this definition? Clearly, the goal is to exclude certain methods and views from the realm of philosophy. A better definition might be either the tradition of thinking that grows out of Plato. This would put most everything we've thought of as philosophy over time into philosophy. Maybe in the 21st Century, we can give it a less Euro-centric version and refer to the equivalent considerations in other traditions as well. If you want to heap opprobrium onto "existentialists," writing them out of philosophy by definition does not seem very viable to me. I would instead suggest the following -- instead, assert that you think "existentialists" do philosophy poorly, that they get caught up on immaterial things and don't focus on questions that grasp the nature of reality well. And then argue as to how this is so (preferably in a non-question-begging manner if we're trying to do philosophy). 

In other words, there's two categories of things and something can at most belong to one of the categories. Unfortunately, I don't think that's what we have here. I think we have something more like: 

I am going to give an answer in broadly Aristotelian terms. The key difference is numerical identity -- which just means that you are separate from your clone. In other words, you and your clone are separate self-sustaining systems. Whatever else you have in common with your clone, each of you is a type of organism that engages in self-maintenance through ingestion, processing (metabolism), and expulsion of materials that keep you as roughly the same thing. Metabolism is merely the process by which the sort of organisms we are maintains itself. You can say this in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian ways, you could say you and your clone have distinct souls (here meaning forms of a living thing are self-sustaining). You could say you and your clone have distinct haecity. You can say you are numerically different. You can say you are different time worms or that you can endure separately. Basically metabolism is a process of a system. A clone is a distinct system that has its own processes. 

An argument that contains an inconsistent definition is guilty of "equivocation" because it fails to use the same term with the same meaning throughout. This is a type of "informal fallacy" because disputants could in principle disagree about whether what is happening is a material equivocation or meaningless (where the change in definition between statements/premises/conclusion does not matter). Whether this has an impact of the validity of a deductive argument, the soundness of a deductive argument, or the strength of other arguments will depend on what happens when/if you resolve the equivocation. 

Think of "Knight" true and "Knave" as false. Then expand by considering that what each person says is a type of conditional. i.e., if Albert is a knight than what he says is true. If he's a knave, then it's false. This will give you the following translations: 

The reconfiguration of work from a communal affair -- all farming in the field to working in factories producing goods for people you never see The corresponding introduction of class where there is now a laboring class and a management class and a bourgeois class that buys the goods and has the numbers to keep the laboring peasants down. (Here, we are talking about what Hegel calls recognition, i.e. Master and Slave). 

First, you must be using humanist in an idiosyncratic way. There's no necessary exclusion between believing in God or having the values of society and being a humanist. There's a speech that gives at least one humanist's answer: Existentialism is a Humanism by Jean-Paul Sartre. You could start there. In that text Sartre argues that even if there is an external meaning to life as supplied by God or some other force, it is ultimately still up to each individual to figure out why they are alive and what purpose they think life has. Using the example of a solider who needs to decide whether to fight for France as a patriot or to obey the [Roman Catholic] Church and his mother and become a priest, Sartre points out that all of our beliefs are to some extent chosen. I'm not necessarily in agreement with Sartre, but I think Sartre does make the valid point that we shouldn't identify choosing as the problem with purposes in life. Your critique might still remain but with the qualification mere choosing. Sartre's account is actually quite similar to Heidegger's in this respect since for Heidegger the meaning of our lives is that we die. Thus, the challenge is that we need to accept that and still live. (For this reason, Heidegger was sometimes called an existentialist though he denied the label). For a more elaborate version of the critique you raise against choosing one's own purpose in life, I think the best choice is to turn to Kierkegaard's pseudonym Anti-Climacus and specifically the text The Sickness unto Death. While not denying the need to make a choice towards a purpose in life, he points out that choosing a purpose of one's own origination lasts only as long as the willing toward that purpose lasts. i.e., as long as I want to find my identity in my political persuasion, I can do so. But the moment I stop doing so, the entire identity is lost. For Anti-Climacus, the solution is to find your identity in how God identifies you and depend on that fixity. (I have a forthcoming paper on this topic in IPQ later this year). 

I think one thing that would help your line of questioning a bit is that you can restrict your question to this: can you love two people maximally and equally. It seems obvious and intuitive that I can love/value people equally. For instance, there's a category of people who I do not know. For such people, I value them as human beings and from this ascribe to them moral value. As far as I can tell all such people are people I value equally. There's also a lot of open questions as demonstrated by the comments whether valuing/loving people can be reduced to a single composite value (or perhaps whether even if there are numeric (or more generally ordinal) values for valuing people). For instance, I may have friends that I love playing board games with, and other friends that I like to talk about heavy matters with, but I might "love them equally" under some valuation. It seems the area where this might pose an issue is something like this: 

So clay is a kind of weird mixture of dirt and other things rather than completely unformed matter, and while you've pounded the clay into a car shape, that doesn't make it a car. Put another way, the clay car is going to break down over time and lose that kind of car-shaped nature as it gets battered. It doesn't resist this in the same way as a child would. A real car doesn't fare much better because it's just a lot of matter we have forced together to do something for us. There are others who have extended his account to artifacts, but he explicitly claims that they are not included. (See more here: Artifacts as substances in Aristotelian metaphysics Also see: Hylomophism as the foundation of matter, how true can this be. explain) 

In the above A = assumption, | means we are in a subproof, DN = double negation, MT = modus tollens, MP = modus ponens, CP = conditional proof, &I = conjunction introduction, and BiCond Int = biconditional introduction. For some proof systems, you need to use R to repeat things to use them in subproofs (omitted). The largest dependency in the above is MT. If you need to avoid it, then the basic pattern is: 

On these simple definitions it sounds like one could maintain a view of truth that is the conjunction of these views (coherence + correspondence). What is missing from the simple definitions is that coherence theory (as a view positively held under that name ) is a rejection of the correspondence theory. In other words to advocate the coherence theory is to reject that truth is about correspondence to a world fact (however parsed). In other words, we could say coherence = the coherence thesis and the negation of the correspondence thesis. This would give us "truth of any (true) proposition consists merely in its coherence with some specified set of propositions" 

The general answer that I am familiar with in regards Gonsung Long's argument is that he's engaged in a denial of essences (性 xing). And his point is that if being a white horse is different than being a horse in general, then the essence of horseness is nothing but a name, and being white is nothing but a name, and "white horse" does not pick out those horses that happen to be white, but only the thing that is a "white horse". At the root of this is an extension of something Taoists might believe about the nature of reality, viz., not only are there no essences but there are also no discrete beings. So the idea that the white horse that appears before him must fall under both the category horse and white is in part supposed to be an argument against essences on the basis of their infinite multiplication (we would need tall white horse, short white horse, etc. to each represent 3, and as we add qualities, we would end up with infinite essences). (I qualify the above paragraph with "might" because one of the challenges for the student of Taoist philosophy is to try to bubble a theory out of ancient texts that are certainly written by a variety of authors and edited together by people who may not have shared their views).
