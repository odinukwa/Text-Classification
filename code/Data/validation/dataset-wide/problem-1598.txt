A statistically larger sample would help here. The predictability of random choices transfers to more than just colours and numbers. 

The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis provides no references, but concur in their website's FAQ: 

Note: This is limited to Denmark, young adults and heterosexuals, and it is only a single study (the first I found; I didn't cherry-pick.) However, it is sufficient to address the question, by revealing how the original statistic was misleading, and not as astonishing as it originally sounds. While this is a survey and participants may have lied in the answers, we might expect that there would be more cultural pressure for women to: 

They go one to warn that two-ply threads may effectively double the thread-count without necessarily being less coarse, and the coarseness of the threads may make similar thread-counts feel different. Linen Place is a retailer (and therefore might have a conflict of interest) but in their explanation "The Truth about Thread Count", they explain the (US) FTC have made rulings about the definition of thread-count (and how the manufacturers have responded), so the situation may be different by country. 

There may be some areas where foot orthotics might have a benefit. This review concludes that they are largely ineffective at treating pain or preventing injury, but that there is some evidence of helping with plantar fasciitis, posterior tibial stress fractures, and patellofemoral pain syndrome. Mainly, it suggests more high-quality evidence is required. There are also unrelated situations where orthotics may assist. The New York Times had an article discussing the controversy. 

Conflicting studies? Time to look for a meta-analysis. The Cochrane Collaboration don't know yet, but they plan to find out. Does aspirin have any adverse side-effects? Yes. Many, many side-effects - generally mild or rare. This (unreferenced, but likely reliable) pharmaceuticals site lists many of them. Here are some reduced highlights: 

In the question you (indirectly) refer to a Vine video by Logan Paul which you acknowledge as fake. The gif is derived from a Vine video by- you guessed it! - Logan Paul - it is the same stunt performer in both videos. Granted, it is remotely possible that the first video was a fake and six months later the same person did the same skill live, but I hope you will agree that this is strong evidence the second video was produced using similar camera-trick techniques. 

[An aside, before I start: I think your question about the mechanism is a reasonable one, but I trust your skepticism, upon gathering more evidence, will lead you to provisionally accepting the evidence of a peer-reviewed controlled scientific experiment over a gut feel, if it turns out that the study holds it own! In particular, it doesn't take many drivers to be held up (or at least to perceive it that way) behind a cyclist, who have time to register the helmet and to cut too close to the rider, to sway the statistics.] I looked for any replication or criticism of the study. I started by finding the original study on Google Scholar. Then I skimmed through the 28 citations. (Google Scholar may not be the best Citation Index, but it is easy and free.) I couldn't see any replications (although this instrumented bike project sounded like a promising source.) It was (positively) cited in a number of other papers (e.g.), including reference to the helmets, suggesting other peers had found the experiment valid. I also discovered that Ian Walker had a personal blog. In one blog post, he explained he had achieved some infamy from the original article and highlighted a draft rebuttal by Dan Gutierrez (which includes an experimental result which, while not replicating the same helmet versus non-helmet experiment, suggested the helmet differences was minor compared to other factors.). Ian Walker then provided a defence to that rebuttal. In conclusion, yes, Ian Walker's paper has provoked a reaction from the cycling community, but the scientific community have, by and large, accepted the result. I found no replications, but hope that the instrumented bike project might offer such replications in the future. This was a rapidly performed literature review; a more detailed one may provide more support to either side. 

Without trying to diminish the risks, it is important to note that this is saying that some of the components (PM2.5 and formaldehyde) in the mosquito coil smoke (inhaled over an 8 hour period) were as bad as some of the components in a large number of cigarettes. There may be other compounds in cigarette smoke that also cause damage which are not found in mosquito coils. 

The claim is that the French summed up the cultural difference with a saying that translates to the given expression. To demonstrate that is true, I just need to find a large number of examples of people saying that in French. Challenge accepted! 

For the Tryptone Soya broth, the chlorine dip was better than water rinse and paper towel. For the beef contaminant, water rinse and paper towel was better. 

In a controversial show about cholesterol drugs, the Australian (ostensible) science show, Catalyst, reported an interview with Professor Rita Redberg: 

Blood banks weren't established until the 1930s, so being a blood donor could not have been a requirement. While a court of honor met as recently as 1990, this law was overturned in 1992. 

They can also be fortified with other nutrients such as Calcium. However, the milk must be labeled if they are fortified. There are limits to what can be added to milk and still call it "milk". (See Section 131.110 of Standards of Identity.) The fortification is optional, so it depends on the source. So, to see what additives are in your preferred brands of milk, check the labels. Before you discard the ones with more Vitamin A and D, ask if you are really concerned that the risks of extra vitamins outweigh the benefits - ditto with the fat content. However, Cornell University's Milk Facts suggests a motivation for additional Vitamin A fortification in skim milk: because it is naturally lower in vitamin A, it needs more added to bring it to the same levels as whole milk. 

You could conclude that all mammals are cathemeral, but such a strict definition removes the useful distinctions that nocturnal, diurnal and crepuscular offer. So, it is reasonable to use a looser definition and describe a species of bat as nocturnal, even though they are sometimes awaken during the day. 

So, a random guess of the first digit would be 10%, they brought that up to 20%. Further, they had a good second guess if the first one was incorrect. They measured their success in terms of the reduction in entropy, which for some measures ranged from 15% to 40%. While they claim "the classifiers perform significantly better than the random attack", I didn't see an analysis of the significance, which seems a serious shortfall. The paper performs a basic review of similar experiments. 

The Oxford Handbook of Hypnosis: Theory, Research and Practice introduces the term "hyperobedience" and draws similar conclusions from similar sources (page 748): 

There are several claims of quite different grades here. 1) Microchips can be removed without death. Here is a case study. Here is some legislation describing who is permitted to do so and what administrative action is required. Note: Based on stories I found on the net, it is difficult to find an vet who is willing to perform unnecessary surgery on an animal. 2) The chip can't be used to track the location of its wearer over long distances. RFId tags have limited ranges. (e.g. around 40' or 12m, depending on the conditions.) This isn't like the movies where it can be picked up by satellite. You need to have a sensor very near the device to read it. That still means it is plausible to have a sensor near, say, a cat-flap to detect whether a cat is in a particular area. Example 3) You can't meaningfully track the owner from the pet's chip. Unless the animal is a guidedog, the owner is generally not with the animal at all times. [Reference: Common knowledge about pets being left home while owners go out, and cats going out while owners stay home.] Even if you could track the pet, this would be of limited value in tracking the person. 4) If microchips cause cancer in cats and dogs, it is a very rare occurrence. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association responded to these claims, which were based on suspicions in lab-rats bred to be susceptible for cancer. 

However, they do have a detailed analysis of the reported cases of Human Trafficking in the Netherlands, and the numbers are disturbing, with over 900 victims reported in 2009. 

So, this isn't the stuff you use in balloons. The US had a stockpile, but it is dwindling. A shortage is predicted: 

Smokers are more likely to get diabetes. This idiotic risk reduction technique won't get you out of the frying pan into the fire - it will leave you in the frying pan and the fire! Negative Correlation - Obesity For obesity, I have to accept that there is an association between obesity and never smoking: 

Thijs Zonneveld, a former cyclist, made a joke that a 2,000m high artificial mountain should be created in the Netherlands. Now, the mass media are reporting that it is being seriously considered: Example: Agence_France-Presse (AFP) 

Remember, when you see a person hesitating to respond, you are seeing the round-trip delay - therefore you need to double the total delays mentioned here. Note: Any delays for beeping out obscenities and the like will occur after the conversation is recorded. That is, you will hear the broadcast a few seconds later, but they won't interfere with the conversation being held between the interviewer and interviewee. Adding a 5-7 second delay at that point would make the conversation untenable. 

The allegations that they were permitted to leave before the flight bans were lifted was investigated by the 9/11 Commission. The commission's report has a section on this subject, titled "Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States", which asks the questions: 

While researching this, I found a number of people had found the ability of students to identify vegetables question interesting - as they studied whether familiarity with the vegetables made children more likely to eat them. [For example.] Finding the actual data from peer-reviewed studies was a little harder. This Master's Thesis showed that preschool students could fairly reliably identify carrots, but that is a common vegetable. This Honors Thesis showed that common fruit and vegetables where easier than others, for a sample of 40 children around 6 years of age. 

I couldn't find anything in the scientific literature, but then I thought I had found the answer. I read the description of an experiment performed by the BBC show The Truth About Food. Not peer-reviewed scientific journal, but perhaps the best you can hope for on a question that is unlikely to get normal funding. It sounded promising. Their video link is (currently) broken, but the segment is available on YouTube. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a terribly low-quality experiment. Three couples took part. (Flaw: sample too small to draw any strong conclusions.) The men were given a diets free of garlic, asparagus and alcohol, but high in one of spices, fish or fruit. (Flaw: There was no control to see if the changes were non-existent.) After three days, and kept in the dark about which diet was involved, the three women tasted the semen from a test-tube. (Flaw: There was no control; they relied on memory to compare; presumably with a faster and less formal presentation.) They were given four choices (including one "distractor" answer) to select between. (Flaw: The hypothesis was that changing diet could affect the taste in some way. The actual test was that it would affect the taste in a manner that was previously associated with the food. It would fail to detect if fruit actually made the semen more spicy in flavour, for example.) One of the three selected correctly - this is not significantly different to random guesses. (Do I need to do a detailed statistical analysis to prove this?) The reporter's conclusion was entirely facile: 

While these figures do not, unfortunately, focus directly on the OP's formulation of the question, which limits itself to the top 1%, it does provide strong evidence that the mobility of households from the lower quintiles to the upper ones is both lower and higher in European countries than the United States of America, as suggested by the original quote. 

So, learning English consisted, at least, of learning to sing the Alphabet song. The hacking consisted of working around an OEM attempt to limit the settings. Whether you consider discovering and using a bug to unlock existing functionality to be "hacking" depends entirely on your definition of "hacking". It is quite different from, say, developing a technique to "jail-break" an iPhone or rebuilding a kernel.
