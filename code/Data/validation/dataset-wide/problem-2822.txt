I am aware of two major modes of reasoning used for justification of belief: deductive and inductive. Whereas physics relies on induction, mathematics seems to rely exclusively on deductive inference, which ensures the soundness of its conclusions. Is that correct? Are there other modes of inference used in mathematics? Also, to be precise, what I am after here are the admissible modes of inference used for justification in the final product of mathematics, not the types of inferences mathematicians use in their daily work to generate mathematics. For inductive reasoning, what I have in mind here is what is explaining in this entry of the SEP. (if there is nothing in mathematics but deduction, mathematics is an extension of logic, and there is no other way to see the situation) 

Sometimes in physics, the mathematics leads to "un-physical solutions or terms", that are readily tossed by the physicist. For example, when deriving absorption and emission rates for via quantized light-atom interactions in quantum optics class, we toss out 2 terms from the Hamiltonian, on the grounds that they don't correspond to any observed physical process: 

I'm not sure why 5 + 7 = 12 should say anything new: I take it to be a shorthand notation to give a name to 5 + 7, which anyway is nothing but 5 times the unit + 7 times the unit, so there is not really anything "new" here. Or is there? If we see it the other way around, as 12 = 5 + 7, maybe 5 + 7 is not contained in 12: we have a set of 12 objects, and we say that we can see it as a subset of 5 objects + a subset of 7 objects, so we say that that subdivision of the original set of cardinality 12 exists. But is that really "new"? Of course, 5 + 7 = 12 is cited as an example at the beginning of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, when he explains his view of analytic and synthetic knowledge. The question here though is not meant to criticize analytic judgments, but rather to criticize synthetic a priori judgments. I believe (for the sake of argument) that mathematics is composed entirely of analytic judgments, not synthetic ones, and I am trying to understand why Kant could argue at all that mathematics was in the synthetic camp. More precisely. To define analytic and synthetic judgments, Kant writes at the beginning of the Critique of Pure reason, 2nd ed (emphasis mine): 

Use the Categorical Imperative to find out what duty demands by asking "Ought one(, meaning anyone,) save the children?" Anyone, any rational being, in this situation ought to do that. Secondarily, one would have to read or interpret one's duty into the situation. Thus, ask, does the practical situation stop me from performing my duty? For instance if they were so far out in the water one couldn't get to them without great risk of drowning as well. The duty tells you what action to aim at. And, also, how the legal system ought to regard your action or failure to act. It is a predelineation, as a guidance about the best behavior, which must be weighed against the practical reality. 

The question requires some determinations or clarifications. The context in which I'm asking the question, apart from the contemporary world, is the claim of the Catholic Church, following Thomas Aquinas, that: even God can not make a triangle with angles not equal to two Right Angles. (This is part of the definition of the technical term "omnipotence".) I'm going to try to ask some Catholics this question too. When one brings in the non-euclidean, one makes an appeal, it seems, to shapes that are not available to the senses. For that reason even though men were always able to make such a geometry, until maths were used in the modern way, for predictive physical modeling, they were not developed until quite recent times, the Enlightenment. In one sense, one says, any geometry is true, the Euclidean is true, and can never be "disproved", but this is said with respect to the formal character of geometry. Not to the shapes as they are for the senses, abstractly represented by the so-called universals or perfect abstractions, of a geometry. If geometry refers to real shapes, in the world, and if the Thomistic decretal, as it were, is taken to speak to the limits of God's will, that it is limited by the order of nature, and that what is said in the statement about the sum of the angles is false, does it not suggest there is no order? I.e., because if the non-euclidean corresponds to something, in that order, is it not, in a certain sense limitless, and never truly subsumable under the statements of a geometry? Thus, in any serious sense there is no order to speak of. One would always find more. 

Maybe we want meaning, but Nature doesn't give us meaning - it is arbitrary, uncontrollable... That would be very unsettling and anxiety provoking, and would compel us to create a meaning for ourselves in this world that doesn't offer any. So, through the experience of being in a meaningless world, we experience the need for meaning. 

So my question is why does Kant further say that Der arithmetische Satz ist also jederzeit synthetisch (Arithmetical propositions are therefore always synthetical): what is ganz au√üer in 5 + 7 = 12, if we see 12 as just a convenient short name for 5 + 7? 

If mathematics is concerned with deductive reasoning, and relies on logic to ensure the soundness of its derivations, if on the other hand, the derivations of mathematics, at least in a philosophical and modern view of the subject, start from arbitrary axioms, can mathematics be reduced to arbitrary axioms and logic? Note: arbitrary here means that mathematicians are a priori free to choose an initial set of axioms, as in e.g. Euclidean vs non-Euclidean geometries, that they are not constrained by observations of the natural world in the choice of axioms to derive theorems from. 

If reducing mathematics to logic is the goal of logicism, what other conceptions of mathematics are there? 

Here is a basic working definition of a law of physics from the point of view of a physicist. It does lead to several interesting philosophical questions, which I completely ignore (but am very well aware of). A law of physics is a provisional statement of an observed regularity in Nature. We formulate laws of physics to understand the world around us, and also to control it or act in it (not always: a good deal of astronomy for example deals with things that we will never control). A law of physics summarizes many instances of a given phenomenon in a convenient manner. For example, the law of gravitation summarizes in one formula how objects fall towards the ground as well as how planets go around the Sun. An observed regularity is something that holds in many, most or all observed instances of a phenomenon. A law is always provisional in the sense that a more encompassing or more precise statement of a regularity may have to be made later, given more observations. The laws of physics are usually numerical, holding between observable quantities that can be measured, so that the laws take a precise, mathematical form. However, there can be individual instances of measurements that do not exactly conform to the mathematical law at hand: there can be errors due to the measurement equipment or procedure, or fundamental uncertainty as in the case of quantum mechanics. This gives a statistical character to the laws of physics, and it is usually required to estimate the uncertainty in the measurements. A very basic example, but one that is IMHO worthwhile keeping in mind as a good image of a law of physics, would be the following picture, where we have observed a number of data points, and plotted the line (model/law) that bests fits these observations. It shows what the law/model is: the line, i.e. 2 coefficients a and b in a formula y = ax + b. This line summarizes the data points, it is the regularity/invariant underlying the phenomenon. It also allows interpolation and prediction to calculate unmeasured values of y for values of x. Finally, it shows the notion of error in measurement, as many actual points lie close to the line, but not exactly on it. 

I think if one is making an argument that assumes there is common sense, and it is basically clear and distinct, i.e., scientific, then it follows that all arguments that won't work on an intelligent but stubborn elderly fellow, ought to be thrown out, then there are either good arguments or ones that don't convince. On the other hand, once one assumes that there is a question about common sense, all kinds of opacity follows. And anything can be justified on this basis, so that the matter of distinguishing serious from frivolous becomes a matter of special ability. Just as not anyone can make sound judgments about music or other issues, basically objective (as a sense is, not as the sciences are), but requiring talent. Thus, elitism becomes a great charge, and many other charges come in due to various forms difficulty, both in the current system of training, the universities, and for reasons intrinsic to an activity which at the peak, only a very few are competent to judge. 

Hegel welcomes all to join the rational society, the one that has achieved the moral peak. That's no different for him than if one were to say that the discoveries of Descartes can be taught to anyone, the anylitical geometry, for instance. But, yet, it was derived by a Frenchman, and one wants to prove that in the development of World History, it had to be so. That is the point of the particularization of the Germans, not Nationalism or Jingoism, and of the whole work of Hegel. One might, to see things as Hegel did, consider the fact of post-Hegelian German scientific inventions, not as a matter of Patriotism, but of sheer wert-frei, value-free, reality. 

But if you understand it the origin doesn't matter, ad hominem (genetic fallacy) in the informal logical sense. The origin or genesis of the sentence, or proposition, may make us suspicious, may make us bring greater scrutiny to it, but it can not rule it out simpliciter as something that may speak the truth. The truth (on the most-widely accepted view, importantly, this is Descartes' view of truth) hangs on whether the thing said matches what is the case. That the thing is integral with the assertion in the sentence. For example, this is a sentence. You are now reading a sentence. Such must be true, whether or not the sentence got here due to the pernicious will of a treacherous being. -- Do you mean that you doubt what the sentence says is true? One could say that one takes it to be true, by devil's trick, but it is not true. That, I believe, is somehow unanswerable. Though, Nietzsche said that it makes no sense to assert that one doesn't exist. One says nothing at all. Since, "not existing", is put forward propositionally as a kind of existing. One might also possibly say, it seems to me, that one finds the whole issue unintelligible, that existence doesn't mean anything. Or, that the proposition can't say what it means to say.
