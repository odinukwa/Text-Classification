but did NOT provide a cite. Shame. (Ref: Managing Incomplete Tooth Fractures, J. Edward Ailor Jr., The Journal of the American Dental Association August 1, 2000 vol. 131 no. 8 1168-1174) In the book Endodontics: Principles and Practice, by Richard E Walton and Mahmoud Torabinejad, chapter 7, it is claimed: 

If the original formula calculated by Gallivan is correct, this shows that a standard piece of copy paper, even if it is extended a little, cannot be folded 8 times. 

This isn't a quality reference, so I am just using it to illustrate a point - that a "Minority Report"-style user interface may not actually be the ideal UI system for the future. These caveats are not suggestions that the product is a scam, but that there are normal business risks in dealing with yet-to-be-released products. 

In summary, the claims are both too specific to be precisely addressed by the extensive existing literature (in my searches) and too vague to be knocked down on first principles. 

So, the Daygens Nyheter summary seems reasonable. There was a study that did draw these conclusions. Whether the study itself is accurate is more difficult to assess. 

However, Wikipedia's definition of washout period suggests it is a period without treatment. Do clinical trials that measure drug side-effects use washout periods to screen out people with side-effects from the study, and thus bias their figures? 

The Wikipedia page pretty much answers the question, but I followed up a couple of sources, so I wasn't only relying on unreliable secondary sources. 

The claim is that it was first said by Oscar Wilde. Oscar Wilde died 30 November, 1900. However, the first recorded use of "sex" as a noun to refer to sexual intercourse was by D.H. Lawrence in 1929. The attribution to Wilde of the quote (as it stands) is anachronistic. Hat-tip to this Quoran 

This INE site shows the type of documents that are required for first time voters ("Primera vez"): Photo id, nationality documents and proof of address. 

I will take their word for the fact that the compounds don't occur in nature. Not only is the "natural" argument irrelevant (as they later point out themselves), but the reagents used are irrelevant, as the flouride is no longer attached to the rest of the compound once it is in solution. [Reference: Year 11 high school Chemistry class] I would, however, like citations for where flouridation promoters call it natural. Are they referring to the silicofluorides or to the idea of fluoride being dissolved in fresh water? 

However, in 2010, the US FDA released a Consumer Update: Some "Lead-Free" Pottery Can Still Taint Food. In it, they warn that some pottery labelled "lead-free" may still contain significant levels of lead, because of contamination of old kilns. 

The concept of "bone pointing" (a.k.a. Kurdaitcha) comes from some Australian aboriginal cultures. The idea - from Western eyes, at least - is that, once cursed, a victim becomes convinced that they will die, and soon after do. Many of the stories about such incidents are anecdotal, folklore or there may have been other more prosaic reasons for the death, but at least one case has been documented. Now, if this were true, you could argue that it is a situation where the brain has been tricked into dying. However, in the recorded case, the victim refused food, so perhaps it cannot be counted under your definition. 

Ed Yong wrote an article for the Not Rocket Science blog, which covers this area so well, I had to stop myself from simply quoting it all. I recommend reading it. It looked at, and summarised the article: 

This urban legend has been debunked so often and so consistently on the Internet, it is almost redundant to repeat it. Here are just some of the sources - including many medical experts and frog experts. 

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued a statement about Raw Milk. Raw Milk Misconceptions and the Danger of Raw Milk Consumption: 

A link to that committee's blog [Hat-tip to @tim for the link.] shows that Reuters appear to have made an error in citing that statistic. CFRB estimated that it would be the eighth-largest as a percentage of GDP. It would be fourth-largest in inflation-adjusted dollars. 

Before I start, I want to unpick some assumptions that appear in the question, that are common in nature-versus-nurture questions. When you ask "is there any proof that humor is genetics and not something you can learn?" you are introducing two false dichotomies. The firstly is that it suggests that an attribute is either 100% genetics or 0% genetics. That ignores the common option that genetics may account for some, but not all, of the variability. Secondly, it ignores other effects - such environmental factors, and personal factors unrelated to training. Epigenetics are another confusing factor that undermines the either-or nature. 

Hopefully, the face-to-face Hannity interview scheduled to be aired today (You aren't a publicist for Fox News, are you?) will put this to rest for all but the most hard-core conspiracy theorists. 

This is from the official web-site of the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It corroborates some of the details of the Event Data Recorders. However, it differs in a substantial manner. It does not say that the Obama administration gave their consent. It merely states that a proposal has been put forward. Further, it states: 

While it likely depends on definitions of mental disorder and the diagnostic procedure (especially on the eve of a new edition of the DSM), this number is not too high. It is too low. 

So, as of January 2014, it was too early to say whether such a treatment is going to work or is going to be safe. 

Since this question was written, the user interface seems to have changed, and the numbers differ by a small percentage, but the conclusion stands. Here is a current screenshot: 

Cecil Adams of the Straight Dope is a noted skeptic and debunker of myths, and was asked about this one He read a paper: 

In summary, while it depended on the year and the region, once could expect to receive mail every hour or two, with a lag of around an hour or so. This doesn't support the idea that a response might be typically expected within two hours, but it does suggest that such response times would be sometimes possible on a good day.

After a 12 week follow-up, 3 of the 10 patients available had returned to a diabetic condition. The take-home message that the authors seemed to push in their paper is that this offers hope for what was thought to be an irreversible condition, and some inkling of the causes for diabetes, rather than a ready-to-go cure.
