No, the use of auxiliaries is not directly linked to aspect, mood or tense in the first place. This may be so in some or many cases by coincidence when morphological or syntactic marking is not available, but the link between auxiliary verbs and TAM is not a logical necessity. On the one hand, there are (even in English) cases where the use of auxiliaries does not change aspect/mood/tense: 

Assuming that syntactic analysis is more interested in functional rather than lexical aspects, it would be not implausible that in general, certain POS categories can be subsumed under one syntactic category label in order to caputure syntactic commonalities between different word classes, while at the same time it seems possible to create syntactic lables that do not have a direct equivalent in POS classes at all if such a new category label is syntactically well-motivated. Still, this question is of course highly dependent on your presumed POS and syntactic inventory; the below list of word categories is to be seen as an approximation rather than universally representative: 

as is a preposition, their functions as a determiner (its POS would be a possessive pronoun), native is an adjective and language a simple noun. 

Sorry for the long post, it got longer that I had originally planned and probably not every detail is immediately important to the question. I just like giving some advanced information, felt that my original three-sentence answer didn't address the question in enough accuracy and hopefully visually distinguished the side information sufficiently. 

The latter two are taken from: Haegeman, L. & Guéron, Jacqueline (1999). English Grammar. A generative perspective. So maybe the words you mentioned are something like nouns which can act as both discrete and non-discrete abstract nouns, or receive both an accidental (?) or a generic interpretation, but still, I'm not sure this fits your example too well and also don't know of a unique term for it. Interesting question though, I'd be curious if there is any deeper research on precisely that difference. 

and are immediately contained in , but is not (because the node is standing between and ). and are immediately contained in , but is not immediately contained in , only mediately, because is in between, and so on. If you prefer kinship terminology, reword "X is contained in Y" as "X is a daughter or granddaughter or great grandaughter or great great ... granddaughter of Y", and "immediately contained" as "X is a daughter, but not a granddaughter or great great ... granddaughter of Y" (i.e. there are no other mothers in the family line between X and Y). Containedness is a relative term, i.e. you must always specify in which node something is (immediately) contained; w.r.t. to a whole syntax tree this notion can't apply, so the question "Which nodes are immediatly contained in a syntactic tree" doesn't really make sense if you don't say what nodes they are supposed to be immediately contained in. 

The process of deriving a verb from an adjective would be called deadjectival verbalisation, which is in turn an instance of derivaton. The resulting word could be called a deadjectival verb. Note that in the example you cite, the term that the verb is derived from could also be claimed to be the noun "adult", which would then be a denominal verbalisation. 

It should be noted that such syntactic information structure marking is to some degree also available in English (it-cleft constructions (It was a bread that she baked) for focus marking and topicalisation (The bread she didn't bake, but the cake) for topic marking), but it is less prominent than marking by accent, while other languages rarely use intonation for this kind of semantic/pragmatic information but frequently or even exclusively make use of particles or syntactic devices. If someone knows an example form a tonal language, please complement my post (or otherweise contradict it if it can't be applied to tonal languages so easily), this was just for a general explanation of what other means language can employ to differentiate semantic or pragmatic meaning if not by intonation. 

David Adger (Core Syntax, 2003) calls it (partial or total) feature specification. I would go with that one. 

I hope this answers your question. Again, I really think it would help to take a look at the definition of assimilation again and then just apply the feature checks step by steps, the difference between the examples becomes very clear then. P.S.: To quickly type phonetic symbols (since one unfortunately can't TeX in the editor here...), you can use IPA typeit and then simply copy-paste the text. 

Leaving the preposition at its initial position after the NP it belongs to has moved to the front makes the sentence ungrammatical: 

As @user6726 already said, you can not assign the phrase a POS, because "part of speech" refers to single words which as their native language isn't. 

Without going into too much detail about the logical spell-out, one way to formalize these modal operators is the assumption of so-called possible worlds, which are our metaphysical space: One can imagine a network of possible worlds, where each world is a very, very large situation, fully specified to every detail you could make an assertion about - there is our world of course, then there is one world which is almost identical to ours except for the fact that that bike standing out there is not red but black, then there is one world which would have been identical to ours except for the fact that Hitler never existed, leading to a completely different development of historical events, then there is one world which is completely different to ours w.r.t. the fact that not humans but giant ants have taken over world domination, ... - and as you can imagine, there are in theory infinetely many of such worlds, already due to the fact that our bike could stand one meter from the wall, 1.20 meters, 1.232323 meters, 1.23932545565463 meters, ... Our universe is a network of many of such worlds, out of which some can see each other, others can't. For example, if our universe consisted of worlds w1 to w10, we could have the case that w1 sees itself, w2 and w4, w2 also sees w1, w3 and w10 but not itself, w3 sees w1 and w2 (so we have a reachability circle of w1, w2 and w3), but nothing else, w4 sees w8 and w10, and so on. Note that this model does not make any claim about the actual existence of such parallel universes. It is really only there to capture the notions of possibility and necessity in somewhat more graspable terms. In this network now, "necessary p" means that from our standpoint (i.e. the "actual world"), in every world we can see, p is true. It might be that there are worlds in which it is not true, but these worlds are not reachable to us, so in our world, p is a necessity. For example "It is necessary that when you drop a pen, it falls down" - it might be that there is a world in which this is not the case, but at least this is in reach of our imagination. "possible p", on the other hand, means that there is at least one world of which p is true. For example "It is possible that this winter will be a cold one". In our network of worlds, we can imaginally reach a world in which the approaching winter is cold, so it is possible that p is true, but we might also be able to imagine worlds in which this is not so, thus p is not a necessity. Note that these "alternative worlds" can also include the actual world we live in, if our world is defined as being able to itself in the universe. It could be that p is true in none of our neighbouring worlds, but in our own one, and if the network states that our world can see itself, then p is possible in our world. Formally, where is the reachability relation between worlds, 

If you say you are familiar with logic and interested in philosophy, you might have made acquaintance with modal logic: 

Under this account, perfect is be considered a tense, rather than an aspect, because it has the function of locating an event on a timeline - more precisely, locating the event to be spanning the time between the points E and S/R. (Here, S and R coincide - however, this holds only true for the present perfect where the speech time is the same as the reference time (as in They have taken over); in past perfect (as in They had taken over), the reference time is before the speech time, and the event would extend only until R, not up to S). In contrast, perfective is considered an instance of aspect, indicating that the event is being viewed as a "bounded whole" (from an outside perspective), rather than as an ongoing event from an inside perfective (which would be called imperfective): 

If this List of cases on Wikipedia is complete, then there is no name (yet) for a case which expresses location far away from something. Probably there is just no language that would express this by case (but by use of pre- or postpositions instead); location near by something or movement away from something is a more frequent thing to say. You could abuse the movement cases (if so, most suitably I'd say ablative or elative), this would then correspond to what @bytebuster suggested, but I'm still not too happy with that, because those cases are used for motion and not for location, so it wouldn't reflect the meaning properly and would, as bytebuster said, possibly clash with other cases that express actual movement away from something. If it's only about terminology, why don't you just think of your own case name? I think "Distantive", "Remotative" or "Procultative" would sound not too bad ;) 

Yes, I know, ternary branching is an ugly thing to do, but I don't want to start blowing up the tree with little v or anything to make it nice and binary. And yes, I know, if you want to make THE univeral syntax theory you can include a lot more empty categories and stuff (like I or T or whatever you may call it, for which there is no evidence they need to be assumed to exist for German). But there is no satisfying univeral theory of syntax anyway so let's just keep things simple, I think it should be clear what it means. Update If we need to move the whole VP instead of just the V, in order to be able to analyse the sentence Dem Lehrer das Buch gegeben hat Hans, we would probably have someting like this: 

Yes, this is right, but I think you misinterpreted this rule. Applied to your example, is , is and is empty. On the RHS, needs to be the same as the on the left-hand-side, that is, , is again empty, and now is the sequence bK. This is okay; as can be any sequence of terminal or non-terminal symbols, it is okay for to go to . 

If you are asking for an orthographic -s/-es: there are many examples, e.g. miss, floss, fuss, kiss, ... If it's about a phonetic [(ɪ)s]/[(ɪ)z], there are even moe: e.g. rise, impose; sneeze, snooze, freeze, ... 

When translating the English sentence to French, this distinction is irrelevant: Since French doesn't lexically realize the difference between inclusive vs. exclusive or either, we don't need to make the distinction in the first place, as both sense will result in the same translation (ou). However, when translating English to Finnish, the distinction does become relevant: Depending on whether or is used in the exclusive or the inclusive sense, the translation will result in either vai or tai, the two words having a different meaning in Finnish. Thus, for English -- French, we only need the most adequate translation (which will be ou anyway) and can igonre the further difference between exclusive vs. inclusive or, which corresponds to semantic selection, while for English -- Finnish, we actually need the most adequate sense, so here a WSD is required.
