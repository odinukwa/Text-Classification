There is a product designed specifically for this use, the Cerevellum: a bike computer with a crash recorder, which hooks up to a rear-facing camera. It's not cheap, but it is designed to do exactly what you want. 

The question is asking for sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison. Clipless pedals did not emerge as an alternative to riding in street shoes with toe clips—they were an alternative to riding in traditional cycling cleats with toe clips. Old-school cycling cleats had a big chunk of plastic attached to the bottom (pictured below)—the cleat. The cleat had a horizontal groove that fit snugly over the backplate of a traditional rat-trap pedal; once you got your foot on the pedal and the cleat in place, you'd tighten your toe straps and be very effectively locked in. In the early days, the soles of cycling shoes were leather or wood, and you'd ride around without cleats until the backplate left a mark on the sole; you'd then nail or screw the cleat into place to align with the mark. Later, the soles had captive bolts inside them that let you reposition the cleat, so you'd ride with the cleat loose until you figured out what worked and then tighten it (aside: some early clipless-pedal cleats also had to be screwed directly into the sole). Compared to traditional cleats and toe clips, modern clipless pedals have a lot of advantages. Clipping in is easier. Clipping out is way easier (everyone who rode in toeclips and cleats had the experience of failing to clip out in time at a stop and falling over…good times). The absence of a toe strap is much more comfortable (in the early days of clipless pedals, shoe uppers would detach from the soles because the shoes weren't designed to contain the force of the upstroke, but that was remedied within a year). Clipless pedal systems can be designed for a certain amount of rotational float and different release tensions. Old-fashioned cleats would get a little float just from the groove wearing down. 

I've broken a spoke on a well-built wheel simply from hitting a bump in the road a little too hard. And on a generic wheel, I've seen that when one spoke breaks, the spokes at 90° intervals from it start breaking, even after I replace the first broken spoke. My guess is that this reflects a pattern of underlying stresses. So neither of your spoke breaks surprise me that much. Since this is a Rohloff hub, you shouldn't have super-high tension on just the drive side due to dishing, so we can rule out that frequent cause of spoke breakage. It might be fatigue. Jobst Brandt regarded fatigue failures as a consequence of failing to stress-relieve the spokes when the wheel was built. 

Remove tire. Apply lubricant around the edge of extender remnant to facilitate removal--something like WD40 should suffice. Attempt to pop out the extender remnant with your thumb. When that doesn't work, set the rim on two pieces of scrap wood with the valve opening between them; have a friend hold the rim in place while you tap on the extender remnant with a mallet. You may need something to drive it all the way out, like a large nail or a nailsetter. 

I've never heard of a problem with P-clips. They are the standard way to mount a rack when the bike doesn't have upper rack braze-ons. I don't see how the P-clips can slip. The rack you're using is solid, not hinged, so if you only mounted it to the fender eyelets, it could only rotate forward/backward around that point. As soon as you locate it with P-clips as well, there's nowhere for it to slip. It might be possible for the nuts and bolts you use to affix the P-clips to come loose. You can use nuts with nylock inserts, or just retighten them as needed. 

Because shifter/derailleur/gear compatibility is necessitated only by indexed shifting, and you currently don't have that, you could throw any short-cage derailleur on this and it would work (or long cage, whatever). If you want to get indexed shifting, then we're talking about something much more complicated. For starters, your rear triangle is almost certainly spaced 126 mm, but you'll have a hard time finding a hub for an indexed-shifting system that will fit that--they did exist, but the bike industry moved up to 130-mm spacing pretty quickly (indexed shifting came out around 84-85, and 130-mm hubs a few years later), so either you'll need to get lucky hunting old parts or you'll need to have the rear triangle cold-set to 130 mm (you could maybe jam a 130-mm hub in a 126-mm triangle--different people report different results). Once you've done that, you'll need to buy a new rear hub, new cassette, new derailleurs, new chain, and new shifters. And some 11-speed drivetrains will require that you get a new crank to work well, if you go that route. 

There's no such thing as a 6-speed cassette. Back in the day, we used freewheels. Indexed shifting was a new thing when this bike came out, and from the looks of it, this bike didn't have it. It has what I'm guessing are Campagnolo Triomphe or Veloce shift levers, which were not indexed. 

I hate to give yet another It Depends answer, but it does. In my experience, the shape of your face will determine the cycling goggles that work best for you. I've got a long nose and narrow face, and I wanted sunglasses that didn't admit any sun over the top edge. I wound up with a pair of Nikes (now discontinued, like every good thing Nike ever does), but only after a lot of looking. My wife's facial features are just the opposite of mine—she can't wear my sunglasses at all, and after much looking she wound up with a spendy pair of Adidas sunglasses. Interchangeable lenses sound nice in theory, although I never take advantage of that. Wrap-around lenses that cover your peripheral vision are good. Polycarbonate lenses (I think most quality cycling goggles have them these days) is important. If you spend any time at high speed (say, descending at 30+ mph), a close fit will prevent turbulence behind the lenses, which makes your eyes tear up. 

I've got a Campagnolo Chorus 2x9 drivetrain on my bike. Lately I've found that shifting to the big ring is very difficult: The only way to get it to shift at all is to make a simultaneous front and rear shift going little>big and big>little; I assume that this introduces slack into the chain to make the shift easier. This isn't always successful, and when it is, I wind up overshifting (which is easy enough to correct, happily). It hasn't always been like this. Not sure where to begin diagnosing the problem. 

The "neutral" position places the ball of your foot over the pedal spindle, which I assume is where you're at. Conventional wisdom has it that sprinters and high-cadence riders will want the cleat positioned a little forward of that, LSD riders a little aft of that. But as with most positioning questions, the right answer is "whatever works for you." 

Forks flex mainly at the lower head-tube bearing race (this is true even with traditional road forks that are curved to rake them), so increasing the diameter of the steerer tube at that point will stiffen it. With some bikes, you may actually want that flex, as it will dampen some vibration. With a suspended mountain bike, obviously this is unnecessary and probably makes the suspension dynamics harder to dial in. And increasing a tube's diameter is a better way to stiffen the tube than increasing its wall thickness. 

Derailleurs are built with the parallelogram on a slope that approximately follows the slope of the cassettes they're designed to work with, so that the jockey pulley will be correctly positioned relative to the current cog as the derailleur moves through its range. There is no derailleur that is designed for this kind of slope, which incidentally is very non-linear, with a 100% step followed by a 50% step. Using any extant derailleur to try to get the chain to move 11 > 22 and (to a lesser extent) 22 > 33 is going to be very rough indeed, and mostly you're going to be jamming the chain into the side of the adjacent gear, rather than engaging it with the teeth of the adjacent gear. Shifting ramps, mentioned elsewhere, are designed to assist with shifts. There are no gears ramped for this kind of scenario, and indeed, it would probably be impossible to ramp the gears for it. Hub gears already solve the problem of a small number of widely spaced gears. It's not clear what is to be gained by trying to force derailleur gears to do this too. As mentioned elsewhere, it's true that early press about cassettes & freehubs touted their potential for mix-and-match gearing, but also as mentioned elsewhere, it turns out that lower gears need to be on multi-gear carriers to avoid chewing up the freehub splines, which is how we wound up with riveted or CNCd setups. Companies can only throw so many resources at developing, manufacturing, and distributing cassette configurations, and are naturally going to gravitate toward the ones that people actually want, not the ones that people hypothetically want. This is not the only reason that freehubs were developed, btw: the main reason, as I recall, was to move the drive-side hub bearings farther outboard, to better support the axle. It also makes swapping gears a lot easier (removing a freewheel could take a lot of muscle).
