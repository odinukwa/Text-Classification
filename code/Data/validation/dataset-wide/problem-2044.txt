I don't recommend coming to him and telling him that it's been bugging you for a long time or that anyone else doesn't like it. Instead, on one particular occasion, say something like: 

I think you are misinterpreting the interviewer's motivations entirely, and understanding them is important to answering the question properly. There are two possible mindsets the interviewer might have: 

These nuances can't be covered by "I'm willing to travel a bit", so save the conversation for the interview. 

You are probably right about the reasons for your manager's behavior. But I guarantee if you go to her to discuss that aspect of herself (you respect men more than women) it will end badly, even if you're right and even if she knows this about herself, all the more so if you're not or she doesn't think you are. Let's reword your question to something like this: 

This idea of negotiating, and winners and losers, feels really odd within a company. But that is your culture and you are unlikely to change it. So, go to your manager or whoever it was that sent you to work out who will do what on this statistics reporting, and tell them something like this: 

The risk is that no-one will hire you afterwards. That's why you need to be good, and being good needs to matter. This is perhaps too extreme a thing to get two or three days off, but if you'd like several weeks to go away somewhere for the holidays, it might work. I can see your employer's point in not allowing time beyond the statutory days, if your partner is in a field where it's busier at that time, and competition for the time off could cause tensions among the staff. Perhaps asking for a "leave of absence" would also be a strategy. 

Make sure you include information in the note that is not in the emails. Do not write the note in advance and set out to deliver it. Go to their office or desk, and if they're not there, leave a note that says: 

Eventually he will learn that you can't stand whistling at all, or what level of it you can stand, and he may hear similar things from others and stop whistling at work at all. Some people whistle when they're relaxed and happy. It would be sad if he felt less happy at work because people were asking him not to whistle. But it would be sadder still if he came to realize that you had been seething about it or discussing it with others. Just react in the moment as many times as you need to, until it doesn't bother you any more. Or wear headphones. 

You might still get pushback. Tool time, where I pay people to install and configure tools, irritates me. A less technical boss might worry about viruses or whatever. Reassure them that you're using everything (and more) that the machine they provided you was using. And if it gets to the point where you would leave the job if they won't budge, tell them that - but you'd better mean it. 

No confusion that I might have done Applied Chemistry or something like that. I used the initials because I think more people actually recognize the abbreviated degrees, but of course you can spell them out - and since you like the wording of the formal name, go ahead and do that. Note that in my case, Chemical Engineering is the formal name of my department, not of a program within the department. I could have said Biomedical Engineering instead, which was the program, corresponding to your IT for Creative Industries. Or you could mention your program in the cover letter and connect it to the work you're applying for. 

You choose things that others would admire you for wanting, things you genuinely want, and things you believe the company you are interviewing with can offer. And you focus on those. You do not include the sentence 

With the added proviso that you can't just "become more like the others" because they differ from you in a way you can't change. Can I suggest something kind of "off the wall" that might work for this particular boss? You say you like her. Try asking her for advice. Like this: 

This provides a small reminder to those who may not recognize the name. In addition you may want to add a sentence to your cover letter something like: 

Make a list of your own that details what is great about you that is not great about a typical Bachelors grad. Put these bullets on your resume or in your cover letter. Practice answering interview questions in a way that proves them. In this way, you will gain a job that values these things: a job a typical Bachelors grad would not gain. 

Is there anything worse than being taken aside for A TALK by someone who has been saving up their grimaces and objections for days or weeks? With a speech about how, without exception, all your jokes fall flat and ruin the atmosphere in the group room? I never think this is the right way to go. Instead, I encourage you to put some time into some on-the-spot rejoinders that are polite and unequivocal. This is reasonably difficult, so work on it. Some examples from the top of my head that you will need to improve on: 

When the audience looks happy as can be, but you know a vital important concept is being skipped, write yourself a note. If, by the next break or the end of the presentation, it is still not covered, approach the presenter one-on-one: 

Good answers make you look good. Understanding that every workplace is different and that culture and workstyle are important, and being careful your complaints don't have a tone that lets the interviewer assume you are actually at fault 

Have you ever had even one intern before? I'm assuming you haven't, and that makes this a bad plan. Start with two (they can support each other and bounce ideas around) who are physically near you, in the same building. Managing 5 people is not a good first managing experience. Managing even ONE person who doesn't have a lot of work experience is harder than managing one person who kind of knows how work works, will ask for help when they need it, will let you know when they are all done and need more etc. And managing remote people is way harder than managing local people. (Why do we do it? Because sometimes great people are only available remote.) So you want to start with interns, who are harder to manager than experienced workers, start with 5, which is more work than 2, and then start with remote for no other reason than they "should" learn to work remotely (a difficult skill some people never master) on their first work experience? Scale it down. Bring two interns into your office and see what happens. 

I have a fairly technical Twitter stream. If I was to use a resume to apply for things (I don't) I would be sure to include it. If I forgot for some reason, and someone asked for it, I would provide it without hesitation, along with a rough estimate of my followers etc. But if your Twitter is non technical, full of pictures of beer, dirty jokes, swearing, strong political opinions, and nothing that would make an employer think "I want this person on my team!" then keep it to yourself and your friends. On a form, leave it blank. If they ask, just say "I don't have a technical Twitter." Similarly for Facebook. If you routinely share links to technical material, reviews of conferences you've attended and books you've read, and you don't share pictures of yourself getting drunk or the like, then you could include it, if not say "Facebook is only for close personal friends." Your LinkedIn of course should be entirely professional, that's the point of it. You might also consider your StackExchange activities to be entirely professional too, and might operate here under a handle rather than your real name, so providing your handle might be a good idea, or a link to your Careers profile. If you tell an interviewer, "I don't have a technical blog/Twitter/Facebook" they might push you to reveal it. But a form you're filling out to get an interview will not. So reveal only the profiles that make you look good technically. I believe in an interview it would take tremendous chutzpah for an interviewer to tell me "oh that's fine, I don't want to check your technical profile, I want to look you over personally." If they did, I think I would just go with the firm stare that lasts long enough to let them know they've done something they shouldn't, and then repeat "I don't have a technical Twitter" or whatever and sit quietly. It's hard for me to be sure, because the only Twitter I have is technical, the only blog I have is technical, and I have a "public figure" Facebook. But I have been asked overly prying questions before and I find that it works: just stare for a little too long and then either repeat your previous non-answer, or say something meta like "if you're trying to find out more about my internet presence, " and then provide a roughly equivalent piece of information. Back in the day women would be asked about plans for marriage and babies, and I would do the stare and then say "if you're curious about my long term career plans I'd be delighted to discuss that" and go on to say what I wanted to do (at work) over the next 5-10 years. You could take a similar approach to overly prying requests for internet profiles. And if you don't have any technical profile at all anywhere, consider getting one. It's free and easy and makes you look much more valuable.
