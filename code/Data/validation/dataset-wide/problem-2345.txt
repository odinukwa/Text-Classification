In English, a common greeting used would be "Tight Lines", more on exiting the area than entering, to wish others luck. Although not a literal translation, it is considered equivalent. 

Equal expressions would be "Leave no trace." and the sentiment of "pack it in, pack it out." Do not be needlessly invasive on the environment. If the place is pristine when you get there, it should be when you leave. 

In many places, the law requires it. A common access rule in many places is that public access is granted to flowing water, but only to the normal waterline. Access to the land above that water line is trespassing, requiring the fisherman to be in the water to access it. This is not always true, for instance some places prohibit being in the water to fish and some jurisdictions allow for also owning the river bottom which makes wading also trespassing without approved access. The primary reason though is as stated, for correct presentation to the fish holding water. Wading should be done however only when actually needed to correctly access the holding water as excessive traffic does do damage to the stream and habitat. 

I raised both domestic and wild breeds of geese and other water fowl for a number of years. Eating human foods such as bread are notoriously poor for birds, especially wild breeds including bird rescue work. They like it, but it is like allowing kids to have candy as a main course for dinner. Some of the issues it can cause are manifested in leg and feet problems. Without seeing further video or the bird, it actually walking and running around, I could not say with any certainty if this bird is effected. At first glance, it appears to be chattering as it is doing it, which I would interpret as just being a "happy dance", it claiming the treat and wanting more. Looking closer though, I would have some concern. The goose was stepping on its own feet and the feet were toed in. They can do this, and I have seen healthy birds do so, but it is not typical. This is far more common with birds with injuries or structural issues of the legs. The bird is not showing other visible signs that I would normally look for with nutritional caused deformities so I suspect it may be fine, but I would have loved to have seen it moving across the field to confirm that. If I were to actually observe the bird, other signs I would look for would be angel wing, structural bowing of the legs, flayed hips, over weight, none of which are apparent so the bird is likely fine with the exception of possible angel wing. The gif clip is way to short and single angle so I cannot tell on angel wing. The bird would also walk like this if its legs were pegged, such as fishing line between them, but no visible sign of that without much clearer angel and resolution. 

I have tested the 1443R multiple times from multiple roles and it has consistently resulted in water seepage through the fabric after having 200 pounds of weight on top of it (shelter + person). These testings were performed on wet ground, muddy ground, and wet grass. If you are wanting to have tyvek that will work in all weather conditions, best to go with the heavier weight fabric. However for most dry weather conditions the 1443R is an excellent weight-to-protection ground sheet. Obviously the smaller body and lighter weight hikers are going to have less pound pressure on top of the fabric and thus less likely to have water seepage through the fabric. All of my tests were with 200 pounds on top of the 1443R fabric, as a baseline for testing. The standard tyvek handled 300 pounds without seepage. So depending on the wetness of the ground you tend to encounter and your overall sleep weight, that should give you a good insight into which to go with. 

I think your basis for this question is a bit out of skew with the clause. The difference between truly top end Merino Wool and lesser quality wool is the micron (µm) being used. The really good quality stuff, say, Icebreaker, uses the highest quality micron which results in a warmer garment that is able to handle ‘peripheral temperature regulation - and therefore thermoregulation - better for most outdoor activities. If, however we address the subject question you are asking, than the answer to that, as explained above, is absolutely, "YES". It will be highly superior in regards to helping you stay warm in a broader range of temperatures and helping 'wick away moisture' from your body through the Merino next-to-skin base layer and into your other base layers. But there is sooo much more to this question. What are your other base layers? Do they have a high enough MVTR to take the moisture from the next-to-skin layer to the second layer, and to the third layer, and out to the soft shell layer if the conditions require you to wear one. If just one of these base layer garments is not doing its job, you are going to sweat out the sub-layer garments, at which point none of this matters. But, anyway, yes, the top name Merino wool outdoor garments that use the ultra high micron wool are far better than some no-name random garment off the shelf. 

Weight - Very light, small tents are event backpack-able. Price - Cheap enough to almost be disposable. Large tents are not dirt cheap but are still 1/2 the price of their canvas counterparts. 

I'm looking for some input to determine which type to camping tent I should purchase specifically for car camping. I really like canvas tents as many of their features are very appealing but I know they do have a number of drawbacks. Below is a summary of what I have found in my research. My Background I do not need this tent to be portable (i.e. carried long distances) as this is intended for week-long trips with the family when camping in a single location, most often (but not always) at developed campgrounds. My only constraint is with the packed size as I'm currently driving a small crossover SUV which doesn't quite have the carrying capacity of a pickup truck. The Comparison Canvas Tents Pros: 

Large - Lots of room internally with near vertical walls. Waterproof - Easily maintained waterproofing using a product such as Kiwi Camp Dry. Temperature - Cooler in summer and warmer in winter as compared to Nylon. Durable - If well maintained (not put away wet, will last decades). Repairable - Simple needle and tread can be used to make field repairs. 

My Use Case I'm leaning towards a Kodiak Canvas 9x12 cabin tent with a ground cloth and the attached screen porch option. If anyone has any hands on experience with one of these tents specifically, I'm interested in how it stands up against the aforementioned points. I elected for this specific model because the attached porch can optionally be setup or tied back to the main tent meaning that I could use it when no other screen rooms are available and we need a bug-free location for cooking and storing gear under a roof. The Real Questions 

I love bananas and can eat a half-dozen to a dozen a day while at home. While out on the trail I try to have one or two a day. I also enjoy taking with me peaches, grapes, prunes (very good for you on-trail) and such, like yourself. What I have always done is keep them in the middle part of my backpack. Above anything heavy that can squish them (food bag) and below things that compress well (thermals,quilt). Tend to keep them in a different food bag than my primary food bag, which just gets thrown all around and beat up a lot. For peaches, because they are so easily damaged, I will often take sliced peaches and store them in a plastic container (ziplock type). Some may complain about the extra few grams for the plastic container, but we all make conscious decisions on what is worth what. To me, fresh fruit is important. I have not heard of any long distance hikers (PCT/AT/CDT,etc) that have been fruitarian, but that would be interesting to see happen some day. I am (as of time of posting) close to 600 days without meat consumption and it has been an interesting change while out on the trail. Leaving behind all of the meat based dehydrated meals and soups I use to make. Anyway, I think the vast majority of fruit is not going to have issues "over a period of two days" as your question is posed. Most fruit, even in warmer conditions can be stored in the middle of your pack and not have any issues. Same method has storing hard cheese for the long haul. 

It is important to remember that acts of theft are often crimes of opportunity. Thieves like to take something not because they planned to steal it but because it was easy to take. The previous answer suggests some great ideas for truly secure methods but simply running a bicycle cable lock through the loop of a handle or through a hole and around an immovable object is often enough to thwart off a would-be thief. I often use this technique when on short trips when the kayak will be out of sight and it works well in remote locations where a thief is unlikely to be carrying the tools necessary to defeat a lock. Another tip that almost goes without saying is to simply not provide thieves with the opportunity. Simply don't take the kayak anywhere you don't need to. I generally avoid driving around town with my bikes/kayaks on my vehicle if I can. I like to do my shopping before a trip and then load the kayaks just before hitting the road. I know that they are much safer when locked in my garage then they will ever be sitting atop my vehicle, no matter what kind of cables and straps I attach them with. 

Not as durable - Waterproofing breaks down over time and seam leaks are difficult to repair. Small - Large tents are almost (but not always) dome tents to take advantage of the small/lightweight curved fiberglass poles. Temperature - Hot in summer and cold in winter. Slightly invalidated for summer as only "hot" when the sun is shining and I'm not in the tent anyways.
