The NPs ten miles and two thousand miles are adjuncts. We know that they are adjuncts in part because they can be omitted without changing the basic meaning of the sentences: 

The examples given in the question are not examples of resultative adjuncts. Resultative adjuncts give the result of an action, e.g. 

The floating quantifier prefers to immediately follow, rather than immediately precede, the intonationally weak auxiliary verb have. It can, in contrast, easily immediately precede the intonationally more prominent non-auxiliaries left and have to. Why the intonation pattern prefers to be the one way as opposed to the other is mysterious. What is clear, however, is that linear order is not really impacting the scope of epistemic and deontic modal verbs and adverbs in relation to each other. 

This acceptability contrast consitutes what is known as a movement paradox; it is originally due to Joan Bresnan, I think. If topicalization really involved syntactic movement, then both of these sentences should be acceptable. The fact that 8a is bad demonstrates that the topicalized clause in 8b cannot have originated in its "base" position shown in 8a. 

As Atamiri points out, it is the direct object in the first example and me is the indirect object in the second example. The traditional explanation is that the direct object is acted upon directly, and the indirect object is affected by the action more or less indirectly. But be aware that these traditional explanations do not always work. There are instances where it is difficult to view the one or the other object as indirect or direct, e.g. She taught him Spanish -- in this case, it is difficult to view him as "indirect", since the the "him" is being directly influenced by the teaching. 

Classic X-bar theory takes all syntactic structure to be binary branching, a controversial assumption. Data like that produced in the question demonstrate why it is a controversial assumption. The example sentences cannot be anaylized convincingly in terms of strict binarity of branching. But if one is striving to maintain strict binarity of branching, then the structural analysis of the first example sentence might be something like the following: 

In many languages that have a lot of head-final structures, e.g. Chinese and Japanese, relative clauses precede the nouns that the they modify. Thus when this sentence is translated into these languages, the translation should produce a much different order of elements in the clause. Using the English words, an ordering of elements closer to the following would result: 

There is an approach to the syntax of natural language that can be consistent with the type of networks that the question is asking about. In a dependency grammar (DG) ($URL$ words are nodes that are linked into a structure by dependencies. Syntactic structure in dependency grammars might be represented in the following way (the tree is taken from the article Grammatical relation in Wikipedia): :: The edges connecting the words in the tree are dependencies, and each of these dependencies bears a syntactic function that indicates how the entire subtree functions with repsect to the entirety. Most work in DG assumes tree structures like the one just shown. One prominent dependency grammar, however, assumes networks as opposed to trees. This DG is called Word Grammar ($URL$ it is the grammar framework developed by Richard Hudson. The difference between trees and networks is that in a network, a given word can have two or more heads, as opposed to just one head. The book you probably want to take a look at is this one: ::Language Networks: The New Word Grammar, Richard Hudson, 2007 You will find there a sophisticated system of syntax and grammar that may include the type of networks that you are looking for in natural language. 

Why adverbs ending in -ly cannot function as predicative expressions, but most all other word categories can, is mysterious to me. 

German has morphological case, but I am not aware that this fact has any influence at all on the distribution of content clauses (that's what I've encountered these clauses called, i.e. content clauses). Whether or not a given noun can take a declarative or interrogative content clause is an idiosyncratic trait of the noun; it is a lexical matter, i.e. part of the valency of the noun. Certainly semantic considerations play a role in determining valency traits, but my guess is that semantics will get you only so far. The second question receives a clear answer that is purely syntactic in nature (as opposed to lexico-semantic). that-clauses have a distribution that is more limited than embedded wh-clauses. In particular, wh-clauses can easily appear as the complement of a preposition, whereas that-clauses really cannot, e.g. 

These examples demonstrate that over in walk over is a preposition, and over in talk over is a particle, which means talk over is a phrasal verb. The pronoun diagnostic with further examples is used in the Wikipedia article on phrasal verbs here: $URL$ A related question concerns the phenomenon of shifting that occurs with phrasal verbs. What is it about the syntactic structure that allows shifting to occur with phrasal verbs? The relevant difference across the particle of phrasal verbs and standard prepositions is that the particle and the NP object are sister constituents in the structure, whereas when a preposition is present, the NP is the dependent of the preposition. In other words, the structure is flat with phrasal verbs, whereas it is more layered when the preposition is present. Shifting is discussed in Wikipedia here: $URL$ The article includes examples involving phrasal verbs. 

Unlike young, which is a transient state because we all get older, interesting is intrinsic and inalienable. The distinction between stage-level and individual-level predicates is discussed at the bottom of the article here: $URL$ The direct answer to the question is therefore as follows: predicative adjuncts modify the verb if one interprets modify to mean 'be syntactically dependent on', or they modify the subject or object if one interprets modify to mean 'assign a property to'. Note that typical attributive adjectives unify both of these meanings of modify, e.g. 

The preposition on, the subordinator after and the adverb soon are predicative expressions. Note that participles (present active and past passive) are predicative expressions too (in fact, they are the canonical type of predicatives), e.g. 

Preserving grammaticality and preserving meaning of the sentence are two different things. If one is interested in conveying meaning and not worried about grammaticality, all function words can be removed, whereas the content words must remain. Example: 

Concerning the first question, German behaves similar to English regarding the content clauses that nouns can and cannot take, e.g. 

No, the argument vs. adjunct distinction is essential for most theories of syntax, and there is no theory I am aware of that would view any part of the sentence Bill gave Jessica a gift as an adjunct. Many adjuncts can be identified using certain diagnostics. Take the adverb yesterday as an example: Bill did it yesterday. It can be separated off and put in a conjoined clause: Bill did it, and that happened yesterday. This is not possible with arguments: *Bill gave a gift, and that that happened Jessica, *Bill gave Jessica, and that happened a gift. Arguments are typically nouns (or noun phrases) as with Jessica and a gift, whereas adjuncts are typically adverbs or PPs. It is therefore quite certain that neither Jessica nor a gift in the original example can be viewed as an adjunct. In my view, the reason for confusion stems from the X-bar theoretic approach to sentence structure. If one is striving to be true to the X-bar theoretic approach, then one of the two structures shown in the question might indeed be the preferred analysis. The problem with both of those trees, however, is that they are not confirmed by diagnostics for constituent structure. Most tests for constituent structure (topicalization, clefting, pseudoclefting, proform substitution, and answer fragments) identify Jessica and a gift as constituents, but they fail to identify gave Jessica as a constituent. According to the two trees, gave Jessica should be identifiable as a constituent. Again in my view, a much more plausible account of the sentence ejects the X-bar analysis and allows n-ary branching, i.e. it allows relatively flat structures. On such an analysis, the VP is flat; it views Jessica and a gift as sister constituents. Such an analysis is consistent with the results of the named tests for constituent structure. 

The adjectives in question do indeed behave in a unique way. They are dependents of the verb, but they are predications over the subject (or object), e.g 

These sentences contain two predicates each time, 'say' and 'hungry'. The primary predicate is 'say' and the secondary predicate is 'hungry'. The primary predicate 'say' is such that it blocks its secondary predicate from bearing presupposition. Whether or not Tom really was hungry or not is unknown, but rather what is known is merely that Tom did or did not claim he was hungry. The absence/presence of the negation has no impact on this state of affairs. Other predicates, in contrast, allow their secondary predicates to bear presupposition, e.g. 

Grammatical dependencies between empty theta heads θ and their predicate Xs (head-complement dependencies) and Thematic dependencies between empty theta heads θ and their specificiers (specifier-head dependencies), these specifiers being what one traditionally understands to be the arguments of the predicate Xs. 

My preferred analysis of the forms mine/yours/his/hers/ours/theirs is that they are possessive pronouns, whereas the forms my/your/his/her/our/their are possessive determiners. A determiner is an immediate dependent of a noun, whereas a pronoun is an immediate dependent of a verb or a preposition. In other words, one looks to cooccurence patterns as the basis for the classification. Note that I am assuming an NP-analysis of noun phrases, not a DP-analysis. The analysis of N-ellipsis bears on this matter. One prominent approach to N-ellipsis is that ellipsis has indeed occurred. At least the noun has been elided, e.g. 

It is not a conincidence. There are concrete observable criteria that can be acknowledged for predicting when the division between the two pronoun classes might occur: loss of case and cooccurrence with a finite verb. The phenomenon exists in both French and English because these two languages satisfy the two criteria mentioned (mainly loss of case). Whether the phenomenon is borrowed from French into English is unclear, but influence does seem likely. That the phenomenon is left over from Proto-Indo-European is doubtful, since Indo-European languages with rich case systems do not have the division. That the phenomenon is a linguistic universal (one set of pronouns for names of people and one set of pronouns in special contexts) is unlikely, since languages with rich case systems do not have it. 

In this example, the personal pronoun he is not referring directly to a specific entity, which means it is not definite; it is, rather, being used as an indefinite pronoun; it means 'the one, anyone', e.g. Anyone who studies a lot gets a good grade. 

The term part of speech refers to the traditional word categories. Usually, somewhere between eight to twelve basic parts of speech are posited, e.g. noun, verb, adjective, adverb, adposition (preposition, postposition, circumposition), coordinate conjunction, subordinate conjunction, interjection, ... The term syntactic type is simply vague. It could refer to anything that is assumed in the domain of syntax. It could refer to words, phrases, clauses, other specific word combinations. I have no clear associations with what is meant when I see syntactic type out of context. 

There are numerous types of ellipsis that are acknowledged by linguistics. Here are some examples of the various types: 

While seem is indeed a raising verb, that does not change the fact that the subject is generally positioned as an immediate dependent of the finite verb in many modern DGs. The position of John immediately in front of the seemed and the fact that John agrees with seemed (compare: *They seems...) are strong indicators that John is an immediate dependent of seemed. If one chooses a DG approach that acknowledges both deep and surface syntax, then one could view John as a dependent of fall below the surface (i.e. in deep syntax). 

The coordinated strings marked by the brackets in these cases do not qualify as any recognizable unit of syntax in most theories, i.e. they are not VPs or NPs or ... To deal with such data, many theories have to introduce additional machinery, for instance they assume ellipsis in terms of conjunction reduction or right node raising). Another problem for phrase structure rules is associated with conjuncts that are distinct in syntactic category as pointed out by Thomas Gross, e.g. 

The adjectives angry, drunk, and upset are predicative adjectives; they follow the nominal to which they assign a property. Finally, some languages encode the distinction between attributive and predicative adjectives morphologically. In German, for instance, attributive adjectives bear suffixal endings that show gender, number, and case, whereas predicative adjectives lack these endings entirely, e.g. 

These sentences contain the constituents disgusted with the situation, having no choice, and being required to work on Wikipedia articles, whereby these constituents can be interpreted as the predicates of clauses. The subjects of these clauses are implied, i.e. they are easily understood from the context. For sentence a, "he" is the one who was disgusted with the situation; for sentence b, "she" is the one who has no choice; and for sentence c, "the students" are the ones who are required to work on Wikipedia articles. Like most languages, English has mechanisms in place that allow it to express predicates without also having to state the subjects, since the subject is easily retrieved from the context. If one desires a formal linguistic concept for the issue at hand, it is control. The theory of control explores when the subject of a predicate has to be expressed overtly and when it can be implied from the context. In any case, one is dealing with clauses because the subject is present (either overtly or covertly). Finally, the notion that a subordinate clause must be introduced by a subordinator (= subordinate conjunction) is wrong. While it is true that many subordinate clauses are indeed introduced by a subordinator, there are types of subordinate clauses that are not introduced by a word that is taken to be a subordinator, e.g. relative clauses and indirect questions. 

To come more directly to the question, gapping and small clauses are distinct phenomena of syntax. Gapping is widely acknowledged as a type of ellipsis, whereas small clauses are not generally taken to involve ellipsis. So the notion that gapping results in a small clause is not accurate. Ellipsis, gapping, and small clauses are discussed in Wikipedia. 

The question of which verb is the root is largely settled among theoreticians, contrary to what lemontheme writes. The root is the finite verb, not the/a non-finite verb. This is the stance adopted by a large majority of established dependency grammars. Richard Hudson in his Word Grammar framework takes the finite verb as the root. Igor Mel'cuk in his Meanining-Text framework takes the finite verb as the root. The German schools (Eroms, Heringer, Gross, Engel, Lobin, etc.) take the finite verb as the root. Lemontheme is correct only insofar as some computational linguists doing dependency grammar are unsure about the root. These computational linguists are, however, largely ignoring the large body of work that has accummulated over the decades in theoretical circles. Bliss in ignorance. There are numerous empirical considerations that identify the finite verb as the root. The finite verb is the main locus of much functional information (person, number, tense, mood, voice). Subject-verb agreement obtains with the finite verb, not with the/a non-finite verb. In English, the finite verb is the left-most verb in the verb chain, making verb chains head-initial. In Japanese, the finite verb is the right-most verb in the verb chain, making verb chains head-final. There are thus broad typological considerations supporting the finite verb as the root. Diagnostics for constituents of the sort that are widely employed in syntax, linguistics, and grammar textbooks support the finite verb as the root. This point will now be demonstrated here. Consider the following sentence:
