This is not an answer. It's an interesting observation, and it demonstrates how the boundaries between demonstratives, definite articles and indefinite articles are quite fluid. Through history, then, you might observe how words can cross these boundaries. My former teacher referred to this usage of "this" to show that it isn't that strange that the old demonstrative "this" became the Old Irish definite article "the". Just think about utterances such as "And then I was walking down this street, and then I saw this guy, and he had these weird clothes on, and then he fell and hit this rock, and then this woman came up ..." etc. 

According to some, yes. I was in the class provided in the link. The example I remember the most was this language somewhere in eastern Russia where all the nouns came from one language and all the verbs from the other (the two languages being a native language and Russian). 

If you look at Altaic languages (e.g., Korean, Japanese, etc.) you will find that they have highly developed semantic features that may possibly be applied. In Korean you can find features such as +/- action, +/- abstract, +/- count, etc. The list goes on in Altaic languages, so these may be a good place to look when considering different types of semantic features. In English, while we do not necessarily have as overt of a semantic feature bundle system, it is not entirely unheard of in the language. Consider the three transitive verbs 'sit' (e.g., The clock sits on the desk), 'lie' (e.g, The watch lies on the desk), 'stand'(e.g., The vase stands on the desk). The types of items which can 'sit' might be classified as -animate, +compact (or some designation of the sort). Consider bowls, telephones, etc. The types of items which can 'lie' might be classified as -animate, + flat. Consider sheets of paper, rulers, shirts, etc.. The types of items which can 'stand' might be classified as -animate, +tall. Consider chairs, tables, lamps, etc. The idea is that we refer semantically interpret these items in the same manner that we interpret phonological features, which is to say we do it more or less unconsciously. 

The consensus is that Grimm's law occurs before Verner's law. You will in the field of Indo-European linguistics always find someone who claims the opposite of what the consensus says. So it's important to know what the consensus is. Here's an argument in favor of the traditional approach: Verner's law turns voiceless fricatives into voiced fricatives. You can read more about that in my 2011 paper "The phonetics and phonologization of Verner’s law". But, Verner's law also targets Proto-Indo-European */k/. How is that possible? Well, Grimm's law turns Proto-Indo-European */k/ into a voiceless fricative */χ/, so if we order Grimm's law before Verner's law, then the outcome follows: */k/ > */χ/ > */ɣ/. You can read more about that in my 2009 paper "The development of voiced labiovelars in Germanic". My papers are here: $URL$ I would like to know how those people who order these laws differently will explain these facts. 

I believe that Principles and Parameters theory is not necessarily the manner in which "our" language is constructed. Rather, it is a convenient and elegant way with which to observe cross-linguistic differences and deal with certain issues brought on by interference in the acquisition of a second language. Based on Chomsky's Universal Grammar, parameters in language are often seen as binary switches in the language center of the mind, which may be convenient, but it does not fully encompass the true nature of languages, in my opinion (since you seem to be asking for opinion). For example, while it may be acceptable to say that most languages are SVO (e.g., English) or SOV (e.g., Japanese) word order and a language parameter may be set to one or the other, this binary excludes the other four word order attestations. Also, to say that a language's grammar is constructed based on these theories is much like putting the horse before the cart. That is, the parameter cannot inform the grammar because it is the language itself which informs the parameter; you theoretically set grammatical parameters to the language you acquire natively. Additionally, when we consider certain creolized languages (such as Louisiana French Creole (LFC)), principles and parameters may be even less clearly defined. Consider copula-deletion in LFC, where whether or not the AUX is used is no based on a parameter of any kind because in most cases the speaker can choose to delete or NOT delete the copula on a whim.

And what is the definition of a syllable? Taking dictionary.com as an example, syllable is defined as "an uninterrupted segment of speech consisting of a vowel [...] (with or without preceding or following consonant sounds)". I'm sure you can see where this is going. 

This is an old problem within comparative Germanic linguistics. The main ideas out there have been: (1) Only Gothic has both þl- and fl-. The other Germanic languages must therefore have undergone a sound change þl- > fl-. (2) Gothic underwent a sound change fl- > þl-. The Gothic words with fl- are newer loanwords (or other ad hoc solutions). (3) Gothic underwent a conditional sound change fl- > þl-, but it's not clear what the condition was. It's not clear to me whether there is any consensus in the field here, to the extent that this topic has been sufficiently treated to allow a consensus to arise at all. 

First, mixed languages, pidgins, and creoles are all different things, so you should beware using the term "mixed language" as a synonym for pidgin or creole. The overarching term that would include all three of these terms and others is contact language. Now, the following from Baker and Mous (1994, p. 5) attempts to define a mixed language: "A very rough approximation is that a mixed language has its lexicon and grammar from different sources. On the basis of the lexicon one would classify such languages as belonging to one language family and on the basis of morphology, syntax, and general grammatical characteristics one would classify them as belonging to another language family." The above shows that mixed languages are a melange, but there is reference to parent languages, and it does not include those things which separate a creole from a mixed language. One such difference, according to Mark Seeba, is that mixed languages, unlike creoles, tend to retain the morphological complexity of their input languages (1997). From here on I discuss the main question at hand: do contact languages have families? The short answer is that it depends. Research can be used to say yes or no. The long answer follows below. I suppose that daughter languages are typically shown as being born from one parent language, as we might find with English stemming from a Germanic lineage, but even this seems overly simplistic when we consider arguments like Bailey and Maroldt's (1977) Middle English creole hypothesis, which argues that Middle English was a creole born from language contact (primarily Old English and Norman French, but with evident tertiary contact considered key to pidginisation/creolisation). Because creoles tend to be the result of contact between at least three languages (although we often only refer to the superstrate and substrate), the act of genealogical tracing becomes more difficult but not impossible or unheard of. For example, I have personally seen language genealogy trees linking Gullah and Black English to a parent African language (i.e., West African Pidgin English) based on various lexical and syntactic rules. I cannot cite the direct source at the moment, but I have seen it used in at least one book in actual tree form, derived into the same structure in my Sociolinguistics seminar, and often explained in expanded form by linguists like John Rickford, Russel Rickford, and Lisa Green. I have read similar accounts for Louisiana French Creole by Thomas Klingler and others. One could posit a very strong argument for the parentage of any given creole simply through research and writing. Personally, I am on the side that would consider a creole to be the daughter of multiple languages with roots tied to both lineages. For more information and a wonderful, easy read about pidgins, creoles, and other contact languages, refer to Mark Sebba's, "Contact Languages: Pidgins and Creoles." 

The answer is no. A palatalized /g/ is a different phoneme from a labialized /g/, and there is no obvious way that they are connected. 

In /l/, there's a closure between the sagittal middle of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. Air is released along the sides of the tongue. In /s/, more or less the opposite happens. The sides of the tongue are raised, and a groove is formed along the sagittal middle. If you move the tongue from an /l/ towards an /s/, and you don't time the formation of the groove correctly, you'll form a complete closure between the tongue blade and the roof of the mouth. The sound emerging from that configuration is a /t/. In short, /t/ is formed as a transition from /l/ to /s/ when the different tongue configurations are not perfectly synced. As a side note, the reverse happens in Icelandic, where the sequence sl- is pronounced /stl-/. 

The examples won't match up exactly cross-linguistically, but the general idea is there. According to Fagyal et al. (2006), "The combination of the auxiliary verb...and the past participle [in French] might have originally retained the possessive meaning of 'to have' [from Latin], so that epistolas scriptas habeo might have meant 'I have written some letter' or 'I have some letters that were written'." It's possible that latin roots referring to possesives when using 'have' may be attributing to the need in French for a secondary PAST AUX (« être ») for statives. 

DR & MRS VANDERTRAMP are verbs that deal with state, movement, and direction. They are also used intransitively (without a direct object; e.g., Je suis sorti., 'I went out.'). You can see the difference notably when you consider that if some of these same verbs are used transitively or ditransitively, then « être » is no longer the copula. Instead, those verbs then take « avoir » as their copula (e.g., J'ai sorti les poubelles, 'I took out the trash.'). Consider the following: 

It is the past tense of the conditional mood (kondicionál minulý, podmiňovací způsob minulý). A short official and authoritative description in Czech can be found at $URL$ Note you should use genitive očí, not nominative oči. 

Harry would have liked to have at least four extra pairs of eyes. See also: James D. Naughton (2006) Czech: An Essential Grammar: 

The question explicitly asks for the difference with m.č. (minulý čas), so: The past tense (minulý čas, složené préteritum (compound preterite), developed from the Old Czech perfect tense) is the only non-archaic past tense in Czech: 

It is not that archaic as some claim. See $URL$ (in Czech). I cite and translate: "We can therefore conclude that the thing is not that the past conditional would be disappearing from Czech; but it is used only when the past is not signified by other means or if the past is not understood from context. 

There's no need to invoke ordered rules in order to explain the vowel distinction between 'writer' and 'rider'. In both cases, the vowel is simply the same as in the non-derived forms 'write' and 'ride', where the distinction between /t/ and /d/ is still present, and it's this distinction between /t/ and /d/ that's responsible for the difference in the articulation of the /ai/ diphthong. The reason you can't detect any difference between the vowels in 'matter' and 'madder' is that these two words aren't derived from base forms where a /t/ and /d/ is present. You're actually being tricked by knowing their spelling. If you didn't, you wouldn't have any idea that one was spelled with 't' and the other with 'd', since these consonants are in fact always pronounced the same (as a flapped [ɾ]). This explains the lack of vowel differences in 'liter' vs. 'leader'. The word 'liter' isn't derived from a base with 't'. The word has a flap [ɾ], which is voiced, and vowels are lengthened before voiced consonants. Since both 'liter' and 'leader' (derived from 'lead') have the vowel before a voiced consonant, their vowels are the same. So what about 'sighter' vs 'cider'? Here you would expect the diphthong in 'cider' to behave like it does before other voiced consonants, since it has a voiced [ɾ]. As musicallinguist says in his answer, the 'Canadian raising' phenomenon typically affects /ai/ before voiceless consonants, but it actually affects some words where /ai/ is before voiced consonants as well. One of the words musicallinguist mentions that he has Canadian raising in is indeed 'cider', and I can verify that (not as a native speaker, but I have definitely heard people pronounce it like that). Other words where you have an 'unexpected' raised /ai/ include words like 'tiger'. I don't know if anyone has a good explanation for these exceptions. In 'slighter' vs. 'slider', you find a contrast in the vowels because they behave "normally", i.e. just like 'writer' vs. 'rider' (since they're derived from 'slight' and 'slide').
