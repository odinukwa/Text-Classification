The conceptual problem is that the half-light radius is the radius of a circle enclosing half the total light, assuming that the object is circular with a radial intensity profile equal to the Sersic function. So you need to integrate over circular rings, each of which has an area of $2 \pi r \, dr$ and an intensity (or surface brightness) of $S(r)$: $$L(< R) = \int_{0}^{R} 2 \pi r \, S(r) \, dr$$ where $S(r)$ is the Sersic function evaluated at radius $r$. Instead, you're just doing the integral of a line of fixed width: $$\int_{0}^{R} S(r) \, dr$$ In Python terms, the (pre-calculated) function you integrate should be 

From a quick skim of the paper, it appears they using data from a previous paper by Smartt et al. (2009). That paper compiled a sample of observed supernovae (SNe) for which there are good images of the parent galaxies taken before the actual SNe. In some cases, Smartt et al. found plausible progenitor stars for the SNe; those are the "detections". Cases where they couldn't find a plausible progenitor on pre-SN images are the "non-detections". (The authors of the paper you are talking about appear to be suggesting that Smartt et al. underestimated the masses of progenitor stars because they failed to account for extra local dust extinction from the more massive red supergiant stars.) 

What is it? An IMF, $\Phi(m)$, is defined such as $\Phi(m){\rm d}m$ gives the fractions of stars with a mass between $m - {\rm d}m/2$ and $m + {\rm d}m/2$, and with a normalized distribution $$\int_{m_{\rm min}}^{m_{\rm max}}m\Phi(m){\rm d}m = 1\ M_{\odot}.$$ Note that these boundaries ($m_{\rm min}$ and $m_{\rm max}$) are ill-defined, but typically of the order of 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 100 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. IMFs The various IMF used are the following, with their main characteristics: 

in orbit around the Sun with a sufficient mass so that self-gravity overcome rigid body forces (that assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium) has cleared its neighbourhood. 

More dirty details: There is an excellent talk by Scott Tremaine, given at ESO last year you could watch online. 

It is still an open question, even though it is clear that it is linked to the magnetic field of the Sun. The following hypothesis are the following: 

Origin of Earth rotation There are two main phenomena that explain Earth rotation. First one is linked to the history of the solar system: there is angular momentum in the interstellar medium (ISM), so the collapsing cloud that formed our solar system had an initial angular momentum (rotation of the galaxy and turbulence in the ISM are typically a good candidate for that; see for example Mac Low & Klessen 2004). By conservation of the latter, particles in the collapsing cloud accelerate (the norm of the angular momentum $I$ is $mrv$, with $m$ the mass of the system, $r$ the radius and $v$ the velocity; as the cloud contracts, $r$ decreases and then $v$ has to increase) and due to centrifugal force, a disk will tend to form. By conservation of the angular momentum in the protoplanetary disk, you will also tend to form bodies that rotates. The second phenomena is linked to the formation history of the Earth. Simply put, Earth formation history is due to collisions of planetesimals (let say they are big chunks of rock, formed by a collision history of smaller chunks of rock, formed by...); these planetesimals are orbiting the forming star in the protoplanetary disk, their rotation being linked to the disk formation history (see above). When planetesimals collide, two things can basically happen: either the collision is perfectly central (meaning that the momentum of one of the two colliding objects is pointed toward the center of mass of the second object) and there is no transfer of angular momentum, either the collision is lateral and there is a transfer of angular momentum. Depending on the configuration, you can either transfer momentum that will make the other body rotating on way or the other. That being said, you can then object that there should be a equirepartition of collisions pushing the proto-Earth to rotate in both directions. Which is true, but external planetesimals are rotating faster than internal ones. Therefore, from the proto-Earth perspective (meaning, in a physical sense, in its reference frame), internal planetesimals are seen as coming backward, from front, and external planetesimals are seen as coming forward, from behind. Long story short, there are both transfering momentum in the same "direction", forcing the proto-Earth to rotate in the same direction as the rotation of the protoplanetary disk (see for example Artem'ev & Radzievskii 1965). Rotation around the Sun This one's easy: gravity. The Earth is constantly falling towards the Sun because of gravity, and the centripetal acceleration counteracts perfectly gravity, mainting the Earth on its orbit. 

The primary, traditional classification for galaxies in the local universe is based on "morphology" -- in other words, on their optically visible shape; this goes back to the Hubble Sequence. I'll list the main categories and the defining shape, and then some other characteristics which are not part of the main criteria. Elliptical Galaxies: These are circular or elliptical in projected shape (ellipsoidal or triaxial in 3D shape), with no visible disk and very little gas or dust, and little or no evidence for young stars. The stars are almost all old, and tend to orbit in random directions. Very luminous/massive ellipticals tend to have centrally concentrated radial profiles in the stellar density (now usually described using Sersic profiles with high values of the index $n$); faint, low-mass "dwarf ellipticals" have more exponential stellar profiles. S0 (or Lenticular) Galaxies: These have a prominent disk of stars, but one which lacks visible spiral arms and has little or no gas or dust, and little or no evidence for young stars. The disk may, however, have one (or sometimes two) stellar bars, and sometimes rings as well. The stars are mostly old and almost all orbit in the same direction within the disk, but the orbits may be somewhat elliptical rather than circular. They almost always have a prominent "bulge" of stars dominating the middle of the galaxy; the bulge may be a very centrally concentrated part of the disk, the vertically thickened part of a stellar bar, or a round collection of old stars with mostly random orbits (somewhat like a small elliptical galaxy) -- or a combination of all three. Spiral Galaxies: These have a prominent disk of stars, gas and dust; the disk has spiral arms in it (hence the name). The subclassifications within this category (e.g., Sa vs Sb vs Sc vs Sd) are based on a combination of three factors: the relative prominence of a central bulge (if any); how tightly or loosely wound the spiral arms appear to be; and the degree to which the spiral arms are smooth versus being broken up into fragments and stellar clusters. The stars and gas almost all rotate in the same direction, with orbits that are relatively circular. They are almost always a mix of young and old stars, with new stars being formed in the disk. They may have a bulge in the center, but some do not; the bulges may be as diverse and complicated as those in S0 galaxies. Irregular Galaxies: As the name suggests, these are more raggedy, lopsided, and generally "shapeless". They are usually rich in gas, and are almost always lower in mass than the other types; they are, like spirals, often forming stars at the present time. There are a number of different kind of dwarf (= faint, low-mass) galaxies which may or may not fall neatly into the above categories. For example, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are very faint and low-mass; in terms of structure, stellar orbits, and the absence of gas or current star formation, they resemble ellipticals, but are very diffuse rather than centrally concentrated. Recent and still somewhat mysterious discoveries include "ultracompact dwarf" (UCD) galaxies and "ultradiffuse galaxies". 

Such objects are surrounded by an accretion disk, that is a disk of gas, the gas being accreted onto the central object. However, at this stage of its life, the accretion disk around the black hole of a binary system like GRS-1915+105 is strongly depleted. Therefore, the accretion rate is not sufficient to support a coutinuous burst. Matter fills the outer disk until a critical density is reached, that triggered an outburst. Mass from the companion star is lost by a Roche lobe overflow mechanism. References: 

What you could think at first, regarding the orientation of any planetary system, is that it should be roughly in the plane of the galaxy, simply by angular momentum conservation. But, when you take a look at observations, you see that protoplanetary disks orientation is not what you would expect, with no preferential orientation (protoplanetary disks are embryo of planetary systems, that makes them interesting). In the following figure, the orientation corresponds to the inclination between the line of sight and the rotation axis of the disk. 

Exoplanets: As you see in the resolution B5, this definition is specified for "Planet in the Solar System". It is mainly because it does not really make sense now that it is already challenging to observe planets, so the distinction between a planet and a dwarf planet is not yet crucial for exoplanets. So the official definition of an exoplanet by IAU makes mainly a difference between a planet and a brown dwarf. However, I guess the IAU definition of a planet should be kept for the other planetary systems if we are able to detect objects such as dwarf planets. 

That should give you a list of galaxy clusters within the specified radius of your galaxy which are at a similar redshift. Note that the same cluster may come up multiple times under different names (i.e., from different cluster catalogs), but it should be clear from the coordinates and the redshifts which are the same clusters. Now the question is whether your galaxy is plausibly a member of a given candidate cluster or not. Ideally you should find some measurement of each cluster's velocity dispersion $\sigma$; if the galaxy's redshift isn't within $\pm 3 \sigma$ of the cluster's redshift $V_{\rm cluster}$, then you can ignore that cluster, since it's very unlikely that a galaxy with that relative velocity with respect to the cluster is actually gravitationally bound to the cluster. You can't really do better than a probabilistic assessment: roughly how likely it is that the galaxy is a member of a given cluster. Galaxies which are members of a cluster are more likely to be close to the center (on the sky); member galaxies closer to the center can have a higher range of relative velocities, while member galaxies further away should have velocities closer to the cluster redshift. A quick example: Is NGC 4889 ($V_{\rm gal} = 6495$ km/s) a member of a cluster? At its redshift, 1 Mpc = 33 arc minutes; if we search on NED for galaxy clusters within 33 arcmin of NGC 4889 with redshift limits of 4500-8500 km/s, we get 6 results, 4 of which are just the Coma Cluster in different catalogs, with $V_{\rm cluster} \sim 6900$ km/s. Since the various distances ("Separ. arcmin") translate to $\sim$ 100-300 kpc from the cluster center, and since the Coma cluster has a velocity dispersion of $\sim$ 1000 km/s and the difference between NGC 4889 and the cluster is only $\sim$ 400 km/s, it's a very good bet that this galaxy is a member of the Coma Cluster. (It's actually one of the two cD galaxies in the cluster center.) 

Why there is this distribution of orientation? The angular momentum scenario is nice but far to simple: star formation occurs in gas clouds in the interstellar medium, and these clouds are known to be turbulent (Larson, 1981). Turbulence simply disrupts the gas, and is dominent over the global angular momentum of the cloud. Actually, you can even test that with numerical simulations of star formation: put an initial angular momentum consistent with observations, and some turbulence (subsonic or slightly supersonic, also in accordance to observations), and you will get a misalignement of the rotation axis, due to turbulence. 

That's for the big projects (with a strong European bias, sorry folks I know better what's done on this side of the ocean). You can add to that all the missions to study exoplanets (like Kepler), missions to study our solar system planets (Cassini, Huygens, Messenger, Juno, all the Mars missions etc.), plus all the other facilities around the world to study anything and everything, from stellar dynamic to planet's composition. The main problem is always to understand how such structure (from the large scale structures in the Universe to small scale structures in the galaxy), object (from galaxies to satellites), phenomenon occurs, forms, appears. To understand what are the dominant physical processes at play. Astronomy is still craving for data; the more data you have, the better your statistic will be, and hopefully the better your understanding will also be. 

Determine what angular radius $R$ corresponds to 1 or 2 megaparsecs at the redshift of your galaxy (e.g., using Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator) Do a search in NED for Galaxy Clusters within R of the coordinates of your galaxy. If your galaxy has a name, you can skip the coordinate lookup and use the "Near name" search form; if you only have coordinates, there's a "Near position" search form. A. Put the estimated angular radius $R$ (converted to arc minutes) in the "Search Radius" box; B. Set the "Selection in Redshift" form to "Between" and give it lower and upper limits of $V_{\rm gal} - 2000$ and $V_{\rm gal} + 2000$ in km/s, where $V_{\rm gal}$ is the redshift (in km/s) of your galaxy; C. Under "Selection by Object Type", select "Galaxy Clusters" in the "Classified Extragalactic Objects" list. 

The "Schechter-like" Equation 3 in that paper is meant to give the value of black-hole mass density in units of "number of black holes of a particular mass per volume per log black hole mass", with the volume in units of megaparsecs and the "log black hole mass" in units of 0.1 log solar-mass units -- i.e., 0.1 dex. Since the integral involves multiplying by $d \log M_{\rm BH}$, you are multiplying $(\log M_{\rm BH})^{-1}$ by $\log M_{\rm BH}$, and thus the "dex" units do indeed cancel out. As for the exact value, you're going to have trouble reproducing that. First of all, the value from the text that you quoted ("5.06") is the result when they integrate over all BH masses, not just the $10^6$ to $10^{10}$ limits in Equation 4. From their Table 3, the relevant comparison value would be 4.9 if you're just doing the integration in Equation 4. Second, the values they quote in Table 3 (and in the text for the full integration) are apparently not straightforward computations from their Equation 4 (or from the full integral). They go through a complicated exercise of computing this value 10001 times, each time tweaking the input coefficients of Equation 1, then applying some more using random Gaussian deviations, so they end up with a distribution of BH density values, not just a single one. They say 

In Farihi et al. (2013) (it's a Science paper, unfortunately I'm not sure its content is freely accessible), they actually measured metal excess in the white dwarf GD 61 (for an astronomer, everything that is nor hydrogen neither helium is a metal). Due to high surface gravity in white dwarfs, any heavy element should sink rapidely in its atmosphere; therefore, they infer that, if you find traces of metals, it means that it comes from accreted material, "polluting" its atmosphere. So if you find oxygen in a white dwarf spectrum, you know that it has to come from somewhere else, and if the white dwarf has a circumstellar disk, it has to come from planetesimals that are accreted from the disk. Now, what they did was to measure abundances (or upper limit for their abundance) for a bunch of chemical elements (O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe) and carbon. Then, they could infer different things to determine the total oxygen budget: 

It depends on the kind of star you want to make. Basically, what you really need is hydrodgen; as soon as enough hydrodgen is gathered somewhere and collapse, you end up with a star. But, if you just have hydrodgen, you will get a very massive star, and with a history different than the stars observed in the local Universe. Why so? 

As Rob Jeffries suggested, in the WFPC2 observations the progenitor star fell located on one of the wide-field ("WF") chips of WFPC2. (I verified this by downloading one of the preview images from the Mukulski Archive.) This was purely by chance, since the WFPC2 observations were taken years before the discovery of the failed supernova. It's good luck that the region of the galaxy where the failed SN took place was imaged by WFPC2, and only slightly bad luck that it wasn't in a region imaged by the planetary-camera ("PC") chip. WFPC2 is/was an array of four equal-sized CCD chips, each with 800 x 800 15-micron-wide pixels. However, the optics were set up so that 3 of the chips (the WF chips) were imaged using a focal ratio of F/12.9, while the fourth (the PC chip) was imaged separately with a focal ratio of F/28.3. In essence, a magnified optical beam was focused on the PC chip, giving a scale of about 3.0 milli-arcseconds per micron, or 0.0455 arc seconds per pixel. Meanwhile, the WF chips received a scale of 6.67 milli-arcseconds per microns, or 0.097 arc seconds per pixel. This undersamples the actual resolution of the telescope (which has a point-spread function with a full-width half-maximum of about 0.09 arc seconds in the I-band). The UVIS (UV-visual) part of WFC3 has two 2k x 4k CCDs (with, I think, 15 x 15 micron pixels) and a focal ratio of F/31, which works out to 0.0395 arc seconds per pixel. So in practice, WFC3 will always resolve things better than the WF chips of WFPC2 can, because its pixels can properly sample the telescope resolution and the WF pixels cannot. You can see the difference in the upper "progenitor" (WFPC2) images, compared with the lower "2015" (WFC3/UVIS) images from the actual paper: 

Importance for star formation: They are all relevant to star formation, one way or another. One key property of turbulence is to cascade from large to small scales; therefore, even if you inject turbulence at large scales (galactic scale) you'll get turbulent motions down to the scale of a molecular cloud. A nice illustration of the tubulent cascade is the Larson's relation (Larson 1981): 

(See this Wikipedia page) The temperature needed for hydrodgen burning is 10 million Kelvin, so that's how hot a star must be to be considered as a star. It needs to get so hot, because else it will fail to burn hydrodgen and will become a "failed star": a brown dwarf. Edit: Surface temperature can be misleading, since the temperature ranges in which lay stars are not populated only by stars, but also by other objects such as hot Jupiters, with surface temperature ranging from 1000 to 3000 K. 

That is an intersting question as this is far from being obvious. Actually, for quite some time it was believed that planets should indeed spin retrograde (we can at least track it back to Laplace in his Exposition du Système du Monde published in 1976 where he developed his nebular hypothesis). How to prove that planet should spin prograde? We'll have to go back to their formation history. Let's start with an ideal case: particles moving in eliptical orbits around a central object of mass $M$, with a proto-planet of mass $m_0$, and rotating in a eliptical orbit. Let's look at what happens at a given point at a distance $r$ from the central object. First, for a planetesimal in a tangential external orbit, then for a planetesimal in a tangential internal orbit. Tangential external orbit We can write Newton's Second Law ${\bf F} = m {\bf a}$ and project it on the current trajectory axis (normal and tangent), knowing that the acceleration is always something like $v^2/R$, with $R$ the curvature radius (that is different from $r$, the distance to the central object). We get for the normal component: $$\frac{GM}{r^2} \cos \alpha = \frac{v_{ext}^2}{R_{ext}^2},$$ $R_{ext}$ being the curvature radius of the planetesimal in an external orbit. For the proto-planet: $$\frac{GM}{r^2} \cos \alpha = \frac{v^2}{R^2},$$ $\alpha$ having the same value for both object, since it denotes the angle between the direction toward the curvature center and the central object and the orbits being tangential at this specific point, where $r$ the distance to the central object is also the same. Therefore: $$\frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{v_{ext}^2}{R_{ext}^2}.$$ As $R < R_{ext}$, we have $v < v_{ext}$. Tangetial internal orbit With the same argument, we can show that $v > v_{int}$ (I let it as an exercice; extra bonus point if you do it with the energy conservation law). Consequences If you go in the reference frame of the protoplanet, you will see the internal planetesimal, rotating at a lower speed, coming backward, towards the proto-planet, and the external planetesimal, rotating at a faster speed, coming forward:
