Bjorn Lomborg argues that the implication of the latest IPCC report is that current mitigation policies are not smart in that the cost of mitigating CO2 emissions is much higher than the benefits: 

That last headline doesn't appear to be a subeditor's exaggeration as one expert commenting on the report report is quoted as saying: 

Cancer is one of those diseases that cause dread in its victims and their families. Though many are treatable or even curable, many others are not and there is great pressure on medics to offer any source of hope the those suffering from hard to treat varieties of the disease. And modern cancer drugs are often very expensive: 

Full Fact used the House of Commons Library analysis to produce three estimates in decreasing order of significance and impact: 

While the specific claim is exaggerated and doesn't support the argument for alternative medicine, there is evidence that a disturbing proportion of conventional medicine is unproven and wasteful When I first saw the headline question I thought it raised an interesting and challenging issue for modern medicine. Then I read the Freedom Health Canada argument which seems to want to make a case for applying "alternative" medicine. So while they raise interesting criticisms, the argument that conventional medicine hasn't been proved to work so you should be prepared to try other forms of medicine that haven't been proved to work, isn't coherent. But there is legitimate and skeptical criticism of much of what is done in the western medical establishment which is sometimes shockingly complacent when it comes to demonstrating the need and value of the treatments it offers. Some examples are given below. A good review of some of the key issues is found in the recent books Testing Treatments and Better Doctors, Better Patients, Better Decisions. The first chapter of the second book starts by quoting two extraordinary examples where the US health system overuses screening in expensive and damaging ways: 

Despite the consensus, there are good quality studies that don't find a strong link I think the scientific consensus is clear: almost everyone thinks secondhand smoke is bad. But skeptics should carefully consider, especially in areas where emotions run as high as this, the alternative views. Here is a large scale study of the long term effects of secondhand smoke that finds little impact on all cause mortality. The BMJ paper is here. The conclusion: 

To summarise the results: even at the weekend, alcohol-related admissions are low when general attendance is high, but high when attendance is low. So the proportion of alcohol-related attendance varies across the day with a peak in the early morning of about 70%. For the whole weekend, though, only about 15% of attendance is related to the demon booze. Quoting the maximum hourly rate of alcohol-related attends greatly exaggerates the problem (and guarantees, perhaps, press attention). The paper actually makes it quite hard to see the complete picture for the whole weekend (the charts are the only place the data are presented in a clear and complete form). The numbers may also be exaggerated by the choice to include other attendance by the same people outside the sample (the "prospective" cohort). It isn't clear from the method they use what the base is for the larger percentages in this cohort. It may exaggerate or it may not; it is hard to tell. There is another problem with the paper's method. They use a positive breath test to categorise whether an attendance is alcohol-related. This doesn't clearly link the reason for attendance to to consumption of alcohol. This might not be a cause of exaggeration, especially in Newcastle which has a heavy weekend drinking culture, but it is impossible to be sure. Summary The high numbers quoted in headlines are highly selective. It might be reasonable to say that 15% of attendances at weekends are from people who have recently consumed alcohol. In some or many of these cases the attendance will be indirectly caused by alcohol (e.g. falls). The 70% number comes from a highly selective view covering only a small percentage of the weekend where few people attend A&E anyway. Update BBC Radio 4's weekly programme More or Less (which studies dubious claims in headlines) mostly agrees with the analysis above. The podcast is here (section starts at about 15m:30s). The programme clarifies what is meant (talking to the original researchers) and criticises them for fuzzy language that could be easily misinterpreted. 

Yes, married people seem to live longer The apparent pattern that marriage seems to be good for you was first noted in the 19th century. But it has been confirmed in many studies since, though many of those suffer because they don't adequately adjust for other risk factors and, therefore, failt to isolate the effect of being married. But there are several accessible (ish, some are paywalled) modern studies. The Ben-Shlomo Et. Al. study in 1993 concluded (my emphasis in all quotes): 

The original source for this is a recent paper in Nature (paywalled). The chart makes a direct comparisons among CMIP5 forecasts (the grey distribution) and the observed path of temperature since the forecasts were made. (Note this was published after the Curry comment quoted above). Summary The effective visualization of complex data is difficult. But good advice exists (for example: see the guru of the field Edward Tufte's work; the Junk Charts readable and topical blog; or the usually excellent examples at Flowingdata. Unfortunately this advice is mostly ignored, especially by scientists who often seem to believe "the data in the chart was fine; what's the problem?" In pure visualization terms the IPCC's changes made an average chart much worse and obscured things a reasonable skeptic would have preferred to be clarified. The visualization changes made any comparison between model projections and observations much harder and much less statistically sound. In their defence, perhaps clarity was never their goal and they didn't have any competent visualization advice. 

Dioxins are not particularly toxic to people but are deadly to Guinea Pigs and some other animals Note: many of the facts below are from a summary of Dioxin evidence in John Emsley's book The Consumer's Good Chemical Guide. One of the things about dioxins that creates unwarranted worry is that chemists have devised ways to detect them in incredibly small quantities (in the 1950s they were lucky to reliably detect parts per thousand; by the 1980s fractions of parts per trillion were easily detected). This means they can now be detected almost everywhere. They are also fairly stable (though they are broken down by some bugs and by the UV component of sunlight) and slightly volatile, so they do get around a lot. It is also worth noting that there are a large range of different dioxins most of which are not at all toxic. The two archetypal nasty members of the class are shown below: 

No. Carefully blinded trials don't reproduce the effects claimed It would be extremely surprising if MSG was dangerous to people as glutamic acid the amino acid exists in all our proteins and we will all therefore contain some glutamate (the salt of the free acid). But it is possible that some people could be particularly sensitive to large amounts of it if added to food. The problem is that studies done with good scientific controls (double blinded) have never consistently shown that even those people who claim such sensitivity suffer the adverse effects when actually given MSG (and don't suffer them when even something other than MSG). As one review put it: 

This site already has a question on the general relationship of video games and violence. But the recent Florida school shooting has raised a more specific set of claims that deserve to be addressed. According to this Rolling stone report, the Kentucky State governor blamed video games: 

There is emerging evidence of a small effect suggesting HFCS is worse than sucrose and increases prevalence of diabetes and obesity There is, superficially at least, some reason to doubt that HFCS should be bad. Conventional sugar (chemically sucrose) is made of the smaller sugar molecules glucose and fructose and as wikipedia points out: 

There is no evidence that the acrylamide produced by browned food causes measurable harm to people The big worry about browning or burning food is the presence of acrylamide which is produced by the reaction of sugars and amino acids (via the Maillard reaction which also produces many of the attractive flavours of cooked food). The UK Food Standards Agency has launched a campaign to encourage people to reduce their exposure to acrylamide. This seems reasonable given that the chemical is pretty nasty in large quantities and is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals. But the dose makes the poison. David Spiegelhalter, an expert on the statistics of risk and the communication of science, has criticised the FSA campaign. The text below summarises his conclusions. Firstly, epidemiological evidence of any association of acrylamide intake from food and human cancer is missing despite extensive studies. As a large european literature analysis concluded: 

The referenced study is from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Its key conclusions are (my emphasis): 

In a critique (or possibly a rant) against modern climate science, Swiss geologist Christian Schl√ºchter makes a very specific claim that Alpine glaciers were essentially non-existent (or very much smaller than they are today) in Roman times. From a blog translating his original interview: 

The effects of particulate pollution have recently been in the news. In the UK the Daily Mail reported: 

The paper seems rather over-eager to demolish the well-known J-shaped curve between alcohol consumption and health (see this previous skeptics.SE answer). But in doing so ignores problems with its own evidence. error bars are wide and potential confounders are problematic (not least the issue about the reliability of recall as a way of measuring actual alcohol consumption). The actual data (as opposed the the conclusions given in the article summary) suggest that drinking moderately substantially improves cognitive performance and that this benefit only declines slowly with much larger alcohol intake. I don't think the headlines this story created were caused by poor journalism (for a change). The paper itself courts confusion and, more importantly, makes claims even its own data do not justify. 

Forecasting isn't reliable enough to trust any prediction of Peak Oil Peak oil is an interesting idea but one that suffers from a big statistical problem in addition to the obvious one (described in the first answer) that its predictions ignore shale oil. The problem is the utter unreliability of projections given the input data going into them. The best exposition of this is that I know of is by Edward Tufte (better known for his work on visualisation of data). Before he became famous for his other work he was asked (alongside 3 others working independently) to review forecasts of oil reserves in the USA. He concluded: 

Their paper contains many further references to the primary sources which I won't repeat here. Their analysis for drug launches since the mid 1990s is consistent with the idea that 90% of drugs don't significantly improve on previous drugs within an existing category (e.g. statins or NOACs). This is at least approximately the claim in the original question. NB Drugs are complicated things with no two drugs having exactly the same profile of therapeutic benefit and side effects. This creates a large grey area where better depends on how much weight you attach to each benefit and side effect. In many categories this creates a lot of scope for every drug firm's marketing department to claim that their drug is better. Independent experts prefer to count major indisputable therapeutic gains and ignore the minor squabbling about trivial differences (so drugs that treated ulcers were a major advance over surgery, but minor variations in the drugs from different firms were not significant gains).
