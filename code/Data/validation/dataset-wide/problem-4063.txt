Roger Penrose's The Road to Reality. Needham says in VCA that Penrose taught him what good style is. 

Rather than look at lists someone else has compiled of "what can you do with a degree in X?", I would suggest that it's more useful to go directly to the source: search job boards and company websites for the work people do outside education. A few places I think make sense to start: 

You might want to (or not) think about putting a sensor on each knee, each foot, each toe, etc., and consider the paths traced out by each sensor. You could use the language of diffeomorphisms and elastic deformations to talk about "small" (or large) deviations. You could also invoke some functional analysis to be a bit more specific about how the paths can deform. There are a lot of other perspectives you could take--like what about the forces that come up through the heels/metatarsals/toes and travel through both bone and soft matter? Or, finally getting back to what you brought up: the Lie algebra of parameter space which all the angles of the joints. There you're interested in questions that might be answered—or perhaps they'll lead you toward new questions instead—in an introductory differential-geometry or algebraic-topology text. (Spivak DG v1 or Hatcher AT will do.) But really what you want, I think, are some practical measurements—science derived from kinesiology—rather than pure-mathematics stuff. Ball-and-socket joints move in like a deformed disk; elbows and knees allow motion in a unit interval; and all of this is tied together with a product that's more complicated than Cartesian (you can't put your hand through your chest, for example). Sort of boring, mathematically; that's the stuff I mentioned above that's covered in an introductory DG or AT text. The more relevant information for you, maybe, will be in empirical/scientific specifics of real bodies.

Let $E_1$ denote the infinite enumerated collection of two-symbol ( as blank symbol and as non-blank symbol) one-tape (assuming that the tape is infinite in both directions) Turing machines: $${E_1} = \{ 1,\;\;2,\;\;3,\;\; \ldots \},$$ where each element is simply the index of the corresponding Turing machine. So, we can denote the $x$-th Turing machine by $\text{M}_x$. The exact technical description of the design of these machines can be found in “The game” section in Wikipedia article about Busy beaver. Let $G(x)$ denote the number of different states (not including the halting states!) of the corresponding $\text{M}_x$. It means that if there are $${(4n + 4)^{2n}}$$ $n$-state Turing machines, then $G(x) = 1$ if $1 \le x \le 64$, $G(x) = 2$ if $65 \le x \le 20736$ etc. Let denote an infinite sequence of consecutive blank symbols on the tape. Let $T_1$ denote the configuration when a Turing machine starts in the state $A$ on an infinitely blank tape. Then $T_2$ denotes the configuration when a Turing machine starts in the state $A$ with its head positioned over the single on the tape; $T_3$ denotes the configuration when a Turing machine starts in the state $A$ with its head positioned over the leftmost on the tape; $T_4$ denotes the configuration when a Turing machine starts in the state $A$ with its head positioned over the leftmost on the tape, etc. That is, machines always start in the state $A$ so that the head at the start is positioned over the leftmost non-blank symbol of the tape, and the number of consecutive non-blank symbols on the tape increases by 1. We define the following function: $F(x) = 0$ if $\text{M}_x$ halts on all configurations denoted by $T_y$ for any $y \ge 1$; otherwise, $F(x) = z$, where $z$ is the minimal positive number such that $\text{M}_x$ does not halt on the configuration denoted by $T_z$. Let $S(x)$ denote the largest number of shifts made by any halting $x$-state 2-symbol Turing machine that starts from an infinitely blank tape. This definition is equal to the definition of “Maximum shifts function” given in Wikipedia article about Busy beaver: $$S(1) = 1,\;\;S(2) = 6,\;\;S(3) = 21,\;\;S(4) = 107,\;\; \ldots $$ Then $E_1$ corresponds to the following infinite sequence of integers: $${E_2} = \left\{ {\left\lfloor {\frac{{F(1)}}{{S(G(1))}}} \right\rfloor ,\;\;\left\lfloor {\frac{{F(2)}}{{S(G(2))}}} \right\rfloor ,\;\;\left\lfloor {\frac{{F(3)}}{{S(G(3))}}} \right\rfloor ,\;\; \ldots } \right\},$$ where $\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor $ denotes a mathematical floor function. Consider four possibilities: Possibility 1: $E_2$ contains finitely many different integers and this amount is denoted by $Y$; then there exists the largest integer in $E_2$ and this integer is denoted by $Z$. Question if Possibility 1 is true: is it possible to estimate a lower and upper bounds for $Y$ and $Z$? Possibility 2: $E_2$ contains infinitely many different integers. Question if Possibility 2 is true: is it possible to prove (or back up) this? Possibility 3: $E_2$ contains all integers. Question if Possibility 3 is true: is it possible to prove (or back up) this? Possibility 4: $E_2$ contains infinitely many occurrences of any integer. Question if Possibility 4 is true: is it possible to prove (or back up) this? 

Assume that we have a pullback square $$ \begin{array}{ccc} A & \rightarrow & B \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ C & \rightarrow & D \\ \end{array} $$ with all functors accessible, and all categories presentable (if needed, assume that $A \to C$ and $B \to D$ are left adjoints). Suppose further that we have three saturated (that is, closed under retracts, pushouts and transfinite compositions) classes of arrows $S(B),S(C),S(D)$ of, respectively, $B,C,D$. Assume that the functors $B \to D, C \to D$ preserve these classes. (It seems likely to me that the set $S(D)$ should not play any importance in what follows) Form the set $S(A)$ by requiring that it consists of all arrows of $A$ that are sent to $S(B)$ and $S(C)$ by the respective functors. Question: if $S(B),S(C),S(D)$ are generated by (small) sets, does it imply that $S(A)$ is generated by a set as well? EDIT: it may be not obvious that the formed class S(A) is weakly saturated. Assume it is. EDIT2: I do not know if the original question admits an affirmative answer. What is true is that, following a remark of Tim to this post, one can consider the situation with the right classes. Let me leave a statement that may be of use for someone who googles this post up. Lemma. Let $A$ be a presentable category together with a weak factorisation system $(L,R)$ having the property that 

$(L,R)$ is functorial (a closer inspection may be used to drop this), The functor $A^{[1]} \to A^{[2]}$ associated to the weak factorisation system is accessible, The right class $R$ viewed as a subcategory of $A^{[1]}$ is accessible and accessibly embedded. 

I think the question “why we need” assumes something about “we”, and in some extent, about “need”. There are people who study those objects for their own sake, there are those who study applied PDE and have no need of model categories. Even those who enter the domain which can be covered by model categories often work in a specialised situation where more adapted techniques exist (homological algebra and triangulated categories for algebraic geometry being an example). I guess the meta-reason is that at the current historic moment (or maybe that will remain so indefinitely) any description of entities ‘’up to homotopy’’ from scratch cannot be done without having this ‘’up to homotopy’’ notion already defined. One has to break the vicious circle and pull things down from their ‘’platonic’’ world. Which brings me to the answer for Since categorical philosophy has proven itself to be reasonably natural, introducing categories with weak equivalences is both a natural step and something reflected in many examples. As we now know, this principle of modelling homotopy phenomena is, formally speaking, just as good as any other higher-categorical approach. Working with an arbitrary category with weak equivalences $(C,W)$ can be impossible in practice, but there are many ways to (homotopically) embed it into a model category. One can consider the category of simplicial presheaves on $C$ for instance, with a suitable Bousfield localisation of the projective model structure. (The examples usually present themselves with better, often canonical, embeddings.) One can thus work with the objects of $C$ by performing operations on the bigger model category and verifying that the answer is sensible for $C$. This adds to the explanation as why the notion is quite ubiquitous. Algebraic geometry (both the field and the community) has different tradition from algebraic topology, yet model categories have found their way here as well. For example, Kontsevich defines a noncommutative space as a suitable DG-category, and considers them up to Morita equivalence. There are a few model structures on DG-categories, which cover both the usual DG- and Morita equivalences, and they have been used to get various results, such as the theorem representing DG-functors between quasicoherent sheaf categories as bimodules. Another issue is the structure of noncommutative cohomological invariants, Hochschild cohomology, Deligne conjecture, and related matters. Many of the results (including laying a foundation of derived algebraic geometry) were obtained by people outside of the core algebraic topology community, with the use of model categories.
