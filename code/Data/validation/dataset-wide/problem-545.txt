Will it work? Probably. The range of movement of the mech wont be an issue and the chain will run through it, so I cant see why it wouldnt work. This article is quite helpful: $URL$ Shimano will tell you 11spd components wont work with 10spd though. If I were you I'd just get a 10spd rear mech. 

I had a Trek which broke entirely through in the same place. Turned out it was still ridable, and I managed to carefully ride it the 6 miles home. The frame was several years old, had seen some heavy use, and the frame, forks and handlebars were pretty much the only original parts. I took it back to my local Trek dealer, and after a bit of debate they contacted the Trek rep and they agreed to replace the entire bike! Good work Trek. Anyway, I'd certainly take your frame back. They should replace the frame and rebuild the bike for you. I doubt they will provide something for you to ride in the mean time though. 

You should be fine using a 105 cassette on the turbo wheel. There will be wear to the chain, cassette and chain rings, but provided the drive train is clean and lubricated then this should be minimal. Doing what you've suggested is a good solution. Try to make sure if you use the bike on the road then the drive train is reasonably clean before swapping onto the turbo wheel and if one cassette becomes more worn than the other then replace it, or you might then have problems and cause more wear on the chain. 

Replace all quick release fixtures with tooled fixtures. This is generally a small investment. Take a black marker to all component markings, making all those Deore XT's look at first glance like no-name-brand cheapo components. Either give your bike a crappy paint job -- spray paint some garish, noticeable color. Dont' bother making it beautiful, but make sure any brand markings or indication of quality of bike disappear. An easy alternative here is to wrap the frame in packing tape, which will make your bike look like a beater, but preserve the original finish if you ever want to resell it. Use a good lock, but it should look old and beat up, not like you take your bike too seriously. 

If you ride a lot in wet weather, you'll need to do this more frequently. Frequency, not quantity of oil is key in this situation. The most common mistake people make is over oiling their chains. The excess oil accumulates dirt and gets gunky making cleaning a hastle. Every single time you oil your chain, wipe it with a rag like this. Do this frequently enough and you'll always have a nice clean drive train. If your chain oil always comes of black (blacker than whatever lubricant your using which is rarely black), just do this process frequently until things start looking nice. 

Also note weight, including rotational weight, only affect acceleration (and maybe climbing a teeny bit), not how much work it takes to maintain cruising speed. Rolling resistance and wind resistance affect what your top speed is. So if your can keep up with your colleagues cruising speed but not acceleration, focus on weight. Otherise focus on aerodynamics and rolling resistance. 

The cog and/or freewheel will not come with the hub unless it explicitly states it (it is not typical to come with it, as rear cogs come in different tooth count and width) To make this easier, these are all the parts required for a fixed gear bicycle with a threaded headset: 

For only 3 miles, I would find a used, steel framed, no suspension mountain bike that you can put some slick road tires on there. And if you're in Boston, go have a chat with these nice folks about your needs and you can learn to fix it, too! Bikes Not Bombs has been around since forever. Once you have put a couple months into into commuting, throw down the money for a new ride after you have first-hand experience to know your riding prefence. 

I'm installing bar-end shifters for the first time (Shimano 9-speeds, for what it's worth) and was wondering if I should be running the tape over the bottom of the handlebar with surplus to insert into the bar. In the past, I've done this and used wine corks or handlebar caps to hold the tape in. When using cloth tape, this is no problem; foam/cork tape usually is fine too. But is it the same with bar-end shifters? 

I know this will affect the looks of the vintage bike, but I would personally put a quality threadless stem adaptor on the bike, then add a threadless stem. You can swap the stem around, flip it upside down, get fitted at your LBS, all without un-wrapping the bar tape, pulling at least one brake lever off, and removing the bars (which is a requirement for changing out a quill stem). Your other option is to use the limited number of quality quill stems remaining in the world, which usually tend toward either expensive or short (and rarely both). I linked to Velo-Orange not because I work there, but because their stems are affordable, light, strong and beautiful. 

I had one of these. With the exception of the narrow brush (which can be bought seperately), whos curved, toothed end is wonderful for cleaning gunk out of cassettes, I found the tool a waste of money. I wound up throwing mine away. If you're seeing a lot of grime, your problem is almost certainly not the conditions in your area, although this can exacerbate the problem. Rather, you probably leaving too much oil on your chain/drivetrain. The following will work better than the Park cleaner, save you money, and reduce your environmental impact. Equipment needed 

Regular maintenance I do this once a week, or daily when riding in inclement weather. That's pretty frequent, but the more frequently you do it, the quicker and easier it goes. You can experiment with frequency depending on your riding conditions, but you should find this is all the drivetrain maintenance you need until you chain wears out, with the gunk-cleaning being a special case. 

For those of you that want to commute on a nice bike in bad neighborhoods, let me give you a few tricks that have served me well. 

Let me contradict some of the other answers here. Weight is not going to make a lot of difference to your speed or endurance, so just ignore it. If you don't believe me, try the following experiment: Pack a 500g weight (about a pound) somewhere that you can comforetably carry it (e.g. in a backpack, or around your waist). Go on a few rides and measure your speed. The compare your speed without the weight. You'll have to do a few experiments to get good experimental data. The fact is your body weight fluctuates from day to day more than you're likely to be able to shave off your bike. (remember F=ma applies to whole thing you're moving -- including your body weight, backpack, water, etc.) On the other, ride geometry, aerodynamics, and power-efficiency can make a huge difference. Here are some important factors:
