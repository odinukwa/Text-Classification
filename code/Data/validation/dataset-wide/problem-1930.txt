The very fine point you're missing here is that the project bonus has been promised with conditions, whereas bona fide overtime hours must be paid out unconditionally due to legislation. The company is using the proposed bonus as a golden carrot. No matter how many hours you put in, the maximum bonus stays the same. WHY on earth would any thinking person believe that such an arrangement is really an incentive? In fact, it is not. This is worth talking to an attorney about. 

If you're getting ill, file a Workers Compensation claim. If that doesn't get someone's attention that you are serious about the working conditions, I don't know what else will besides you quitting. They will be required to respond, by law. 

numberbarn.com is a service I've used. You get a phone number that forwards to your cell or other phone, and you can have it go to voicemail after hours. I use this because I get a ton of phone calls from recruiters. I put the numberbarn-issued phone number on my resume and in e-mails, because of the sheer volume of calls and the fact that some think nothing of calling at six in the morning. $URL$ 

Everything we do is in a context. Some of us have to deal with phone calls both in the office as well as on the road. Any client would be real stupid to not consider the FACT that certain things just can't be achieved in a conversation when either a service provider OR the client happens to be on a mobile phone in some place where the background noise can't be controlled. As such, the same works for messages. The footer works, because it says that the sender is not immediately available for certain types of exchanges via e-mail. It actually helps to set realistic expectations, which is MORE professional, in my opinion. It doesn't lower the level of service; in fact, it improves it. The only thing I'd change is for the message to read "sent from my mobile", vs advertising someone's brand name. 

It's doubtful that your laptop will even be a concern for internships. Devices in most businesses need to be centrally managed to accommodate things like virus signatures and critical security updates. Rogue personally-owned PCs are frowned upon, because since the business doesn't own them, they have no control over what's installed on them. In certain high-security environments, they don't even want them in the building! Organized businesses, when they purchase, buy the same type (or family) of machine in bulk because it's easier to maintain than lots and lots of variations. Again, there will be little interest in supporting whatever brand you purchased when something's not working right. And then there's the issue of software you need for work - if you don't have it, such businesses are usually not interested in paying for expensive licenses on personal devices. The decals are the least of concern for a business, unless they're offensive. 

Responses such as "they kept missing paydays" and "they deducted my check for insurance premiums, but didn't pay the provider" are not negative statements, they're objective truth. You don't even have to convey how you feel about what's happened. Any reasonable person should understand that if you go to work and aren't getting paid for it, it's time to go. 

"Professional" Facebook account? I wouldn't necessarily deem it as suspicious, but as the others have mentioned, it's rather superfluous in light of the fact that LinkedIn is the de facto site for professional social media. To add to that, Facebook frowns on multiple accounts. You may invest lots of time on said "professional" account, to end up having it get closed by the powers-that-be. Lastly, I subscribe to the old adage of not mixing business with pleasure. If strictly-professional contacts are sending friend requests to your personal Facebook account, decline them. I'd bypass this idea of multiple accounts entirely, for the simple fact that there are things in my personal life that my professional contacts just never need to have access to. I'd hate to toy with the very high risk that with multiple Facebook accounts, I'd eventually mix them up and post the wrong content to the wrong account; even though it can be deleted later, the exposure cannot be, and as we see in the news each day, the consequences can be severe. 

Don't speculate! When you don't have a solid answer to these types of questions, stick to your guns. "I don't know" is a much, much better response than speculating. You don't want any finger-pointing in your direction when someone takes your speculation as fact and then screws something up. DO NOT WAVER in deferring that type of stuff to your manager, or anyone else but yourself. It's a pain in the rear to endure, but eventually others will figure out that you're firm in your position and stop badgering you. 

No, no, absolutely not. Here's the worst case scenario. You resign from company A, but have no signed contract from company B. No signed contract means that you do not have an offer AND an acceptance of the offer BEFORE you wrap up with company A. So what if you show up, and the terms of said contract are materially different than what you've agreed to orally? You agree orally to work M-F, but the contract calls for weekends. You agreed orally to work for $x/hr, but the contract calls for a lower pay rate. What then? At that point, friend, you are screwed. There are lots of unscrupulous businesses out there. Make sure you don't become a victim. 

The "told my friends I'd help out" answer is good. You could also say that you're involved with a "humanitarian organization", or any good, truthful adjective that throws the scent off the ideas of "activist" or "political". Don't give your boss the (figurative) hammer to nail you with. 

At this point, FORGET everything the recruiter has told you, and ignore anything else outside of the recruiter giving you specific information on meeting with the company. The recruiter has played "operator" between you and the company, but is potentially clueless. It's all up to you now. Forget any information you've been told about the commute. Do your own research. You don't want to be on the job for six months and be saying to yourself, "That recruiter misled me!" Get the FACTS about the job from whoever your contact is at the company. Hear them from the horse's mouth. Most inexperienced recruiters only know buzzwords-on-resumes, but they don't know how X relates to Y relates to Z. So the recruiter may give you an impression that X is important or relevant to the company, when it's not actually so. Do your own homework, and use the recruiter to facilitate further conversation. Do not feel guilty about needing to get your questions answered ... or you may find yourself in deep regret later!!! Take the situation for what it's worth. If you can ignore the recruiter and still move forward in the process, great! 

8 hours means that they are giving you a 'production' problem to solve. If the test you are doing produces a result which will further the interests of the business, what they are doing is highly unethical. They could be interviewing and giving each person a different part of a problem to solve, and getting work done for free. I've encountered this before. Don't be afraid to raise your concerns. If they are working unethically now, it's not going to get better when you get the job. 

There are hordes of related technologies, and I'm sure a recruiter or hiring manager is probably going to be specific in his/her interest. It might seem a little tedious, but you'll do more good by including them. The recruiters and HR people DON'T CARE about what seems repetitive. They are not developers. They scan resumes and look for keywords, and filter accordingly. Missing keywords means no interviews. That's just the way it is. Yes, it's inefficient; I've actually put "Transact-SQL" and "T-SQL" on my resume because they are clueless to the fact that they're the same thing. Don't be a snob, because it's going to keep many doors closed for you. (I'm also a .NET developer.) 

You're unsure because your only exposure is on-the-job, and you have no bearing of your own position otherwise. You can do a few things: 

Nate, don't worry about it. In a year, 75% of those recruiters will have moved on to some other job where they actually make a buck. Turnover rate with recruiters is extremely high. The rest don't care that you've lost contact, because they've learned not to take things personally. It's the only way they can survive in the business, so there's no need to preoccupy yourself as long as you've left off on a positive note at your last contact. Politely turn down the offer, and say that you'll hope to speak again in the future. It's that simple. 

Just because they've piled up stuff doesn't require that you suddenly become Superman in an effort to fix it all. Glide through your last two weeks. Take your lunch and breaks as before, and leave and go home on time. When pressed, just smile and say you're doing your best. DON'T make any promises you can't keep because your employer may try to justify something stupid (like holding your check, or docking your pay) for stuff you agree to complete but cannot. Seems like you work for some real jerks. Also, here in California, the employer has to have the final paycheck ready on or before the last day worked. See if something similar applies to you. 

Additionally, I learned a good maxim from a former supervisor. He said that when it comes to project work, "Fast (turnaround), cheap, or good (quality)? Pick the two that are most important to you, because you won't have the third!!" Hope this helps. 

OMG, I'm dealing with this RIGHT NOW, with someone who was actually hired in a senior-level position. (As it turns out, he was never tested coming through the door.) If it's not company-specific "tribal knowledge", my standard response is "Google". I've also had to have a conversation with my supervisor, because there have been situations where this person has literally bugged me all day long. My supervisor agreed that it's important at this point to flush out how well this guy (who was hired as a "senior") can do independently. I also learned that my boss suspects that this person's been able to hide this skills lapse behind my predecessors - but agrees that this behavior will be unfit for the projects we have on-board for the future. At one point I spent time on directing the guy to use solution "A" for a problem, but he got the jitters over whether we were authorized to use such an approach (but refuse to ask our boss), and did something else anyway. After that, I was done. I don't have the authority to direct his work, so it's foolish for me to take implicit responsibility for what he does. 

The situation you're describing with the current software is called technical debt. At some point, you're going to have to let stuff go. It's not perfect, and may never be. I think you may be more used to working by yourself and having complete control over a project, but now you're working with someone else underneath the same manager. Relax a little! You've described how the project was rushed, like a big wave at the beach crashing on the sand; and when the wave came, you didn't do anything to get yourself out of the way. The best thing you can do RIGHT NOW, that you can actually control, is take a nice vacation away from work. Step away. Regroup. Rejuvenate yourself, take some of the stress off your brain, and do a self-inventory to figure out what's really important in your personal life. Things at work will always eventually come to a compromise (which may or may not agree with your 'values'), but if you're getting a paycheck regularly and the ultimately responsibility falls on your boss' shoulders, WHY STRESS OUT ABOUT THIS? So for now, forget about reasoning with your colleague. Try being reasonable with yourself. 

I would draft an email, and carbon-copy your supervisor: "Dear Bob: I've noticed a pattern of behavior in which you interrupt me often to show me how well you can complete tasks that have been assigned to me and not assigned to you. Please, let's make it clear. If I need your assistance, I'm quite capable of asking you. Otherwise, please stick to your assigned tasks unless our supervisor has asked you to get involved with mine. There's no need for duplication of work. I'm also aware that you don't show the same type of unsolicited involvement to the males on our team. I'd really hate to have to escalate your behavior to management as a gender concern. Thanks for your understanding." Done. 

If it ever went to court, that clause in the NDA would probably be thrown out if challenged, due to a concept called procedural unconscionability. A few elements: 

Whatever you do, you're going to have to walk in the door with approaches to solve the problem. No one's interested in what you have to say if you aren't vested in taking next steps. How will you solve the problem? Is your approach easily duplicated? P.S. The OTHER thing - that I won't get into deeply, just to keep on topic - is that you shouldn't be relying on storing session state in RAM anyhow, but instead, looking into SQL Server or similar storage for session data. 

Here's probably the most reasonable thing to consider. When the six months elapsed, or was about to, did you ask what was going on?? Or did you assume they'd take care of transitioning you, and just let you know whenever it was to take place? Since you didn't specify, it seems that the latter case applies. If you didn't ask about getting transitioned to perm, you can't be upset with missing that bonus money as a result. What is a priority to you isn't necessarily one to your management, especially if you're putting out good work and other pressing matters are at hand. The closed mouth won't get fed! 

The word for the day is "VIRTUAL MACHINES". Get yourself a Vmware, Hyper-v, or Virtualbox instance. Try different stuff in all that free time you've got. Do what interests you, and if it gets boring or you get stuck, flush the virtual machine down the toilet and try something else. Read up on current trends, and just try stuff out. You might find something that interests you in a completely different direction than the stuff you've already learned... go with it! If you've got the time on your hands and the situation is more or less peaceful, then consider where you're at as a walk-in-the-park. Someone's paying you great money to sit on your duff and 'mind the shop'??? What part of that are you complaining about? (smile!) 

A week???? If this is part of the company's hiring process, and they gave you enough to encompass a week's time, then you and other applicants are probably being used for free work anyhow. A generic technical test is reasonable. On the other hand, when you apply for a job, and you're given something as a prerequisite that actually benefits the company (i.e. the company stands to make some money, or materially improve some internal process), it's probably in your interest to decline and point out that you don't work for free. 

Years ago, I listed Brainbench exam scores on my resume to make my skill level more obvious. The word "certificate" itself might be bogus, but if you can show numbers that demonstrate you've tested out in a high percentile of test-takers, I think it can go a long way for you. People like numbers. 

This is a load of crap. They do this to line their pockets with a few more bucks. It's a negotiating tactic. You might be promised a future increase, but the person who's making promises isn't putting a specific date or amount-of-increase into your written contract. Without said specific writing, they're just blowing smoke up you-know-where. If you're a competent developer, why is it that your work on day 1 should be valued at less than your work six months after that point? Look, you don't buy a car, groceries, or anything of value by way of a "test" deal. I've never heard of a "test" mortgage. Nine times out of ten when a company tells you that they'll review your performance at some interval after your start date, it's a ploy to get you to shut up and accept less. And six or nine months after your start date, you've become comfortable in your role and are less likely to bail out. Also, if you start asking about an increase and get nowhere, it's more challenging to try and find the job that pays what you want if you're already working and your boss knows you're dissatisfied. Get your worth from the start, or go elsewhere.
