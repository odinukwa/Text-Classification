Computing the variance or standard deviation of the growth rate of a variable is quite a common procedure to get volatility figures. 

I recommend reading Dani Rodrik's new book, Economics Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science. Rodrik supports the use of mathematics as bringing clarity of meaning, and argues that the subject is far more applied and empirical than its detractors realize. The final couple of pages have Rodrik's Ten Commandments for Economists. Numbers one and two are: Economics is a collection of models; It's a model, not the model. And also Ten Commandments for Non-Economists, which include: maths is useful; economists are not all alike; economists typically do understand how markets work. 

The fact that "trade in the United States seems to have grown substantially faster than production" could be explained by reduction in trade costs. For instance, a decrease in importing partners' tariffs tends to favor US exports. So, for the same level of production or GDP, US sales will be more export oriented. It works similarly for US imports following a reduction of US tariffs. A first explanation to the reduction in trade costs is the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers (such as administrative fees or quotas), that is changes in trade policy. Trade liberalization policies could be unilateral, multilateral, regional or bilateral. Regional trade agreements for instance have become increasingly prevalent since the early 1990s, according to the WTO. A second explanation to the reduction in trade costs is related to technological progress such as faster communications. Note that it is common to compute a country's trade openness index as the ratio of a country's trade (exports plus imports) to its GDP. Controlling for GDP allows economists to evaluate the outward or inward orientation of a given country's economy. Moreover, this ratio could be computed over time to measure the extent of globalization. For instance, according to the World Bank data Chinese trade openness ratio raised from 2.6% in 1970 to 39% in 2006. The US ratio increased from 9.7% in 2001 to 13.5% in 2011, which is consistent with the facts you mentioned. 

A good reference is the Barro-Lee Dataset wich gives educational attainment for 146 countries from 1960 to 2010. The data are disaggregated by sex and by 5-year age intervals. Their estimates of educational attainment provide a reasonable proxy for the stock of human capital. An older reference is hosted by the World Bank. In case you need more recent data, you may apply their methodology. 

The question is not clear to me but relates to the canonical example of instrumental variables, which involved attempts to estimate specifically demand and supply curves. Here, the OP considers an exogenous demand-side shift so an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of quantities on prices is a possible tool to "think about situations like this". However, if the demand and supply curves shift over time, the observed data on quantities and prices reflect a set of equilibrium points on both curves. Consequently, a tool such an ordinary least squares regression of quantities on prices fails to identify either the supply or demand relationship. Wright (1928) confronted this issue in the seminal application of instrumental variables (IVs). He suggested that certain curve shifters, called IVs, can be used to address the problem: 

The result that `healthcare costs will rise if people stop smoking because they live longer and use more healthcare' is a sort of (very) partial equilibrium result (and somewhat pointless). By living longer, people will work longer, and by being in better health conditions they will certainly be more productive. So, in the long run, the effect could be positive in terms of welfare, with higher healthcare costs in absolute terms but lower in relative terms, that is, in terms of GDP. Update on the link between productivity and smoking: Akerlof and Kranton (2010) in their book Identity and Economics (chapter 3) cite a Center for Disease Control and Prevention report (2002): productivity losses due to smoking have been estimated at $82 billion per year. 

Let me try to answer to the "debate whether China has fabricated its GDP in the past". The rest of the question is too broad to be answered properly and should be rephrased. Jia, Kudamatsu, and Seim (2015) use the methodology of Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil (2012) to corroborate the quality of the provincial growth data by checking if it reflects the growth in nighttime lights observed by satellites. Nighttime lights can be seen as an objective measure of living standards, and therefore its correlation with GDP is indicative of the quality of GDP data. They find such a correlation suggesting that real GDP growth, at least to some extent, reflects improvements in some dimensions of living standards captured by nighttime lights. 

Redding and Weinstein in their paper "A Unified Approach to Estimating Demand and Welfare" develop a unified price index that nests all existing major price indexes. Existing price indexes can be thought of as arising from the imposition of parameter restrictions on their unified index. Their examination with barcode data suggests that standard methods of measuring welfare overstate cost of living increases by ignoring new products and demand shifts. However, contrary to the Boskin report, they do not put an overall number on the bias. 

Although the verdict is not yet in, the evidence indicates that regionalism is broadly liberalizing. So regionalism does not go against globalization. 

Model-based assessments taken from studies that make use of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models for the analysis of specific reforms Empirical analysis based on aggregate or sectoral data. Look in particular at Bouis, R., O. Causa, L. Demmou, and R. Duval (2012), "How quickly Does Structural Reform Pay Off? An Empirical Analysis of the Short-Term Effects of Unemployment Benefits Reform", IZA Journal of Labor Policy 2012, 1:12. Empirical analysis based on micro studies. In this category, a recent paper that is not reviewed in the OECD report but in a VOX CEPR column on Eurozone rebalancing: Are we on the right track for growth? Insights from the CompNet micro-based data. Their results are "in line with the postulate that the crisis and ensuing structural policies may be generating ‘cleansing effects’." The author are cautious, however. "It is obvious that the evidence presented is still preliminary and only suggestive of the potential use of the dataset." 

Barry Naughton is an authority on the Chinese economy. He offers evidence on China's government control over the economy in a nice paper called "Is China Socialist?" China's government controls an unusually large proportion of national income flows. He argues that these income streams have grown dramatically as a share of GDP since the mid-1990s. He shows how the Chinese government steers the economy because it sees a strong economic performance as a core part of its political legitimacy. China's government has some tools to "shield the public from job cuts or factory closings" because of American tariffs. Beyond the tools of funding direct government programs and ownership, the Chinese system has two distinctive mechanisms through which it attempts to foster development: 

Nick Bloom, from Stanford, and some co-authors develop indices of economic policy uncertainty for the world's major economies. Their Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is based on newspaper coverage frequency of policy-related economic uncertainty. In case this is useful, their web page explains the methodlogy and the applications. 

Then, the question is: what does explain the change from tipping to no-tipping service? My answer is unfortunately more opinion-based than fact-based. It could be that 

Source: Hall and Krueger (2015) More generally, they point out that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a supplemental module to collect information on various forms of contingent and alternative work arrangements in the Current Population Survey (CPS) in 1995, 2001, and 2005 that provides the most informative data available, although it is now somewhat out of date. The BLS contingent worker supplement also measured the share of workers in alternative work arrangements, including independent contractors. Workers in the sharing economy can work part-time or full-time, or participate on a temporary or permanent basis, but they are almost universally working as independent contractors while they are participating in the sharing economy. Thus, evidence on independent contractors can provide relevant background for understanding the nature of the labor market in a sector that overlaps with the sharing economy. 

Look also at Bouis, R., O. Causa, L. Demmou, and A. Zdzienicka (2012), "The Short-Term Effects of Structural Reforms: An Empirical Analysis", OECD Economics Department Working Papers, No. 949. They conclude 

I very much like this question and Alecos' answer. We understand the role of transaction costs in the generation of externalities. But the transaction costs concept itself is very difficult to define rigorously. Dalhman (1979) examines what kinds of transaction costs are necessary to generate externalities. He defines a workable concept of transaction costs: search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, policing and enforcement costs. But he adds (p. 148) that 

Let me give an example of temporary versus permanent shocks to illustrate my understanding of the question. Consider agriculture production. The adoption of a new production technology will be a permanent supply shock because, e.g. by improving productivity. So, this productivity shock will affect permanently supply conditions (production and prices). In contrast, abnormal rainfall are typically considered as temporary supply shocks because they will only temporary affect production and prices. Their effects are even considered as local. 

So, if you assume that all Columbian production is produced by Escobar's cartel his total benefit is about USD $75 billion for the year 2009. Edit: However, we cannot assume that Escobar's cartel got 89% of the retail value (thanks to @Alecos Papadopoulos for this point). The USD 75 billion is the equivalent of the "box office" for a movie - but the producers of the movie (i.e. Escobar's cartel) do not get all the box office. Then, the question is what is the proportion retained by the Escobar's cartel? I have no clue! However, Levitt and Vetakesh QJE paper document that "earnings within the (drug) gang are enormously skewed (..) with high-level gang members earning far more than their legitimate market alternative." So, by extrapolating from this result and assuming that the drug market is vertically integrated and controlled by the Escobar's cartel, we may speculate that the latter (and Escobar himself) may get a big part of the box office. In this report, you may also find more reliable estimates about 

Your question relates to an important research topic on the link between automation and employment. David Autor works on this issue and the topic "Inequality, Technological Change and Globalization". He published a very recent and interesting JPE paper on “Why Are There Still So Many Jobs?” 

There is a very nice survey by Aviv Nevo on Empirical Models of Consumer Behavior. He surveys some of the models used in the literature. In particular, he discusses two commonly used demand systems: multi-stage budgeting approaches and discrete choice models. We may also find interesting Recent Developments in Empirical IO: Dynamic Demand and Dynamic Games by Victor Aguirregabiria and Aviv Nevo. 

What is the 'Rotterdam effect'? Dutch trade flows are over-estimated because of the so-called ‘Rotterdam effect’ (or quasi-transit trade): that is goods bound for other EU countries arrive in Dutch ports and, according to EU rules, are recorded as extra-EU imports by the Netherlands (the country where goods are released for free circulation). This in turn increases the intra-EU flows from the Netherlands to those Member States to which the goods are re-exported. To a lesser extent, Belgian figures are similarly overestimated. 

If I understand correctly the question, the trick to calculate the equilibrium (relative) price of trade in the Ricardian model of comparative advantage is to specify demand once the opportunity costs have been determined. Prices of internationally traded goods, like other prices, are determined by supply and demand. Consider two countries, two goods (computers and textiles), and given unit labor requirements such that in equilibrium the world price of computers will be between 0.5 and 2 textiles per computers. The opportunity costs define the bounds of equilibrium relative prices of trade (0.5 and 2), while the structure of demand determines the equilibrium relative price (p). For instance, can be an equilibrium price such as one country will specialize in computers and the other in textiles. This price will be determined by the interaction of the relative supply and the relative demand of computers and textiles. This interaction is discussed in the Chapter 3 of International Economics: Theory and Policy of Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz. An interesting video with a concrete example can be found here.
