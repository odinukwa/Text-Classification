I wouldn't say water is naturally cooler than air. What I would say is that water has a higher heat capacity than air. This means it takes more energy to affect the same increase in temperature and conversely it takes water longer to cool down than air. You can see this at night near bodies of water when the sea breeze changes to a land breeze as the land becomes cooler than the water - water temperatures tend to be stable across diurnal cycles. I would also contest the statement that water cools the air. Water does both heating and cooling. When water evaporates into air, the air cools. However take a look at any thunderstorm you see -- that is water causing heating as it condenses and freezes. Water on the surface can also contribute to both heating and cooling. During the day the cool water surface will have a heat flux that cools the air while at night the opposite may be true. This depends on the air temperature and the SST. Now on to your question, yes, there would still be wind if there were no water. The energy that drives the wind is differential solar heating at the earths surface. Variations in the surface topography and the shape of the earth mean that the solar flux isn't constant across the earth. As long as we have a sun we will have surface pressure differences and wind. Without water we would also see a stronger equator-to-pole temperature gradient (look at temperature variations right now on continents versus open ocean). This would result in stronger winds that we see today. 

An arch is a poor analogy for tectonic plates. The lithosphere is supported beneath by the mantle, unlike an arch which is unsupported beneath. If the lithospheric plates were only held together only by lateral stress, friction with surrounding plates and gravity, how would they move relative to each other? How would forces at the plate interfaces vary? How would subduction work without the whole thing falling apart? I am not a geologist but I cannot see how this arrangement would work. The mantle "fluid" that sits underneath the lithosphere convects and drives plate motion. It accepts subducting plates and emits new oceanic crust along the mid-oceanic ridges. The support everywhere underneath the lithosphere by the asthenosphere makes an arch a poor representation for the physics at work. Yes, you are correct that at the tectonic plate edges there is lateral stress and friction and that the whole plate is subject to gravity. What you are missing is that the crust is everywhere supported underneath. An arch relies on the lateral stress to stay standing while tectonic plates do not. 

Relative humidity is just $e/e_s$, the ratio of the vapor pressure to saturation vapor pressure or or $w/w_s$, the ratio of mass mixing ratios of water vapor at actual and saturation values. If you have specific humidity, which is the mass mixing ratio of water vapor in air, defined as: $$ q \equiv \dfrac{m_v}{m_v + m_d} = \dfrac{w}{w+1} \approx w.$$ Relative humidity can be expressed as the ratio of water vapor mixing ratio to saturation water vapor mixing ratio, $w/w_s$, where: $$ w_s \equiv \dfrac{m_{vs}}{m_d} = \dfrac{e_s R_d}{R_v(p-e_s)} \approx 0.622\dfrac{e_s}{p},$$ and from Clausius-Clapeyron: $$ e_s(T) = e_{s0}\exp\left[\left(\dfrac{L_v(T)}{R_v}\right)\left(\dfrac{1}{T_0} -\dfrac{1}{T} \right)\right] \approx 611\exp\left(\dfrac{17.67(T-T_0)}{T-29.65}\right).$$ Once you have calculated $w$ and $w_s$ you can obtain the relative humidity as: $$ RH = 100\dfrac{w}{w_s} \approx 0.263pq\left[\exp\left(\dfrac{17.67(T-T_0)}{T-29.65}\right)\right]^{-1}. $$ You could also calculate $RH = 100(e/e_s)$, but I think since you are starting with $q$ it isn't as straightforward as doing it this way. 

Tornadoes are primarily associated with supercell thunderstorms, though they can also be associated with landfalling tropical cyclones, squall lines and bow echoes. Thunderstorms are favored in the afternoon to early evening hours as this is when integrated solar heating throughout the day has warmed the boundary layer enough to kickstart convection (through reaching the convective temperature or eroding the capping inversion). Because of this, supercells are going to tend to initiate in the mid to late afternoon and if they produce tornadoes it will be in the timeframe maximized in your graph. The tornado record is far from perfect and is based on verification of tornado damage. That damage will only be surveyed if a potential tornado is reported or radar strongly suggested that one may have occurred. A small tornado in the middle of nowhere from an unimpressive storm at night surely may exist, but a record of it may not. This is also true of middle-of-nowhere tornadoes during the day, but those may have a slightly higher chance of being reported by a storm chaser. No one smart chases at night. 

In short, this is because the location of a rainbow is not dependent on water droplets. The location is only dependent on the location of the Sun and of your eyes. The visibility of the rainbow is what depends on the presence of condensed water. As each drop passes through a location that corresponds to that of the rainbow your eye will see the reflected photons originating at the Sun. Before and after the rainbow, that individual drop is not in a location that allows you to see these reflected photons. The rainbow appears stationary because it is (as long as you aren't moving) and droplets are falling through it often enough that it always appears visible. 

Image from Skamarock et al. A description of the Advanced Research WRF Version 3 It appears the geogrid grid generation uses the 25x25 as the furthest extents of the grid (and this is backed up by the grid maximum needing to be a multiple of the grid ratio +1). As a result, only the and variables will see 25 grid points and each only in one direction, east/west and north/south respectively. All other variables are located horizontally on the $\theta$, or scalar points in the middle of the grid boxes and there will only be 24 of these points in your setup leaving most of your grids having a horizontal dimensions of 24x24. 

In order to produce such a plot, you need pressures on a common reference plane, which is often mean sea level or some other reference pressure level (e.g. 850mb, 500mb, 250mb). This is why stations report sea level pressure rather than actual station pressure. This also has applications for aviation, where aircraft operating below a specific altitude (18,000 ft in the US) have to reference their altimeters to a common value regionally and must know the local sea level pressure. 

A storm meeting these qualifications is a blizzard. Note that snowfall is not necessary, a sustained 35 kt wind blowing snow for 3 hours with low visibility is a blizzard. 

A 5x5 neighborhood sounds like a 25 point sample of values around your gauge. If you take those values and assume some distribution, the 10th percentile value would be the point on that distribution where 10 percent of the values are smaller than it and 90% are larger. It isn't clear, however, if they assume a Gaussian distribution or some other distribution. Take a vertical column above your gauge from the gauge to infinity. Sample the reflectivity at all heights in that column and report the highest value observed. Vertical column just means the atmosphere directly above the gauge extending to the top of the atmosphere. A radar pulse doesn't measure a point. The pulse has width and height that it samples. These dimensions are specified as the distance that the power of the pulse along its centerline is reduced to half. This is specified as an arc length as the pulse energy spreads out with distance from the radar antenna. Additionally the pulse has a length and this gives the pulse a depth. Combined this is the pulse volume and the volume varies with distance from the radar antenna and with characteristics of the radar itself. You can read more about this in a NWS Weather Decision Training Branch radar training course (Image below from this site). 

Your best bet without modern tools would be a sextant and the proper maps for celestial navigation. This is a time-tested and old method of navigation no longer in regular use, but it probably doesn't meet your "no over-technical methods" criterion as it requires a tool, maps and knowledge of its use. If you only had knowledge of the constellations and a few stars (e.g. Polaris, the Sun) you could probably figure out what region of the globe you were on and make a best-guess as to the direction of land. You might be able to do a similar guess with surface winds, ocean surface flow and temperature to get a rough location but if any synoptic conditions are masked by storms or local anomalies then this will likely not work. There are some semi-presistent weather features (e.g. the Bermuda high) that you could use along with knowledge of the general circulation that could potentially help you out. You could make similar estimates with ocean current and temperature (if you have equipment to measure this), but I think this would only provide regional benefits and may not work everywhere you could find yourself. These would also be marred by tropical convection (e.g. in the wake of a hurricane sea surface temperatures will be cooler than normal) and other storms. 

Lets apply what we've learned above and use the Rossby number in the synoptic scale (e.g. big cyclones) and in our toilet. Once again, at synoptic scale we'll use $U = 10\ \mathrm{m\ s^{-1}}$, $L = 10^6\ \mathrm{m}$, and $f = 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{s^{-1}}$ In our toilet we'll use $U = 0.5\ \mathrm{m\ s^{-1}}$, $L = 0.3\ \mathrm{m}$, and $f = 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{s^{-1}}$ The Rossby number in the synoptic scale is: $$Ro = \dfrac{U}{fL} = 0.1 << 1$$ The Rossby number in the toilet is: $$Ro = \dfrac{U}{fL} \approx 10^3 >> 1$$ This tells us that if we were to revisit the scaling argument we used to develop the Rossby number but instead in our toilet, that we'd find the accelerations to be much more important than Coriolis and that we can neglect that force. Also note that you do not have to get as small as a toilet to be unaffected by Coriolis. Tornadoes, for example, are unaffected by Coriolis and it isn't until you have long lived mesoscale convective complexes (MCC) and mesoscale convective vortices (MCV) that you start to see the effect of Coriolis on storm structure.
