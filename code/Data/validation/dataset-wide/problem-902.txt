The Unfortunates comprises 27 chapters. The first and last chapters are kept stationary, while the remaining 25 chapters are reflective vignettes shuffled into random order. The way that The Unfortunates maintains coherence in the face of complete "disorganization" effectively amounts to three things: 

I've been reading through a fraction of Ancient Greek literature, lately, and an odd thought occurred to me. In nearly every work of Greek literature that is tangentially related to sexuality (which, we've gotta admit, is quite nearly most of the well-known ones), sex is treated as universally desirable, and is a locus of control and power. Most of the discussion around women in Greek culture seems to revolve solely around sexuality. As another example, Eros is often referred to as being one of those omnipresent entities in male interactions in Greek culture. The Symposium goes into some manner of detail on this point about Eros, describing maleness and sexuality as effectively identical concepts with no real distinguishing factors. Still, beyond this, many of the Greek gods are described as sexually promiscuous. No emphasis seems to be placed in any writings on the absence of sexuality in the Greek gods. Here, I mean asexuality to be the total absence of sexual attraction, with anyone. This is a concept distinct from both celibacy (not having sex for a particular reason) and abstinence (not having sex by choice). For example: 

More history for the curious: the origins of cantillation as a practice are not dated, and potentially aren't dateable at all. The Jewish Encyclopedia cites that: 

This essay was published in 1944. So we know that issues of modern politics, particularly those surrounding the state of the world at the time of WWII, seems to have (unsurprisingly) been on Orwell's mind for some time before he wrote the book. 1984 was published in 1949, five years after the writing of this essay. Did Orwell ever talk about what, specifically, motivated him to go from pondering on fascism to writing the actual book? 

This smacks of someone well-read. And these two examples were easy to find - if you search for "O'Brien," the book is littered with references to how knowledgeable he seems to be about the past. But that aside, this is also an important jab at Winston's only real hope at escape: 

These kinds of things, in addition to offhand references to "the Frail Sex" which go unchallenged, lead me to question whether, or which parts were intended as satire, and which parts were intended to remain unchallenged. Is there any way to tell? How do we know? 

Current consensus seems to be that cantillation marks as they are currently used originated around the 9th or 10th century CE, relatively recently in the history of Judaism. Cantillation itself has existed for a long while, but cantillation marks are a relatively recent means of codifying an otherwise opaque word-of-mouth (and potentially chironomical) system. There are very few facts about cantillation that are commonly held to be true, and there is a lot of debate about what the real history is. This codification wasn't exactly early on in the history of Judaism - if it were, we'd expect to see more references to the marks specifically in the Talmud. Baruch Davidson, via Chabad notes that: 

After reading through The Federalist Papers, I've come to the general conclusion that Hamilton's essays are, by and large, a stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'd be able to say exactly why, but after running the Papers through a word counter, it turns out that the average sentence length is around 30 to 40 words. The longest sentence in the Papers is actually 200 words: 

He just had no reason to put it on, and was involved with some other stuff at the time. Bilbo even regards it as so insignificant a point that he forgets he has it at all (emph. mine): 

Does the pattern go on past here? I'm not sure. It's hard to say, what with the poem itself being unfinished, and it being so many years since I've read either in much detail. It does leave open a pretty important question: what about the remaining three and a half chapters? But I think this definitively answers the questions: there is some kind of parallel here, though the book as a whole likely doesn't end when the poem does. The exact way to interpret this might just not be clear. 

The 1842 version is the more well-known version of this poem, and it most certainly is a revision of the first version. The University of Iowa (starting at "The Two Versions") conducted a thorough analysis of why Tennyson might have thought it necessary to make the changes he did. I'll give a rough summary, but many of the details are listed on that page. Many of the reasons for the changes largely come down to Tennyson potentially wanting to change how the poetic observer sees Shalott. The 1833 version focuses much more on the natural environment, whereas the 1842 version seems to focus much more on Shalott itself. One of the examples that page uses is that: 

With the poetic basis for understanding the structure of the haiku out of the way, let's talk history. The origins of haiku lie in religious practices, Shinto and Buddhist alike, as well as general poetic practices and culture. Songs frequently followed a form called waka. This form essentially boiled down to a combination of two other forms: choka, which follows 5-7-5-7...5-7-7, and sedoka, which follows 5-7-7-5-7-7. This precursor to haiku was just a culturally ingrained pattern - not unlike the four chord song [language warning]. It's just a shared recognizable pattern for music and poetry. And many forms for poetry diverged from there. The form called tanka is a specific form of waka, and is so frequently used interchangeably that it has muddied the meaning of waka. However, the tanka form is a refinement and restriction on the general pattern of waka: it follows the form 5-7-5-7-7 specifically. This form is often considered the precursor to what we now call haiku. Many poets laid their hands on shaping this form in between tanka and haiku. Enumerating them all is beyond the scope of this answer. Significant contributors were Matsunaga Teitoku, a wandering poet who wrote a plethora of prose and poetry, and Issa, who wrote often on the state of Japanese society. But the direct precursor to haiku is Masaoka Shiki, who took the form that had evolved over time, and focused in on 5-7-5. He is the person who gave it the name "haiku," largely under the banner of tanka reform. He wrote well over 25,000 haiku. It is largely the popularization of Shiki's writings in Japan that led to the prominence of the form elsewhere in the world. His commentary presented it as a simpler, cleaner aesthetic - its compressed nature, he wrote, could sketch life and reality much more easily than any more complex form could. This is a strong appeal to principles in Japanese culture, and is the ultimate aesthetic choice backing haiku. It was then spread through popular poets and poetry to English-speaking countries - except instead of Japanese phonetic units, they naturally counted in English syllables. The popularization of haiku spread from there into the 1950s, giving us the form we know it in today. 

Useful for reading the above reasources: if you're familiar with IPA: e is [ɛ], é is [ɛː], and ê is [ɛːː]. Each "ː" adds a little bit of extension; a "::" feels almost, but not quite, like two syllables. 

The Unfortunates isn't a book that conveys plot. It doesn't conform to many of the accepted norms of Western writing, and through its rejection, manages to position itself such that the only thing that matters to each vignette is its emotional context. On top of that, the narration within each vignette is, in some ways, also a facet of the nonlinearity. By making each individual vignette structurally nonlinear in its narration, the order in which they're read becomes a matter of which scene and which setting the reader encounters first. This ultimately isn't a jarring experience, because there's continuity established by the way the narrator goes about narrating. Unlike most Western storytelling, the questions of "how did we get here?" and "what's going on?" and "who wants what; what's in their way?" just aren't relevant. These sorts of questions are the ones that are needed to establish a linear order in a book at all, and the removal of the need to ask those questions paves the way for nonlinearity. This is part of the intentional design of the book, in calling itself an experimental novel. It's supposed to be presented in-text as a coherent story despite nonlinearity. But it's also presented on a meta-level as a challenge to the need for linear plot and many of the tropes of Western storytelling, while itself remaining within the comfort zone of the Western storytelling framework. The technique, then, effectively boils down to it stripping away any of the questions one could ask that would lead to a need for linearity at all. That's what gives it much of its power as a presentation of emotion and thought alone. 

It's pretty obvious from the chapter headings - not just this one, but others included - that Pinocchio's portrayed as a child who was born "bad." The nose plays into this. Heck, minutes, maybe hours into his existence, he's already committed his first murder: 

Pinocchio is born dishonest. This is both true in a symbolic way, as well as a literal way. Quite literally the first thing Pinocchio does after being born is get Geppetto thrown in jail: 

Much of the opening of chapter 2 of Simmons' Hyperion describes the pilgrims' journey through the capital city named Keats (which is definitely a total coincidence with no meaning). The Consul encounters Theo Lane, and has a discussion about how the city of Keats has grown and changed.
