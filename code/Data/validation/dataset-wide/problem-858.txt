For example, if you were to carefully draw the equator across the picture you posted, you'd see the Moon and Sun are not at opposite latitudes, which they would need to be to be as "far apart as possible". 

The reason for this, briefly, is that it still snows in high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere during mild winters and snow and Ice takes longer to melt during mild summers. If this persists over enough years, Snow cover can build up, which causes Albedo to rise and reflect more sunlight back into space, and less summer melting of ice, over many years, can lead to an ice age. Once an ice age gets going it's self perpetuating, sometimes referred to as feedback mechanisms. Axial Tilt reached a maximum about 8,700 BCE and it will reach a minimum in about 11,800 CE. The warming of the Earth from the Axial tilt maximum isn't sudden though, it begins several thousand years before the maximum and continues for several thousand years after. This fits nicely with the ending of the last ice age around 10-11,000 BCE. We're currently in a mid-point in the Axial tilt cycle and it's gradually approaching a cooling effect, though, at least for now, the effect of man made climate change is far bigger than the gradual Axial Tilt cooling. Axial Precession Precession is a bit more complicated. The Earth is on a 26,000 year "wobble", that moves the North Star and other stars around in a circle in the night sky, but what matters with this Milankovich cycle is what month the Earth is closest to the sun, or, at Perihelion. The change in Perihelion over time works on roughly a 21,000 year cycle, because it combines Axial precession with Apsidal precession. Currently the Earth is closest to the Sun in January, but that will gradually change and in about 10,500 years, the Earth will be closest to the Sun in July. When the Sun is closer, the Earth gets slightly warmer, so the current position of this cycle leads to milder seasons in the Northern Hemisphere (which can lead to cooling) and more extreme seasons in the Southern Hemisphere. Unlike Axial Tilt which affects both hemispheres in the same way, precession affects each hemisphere in the opposite way to the other. This, in effect either adds to Axial Tilt's effect or subtracts from it. As pointed out above, the simplest factor is that milder seasons in the Northern Hemisphere that are ice-age friendly and more extreme seasons are not. So when perihelion is in January, that somewhat cools the Earth and when it's in July it somewhat warms it. We're currently in a "cold" period of this cycle, we were in a warm one 10,500 years ago, which also times well with the end of the last ice age. This cycle is moving towards a gradual warming and more extreme Northern Hemisphere seasons currently working in opposition to the Axial tilt effect. It's cycle is roughly twice as fast and so this also ties in nicely with the 40,000 year cycle too, as these 2 periods (21,000 years and 41,000 years) are close to in sync. These two cycles are thought to be key factors in driving the greening and droughting of the Sahara desert. Article here and here. Eccentricity The Earth's orbital period and semi-major axis of it's orbit remain roughly unchanged. What changes with eccentricity is how far the focal point (the Sun is at one of the focal points of the ellipse), moves from the center of the elipse. The effect of the Earth's orbital eccentricity changing is two-fold. First, Axial precession only matters if the Earth's orbit is an ellipse. If the Earth's orbit is circular, the precession Milankovich cycle has no effect. Precession has maximum effect when the Earth's orbit is at it's most elliptical. The 2nd effect is that a more elliptical orbit means that, because planets move more slowly in their orbit when they are further from the sun (Equal areas in equal time, per Kepler's law), a more elliptical orbit means that over the calendar year, the Earth gets less sunlight because it's average distance form the sun over time is slightly higher. So, low eccentricity means slightly warmer, high eccentricity, slightly colder, even though the planet passes through an entire orbit every year, the total energy the Earth receives does drop slightly when the Earth's orbit is most eliptical. In addition, greater eccentricity amplifies the effect of the Axial precession, which when it's at it's highest, tends towards ending ice ages, so this effect operates in both directions, which is part of the reason why the 100,000 year cycle is smaller. In effect, eccentricity multiplies the effect of precession, but it has an additional effect that works in opposition to the precession ice age driver. (Does that make sense? - I can try to clean up if not). Precession and Axial Tilt can add together or cancel each other out. and there's other effects. How much sunlight is reflected off the high albedo south pole, how much sunlight warms the antarctic ocean, how strong the Atlantic current is. The entire picture is hugely complicated, but from an astronomical point of view, eccentricity is the only one that can reduce or increase total solar energy hitting the Earth. Axial tilt and precession have no effect on how much sunlight hits the earth, they only drive the variation between the seasons. 

There's a wide variety of answers for how much warning. Most of what the Near Earth Asteroid Program or focuses on is Earth Crossing Objects or Near Earth Objects. Those pose the greatest risk of impact and they are also, somewhat conveniently, the easiest to track. The hardest to track is a high eccentricity long period orbit that approaches from the sun side of the planet. Chelyabinsk was a sun side asteroid (an asteroid that hits during the day generally approaches from the sun side. Those are the hardest to see, and even though Chelyabinsk was too small to worry about (20 meters diameter estimate). It's possible that it would have been observed by the luck of having a telescope pointed in the right direction had it approached from the night side of the planet. Still, an object that size, it's unlikely that they'd have had more than a few hours warming. The larger the object, the easier it is to see and once an object is observed for some time and it's trajectory has been studied, it's path can be predicted years, even decades ahead of time. The warning time drops sharply for an object not yet observed. Potentially Hazardous Objects are at least 100 meters across, sometimes 150 meters is used as a minimum. 25-50 times the reflective surface of Chelyabinsk, so an object that size could be seen a fair bit further ahead of time. Finally, Planet X doesn't exist and if it did exist, it would have cleared it's orbital path by now and it wouldn't be sending asteroids and/or comets towards Earth once every orbit and predicting an exact date (Sept 23rd) from an unobserved planet X. That's just silly. There is stuff out there in our solar system that we haven't seen. Lots of stuff, maybe even a hundred or more unidentified dwarf planets, possibly another planet or two. (Click here for cool diagram) The thing is, orbits tend to clear out over time and our solar-system is over 4 billion years old. Most of the stuff that had an orbit that was going to crash into the Earth did so long ago and Planet Nine, assuming it exists, has cleared out it's orbit and it rarely sends stuff flying towards Earth. Space is also so big that Earth is, by comparison, a very tiny target, so an asteroid coming from the outer reaches of the solar system and hitting Earth is like shooting a hole in one from the space shutting. Stuff is far more likely to miss than hit the Earth. But to answer your question on an object coming from a distant orbit, sent our way by a theoretical planet, it's hard to say when we'd see it in that scenario if it's a brand new observation and it would also depend on whether it came towards the Earth on the sun side or the night side. (Objects can hit the Earth from any direction), but sun side observations are the hardest to see. The good news is, high eccentricity impacts of objects large enough to be considered potentially hazardous are rare enough that you are unlikely to be affected by an Asteroid Impact in your lifetime. It's somewhere around 140 on the list of things you should worry about. And low eccentricity orbits that could hit Earth, or NEOs, those are being carefully tracked. The other good news is that Planet X (if it even exists) doesn't threaten Earth. No object in distant orbit around our sun would be a threat. In fact, having a planet out there would actually send more asteroids away than it would cause to fly in towards the inner solar system. They would reduce, not increase the number of impacts, similar to Jupiter. But a large object passing through might post an asteroid/comet impact threat. Gilese 710 could do that, but it won't pass close enough to have that effect for about 1.36 million years. I don't want to make light of this. Asteroid impacts do happen and Earth may have been hit by a very destructive asteroid or comet about 12,900 years ago (the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis) and a global changing event like that might happen every, 50,000 or 100,000 years or so, which means it's 100%, absolutely worth looking out and seeing as much as possible, because Earth will get hit by a large object again. But such impacts are very rare on a human lifetime scale. But I'm not sure I ever answered your question. How much warning for a large object, say 150-250 meters? If the trajectory makes it tough to see, maybe only a few hours. If it approaches from the night side, maybe a few days or a few weeks. Longer if someone gets lucky and has a big telescope pointed in the right place, but I'm kinda guessing. As our technology improves, the warning period will increase. (I invite correction, especially on this last paragraph).
