Main question. What is the class of smooth orientable 4-dimensional manifolds that admit an almost complex structure $J$ and a vector field v, that preserves $J$? The following sub question is rewritten thanks to the comment of Robert Bryant: Is it true that if $(M,J)$ admits a vector field that preserves $J$ then there is $J'$ on $M$ homotopic to $J$ that is preserved by an $S^1$-action on $M$? After three years I don't think indeed that the following is such a reasonable motivation POSSIBLE MOTIVATION. Claire Voisin gave a construction of the Hilbert scheme of points for every almost complex 4-fold by an analogy with the Hilbert scheme of points of a complex surface. The first calculation of the Euler charactericstics of Hilbert scheme of points of complex surfaces was done via localisation techniques, for $CP^2$. Now, if we have a "holomorphic" vector field on an almost complex manifold, this could potentially help to reduce the calculation of the Euler charachteristics of its Hilbert scheme to the study of fixed points of the manifold. So the question is how flexible this notion is... But in its nature this question seems to be more a question (maybe not a hard one) on dynamical systems. 

Define $F$ as $x^2-y^2=0$, $G$ as $x^2+y^2=0$ and $H$ as $xy=0$. (here $(x:y:z)$ are homogeneous coordinates in $\mathbb P^2$.) It is clear that $H$ can not be expressed as $AF+BG$. At the same time if we take $B=0$, then $H\cdot F=B\cdot F+G\cdot F=4\cdot (0:0:1)$. 

In fact it is not true that the geodesic will shoot again the boundary. You can already construct such a contexample on a disc. First thing that you should do is to understand that if we have a hyperbolic annulus i.e. H^2/Z it has one closed geodesics and there are other (inifinite) geodesics that spriral and finally tend to the closed one. Such a geodesic is contained in a half of the cylinder. Now you can make a cut on the cylinder that will intersect the geondesic by the angle pi/ end through the rest. Finally replace the other infinite half cylinder by a disk. There are some cases when this map is a piescewise isomtetry -- there is a whole science about this topic, called interval exchange transformations. This happen for surfaces of any genus >1. It is not clear how much you can say about M if the map is well defined. For example you can take MxI -- a direct product. But in the case when the boundary of M is connetced I don't see for the moment any other example than just a standard disk D^n (say with metric of constant curvature) 

Yes, this is true. Let me consider the case when there is no linear change of coordinates $(x_1,...,x_n)$ such that $g=g(x_1,...,x_{n-1})$. In this case it is clear that the vector $v=h_1(0,...,1)$ does not belong to the plane $(x_{n+1}=0)\subset \mathbb C^{n+1}$. Hence we can find a linear transformation $h_3$ of $\mathbb C^{n+1}$ that lives invariant all lines in $\mathbb C^{n+1}$ parallel to $v$ and sends the plane $h_1((x_{n+1}=0))$ to $(x_{n+1}=0)$. This transformation leaves $h_1(f)$ invariant. Finally chose $h_2$ to be the restriction of $h_3\circ h_1$ to the plane $x_{n+1}=0$. The general case is similar. We just need to play with the largest subgroups in the group of translations of $\mathbb C^n$ that leave $f$ and $g$ invariant (respectively) - such groups are unique (and have the same dimension $0 \le dim\le n$). 

This is a notorious open problem. For the moment the simplest compact four-manifold that is announced to admit (infinite number of) exotic smooth structures is $S^2\times S^2$. This result is contained here : $URL$ I have to say that I am not at all an expert in the area (also it seems that the above paper is not yet published). On the other hand there are several published papers showing that $CP^2\sharp 3\overline{CP^2}$ admit exotic smooth structures. Also, it might be worth to recall that by a theorem of Yau a complex surface homeomrophic to $CP^2$ always has the standard smooth structure (in other words $CP^2$ admits a unique holomorphic structure up to bi-homolorphism). While for $S^2\times S^2$ this is still unknown (is there a surface of general type homeomorphic to $S^2\times S^2$?) 

The next picture shows the full phase portrait. To construct this phase portrait $19$ trajectories perpendicular to the left segment of the billiard were used. These trajectories correspond to red points in the picture. After this $19$ trajectories perpendicular to the right segment were constructed and they correspond to blue points on this picture. To get the actual picture both blue and red points were undergone small stochastic perturbations, and the perturbation for red points was slightly larger than the perturbation of blue points. As a result we can clearly distinguish the trajectories that hit the right segment perpendicularly (they are red), and we can distinguish the trajectories that hit the left segment perpendicularly (they are blue). Finally, the central symmetric trajectories are red-blue. 

Let $X$ be a complex manifold (for example $\mathbb CP^n$), let $v$ be a holomorphic vector field on $X$, and let $F$ be a coherent sheaf (for example a vector bundle or a structure sheaf of a point). Then $v$ defines an element in $Ext^1(F,F)$. Indeed $v$ generates an action of $\mathbb C$ on $X$ and taking pull-backs of $F$ under this action we get a deformation of $F$, hence an element of $Ext^1(F,F)$. Question. Is there any fancy (or not fancy) way to express the corresponding element of $Ext^1(F,F)$ in terms of $v$ and $F$? Maybe there is some construction with jets? (I understand, this is a bit vague) Added. Two equally nice and far leading answers were given to this question. I would like summarise here what I understood from David's answer in down to earth terms. So, we want to associate an extension $F\to E\to F$ to a vector field $v$. Suppose (just for the sake of been very much down to earth), that $F$ is a vector bundle, and $v$ has no zeros. Then we can consider $1$-jets of sections of $F$ in the direction of $v$ (or if you want, along trajectories of $v$). It is not hard to see that this is a bundle of rank $2rank(F)$, and this is exactly $E$, that we are looking for. 

The answer to this question is YES. I assume you want $A$ and $B$ to be connected. Already in the case of four manifolds two symplectic surfaces can have negative intersection. To construct an example, we use that if two symplectic surfaces in a $4$-fold intersect positively, you can always smoothen the neighborhood of their intersection to get a new symplectic surface. (Of course this is not always true in the algebraic case). Example. Take any symplectic 4-manifold $M$ with a symlectic surface $C$, such that $C^2=-1$ (for example $\mathbb CP^2$ blown up once). Blow up $M$ at a point of $C$ and let $E$ be the exceptional curve, while $C'$ be the proper transform of $C$. Notice that $C'^2=-2$ and $C'$ intersect $E$ positively in one point. So we can smoothen the union $C'\cup E$ (this is the full preimage of $C$ under the blow up, and we can not smooth this union algebraically) and get a surface that we call $B$. Finally we have $B\cdot C'$=$C'^2+C'\cdot E=-2+1<0$. ADDED. Smoothing. In order to smoothen $C'\cup E$ symplectically we can first chose coordinates in a local chart $U$ and adjust a bit the symplectic form so the $C'\cup E$ is given in $U$ by $zw=0$, and the symplectic form is $-i(dz\wedge d\bar z+dw\wedge d\bar w)$. Then surely the curve given by $zw=\varepsilon$ is symplectic in $U$ (since the smoothen curve is complex, while the symplectic form is Kahler). But the whole curve is now discontinuous on the boundary of $U$. To cure this we consider $zw=\varepsilon (F(|z|^2+|w|^2))$ where $F(0)=1$ in $U/2$ and $F$ is smooth with compact support. It is symplectic again, since inside $U\setminus (U/2)$ it is a little perturbation of the union of lines $z=0$ and $w=0$ 

I tried to investigate the question for some time and sent emails to several experts in the field. For the moment the conclusion seems to be the following: The statement is well known to experts, was used many times, but was never written as a lemma, propostition, or a theorem in any article, or book. The only relatively unambiguous reference that I managed to find are lines 14-0 from the bottom of page 4 in the article of Viacheslav V. Nikulin "On algebraic varieties with finite polyhedral Mori cone" that you can find here $URL$ It might be, that looking better one would be able to find an actual reference, and I would beg anyone who knows such a reference to give the answer to the question... Meanwhile I would like to formulate a beautiful (and apparently strongest) known result in this direction, that is omnipresent in the book of Alexeev and Nikulin (I would like to thank both authors for pointing out this to me), but again never stated explicitly.The name of the book is Classification of log del Pezzo surfaces of index $\le 2$, you can find it here: $URL$ Theorem, Alexeev, Nikulin. Let $S$ be a Log del Pezzo surface of index 2. Then $S$ admits a particular (possibly non-minimal) resolution of singularities so that the set of unit vectors in the Nef cone of the resolution is a hyperbolic Coxeter polytope of finite volume. Here is an explanation of the terminology. log-del Pezzo surface is a (possibly singular) rational surface with ample anti-canonical bundle. The index of such surface is the minimal number $n$ such that $nK$ is a Cartier divisor. Log del Pezzo surface of index two have only quotient singularities, isomorphic to $\mathbb C^2/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a finite group with elements with determinants $\pm 1$. The proof of the theorem is a combination of the Cone theorem (this gives the finiteness of the volume) and the following simple Observation. Suppose we have vectors $v_i$ in $\mathbb R^{1,n}$ such that $v_i\cdot v_j=0,1$, $v_i\cdot v_i=-1,-2,-4$, and $v_i \cdot v_j=0$ if $v_i\cdot v_i=-2$, $v_j\cdot v_j=-4$. Then the angles between hyperplanes orthogonal to vectors $v_i$ can be only $\pi/2$, $\pi/3$, $\pi/4$, or $0$. Finally one just needs to find an appropriate resolution of singularities of $S$.
