When we die, we no longer exist; Since we no longer exist, we can feel neither pain nor pleasure. Rather, we simple "are not"; Therefore, there is nothing to fear in death, as death literally is nothing from our perspective. 

Yes. In The Republic, the guardians are the ultimate authority, and they rely on their own virtue to maintain the state of the whole Republic. This is ultimately why the "Decay of State" occurs, wherein the perfect Aristocracy/Monarchy decays to a Timocracy, which decays to a Democracy, which ultimately collapses into a Tyranny. Though the guardians can keep the populace in order, it's impossible to make them incorruptible themselves, and especially as new guardians come along Plato points out that there is increasing room for error. Ultimately something has to go wrong somewhere in the guardian's self-regulation. There's a whole page of complete mathematical gibberish (which I will cite once I have access to my book) that Plato uses to "argue" for the inevitability of decay, which is summarized by the paraphrase "even the aristocracy will erode with time." 

In the final paragraph specifically, Nietzsche is asserting that after all we have given up for God, all the "life-denying" actions of "ressentiment", we are overcoming the illusion that we need him, and in doing so metaphorically "killing" him. Likewise, in another passage: 

The premises do not allow one to argue that the natives are not primitive. The list of premises is entirely irrelevant to its conclusion, and so the argument contains the fallacy Ignoratio Elenchi. The only way the argument could avoid being fallacious is: 

The object that experienced this first motion must have come into existence and moved. The object that experienced this first motion must have existed at rest, and then moved. 

And so on. The point is that one can continue this forever, and even with all these assumed premises one needn't accept the conclusion. Ultimately, as you say in your question, it comes down to a matter of giving up on all the technical premises and just saying "Z must be true because of the above" regardless of the hidden assumptions beneath that. 

All of those definitions will likely work for you, although the latter two may be more useful. Admittedly, this definition is not very detailed, but I think it covers "the whole, unknown universe, including both the reality (that we perceive) and the rest, the things we know and don't know or will never know" when using the definition "everything that is and has been, whether or not it is observable or comprehensible." Please tell me if this is inadequate. 

Coherentism does not require that S be non-inferential in the foundationalist sense, because it takes S as reliable by virtue of it being a valid system of belief. Of course, there is quite a bit of debate on just what it takes to validate any system of belief S, but non-inference is generally not a criteria for such validation. Thus, Bonjour's coherence theory separates it from foundationalism in that he rejects the foundationalist problem of regression and its solution of non-inference, instead defining a system of belief as the source of epistemology. I would strongly recommend the SEP's articles on Foundationalism and Coherentism for further reading. 

There is most certainly an argument to be made that in practice, everyone is sexist, racist, etc. to everyone else by virtue of being complicit in the structural imbalances which have been established in civilization. It can be argued that there's something sexist about any interaction between genders which does not seek to break down whatever barriers may exist. In practice, this renders practically any interaction sexist in either direction, because it may be that a woman's right to her voice is being implicitly suppressed, or a man's right to his emotions are being denied, or simply that a binary is being enforced on those who wish to be free of it. I realize this isn't exactly the sort of answer you're going for, but your question made me think of the article I've linked above and I hope it proves enlightening. 

An omniscient God knows everything that you will do. Therefore, God can predict your future, your actions, everything that you "choose" to do. As an example, suppose that God knows that you will do X in the future. You have not yet done X, but God somehow knows that you will, therefore it is true that you will do X. When the time comes for you to do X, although you may perceive yourself as having willed it, you actually had no choice in the matter. You had to do X because since long past, God knew you would, and the only way he could know this before is if there was some determinant to your will (e.g. physical cause-effect). Since there must have been a determinant to your will, you cannot have a free and unconstrained will. 

The common argument at this point (very similar to, if not the same as, stoicfury's answer) is something along the lines of: 

Now consider an entity Y with the same power and the property that "Y will punish any human who lives as though X exists with extreme prejudice". Both X and Y are equally likely to exist under our assumption of "all else equal" strong agnosticism. I would wager the payoff is not there. The point being that for any belief which one might live by according to some formulation of Pascal's Wager, an opposing Wager may be formulated by which one absolutely should not follow the first. It just doesn't work. 

From this, I want to expand on the idea I expressed about truth: a belief does not require awareness either. You can believe something without thinking about it, and until you are confronted with the idea, you needn't even realize that you have the belief. However, you still had the belief the whole time. Justification. As is explained in the SEP's article on epistemology (above), this is far from a simple matter. However, in the simplest view, a belief is justified when you have no obligation to believe otherwise (deontology). A more complex view is that a belief is justified when you have evidence for it (non-deontology). Although what actually qualifies as evidence is debated, what is and isn't justified does not seem to get much more complicated than having evidence. Here I want to bring my argument full circle. It would appear that every criteria for knowledge is achievable without active awareness. You can be justified in the belief that apples fall from trees on Earth either because you have no obligation to believe otherwise, or because you've seen apples falling. In either case, however, you can (as I explained about) be unaware of the belief, and by extension, the justification of the belief itself. You have evidence, but you don't think about it. 

Thus, it is Hobbes' belief (expanded upon in his writings) that it is morally required for us to relinquish some of our rights (specifically, the right to whatever we want) in order to preserve peace. If anything we desire could cause conflict, it is our moral obligation to give up our desire and pursue the greater good of peace. I think these philosophers would be useful in comparison with your personal ideas. 

Thus, it's apparent that category theory is relevant to and has implications for both mathematics and philosophy, and is not just semantic. From the perspective of mathematics, category theory is very significant because "doing mathematics in a categorical framework is almost always radically different from doing it in a set-theoretical framework." The article provides a list of philosophical results following from category theory, such as: 

Is there a consensus on whether the positional restriction changes the provability of the claim? What does the major literature have to say about this? 

Here the meritocracy of the city can clearly be seen; although a caste system exists, Socrates explicitly states that children do not have to have the same caste as their parents. If a good, wise "gold" child is born to "iron" craftsmen, the guardians will notice as they watch all the young, and will appropriately assign the child to become a guardian. People are assigned places directly based upon their merits, and nothing else. Indeed, Socrates made it clear at the genesis of the city in speech that each person should do only what they're best at, whatever that happens to be. As for some sort of testing, it too is partially articulated in 413, as Socrates talks about how guardians must be tested for strength of conviction: 

This is a negative existential claim, meaning that I am making a claim that some thing (in this case, cake) does not exist physically. Whether the "concept" of a cake exists or not in some metaphysical way is irrelevant; I am only concerned with the existence of real, delicious cake. While this is a simple claim, a huge question in epistemology is whether I can prove this or not. There are a number of ways I could go about trying to prove my statement. I could start looking around my room, under tables, in drawers, anywhere I could imagine in search of cake. I could recruit a team of volunteers with the promise of cake and set them off in search of said pastry to see if there is any to be found. I could make some sort of cake radar and plant gigantic antennas everywhere to investigate the outer reaches of space for the existence of cakes (see also SETI). However, through any of this, does contemporary philosophy hold that I can ever prove that the cake is a lie? As an aside, what about a restricted claim? What if I instead assert that: 

An omniscient God knows everything about the universe. Therefore, if you do X, then God will know that you did it in your existence. This is not in the chronological sense of you doing X and God knowing after, but in the boolean sense that because you did X, God knows it. The "mechanism" by which God knows this is his transcendence of spacetime, because he is able to look at the entire universe at all times. Therefore, God's omniscience does not restrict what you do, because he does not know it "before" (which would imply a deterministic mechanism), he just knows. 

This idea that the truth is often depressing is repeated often by Nietzsche, and something that suffuses his works is his idea that the free spirit is unhappy much more than the normal person. Although there is no mention of moral duty (Nietzsche would probably balk at the idea) or duty of any sense, there is a clear theme that Nietzsche's ideal man is far from happy (although he can experience times of pleasure). This is sort of similar to your personal philosophy, though I admit it seems much less noble (again, not really in Nietzsche's style). Hobbes Thomas Hobbes was a political philosopher who is often seen as the successor to Machiavelli; he focused on a practical and effective state as opposed to the ideal utopias of the past. In De Cive, Hobbes set the foundation for his theory of state, from which he determined what would be morally correct: 

I'm no expert, but I think you unwittingly named it yourself: Reality. A short excerpt from Wikipedia: 

This is more a linguistic question than a philosophical one (unless I've missed something in the question beyond a purely definitional "what is a verb and is 'is' one?") In semantics we treat the copula as semantically vacuous: it doesn't add any meaning. In lambda notation, it is "lambda x. x". Thus, when deriving the semantics of "the ball is blue", "is blue" collapses to just "blue", which is usually treated as a set, and the meaning of the sentence becomes "the ball is a member of the set of blue things". The only exception I can think of is the floating existential is, as in "the world is", in which case one would use the lexical entry that means the same thing as "exists". But this is a different use of the word. In syntax, when a language has a copula (most languages don't), it occupies the head of the verb phrase because as a part of speech is considered to be a verb. Thus, as far as linguistics is concerned (and correct me if I'm mistaken in taking this question to be one of linguistics), is is a verb. 

First, it's important to avoid the not-so-uncommon misinterpretation that Nietzsche is saying God once was but no longer is: Nietzsche is definitely not saying that something happened to God as an entity (according to Nietzsche, God never existed), but rather that we have done something to God as an idea. Specifically, we have abandoned the idea of God, hence "killed" him, much as we would say "you are dead to me" to someone we no longer care the slightest about - though again, Nietzsche doesn't think God was ever real as an entity. To Nietzsche, this is an inevitable step in the timeline of civilization. He claims that we both created God and are bound to destroy him, and furthermore that this latter event is on the horizon. Note this passage: 

Plato The philosopher who first occurred to me when I thought about this question was Plato. In The Republic, Plato describes a city in speech to examine "what is just," along with other major ethical (and sometimes metaphysical) questions. To rule this city, he assigns certain particularly educated and wise people called "guardians" to lead over their people and maintain justice with totalitarian authority. However, Plato points out that these guardians must never be corrupted. Thus, he determines that they must give up all private property and live in community bunkers so that their sole interest is in their people (an obvious parallel with Communism here, just an interesting note). They will have live with no luxury and the bare minimum of supplies. To this declaration, Adeimantus complains: 

The Maxim of Quantity: give as much information as is required, and no more The Maxim of Quality: don't say anything you believe is false, or for which you lack adequate evidence The Maxim of Relation: be relevant in what you say (nice weather, eh?) The Maxim of Manner: speak clearly
