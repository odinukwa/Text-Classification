In the absence of inflation, the social cost of creating a dollar is essentially zero (at most a few cents worth of paper and ink), but the private cost of holding a dollar is a forgone dollar's worth of consumption. Therefore there must be positive externalities to holding dollars. Inflation increases the private cost without changing the social cost, so magnifies the externality. Moreover, because there's an externality even when inflation is zero, the additional welfare loss due to the first marginal unit of inflation is already non-zero. This external cost is the same as the shoe-leather costs that FooBar mentions, but thinking about it as an externality lets you measure it as a triangle and so helps toward quantifying it. 

Because we use today's capital stock to produce tomorrow's output, some fraction of which is invested, so you should expect something like $dK/dt=\alpha f(K)$ where $f$ is increasing in $K$. 

There are two completely separate reasons why you shouldn't think of stocks as Giffen goods. Alecos has very nicely explained the first reason. The other is that consumer theory --- maximization subject to a budget constraint --- does not apply to financial assets, because here there is in principle no budget constraint. That is, there's a limit to how much you can borrow for a trip to Hawaii, but there's no limit in principle to how much you can borrow to buy assets that throw off income. Note that the whole theory of Giffen goods --- the Slutsky equation, etc. --- relies on the budget constraint. That's exactly why there are no Giffen factors of production, even in theory. So Alecos's point is that to call a stock a "Giffen good", you'd have to demonstrate an upward sloping demand curve holding quality constant. The point here is that to make sense of a stock as a "Giffen good" you've got to have a budget constraint. So even if you ignore Alecos's point entirely, there is still no chance for a financial asset to be a Giffen good. 

It depends on the context, of course, but most often in policy analysis "the value of a life" has nothing (directly) to do with output, etc, but instead means the maximum amount that people would want the government to spend in order to save a randomly chosen life. So in a country of 300,000,000, the question is: What, to you, is the monetary equivalent of a 1/300,000,000 chance of death? Because 1/300,000,000 is a very small number, we don't have to worry terribly much about willingness-to-pay versus willingness-to-accept. (Theory tells us that for small changes, the two willingnesses are effectively equal.) Returning to the question: How much would you be willing to pay to avoid a 1/300,000,000 chance of death? Now multiply that value by 300,000,000. That's the value of one life, and arguably the amount we'd want our government to spend to preserve a randomly chosen life. Obviously there are problems with heterogeneity (you and I might not answer the question identically). But as a general rough rule, the estimates tend to come in somewhere under $10 million. 

Essentially, there was a bank run in the repo market. The repo market is where big institutions (like, say, Fidelity) deposit large amounts of cash for short periods of time with institutions like, say, Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns, in order to guarantee that it won't run away with the money, allows Fidelity to hold some valuable assets belonging to Bear Stearns in the meantime --- say some bonds. Now Fidelity comes to believe that these bonds are worth only, say, 80% as much as it previously believed, and therefore asks for more bonds by way of collateral. So, at around the same time, does everyone else. But Bear Stearns only owns so many bonds, so it can't satisfy everyone. If you've ever seen "It's A Wonderful Life", you know what happens next. That, at least, is Gary Gorton's story, and it seems very plausible and is widely endorsed. Of course there are many competing stories as well. 

Harry Johnson frequently applied euclidean geometry to trade theory and growth theory. Have a look at his many papers and books. For a more or less randomly chosen starting point, try his "Trade and Growth: A Geometrical Exposition". 

Suppose I define "net appliances" as dishwashers plus appliances lent to others minus appliances borrowed from others. Suppose I build a refrigerator and lend it to you. Then your "net appliances" have been reduced by one, my "net appliances" have increased by one, and the total of the world's "net appliances" has not changed. On the other hand, the world does now have one more refrigerator, which suggests that "net appliances" was never a very interesting notion in the first place. 

You are certainly wrong regarding surplus, which is measured in dollars, not in units of welfare. In particular, according to the definition you've given, surplus depends on the choice of welfare function $W$, whereas in fact surplus is independent of that choice (and indeed the concept of surplus makes perfectly good sense in the absence of any welfare function at all.) (There are of course issues involving income effects that add a little ambiguity to the notion of surplus, but those issues are not, I think, relevant to what you're asking.) Regarding welfare, personally I use the word interchangeably with surplus, and I am pretty sure many others do also. Unfortunately, the same word is also often used to mean "value of the social welfare function" (which of course requires a social welfare function to have been chosen). So, as with so many other words, it can be important to clarify which meaning you have in mind. 

There is no domestic interest rate; there is a world interest rate. What you presumably mean to ask is: How is that a change in the world interest rate, caused by a change in domestic supply or demand, increases capital inflow? Answer: Because the foreign supply and demand for output are being held constant, an increase in the interest rate leads foreigners to produce more and consume less. The excess has to go somewhere, i.e. it has to be lent to a non-foreigner, i.e. to a domestic citizen. 

This is in response to your new edit, and hence completely separate from my earlier answer. The public debt does not contribute negatively to the government's "net money", because whenever the government borrows a dollar, it implicitly promises to raise future taxes by (the present value of) that dollar in order to eventually pay down the debt. Thus it has, in effect, lent a dollar to the taxpayers (who receive government services today but won't be billed for them till later). So every dollar borrowed from bondholders is offset by a dollar loaned to taxpayers. This means that the government's net money is exactly equal to the government's cash holdings. It remains the case that "net money" is an entirely silly thing to be thinking about in the first place, but as long as you insist on thinking about it, you'll want to get this right. 

If one person decides to reduce his lifetime consumption by (say) \$100, then someone else (or many someone else's) is made richer by \$100. For example, that $100 might be left to a single heir. Or at the other extreme, the person might decide to burn a \$100 bill in which case the benefits are spread to everyone who holds money. When people are richer, they can decide to consume more, or to work less, or some of each. Because income elasticities of labor supply are empirically quite small, you'd expect most of this to come out in increased consumption. 

1) Debt matters because it smoothes (or unsmoothes) taxes over time, which matters because the deadweight loss from taxation is (roughly) proportional not to the tax rate, but to the square of the tax rate. 2) Because family sizes are not homogeneous, government debt (which transfers the tax burden to future generations) can redistribute the tax burden across families. (Think, for example, about a taxpayer with no kids, or a family that has just immigrated.) 3) Government debt makes it easier to borrow --- it's better to pay 3% to government bondholders than 18% to your credit card company. This is possible because the penalty for not paying your taxes is considerably more severe than the penalty for not paying your credit card bill. (In effect, government debt resurrects the institution of the debtor's prison.) 4) There are of course issues with misperceptions, where debt can make people feel either richer or poorer than they really are, depending on whether they underestimate or overestimate their future tax burdens, and so can affect consumption paths in either direction. 

Money is produced at zero social cost but held at a positive private cost (because to hold money you must forgo holding other assets). Therefore there is a positive externality from holding money, which means that the usual arguments for subsidizing it apply. This makes the optimal rate of inflation negative (because inflation is a tax on holding money). In fact if you add a few details to the above argument, it's easy to see that the optimal rate of inflation is minus the real rate of interest. On the other hand, funding the government is likely to require departing from an optimal tax system in which everything is taxed (or subsidized) according to the externalities it creates. Presumably the optimal departure entails higher taxes on most things, including money holding, which means that the optimal inflation rate should be somewhere north of $-r$. Whether it's north of zero is less clear.
