One reason is that hanging is regarded to be one of the more disgraceful ways to kill a person, normally reserved for petty criminals, while beheading or shooting was regarded to be more 'honorable'. In a notable case, Admiral John Byng was executed by firing squad, after having been judged guilty of 'not having done his utmost' in the Battle of Minorca. This stands in contrast to the ordinary seamen of the same time period, who were hung when found guilty of a capital crime: desertion, striking a superior officer. In the aftermath of Operation Valkyrie, the July 20 plot against the Nazis, Hitler ordered that the conspirators be 'hanged like cattle'. Many of the more prominent conspirators weren't just hanged, they were hanged with piano wire and no drop, to increase the agony. This resulted in slow strangulation, supposedly taking a few hours. Ironically, the Nazis who were given the death penalty at the Nuremburg trials were all hung, even after the military members specifically requested a firing squad. It was a final, contemptuous gesture. 

Even as far back as the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, in pre-firearm times, metal body armor turned out to be a drawback, not a benefit. Thanks in part to the sea of mud in the battlefield, the armored French knights on foot were slowed up, and the powerful Welsh longbow could penetrate main armor at 20-30 yards, or appendage (arm, leg) armor at up to 200 yards. The slow moving French foot soldiers were slaughtered because they couldn't get close enough to Henry's longbowmen to employ their swords. The French mounted cavalry wearing very heavy armor often drowned in the mud when the arrows hit their horses and they fell off. A mounted knight, once dismounted, was pretty much immobile, due to the extreme weight of their armor. The key here was the introduction of a powerful weapon that could strike at a distance with enough force to penetrate wearable metal armor, thus invalidating the primary reason for armor: protection against a sword or spear at close range. As Agincourt showed, a fast moving unarmored soldier with a long range weapon handily bested a slower moving armored soldier. The introduction of the musket, that could do what the longbow could do but with far less training, finally obsoleted metal body armor. However... personal armor has made a comeback in the last 30 or so years, thanks to lightweight composite armor that can resist the typical rifle bullet. Most of the advanced militaries today equip their foot soldiers with body armor, and that is one reason that casualties have dropped for the more modern militaries. 

Brokers went bust due to an aspect of investing that isn't often covered by mainstream media: the margin call. When you buy stocks on margin, meaning you're borrowing the money to buy a lot of the stocks, who puts up the rest of the money? The broker. Buy $10k worth of stock at the 15% margin allowable in the 1920's, and you only paid $1500. So if it goes up in price, you get 100% of the increased price. Wow, isn't that great? But, if it goes down below what you paid the 15% on, you eat 100% of the loss, and you're expected to pay the difference right now so the broker doesn't lose their equity. That's the margin call... in those days, it was literally a call from the broker you didn't want to get. If your $10k of stock you only put up $1500 for drops to $8k, you now owe your stockbroker another $2k, and you get nothing for that $2k, just the stock you thought you owned. You do have that $2k, don't you? Or did you buy more stock on margin with that, figuring you'd cash in even more? Oops, looks like you'll have to sell off some of your other stock to make that margin call, only your other stock has just plunged in value, so you have margin calls on that, too. This worked well as long as a lot of people were pouring money into the market and it kept going up. It doesn't work well if the stock prices drop. That tends to spook margin investors into selling everything just to limit their losses, especially if they only put up 15% to buy in but are on the hook for 100% if the price drops. And if the market in general consists mostly of margin investors, as it did in the 1920's, even a small overall stock drop can spook a lot of people into selling, which accelerates the price drop because there aren't that many buyers... If you wonder why some investors even today will sell stock that slips just a little, that's one reason why. They bought on a 50% margin, and want to limit their losses. So that's what happened in 1928... prices started to drop, people started selling to cover their margin calls, no one was buying, the price really dropped, even more margin calls. You, who put up $1500 for $10k of stock that's only worth $1k now, don't have $9k, so you default on your broker. And your broker... um... went broke because most of their clients couldn't make good on the margin calls. Add in the fact that the 1920's broker was getting their money that they loaned you by borrowing on their stocks (which were also highly inflated in value), and the whole thing became a house of cards that collapsed, because there wasn't nearly the hard currency backing the market up that everyone thought there was. To a degree, this was mirrored in the 2007 real estate crash. Inflated prices, speculators borrowing beyond their means, and when real estate prices plummeted, the banks and investment houses that put up the mortgage expect you to pay the difference between what they loaned and what the house is now worth (it's in the mortgage agreement, in the fine print), and you don't have that money. 

One German super weapon that didn't quite make it was the Type XXI Electro-Boat It's high underwater speed and endurance meant it could move faster than surface ships could hunt it. However, the XXI was plagued with development difficulties, and only one made it to an actual war patrol, in the last week of the war. The design was so advanced that the Soviets used it as the basis for their Whiskey class diesel-electric submarines, and the XXI hull design was used for the first nuclear sub, the USS Nautilus. But, even that had problems. Dr John Craven was tasked with studying the Nautilus, and reports in his book The Silent War, that it had serious cavitation problems with its ballast tanks when traveling at speed under water, so much so that the cavitation was tearing the outer hull apart. The USN was able to solve that problem, and eventually went to a teardrop shape that was even more efficient than the XXI design. Would the XXI have reversed the battle of the Atlantic, had it been available in sufficient numbers? Probably not. Late in the war, the Allies were relying more on aircraft launched from baby carriers and the FIDO homing torpedo to attack German submarines. As fast as the XXI was, it wasn't faster than an aircraft or a torpedo. The XXI would have caused problems for a few months before they would have been countered by new Allied tactics. In the end, the super weapons had little effect on the outcome of the war, and probably were a drawback, as they consumed resources out of proportion to the results they returned. WW2 was essentially a war of attrition and supply, one that the US and USSR, with their vast resources of materials and people, would inevitably win. 

Galileo lived under the rule of the church in Italy, and counted himself as a devout Catholic. Copernicus lived in Prussia/Poland, whose government did not have direct ties to the Catholic church, and it was a region where the Lutheran/Protestant church was prominent. The Catholic church did not press charges against Copernicus, because they were not in a position to do so. 

MacArthur's defense of the Philippines on Dec 7 was terrible. Unlike Pearl Harbor, which was thought to be un-attackable at that time (until the IJN showed what could be done with carrier forces), MacArthur's command was well within range of conventional Japanese forces and the likely target of a Japanese attack. However, at that early stage of the war, the US needed heroes, not losers, so MacArthur was 'rehabilitated' as a hero, and made the US commander of army forces in the Pacific, while Admiral Kimmel, the commander of Pearl Harbor, fell on his sword and took the blame. In all fairness, most of the US was unprepared, physically and psychologically, for the war. Your charge that he was out of favor with the US government has no basis in fact. Two offensives were contemplated to cut Japan off from its supply of oil, Formosa (favored by Nimitz) and the Philippines (favored by MacArthur). Roosevelt chose MacArthur's plan, so he certainly couldn't have been out of favor in the 1944-1945 period when the atomic bomb was made reality. If MacArthur wasn't informed about the atomic bomb until shortly before its use, it is probably because he had no need to know, because his forces were nowhere near where the bomb would be used, while Nimitz had quite a few forces in the general vicinity of some of the potential targets, subject to potential fallout. The Manhattan project operated on a strictly need to know basis. This was not a sign of favor or disfavor, more an indication of just how secret the project was kept. MacArthur was not dismissed for 'plotting a coup'. He was dismissed for publicly contradicting the commander in chief. That is the fate of any high ranking general who is seen to criticize their chain of command. Stanley McCrystal, a brilliant general who had done very well in Afghanistan, was dismissed when private comments he made disparaging Obama were leaked. Trivia story: during WW1, a US unit was subject to a particularly intense German shelling. Two officers did not take cover, staring each other down to see who would flinch first. Neither did, and both survived unharmed, by luck. One of the two officers was Douglas MacArthur. The other was George Patton.
