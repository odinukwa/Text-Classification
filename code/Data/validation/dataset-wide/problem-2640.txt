Consider your first scenario. You question if an instantaneous state can lead to good outcomes. The answer a Consequentialist will tell you is no. There are no good outcomes where time for reasoning is not allowed. Consider your second and third scenario (which are inverse propositions). A consequentialist will tell you it depends. The length of time do not affect the amount of possible outcomes, because the possible inputs are infinite at any point of time. Thus, at any point of time, use the greatest possible information that are relevant to the consideration in mind. Keep in mind the difference between 2 things. There is the point of time in which you choose as your 'function'. And there is the amount of inputs, which ranges. However, at any one point of time, you are given only one set of inputs and a specific evaluative criteria, taken from the point of view of an actor. If in that shorter period of time leads to worser outcomes than the longer period of time, both using the same set of criteria to evaluate the value of outcomes, then a Consequentialst will not go ahead with that action. Again, it depends on what criteria you use to evaluate the outcomes. Some consequentialists will say it is greater happiness, some will say it is greater security. Your outcome will depend on this evaluative criteria. If the consequences in the longer period of time justifies and overrides the negative consequences in the shorter period of time, then the consequentialist will go ahead with it. Consider your fourth scenario. You consider groups. You cannot simply add the inputs together because the evaluative criteria (the equation) changes. How would a consequentialist deal with this? Ignore the individual actors totally and consider the group. Determine the evaluative criteria and inputs possible for this group that you choose, and draw the function. You will get the answer. The questions you raise are not new to Consequentialism as a moral theory. There are mainly two types: 'Act' and 'Rule'. Act consequentialism says that the rightness of the act depends on what the individual knows at that point of time, and choose optimally upon. Rule consequentialism says that it is the group's, or more complete information, that should determine the rightness of acts. This is the subjectivist vs. objectivist concern. 

Preamble Your fears are regrettably well-founded. Unlike mathematical logic, the philosophy of language is not so clear cut and remains to this day a deeply controversial topic. There are a dozen schools of thought on the philosophy of language, both classical and contemporary. It is a fundamental and unquestionably significant field of philosophical inquiry, but unfortunately what appears as a stream of simple concepts that should be amenable to science soon reveals itself as an inconsistent web of increasingly intricate questions and facts rapidly give way to opinions. The philosophy of language divided, and continues to divide, the analytic philosophers—who are known for their predilection for rigour, valid method and proof. While I would love to hand you a shiny Cambridge or Springer text in the philosophy of language, I am afraid there is no definitive work. There are commentaries and historical discussions but these will not suffice at all. What I recommend instead is this: if you are sufficiently intrigued and if you have the time to spare, read through the texts I have listed below, which come straight from the field's most significant philosophers themselves. For if it is not possible to find an objective and rigorous account of something, one must build an internal consensus for themselves, generating an objective account from a rigorous treatment of the intersubjective account. Some essential texts Gottlob Frege - On Sense and Reference 

In order to answer the question and find a satisfactory solution, it is not possible to consider only disparate problematic scenarios. You have to get down to comparing and ask linearly for instance, why a group's impression of a scenario should triumph over the individual's. Or why the greatest happiness principle should take precedence over other principles. It will lead you to other moral questions, and you have to argue for why they are so, positively, not why they should not be, negatively. 

In order for it to be a critique, it must address a very foundational part of of the theory. However, you have posited a hypothetical which in itself questionable. In fact, a pure concept. Ask yourself, where do the parts of the mechanized factory come from? Who extracted the resources that built those parts? Marx will say that the question of labor is not diminished. This is not a critique. 

Foucault has clearly moved away from a phenomenological perspective if he now concerns himself with the meaning of a sign or a fact such as madness, and how that sign is defined by cultural and political agendas, rather than possessing an objective definition. Concurrently Foucault addresses the impossibility of an objective definition for such a term that is not intrinsically biased. 

The difference is essentially the same as that which Gottlob Frege discusses in his seminal work On Sense and Reference. Putnam essentially uses the word meaning in place of Frege's sense, presumably because it seemed more intuitive for Putnam to splinter reference from meaning rather than make meaning a redundant term in our language. The distinction between meaning and reference is simple: meaning/sense is the intension or the word, name or symbolic representation of an object; the reference is the thing to which the intension corresponds in the world—the reference is the object to which you are referring, if you will. For instance, if you think of a battery, you have the word battery and you have symbols for batteries, such as: 

Your question leads directly to 2 important considerations. First, whether the physical laws we discover through science are merely 'resemblances' - that they reflect but are not actual natural realities; and Second, that the laws of physics do reflect physical content or constituents themselves as it is like in nature. This in turn depends on your own metaphysical view of what is possible to be known by the human senses. The problem with the term 'Laws of Nature' that is often used in science today (or in textbooks) is that it is a misleading way of putting what in actuality are our best theories. These theories are what, after multiple tests and confirmations, verified as they are separately in experiments, are considered to be true because they give us the best results. They are not considered final. In this sense, 'Laws' as they are used, are actually tentative theories, they are not the final say in any descriptions of reality. This is because even the most well tested and described laws, such as Newton's Laws of Motion and gravitation, have limits. For instance, after Einstein, the laws do not give predictable results at high speeds or small quantities. Thus, Laws can never be Laws in our modern sense of certainty because they are incomplete. They raise further questions about physical phenomena that require further experimentation and testing. These questions are raised when we synthesize it with other laws that we know from other experiments, or from before. For example the recent discovery of the Hiigs Boson can be considered a result that has been built upon not just our knowledge of quantum mechanics, but also our understanding of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. The lack of a unifying theory does not mean that we do not understand nature. Often, we are dependent on these theories to built upon our understanding of reality and nature. It is fundamentally important then to distinguish between the metaphysical question of whether nature can really be discovered as it is by our senses, and whether there are laws of nature that are scientific theories to be discovered through experimentation, that are dependent on our senses. 

I can imagine that it may often be difficult for responses on philosophy.stackexchange to be correctly called 'answers' since there must always be room for interpretation and evaluation in philosophical matters, but allow me to give you my views on your question and from it perhaps you will be able to discover an answer for yourself if not for everyone. Continental philosophy has profoundly—albeit misguidedly—influenced art, literature and film throughout the world. Analytic philosophy has inspired developments in mathematics and computer science, shaped the scientific method, and informed quantitative approaches to psychology and sociology. Both branches have elicited developments in linguistics. What continental philosophy has not done is continue developing in its original spirit; even since Sartre, continental philosophy has rather begun to regress or become blended with analytic flavours, with such notions as embodiment blending ideas from Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and others. Conversely, analytic philosophy has continued developing in the same way but in increasingly insignificant increments as it gradually cedes much of its original lines of inquiry to the sciences. This is the primary distinction between the two branches of philosophy: analytic philosophy walks hand in hand with science and scientism; continental philosophy focuses on the poetic and metaphysical understanding of the world. Analytic philosophy divides the world into subject and object; continental philosophy seeks to unite observer and observed to reach a fundamental and unbounded picture of both. Analytic philosophy seeks to simplify philosophy through demarcation, whilst continental philosophy is concerned with questions that are intuitively more fundamental even than science or logic. Analytic philosophy might be said to have had the more profound influence in contemporary academic circles, but what does that actually mean? Analytic philosophy has no purpose, because its goals are either impossible or fall to scientific endeavours to complete. Continental philosophy has arguably seen less academic attention (or at least less academic understanding/improvement) but the ideas of phenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction have disseminated globally and inspired vast amounts of creative work—though often the ideas are distorted or misinterpreted in such works, as is usually the case when an academic concept reaches the populace. Judging which branch of contemporary philosophy has had the more profound influence will depend on what you personally think is more profound: the sciences or the humanities. Or perhaps not, if you think as I think: that analytic philosophy is not philosophy at all, but rather an auditing process for scientific enterprise. Continental philosophy represents, to me, a truer philosophy, especially through Heidegger and the break with the Cartesian tradition of subject/object opposition and through Derrida's subsequent refinement of destruktion as deconstruction. Within the academic discipline of philosophy itself, it is difficult to judge which branch had the more profound impact. Philosophy finds itself in troubled water these days, unsure of whether it is a science or an art; you will find academics undertaking scientific studies of a psychological/neurological character calling it philosophy, and likewise you will find people still agonising over Aristotle, Chrysippus, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, and so on—and as Derrida certainly demonstrated, no philosophers will truly lose their significance, because their ideas were defined and remain defined by their opposition to each other and to the times, and that these definitions are traces of a genealogy of meaning that will not end. We might say that Continental philosophy affirms philosophy as a subject and gives it life, paves the way for future study and creation. In contrast, analytic philosophy might be said to be less constructive, narrowing philosophy down according to scientific standards over which philosophy ought to preside. I do not mean to say that analytic philosophy is only logical positivism, but analytic philosophers do not do what philosophers must by definition do: question themselves and their methods. 

I'm just getting seriously into Nietzsche. What I can answer in response to your question is that you might want to look to the Presocratics for answers. Nietzsche was a philologist, and his specialty was in linguistics. He admired the Presocratics (and the Sophists) and despised Plato. If he might refer to in any ancient society, it will most likely be Greek society. However, I think it is more important not to conflate Nietzsche's ideas with historical facts. In many cases he uses words interchangably to denote the same thing. For instance, he often uses the word 'Jew' or 'Jewish ideas' to denote what is essentially Judeo-Christain ideas and moral philosophy. They have nothing to do with the people per se. Thus, if you try to find a resemblance to facts in reality to what he writes, you run the risk of mis-interpreting him. One important thing in that passage you referred to is that he is simply relating ideas of 'purity' to certain physical activities in primitive man (or humans). It need not refer to any group or society. What he is saying is that notions or concepts of purity stem from a certain physical fear of unhygienic-ness or dirt. It has nothing to do with a priori concepts of 'pure' or perfection, which is what Christain moral philosophy posits. In other words, Nietzsche is saying that there is a biological/social origin to these concepts which, after many generations, got lost and became thought of as pure by later society, which have forgotten or misconstrued where it originated from. That is the purpose of the genealogy, to link concepts of pure, perfect, the moral uprighteousness that is an intrinsic part of christian moral philosophy, and to undermine it by linking it to an intrinsically biological/social process, that over time, was inverted from what it initially was: a fear of the dirty, unclean etc. - a very primitive, raw human basis from where it came from. 

This indicates already that to be any of these things, you need to think for yourself and you need to think in a certain way. Your thinking needs to become structured, not to preclude novel, out of the box approaches to problems but to enable you to understand what you are learning in your own terms, rather than simply memorising somebody else's terms. The Socratic Method is ideal because, as I said, as an instructor you will appeal to your students to think about how to solve a problem and the only way they will arrive at the correct answer is to think like a philosopher, computer scientist or mathematician. The further advantage with the Socratic Method is that you will require your students to justify their answer, so even if they happen on the correct answer or a strong thesis, they have to understand why it is correct or strong in order to be right. Thus when a student gives an incorrect answer, you reply with an explanation of the flaws in their logic and they will have a blueprint for how to improve; when a student answers correctly, they are made aware of the fact that their thinking was correct and that they should refine and apply their way of thinking to future questions. In epistemological terms, you can view the Socratic Method as a way of embedding procedural knowledge in your students, rather than making them memorise propositional knowledge. In computer science terms, you are giving students imperative knowledge rather than declarative knowledge. You are not just feeding them definitions and rules from which they would be lucky to intuit the abstract nature of the subject at hand; you are not even just giving them a recipe or an instruction set leading to the correct answer for them to analyse. You are making the students think about how to formulate such a recipe and inviting them to challenge rules, to play Devil's advocate, all for the purpose of being wrong. Obviously some people possess natural talents, truly intuitive grasps of subjects like mathematics, but the Socratic Method appeals to all students. It refines the students who are already adept and it brings the uninitiated up to speed by forcing them to make mistakes. If we do not grasp something intuitively, we learn by trial and error, and what better way to force trial and error than to ask your students to give answers before being comprehensively shown how to answer? They will make mistakes and they will learn from them. Once you have students thinking for themselves, you can expect for your students to eventually challenge you—the definition of a great teacher according to Aristotle: 

Update: Regarding the first scenario, there is a school of thought, 'Intuitionists', who will say that instantaneous states do not lead to worser outcomes because one can consider past experiences as helpful to making decisions. 

Empirically, no. In our imaginations, yes. That is essentially what you have referred to in the conception by children from images and symbols which seem to refer to their existence. You cannot prove an ideal conception conceived purely from objects situated in reality. For one could almost conceive of any imaginary object if we put them together. Consider what David Hume says, that there is a difference between 'matters of fact' and 'relations of ideas', in Chapter 4 in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. To simplify, matters of fact are things that, no matter what word we assign to it, are true in this world because they exist. They are established by evidence, which in turn are presaged upon 'cause and effect'. Relations of ideas are when, based on certain ideas we hold in our mind, establish them to be true by the mere thought of it. This includes mathematical and geometrical ideas, but also ideas we put together from different 'matters of fact'. That is, things that we hold true from evidence. So Santa Claus is a combination of many ideas from evidence put together as an imaginary whole. The idea of a man in a red costume, with his moose and a some 'human' looking elves, are taken from real life. We distort this picture by making this man and his moose fly, jumping into the chimneys of houses, carrying a host of goods into them (even apartments without chimneys), and give him a sense of humor. This is the imaginary picture we transmit to children, through word-of-mouth and images we draw and enact, therefore to them, there is a possibility that this imaginary figure is real, given that the empirical evidence was not told to them truthfully, but turned into a festive season made real. 

Peter Singer is a preference utilitarian as he expounds in his famous book, Practical Ethics. The author of the first document you cited also defines Mr. Singer as a preference utilitarian: 

Derrida generally resisted labels, and in particular he resisted the label of post-structuralism because his ideas were derived from structuralism—différance arising from Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistics—and, in point of fact, deconstruction only makes sense as long as it forms an extension of the structuralist approach, i.e. is within the bounds of a structuralist conceptual framework. For Derrida, structuralism was not completely wrong, it just had limitations like every other school of thought. Without structuralism, Derrida's work does not make a great deal of sense. By saying that deconstruction is antistructuralist he is essentially creating a binary opposition between structuralism and deconstruction, and so it would never be post-structuralist, because it depends on its opponent; even if it does dismantle and criticise structuralism, without structuralism it is nothing. Appending would imply that structuralism was dead and buried, but this would be the last thing Derrida would say. Indeed, I imagine he would have rejected the use of for any school of thought in philosophy, because it would imply that what came before was irrelevant or inferior, which would stand in opposition to his idea that philosophy is essentially a genealogy, a taxonomy of ideas in which every idea or school of thought is significant and serves to define its precedents and antecedents. 

I would like to answer your question directly and succintly. First, you need to start reading a lot. Philosophy helps in that, it presents arguments that requires you to dissect those parts of the proposition, and reconsider it. Read introductory books on critical thinking, philosophy, but also expand your horizons and see what is going on in current affairs. This is because most of the fallacies are out there in the media, that often present a biased point of view, subtly or covertly. Second, discuss with people good in understanding arguments. Not just any person who is familiar with philosophy or critical thinking, because such a person may not be a good arguer, or someone who understands argument. Third, practice. With increasing practice breeds familiarity, and you will be good over time naturally. Doing nothing leads to no improvement and subsequently, nothing.
