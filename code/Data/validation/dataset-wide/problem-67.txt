On reflection I say "no" as well. To begin with, we can relax some of your assumptions. For example, viral reservoirs exist other than in wildlife (herpes uses the nervous system where we don't yet have a means of eradication but other virii use bone marrow where we are starting to have such a means). A period of asymptomatic infection (to allow spreading) followed by sudden death probably won't hinder postmortem diagnosis and discovery of the pathogen or slow down R&D into treatments once it's identified (it might even make it easier to find as it will be fairly clear there is a pathogen to locate and probably which organs it can be found in). Mutation is a double (or triple) sided problem for your would-be genocide. It creates variants of a virus but says nothing about how likely the variants are to have similar effects or succumb to similar treatments (some pathogens keep key proteins fairly stable as they mutate, which is good for vaccines, in others like the common cold the mutation is in prime areas for targeting which makes those areas unreliable markers for a response). Also if the virus is too artificial and perfected, perhaps variants will be more successful in the sense of spreading, but not in lethality - a pathogen 'measures' 'success' by (and favours) replication above host death - the genocide may wish host death but if a milder mutation spreads more successfully then it will prevail in a moderately short time (some years to some decades, perhaps a few centuries at most), which has happened to several diseases. Additionally if it's too finely tuned to target human lethality then the parts of its DNA/RNA which do so are likely to be quite superfluous for virus replication (they don't have a replication promoting function) and this has two problematic effects: in any mutation they won't have any reason to be favoured for survival and will more easily be lost or lose functionality, and being human engineered hey are possibly quite precise in function (as many human creations are) - that's quite a problem for a virus intended to be lethal, since minor changes are more likely to cause them to lose the edge of design they have, or to"break" something and therefore to not to have the desired effect at all. So perhaps we try a different approach. We might look for a "base" pathogen to work with, whose replication can be made highly dependent on some specific aspect of mammalian biology (much easier to accept collateral loss of a class/clade than to find some core biology that's extremely distinctive in humans). In this case its replication is deliberately tied to its lethality, because replication involves successful metabolism of some protein or cell-type which is ideally a small part of the human body and where damage/loss is lethal to human life. For example - and I'm reaching here because this isn't my field - a ferrophilic virus whose replication is tied in with breaking up of haemoglobin, or iodine, or which can somehow cross the blood-brain barrier or affects ATP metabolism or the energy cycle, or whose replication occurs in nerve cells where it can replicate with impunity. But essentially this is a generic description of many lethal virii, and despite this none have gone the "destroy all people" route yet. Even the worst plagues with zero medical/scientific knowledge and zero hygiene haven't come close. Many virii are extremely lethal when they first "find" humans (syphillus, flu, bubonic plague, ebola) yet none came close to the effect sought here. All (except possibly the recently discovered ebola) also became milder over time as well, effectively exchanging massively acute impact for duration of host lifespan/spreading potential. The natural processes of pathogen/target/vector/mutation tends to heavily load the dice against this kind of effect (if it could, it would already). Its true that some entire species have been killed by pathogens (including some trees, not just mammals) but it seems other factors including the scale of response may have played a part in this, for example diseases of trees and wild animals don't get medical responses and knowledge rapidly piling in during an acute crisis anything like a human disease would get. Returning to our pathogen. Suppose we do tie replication success to lethality at the start. Then we need to look at how it replicates beyond its host. The problem here is you want 2 contradictory things - extreme replication and extreme host lethality. If both were easy to obtain then syphillus/flu/smallpox/measles would have killed us all long before the concept of pathogens arose. All mutated into milder, more successful, replicators. The ones that are massive replicators and also lethal (cholera being one) are slower and in some cases symptomatically treatable. Even indirect routes (water borne virii, destruction of some crucial part of the human food chain) won't help much - water and air can be filtered for virii, and foodstuffs (plant or animal) can be captive bred in virus-free facilities. One possible target might be the CO2->O2 cycle (virii that affected photosynthesising plankton/algae/plants) but such organisms are very widely spread and have survived geological time of pathogens, I don't think your genocide would have a hope of doing in the foreseeable future, something which 3 billion years of viral warfare has completely failed to do. That's without considering other practical issues for a pathogen, such as near-universal exposure and assuming near-zero immunity, and ignoring completely non-vaccine responses such as quarantine and isolated land masses. Stepping outside the box, in theory there is a small loophole open, if you can find a way to deliberately infect all people at once. This approach sees the issue as one of vector not pathogen (finding a lethal pathogen is easy, finding one that can kill everyone too quickly to respond to is very hard, perhaps we could "rethink" the problem into "given a virus that's lethal now, could we infect almost everyone in a very short time, so hiding/spreading/mutating/vaccine aren't relevant", and in this way we bypass much of the design problem). The problem with this is there just aren't vectors which get enough people, or at least none I can think of. For example, simultaneous addition of virii to worldwide water reservoirs, manufactured food, medical supplies (sneaky!), or common objects that change hands quickly such as money - none seem likely to work. My conclusion is that it just isn't that easy - that a would-be genocide will find it immensely hard. Forget magic time-delay virii, we don't have a way to do that now or in the foreseeable future. Whatever you put out there has a replication agenda not a deathly agenda, and that's what will prevail faster than you can kill all people out there. 

The red could be a dye so a fluid leak would be visible and therefore easier to patch without taking the whole unit off line for diagnostics. An internal gauge might show a drop in fluid pressure, but wouldn't show where the damage has occurred. 

30 years is not enough time. Rare minerals and precious metals do not become cheaper through mass-manufacture. No matter when your industrial revolution started, there is very little palladium on the Earth, some investors estimate less than 14 million ounces (very roughly: >400 US tons) has ever been mined. As it's uses become known it rises in value. I have not found an article that revealed how much palladium is required in palladium glass, but I suspect you will either need to compromise on your metal ingredients or find a completely new way of making palladium, like synthesizing it through nuclear fission. 

These natural electric currents are exploited for FTL travel. In simple terms, starships travel inside a magnetic bubble along an electric current to a nearby star, drop the bubble just in time to turn via gravity/slingshot, and then follow another electric rope to the next star. A few star systems (early Type II on the Kardashev scale) have created super-highways by strengthening the weak Birkland current between two distant stars. They can now skip past the connecting stars and travel directly hub to hub. Assuming navigational stars are average 5 light years apart, let's estimate a super-highway at 20 to 25 light years. My question is about the devices they use to do this. the device, I think...? I am picturing something like AC transformers, a mega-structure in space that converts the stars' electricity to a higher voltage, with a synchronized transformer at the other end. I'm not an electrical engineer so please correct me if I'm using the wrong electrical analogy. This is my placeholder artwork from an earlier draft: 

A lot depends on the air mix - very deep diving can involve helium instead of the usual gases, as the partial pressure of oxygen and other gases becomes critical. As this is a technical area, the best answer would depend on the gas mixture and the community's needs. These three wiki articles should help a lot with background and resources: $URL$ (Gaseous mixtures used for various depths and circumstances) $URL$ (Overview of breathing requirements and gas mixtures in the context of water depth, and how different depths are generally seen) This of course excludes any acclimatisation/adaptations that may occur, or (in the medium term) evolutionary changes, which may well occur too. $URL$ (May spark ideas by looking at how human biology has adapted in the communities that live permanently in the opposite environment) 

Wiring and other subtle sabotage would be a good target. Human with car? Chew wiring. Get into the exhaust or chew into pipework and plan to block the pipes or leave sooty deposits in the engine or pipework. Electrical devices? Chew, expose to rain, at a pinch chew the wirings and short them out as you die. Poison and product contamination are also workable - spread with paws and fur. Mice have numbers on their side, which makes kamikaze (in the broad sense of dying to do more harm) a workable approach. 

A mental link is not much of a problem You ask, "would the mind be able to cope with controlling its own motions while also sending motor orders to body parts it doesn't even possess?" and the answer is "probably quite well, in fact." The human mind is actually incredibly adept at adopting tools into its "body plan" and a number of experiments have shown how relatively easily it is to trick the mind into thinking that things that aren't part of its body actually are. Just think of the phantom limb phenomenon. You may think that that is slightly different because it's a limb that the mind feels like it 'should' have, but further experiments have shown that you can convince the mind that completely foreign objects are part of it. Further, adapting extensions to our body plans is commonplace. When you use a tool such as a wrench or grabber, it subconsciously becomes part of our body plans, and we sort of feel like we have an extended reach. We're not getting nearly as much sensory information from the tool, just a bit of vibration and resistance, but we still adapt it into our body plan to feel as though it is part of us in a sense. We work by "feeling" things with our tools. Even when we're driving cars we have a sense of adapting the car to our body plan, using information we get from sight and touch from the vibrations moving the vehicle to sense how close we are to other objects, how straight we are on the road, etc. Experiments in inducing out of body experiences have shown that where we feel like our consciousness is is highly susceptible to suggestion. There's nothing paranormal or supernatural about it - it's just a trick of the subconscious. But people have been able to be convinced that they are actually inside dolls that are larger or smaller than them,, for example. You see where I'm going with this: If the mental link is providing sensory input from the mech's body, and the pilot's body is not receiving much variance in its sensory input (he's restrained in a comfortable seat), then the pilot will pretty readily feel like he is the mech. And it does help that the mech already has the same basic body plan of the pilot - it is easier to trick someone into thinking they're a doll than a car. (Likely, this trick of adapting tools into body plans evolved alongside tool use, because it makes us feel much more natural when using them. Any master craftsman who has told you that they treat their tools as an extension of their bodies is not just being poetic, this is a real thing. I wouldn't be surprised if other tool-using animals have a similar cognitive experience, but it's an abstract question to ask a bonobo. Either way this is an aside since your protagonist is a human, presumably.) 

Store stable for how long? In theory no element is perfectly and infinitely stable. Quantum effects preclude it. (Hydrogen nucleus maybeee excepting, depends on the half-life of the proton when they figure it out). So I'd be looking at transmuting not storing. Preferably very common universally, and very dense indeed, and use that as raw material to to make other stuff on demand or to replenish needed stocks to the right level. Hydrogen is one obvious universal candidate for a raw material - and I think future hand waving allows us to project a means of storing it in its very dense metallic form (also helpful for its useful heat/conduction effects as well as density, and energy density too). Alternatively, if you can handle compact matter, a few teaspoons of that (think neutron star material either from a star or human-made) will give you supplies for ages. Containment and control would be tricky but probably solved for either of these by the time you can get these in useful quantities. For example, maybe stability is possible at a temperature or pressure we can realistically achieve, or specific forms or methods mean these are less of an issue. After all we dont know much right now except that they exist, but terms like "compact matter" cover many many kinds of physical entity, perhaps some will turn out to be more stable or amenable than others, when we get more able to research them in depth. That's about how room temperature superconductor research is progressing, and just when you thought that was an absolute limit, it turns out it wasnt. Even if we dont know an exact solution right now, hand waving the containment issue away or just about manageable or solved by that time, seems fair. Your next need is a way to transmute these to useful basic building blocks. I think if we grant a technology that can store and manipulate these, it can also probably make from them a wide range of useful basic elements, molecules and simple compounds without much effort. This actually isn't "too" far ahead technologically. We've had tentative reports we might have briefly created metallic hydrogen in the lab, laser fusion research has created exceedingly high densities fleetingly, the LHC has reported quark-gluon plasma, so perhaps compact matter should be feasible to create or obtain in the order of several decades to a couple of centuries, and by then turning these into most other elements, or elements into basic molecules won't be far behind. At that point you need a means of manufacturing prototype objects from schematics (that's your complex devices, protein molecules, tasty food etc) and from these. Think 3d printing in a couple of centuries time. Should be reasonable even for extremely complex molecules, food, device parts, even on a large scale (scaling up is what industry does all the time with discoveries, so I imagine a way will be found!) Which brings us to the last requirement: Your biggest need then is likely to be energy. Lots of it. This stuff will not be cheap in energy terms. That's the last ingredient. Fortunately dense hydrogen (and indeed many other universally available things) are able to sort that out for you -again in a few decades to a couple of centuries. Last problem is... People! Will they get bored! Update: choice of raw material A comment below asked why these exotic materials and not more familiar dense items such as lead or gold. The trouble is these are rare, hard to find, require a lot of extra processes to extract and to break down compared to the others - and after all that they still aren't nearly dense enough (probably by a couple or more orders of magnitude depending on the scenario!) to be useful for solving the problem as described. 

If you wish to use magic, you must apply for a permit. The permit is very cheap, or even free, as administrative costs in issuing and tracking them come out of the magic tax. If you are caught doing magic without a permit, you face fines, the severity of which depend on the "amount" of magic you're doing. (And possibly type, depending on what you want to enforce. Though using destructive magic harmfully would be a separate penalty.) Every year (or quarter or whatever, depending on how long energies take to dissipate), permit-holders must renew, at which point their auras are read and the tax is levied. There will be rogues and there will be people trying to cheat the system, but that's what ATF is for. (Arcana, Tetragrammaton, and Fate, of course.) 

I think there are actually two things here. One is "why aren't they rulers in their own right?", and the other is "why don't those they swear allegiance to use them to dominate their competition?" I'll answer each in turn. Why aren't they rulers? Not all heroes are good rulers, and many don't even want to rule. Prancealot is devoted to his religion moreso than he desires to be a ruler. The Kung Few have always been treated well by the Emperor and have no desire to upset that status quo. The 299.5 are soldiers, not administrators - and besides, 299.5 people trying to co-lead a nation would run into disputes over the best way to do things - and Hercufleas mostly just wants to retire to his farm. Why doesn't their sovereign use them to conquer? In addition to the points others have made about the balances of power (that is, other kingdoms have their own heroes and other heroes could band together, etc), there are reasons that the heroes may not be able to be swayed by even their lord to use their skills for their own gain. Prancelot's religious convictions make him want to defend the innocent, not conquer. The Emperor is wise enough to know that the Kung Few have a good point that their already impressive empire doesn't need to conquer the smaller states around it. The 299.5 recognize that their situation was unique and they don't want to push their luck. Hercufleas still just wants to be left alone to his farm. Now, a clever king could persuade even these heroes. "Prancelot, bring your religion to the heathens", "But the Kung Few, this nation over here has the temple holding the ancient scrolls of the Kung Many", "299.5, you are soldiers, what else are you going to do?, "Hercufleas, if you don't I'll burn down your farm." These things tend to end poorly for almost everyone involved, of course, because myths are usually Aesops. 

She needs to introduce hygiene to the medical profession before it becomes institutionalized. Perhaps she could become a housekeeper for a leading barber/surgeon. As part of her household duties she insists on sterilizing his tools, which he doesn't object to because she lays them neatly on a tray and assists him in a very organized fashion which also impresses his patients. She has some strange house rules about cleaning the hands, but again she is so efficient and flattering that he concedes to these minor demands. She is also very attractive and has the most perfect teeth of any person he has ever met, so he falls in love with her and is willing to accept some odd quirks. To the mothers and wives of the patients, our Dentist secretly gives advice on how to keep the wounds clean and care for the healing with herbs and boiled water, tinctures and ointments (who knows, maybe this becomes a side business and she is silent-partners with an apothecary). After a decade or two the barber-surgeon is so successful everyone is talking about it, and the King takes notice. Let's say that King is Henry VIII, who decides to organize all the barber-surgeons into a single guild. This actually happened in 1540. 

One potential method: the lifecycle of the host organism is complex and evolved to include four different organisms. A fungus, the subterranean beast, the wildlings, and a worm. The fungus infects the worm, which then is either eaten by the beast or the worm itself is also a parasitic organism that infects the beast. The beast spreads out long appendages that resemble trees that it uses to collect nutrients, water, and oxygen from the surface. This is something that the beast just does, whether it is infected or not, but the fungus has hijacked this process to spread its spores throughout this network. Once spread to the 'trees', the spores infect the wildlings. Like Cordyceps, it causes a change in behavior in certain organisms that it infects. In this case, it makes them aggressive and causes growths of black 'skin' and 'claws'. The skin is actually a covering of the fungal spores - the same spores present in the 'trees', so the aggressive behavior helps to spread it further. The 'claws' are a by-product of a change in the production of keratin. The hive mind is accomplished through pheromone communication. We know that plants actually have rudimentary forms of communication - it doesn't sound like too much of a stretch that a fungus could. The "queen" is really the colony of matured spores living in the subterranean beast. The juvenile spores also communicate with one another. Granted this can't go long distances, but 'messages' can get passed along a chain. The ultimate goal is for the infected wildlings to die, whereupon they become food for the larval form of the worm that then infects the beast.
