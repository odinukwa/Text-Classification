You might have biologists tweaking elephant genes before the apocalypse, developing it as a weapon. But maybe a coil gun through the snout would work better than rails 

If the booze-rat uses the alcohol as a defense mechanism, it must have a delivery system. Does it spray, like a skunk? Or bite and inject, like a snake? Either way, milking would involve holding the rat in some way, agitating it to trigger its defenses, and collect the juice. I can't help thinking about plopping them into something like this: 

They would probably crack open one of the secret virus weapons from a covert lab. Much easier for crazy leaders to push the button on such a weapon, than try to retarget and launch thousands of nukes without being stopped by someone sane, or some sanity check safety systems. Although the president has their finger on the launch codes/button, there is still a looong chain of command and computer systems required to actually carry out launches. A viral weapon only needs a handful of people to go out to subway stations, shopping malls and airports. 

Considering the rather hostile radiation environment on Europa, what communication and navigation systems might be used with near-future manned spacecraft? What would the ranges and features of this equipment be? I would be most interested to hear about the possible functionality of existing systems, such as VOR/DME, UHF/VHF radio comms, radar altimeters, or similar equivalents which a budding colony may distribute around the surface. Let's not assume the existence of a well-established GPS constellation nor availability of relay satellites, it is early days for my colony. My spacecraft will be orbital and suborbital short/medium-range transport craft, hopping from one outpost to another. I have been struggling with documents like this: $URL$ but it's a bit too much info for me. Are there low radiation areas or periodic low points which would be preferred for piloting activities? What radiation monitors would be used on the space craft, and what are the most meaningful variables to present to the pilot? Answers should work towards a Europa version of present day aircraft and Apollo-era spacecraft where possible. No subspace relays etc. If computers can be avoided or even explained away then that's great. I'm not worried about the pilot radiation dose, lets assume an adequate level of shielding on the pilot and vehicle electronics. A good answer will provide a brief summary of the radiation environment as it pertains to space flight, radiation environment "weather" patterns, with focus on the impact of such radiation on the piloting spacecraft, radio signal reception, quality and range... factors like that. 

The engine will not even start. There is almost no oxygen, and extremely low atmospheric pressure. The f-22 engine uses an air compressor to start the engine rotating, so that will fail. The fuel would likely freeze solid in the tank, since the average temperature on Mars is below the freezing point of kerosene..and if it doesn't, it will boil away as soon as it's injected into the engine due to the very low pressure.. Some parts may burst due to the unexpectedly low pressure. On earth, we do not have planes (jet or otherwise) which can go into orbit, even if designed to do so, and operating in much, much thicker air. Even replacing the engines with rocket engines isn't really enough. If you could somehow fly yur fighter plane up and out of the atmosphere, you then face the much harder task of speeding up to orbital speed. And if you somehow have magic engines to accelerate you, then how are you supposed to steer? Aircraft turn by using the flow of air over the vehicle control surfaces. The fighter will just tumble out of control (and experience malfunctions due to extreme cold and lack of pressure). On Mars, you will have control surface problems while still on the ground. Even with giant rocket engines strapped to the plane it wouldn't lift off the runway since raising the planes nose requires a substantial airflow over the elevators. With specially designed, high speed, extreme wingspan glider type aircraft powered by rocket engines flight on Mars is theoretically possible. It's been modeled in xplane and others. But if you put an unmodded F22 on Mars it'll handle and fly as well as a 20ton rock. 

You could have a fleet of small drones with efficient ion or em propulsion whose job is to attach to any dangerous debris and fire their engines enough to de-orbit the debris. Whether the drone goes with it or fires its engine to regain orbit is up to you. A kessler syndrome does not mean immediate destruction of everything. If a space station explodes, it will send out a cloud of debris, but this debris is unlikely to intersect anything else for thousands and thousands of orbits. Eventually some bit of debris hits another station and the situation worsens, but it's still not a terribly rapid process. Space is BIG and still mostly empty. Wikipedia page on space debris says that satellite lifetimes in a kessler syndrome would be reduced to years, or months. I think this is reasonable reaction time to be able to identify and track debris, launch interceptors and perform debris avoidance manouvers where necessary. Yes, it requires preplanning and thought, but the OP is looking for preventative measures, and stopping the cascade in the early stages is very important. 

There is no compelling reason to have many windows in an interplanetary space ship. Windows add weight, complexity and possible points of failure, and should be avoided as much as possible. However, there have been times where windows have proved useful for monitoring the vessel itself. Apollo 13 noticed the venting of some gas into space, providing a major clue as to what had happened and the seriousness of the event. They used reports of the position of the venting gas to help determine what it was that was leaking (they also used the thrust effects from this gas on the vehicles attitude to estimate the source). On the ISS, commander Chris Hadfield noticed through a window that flakes of something were departing from the station. This turned out to be an ammonia coolant leak. It can be assumed that astronauts on your vessel will need to make periodic spacewalks, to perform maintenance. It may be worth the cost of the window to be able to observe them directly from inside. It's arguable that video cameras would provide most of the above functionality. For stellar navigation, and monitoring of the destination as it approaches, telescopes penetrating or mounted on the outside of the hull would suffice, but a window or two would provide a nice backup. Humans, being humans, probably want a few windows to look out of, just to look out of. Psychology onboard a very long endurance mission is very important, and will in some cases override pure engineering arguments. One observatory, and a few strategically placed portholes would probably be acceptable. 

Although not directly related to nuclear war, given the difficulty in finding ANY evidence of a 2million year old civilization I just want to point out the one obvious remenant. Satellites in higher orbits, well clear of our atmosphere, will likely still be in orbit after 2 million years, even if solar wind and micro debris impacts have scoured their surfaces severely. Some of these satellites would be visible to the naked eye. 

As they grow up, there will be differences in bone density and muscle mass and probably a host of other problems due to the low gravity environment. But when born, they will be 100% pure human babies, the same as on earth. Things that happen during the organisms lifespan don't influence the next generation... jews have been cutting off foreskins for thousands of years, yet each generation stubbornly gets born with it again. 

You'd have to use lasers. A civilization so advanced as to be able to build an effective shield around a planet, or a totally enveloping minefield will have the ability to solve the virus problem too. Use x-ray or gama ray lasers fired from a constellation of satellites. Orders of magnitude more economical (and effective) than shields. 

I would suggest using base 12 (the duodecimal system) instead of 16. Base 12 has the advantage that you can divide 12 into half, thirds and quarters evenly. It makes for a more convenient everyday counting system, and there are no drawbacks. Our clock face is base 12, as is the year, as is inches to a foot, and troy weights (measurements of gold and gems). Unfortunately base 10 has proven difficult to shake off in general, but this is due to convention and habit only, not anything intrisic to the numeric base. 

What about having them stand tall, and take small steps on a T-shaped tail, like you'd move around if your ankles were loosely bound together? They'd look a bit like a wobbling penguin but still be very graceful once back in the water. 

The main problems with vacuum tube technology is that they are bulky, heavy and require a LOT of power to run. Most of that power turns into waste heat which needs to be dissipated, adding to the problems. You can avoid all these problems by locating the majority of the vacuum tubes on the ground instead of in the spacecraft. You would replace the AGC, GNC and AGS with decent radio communications, remote reading of the sensors, and control of the spacecraft equipment. There would be a time delay too, of course, but that is a challenge more than a show-stopper... the soviets drove moon rovers around for months by remote control for example. The early soviet Vostok and Voskhod spacecraft used vacuum tube technology. Early space probes used Vidicons (a type of vacuum tube/crt) for imaging, so a lot has already been achieved with the technology. Obviously the development of integrated circuits was a major breakthrough and NASA pushed this direction hard, but with the resources at their disposal back then, I still think it is plausible that a remote controlled manned landing could have been performed, had they really needed to do so. NASA had a strong design philosophy of having the astronauts in the control loop, and being able to fly the mission even if all communications were lost, but this is not essential to performing a landing. 

You are incorrect about using latin languages. The first computers took their input in the form of punched cards. in fact, punched cards were in use for programmable weaving machines long before computers were invented. I think its safe to say that your computer pioneers would invent a language to communicate with their computers, not build computers and inputs to suit the language. lets look at our own history of development for ideas: First, if their computer is binary based (likely) then they'll invent a language of ones and zeros, or holes and not holes, or black and white, or ups and downs, or tones and silence. Perhaps several of these. its the easiest/only way to work with primitive machines. The next stage is that the computer language no longer matches one-to-one with the program in memory. Instead, a sufficiently advanced program on the computer (a compiler), takes a more complicated (easier for humans to read and write) language and translates it into the binary language. Our history took Assembly, a set of names for "slots" or storage spaces (registers) in the computer, and short names for commands which work on them. Each instruction in the language and the arguments to the instruction are literally translated to ones and zeros, which directly work in the cpu. Dealing with literal addresses in memory is pretty inflexible, so the concept of names and labels was introduced, with a tool called a linker. It assigns addresses and keeps track of them, meaning you can refer toeyour variables and numbers by name, not location. You can see by this point that a few critical linguistic concepts are in play... verbs, describing actions on data, which is named. A further class of instruction involves decisions... if the result of something is zero, go to a different memory address(area of program) and start executing the instructions there, otherwise continue. This, more or less, is the full set of instructions you need to solve pretty much anything (aka being Turing complete). you will need your language and computer to be turing complete if you want it to be a proper, flexible computer, but further refinements to the commands and language are basically for convenience, ease of use, speed of execution, not really essential to solve problems. Depending on how your language works, and how advanced the computers are, some kind of symbolic references for the instructions and names would be developed. perhaps its ok with one key for each instruction (typically you would have some tens of instructions in a simple computer), and some way to compose variable names (combinations of phonetic sounds?), using numbers as a worst case would be prevalent, much like the latin character set got itself firmly embedded in modern computers. I find it hard to believe their primitive computers would be required to support thousands of characters just because their language demands it, they'd likely be required to develop a reduced character set representation of their language (probably phonetic) as a part of their computer development. It's been said that had we discovered binary mathematics and boolean logic sooner our computer development would have occured much sooner too. If your culture can not find a cut-down wayeto represent commands and variables it'll likely prevent them from developing computers. Only much, much later would computers be developed enough to handle the natural language. look as what we have today, you can (in a limited sense) say what you want and have the computer speak the response back to you. That took 50 years of breakneck speed development to achieve. Natural language handling is an extremely advanced computer science field, the fundamental computer design is long, long established before the input matures.
