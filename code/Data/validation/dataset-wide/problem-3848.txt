Let's consider only global case. Let $G_n$ be classical algebraic group over global # field (eg, $GL(n),SO(n), U(n)$...) and let $\pi_n$ be its irr. cusp. reps of $G_n$. Then we can define the period of two reps $\pi_{n+1}$ & $\pi_n$ as follows; For $f_{n+1}\in \pi_{n+1}$ and $f_{n}\in \pi_{n}$ , define P($f_{n+1},f_{n}$):=$\int_{[G_n]}f_{n+1}(g)f_{n}(g)dg$ (here, we consider $f_{n+1}$ as a function of $G_n$ by restriction and [$G_n$]:=$G_n(F)$$Z_{G_n}$($\mathbb{A}$)\$G_n$($\mathbb{A}$)) Then several articles say that it gives an element of $Hom_{G_n}$($\pi_{n+1} \otimes \pi_n,\mathbb{C}$). But I am wondering how one can ensure the above period converges. And I am also wondering that whenever people uses the global seesaw identity, many people just use the Fubini theorem without proof. However, in contrast to global case, when they working in local field case, they always manifest the absolute convergence issue before using seesaw identity. Why does they not concern about absolute convergence issue in working global situation? Is there some mechanism I don't know which resolves such issues automatically? 

I'm looking to find a root $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ of a polynomial $p \in {\mathbb R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ such that $0 \leq x_i < 1$ for all $i$. Further, I know in advance that setting $x_1 = \cdots = x_n$ is a root of $p$, but wish to avoid this root. How can I find at least one of these roots, preferably using a computer? In more detail, $p$ is formed by taking two homogeneous polynomials $q_1, q_2$ (of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$) where every coefficient is either zero or one, letting $D$ be the least common multiple of $d_1$ and $d_2$, and setting $p = q_1^{D/d_1} - q_2^{D/d_2}$. This is encoding the simultaneous solution to the equations $$q_1(x) = y^{d_1}, \quad q_2(x) = y^{d_2}$$ over $(x_1,\dots,x_n, y) \in [0,1)^{n+1}$. 

This doesn't qualify as "shortest" but is my favorite example of why humans can't solve the halting problem: 

This might be a stupid question for expert in this area. I am considering automorphic representation of algebraic group. In studying it, local tempered, local square integrable representations occurs in the P-adic group case. So, I am wondering that what global automorphic representation gives rise to such representation at some finite set of places? Does globally sq. int. auto. represenation give local sq. int reps at S, some finite set of places of F? If not, would you tell me what kind of global automorphic representation would be locally sq. int for finite set of places? One more notation question. What is the meaning of tempered auto. reps. in global situation? For I learned its definition only in the local case, I suppose it should be locally tempered at finite ramified places. Is it ture? 

For local fields $F$, we consider two case 1) $E$=quadratic extension of $F$ , 2) $E = F \times F$. Let V be a 2-dim hermition space over E. In 1) case, by Cartan decompostion $U(2)$ can be decomposed as $KMK$. (here, $K$ is a compact subgroup of $U(2)$ and M={$x \in E^\times | \left\vert x \right\vert \le 1 $} In 2) case, $U(2)=GL_2 (F)$ the cartan decomposition of $U(2)$ is $KMK$ where $K$ is compact subgroup and $M$={ $\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\ 0 & y \end{pmatrix} \in GL_{2}(F)$ | $|x|\le|y|$ }. My question arises here. If we consider $U(1)$, then, how can we think the Cartan decomposition of it in the above two cases? I don't know what the above $M$ should be in these case. 

Does anyone know a good book or article on the History of the Fourier transform? It's first appearance (of the transform) and use in particular? Or at least some source with some historical information on that matter. There is plenty about the Fourier series but I couldn't find much illuminating about the transform yet. Thanks. 

You should have a look at $URL$ It appeared also peer reviewed journal but may not be freely accessible. There are more papers of Vega and collaborators on Hardy's uncertainty principle where you might find your answer. I have not clarified whether this answers your question exactly but it is at least very related and you might be able to work your way from there. 

Dear community. I would like to derive a "good" estimate on $\frac{d}{dt}f_\epsilon(t)$, where $f_\epsilon$ is a regularization of a Zygmund-continuous function $f$, i.e. $|f(x-\tau)+f(x+\tau)-2f(x)| \leq C |\tau|$ for all $x \in dom(f)$. The regularization is defined as usual. We use an even function $\rho \in C_0^\infty(\mathbb R)$ with $\int_{\mathbb R} \rho(\tau)d\tau = 1$, set $\rho_\epsilon(t) := \frac{1}{\epsilon}\rho\left( \frac{t-s}{\epsilon} \right)$ and define $f_\epsilon$ by convolution as $f_\epsilon(t) := (f \ast_{s}\rho)(t)$. If one uses the implication Zygmund $\Rightarrow$ LogLipschitz, the one easily obtains the estimate $|\frac{d}{dt}f_\epsilon(t)| \leq C \log\left( 1+\frac{1}{\epsilon} \right)$. I would like to have a better estimate than this. This means I would like to use the fact, that $f$ is Zygmund, not just LogLipschitz. The obvious ideas don't work, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe one should use a special mollifier?! Does anyone have some experience in this direction? Or can one point to literature? It would be nice to get something like $|\frac{d}{dt}f_\epsilon(t)| \leq C \left(\log\left( 1+\frac{1}{\epsilon} \right)\right)^{1/2}$ Thanks! 

Has it been proven that maximal planar graphs are reconstructible? It seems like an easy result, but I am unable to find it in the literature. Classes of planar graphs that I know are reconstructible are: maximal outerplanar (Manvel 1970), maximal minimally non-outerplanar (has a single interior vertex) (Kunni, Annigeri, 1979), and classes where planar isn't the key property: like trees or cacti (Geller, Manvel, 1969). Perhaps this has not been explicitly answered because it was only recently (Bilinski, Kwon, Yu, 2007) when it was proven that planar graphs are recognizable, which is the "hard" part of this result. Bonus question: Are there other classes of planar graphs that are known to be reconstructible? 

Nauty really is optimized for small graphs, if you use the C library interface. McKay (and others, such as myself) frequently use this library to generate all graphs of a given small order, which requires canonical labeling of small graphs very quickly. This happens many many many times (see $URL$ for the growth of the number of unlabeled graphs). In fact, McKay's program geng can compute all 12,005,168 graphs on 10 nodes in less than an hour on my laptop. 

Dear community. I'm looking for survey articles about recent and old results about stability for the elliptic and backward-parabolic Cauchy problem. For example: Take $\partial_t u + a(t)\partial^2_x u = 0$ with $u(0,x)=u_0(x)$. What is the minimal regularity-assumption on $a$, in terms of a first or second order modulus of continuity to get HÃ¶lder continuous dependence of the solution on the initial data. Or: What is the best condition like $|f(t)a(t)|\leq C$ on $a\in C^1(0,T]$ to get the same result. Another question is what happens if we mix this two conditions. Often is claimed, that Lipschitz is the optimal regularity. But I think this is, like for uniqueness, not true. At least for Zygmund there should be a similar result and also maybe for coefficients with a first order modulus of continuity $\mu$ satisfying the Osgood Condition: $\int\limits_0^1 \frac{ds}{\mu(s)}=+\infty$. Maybe there is not so much in this direction. For hyperbolic equations there are a lot of results with this kind of conditions. Best CJ 

You can construct the graph explicitly as well, although the one I describe is much larger than the one you get from the Gale-Ryser technique. Take your input graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ and a number $r \geq \Delta$. Create $(r+1)!$ copies of $G$. For each vertex $v_i \in V(G)$, let $d_i$ be the degree of $v_i$ in $G$. Partition the $(r+1)!$ copies of $G$ into parts of size $r-d_i+1$ (which divides $(r+1)!$). For each part, connect all copies of $v_i$ with edges. This increases the degree at each $v_i$ from $d_i$ by $r-d_i$ to $r$. 

This program halts if and only if there is an odd perfect number. Of course, the query "is $n$ perfect" is not terribly short (but can be computed by adding one more for loop). 

Assuming a "closed walk" can repeat vertices, we can count closed walks starting at $0$ by counting the $r$-sequences of $[n]$ so that each number appears an even number of times. The bijection is given by labeling edges by the coordinate that is toggled between the vertices. You can probably count these sequences by inclusion/exclusion and then multiply by $2^n/r$ to account for the choice of start position.
