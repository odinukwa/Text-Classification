Assuming you mean the Cosmic Microwave Background ... The CMB is entirely in a very narrow range of the microwave part of the spectrum. Galaxy emissions are all over the spectrum. The CMB comes uniformly from all over the sky. It's like looking at painting that is all one color. Galaxy light looks like pinpoints on a dark background. (Nearby galaxies are not pinpoints, but those at cosmological distances look that way.) The CMB matches the exact wavelength we expect for light that is heavily redshifted from the moment of last scattering. That moment was hundreds of millions of years before galaxies ever formed. Light from oldest galaxies are at a redshifted wavelength from 500 million years after the last scattering. If the CMB was due to early starlight reflecting off dark objects, you would see a very different spectrum. It would contain many absorption lines as the dark objects absorbed some wavelengths better than others. Also the reflected starlight would be across a wide range of frequencies, unlike the CMB which has a very narrow range. 

Many, many moons throughout our solar system are tidally locked. $URL$ This wikipedia page lists 34 moons throughout our solar system that are known to be tidally locked, and another 26 that are suspected. It is very common for moons within a certain distance of their planets to be tidally locked. If they are too far away, they won't be tidally locked. Astronomers have even deduced that some exoplanets are tidally locked, but I have no idea how they know that. This leads to some interesting questions: 

This is a question, where I start with some assertions: Try to consider the universe as a four-coordinate system, x,y,z,t where t is time and where we view a change in t as a change in position, and as a velocity in the same way as any other change in either of the other components of the coordinate. Everything is then moving at the speed of c. The difference between a photon and another particle would be that a photon "spends" its velocity in any of the x, y or z dimensions - but not in the time dimension. This implies that all photons are on the same coordinate in the t-dimension - only the x,y,z values change while t remains 0. It also implies that time would appear to stop for something travelling in only the other dimensions, while it would pass fastest for something completely stationary. You can then also consider space-time as a function of acceleration. A physical objects' coordinate could be derived from its velocity, which would have to be derived from its acceleration. Acceleration would be a function of entropy, or "age" I believe. Is this the basis of general relativity? Is it at least an initial starting point for general relativity, or is it completely wrong? Would spin have to be part of the coordinate system? 

Our best guess is that if Venus had an ocean, it did 4 billion years ago. Then it had the runaway greenhouse effect due to its thick atmosphere. The runaway greenhouse effect would have boiled away the oceans if the planet ever had oceans. There are several guesses about why its surface is so young (300 million to 600 million years old). One is that the planet get so hot the entire surface melts. It has no plate tectonics and it has a super thick atmosphere to trap the heat. All that heat melts the surface every half billion years or so. Another reason is that it has many very large volcanoes. (167 volcanoes over 100 km across.) That's far more very large volcanoes than Earth has. Those volcanoes resurface the planet and keep it young. 

I doubt two black holes could form within a single star, but they might form from a contact binary. That's a pair of stars so close that they touch and share a single atmosphere. For the stars that made the black holes for the LIGO gravitational wave discovery, just consider two very massive stars that are touching or nearly touching. They would share a single gaseous envelope for an atmosphere. Each one separately formed a black hole when it died, and then their two black holes merged. 

13 billion years ago, the universe was about 600 million years old according to many scientists. At that time, all matter in the universe would have to be closer, or in other words denser. Did time pass more slowly, at that time, relative to now? I ask, because increased gravity causes time to pass more slowly. If we'd been there, and measured the speed of light as we measure it today, would the speed of light be different? Finally, does distant stars look magnified, given that a "tiny" universe is stretched on our entire sky? I assume then that we'd measure time based on caesium 133 and distance not as a function of the speed of light, but as a theoretical physical "device" that would be the same physical length then and now. 

Are there pictures that contain high enough dynamic width, so that amateurs can use fourier spectrum analysis to observe the redshift themselves? I know pictures usually are encoded using RGB and/or CMYK and therefore lose a lot of color information from a physical perspective, but I'm wondering if there exists a picture format that could store that much information, and if so, could amateurs then use fourier spectrum analysis to actually see the red-/blueshift? 

The outer layers of the star will fall onto the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk as the star stuff spirals in. Like this image shows. 

There was only one time in recorded history when a star was visible to the naked eye and not within our galaxy. That was Supernova 1987A. When the astronomer, Ian Shelton, first saw it through a telescope, he was amazed at how bright it looked. Thinking it might be naked-eye visible, he stepped out of the observatory and saw it within his own eye. Since then, all the stars you see are nearby stars within our galaxy. All naked-eye visible stars are within a 17 thousand light years. Most are actually within a few hundred light years, but there are some bright stars within the 47 Tucanae globular cluster that are 17 thousand light years away. 

@Knu8 was right that adding mass to a gas giant will turn it into a star long before the gas giant could become a white dwarf or neutron star. But that works if you add fusionable material such as hydrogen. If you add something that can't fuse into a heavier element, such as Iron or Tin, the matter just keeps accreting onto the gas giant until the planet collapses under its own weight until electron-degeneracy pressure holds it up. That's when it becomes a white dwarf. Thanks @Knu8 for the right answer. I gave you an upvote for that. I posted a separate answer to describe what happens if you add heavier elements. 

When a clock travels close to the speed of light as observed by us, it should tick slower. Does this mean that, when using this clock to measure a second - it could travel much more than 300 000 km during a second? In fact, this clock could travel infinitely fast when viewed only from its own perspective? Does this imply that if I traveled on a space ship, at the speed of 99 % of light, I would age 4 years, but could reach a destination perhaps 400 light years away? My friends and family on earth would have perished, but the people I saw on the destination planet as I started my journey will have aged only 4 years as well. If the last assumption is correct; it means that we could watch a launching space ship at alpha centauri, it could arrive here in just 3-4 days - appearing to travel much faster than the speed of light, without breaking the laws of relativity. We would just say that it was relativistic blue shift that made it seem to travel faster than the speed of light. 

The term for when the sun is at its highest is "solar noon". $URL$ It is the moment the sun crosses the meridian. The meridian is an imaginary half-circle that goes from the northernmost point on the horizon to the highest point directly above you and then to the southernmost point on the horizon. The sun is always at its highest point in its daily path when it crosses the merdian. You're right that in earlier centuries, each town would set its clocks at noon for when the sun was at its highest point. Those of us who are familiar with astronomy and history would call that type of timekeeping "apparent solar time". You can't guarantee an exact 24 hour day with "apparent solar time", so some people used "mean solar time" instead. (Historical note: Having each town choose its local noon became a nightmare for railway companies that wanted to set train schedules. So the railway companies urged the creation of 4 time zones in America and encouraged each small town to use "standard time" instead of "apparent solar time". And as rgettman already mentioned, the term for the sun's height above the horizon is "altitude". Astronomers use the term "elevation" for a person's distance above sea level. 

Imagine that hypothetically the black hole in the center of the milky way gradually increased in mass by for example 50% every year. That is exponential increase in mass. Which visual effects would we see on for example Alpha Centauri, stars more distant and on M31? Red or blueshift? Lensing? How about linear increase in mass? Are there software I can use to visualize it as seen from earth? 

If you trace two particles' world line backwards in time, according to current theory, both objects should converge at big bang. Would both objects arrive there simultaneously? Another way of asking the question: Is there any evidence that supports the idea that new matter is "introduced" into the universe as a continuous stream, as opposed to everything coming from a singularity both in time and space? The analogy would be from the inside of a black hole. For each particle in that singularity, they would all have a world line that starts at the same spacial coordinate, but the particles would not be "introduced" into the black hole simultaneously. You can argue that time stops having meaning in a black hole, but that's only true for an "outer observer" in my reasoning. 

There is some evidence that Population III stars formed as early as 200 million years after the Big Bang. The oldest known star, the Methuselah Star, dates back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. It is a second generation star (judging from its metal content), so that means a generation of very large stars must have lived and died before this one was born. 

To say the "speed of light" is (mostly) about light is a common misunderstanding of that speed. It's actually the speed of causality, and it has far more implications that merely how fast photons propagate. It is also the conversion factor from mass to energy. (E = mc^2) When space expands the photons within it don't suddenly go faster to cover the expansion. Think of it this way. Let's say you have a beetle crawling across a rubber sheet and you stretch that rubber sheet to double its original size. Does the beetle suddenly start crawling twice as fast? No, the beetle still plods along at its same speed. Just like light crossing the universe. The universe expands and light has to take more time. 

When a particle travels through spacetime, this is sometimes illustrated moving in flat grid with various depths. How accurate is this way of imagining gravity? Can the gravity well be infinitely deep? Gravity well $URL$ Looking at this illustration, it suggests that there is an amount of distance going down the well. Is movement down the well limited by the speed of light? Remember, I'm aware that it is an illustration, and the question is about the accuracy of the illustration. Is all gravitational wells infinitely deep at the exact center? So that if a particle could be made small enough to fit within the center, it would become a black hole. 

When matter crosses the event horizon, it is easy to imagine that matter is torn apart into their individual components by tidal wave effects. Atoms would be ripped apart eventually. At one time, the particles will fall so deep into the gravity well, that a single particle would be touching both sides of the gravity well at the same time. At that moment, I choose to assume that the particle particle core may be spaghettified, but externally it will appear to be shrinking. Knowing that spaghettification is dependent on the size of the object, as well as the difference in gravity on both sides, a shrinking particle may eventually become so small that the steepness of the gravity well is no longer a problem. The particle continues to shrink forever. Over time, gravity between all the particles that have shrunk, will again start to take effect - and I imagine that that is what happened in the big bang. So the cosmic inflation, could just as well be particle shrinking, as a result of all particles in our universe being within the same black superhole. Taking this idea, we could look at our own universe and I guess we would expect to see certain effects such as accelerating cosmic expansion, perhaps a cosmic background radiation and we would expect our universe to end as a cold, dead place. Is this a known theory or idea, and where can I find papers on it? 

On the other hand, if our Solar System passes near a relativistic jet emanating from the central black hole of a galaxy, Earth will get hit with high speed particles that will disrupt the magnetosphere and ozone layer. Definitely not good for any life on Earth at that time. Getting ejected from the galaxy also means there is less chance of future humans exploring the galaxy by hopping to nearby stars. We'd only have our solar system to explore and colonize. There would not be another star system within a hundred thousand light years. 

When the white dwarf steals enough material to get bigger than 1.4 solar masses, the dwarf will become a Type Ia supernova. This is probably why we never (rarely?) see Thorne–Żytkow objects made from a white dwarf instead. If the white dwarf actually collides with its companion star before it explodes as a supernova, I could imagine it would fall into the center as the stellar material drags down the orbit of the white dwarf. Maybe then it will form something like a Thorne–Żytkow object. Or maybe it will accumulate enough material as it falls in to create a neutron star, at which point it blows itself apart in Type II supernova.
