The best way to show that something is alien is showing how humans react to it. The human characters will not understand it. They might be afraid of it. They might be repulsed by it. They might accidentally break it. They might accidentally operate it, with disastrous consequences. They might overlook it. It might not be easy, finding the door on an alien wall. This can be contrasted with aliens using their own technology. They have no problems at all. 

(Reusing parts of several other answers) This is not only an ID chip, but it is your own personal AI doctor! This doctor is distributed in several chips in important places, brain, heart, spine, liver etc. These chips monitor your health continuously and sending the information to a central register. (the AI isn't actually on the chips, but in this central register) If you develop some condition that requires medical intervention, you will get a phone call from a doctor asking you to come visit. Since most conditions will be detected much earlier than today, much time and money will be saved and much suffering avoided. Incidentally, this continuous data stream will also give away your position. Bad news for kidnappers. Kidnappers can obviously wrap people in tin foil or something, but that in itself sets off an alarm. Of course, in this Big Brotherish future, there will be HD cameras everywhere, so an alarm will be followed by pictures of the kidnappers being posted to all nearby police. If you move a chip from one person to another, the data stream will be interrupted and will give different data when it comes back. You would also need to move all the chips at once since they are talking to each other. If you anesthetize the person, this is very visible on the medical data. If you operate without anesthetics, the pain will also be very visible. The chips have a private key that is used to authenticate you. A different key is used to encrypt the data so that only the medical center can use it. While it could be possible to fish the authentication key out using electron microscopes, magnetic resonance or whatever, it would not be possible without removing the chip from the person. People can obviously remove or break their own chips, but then they will be non-persons. Apart from not being able to pay for things in shops, you will also stand out like a sore thumb. A camera or motion detector seeing a person where there is no ID chip will raise the alarm. Civil liberty types will be very unhappy about this setup, and this should be reflected in the story. It is up you whether these people are heroic freedom fighters or foolish paranoid Luddites. The best stories will result from making both perspectives seem possible. 

In principle there's nothing stopping a plant from developing a natural radio. Let's start with what a radio really is, in the most reductive form. A radio is nothing more than an antenna made of conductive material to particular dimensions, to make it resonant with electromagnetic waves of a particular frequency. By applying a changing electrical charge to it, we can cause it to emit signals of that frequency, and we can use it to receive signals of that frequency. Optionally, we might add a waveguide to concentrate or direct the signal. The conductor is easy - any nervous system is already a network of conductors transmitting electrical signals. Forming a section of nerve-like tissue in the shape of a patch antenna (so named for simply being a rectangle of copper on a surface or similar), placed near the surface, would make a perfectly serviceable, if rudimentary antenna. With this alone the rocket could communicate by radio over short distances by thinking into the antenna. Power is an issue but not insurmountable, given your plant is intelligent and able to grow rockets. Adding a waveguide isn't much harder. A properly shaped section of wood could easily act as a parabolic dish, and specially shaped cavities to act as resonators and waveguides is not without precedent- whales and dolphins already evolved this for their sonar. On the ground, a natural crater or dormant caldera would make for a marvellous dish - a particularly tall tree with a handful of antennae at the focal point of the dish would make for an excellent receiver. Combining the two, you could in theory have a plant that manages to incorporate a radio. It doesn't have to be a patch and a parabolic dish, either: if your plant can engineer a rocket, it can engineer an antenna and waveguide of any kind. In practice a lot will depend on the specific properties of the materials available to your plant. Mere wood as we know it is unlikely to be suitable for a waveguide, and the nervous system is unlikely to be up to the task of transmission. In the case of Avatar, the superconducting unobtanium rather dramatically solves the latter issue, though something more boring like a copper nervous system would probably be more than sufficient. Either way some exotic plant materials may be necessary to make this all work. 

The short answer is that whoever is powerful enough to set up the pocket dimension will be capable of creating whatever weather conditions they want. Which means that you as the author can decide. That being said, we can do some guesses. If the elemental plane of Air contains only air, with no water in it, the atmosphere will probably never contain enough water to create rain. Sure, water will be continuously evaporating, but the wet air will be blown into the plane of Air before it gets wet enough. However, this depends on there being enough air exchanged daily. As the creator you can set this how you want. There is also the ocean to consider. How hot is the water in the plane of Water? Will the local sun have time to heat it significantly before it disappears back into the elemental plane? How wide is the oceans around the island? All this can be changed around as you wish. And then there is the ground. How well does it retain heat during the night? This decides how cold it gets and how much thermal wind you will be seeing. The higher the temperature difference, the more wind. However, this will not be much of a wind. Look at Sea breeze for more info. If you do set up things so that you get rain, it will probably fall at night, probably as a light drizzle. 

You may not realise, but animals no more run by instinct than do humans. Like humans, they too have needs. These needs are served by the Animal Court, lowest of the heavenly courts. Formed from the descendants of twelve virtuous animals (the animals of the Chinese zodiac) the Animal Court convenes twice a year and attends to the administration of the animal world, hearing pleas and grievances and communicating them to the higher courts. Being an official of the Animal Court has its privileges: members of the court are permitted to remove their hides and live as humans while the court is not convened, conducting ourselves as they see fit so long as we do not become derelict in our duties. However, we animal courtiers are feared by humans; Werewolves, wicked humans so cruel they were demoted into bestial forms for their crimes, also wear the skins of animals to savage their fellow humans. Alas, not all werewolves take the form of wolves. Unfortunately, most humans aren't able to distinguish between us and so both of us are hunted alike. In times past, the solution was to convene the court far from prying eyes, away from the cities. But now that humanity has industrialised and humans flock to cities like never before, it has become impossible to simply avoid humans as we once did. But even the cities have animals and the Animal Court is still responsible for them. So the question is: how can we still hold court without getting caught? A few notes: 

Several answers mention that communism works in small groups, like families, but fails in large groups, like countries. The main difference between these two cases is simply size. In a small group everybody knows everybody. If somebody becomes too greedy, people will notice and punish them. If you are a part of a society and everybody there thinks you have been bad, that hurts. Note that this system doesn't work perfectly, people can get blamed for things that are not their fault. In a large group people can be greedy and get away with it. And when other people see that, they will be greedy too, until greed becomes the norm. Communism is based on the idea that people will are not greedy, so communist countries break down. Capitalism is based on the idea that Greed is Good. This has its own problems, but that is not relevant to the question. The usual conclusion is that communism doesn't work, but I think that is too pessimistic. What is needed is a way for everybody to know everybody. What if there was a way for people to tell each other about unseemly greed? What if, before you talked to me, you could check me up in some database to see what other people think about me? There are many websites and apps today for sharing experiences with hotels and other service providers exactly so that you can check them up before you go there. What if we made the same system for people? If this worked, people would become nice simply because they want other people to think about them as nice. Unfortunately, these kind of systems can be gamed. "If you rate me high, I'll rate you high." I don't know a way around that and it could be a fatal flaw. 

Oh, that's easy. Attack surface. If you have one mage you can put him in a garden shed (or equivalent) while he casts and the enemy probably won't get through your army before he finishes the spell, nor are they likely to nail him with an arrow. If they can it was a lost cause anyway. If you have twenty mages standing in formation to protect it's harder to keep all of them from being interfered with - a volley of arrows will probably hit at least one and ruin the spell. Putting them in a fortification would be harder too. 

None of these tactics guarantees a kill against a powerful Blood Shaman, but they all present at least a small chance to gain the upper hand against a Shaman. And the Shaman has to win every engagement. We just have to win once. 

Stop right there. Language is easy to learn. Children do it as easy as breathing. Kids can even learn multiple languages at once without breaking a sweat. It is just when we become adults it becomes hard. A simpler language makes for a simpler, less capable mind. We really don't want to do that to our children. Your only valid point is 

Rock Band. Grab some random musicians/singers. Throw together a band. Become their manager. Bands are expected to have a messy economy. Books, what books? We have this suitcase full of cash. Not sure where it came from. Probably the place we played last week. Or was it this week? Springfield, I think, not sure which state. 

Ideology, to terraform or not. These colonies are approaching the point where they can turn Mars into Earth version 2. Native life is discovered somewhere. Terraforming will kill this life. Now two sides form, that roughly corresponds to the two companies: 

Good news, it's not too hard for our friend Tunguska. The magic word is realpolitik Let's get started with her strategic profile. She's not an army - strategically, she's a walking, talking metaphor for the nuclear bomb. If her pet country were reduced to waste in a war, she could still obliterate at least one or two major cities of the offending (super)power before being brought down herself. That nearly automatically* makes her a small nuclear power in her own right, so long as she can protect herself from a first strike. From a realpolitik perspective, that she's in fact a literal fire-breathing dragon means less than her geopolitical value. If she's politically valuable, even the staunchest dracophobe will sing her praises to high heaven and overlook even the deepest flaws. If she's a political foe, she could have spent her time in hiding as Mother Teresa herself and she'd still be a baby-eating monster for whom a swift death is the only appropriate course of action. This provides her with a pathway to sovereign status: by making a deal with, say, Russia (since she was born there) to recognise her sovereignty in exchange for her alliance she can quickly secure her place in the world, while the superpower in question transforms a rogue nuclear weapon into a known (and allied!) quantity. She'd still make enemies, but with superpower backing and personal power a direct move against her would be foolhardy in the extreme. The tricky bit is the fact that Tunguska is also gearing up to get into a war. That may turn her into a liability if she's not careful. Since she's at the same strategic scale as a nuclear weapon, countries will understandably get very very nervous if she starts fighting anyone; it will be very important to make sure the right people know what she's up to, lest she spark a nuclear conflict - or a pre-emptive strike to prevent one. The plus side is that assuming her rival has the same idea (only convincing someone to ally to make dragons quietly go away), there's a good chance the whole dragon war can be kept localised - like other proxy wars geopolitics will keep the big players' hands tied for fear of sparking a more final war, and both Tunguska and her rival will probably be told in no uncertain terms to keep it that way. If her rival doesn't, well, that only means Tunguska has a chance to convince the world that this is something they want to get involved in as a global matter and propaganda herself into a champion of humanity. She'd at least get her own ally onboard - it can't hurt for their dragon to to win that fight. *There's a reasonable case to be made that some countries might declare her a sovereign power unilaterally, simply because diplomats and the army are the most appropriate tools to interact with her. 

Everybody seems to be discussing courts and lawyers. As I see it, the question is mostly about culture. Consider a man who has exploited a loophole in a contract or law to gain something. In most cultures on Earth, he will go around bragging about this, and people will applaud how clever he has been. And this means he will try to do it again. In some cultures, both on Earth and in fiction, people will think he has been a bad person who should be ashamed of himself. And this means he will NOT try to do it again. Most cultures are somewhere between these extremes, of course. The form of the laws and courts are irrelevant. They only reflect the norms of their culture. [Editted to add:] You were interested in how courts would work in such a culture. I think the settlement courts would be more important. In this court, both parts have agreed to meet to settle a disagreement. The focus of the court would be find an agreement both parts can accept. But if negotiations fail, the judge(s) would have the power to decree a settlement. There would be no question of fines and punishment, just recompense. As for criminal law, community service would be more common. Also recompense to the victims. Or so I guess. 

You, uh, you understand that this demand leads immediately to the total defeat of the moon, yes? Earth happily capitulates, then shortly thereafter wins the war. In this world you've designed, the moon relies on its ability to arbitrarily shoot down anything Earth launches at it for its defence. Now you ask Earth to start sending rockets full of resources. You just gave the Earthlings an all access pass through your defences. They could do anything with that access. That resource rocket actually contained an enormous nuke. Those resources are contaminated with an insidious genetically engineered disease. That last shipment smuggled in Flash Gordon and now he's going to seduce the beautiful daughter of your brilliant but moral-to-a-fault lead scientist. That rocket just unfolded to reveal a WW2-era Japanese battleship, and it's charging its overpowered energy cannon now. Better go back to the drawing board. 

(As others have said, haters are gonna hate, they don't really need a reason) Other answers have concentrated on the "enhancement" angle, I would like to say a few words about the "prosthetics" angle. Losing a limb is seen by some as a sign of the gods' disfavour. This has happened time and again throughout history. If you live life without that limb you might be in disfavour, but at least you have humbly accepted the gods' judgment. People will tolerate you. If you use a prosthetic openly, you are defying the gods. No good will come of this and people will avoid you. If you use a prosthetic and hide it, you are a cheater and a fraud. You endanger everybody around you as the gods' wrath can strike them down for associating with you. If you are found out, you will be put to the torch.
