I have been doing plank hold in good form since atleast 2-3 months. I get shakey after 10 seconds even though I can hold it between 60-75 seconds. I don't see any improvement in shakiness. What does it mean? Is it Weak core? 

After having pushed myself too hard on incorrect form and nursing multiple injuries, I want to start lifting afresh under a coach. My goal is to gain strength without gain in size, though I wouldn't mind if it comes as a natural consequence. This time, I want to be very, very particular about form. In my place, trainers at commercial gym are body-building oriented and not that particular about details of correct form. I am planning to train under a powerlifting coach. However, I have a few concerns. I have come across ideas like powerlifters aren't very concerned about form, their main focus is to lift as heavy as they can. This idea probably came from a few figure-competitors and body-builders. Just want to know if there is any truth in the above statement? 

I've found that trainers or other experienced body builders are great to work out with because they can help with form and method. One of the biggest issues I have is muscle isolation, meaning that while trying to workout a certain muscle group, I actually work out another. Example: Tricep dips, I end up extending out too far and end up working my shoulders instead of my triceps. I realized this after watching training videos. But I never felt like it was working my shoulders so I never thought about it. My question is, how can a person who is training alone help to realize when they are not isolating the target muscle group and prevent doing so? Watching videos is a great way to get the form right but since no one is there watching me, what can I do to make sure my form is correct and that I'm isolating the target muscle group? 

I have found that lifting heavy helps with pain in my joints. As such I have no particular goal like muscle gain or endurance, etc. Its just that I don't go for too low reps and rapid progression so that my joints have enough time to adapt to higher resistance. Lifting heavy increases my appetite. I don't eat a lot, only as per my appetite. So, I have gained some amount of muscle but also some disproportionate fat deposition around my lower abs and hips (because of a certain medical condition I have) which I am supposed to avoid. I do compound lifts 4 days a week, 3 sets of 10 reps. I don't have much time or equipment for cardio. Is there a way I can tweak my workout regime in terms of reps, etc. so that it causes greater fat burn and I can do without much cardio? 

I have a strength imbalance in both side of my hips as well as obliques. For this reason, I tend to descend somewhere towards left (my stronger side) and not in the middle during squats. I also find step ups more difficult on my weaker side. I have been to PT's, they couldn't fix it despite lots of sessions. Also, I can't afford for more. And trying to address obliques directly (like side planks) causes a lower back pain - it's more like pinching sensation. I have heard that treating it as problem in form may be a solution. Meaning reducing load to one in which I can maintain proper form and then working upwards should resolve the issue. Does this how it really works? I have been very sedentary due to lots of unresolved injuries for long. Looks like I'm a starter again and starting with very low weights now... 

No, they do not complete with each other for absorbtion and serve different functions. Glutamine will help shift your body from it's post workout catabolic state and will help with muscle repair and growth. Glutamine is a non-essential ammino acid which helps prevent the breakdown of muscle fiber. Creatine helps the muscle fiber store more H2O and ATP energy. Supplementing with creatine also helps muscle recover faster from working out. Protien: Glutamine is directly involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and breakdown. So how is it going to compete with protien? Also the protien you're taking contains ammino acids including glutamine so again, why would it compete? Glutamine is absorbed into the bloodstream, kidneys, liver and gut. Protien is processed in the stomache and then the intestine and finally absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract Creatine: Creatine is derived from 3 non essential amino acids: glycine, methionine and arginine. After ingestion, creatine binds with phosphates in your body to form creatine phosphates. This phosphate bound creatine molecule donates its own phosphate molecule with ADP to reform ATP. Creatine absorbtion can be increased by using carbohydrates. Most people use some type of juice. Also, are you going to be taking glutimine orally or through injections? 

Are there standard workout programs available for all-compound exercises using dumbbells? My goal is to improve functional strength. 

I find my right foot arch tends to flatten during lunges. How can I hold my arches? Any cues? There is no pain associated with this. I have imbalance of strength in both hips and legs. So, I incorporated single leg exercises in addition to squats and deadlifts.... 

I have a pair of dumbbells and access to a few machines. I can do the following exercises with proper form and I can't have a trainer to learn newer exercises now. Lower body: Lunges, Bulgarian split squat, step up, hamstring curls Abs and back: Back extension, plank, side plank Upper body: bench press / push up, chest flies, shoulder press, shoulder front and lateral raise, rear delt flies, rows (not sure about form though), lat pull I'm not able to figure out which pair of exercises balance each other and if all muscle groups get hit with the above exercises.

I have been doing an exercise which I came up with (not saying I invented it) that I have not seen before and I was wondering if there was a name for it. Imagine the cherry picker move we used to do in school. Similar to that. This also reminds me of a diagonal sit-up. Stand with your feet apart past shoulder width. Place a dumbell 5-10lbs at one foot. With the oposite hand, reach down and grab it. Using your lower back and abs, come back to a standing position keeping your back straight. The arm with the dumbell should track your leg (as if it were on a rail). The lower and repeat. When I'm doing 3 sets of 10 (10 lbs) or 2 sets of 10 (25 lbs) I can feel I've worked out my love handle area (internal obliques?). 

I have read about pull ups/chin up. Is there anything I can do with a barbell? My workout regime now consists of squats, deadlift, lunges, bench press, rows and overhead press. 

I have been following the below mentioned regime since June Upper Body (A) - Dumbbell Shoulder press, Incline Push ups, Barbell rows Lower body (B) - Goblet squat, Barbell deadlift, dumbbell lunges Rest (X) ABXABX, 10 reps and 3 sets for each lift I also used to do elbow planks, side plank and wrist curls (for wrist pain pain due to hypermobility). Since mid-July, I have stopped doing planks and my workout is like ABXABXX with wrist curls on upper body day. As a beginner who has hypermobile joints, I am lifting less weights and going very slow with progressions. I start each workout session with a bit a mobility work followed by 3 warm up sets, then 3 working sets, with 3-5 minutes of relevant stretches at the end. For not being able to complete reps, I had been doing shoulder presses to failure until a few days back when I got to know that as a beginner, I should avoid training to failure. I sleep for 6-8 hours at night. I have been reaping the benefits of lifting like better pain management for joints, increased weight, increased appetite. However, I have one major point of concern. I have a hormonal disorder that apparently gets aggravated due to mental or excess physical stress. And my symptoms are all over the place within a few days since I started lifting. I have started feeling anxious (and racing thoughts) without much reasons. My immunity is also off the place. I also get bruxism (teeth grinding) due to excess physical/mental stress - that has also come into picture now. Looking back, I somehow reach at lifting weights as a possible cause, although I'm not sure of it. I have tried taking 5-7 days off about 2-3 times but to no effect. Before I pay a visit to a doctor, I want to rule out overtraining. Could my workout schedule be possibly too much for a beginner in strength training?
