I have a group of settlers that live on top of an animal, and I want his skin to be their mode of communication. In the morning, information is transmitted through chromataphores in the skin changing color (don't ask how the info is interpreted, I'm still working on it), and at night use channels and nodes of bio-luminescent light from luciferin-superoxide reactions. My question is, is there a single chemical or system that can achieve both? 

Hatred is tied closely to stress. It is well-known that adrenaline is triggered by stress and changes bodily events, but it also affects genes. Over a period of time, stress will change our DNA. Usually, this is limited to things like cancer due to the DNA breaking down, but stress can affect gene expression. So this could happen either as new expression of a previously-unexpressed gene, or a change to an existing gene. Onto the eyes, there are actually people with red eyes. Albinism causes a strong lack of melanin, or human pigment, in the eyes causing light to bounce off blood vessels, leading people to see the color of the blood vessels as iris color. If you were to go this route, you could have the eyes naturally glow in dark light, since this very light eye color is highly reflective. You could also have your character possess a tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of cells sitting behind the retina that bounces light back so the retina can take in more information. This is what causes glowing eyes of cats and dogs in camera photos. Humans don't currently have tapetum lucidum, but it wouldn't be impossible, especially over time, for this to occur in humans. It also wouldn't be far-fetched to have a human pigment that causes red eye color. There are people with varying amounts of red hair, and there are plenty of other pigments found in animals, like foxes (and tomatoes too, but that's a stretch), that wouldn't be impossible for the body to synthesize. Unlike the Sharingan, this would only affect the iris and not the sclera, or white 'background' of the eyes. For bioluminescence, the principal pigment is the light-emitting luciferin, aided by the enzyme luciferase. This is usually the most potent form of bioluminescence, and most animals can't synthesize it on their own and must attain it through their diets, so a character would most likely need to inject themselves, therefore making the glowing eyes partially intentional, or a side effect from something else. However, through studying luciferin and bioluminescence, it was revealed that human cellular and chemical reactions also produce minimal amounts of light, so you could stretch plausibility a little bit and add chemicals to these reactions that naturally emit more light, etc. Stress could also cause adrenaline release, making these reactions emit more light than normally. The best explanation would probably be a mix of some of these. 

Pure brain/neurological power. How much time, in hours and age, it would take to become fluent in x disciplines. Plausibility assuming the person has an average 8-5-ish job with plenty of vacation and sick time and will live to 100. 

So I'm brainstorming a new magic system where each form of magic is specialized yet very versatile; however they require extremely in-depth knowledge on a particular multi-disciplinary branch of science, philosophy, math, arts and what-have-you. I don't really want to go too much into the magic system, because that's not the point of this question and I plan to ask further questions about it later. Examples: 

I ask a lot of questions in my answer not so you can answer me or give clarification, but so you have ideas and know what to think about when writing your story. Please don't disregard my answer for that alone. Anyhow... My first thought would be to make these faster zombies short-lived. If they are fast, this means that whatever made them zombies has avoided most of the muscular (and probably skeletal) system. Because the pathogen hasn't impacted their movement and metabolism as much as normal zombies, they burn more calories, are more active, and therefore go through more wear-and-tear than traditional zombies. A faster metabolism also means that these zombies need to consume more to maintain their energy. Naturally, this means they are more susceptible to starving, and would have to consume far more nutrients than a traditional zombie. And since they're zombies, perhaps whatever made them zombies also impacted their body's natural ability to analyze fat cells and the body randomly starts breaking down random pieces of flesh for energy (giving you an explanation if you wanted the traditional "bones showing through ripped jeans" look). You mentioned that the zombies are afraid of water. There are a couple variables you can play with here. For example, whether or not they're afraid of small amounts of water, like a liter, or if it requires a larger amount; if they're afraid of blood (more on this later), etc. There are other hazards that need to be considered as well, such as fear and damage from fire, sunlight, impact/puncture/slashing damage, sounds, general light, etc. So, blood. Zombies being afraid of blood opens up all sorts of possibilities. The first thing that came to mind was the potential of the survivors cutting themselves in order to release blood to scare away the zombies. This has all sorts of repercussions, like infection (especially to zombification), wasting of medical supplies, permanent physical damage preventing future escape or defense, psychological repercussions (and they, too, would eventually become numb to pain), etc. And do the zombies fear their own blood (if they have it), and if so, how does this affect feeding? Now, the others focused primarily on what makes these faster zombies weaker than traditional zombies. But first we have to decide what makes them stronger, as well as what makes zombies strong in the first place. Zombies often have strength in numbers. Hordes, mobs, gangs--whatever you want to call them--of zombies are much harder to defend against than a single or a handful of zombies. This pack mentality is a strength in that they know to gang up on survivors, but is also a weakness since these zombies fail to analyze their environment or formulate any other "strategy". Against hordes, limitations are mostly limited to marksmanship, ammo, strength/energy, fatigue and means of escape. A fast horde merely makes all these factors more important. Next I want to talk about durability. Exactly how much damage will your zombies be able to sustain before showing signs of weakening and eventually defeat? Will a headshot limit their motor abilities (or even kill them), will damage to any part of the body limit its use, and how much can they heal after "battle"? That last one is a big one I don't think many consider. Strategically, how much of their resources will the survivors put in to defeating zombies they meet in order to prevent them from coming back to get them? And if the zombies survive, will they be able to tell other zombies the survivors' location? (like how ants and bees can alert others)? Now, processing and computational ability. Just how much can zombies learn, analyze, perceive, process, etc.? Can they measure danger, and retreat to save their own lives? Do they even have instincts to survive, and if so, how much (and why would they go after humans if it means certain or a high chance of defeat (if they can think that much)? Before I mentioned a pack mentality, and psychology is a far overlooked element in zombie literature and media. Do they require others to process information and make decisions? Are there alpha males and beta females? Are there even genders? Is there a hive mind, or does the pathogen give them new instincts to go on? Do they have families, friends, relations, etc.? These can all cause strife on their own. Examples: a renegade from the hive, conflict for the position of alpha male, political events and political power, alliances/factions, etc. How is the virus spread? Is it airborne, intravenous? Does it use living vectors, like plants, natural bacteria (like the ones we have on our skin; this a big one, because if so, there's not much way to avoid it for long), or through asymptomatic/immune carriers (like a seemingly uninfected bird or dog)? Are they afraid of water because the pathogen can't spread over water? You mentioned various kinds of strains, and I would like you help you improve upon that. Assuming you know how the pathogen can spread, what if there were certain forms of zombies that acted like infantry and ran only to spread the virus (like suicide bio-bombers)? Plants and fungi are crucial topics. Can they spread through root systems and mutate the plants, creating spores or poison? Can they sense and communicate through plants? If you want fast zombies, perhaps they're just animal versions of these zombies. If the virus can affect multiple species, you could just have different variants that depend on the species, like air-bombing birds and espionage squirrels. That also brings up the topic of pets. A pet is another mouth to feed, and one requiring special food, but have superior abilities. They can alert the survivors to zombies using their superior senses. Birds can deliver messages (if they've traveled a route previously and are trained) and can do "reconnaissance". Dogs can attack as well as scavenge for food, as can cats. Perhaps reptiles and amphibians are immune to the virus (antidote, anyone?). Pets can also provide psychological support, which is direly needed in a situation as damaging as this. Remember, power is not just in destructive capability but in all results that can be achieved. I might add a little more after submitting, since this was a very long-winded answer. But I had a ton of fun writing it, so thanks! 

There are a couple of branches of this question, making it harder to answer coherently, but here I go. If you want to make a league of gentlemen out of the general criminal underworld, you would first make them organized, into a criminal organization. For that, you'd need a charismatic leader, people who will follow that leader, and new recruits who need or gain something by joining this group. For example, a gang starting with a man with leadership skills, organizes his loyal friends (or maybe contacts, I'm not fluent in the social expectations of the criminal underbelly), and then you get people off the streets who need the money or just a job. Freakonomics, a non-fiction book that uses the rules of economics to explain otherwise-unexplainable phenomena has a chapter about a gang based on drug dealing, and it was built much like a corporate organization. Someone was calling the shots (like a CEO), some people had power and important responsibilities, like managing recruiting or drug intake and outflow (the board of directors), important higher-ups like drug-transporters and local recruiters (like department or store managers), and then you had the "bottom feeders", the actual dealers who were paid the least and could be easily replaced, but took the dangerous job for financial purposes (retail-floor workers). So now you've got an (very) organized group involved in crime. It has strong footholds, loyal members, safety nets, a wide network, spies even, etc. They exist because something, usually a practice or good, wasn't legal (if it were legal, it wouldn't be as appealing or profitable to the originator of the criminal organization, or the alternative is they're a legal organization). Like drug or human trafficking. And even though their actions often are directly harmful to people and/or require violence and murder to enforce their territory, sometimes they were benevolent. Mafia families did actually have a sense of family and loyalty among their own families, and were said to have arranged marriages for alliances just like historic royalties. And both gangs and mafias did follow through on the "protection" they charged for, defending stores that paid the protection fee from criminals or rival gangs. So criminal organizations did actions for revenge, to preserve their own existence, and profit. It doesn't make much sense for a criminal organization to go story-book evil or serial-killer psychotic and harm people for no reason. But turning them into the good guys is likely very conditional and challenging. Let's talk about Suicide Squad first. It's a special operations task force made from skilled supervillains and supercriminals on a work-release program. Some notables are Bane, Black Adam, and in the movie, Harley Quinn and the Joker. Their motivation is they get to shorten their prison sentences by performing covert tasks for the government. They also probably find it fun, as it can be similar to their crime life and the thrill is just great for supervillains. Most long-time criminals pick up something while they're in the business. Drug-dealers may learn sales skills, for example. They also may perform their criminal duty in the opposite direction, like hackers working to prevent other hackers from succeeding and Frank Abagnale, whose story was adapted in Catch Me If You Can, used his skills in faking identities to help stop identity theft. The problem with retribution prison that the US has is that criminals often become law-abiding citizens and either lack the skills and education to get a job or it's impossible to get a job, and so they return to crime, as they've learned to be good at it, and it's all they know. Give them a legal job requiring their skills and make it just as or even more profitable than their criminal one, and you've good a good guy. But if you want to turn a whole criminal organization into a legal league of gentlemen, well then you have to do that on a macro-scale and be sure that the organization can still exist in the legal world. The Prohibition era mafia families fell into disarray because there wasn't any room for a smuggling and distribution operation like them; those facets of the economy were already in place. You would have to make sure that leadership is stable and that the legal side of business is profitable and appealing. For example, Anonymous, a very well-known hacking group, has accomplished hacking feats far superior than both the NSA and FBI and manage to hide their traces better. You could employ them directly into the NSA and FBI or make them an independent branch on their own, or maybe even an exclusive contractor. I'm sure there are other organizations I'm not aware of or are still underground, but they also fit this bill. Far easier though, is to make this organization a vigilante league of gentlemen. Essentially chaotic good anti-heroes, they can steal from those deemed evil or corrupt and give to those in need. Pretty Boy Floyd was a bank robber who gained appeal and praise from citizens by burning the records of their mortgages and debts. Some gangsters, like Mickey Spillane had the media perception of a "gentlemen", and avoided violence when he could and never allowed drug trade or violent mobs in his territory. So change their business from selling illicit drugs smuggled in or grown/made locally to stealing from pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies and selling necessary and helpful over-priced prescription at a far lower price or for free. The only people who really suffer are the owners, share-owners, and high-higher-ups in this corporate conglomerate, so nobody good is getting hurt. This is sometimes how revolutionary sides or rebels act, actually, during civil wars. There are stories all over, but I don't want to quote anything because there wasn't a completely benevolent revolutionary side. So, to recap and summarize. A for-profit organization starts when there is a profitable business or source of income, and it's built when there are different responsibilities that need to be fulfilled in order to maximize profits. If the business is legal, then the organization is legal, and have monopoly through patents, non-compete agreements, oligopolies or "industrial hegemonies", etc. They may also have government regulations. If the business is deemed illegal, then the organization is illegal, and each criminal organization often controls the different facets of production, like imports all the way the distribution, and have no regulations (since the whole practice is illegal). To make them legal, give them a niche to fit into within the legal world, like the aforementioned hackers becoming anti-hackers or drug-dealers becoming salesman, or if you're not going for realism, trained killers doing government-sanctioned trained-killing. To make them gentlemanly but not legal, make their source of profit harm the guilty or those who won't suffer too much (like uber-rich) and ensure that it doesn't harm the innocent and needy, and make sure their goal is to help those in need. 

I'm interested in knowing how many disciplines, including science and languages, a single human could become "fluent" in, such that they have at least a MA, and then a Ph. D. I'd like to know in regards to: 

See, I have a magic system and most people can practice a decent amount of power. There are two primary kinds of mage. Sorcerers can give their mana different properties (like making it sticky, solid, etc.) and convert their mana directly into various forms energy, but lack the ability to completely manipulate external forces. Wizards use spells for specific magical effects, like sending out a concussive wave. Prophets/PHEts (People of the Higher Entities) are uncommon people who can perform powerful miracles (like curing cancer) and/or curses (like causing a generation's first-born to always become a serial killer), but must be chosen by this higher being. One could also make a contract with a magical being, like a fairy or demon, to share their magic power. Depending on the contract and strength of the creature, they usually can outperform most average and skilled mages. The most rare magic practitioners are called Magi. There are Magicians who can practice both sorcery and wizardry (and sometimes even miracles and curses), Warlocks who have a formidable innate talent (like controlling the weather), Chains who can bind other living creatures to their will, and Chaotics who can affect probability and change the balance of entropy and use hexes to cause good or bad luck. Arcs are those who wield ancient forms of magic, similar to modern sorcery and wizardry but blurring the lines between them and possess various unique attributes (like fusing with nature or local space/time/spacetime distortion). I imagine magic primarily being done small-scale, like affecting what's in one's line of sight, speeding up or easing mundane tasks, etc. Large magical feats like conjuring/destroying a building require many people and extra magical fuel, or an exceedingly powerful Magus. However, magic cannot be automated and every magic sequence or spell requires an active casting. However, I still want a society based on technology and focused on advancing technology, either modern day or 20 Minutes in the Future.. For what reasons could technological advancement (and its motivation) be resistant to magic?
