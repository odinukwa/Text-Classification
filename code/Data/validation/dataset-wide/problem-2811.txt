As close to the categorical imperative this formulation may seem, it’s still reductive and leads finally to misreading what constitutes the nerve in the metaphysics of morals. The collective interest of humanity does not suffice in defining moral duty. Kant explains it clearly: 

– Utilitarian ethics. NB: Reasons are not important, only consequences. You cannot see or measure the motives of people, but only the consequences of their actions. 

The axes of research and intervention on man are of interest – the manner techno science changes our image and modifies our body. In itself, there is no need to be "posthuman", "transhumanist" or something else to feel like making a genetical test on your embryo, to follow a cellular therapy, operate aesthetical modifications and so forth; yet, it’s this sum of small things in all sorts of domains that people start to create by need or desire that gradually diverge human evolution. For the sake of answering your question: Transhuman is a process, a transitional state. Posthuman is a result. Etymology suffices to clarify the difference between "trans" and "post": transhumanism aims the improvement of man, whereas posthumanism seeks to surpass it. The transhuman process position might be aimed towards a clear goal (maybe a posthumanism), or a sort of shifting where we accumulate and test, often with negative and positive restrictions in some directions, typical of pragmatical positions that pretend to be without ideology in adapting the one of the moment. Obviously, I object this position that pretends to be disideologized and that details very rarely what it means by a certain foundational concept. 

Great question. There is nothing inherently wrong with interpreting “->” as “if...then.” Paradoxes of material implication arise from an incorrect translation of observation to symbolic logic. In the example given, we have a system of two closed switches resulting in one illuminated light bulb and we want to describe a truth about this system within symbolic logic. There is only one thing that we can know based on this observation - namely: 

In the political arena, those who are anti-abortion characterize their position as “pro-life.” In this way, opponents of abortion are setting up a straw man argument implying that their opponents are not in favor of human life.” In reality, the question behind the abortion debate is not whether or not human life is valuable, but when human life begins and what social values are jeopardized in undermining a woman's right to decide these matters. An effective way of debating and defusing “straw man” rhetoric, is by graciously and wholeheartedly agreeing with the opponent as much as possible. In a public forum debate about chocolate ice cream, Joey should follow up Nick's argument with an eloquent and gracious support for the value of freedom (ie: “I would like to thank Nick for the important values he articulated so eloquently; it's heartening to see that what we agree upon is far more important than the differences that divide us....”). Similarly, in the abortion debate, those in favor of a woman’s right to choose should graciously applaud the tireless humanitarian efforts and idealistic values of the “pro-life” movement. 

For pragmatists, the social context in which a thought is born and interpreted gives its meaning and signpost, hence the uselessness of the seal of the absolute. Rorty insists on the fact that pragmatism is an “anti-essentialism”. In this perspective, the philosophical undertaking does not consist in a search of the essence of things, but more of the relations that a thing has with the rest of its environment. The anti-essentialists abolish the metaphysical distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic, in the sense that, for them, there is no characteristic that is more essential than another in the study of an object. To demonstrate his point, Rorty takes as example the number 17: 

Thus, to avoid all ambiguity, maybe it would be more suitable to replace the term “relativist” by the one Rorty employs to categorize thinkers like William James, John Dewey and Michel Foucault: “pan-relationalism”. In the ways relativism and absolutism are generally presented, the choice between these two notions come to two dead-ends: “the absence of possible discussion” and “the faith in abstractions”. If we can question the idea of replacing categories in the heart of philosophical tradition, pragmatism nevertheless highlights the necessity in defining them better. 

Is it "possible" to accept a retributive theory of punishment, while simultaneously accepting a deterministic view of human behavior? Is belief in freewill a necessary condition for a belief that retributive punishments are ethical/correct? Under what set of assumptions are these ideas compatible? 

It's often easier to argue on what someone doesn't believe than what they do believe. The straw man argument is characterized by a misrepresentation of an opponent's viewpoint to make for easier and more eloquent criticism of that opinion. In the following example from the movie “Thank You for Smoking,” notice how Nick characterizes Joey's position as "anti-choice" which is absurd and meaningless in the context of their original debate: 

In other words: If two switches are closed then the light bulb will be illuminated. Now, the words “if two switches are closed” are not two propositions, they are one proposition. The words "if two switches are closed" is a binary proposition that adheres perfectly to the law of the excluded middle. Any system of two switches either satisfies the condition “two switches are closed” or does not. Therefore, the only logically correct way to represent this true observation about switches and illumination is in the form where stands for the system of two closed switches and Q the illuminated light bulb. is wrong because one observed system state can not yield two binary propositions causing a result. From one observed state you may get only one “if...then” in the form of . 

When you refer to the I of the past what are you referring to? Think on this question. What the I of the past is, and how it exists in the present is mostly in the form of a conversation. There is the present where the body is acting, but something is referencing the past in some fashion. As Douglas Hofstadter says in I Am A Strange Loop: 

There have been many answers to this question, and I suppose at this point, mine will be just another body on the pile, but I think there is something fundamental that hasn't been addressed (unless I missed it). That is: Who is this God you're talking about? Is he an old white man with a long beard who looks suspiciously like the archetypal authoritarian father we all have learned to love and fear? Or is it just the notion that there was a being who could be considered the first cause? Is it really just the notion that some people accept a literal notion of the bible (who I suspect are actually fewer than we've been led to believe)? Is it the traditional notion of God as the judge - he who controls our fate and promises to decide are afterlife after death? I'm neither religious nor positional about this issue. There are so many things that we can't fathom that it seems just as silly to argue that the absolute truth is empirically graspable (and only so) as it does to argue the alternative. Even our own thoughts are something we are helplessly unfamiliar with - I'm reminded of a Woody Allen quote:
