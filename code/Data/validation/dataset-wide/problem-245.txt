I'm no expert but I believe that more gravity would result in faster compression of carbon substances (dead things) and therefor more oil and other fossil fuels would be produced. This would make up for the excess amount of fuel needed to power the much more powerful engines needed for flight in such a place. As for the question of flying creatures, yes, they will develop, but they would look strange to us as they will have had to adapt to the gravity there. They will probably be large winged and small bodied in order to make up for the mass to propellant ratio. 

First of all, go to YouTube and search why do rivers curve, and click on the fist one. I found this video very helpful. Most of what I can tell you is from that video, so here are some key points: The length of one "s" in a river is roughly six times the width of the river. If any disturbances are in the way, the river will simply go around the disturbance. A meander can be caused by nearly anything, so they ate quite common. Sometimes the s will be thinner than others because it has formed an oxbow lake. 

"...any need for a platoon/company of Humans which are unable to use modern technology?" Absolutely! Though I'm not sure how this will aid your story. Remember that the vast majority of a military force is not combat-focused. You have cooks, mechanics, logistics people, supply, medical, finance, intelligence, and so on. Only about one percent of a modern military actually does the shooting and killing. Now, I imagine you want your character to be in on the action, which makes being a cook not sound that exciting. But if they aren't going to be 'strong' (able to effect change, be powerful, use weapons) they could be smart. Though in such a world, I would expect their scientists would be able to find a way to extract and capture that which powers all these things. Perhaps it isn't easy, or efficient, but you'd have a way to bottle it into small 'charges,' allowing a non-gifted character to fire a few shots from a sidearm or something along these lines. 

Edit: I remembered something from my science class. It goes something like this: Trees use the energy they collect from photosynthesis to pump water into all the parts. This water helps the tree grow. If a tree grows to a certain point, the amount of energy needed to pump the water that high exceeds the energy they get from photosynthesis. At this point, trees stop growing. For these trees to grow as tall as they need to be, you will probably have to make them broad-leafed (so they get more energy from photosynthesis) and again have lower gravity (to make it easier for the water to travel up from the roots). 

I am trying to establish a few guidelines for a story I recently started jotting down, based in a seafaring city-state. The setting is a fantasy world and I would like to have some degree of realism in how they go from year 0 when the first settlers land on my island in a primitive canoe to year 4000 when they build ships that have a crew of hundreds and use sails as primary propulsion method. Being ignorant in the matter I looked up the maritime history of the world and tried to sum it up in the following timeline. 

You are already considerably wealthy and well connected (this implies that the job in Lycania would make you filthy rich in a few years' time by the way) 

There are two approaches you could take with this. Science If your saying they downright don't need to be trees then it makes this a little easier to solve. I'm going to assume that all you care about is the fact that this is some sort of tree-like vegetation. This means the material the trees are made of could be different than our trees. Assuming you could make up a material that is light enough to grow this big without being crushed under it's own weight, strong enough to hold the weight of an entire city, and have a planet with a gravitational pull weak enough to make it all possible, it could work. (Also note that having a weak gravitational pull can also make it easier for elves to get around on trees such as the ones you describe) Fantasy This is a fantasy world and you are talking about elves, a magical race, so clearly this story contains magic, right? This makes it even easier to solve as some ancient elves may have enchanted this species of trees to make them capable of withstanding their own weight at that size. This could also add an interesting element to the story. You could even include the legend of how the trees got to be so big. 

I'm trying to find a common or easily transmitted illness that would prevent a person from eating for several days (or keeping down/digesting food). I know there are a lot of things that can make eating difficult or unpleasant, but I need something with a better success rate. It would also need to be treatable. Essentially, I have a plot point that revolves around killing off a portion of the population who are 'infected' for lack of a better explanation. The infected have almost zero percent body-fat, which means they would starve quickly, while 'normal' people would just be very hungry (and sick). Sadly, I'm not a pathologist, and I'm not sure how I would format this question to search Google. Thanks! 

Your means are such that your purchase power and connections are those of an average working class person 

You're planning to move to the rich country of Lycania (names are a work in progress, ok?), a country as big as the USA plus half of Canada, where you have been offered a good position which would make you earn far more than your current job, giving you an alternative to a mediocre life. Lycania is the one true first world country in a slowly decaying world, and there are people who would [literally] kill to live there. 

You want desperately to take the job, but you wouldn't mind surviving decently past the age of <insert your age here>. You (individually and/or via your employer who will likely offer a solution to help you as part of the benefits) need a plan that can guarantee you high chances of survival (>90%) for multiple full moons - ideally an infinite amount of them, but if you make it for a few months you'll have been around long enough to find alternatives as well, and will have saved enough to have better alternatives. As it may have a huge impact, you can consider two separate cases: 

I have to point out that modern military body armor does a wonderful job protecting the wearer from direct gunfire, and it is specially designed to defeat military weapons. The US military uses armor consisting of ridged plates able to defeat 7.62mm rounds, the type commonly used in the AK-47. Surrounding the plates and covering areas not protected by plates, you'll find kevlar panels able to defeat some small caliber weapons, as well as providing protection from shrapnel. For a creature that only needs to protect its heart, I would still recommend it wears standard military body armor. The ballistic plates are designed to protect the vital organs, but shrinking those plates would expose the heart to gunfire from off-angle attacks (45 degrees). Bullets also tend to bounce around inside the body, so it is possible for a round to hit in the hip and then redirect up through the chest cavity, for example. Because of this, maximizing protection is always a good idea. I wouldn't expect any type of armor to defeat a .50 though. The sheer kinetic force would likely crush the chest cavity, destroying the heart if you were able to stop it. Your creatures would gain the advantage of shedding helmets though. A standard plate carrier (unlike a vest, it only carries plates, and doesn't have the bulk or restrictions to movement) equipped with side plates would be my recommendation.
