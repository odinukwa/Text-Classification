There's several good answers about dehydration, I thought I'd talk a bit about watching for low electrolytes - I found myself benefiting a great deal from adding some to my drinks even when my activity is fairly mild, so I disagree with the assertion that they are only useful in extreme cases. One thing to watch for is, as Karen mentioned in a comment, that too much water and not enough salt feels "sloshy". It feels like the water isn't helping, or like you haven't drunk enough or you have symptoms of low water even if you've drunk a lot and you feel heavy with the water, or you feel a bit nauseous and disinclined to drink even though you need it (sweating, etc). Another thing to watch for is wanting salt - like feeling foods are under-salted, or craving salty snacks. This can be rather subtle, it's easier to catch in retrospect than at the time since it meddles with perception, and instead of feeling like you need more it may well feel like you've just had less. This can also show up as wanting to eat - as in, the aforementioned sloshy feeling gets better if one eats between water breaks, but the salt level of the food tends to (in retrospect) matter more than the bulk. Salt (specifically, sodium) is one of the primary electrolytes, and relatively easy for the body to poke one to go looking for. Another possible symptom is fatigue, fuzzy-mindedness, difficulty concentrating, (slightly) blurred vision, or even headaches. Again, this can be pretty subtle, especially if it's mild - I actually only noticed the absence of such after I started adding salt to some of my drinks. A last possibility, and the easiest and most accurate, is to just add a bit of salt to your drink (half teaspoon or less per quart) - if it helps, then you needed it. If it tastes or feels good than it is probably worth adding salt to your water again, and paying attention to see if it helps in other ways - especially if the sensation is quite dramatic, that is one of the ways the body can communicate "yes, we need this". If salt intake in other areas (meals, etc) starts decreasing once you add a bit of salt to your drinks, then your salt intake is likely driven by need rather than desire, if it balances itself once you have enough. It's worth trying out, carrying a small water bottle laced with salt, etc - adding lemon and/or sugar are popular, salty lemonade is one of the easiest electrolyte drinks - or even just a tuck some salt, sugar, lemon packets, into a bag or pocket which you can mix into some water if you think you need it, which costs very little space or weight. The occasional sip when exerting can help you figure out how the body feels if or when you need electrolytes - if you want pure water, you're likely fine, if (after a bit of walking) the salty lemonade seems like the best idea ever - especially if it seems much more appealing than before you started sweating - then you likely need the salts. For myself, the first time I had salty lemonade it was eye-crossingly good, once I started adding salt to my drinks regularly it backed off to merely pleasant - since the body felt it no longer needed to hit me over the head to get enough. If it does help you, you can think about lacing your primary water supply, or looking for more elaborate mixes (potassium and calcium salts are next in importance, then those needed in trace amounts like magnesium etc). Or you can carry a small amount of something to mix with your water if/when you need it. 

I would generally agree with the "as few as possible approach", but would add that if it is a question of safety or avoiding lots of time wasted (which in turn may morph into a safety issue), then I think markers can be helpful. But I don't think it should be exaggerated - markers can be used instead of cairns. For example in Vistasvaggi (Vistas Valley) in North Sweden, there are fairly inconspicuous markers in the form of two half buried brick-sized red-brown rocks close to each other. I didn't understand they were markers until I had seen a few. Of course you can argue it is hard to get lost even in a wide valley and it certainly is at large scale, but I found it helpful to get the detail right when going over soggy ground, tired and damp. 

Agree with ppl, don't think it is a big problem, but even for variable filling bags it could mean that some of that expensive down may not be used the way you would prefer. A quilt may be a bit draugthy if you are not careful. I find the bottomless bags work well for 3 seasons. An(other) option there is a Rab "Backless" bag; have tried the predecessor, the Q-Top. Alternatively one could sew in a piece of thin nylon fabric under a quilt fairly easily. What I really wanted to add was that if you don't squirm around too much at night, the best all-rounder might be a sleeping bag without baffles in the rings of fabric you lie inside, ie. only baffles in the head-toe direction (Western Mountaineering calls it "continuous baffle" design). With those you are free to turn it upside down and shake all or as much of the down as you like to the top part of the bag. So the same bag could be bottomless or have slightly more insulation underneath, depending on what you need. 

Are there some general "dos and don'ts" for setting up a dual skin tents or popup tents or tents on sloping sand? 

I've recently learned that linen underwear is great against fungal infections that can be contracted in hot sweaty conditions. But elsewhere I had read that the best fabrics against sweaty or tropical conditions were synthetic fabrics that provide wicking thus preventing excess moisture build up. I just arrived in Taiwan where it's 34°C/93°F and plan to hitchhike around Asia for a year, as I've done before. Previously my biggest problem had been chafing. I've managed to find some synthetic short and trousers, so it should be better this year. But I'm also concerned about fungal infection. I get tinea pedis frequently when wearing shoes and I've had tinea cruris before and think that could be a showstopper for long distance walking in hot/tropical climates. But so far I still only have cotton underwear. Is synthetic preferable? I think I read somewhere that polyester is the worst in regard to jock itch! Or what about going with linen when not actively hiking and something else while out on the road? 

I was lucky enough to be given an almost new double skin popup tent. Where I'm camping right now it's got windy a couple of times and rainy a couple of times. A friend of mine who is camping in his (several seasons old) dome tent says he thinks they're an inherently better design than popup tents against wind. But is this necessarily true? Is it generally considered that popup tents have a particular set of advantages and disadvantages in comparison to dome tents? ... apart from these points which I think are obvious:
