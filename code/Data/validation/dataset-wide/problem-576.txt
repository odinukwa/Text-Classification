There's no right/wrong answer. Just make sure you have some sort of towel available so you can wipe your hands before riding. What I generally do is place dabs on the chamois and rub the sides together to spread it around -- keeps the hands relatively clean and doesn't require a separate applicator. Some people prefer to rub it on their butt. I don't use a lot -- maybe a half ounce (about 15 cc, IIRC). Others use much more, maybe 2 oz. 

Not directly relevant to your question, but it may provide some insight: I have a medical condition (post-polio syndrome) which is causing me to lose muscle strength. As a result, I'm starting to have difficulty sometimes starting out from a standing stop. My left leg is about 30% weaker than my right leg, but my inclination is to stand on my right leg, clip in my left leg, and then start out, with my first downstroke on the left (weak) leg. But I'm becoming convinced I'd do better if I can train myself to do it the opposite way (which I've just started working on). The thing is, when standing on one leg, you tend to want to stand on your stronger leg, without thinking of what you'll be doing next, and whether you'll need that stronger leg for a different activity. I suspect that you similarly are more comfortable with your weight on the stronger leg, even though you really need that stronger leg in the "awkward" position so that it's instantly available for power. 

I think they still do exist, but are much less common, and in a much improved design. The old design (as pictured) would "bottom out" very easily, especially given the flex in the lever. So they didn't provide very effective braking. In fact, I'm thinking that the CPSC had something to do with their disappearance, by requiring that they be demonstrated to be effective, essentially eliminating the cheaper models (which comprised about 99% of those made). In addition, the drop handlebar fell out of fashion for casual riding, where the levers would be most useful. 

The EXPERIENCED CYCLIST, who is not, eg, out of shape after a long winter does not need any food for 50 road miles. This is because his muscles and liver have "learned" to store extra sugar/carbs to provide energy over a long period of time. But a beginning cyclist who is not, say, already a distance runner or otherwise used to exercising vigorously for several hours DOES need some extra carbs along the way to keep his blood sugar up, not, perhaps, for a 25 mile ride, but for a 50 mile one. (Note, you DON'T want large amounts of fat or protein -- these do nothing to help your sugar levels and they are hard to digest.) The form of the carbs is not especially critical, other than the food should be chosen for convenience, neatness (you don't, eg, want chocolate smeared all over your hands), and personal taste. Avoid foods with any significant amount of fat, and avoid spicy or strongly flavored foods -- these may seem appetizing at the store but do not go down well or "sit" well on the road, especially if you allow yourself to become a hair dehydrated (which of course you shouldn't do, but it happens). A modest amount of salt is desired, but too much (without enough water) can send your stomach on a spin. (The nut-raisin snack, by itself, is just a tad "heavy" for my taste, and may be a hair too heavy in terms of fat. But as one of a small variety of snacks it's fine, and likely a decent source of salt.) I would say figure on about 500 calories of mostly carb snacks for a 50-mile, 3-hour ride. This isn't nearly enough to replace the calories you burn, but it is enough to prevent a low blood sugar condition. And, of course, HYDRATE! 

In general, you can't replace rim brakes with hub or disk brakes unless the frame is designed for that. In particular, hub or rim brakes place too much stress on the front fork unless the fork is designed for them. You're probably better off buying a new bike with the "right" (for you) brakes factory-installed. But I'm surprised that you have so much trouble with rim brakes. I just had my rim brake pads replaced for the first time last year, after putting about 10,000 miles on my current bike. 

Everything stretches under load. How much is the question. The belt manufacturers should have technical data, including stress/strain graphs, modulus numbers, or other "hard" numbers. But, generally speaking, carbon fiber and steel both have a modulus of around 200. It's not clear now much carbon fiber is in the belts (and the cross-section area times the modulus effectively tells you how much stretch will occur), but when you consider the thinnest parts of a steel chain, and the fact that the pins will tend to flex in tension, it's probably comparable. In any event, stretching should not be a concern so long as it's not sufficient to cause the belt to skip on the cog, or some other mechanical issue. 

I wear only CoolMax socks. I find they do a good job of keeping my feet dry and non-sweaty, and they don't tend to mat -- they maintain some "loft" and padding ability, even after hours of riding. They also wear like iron. The only down-side is that they get dingy looking fairly quickly. I prefer the low-rise style (just above the ankle), but that's in part because I have a mild sensory processing disorder and find high-rise socks uncomfortable in all contexts. Color doesn't matter to me -- I generally go for muted colors because I'm color blind and can't tell what color combo looks good and what doesn't. 

First you need to analyze the pavement a bit -- smooth pavement or rough, is it generally pretty clean or is there a light coating of sand or dust, or perhaps a heavy coating? Narrow, high-pressure bike tires do not "hydroplane" at non-supersonic speeds, so you don't need to worry about that. But there is still a thin layer of water between tire and road surface, sufficient to impact the coefficient of friction, and some sort of "tread" or "siping" helps significantly. Any dust or sand exacerbates the problem, and a smooth surface (especially worn-smooth asphalt) can get treacherous. I don't know of any hard numbers (though I would suspect they're out there somewhere), but Wikipedia has this to say (about auto tires): 

When you hit a bump, with no avoidance maneuver, the front wheel is forced up abruptly, and most of that force is transferred to the cyclist's body. When the rear wheel later hits the same bump, at normal cycling speeds, the cyclist's body is still "up in the air" from the front wheel bump, and much less force is transmitted. 

Basically, the tube box will list the sizes it covers. Make sure your size is within those parameters (and ideally not "on the edge"). Beyond that you'd generally pick the lighter tube for road and the heavier one for off-road. And a heavier tube will generally provide a slight improvement in puncture resistance. Avoid very light tubes unless you're a racer, as they will often "leak down" much faster than heavier tubes, requiring you to inflate your tires twice daily in some cases. (It would be nice if manufacturers rated their tubes based on leakage.) 

I think we had an earlier question on this and I broke it down based on what you're trying to prevent. 

Next time you get a flat, take the tube out but keep track of which is side is left and which is right relative to the bike (and mark it). Inflate the tube, outside of the tire, to about 1.5 or 2x its normal diameter, then immerse it in a basin of water and find the leak. A leak on the inner diameter indicates a missing/defective rim strip, or a spoke that has been dislodged and is poking the tube. A leak around the valve is likely due to under-inflation or lack of care mounting the tire. Two leaks closely spaced together near one side of the tube is "snakebite" and indicates hitting curbs, etc, while the tire is insufficiently inflated. And of course, a leak from the valve itself is due to a defective valve or one where the core is not tightly screwed in. You may also find leaks where you damaged the tube during installation -- especially likely if you used screwdrivers to mount the tire. After you find the leak (and the cause is not obvious), place the tube, with the hole marked, alongside the tire and find the corresponding point in the tire. Check from the inside (both look and feel it with your hand) for any piece of wire or glass or whatever that might be stuck in the tire tread and poking through. 

First off, in order for there to be any sort of a "crisis", both bolts would have to fail, an unlikely possibility on a reasonably well-maintained bike. But, beyond that, the integrity of the frame doesn't depend on the BB shell resisting twisting loads. Rather, due to the "truss" nature of the standard bike frame (tandem or not), the load on the shell is almost totally "radial" -- force into or away from the shell. While this force would tend to "pry" the shell open, it's very unlikely to be substantial enough to cause catastrophic failure. 

Use the garden hose without sprayer, just using your thumb to spray. Avoid spraying hard/long at bearing areas. And when you do spray at a bearing, do it obliquely, not straight into the bearing. Or just let the bike be dirty. That doesn't hurt it either. (Compressed air can damage a bike too, if used improperly, by driving dirt into the bearings.) 

We need to introduce some basic physics here... The "angle of thrust" -- the angle between the ground and the line running from the tire contact point up to the center of gravity of bike+rider -- is determined solely by the speed and the radius of the turn. The downward pressure at the tire will, on a reasonably bump-free road, be precisely the weight of bike+rider (divided between the two tires, of course), while the outward pressure -- the tendency to skid out, as it were -- will be determined by the laws of centrifugal force. If you know those two forces you can use the squaw on the hippopotamus to compute the "thrust" along the center-of-gravity line, and you can use trig to figure out what the angle to the horizontal is. So whether the cyclist leans in or out makes zero difference in the thrust (and tendency to want to skid out) -- it's purely determined by speed and turn radius. With an essentially cylindrical tire cross-section, the amount of friction (to resist skidding out) will be primarily determined by the coefficient of friction of the tire material and the downward weight on the tire. Since a road tire has essentially the same coefficient of friction over its entire usable surface, the "lean" of the tire has little effect on traction. There will be some degree of effect on traction based on how close to the rim one is, and how the tire is deforming -- it could be reasonably argued that as a tire is leaned and deforms sideways more it will "squirm" more, resulting in some loss of traction. But this effect would be slight on high-pressure road tires. The two major effects to consider here are more mechanical. One is the way the geometry of the bike+rider changes as the bike traverses minor bumps, and the other is the way that steering behaves. With regard to the bumps, consider two cases: 1) The bike is essentially vertical, with the rider leaning into the turn to achieve the right angle of thrust. 2) The rider attempts to stay vertical while leaning the bike (and necessarily the lower portion of his body) into the turn. In the first case, when a bump is encountered, the bike will be pushed upward, with the "pivot" of the rider's body bending to absorb the shock. There will be little change in the overall "geometry" of the "system" (though there may be some change in the geometry of the rider's back, requiring chiropractic services to correct). In the second case, the rider will remain relatively motionless while the angle of bike to road changes dramatically. I think it's clear that, other factors being equal, the second case will result in a less stable behavior. With regard to steering behavior, consider how much change in direction occurs for a minor change in steering angle. With the bike essentially vertical the radius of the turn is determined almost completely by the steering angle. It takes a relatively major change in steering angle to effect a change in turn radius. On the other hand, with the bike leaning the radius of the turn is affected by the curve of the bike tire -- as the steering angle increases the point at which the tire touches the road moves forward along the wheel diameter, so that a minor change in steering angle produces a much more pronounced change in turn radius. But an interesting side-effect of this is that as the bike leans more it tends to turn more sharply, and turning more sharply increases outward thrust, tending to right the bike. This results in a relatively stable steering configuration. The net-net of this to me is that on a relatively smooth road you'd want to lean the bike "naturally", to achieve optimal stability (not only for speed/safety but also to reduce rider fatigue). However, on a less ideal surface one might not want to lean so far. (Of course, a relatively prudent rider would not ride as fast on poor surfaces anyway, so naturally there would be less leaning.) But I suspect that a lot of how people ride (including the rider in that video) has to do more with body mechanics than bicycle mechanics. On a long downhill the rider is taking the opportunity to rest, but also having to be ultra-alert to avoid wiping out. Certain body configurations will permit more relaxation/recovery of the major muscles while at the same time optimizing control and the ability to comfortably "ride out" the shocks that one experiences at high speeds even on a "smooth" road. 

I'd say no sweat -- the bike can handle you and another 100kg, so long as you don't go off-roading with it or some such. The wheels appear to be 36-spoke and plenty wide, so they can easily handle the weight. The frame is a standard diamond, the strongest design you'll find. No fancy suspension to bottom out or break. Barring a manufacturing defect or incredibly poor materials probably the seat will be the first thing to wear out. Do get it an annual checkup at your local bike shop, though, if you end up using it regularly. Update: The changes to the original post affect what I said above to some degree. The "new" bike has an aluminum frame and front suspension. The Al frame is a bit more apt to fatigue over time, especially if overloaded (though a 120kg rider is not really "overloading"). Of slightly more concern would be how well the front suspension handles the load, something that is hard to judge. The bike is most probably OK for a 120kg rider, but questionable for, say, a 180kg rider. 

The main disadvantage to either toe clips or (even moreso) clipless pedals is that until you get used to them you're likely to have a few rather inelegant falls (like pulling up to a stoplight and just falling over). There are other cases where they can contribute to falls (or exacerbate falls that would have occurred anyway), particularly in off-road conditions (which is one reason that off-road bikers often don't use them). To me (being partly disabled) the main advantage is that I expend less energy keeping my feet on the pedals. This isn't as trivial as it sounds: Without some sort of retention system you must constantly work to keep your feet centered over the pedals -- get off-center and your foot slides off. Of course, people mostly manage this unconsciously, but it still takes considerable effort/energy, especially when you're tired or struggling against a hill or headwind or whatever. The ability to "pull" on the pedal and gain energy on the upstroke is probably not significant in the general case, but can be important when you need a brief burst of power/torque. More important, and somewhat related to the previous paragraph, is the fact that you can extend your power stroke slightly, beginning a few degrees earlier and ending a few degrees later. You don't get more peak torque, but you do get more energy per unit time. 

I've never played with tubeless bike tires, but I assume there are conceptual similarities to tubeless auto tires. First off, a tubeless tire isn't really tubeless -- there is a "tube" (thin layer of solid rubber) laminated to the inside of the tire to contain the air. Presumably the sealant you have would serve the same purpose, but it's not clear how well. Second, the tubeless tire has a specially-designed bead area, smoother than a tube-type tire and designed to seal tightly to the rim. Your typical bike tire has a fairly rough bead area, and not one that would naturally make a tight seal. But again, the sealant may make up for this to a degree. As to the sidewalls, the likely problem would be that the tube-type tire's sidewalls are not flexible enough (and the bead not stiff enough), and so, when flexed, might not allow the bead to remain in tight contact with the rim. This could result in seal failures when hitting a bump, etc.
