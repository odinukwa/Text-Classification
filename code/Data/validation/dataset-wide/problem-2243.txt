(In fact Sweden's second tier has a higher average attendance than Norway's Get-ligaen!) So the objective answer appears to lay in the lack of participation (at least at organized levels) in Norway. And that likely also lines up with a lower degree of funding and overall support. Why lowered interest? Seems a part of it may lie in increased interest in alternative sports. Norway has a big history in skiing and even speed skating, one that puts them atop the historic worldwide medal count for the winter Olympics (despite no hockey medals). Additionally, there is a large interest in soccer in Norway, which may be well shared by Sweden, but not as much so in Finland. 

Let's not forget croquet. Here are the rules... looks like all forms use 4 balls (2 per pair). Apparently there also can be 8 separate colored balls when 2 games are being played on one court, called double banker... but unfortunately it appears there's basically not any interaction between the games, as balls are market, and balls deflecting off the balls being used in the other game are replaced. 

You couple the guys who can hit the ball the hardest... and the greatest gatherings of people to within just feet of the fairways and greens, it would seem that crowd members would regularly be hit. Catch someone on the temple or a weak bone, and I'd imagine there could easily be serious injury. Yet I don't remember any big stories about this happening. And the only remotely helpful result from Google seemed to be this Quora discussion. Is this an under-publicized problem? Or an insignificant danger? Or a disaster waiting to happen? 

Denver won. Then withdrew 39 months before the game after voters blocked funding. Then Whistler, near Vancouver, was selected. They turned it down due to a government change. Then the US suggested Salt Lake City as a replacement. SLC withdrew their offer due to economics. Then the US suggested Lake Placid. Finally the IOC opted to put it in Innsbruck, Austria just 36 months before the games. Austria had not bid previously. But that gives a suggestion as to what would happen if everyone withdrew (or if something came up that would prevent hosting): a recent host would end up with the games. They have the infrastructure, they have the experience, and they would need less preparation time. It would seem a straightforward fit. (Innsbruck had held the Winter Games 12 years earlier) Similar has happened in the World Cup, when in 1982 Colombia withdrew from hosting the 1986 World Cup after being the only country to have put in a bid. A new bidding round was requested and three countries made entries; Mexico, which had hosted 16 years prior, was unanimously selected. A more recent extreme example is the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco and South Africa made bids. Morocco won. Then Morocco apparently withdrew just THREE month before the tournament over fears from the Ebola outbreak. 2012 co-hosts Equatorial Guinea took it on, even in a climate where many others refused to consider it. So it would seem likely that there would be some combination of a rebid round or private negotiations, and that it would likely end up moving back to a recent host. And if no one still was interested? Well, the IOC could pay to hold the events themselves, without any direct assistance from the cities. Smaller sporting events do this all the time. Or they could cancel. But doubt we'll come to that any time soon, even with the economic benefits of hosting being uncertain. The Olympics are a huge world event, with plenty of attention and fame. Someone will do it. (You can see the entire history of Olympic bids on Wikipedia) 

I would like to add some more insights to the answer that was already given. Gaining match practice as a reason to enter as a qualifier First, I would like to mention that forgetting to sign in for a tournament on-time is only one reason for top seeds (in the main draw) who play qualifications. There is also another reason: Players sometimes do this on purpose if they want to gain match practice, that is, they want to play as many matches as possible. For example, in 2016 Dennis Novak played 4 Futures (more or less) back to back and in each he played qualifications, despite the fact that he would have been top seed in the main draw. I think the excuse that he didn't sign up in time, is not valid in this case. Here are the draws: 

Entrance as a WC into qualies I would also like to stress, that only in Tunisia F14 Futures, Dennis received a Wild Card into the qualifications. For all three other tournaments he entered as a normal player (without a Wild Card). I am not sure why he needed (?) a Wild Card to play the qualies of Tunisia F14 Futures, because there is also the option to be on-site at the qualifications deadline. In that case (irrespective of your ranking) you can play qualies. After reading the rulebook section regarding entrance into qualifying draws, I am pretty sure that entering via Wild Card is done, when there is the possibility that the Qualifying Draw will be full with regular players. In this case, a top seed player, who wants to play qualificiations, can only play qualifications with a Wild Card. If the player can be 100% sure that the qualifications draw will NOT be full, he does not need a Wild Card and can enter the qualifications draw as a so called On-Site Alternate. Top-Seed plays qualies and main draw is already done Another thing I would like to note is that usually, if a top-seed, who would be (top) seeded in the main draw, plays qualies, the Main Draw is not made until the qualies are finished. The reason for this is, that the top-seeded qualies player will then be also the top seed in the main draw. However sometimes, the Main Draw is already made before the qualifications are finished. In this case, the person, who would have been the top seed in the main draw, if the organizers would have waited until the qualifications are finished, will just be a regular qualifier. There is a valid chance, that this regular qualifier will play a seed in the first round of the tournament (which is stupid, if you ask me). This case will likely happen this week in the Italy F9 Futures (draw), where Stefanos Tsitsipas (ATP #198) is currently playing qualies, but the Main Draw has already been made. Let's see who he will face in the Main Draw (if he successfully qualifies).

The point counts. But it is a fault. Hence, the point is awarded to your opponent. See 13.3.8. However, be award that if the shuttle first hits the head and then the stringed area, it is NOT a fault and therefore a legal shot. 

These are just a few examples to stir the pot, I am sure others will think of more, and also think of some examples who benefited tremendously from changing their arm slot. Consistency in mechanics & delivery is one of, if not the single most, important element in a successful pitcher. That being said, teaching a pitcher to change arm slots constantly can lead to inconsistency and injury. While it may work for some, my conclusion is that it will not work for the majority of pitchers. 

How are lineup cards and official scorebooks recorded on Jackie Robinson Day? Do the managers/scorekeepers use the players' regular numbers, or is it literally "42" for every player's number? 

To answer your question,"Why would you train with a bat that you only use a few months out of the year and you don't use in games?" It comes down to learning the fundamentals. Functionally, a wood bat and aluminum bat serve the same purpose, however, as both you and akadian alluded to, there is a smaller sweet-spot on a wood bat, and you get a lot more "real" feedback, if you will. This trains the batter to work with a smaller margin of error, so when they are swinging their aluminum bat in a game, they are more likely to make good contact, even if they are a little early/late getting to the pitch, because they have trained to be more precise. On an extreme level, many players also use some type of training bat that is much thinner than a normal bat (usually a shortened broom handle) and hit either ping pong balls or whiffle golf balls. It reduces the amount of physical exertion required to get hundreds of swings in per day, and trains an insane amount of hand-eye coordination. Speaking from experience, this exercise helps a LOT. On a completely different note, however, there are also some practical reasons as well. One of these is keeping balls in the ballpark. All the way through high school (and to a lesser extent, college), there were 3-4 of us on my team that would consistently hit balls over the fence numerous times during batting practice. This caused lots of wasted time due to fence hopping and ball finding, and also diminished our supply of baseballs rather quickly. Using a wood bat helps keep a lot of balls in the park that would otherwise go out. The most important thing, however, is MECHANICS MECHANICS MECHANICS!!!!! If you do not maintain good mechanics throughout EVERY single swing you take, you will not get the results you are looking for. So, whether it is hitting with a wood bat, aluminum bat, or a broom handle, the underlying mechanics should never change. Ultimately, I never found switching up what I am hitting, or what I am hitting it with to be an issue when it came to game time. Anyway, that's my $0.02, hope that helps! 

To extend your point, being able to "switch-pitch", that is, pitch with both your right and left arm, would be even more confusing to batters. And be able to throw from multiple arm angles with both arms!! Okay, enough sarcasm. Honestly, the reason is that most pitchers, biomechanically, have an arm slot that works for them to produce velocity, accuracy, and consistency. It is very common for pitchers to get to the major leagues with a certain arm slot, and have success, but for some reason either their pitching coach, or they themselves, will have the brilliant idea to change arm slots to "create more movement" or "hide the ball better", etc. Unfortunately, however, at least from several pitchers I have seen, it has done more harm than good. Some examples of this off the top of my head are: Kevin Jepsen
