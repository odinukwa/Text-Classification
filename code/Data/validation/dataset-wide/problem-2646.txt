Since nobody would dispute the merits of FOL, it comes down to the question in which way adherence to mathematical practice is really a good thing and how the loss of the merits of FOL is evaluated. From my experience with logicians 

Torturing people might be the wrong way to achieve that :) And your "torture chamber with a button" example would make most philosophers itchy, philosophically speaking. (I will restrain myself this time around!) The root of the problem is that philosophy actually started as an activity aimed at questioning basic beliefs of everyday life. This basic attitude and motivation is still passed on in "philosophy's DNA", as it were, up to this day. But there's hope: 

(What does "in time" mean here? According to what time scale?) In any case, the answer is: Yes, according to verificationism such a statement is meaningful. To see this we can look at the writings of A.J. Ayer, who after all propagated the kind of verificationism you refer to. According to Ayer, one must distinguish between "practical verifiability" and "verifiability in principle". And verificationism states that a statement is meaningful if it is verifiable in principle (see Ayer 1952, p. 29). As Ayer explains: 

by which you say that p in A is true, but that you can't fulfill some further condition required to actually know that p (e.g. p is true but lacks justification). No contradiction here. 

Short answer Drawing these kinds of causal connections is, in principle, unproblematic. However, in single cases it is difficult to build good explanations, because it is complicated, if not impossible, to assess their validity. Longer answer As I understand your question, your concern is not really if Plato and Aristotle's further work is built on the prior knowledge they received in their education. Your question is rather if there is an essential determination between the professional background of Plato and Aristotle and their respective theoretical doctrines. This is a question asked in internalist approaches to sociology of knowledge (in this case: sociology of philosophy). 

Bonus-answer ;) Now, if you read the Theaetetus, I'll see that Theaetetus gives partial extensional definitions in response to Socrates question. Socrates in turn tries to delegitimize extensional definitions by implying that they are no definitions at all. Instead, he requests intensional definitions, implying that they are the only (relevant?) type of definitions: 

I'd go with Simon Blackburn's Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy (Cambridge University Press 1999). Here's the blurb: 

As the relevant entry states, thought experiments in philosophy are much older than analytic philosophy and arguably older than modern science itself. So, the latter are instances of thought experiments outside of (preceding) analytic philosophy. And it is very difficult (read: impossible) in those cases to argue that they are "gestures of fellowship towards the experiment in scientific practice" since they are preceding it temporally. We can take at least two routes from here. We may claim that 

The analysis of axiom independence has been a very important search in establishing axiomatic systems and today's axiomatic systems are independent in this sense. 

As your question regards the Theaetetus, I take it that you are interested in primitive notions in (2). The answer to your question 

I'd say it started around the 1950 and got off the ground around 1980 ;) That is to say, the divide as been introduced as a fighting word from the beginning; it is more about asserting the divide than about giving an adequate picture of the philosophical landscape. And it is really not advisable to do proper history of philosophy by using fighting words! Furthemore it becomes a pain (it seems even absurd) to distinguish between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy when studying a development which took place in continental Europe. Nonetheless, we can certainly trace back some distinctive features among different philosophical traditions and schools. I can warmly recommend a wonderful book by Michael Friedman: A Parting of Ways: Carnap, Cassirer, and Heidegger (Open Court Publishing, 2000). 

First, the fields you listed are not all mutually exclusive, so I don't think you would come to a result by ruling something out. Secondly, I think that your claim that "cognitive sciences deal with the exact material processes" is incorrect. Cognitive sciences are not (restricted to) neuroscience. I would submit that cognitive psychology is really the field of research you are looking for. 

Note that we have seen the "far side" of the moon by now, so the question is verifiable in practice. But you can find many other examples in the literature, such as "There are horses on Alpha Centauri". You can read more about verificationism and verifiability in principle here: 

The salient point is that in traditional literary criticism an appeal to the author's intent or experience gives a constraint on possible interpretations and a yardstick to distinguish good and bad interpretations. With the exclusion of the author, this constrains ceases to exist. Now, an attack on the author's role in the interpretation does not necessarily lead to an unconstrained understanding of interpretation. But Barthes' consciously doesn't want to replace the author's authority with some other form of authority and opens up the interpretation game. The multiplicity of meanings has therefore two sources: the many layers of meaning coming from "tradition"; and the plurality of readers (and their understandings) a text is exposed to. Different strains within postmodernism expound on one or the other (or both). Further readings:

Disclaimer: As a philosopher I would strongly discourage such an (ab)use of philosophical terms - it still sounds pretty impressive though ;) 

I interpret the difference in the following way: Williams holds that "to believe that p" equals "to believe that p is true", while Kvanvig holds concedes the weaker view that "to believe that P" implies "to believe that P is true" (under certain premises). I have the following questions: 

I hope to read answers that directly address your concern, namely, continental philosophy. I'd like to give an off-target answer, but which may address your speculation: 

Yes, real science! :) And there's nothing particularly metaphysical about that. The notion of "metaphysical research program" is not directly relevant to the problem you articulate in your question. (Feel free to ask another question if you want to know more about it.) Falsificationism and the problem of competing hypotheses Going into the specifics of your question, you write that in your field it is 

On the other hand, this kind of context-sensitivity gets in the way of studying common patterns across different domains, i.e. an effort at theoretical generalization, which you seem to be interested in. Countering this case-study trend, some parts of informal logic aim to construct a comprehensive account of these different types of argumentation. Historically, these attempts have mostly been made in a field called argumentation theory, a field drawing from logic and linguistics, which intersects with informal logic. 2. The practice of reasoning in practice Your second goal, namely to "improve the [your?] practice of reasoning" is addressed by another major domain of informal logic called "critical thinking", another intersection where the tools of informal logic are applied with an inclusive educational goal in mind, not just limited to academe. You might have come across discussions about e.g. atheism referring to informal fallacies. This is a good example of notions pertaining to early phase of the field of informal reasoning, where a theory of fallacy was predominant, that slowly trickled down from the ivory towers of academe into pop culture and can be found today in every other Reddit thread. (This SE gets its own share by hosting many questions about fallacies by people otherwise not interested in philosophy.) Conclusion So, to answer your question: Informal logic is definitely the keyword you're looking for. The bad news is that the field is not systematized and so there is no simple "Introduction to informal logic" covering all aspects you might be looking for. The moral of the story here: Don't give up just because you don't find something fitting on your first try. 

which is, obviously, a contradiction. (Or, there are two different meaning of "knowing" involved.) 2) If we assume that it is "I assert that p", then your conjunctive statement is stating that 

The dictionary definition of implies the lack of certain features; e.g. in a cultural setting that might be the lack of a sophistication/development in areas of culture, economy or technology. Conversely, the antonym of is . A modern cultural setting implies that it has those features that primitive cultures lack. The iterative list names a lot of social phenomenons/habits with negative connotations, particularly from a progressivist world view. The features of the child in the image (painted face, indian lineaments, green background) are used to suggest that (s)he is part of a population usually stereotyped as being primitive. The child picture works as a pictorial pars pro toto. The apposition between the items listed and the child, formally reinforced by the dictionary definition in (1), suggests that the listed lack of social phenomenons/habits applies to the primitive population which the child represents. The point being made is that the lack of certain features -- negative features according to definition (1) -- is actually a good thing from a progressivist point of view. The punchline refers to the implicit inversion of (1) and (2), where the lack of certain negative social phenomenons/habits is what is actually sought by progressivism in modern societies and is already attained in primitive ones.
