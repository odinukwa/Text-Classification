I don't think you can produce the food in a city. It will need to be surrounded by a lot of farmland (also solar farms and wind farms) But the back-story may be the almost complete ecological collapse of the late 21st century leading to the death of most of the human race. ( I hope not but we aren't listening well to the warnings). Somewhere got lucky and the climate changes that wrecked most of the planet created an improvement locally. Geographically, Australia would work well, although I know it would take a lot more than rain to make the red interior into best fertile farmland. Or maybe the US centre after 200 ft of sea level rise turns the Missisippi into a new Mediterranean Sea and makes US central winters balmy. Anyway, the survivors somehow pull together in a mega-city in the middle of a continent-sized patch of arable land, and vow to control their population and let the planet heal itself. They hold to this with religious fervour, and nature rewards them. 1000 years on there is one city of 600 million people. Farming is completely automated. Everyone is vegetarian (or maybe meat on very special occasions omly). They worship Gaia. Nobody lives permanently amongst the robo-tractors and -trucks, though engineers visit when maintenance is needed. The rest of the planet is uninhabited and regarded as sacred ground. (Not sure why no survivors elsewhere. Plague? Nuclear pogroms during the dark century? Beserker bots? An in-gathering when population overshoot becomes undershoot - we need everybody and we can offer you a better life?) All of these? Anyway, it is a technological and technocratic utopia but people are forgetting their past. Now, rewrite the Atlantis.myth in that setting? 

We actually have a historical precedent, though at an earlier tech level, in our world: China. The Chinese were the first great explorers. They had (for the time) huge ocean-going sailing ships. They had sailed around India and Africa and possibly as far as Europe. They had probably discovered North America. They were on the verge of creating a British Empire centuries before the British did. And then .... A dynasty came to an end. The new emperor was insecure. His administration felt threatened by the new and the foreign. So the country turned inwards and backwards. The fleet was burned. It became a capital crime to sail outside coastal waters. Trade outside China's land Borders was heavily discouraged. New inventions likewise, if not actually banned. Traditional ways were encouraged. It "worked'. Social stability was re-attained, but at a price. China ceased to develop while the "barbarians" in Europe first caught up and then surpassed China. When they in turn started exploring, China was effectively defenceless against fleets that they could no longer match and highly developed versions of the canons that China invented first! So in answer to the question: yes, in the medium term. But in the long term a society that cuts itself off and turns inward will at best stagnate, while the rest of the world advances. 

If the users are non-human, a GUI interface may present serious issues. Maybe they have compound eyes, like insects, and any sort of pixel-grid display creates serious moire fringing effects between the screen and their eyes. Or maybe they see in sonar, like bats or dolphins. How do you make a sonar screen? If they are (almost?) human, maybe their society is a strict meritocracy (with fascistic overtones). You are not allowed to access a computer until you prove that you are intelligent enough to use one in an intelligent manner. In other words, program one. By the time you are a half-decent prgrammer, you will probably prefer a command-line interface over a GUI interface for most tasks in any case. (If you are any sort of geek, you'll have heard the jokes about lusers and drool-proof keyboards. In this world, the geeks are the rulers). 

He'd presumably know about Jenner's original vaccine and the historical methods leading up to it, so he could reproduce that. Basically Jenner observed that milkmaids who had caught cowpox,hardly ever caught smallpox and almost always survived even if they did. So he innoculated people with pus from cowpox sores (yuk!), which provided them with protection against smallpox. (Sometimes it caused them to develop full-blown cowpox, but that's a minor illness compared to the highly lethal and always disfiguring smallpox, so it was a risk worth taking). More generally, don't forget how primitive was medical knowledge at the time. A vaccine or drug that caused serious damage or even death to 1% of the people who used it, would be seen as well worth the risk if the alternative was known to be a 10% or greater chance of dying horribly from the disease it prevented. (Or would be so seen, once it was proved. Jenner faced much opposition to begin with. ) Even in the 20th century, treatment of Syphilis with horribly poisonous Mercury- and Arsenic-based drugs was preferable to suffering from and dying of tertiary syphilis. A safe alternative simply did not exist. 

Short answer to the question: no. Some excellent long answers already posted. One additional reason in practice rather than abstract is this. How do you keep the test questions secret? And how can you convince the electorate that the answers were not leaked to a select group to bias the result? I think it's a given that even if complete secrecy was indeed maintainted, somebody will claim otherwise! A better idea is to make voting slightly harder. I was opposed to the wider introduction of postal voting. Much better if voters are required to make themselves physically present at a polling station, or to apply in advance of each election giving reasons why physical presence is an unreasonable imposition. Historically medical infirmity attested by a doctor and pre-planned travel attested by an employer or hotel or transport bookings were accepted. If you did not vote that was regarded as precisely equivalent to "don't care" and willingness to abide by whatever result was obtained from the folks who did care. Some people live nearer to polling stations than others so maybe increase the time penalty slightly. Quirky, but if the system was such that you had to sit in the polling station for five minutes in silence with all electronic devices turned off before you could cast your vote, that would be an improvement. Also those five minutes might encourage reconsideration and responsible voting. I have done jury service. I hope that all juries are like the ones I was on and take plenty of time to consider before irrevocably deciding . The democratic voting system could enforce a pause for consideration and this could not be argued as a disguised attempt at gerrymandering. BTW I suspect I am in a smallish minority in this Twitter-obsessed world of instant gratification and knee - jerk reactions. So be it.
