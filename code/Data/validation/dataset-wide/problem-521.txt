If you're commuting on a race bike or full suspension mountain bike something, you may not have the brake clearance or mounting points to run something like these fenders (they're some set made by Planet Bike, but a lot of manufacturers make similar ones). In this case, you can get something that mounts solely on the down tube on and on the seatpost: which will go a long way to keeping you dry (but not as much as full fenders). 

That's just a mountain Shimano triple flat bar shifter with a V-brake lever. You can buy any left hand shifter which is marked for triples from the Shimano mountain lines: Tourney, Alivio, Acera, Altus, Deore. You may need a separate brake lever, which has to be sold for V-brakes and flat bars (it will look like the existing brake lever). Microshift also makes compatible ones, as does SRAM under their Attack! line. You can also use a friction shifter (cheapest option, eg. Sunrace SLM10). As an example, you can use the Shimano Acera SL-M310 shifter combined with the Shimano Acera BL-M421 brake lever. 

It looks like it runs a 3x7 Shimano mountain drivetrain. You can get new shifters such as the Shimano ST-EF51's (the 3x7 version; which are switchable between V-brakes and cantilevers -- see manual for details) or the SL-M310 (in the 7 speed version for the rear, triple for the front; add your own brake levers if yours are integrated with the appropriate cable pull). I'd probably opt for the SL-M310's personally -- I've had the ST-EF51's briefly and the quality left something to be desired. Alternatively, you can buy the Microshift DS85-7 (grip shifts) or TS38-7 (trigger shifters) and add your own brakes. Or SRAM Attack! grip shifts. If you're really cheap, just buy a set of thumb friction shifters. Any ones will do. These aren't indexed so you have to move them into the right position to shift based on feel. I'd also suggest replacing the cables while you're at it. 

Your bicycle is probably as protected as its going to get when it comes out of the factory, so I'd suggest doing nothing (well, maybe crash less). 

If you want to go 9 speed, you'll need a Shimano-compatible 9 speed shifter for the rear (i.e. the right shifter). You'll also want a 9 speed chain. Your hub should be fine for the cassette swap. And the 9 speed cassette, of course. In terms of how much faster you should go, possibly none. You really need to keep up a good cadence most likely and you'd be better off switching to a different 8 speed cassette than investing in a 9 speed system. And that would cost way less (you may need to add a few links to your chain, so you may need a new chain, but 8 speed chains are significantly cheaper than 9 speed). 

These are just old U-Brakes (installed at the chain stays as was cool for part of the late 80s). You just need to unbolt them from the studs (maybe hit it with some penetrating oil to help loosen it oFF the studs). Unfortunately due to the placement of the U brake , you're going to need to get another u brake since you won't be able to mount a normal brake that way. 

The general answer is "it depends". Certainly, weight reductions help increasing speed, but improving the rider's strength and good bike fitting will go much further for improving performance than tire faffery. (Obviously, for professional racers, this advice doesn't apply - cutting grams and everything is part of what they need to do to win). Wider tires should be run at lower pressures than narrower tires. It is true that rolling resistance drops with pressure increases and for similar tires of different widths at the same pressure the wider will have lower rolling resistance (but this is moot by the prior sentence). Note the word "similar" - a knobby tire of the same width will have higher rolling resistance than a slick. Wider tires can better absorb bumps and what not, so they can increase control giving net better performance in the real world. However, as you see on many road race bikes designed for purely nice pavement, thin tires are normally spec'd. As for aerodynamic drag, the paper "Aerodynamic Characteristics of Low-Drag Bicycle Wheels", Aeronautical J., Vol. 99, No. 983, Mar. 1995, pp.109-120 (summarized here) says ~10-15% of the drag is due to wheels, and by switching wheels you can get net 2-3% improvement. This is tiny, especially when you look at how much fancy aerodynamic wheels cost (and their low durability). For someone who is not racing, its almost surely better to put the money you might spend on a fancy aero wheel into having a durable wheel. Now, to the reality of the situation: A wider tire is going to give you better ride quality and you can get very good rolling resistance by picking a smooth tire for road use. You have to balance durability of the tire and the wheel if you choose to do improvements here. For most people who are not in race situations, pick a decently wide tire, play with the tire pressures so you get a good ride and low rolling resistance and move on with your life. In theory, depending on the terrain, you might be able to go faster with a narrower higher pressure tire, but the possible ride and control effects may hurt you in net. 

18 mile trips are reasonably short, and 2200 miles a year isn't much. General advice: You want to replace things as they break/get worn down. For example, if your chain is worn or cassette is worn, you'll want to replace it (though you should get several thousand miles out of each, but YMMV with riding conditions, maintenance, etc.), when the chain is properly lubricated. Make sure to do the 1 month service after you buy the bike (this should have been included with your purchase), since they'll have to adjust things (cable stretch, etc.). You can find most of the things you need to do for bike maintenance on Sheldon Brown's site, and you can look at books like "The Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance & Repair" by Todd Downs, which goes over several common problems and solutions and adjustments. Things you will probably have to adjust within the first year are the brakes as the pads wear down (rate is highly depending on riding conditions), chain cleaning / lubrication (and possibly a new chain at the end of the year), and fine derailleur adjustments due to cable stretch. You'll probably also have to clean the rims at some point due to residue from the brake pads. And you'll probably want to tighten nuts and bolts periodically, since they do come loose eventually. And you obviously need to keep your tires inflated properly (and possibly repair any punctures). Bike Fit: The only things you want to replace off the bat are things related to bike fit (these would have come up if you had a professional bike fitting done). For example, if the stem is too long, you'd have swapped it out for a shorter one, or if the saddle is too narrow, you'd have put in a wider one. But, if you're properly adjusted to this, then you don't really need to replace things (but there is a great deal of personal preference to bike fitting - it isn't a science). One thing to note is that a wide cushy saddle isn't really good for anything longer than 5-10 mile rides for most people, so if you're not used to using your sit bones, a good saddle may not feel good at first. Some accessories you may want: You may also want to go with some grips with bar ends like the Ergon GP3 which give you another hand position or so, for longer rides (you won't really need them for ~25 mile rides, but I do like them a lot, even for my commute). Even if you're not intending to ride at night, you should have some lights (cause you will get caught at night one day). You should also buy a helmet and a good u-lock. If you're commuting on this, you may want to get some full fenders - they'll keep crud out of the drive train and dirt off your back. A bike multitool is nice for rides as well, in case something goes wrong. A bike rack is also sometimes useful. You should also be familiar with basic bike maintenance (like, how to change a tire, patch a flat, etc.).
