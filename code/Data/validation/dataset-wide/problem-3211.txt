It is for me hard to imagine that major events, like the end of a war, etc. could only be transmitted at the speed of a ship across of the Atlantic although we frequently read this. However, a combination of, for example, carrier pigeons and semaphores might serve to speed the results of a "binary" event. Is there any evidence of at least realistic attempts to transmit information across oceans faster than ships moved? EDIT: I would add that ships might be involved in the semaphore process although I was thinking land-based semaphore stations. Multiple stationary ships, although it would take probably hundreds, might work. Such a scheme was proposed for navigation but afaik not implemented. By allowing ships to move in a narrow range, the number of ships could be reduced. A truly expensive approach, I realize. 

That stress, specifically the hormones released in response to stress, actually kills neurons I think was first demonstrated by Sapolsky within the past 30 years or so. Needless to say, before the 20th century when even insulin and various vitamins were not understood, such hormones were far beyond the understanding of medical science and even today many see psychosomatic illness as "imaginary" -- Just snap out of it, soldier! Also, higher death rates in the past due to inferior medical treatment limited the sample size and perhaps something about the continuous bombardments that modern technology allowed induced PTSD at rates not seen in previous wars. 

This was a variation of the F.N. model. 1910 that was commissioned by the Yugoslavian military in the inter-war period with 60,000 ordered with both general issue and "officer" markings. Note, the Wikipedia article is horribly referenced, but you should be able to confirm this in Anthony Vanderlinden's book FN Browning Pistols: Side-Arms That Shaped World History as several other sites refer to it (I don't have a copy so can't verify this). 

Escape attempts at Elmira seemed to be fairly common from what I find. One account describes the punishment for prisoners caught in escape attempts, and implies that tunneling was a common way to wind up there. 

To further complicate matters, archaeology isn't the only tool for tracking population movements. Bellwood offers linguistic changes in the region as another piece of evidence that supports incredibly rapid movement. 

The Lexington had been taken prize by the British on September 19th, and was put up for repairs in Dover shortly before the loss of Reprisal, as noted in The Public Advertiser (London), 3 October 17772: 

I just wondered if the equivalent of nazis researching baptismal records, etc. occurred in the USA with Chinese Americans being forced to find proof of their national origin or face being interned; indeed, are there any incidents of Chinese Americans actually being interned? I would guess there were very few, I mean literally only hundreds, of mixed-race children in the USA at that time, but how were such children treated? Were there any laws analogous to the nazi Nuremberg laws applied -- for example, Jews who actually practiced Judaism fared worse than Jews who were merely "racially" Jews -- did Japanese Americans who actually spoke Japanese have more problems than more assimilated Japanese Americans? 

The laws applied to not only Blacks but also Asians. At one time I think Chinese in the USA could not effectively marry at all due to immigration policy. Jews could legally be discriminated against in housing and employment. Hotels also did openly discriminate against Jews. But as far as I know, there were no laws that prevented intermarriage. Is this correct? 

Whether it was 2 years or 200 years, the academic consensus was that it was incredibly fast. I would likely lean more toward the longer time-frame, as the archaeological record is more consistent with a "slower" migration. Stuart Fiedel gives the mainstream account of a migration that took around 100-150 years. 

A couple modern authors note that his politics were a strain on his career, such as this passage from Fighting Elites: A History of U.S. Special Forces by John C. Fredriksen (p101): 

However, the preponderance of materials I could find gave his age at 15. Note that this is the youngest that I can find substantiating record of. The database at deathpenaltyusa.org lists an unnamed white male executed for arson in Suffolk County, Massachusetts in 1837 at the age of 13, but I can't find any source material that would corroborate that. EDIT: In response to the edited question, the youngest person (and certainly the youngest female) generally believed to have been legally executed in the United States is Hannah Ocuish, executed at age 12 in Connecticut in 1786. Note that the deathpenaltyusa.org site linked about records 2 other 12 year olds executed, both black slaves, a boy in Virginia by the name of Clem on 5/11/1787 and another boy named Bill on 7/30/1791. In the latter case, there seems to be a disagreement on the location. I'm guessing that the LA Times is the more accurate account.3 1 Radelet, Michael ed. Facing the Death Penalty: Essays on a Cruel and Unusual Punishment, p 52 2 Morning Examiner. (Bartlesville, Okla.), Vol. 15, No. 46, Ed. 1 Saturday, April 9, 1910, p 3 3 Los Angeles Times.

I am wondering whether most dogfights ended decisively and if so, whether many relatively inexperienced pilots knew they were probably going to die or at least have to eject from their planes. Or was it possible for even a new fighter pilot to at least have a chance of running away rather than engaging either a better pilot or a numerically superior group of planes? 

To somewhat echo other answers: The advantage of not having to win was considered very significant, as it usually is but I guess it was not enough in this case. Also, the South thought that the production of cotton would be somehow a very important factor but this was wrong (although not completely so since indeed cotton was one of the few things that the South had going for it) since other parts of the World also produced cotton. But the question of belief is somewhat subjective and I will give an opinion: I don't think the Southern leadership was particularly sophisticated. Late in the war, they seemed to think, even though they were certainly ambivalent about it, that arming the slaves would help them when there was every reason to believe this would not work at all. Jeff Davis was a good soldier but I think he was in over his head in his position and his sole competent advisor as far as I can tell was Judah P. Benjamin who himself frankly might have been in over his head. 

He eventually arrived in Le Harve on June 20th, after brief layovers in Santander and La Coruña in Spain and Plymouth, England. The picture below purports to be of the Ypiranga entering the Le Harve harbor with Díaz aboard. 

Reprisal indeed sank in a storm, but there seems to be some dispute as to whether it was on October 1st or November 1st. This is one of the surviving contemporary reports from an "Extract of a letter from the gentleman of this place, dated at Bourdeaux, November 20, 1777".1 

The last section is typical of the attitude of the Romans (and very similar to colonizing powers throughout history), as it portrays Rome itself as the source of civilization. Simply put, the closer to the influence of Roman culture, the more civilized the population. By further comparison to the comparative cultural merits of the Gauls and Germans, he notes in chapter 31 (my emphasis): 

...it seems like this has been repeated in quite a few other secondary sources in a context of advocating genocide. I'll defer judgment of whether this was taken out of context to the reader. 

I recall reading that the Spanish tended to aim for sails or masts which was considered less effective than aims at the body of the ship but I guess also allowed the ships to be taken with less damage. So if true, was this the reason? More puzzling and I am guessing a myth or misunderstanding is that Chinese aim over the heads of the enemy because their "spirit" was located there. Could this be true? 

I am not saying it is the only thing but the difficulty of becoming literate may have prevented the development of more than one potential Chinese innovator who was born into a family that could not afford education. I think of Faraday who had humble beginnings and he was not the only one. Importantly, who knows what would happened to Western science without Faraday? It is possible that another person motivated and capable of making his discoveries might not have come along for a generation. If not Faraday, I am sure there are other examples of people who benefited from being born in the West. 

Much of the work he did on The History of Liberty has been published in various essays and collections, but his opus was never completed. 1 Boyd, Kelly. Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, Volume 1, p. 1 2 Smith, George H. Lord Acton and the History of Liberty, Part 1, online 

I would suggest reading Book 1 of The Gallic Wars (link has both English and Latin if you want to see the untranslated text), which is as much a political history of the conquest of Gaul as it is a military history. Julius Caesar starts the book with a description of the political landscape at the time: 

According to the Wikipedia article on Trinity, the estimated yield of the device was between 18 and 20 kilotons from a 6.2 kg plutonium 239 core. Complete fission of Pu-239 yields 19 kilotons per kilogram, giving an efficiency of somewhere between 15% and 17%. 

The ship was the SS Ypiranga, which was indeed a German ship (although it was at that point a cargo-steamer, not yet a passenger liner). Díaz departed from the port of Veracruz on May 31st, 1911 bound for the French port of Le Havre with a stop Havana. The event was reported in the June 1st edition of the New York Times: 

Obviously, Hiroshima was the first and except for the witnesses to the test less than 2 months before and some top military and politicians, it was a complete shock. On the other hand, that the second bomb was used probably was also shocking in it own way. 

In the book by Evans about Judah P. Benjamin, we see that some in the southern leadership in fact thought that arming the slaves was a possibility. This indicates that it was indeed plausible to some that slaves actually would fight not against the Confederacy but for it. Naturally, this was a very, very controversial initiative which met with opposition for many reasons, not the least of which was of course fear of arming slaves. It was also argued that if Blacks could make good soldiers then the idea that they were only fit for slavery was false. 

In at least some camps, inmates were encouraged to write, although certainly heavily censored, postcards/letters to family to allay suspicions of both families and international agencies like The Red Cross. Part of the motive also may have been so money and food was sent to inmates which were probably stolen. 

This may be referring to The Magyar Struggle, from Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 194, January 13, 1849 (emphasis mine): 

More specifically, a couple of passages from the book American Commando: Evans Carlson, His WWII Marine Raiders, and America's First Special Forces Mission by John F. Wukovits speak to the hesitation of the Marines to even allow him to re-enlist (p17): 

Image from $URL$ The photo paper stamp would put the ship in theater during Vietnam, where it both ran supplies and assisted in supporting the "Brown Water navy" operating in the Mekong Delta. That would date the photo sometime between 1966 and 1969 (probably later based on the stamps on the back of the print). You can find some additional information about the ship's service history at the Mobile Riverine Force Association website. 

Religion as a motivation for Armstrong's solo visit is very unlikely. Armstrong was actually the 2nd U.S. Astronaut that travelled to the Soviet Union - the first was Frank Borman, who arrived in Moscow on July 2nd, 1969 after being invited by the U.S.S.R. Institute for Soviet-American Relations.1 Borman was among the more religious of the Apollo astronauts, and the Soviets certainly can't have missed his reading of Genesis when Apollo 8 was orbiting the Moon on December 24, 1968. Like Borman, Armstrong was not invited by the Soviet government - his visit was arranged through the International Council of Scientific Unions' Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Armstrong was part of a delegation of 32 American scientists and NASA officials2 and was ostensibly there to present a paper titled "Lunar Surface Exploration" at the 13th COSPAR conference in Leningrad May 20th through May 29th, 1970 (which he also subsequently presented at a conference in Berlin the next year).3 The official Soviet government response to his visit was a luke-warm, and it took 5 days after his arrival to get permission to visit the Kremlin.4 Most likely, Armstrong's visit was a natural result of the attempts of the heads of both the U.S. and Soviet scientific communities to develop a more cooperative relationship than had characterized the early space race. Several months prior to Armstrong's trip to Leningrad, Thomas O. Paine (Administer of NASA at the time) had sent his counterpart at the Soviet Academy of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh a copy of two reports on the possibility of creating a more cooperative relationship between the two agencies.
