This observation by Korzenewsky is very similar in circumstances to the reported sighting from Shanghai, so I would not rule it out completely without further investigation of the meteorological conditions that day. It was late summer, with clear calm conditions (breeze < 5 mph at ground zero), which is typical of mirage conditions. This link goes into the detailed meteorological conditions necessary for a long-distance superior mirage, such as the reported observation must have been. The required temperature inversion could easily have existed in late morning in early August over the cooler waters of the Sea of Japan. Update: Sweeney can accurately say that "the underside of the great clouds over Nagasaki" were at least 6 miles high, because he himself was at 30,000 feet for the bombing run and aftermath. 

re At least half of that (five days' worth) is in the form of grain edible by humans. This is incorrect - Horses cannot safely eat grain unless it is mixed with high-cellulose forage which is completely inedible to humans. 

By March 1496 even the English had located and employed their own adventurers to explore the New World, namely John Cabot and Sons, by granting Letters Patent in exchange for a 20% Royal interest in profits: 

Proper Squad Sizing is important for minimizing loss of trim when the unit wheels. By having the shorter men in the middle take a normal pace in a wheel, the taller men on the outside can more easily stretch their pace to keep the line trimmed. Those on the inside must shorten their pace, but ease of doing that is not dependent on leg length. The Canadian Forces Drill Manual illustrates this process on page 2-28, from a single rank in which the tallest individuals have formed to the right and the shortest to the left: 

Beer is made by fermenting a malt (or mashed grain) such as barley. The process of malting begins identically as that of preparing sprouts for food, except it is then halted by drying. Since beer-making in this way has been known to European and Middle Eastern cultures for thousands of years, then the process of sprouting was also known to those same cultures. 

It is readily apparent that it contains vast territories favouring camels over horses (mostly Arabia, Egypt, and Libya) as well as those that favour horses over camels (basically everything north of and including Anatolia) and territories with little bias (Greater Syria and Mesopotamia). When planning a campaign, once all the troops ideal for the campaign conditions have been identified an assessment must be made as to whether that force is sufficient. If not, then additional troops must be identified that are (as little as possible) less than ideal. Note that it is a non-trivial problem to convert camel-drawn transport and -mounted troops to use of horses. The tack is very different, and horses would typically be 4 or 5 years old before being suitable for an arduous campaign. But even before the campaign horses themselves are obtained, sufficient breeding mares must be obtained. For an army the size of the Great Sultan's perhaps three or four generations of breeding would be necessary to raise the requisite number of horses. This is not the work of a season, a year, or even a couple of years. Planning to convert massive numbers of camel-drawn and -mounted units would take a decade or even two. And after the campaign, all those units would have to be converted back to camel transport. At some point, an assessment of the conversion's worth must be made - perhaps it is better to accept the lesser effectiveness of the camel-drawn and -mounted troops, and simply take a few more of them. 

This custom developed because it was always the custom of the British House of Commons, from which most legislative traditions of the United States ultimately derive. This custom also serves a functional purpose in the assembly: to maintain an illusion of (at least partial) impartiality on the part of the Speaker, as a means of enhancing his authority on thorny issues; by only voting, and thus revealing his mind, when such is absolutely necessary. 

and from even 1840 where the proposed analysis might be held to be even stronger. but simply is not born out: 

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945 the following declaration was included in the conference proceedings in regards to Poland's Eastern border: 

It seems to have been very simple: Classes of newly graduating pilots were asked to volunteer, and the entire class would volunteer enthusiastically by doing so with both hands. The attitude of Japanese society can be judged from the fact that, even fifty years after the war, kamikaze pilots who simply failed to find a target were still being shunned. Some veteran pilots were allowed to demur, as with Tetsuzō Iwamoto who stated his belief that fighter pilots should be tasked with shooting down enemy fighters and was allowed to train Kamikaze pilots instead. This may all sound flippant, but that is not my intent. There seems to have been no need for any explicit coercion, because the implicit coercion, from peers and society, was far more than sufficient. There was no greater dishonour than to refuse a request from the emperor's appointed representatives to die for Japan. 

Note from this that there was apparently no opposition to the title King Consort being used, only to it being held by a foreigner. 

It is foolish to apply literally the maxims applicable to a mostly-levy army 2500 years ago to more modern forces. There is much of value to be found in The Art of War, as well as much that has faded from applicability over the centuries; one must read with understanding to distinguish one from the other. Caesar, only 400 or so years subsequent to Sun Tzu, routinely force-marched his veteran legions during the campaigns in Gaul to great effect. The massively efficient organization that was a Roman Legion on campaign, financed by the tributes and looting of an Empire, rarely had difficulty keeping Caesar's legions supplied during these maneuvers, which left the Gauls constantly wondering when and where Caesar's forces would appear next. This ability to surprise the Gauls, and apply superior force consecutively to a series of Gallic forces, were at the core of Caesar's success. Note that several of Caesar's Gallic campaigns were initiated in spring and even winter, when his troops would not have to force march through the heat of a summer afternoon. Frederick likewise applied the same tactics 1700 years later, again to great effect. Force marching onto the supply lines of one's opponent was the only means (other than relieving a siege) of forcing battle in that era of massive supply trains and linear tactics, and Frederick used this to pick and choose the location and timing of his battles carefully. In April 1809 Oudinot force-marched his entire 2nd Corps of (mostly) new recruits for 5 days to play a key role in the destruction of Charles's left wing under Hiller. Note that Davout had been stockpiling foodstuffs and other supplies around central Bavaria for 4-6 weeks before Charles invaded, so outrunning supplies was not an issue for Oudinot. Although Oudinot sustained greater then usual attrition from this march, it was more like 10% over the five days than 30. See the excellent descriptions of the early 1809 Campaign in Saski: Campagne de 1809 en Allegmagne et en Autriche and in Jack Gill: Thunder on the Danube Volume 1. During the era of Marlborough, Frederick, and Naploleon, the normal daily routine of an army on campaign was to:
