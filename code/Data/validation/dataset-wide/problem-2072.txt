In the baldest of terms, you have two choices: start doing as your boss asks, and let the chips fall where they may, or tell your boss why you don't delegate. A combination of the two is probably wise. Refusing to do something because you don't think you can is kind of a career limiting move. Next time you have a delegable task, go to your boss and say something like this: 

I have hired interns, and my own children have been interns. So please don't read malice or lack of empathy into what I am going to tell you: You deserve nothing. You cannot claim that after several months (Which is not really very long) at a company, you deserve to be told about something that went wrong and got corrected. The company existed before you joined and will continue to exist afterwards. Things have gone wrong everywhere, and been corrected, and we kind of all take it on faith that corrections have been enough. If (and you say this is not the case) you were nervous you might be in danger, you could ask someone to reassure you. However that need for reassurance would not necessarily have to include being told all the details of what happened and what steps were taken to prevent them happening again. You are unlikely to be able to evaluate whether those steps are sufficient. And anyway, you don't feel in danger. You're just curious. There's nothing wrong with being curious, but it doesn't magically put you in a position to demand anything from anyone. Please keep in mind that a person died. You are asking these people to satisfy your personal curiosity about the death of their coworker. The death they may feel partly responsible for. Can you imagine what discussing that is like for them? How it might hurt them to bring that up? And you think perhaps there is some slight professional benefit you might gain from having them go through it with you. It's really very selfish for you to ask them to go through that for your slight chance of a professional benefit. Your instincts that asking about this would stir up emotions are right. But perhaps you can ask indirectly. For example, you can ask if the company has done "lessons learned" exercises on your product in the past. You can even say "I have never had a chance to read one of those documents, would it be ok if I read that one?" when someone tells you there is one. Wanting to learn is good. "Tell me more about the time your friend and coworker died at work and what you decided to do after that" is tactless and possibly a career-limiting move. 

I had a client once with the same name as the (then) Prime Minister. He used a headshot of the PM as his avatar. Everyone knew why. Everyone knew it wasn't really him. Both are important. When you use Papa Smurf or Superman, people don't know why you chose that. My avatar, as you can see, isn't a picture of anyone. I use it here, on Twitter, and a bunch of other places too. Where did it come from? A blog entry of mine over 10 years ago. 

Some people interpret the second kind as information-free, since some workplaces forbid any other kind of reference. They may be construed as neutral in that sense - they neither add nor subtract anything. Other people interpret the second kind as negative - I am forbidden to tell you the truth about how bad this person was so I will just give you facts. The minute you start listing the specific skills the person had, or anything beyond name and job title, you have left the realm of the second letter and would be in the first, except you are not gushing about how amazing the person is so you must be secretly trying to convey that they are terrible. No amount of effort on your part will change this, other than transforming the letter into a paean to their perfection, which you probably don't want to do. Write the second kind of letter. Offer to be a reference for the person, someone whose phone number and email is supplied "on request" - and in that less formal environment, answer questions the potential new employer asks. Don't try to write a letter that hits "just the right tone" - such a tone doesn't exist when it comes to references, and even if it did, each reader interprets a given letter differently. 

Perhaps snacks that are out of the normal routine could do the trick? Every once in a while you show up with something people don't normally eat - maybe something sweet and unhealthy (Krispy Kremes, home-made butter tarts, your sister's famous lemon squares) or maybe something healthier than normal programmer fare (a bowl of Honeycrisp apples during their short season, cut up raw veggies, mini sandwiches) - and everyone stops what they're doing for a moment because hey, there's cool food here. You gather around the food and talk about who made it, or who found it if it was bought, and what you like about it, and perhaps some other small talk happens too. If the company as a whole wants this to happen, seems like a small budget to allow you guys to take turns buying/making stuff, along with a loose schedule for whose turn it is which week, could be pretty easy to arrange. 

I would stand up in that situation. If you are simply speaking to each other, stand and face him, and continue the conversation. If you need to work on a computer screen, for a short period of time you can do so standing up. But my guess is you're not working on a computer screen or you would just be able to stare at that and not have to deal with his body language. If he reacts oddly when you stand, you could perhaps "cover" by offering him your chair, or by perching on the edge of your desk so that you're still sort of sitting. But staying in your chair while he manspreads at you is making you feel awkward, and rightly so. Stop putting up with it. If talking out loud about his nonverbal behaviours upsets him (either because he's not really aware that he's doing them, or why, or because he doesn't like his deliberate activities not working) then fine, don't talk about them. But that doesn't mean you have to sit at your desk while someone looms over you and puts you uncomfortably close to their crotch. 

The important part of the answer to almost any interview question is the "why" part. Say you loved your job at company A. I ask you "tell me about your job at company A? Did you like it?" and you say 

It makes perfect sense to me that the manager appeared not to be interested after you proved the lie was a lie. Once you have proven you are doing your job, your manager no longer has something to fix about you. Your manager may now want to deal with the liar, or may not. Telling you "oh, I'm going to go fire that person for lying" or "if that person lies one more time I will fire them" is highly inappropriate, so it's not surprising the manager appears to drop the subject. Your part in it is over. Did the manager really take the lies at face value? The manager came to you and when you explained you were doing that task, said "ok fine then." That doesn't sound like the liar was unilaterally believed. Once you take yourself into "I do not know who else in the office he has lied to about me" territory you're torturing yourself for no reason. Do your job. Do it well, do all of it. Don't be a gossiper, a liar, or a meta talker. Nobody is going to be surprised to learn you didn't like being lied about. There's no need to tell your coworker that. They tried lying about you and it didn't work. The best revenge, as they say, is living well. 

Once you have the job, if something arises where it's clear you need an accommodation (headphone-wearing, office-furniture-changing, or whatever) try simply asking for it because you need it to work well. If that request is declined, then you can mention that it's your first guess that this is actually a needed accommodation. That may require doctor letters or whatever, so if you don't need to demand and prove things, why bother? And finally, when all is going swimmingly at your job and you're excelling, consider mentioning invisible differences or things people have never heard of, simply to change the mindset of your coworkers. I think we've all heard Joe Blowhard saying that X people can't do this job, not like we Y people, when in fact one of us is an X person. I have heard speeches about immigrants from those who assumed I wasn't one. Friends have heard speeches about gay people or very religious people. And you will probably hear speeches about disabled people. By being "out" as your whole self, when you're in a good safe place, you raise the opinion of the general populace about whether or not disabled people can do this job. You increase the chances of someone ten years from now on a hiring panel saying "what do you mean, don't hire the X applicant? I worked with a person who had X years ago and that was one of the best developers I ever met. There's no reason X keeps you from doing this job." 

The short term solution is "references available on request" on the resume. Never let people just randomly contact your references with your knowledge and without your ability to provide context. The effort to contact a candidate, ask for their reference info, then contact 3 or 4 references and ask sensible questions and take notes can easily exceed an hour or two. In that amount of time I could interview you. So if you seem like a good candidate, I'll probably interview you and then ask for your references if you make it to the "good" pile after the interview. I think I'm pretty representative in this. Recruiters are often rabid about demanding references early and often; this seems to be primarily driven by their desire to use that contact info to find leads more than to vet you. So, you're in the interview, everything is going great, and the interviewer says "oh, I will need those references if you have them handy." The moment of truth. I would have with me slips of paper with the reference info. Each would say the company, the general contact info for the company, and then one or more people with a role and some contact info specific to that person. I would hand them over with an explanation for each.
