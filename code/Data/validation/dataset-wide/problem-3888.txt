I have recently learned the polar factorization theorem for vector-valued functions due to Brenier. Namely, given a probability space $(X,\mu)$ and a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with the normalized Lebesgue measure (i.e. $\mathcal{L}^n(\Omega)=1$). Then there is a "polar factorization'' for a function $u\colon X\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $u(x)=\nabla \phi(s(x))$ (with very less regularity), where $s\colon X\to \Omega$ is measure-preserving, and $\phi\colon \Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ is convex. Brenier, Yann, Polar factorization and monotone rearrangement of vector-valued functions, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 44 (1991), no. 4, 375-417. The proof I know uses the theory of optimal transportation, for instance can be found in An elementary proof of the polar factorization of vector-valued functions. (English summary) Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 128 (1994), no. 4, 381-399. Since I am not very familiar with this field, I wonder whether there is some other known proof for this result. In particular, I am also interested in possible extensions of this result, say if we add more restrictions on $u$, can we conclude in the decomposition we have better regularity for $\phi$, say $\phi$ will be strictly convex, instead of convex? Similar for $s$. I am very grateful for possible comments and suggestions. 

I have a question on Riemannian geometry or CAT(k) geometry, which might be simple for experts. Suppose $M$ is a complete smooth Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above by $k>0$. Fix a ball $B\subset M$ with radius less than $\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{k}}$. Fix three points $P,Q,R\in B$. Denote by $PQ$ the unique geodesic that connects $P$ and $Q$ in $B$ and $QR$ the unique geodesic that connects $P$ and $R$. Let $Q_t\in PQ$ be the $t$-fractional point, that is, $d(p,Q_t)=td(p,Q)$ and $d(Q_t,Q)=(1-t)d(P,Q)$, and let $R_t\in PR$ be the $t$-fractional point as well. I wonder whether it is true that there exists a constant $c(k,t)>0$ such that $$d(Q_t,R_t)\le c(k,t)d(R,Q).$$ In case $k=0$, we know that we can choose $c(k,t)=t$. Any comments or references would be greatly appreciated. 

If you need a general regularity assumption on $f,g$ but no structural assumption on the shape of the level sets, I think the best one can do is to assume that $f,g$ are real analytic functions. (Of course this requires to drop the assumption of compact support). Then your set is subanalytic and in particular its boundary is made of a finite number of real analytic pieces. Anything less, e.g. $f,g$ in $C^\infty$, may produce a countable number of pieces plus a fat set where the two level sets touch each other (think Cantor). Can't you approximate your problem with real analytic functions? 

In the special case of purely real roots (hyperbolic polynomials), this problem was studied intensely in connection with hyperbolic equations. You can find a huge amount of information in this nice survey by Armin Rainer 

The question has been exhaustively answered, I'd like to add a remark. The way I view the Lebesgue integral is: to every positive measurable function you can associate a meaningful integral (i.e. stable by all natural operations and limit procedures), which might be infinite. Now if you have a sign-changing measurable function, you can assign an integral to its positive and its negative part. If one of the two is finite, then you can associate a meaningful integral to that function too. If both are infinite, there are ways to define an integral in some cases, but much less meaningful and stable; some natural operations become impossible to define or unstable in general. I find this a quite natural approach: in most theorems you can replace the assumption 'integrable' with 'whose integral is defined'. Also, it is pretty intuitive that if both areas above and below the $x$-axis are infinite, there is little point in defining the signed area of the whole region. Consider for instance the Fubini theorem (for $L^1$ functions) and its counterpart for positive functions, which we call the Tonelli theorem here in Italy. You can actually merge the two results and just say: if the integral of a measurable $f(x,y)$ is defined, then both iterated integrals are defined and give the same result as the double integral. 

I'm not a mathematician but I working on a problem that feels like it an example of a more general kind of problem and I'm hoping that someone might be able to point me in the right direction. The problem is trying to find a convex combination of different ways of ranking n items that satisfy certain constraints. Let me be more concrete: Suppose we have $n$ individuals with endowments $b_1 > b_2 > b_3 \ldots b_n$. There are positions $1 \dots n$, each of which gives a value of $v_1 > v_2 > v_3 \ldots v_n \ge 0$ that the individuals can be assigned to. I want to create a non-deterministic algorithm for assigning individuals to positions that is in some sense "equitable." so that for each individual, their expected proportional value from their positions is equal to their proportional endowment. E.g., suppose we have some method that assigns individual $i$ to position with 1 with probability $p_{i1}$, to position 2 with probability $p_{i2}$ and so on, I want it so that the algorithm generates an allocation such that: $\forall i, \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n p_{ij} v_j}{\sum_{j=1}^n v_j} = \frac{b_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n b_j} $ Some observations / thoughts: For this to work even in the n=2 case, we need to constrain $b_1$ to that it isn't proportionally larger than $v_1$ (otherwise even always placing individual 1 at position 1 wouldn't be enough). I originally thought this could be framed as a linear programming problem, where the goal is to find weights for each of the $n!$ possible orderings. Maybe this would work, but it would be computationally infeasible. A particularly nice approach might be one that sequentially assigns positions by having each remaining individual "buy" probability shares with their budget and then draw a winner. Unfortunately, this doesn't have the equitable property above, but I was thinking that perhaps if we thought of the allocation as happening repeatedly, we could give the "losers" (payoff from position too small) a bigger endowment, taken from the "winners" in such a way that expected payoff converges to the equitable outcome. Anyway, thanks for reading this far and I appreciate any comments, suggestions, answers etc. 

I have a function $u\in H^1_0(\Omega)$, $\partial\Omega$ being bounded and as nice as you need, and I need to prove that $u^k\in H^1_0(\Omega) $ for a fixed $k>1$ (integer if this can help). Certainly, this requires additional assumptions on $u$. For instance, if I know that $u$ is continuous up to the boundary, then this is also true of $u^k$ and gives the necessary conclusion. But expressing this condition in the Sobolev scale requires to assume that $u$ belongs to $H^s$ for $s$ larger than $n/2$. Are there weaker additional conditions on $u$ which ensure that $u^k\in H^1_0(\Omega)$? 

Let me try again (I deleted an earlier wrong post). First of all, a sufficient condition for subadditivity on $x>0$ is: $f(x)/x$ nonincreasing. This is easier to work with since it is a local condition. The proof is elementary (take $x\ge y>0$, then $f(x+y)\le f(x)(x+y)/x=f(x)+yf(x)/x\le f(x)+f(y)$). For smooth $f$ this is equivalent to $f'\le f/x$. Thus it is sufficient to look for a non concave function $f(x)$ which is smooth on $(0,\infty)$, has right limit zero at zero, and satisfies on $x>0$ the inequalities $$ 0\le f'(x) \le \frac f x.$$ Now, take $f=x^a$ with $ 0 < a < 1 $; we may start with any example, but just to fix the ideas. This is a concave function satisfying all the requirements of the problem. Notice that actually there exists $d>0$ such that $$ d\le f'(x) \le f'(x)+d \le \frac f x \text{ on } (0,1].$$ Any function satisfying this condition is a good starting point. We shall modify $f$ on a compact subset of $(0,1)$ so to make it non concave near a point. Let us take a smooth non negative cutoff $g \in C^2_c(0,1)$ such that $|g'|\le 1$ and define $f_t=f+tg$, for $t$ a small positive constant. We have $f'_t=f'+tg'$, so if we restrict $t$ to $ 0 < t < d $ we have $$ 0 \le f_t'\le \frac {f_t} x $$ everywhere. It is clear that $f_t$ for all $ 0 < t < d $ satisfies all the requirements of the problem. Can we choose $g$ so to make $f_t''(1/2)>0$? We have $$ f''_t(x_0)=f''(x_0)+t g''(x_0) $$ so in conclusion we are looking for a smooth function supported in a compact subset of $(0,1)$, non negative, such that $$ |g'|\le1 \text{ and } g''(1/2)\ge N $$ for a fixed $N$ arbitrarily large. This obviously exists, e.g. take a piecewise linear function and approximate it with test functions. 

I'm not a mathematician (I'm an economist) but I hope that this problem is sufficiently non-trivial that someone here will find it interesting. Motivation: I'm trying to model how workers decide what "skills" to acquire when (a) they have different innate abilities for different skills but (b) they face competitive pressure from others that also choose to acquire those skills. Problem: Suppose we have $N$ workers that can choose to belong in any of $M$ different groups. Multiple workers can belong to the same group; a worker can be in one and only one group at a time. They can jump from any group to any other group. A worker $i$ in group $j$ gets value $v_{ij}f(n_m)$ where $n_m$ is the number of workers in that group, and $f'(n_m) < 0$ and $f(1) = 1$ and as $n_m$ approaches infinity, $f$ approaches 0. $v$ is uniformly distributed. Workers jump between groups to try to maximize the value they receive. Graph theory formulation: I'm interested in the movement of workers between groups. I've modeled it as a directed graph, where each node is one possible configuration of workers among groups. Two nodes are connected if one worker changing states can convert one node to the other; edges point towards the greatest utility gain for the "jumping" worker. In simulations, I've found that the system always reaches an equilibrium where no worker wants to jump and I haven't been able to construct a counter-example. Conjecture: My conjecture is that this is a general property of graphs with this structure, i.e., for any directed graph with the $(m,n)$ structure described above, there exists at least one "sink" with no outgoing edges and that this sink is reachable from all other nodes. Ignoring values, it is possible to draw graphs without "sinks" but it leads to contradictions when I try to assign actual values to the worker-group pairings. None of the approaches I've tried so far seem promising enough to mention here.
