"Any hormonal changes" is a very broad question: Cortisol, insulin, glucagon, testosterone etc. Yes, I think it has repeatedly been proven that almost unloaded muscle work (e.g. walking) leads to an improved response to insulin. It is well known, that slightly loaded work stimulates the growths of red muscle fibers and myogenesis. Unloaded exercises for sure do not lead to overtraining and production of cortisol, and even moderate use of a muscle inhibits catabolic processes. And testosterone? You certaintly get a testosterone kick when do a perfect barbell snatch with a weight at the level of your PR, but even the size of the kick is releated to size of the weight, the kick originates from your brain more than from your muscles. Couldn't you get that kick too by doing unloaded flexings of your biceps in front of a mirror? ;) 

Start doing biceps curls and continue until your biceps feel tired and hurts terrible. Now you know how it feels, when you use your biceps. (You probably already knew that.) Doing exercises known to isolating just one muscle or muscle group let you learn how it feels, when you activate exactly that specific muscle, and this knowledge is easely reused doing more complicated exercises. Using this technic you can learn to feel even small deep muscles covered by larger muscles, like e.g. Gluteus medius. Of course, you need to know isolating exercises, and such exercises can commonly be found in the litterature. 

"No load" means no dumbell The study investigates "unilateral elbow flexion exercise". That is one arm bicep curls. The abstract says "without the use of an external load", which means no dumbell or other weight, but they did not mean without any load: Now, straighten your arm and do a bicep curl with your bicep brachii contracted as hard as you can through a full range of motion as stated in the abstract. You will A) Hit yourself in the face with your fist or B) Inhibit the movement by contracting your triceps too. I feel absolutely sure that B) is the case for the tests in this paper. This means, the load for the study is the maximum muscle tension allowed by the participant's nerve system. The tension is limited by their 'will' and by reciprocal inhibition (antagonist muscle relaxes when agonist muscle is flexed) Even if you do completely unloaded bicep curls you will still stimulate red muscle fibers. If any surprises in this study, I think it is the fact that reciprocal inhibition does not limit the use of the antagonist muscles as load and the participants has almost full hypertrophy in the arm exercised without weight. Perhaps this is due to the that participants most likely are untrained persons and they only completed 18 sessions. I think it would be a surprise, if you could do bodybuilding without any weights at all. 

Generally it's much easier to, for example, skip eating a banana than to go out jogging for fifteen minutes. Personally I feel it's even more so when your caloric deficiency is more than 500 kcal per day. This is all just anecdotal, so I'd try it out myself if I were you. But for myself I'd just do some heavy lifting to maintain muscle and then cut the bulk of the calories at the intake instead. 

I would suggest you skip the DVDs and get the StrongLifts app. It's a beginners strength program and the app makes it super easy to follow. If you're just switching to strength training I'm certain you'll see some really nice gains the coming months. Should you also want to keep your metcon up while using SL, then just throw in the odd Tabata workouts. Five minutes of intensive interval sprints will be more than enough. 

You will burn pretty much the same amount of calories running 1 kilometer really fast, as lightly jogging the same distance. When it comes to movement the distance is what decides how much energy you'll burn. Running the 1 km will, however, be much faster than the light jog. If you only have half an hour to train you'll be able to squeeze more kilometers into that session if you move faster – thus burning more calories. You might tire more quickly when going too fast, forcing you to rest and netting you less distance in the end of the session, than if you'd paced yourself. It sounds bad but this intensive training will increase you aerobic capacity over time and enabling you to go longer and faster as time goes by. This will let you burn more calories over the long term. Short term – go only as fast as you can maintain movement throughout the whole training session. Long term – mix it up with high intensity interval training to increase your aerobic capacity. 

No. Maltodextrin is absorbed almost as fast as grape sugar aka dextrose aka glucose. It is just an industrial replacement of pure starch. While glucose can be useful for drinks consumed during the games, it is not recommend for restitution. You will need slower carbohydrates preferably combined with smaller amounts of fat and protein to stabilize your blood sugar in the break and last during the next game. Even 150-200 kcal is a "small" meal compared to supposedly 600 kcal burned during the 60 minutes game, your body prefers a stable supply of energy. If you feel like your blood sugar is low right after the game and you need a boost, I will suggest you to eat a banana, which contains about that amount of calories you ask for and small amounts of fat and protein. It is absorbed much faster than whole grain products, but not as fast as maltodextrin dissolved into water. 

"These results extend previous studies" indicates that you can find similar studies in the reference list. 

I cannot tell you how to avoid the pain, only how to reduce it. Generally, I have a much better understanding of such kind of issues after I began doing yoga. I can not repeat what yogis say here. This would just make you laugh: Strange statements like "feel the energy running up from the earth and through all your body". However, when I do what I think they want me to do, I feel much better. First, press your hips upwards and keep a high tension in the deep abs. This is not yoga, but how you perform this exercise in a correct manner. Then press your lower shoulder backwards and down and keep a high tension like you do in many other exercises. Never sack in the shoulder. Now, if you know the warrior exercises from yoga and how to press your legs together, it is an advantage. While you keep the arm you rest on in a vertical position, then think about pressing your forearm down and towards the legs, and even it seems impossible, the legs down and towards the forearm. If you do things right, you will feel it like the weight of your body is suddenly reduced. So are the pains. As a part of writing this answer, I did this exercise for 2½ minute and the only reason to I went down was that my abs was shaking. I felt only insignificant pain in the lower elbow. Before yoga, I always had to stop because of pains in elbow and shoulder. 

Stretch jeans! Also has the added benefit of highlighting the results of your leg work. ;) Other than that, get a pair that fits your upper legs and take them to a tailor for adjustments. 

Hard to say anything definite without seeing a video or pictures but I'm thinking it could be a combination of a weak core and faulty technique. Try doing the plank and back raises, without and with added weight, and see how it feels. Does it hurt similarly? As for diagnosing your form: look in a mirror to see the curvature of your back, as you're pressing. It should be pretty straight – otherwise you risk overextending and hurting your back. You can also try laying down on your back and having someone put their hand under the small of your back. Tighten your core and press down against the hand – that's the form you want to press from. If the pain is located very high up, you could experiment with your grip width. Does wider feel better than smaller? Also try to push your elbows out, so you're not pressing in front of yourself as much as straight from the sides. Hope that helps! Else please upload a video so we can check your form. Of course, if it keeps hurting I would strongly recommend also seeing a proper physio in person. 

You are mixing two assertions. One is that many pushups doesn't require a lot of strength and another is that it doesn't build strength. The first is false but the second is kind of true. The stronger you are, the easier it gets and thus the more you can manage. If you can bench press 100 kg then it'll be very easy to rep out with just a 20 kg bar. However, if you're 1RM is 30 kg then you'll struggle going beyond 4-5 repetitions. A high-repetition scheme does build some strength but is far inferior to low-rep/high-resistance in that regard: 

Do not regret this break from your weightlifting and take the opportunity to become an even better weightlifter. The trainers I have had, most often has used about half of the workout for yoga exercises to improve flexibility, range, mobility and core strength. Exercises like over-the-head-squats demands extremely high flexibility. You can highly improve quality of your squats by doing air squats in front of a mirror. You can improve your core strength and stability far beyond what you think is possible just by doing functional training and calisthenics - without any equipment. If you can afford a little for a smaller device, I will definitely recommend you a cheap suspension-trainer aka TRX (cheap ones are as good as the expensive ones), which you easily can attach to a door, and sliding exercises like this: $URL$ You can just use floor-cloths for sliding exercises. I use to do so. If you dare to try advanced exercises, Switch ball can take your weightlifting to the next level, but I recommends proper instructions. If you have room for more than that, then get inspiration from crossfit and use sandbags (or water bags), tires, logs, etc. as weights. 

According to a leading expert in the field, Daniel Ramskov, you should choose the shoes, which makes you feel most comfortable, when you run. This means the most objective criteria for choosing the right shoes is your subjective experience of the shoes. Do they feel good, then they are good for the purpose. This advice is valid for avoiding injuries as well as for selecting the shoes for the best performance. (Run faster, better endurance) Science can't prove any other correlations and expensive analyses are usually waste of time and money. Take a look at his (and his colleagues) work. 

It will, up to a point. If you can only do 5-10 straight reps before having to break then it's still heavy enough to build decent muscle for you. Once you can do around fifteen or more in a row, however, it'll start to become decreasingly effective. 

Sweating is your body's way of cooling down and it has nothing to do with burning calories. If you wanted to measure that you'd look for how much and hard you're panting – that's the fat oxidising away. The amount of sweat can very a lot from person to person and not sweating during a workout is of course okay but I'd question if you'd really gone as hard as you could have. 

I was in the same situation a year or so after starting working out. It just plateaued. Though I will say it's easy to think your progress has stalled, when in fact you just don't measure it. Get a caliper for your body fat, measure tape for circumferences, a scale for bodyweight, weekly photos and record that. The biggest bang for your buck is in your diet. If you haven't given it a lot of thought before you will see incredible results after cleaning it up. There's many, many ways to go about it and you'll have zealots for every one of them, proclaiming their superiority. However, they all work because they force you to control your intake and be conscious about what you eat. My recommendation would be to eat lots and lots of veggies (biggest portion of your plate) and make sure you get around 2 gram of protein per kilo bodyweight (whether that's from legumes, nuts, grains, meat or egg – that's up to you). Measure the food! Put it in a food log like MyFitnessPal. That's the only way you will know your intake and you should not skip this step. Next is exercise. If you can't squat twice your bodyweight I would switch to a beginners strength program with linear progression. My personal favorite is StrongLifts but some people like Starting Strength too. The important part here is the built-in progressional load – it keeps pushing you to lift heavier and heavier, thus helping you break through plateaus. Add in 5-10 minutes of intense Tabata as often as you feel you can still progress. Sprints, rower, skipping rope, etc. Go as hard as you can for 20 seconds and then slower for 10. Rinse and repeat.
