I wrote this answer to collect the ideas of the answer of Rex Kerr, the answer of Adam.r and the comments of Karolis Juodele in one place and to add some of my ideas to them. I think I came up with a good necessary condition that differentiates between situations 1,2. Definition 1: The visual atomic words is the set of words: distance in x-direction, distance in y-direction, distance in z-direction in some coordinate system, colors, colors: red, yellow,..., ( I know that it is better to define colors using wavelengths, but please ignore that for the moment). The math atomic words are all mathematical terms (can be made precise if one knows that ZFC is the foundation of mathematics). I will call the union of the set of visual atomic words and the set of math atomic words the set of atomic words and denote it A. One may use words from the set A without defining them, thus I call them the set of atomic words. I will now define the terms "practical hypothesis" and "scientific hypothesis". Definition 2: A practical hypothesis is a hypothesis that has all words defined using words from the set A. A theoretical hypothesis is a hypothesis that is not practical. For example the hypothesis that the shortest path between any two points is a straight line is a practical hypothesis since all words it contains can be defined using words from set A. The hypothesis that the earth revolves around the sun is a practical hypothesis as well. "The hypothesis that objects denser than iron fall to the ground when let go" is a practical hypothesis as well (One may argue that there are implicit notions of mass and time in these hypotheses, but these can be defined again using the distance measurements of the equipment used to measure them). Both of hypotheses 1,2 are theoretical hypotheses unless one gives a definition of the words "force", "create" using only words from the set A. (People may argue that force may be defined as mass*acceleration, but my opinion is that this does not take into account forces like normal contact force). 

The word color has 3 different definitions, depending on context. When speaking about the color of an object, we're referring to a property of the object. Which wavelengths of light it absorbs or reflects. When we speak about the color of light, we're referring to it's wavelength or the combination of wavelengths from which it is comprised. When it comes to visual perception, we're referring to hue. So a red balloon (property) under blue light (wavelength) appears black (hue). Light has no hue, but it does have different wavelengths, which result in the perception of corresponding hues. 

Surely an omnipotent being could travel back in time and create the circumstances leading to His creation. This would solve the problem of endless regression. Is it really altogether impossible that the eventual conclusion of evolution is the creation of an omnipotent, eternal, all-knowing being? 

Is it possible that consciousness arose because of the conflict between 'self interest' and 'pack interest'? Does the 'level of consciousness' depend on the 'size of the pack'? Humans are social creatures. That's just a nice way of saying that we're pack animals. But packs don't work if each individual only looks after his own best interest. This is why we evolved emotions such as guilt and pride. 

Kants take on reality is that we perceive indirect reality. This is the belief that we perceive the representation of the world (our brains interpretation of reality) and not the real world (The world outside our heads). This is the generally accepted view and neurology has gone a long way in confirming it. Does this mean we can never see the real world? Will we only ever perceive the representation of objects, or can we see the actual object? 

Let's use a current dilemma I'm facing. Is visible light, visible? Replace (God) with (visible light) and (The bible) with (insert a dictionary of your choice), and it's the exact same situation. Most of the answers I'm getting are along the lines of: (It's called visible light. Visible implies that we can see it. Therefore we can see light.) It's hard to argue with such logic. But my argument is not, about the definition of visible. My argument is whether light itself is actually visible. What are the factors which determine whether an object is visible or not. Why is this particular type of light, called visible light. I'm in no way saying that a visible object is not visible. It's this circular reasoning which prevents people from seeing the question I'm actually asking. Your question is open to interpretation. You need to explain your argument to specifically exclude irrelevant interpretations. 

The important point is that its not that there was something called ontology which became intertwined with something called theology and produced a third thing called metaphysics. Its rather a complete reverse of this: metaphysics has always left unthought the identity between ontology and theology that has been implicit in it. Its only now, at the end of a process that separates something we call "ontology" from something we call "theology" that the relationship between them comes into question at all. 

One might think here of curator displays and, indeed, the way some art is treated as revered objects, as if they possessed some sort of higher order. Its this sense of "mystery" and "transcendence" that's withered away in the "loss" of aura. But, moreover, this loss inaugurates a new understanding of art altogether: 

Longer niceties: You're right to highlight the evasion in the "everyone." In ยง51, Heidegger address this more or less head on, where he deals with the similar idea: "One also dies at the end, but for now one is not involved." 

This sounds very little like how we tend to speak of "substance". Among other things, why does "conception" enter into this definition of "substance"? Of course, whether it in any obvious sense sounds like "reality" or even "essence" can only be seen by following how Spinoza uses "substance" within the Ethics. And here we come to what is actually Durant's point, which he states pretty clearly in the paragraph after the one you quoted: 

This "unique existence" encompasses not just the work of art as it is, but also seemingly its being embeded in a tradition, its history, which allows for a certain ascription of "authenticity" to the original work of art. This ascription is not merely accidental, but involves a mode of perception. All of this is encompassed by the term "aura," hence, the famous passage that describes what has changed with the introduction of the mechanical reproduction of art: 

Existence can't be proven objectively, but the simple process of questioning existence, proves existence. If you did not exist, you could not ask the question, "Do I exist?", therefore you know you exist. But proving you exist to someone else is impossible. We can postulate which is the most plausible view, but ultimately, every view relies on accepting an ultimate truth which is unprovable. 

It's not actually a mental process, it's physiological. Each cone is linked to the visual cortex via it's own optic nerve. A cone on the bottom of your retina is linked to a spot on the top of the visual cortex. Cones on the left of the retina are linked to the right of the visual cortex. It's a mechanical inversion of the image, not a mental process. 

Blame and accountable are two different things. I can blame the destruction caused by a tornado on the tornado, but I can't hold the tornado accountable. The key is intention. Likewise, if a person does something, they are to blame. That's just factual. A man speeding down a road and hitting someone is not charged with murder unless it can be proved he intentionally hit the person. 

There seems to be much confusion around this topic. Our eyes detect light, but do they see? Detecting light is part of the visual process. The end result is that objects become visible. This occurs in the brains visual centres. No perception occurs in the actual eye itself. Your thoughts? 

To see, means to consciously perceive, unlike detect, which is a mechanical process, which requires no consciousness. A infrared camera can detect light, but it sees nothing. We, humans, see a representation of reality. As answered by my question, "Do we really see objects?", we perceive our brains representation of objects, not the objects themselves. But what of light? Do we see actual electromagnetic radiation, or do we perceive brightness, because of light? 

The first, as Kahn points out in his excellent commentary, The Art and Thought of Heraclitus, offers a democratisation of the Delphic oracle's famous injunction gnothi seauton, "know thyself," which suggests something that is hard to do, something that only few can achieve. Yet, Heraclitus seems to be saying that, however hard it may be, it is something incumbent on everyone, and hence something everyone is capable of. Yet, despite this sense of capacity, it is clear that Heraclitus has a sense that very few fulfil this capacity, thus, for example: 

The key is that this a battle that is already going on. [***]: It is controversial just how "Marxist" Benjamin intends to be, but I'll leave that aside. 

Here, Socrates is expressly thinking of the written word as an image of speech. I may write something down, but what I write down most properly belongs to a dialogical context which will be lost in its being written. Unlike in a dialogical context, my written words cannot be subjected to interrogation. Removed from this spoken context, the written word loses its life. Here, what is favoured is the face-to-face context which is taken to be the more authentic means of communication, because in face-to-face communication, the person who speaks is present to us: we may question that person to see for ourselves if what he or she has to say is truly wise. It is presence in this sense that is meant by the "metaphysics of presence." What is at stake is not the way in which something is present to us, but that we take certain modes of presentation as being more authentic and truer than other modes of presentation. What the deconstruction of the metaphysics of presence (ugh... what a phrase...) tries to do (roughly) is to uncover these more or less automatic structures of privilege and bring this structure of privilege into question.
