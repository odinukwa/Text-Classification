The rather fuzzy term that you are using is pretty similar to a popular trope in science fiction, namely that of the Sufficiently Advanced Alien as e.g. seen in Star Trek with the Q. Such being does not necessarily need to transcend the laws of nature and can still be bound by them. It may be that it only has a better understanding of nature. Or it may have "ascenced to a higher plane of existence" (what ever that may mean). Especially your statement that: 

Humans and other animals have no direct control of what they want. Your "personality" is not a cause in itself, independent from nature. It is very dependent on the wiring of your brain, which again is dependent on the genome and the experience you made throughout your life. Hence, you can only realize what you want and may act according to it. If you can act on your desires you experience joy, if you cannot you experience distress. Or as Schopenhauer once said: "Man can do what he wants but he cannot want what he wants." Also being able to supress certain desires is not a sign that we control our desires, as the desire to control such desires is a desire, too. That being said, there are ways to train ourselves to behave according to a socially accepted manner, be it through positive reinforcement or punishment. Or by gaining insight for the necessity of (not) doing an action through learning, either by making mistakes in the real world or by making thought experiments. Or by learning how other people did things in the past and prevent us from doing mistakes again. 

I'm not quite sure what is meant with "superstition" in this case. Does he mean that if something has happened in the past or in the now, that it is not good enough to assume it will happen again? As I read it, he claims that I would be superstitious to assume an apple is edible because of my past and present experiences with things that seemed to be apples. And while it could happen that somehow an apple turns toxic, I think the term "superstition" does not directly apply here. As I have good reasons to assume so, yet I know I could be false. And it seems to me that there is no alternative to being this "superstitious" in order to cope with what one perceives to be reality. We humans must infer future events out of out past experiences. It may also be that I am pondering too strong on the term "superstition" having a bad connotation with me and it may be used differently than one would normally call superstition. I really would like some clarification. 

How do you know that hurting you was the person's intent and not just simply a mistake? And if you perceive an action as inappropriate, maybe you have a too strict of a view of how other people should behave? Is e.g. Marilyn Manson an artist who expresses himself or an inappropriate human being that should be banned to perform an his CD be burned? Yet let's assume that all people could act good (for whichever definition of goodness you want to apply): If everybody was acting good then there would be no need to label humans in categories of good and bad behaviour. In a world without an illness the term "health" would lose its purpose and we could do without the label. How would you find the the notion to wish for an illness in such a world just so one can make the distinction between healthy and sick people? From a philantrophic perspective that seems absurd. I hence would reject the notion that it would be good for some to be evil. The real question that it is hiding is what kind of behaviour is deemed good? And how to define what is evil? As there is no universal understanding what those terms mean, unless you are operating under the premise that a divine being commands what ought to be good and what ought to be bad, it is not possible to declare a state in which all people would be good. Also, is an action in itself evil or does it depend on the intent? Is it always evil to steal or is something else if you steal expensive medicine for a sick friend of yours? Human values are changing over times and so the perception what is considered good and bad does so as well. The statement "It's good to be bad" is only ever used by Disney villains that are bad simply for the reason of being bad. No human that has, from our perspective, committed attrocities ever sees onself as the bad guy, the think they are the good guys. That is also why I would opt for not using the terms good and evil to describe human behaviour. We should ask ourselves in what kind of society we want to live in and what methods we want to use to achieve it, completly without obscuring the matter with a fuzzy notion of good or evil. Some societies have declared war to be a central part of their culture, and a hero death was the most respected one. Other people want to live in a peaceful way together on this planet and have as much fun while being here and then die in their sleep. 

I am not aware if there exists a label for this kind of theism, yet a few religions and sects and other esoteric world views have include this way of thinking at least to some degree. A current one would be Mormonism whose believers claim by its doctrine of Exaltation that "human beings can grow and progress spiritually until ... they can inherit and possess all that the Father hasâ€”they can become gods". 

I had a discussion about drones for civilian use, e.g. self-driving cars without a human at its wheels, transport devices that would fly products you otherwise would buy in the supermarket directly to your home, and robots that collect trash from the streets all by themselves. The most controversial issue was of who takes the responsibility for damages caused by such a drone. A list of potential candidates were: 

So it becomes clear that the person does not both believe both p and NOT p. He also does not state something trivial, as it conveys a self-assessment. One could question the reason for the self-assessment in order to determine how valid it is. It is nonetheless a useful statement for us humans and we use this approach in our everyday life a lot in order to deal with uncertainties. 

In contrast to the mere consequential answer, I would argue for a more liberal, preference utilitarian, Golden-Rulish approach: If and only if the person in question gives their informed consent such an act is ethical. Neither did the boy consent for his memory to be erased nor had he any insight of the impact of such a procedure. This would mean we would have ignored his preference, and that alone is reason enough not to do, never minding any proclaimed "greater good". The question should not be "Should I do it?", but from this point of view one should reject the notion of having the power of allowing or denying it for someone else. It's not your call, yet you may recommend someone to change their memory or discourage someone from having their memory changed it, as long as you accept their final answer even if it disagrees with your preference. What acts shall remain in this personal decision space of the individual's preference is of course open to debate. For this answer, I have assumed that one own's memory falls under this category. 

So I disagree that logic shows how our brains are supposed to work. Logic is our way to formalize valid reasoning as opposed to fallacious one in order to make clear where our human mind is prone to error. Some aspects when people are disagreeing can indeed be rational vs irrational, as certain aspects of how the universe works has be shown quite well and has yet to be falsified (e.g. evolution as rational belief vs intelligent design as an irrational one). Yet often people are disagreeing because they value things differently. It is hard to determine who is "irrational" if one wants to uphold freedom of speech while someone else wants to protect human dignity. These groups of people are clashing not because one is irrational, but because they have different priorities in ethic values. 

It all depends on the definition of atheism. I do not share your definition of atheism in its broadest sense as a rejection of belief in deities. In its broadest sense, atheism merely states not making a positive claim of the necessary existence of any deity. An atheist is simply not a theist. Nothing more, nothing less. An atheist does not necessarily know they are an atheist, as they may have not been introduced to a certain god concept yet. Is such a position scientific viable: Yes, as each hypothesis must have some merit in explaining world we live in. The god-hypothesis does not solve any problem, it obscures it. Replace a god did it with a with wizard did it and it would as much as revealing. Does it mean that each atheist acts scientifically? No, because an atheist still can uphold other irrational views. Such as homeopathy, astrology or conspiracy theories. As to arguing that agnosticism would be the scientific position, well, this too stems from your strict definition of atheism as rejection of belief. Just ask some self-proclaimed atheists, and you realize that many atheists and I disagree with that notion. There is this misconception that agnosticism would be some kind of middle ground. Agnosticism is the notion that something cannot be known. Not that one is unsure which of multiple positions is true. I would argue that atheism entails rational agnosticism as a subset. Since if you think something cannot be known, it would be irrational to claim "I think it cannot be known, but I believe it is true independent from any evidence whatsoever". What I very much do reject is the notion that Darwin made it possible to be an "intellectually fulfilled atheist". There were many before him that had reason enough to be atheistic, e.g. in Ancient Greece. Darwin merely made a strong argument for evolution which contradicts many but not all religions. Evolution in itself has nothing to do with atheism. Assuming evolution would not have been discovered, I would still be an atheist. Confronted with the question of the origin of our species I would simply state: "I do not know." As with everything: Stating that one does not know is often the rational decision. Introducing a god to fill that gap is not necessary. 

is by its very definition a statement that you are . So before saying, "I am an atheist" I must have been confronted with the in order to distance myself from that particular group of theists. (That by itself is no proof of any though, just like the does not bring into existence.) Just like words as only make sense when there is an concept of to begin with. If people would not become sick, we would not have a word for , as it would be conveyed by default whenever we used the term . Just as only becomes meaningful when people . This should also avoid the typical counter-argument that this definition would make rocks atheists, as those lack the ability to be theists in the first place. Even though one could describe their external features as atheistic, but that's quite a trivial thing to say. So when I as a child confronted with , such as and I treated those stories as fairy tales. So I realized "I was not a Christian", and I was also not a believer in Greek gods, and more and more I learned about all the religions on this planet I realized that I could not identify with anything they claimed to be true (even though not all of them were necessarily theistic, so I also may be better described as non-religious). The most broadest definition, I can boil / down to, is the positive claim that one or many divine beings necessarily exist. And I do not claim that. Hence I am not a theist. Hence I am an atheist. It may be that 's theism may not fall under this definition, though I do not think of it as likely or a useful thing to do. Yet in order for me to "prove" my atheism to particular religion I would ask him to tell me what entails, and tell him if I agree with it. If I say: "I do not subscribe to the presented claims" it is really all the proof you can take, good reasons approach if you will, even though I may be lying and a believer anyway. But why would I lie? There are quite a few ad-hoc rationalizations (denial of a god, being angry to a certain god, etc. pp.) and even though I cannot stop from raising them, it would be the point for me to stop the discussion as futile. For now, I feel quite rational in my poly-atheism of all the theisms I have yet encountered, and am quite biased in remaining an atheist of all the theisms I have yet to encounter, due to the huge lack of evidence any religion has yet presented and the scientific discoveries concerning the underlying principle of all religions. Yet I could be wrong. I want to point out that I also start to consider myself as an atheist retrospectively, once I decided to ascribe the term "atheist" to myself. Just as I think of myself as always being a boy even though I only learned the difference as a small child.
