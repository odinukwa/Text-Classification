Using workers' income figures in specific sectors may be difficult, since some sectors relied a lot on slaves (e.g. mining), and others may have used different sources of manpower in different geographic regions (e.g. agriculture: free workers in Italy, slaves in Sicily). So the income aproach may be difficult. Likewise, the expenditure approach may be complex, unless we have access to data on the consumption of goods (through the amount of taxation levied upon goods, perhaps?) This would leave us with the production approach, i.e. determine the amount of goods produced in each geographical region, find market prices for these goods, multiply getting the production value per sector and per region. Just an impression I have: maybe the Roman Empire is actually a good place to try this out, since a relatively small types of goods seem to have occupied a disproportionately large proportion of trade. Transport of olive oil, wine, wheat, metals (and slaves?) would cover a large part of what has been found in shipwrecks. Of course, this should not let us forget smaller production of goods not offered up for trade. Brassica in Campania would have mostly been consumed locally. But it may give a rough idea of the relative importance of productive sectors. What I am wondering about is how to estimate the importance of the terciary sector. May not be easy when doctors, scribes, et al. will often have been slaves bought for the task. HTH 

Is there a reliable objective study that addresses this issue? No. There are several dimensions that would have to be addressed. I can hint at what they are, with the intention of exposing some of the inherent conflicts of such an inquiry. First, there is no doubt that various laws and court cases that were established in the 1950s and 1960s ended institutional racism. Johnson was instrumental in some of these, but they were not necessarily 'Great Society'. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, in particular, was not an attempt at an economic program, it was focused on eliminating state laws that institutionalized discrimination. 'Great Society' acted pro-actively, often but not always in economic terms. Head Start is one educational program that most view as an unqualified success. Over the span of it's existence, it has consistently helped the children that were enrolled in the program. The Higher Education Act of 1965 vastly expanded federal funding of higher education, including the provision of low interest student loans. The value of this is probably described as a bell curve, with positive and negative aspects evenly distributed around the mean. On the one hand, many people who deserved access to higher education were able to act on it. On the other hand, many of those who enrolled were viewed as not having met the same qualification criteria as non-minority students, and felt ostracized. Retrospectives on this aspect suggest this caused real harm. It may also have created more systemic hazards. As the Federal Government supplies more and more of the money to higher education, it also politicizes campus policies, and has created severe distortions that in some cases impinge on student freedom of speech and due process. It also appears to be suffering a problem similar to crop subsidies, more students are graduating with degrees than can find jobs that require college educations. This can negatively affect minorities that don't have college or even high school educations, as they are crowded out by non-minorities with more complete attainment. Larger Economic Framework The industrial revolution sparked a collection of redistributionist philosophies, Marxism being one of them. While social systems are always redistributionist to some degree, the doctrine of economic central planning didn't really take hold until Stalin took control of the Soviet Union. Just because the communists took over in 1918 doesn't mean that the central planning apparatus suddenly materialized out of nowhere, this took time to implement. The experience with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany also appeared in the 1930s, particularly after Germany had been through the hyperinflation of the 1920s. Therefore, at the point in time that MLK was proposing a restructuring of the US economy, 'the facts weren't in'. While the German and Italian economies had been released from centralized authority, little was really understood about how the Soviet experiment was running. It would be another decade or two for the bankruptcy of that order to be certain. In the meantime, in the period from 1945 to 1972, the US 'owned the world'. Europe and Japan were rebuilding from nearly total destruction. The US population exploded from about 135 million to 200 million between 1945 and 1963. This triggered massive construction of housing, freeways, aircraft, telecommunications infrastructure, and consumer goods. With the arrival of television, those that were locked out of this economic bounty were seeing it day to day, one can review any number of the classic 1960s sitcoms to imagine how that was being received by people living in tenements. The idea that someone halfway through their life in the 1960s now had the 'opportunity' to get better employment, was, overall, pretty useless. Without education or experience someone at age 35 was not going to shift from warehousing to doctor or attorney. This would take time, for many, they had been waiting long enough. Given the economic power of the US at the time, the idea that it should be shared had a lot of political support. Thus it was easy to enact rafts of legislation for Medicare, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, student loans, etc. Many of these didn't go all that far at the time, such programs were expanded later, both in terms of services provided and as to who was served. This has created a massively larger government, and is coincident with deficit spending and rapidly rising government debt. The legislation that was enacted in the 1960s would have been 'affordable' if it had remained in it's original scale. The two problems were that the scale expanded, and that people became dependent - not merely as recipients but as government workers employed in the vast bureaucracy. Many of these workers are minorities - people that wouldn't have had such jobs had the agencies didn't exist. Needless to say, as government employees they are better off than they might be sweeping streets, however in this role they do not face market forces, and therefore have little incentive to adapt to changing circumstances. What we are finding now is that attempts to simply downsize government and reign-in public sector benefits is a 'third rail', touch it and you're dead. As this continues, the government continues to draw a disproportionate slice of the economic pie, leaving everyone worse off. 

I am not certain of the fifth ribbon's identity, but it seems to match, and it is possible that it could have been awarded after September 8th when Italy signed the armistice and joined the Allies. 

Those are Service Ribbons, which denote which medals a soldier has been awarded without having the medals themselves displayed on their uniform. Yours appears to be from a British or Commonwealth soldier during World War 2. Your ribbons are from a Polish Soldier operating under British Commonwealth Command in Italy during World War 2, possibly as part of the II Corps (found by extrapolating from your username). The medals these represent (that I have found are), 

During WW2, submarines on patrol were out of contact with friendly forces for extended periods of time. Even when operating in a Wolf-Pack, they generally couldn't tell exactly where their pack-mates were or how they were doing. While they could broadcast their status using their radios, this was limited to avoid radio intercepts and direction finding giving away their presence in an area. This meant that more often than not, the first indication that a boat was lost was either a boat missing a radio check-in or the boat being overdue on returning to port (an example of this is the Wahoo). However, without confirmation of the boat actually being lost, they would still be marked as On Patrol. Removing the boat would be admitting the boat, and its crew, were gone. Leaving it as On Patrol turned into a mark a of respect for those lost, and the tradition stuck. 

Basically, what can be seen here is that the 1054 Crab Nebula supernova is at about 20 degrees removed from the sun during daylight hours, when at maximum emission. It must have been difficult to see in this conjunction, as are the planets Mercury and Venus when very close to the Sun. Difficult - but not impossible. Moreover, this difficulty would have been precisely the same, seen either from North-Western Europe or from East Asia. At earlier or later dates, the Sun would have been further apart from the supernova thus lessening glare, but the supernova's own emission levels were much lower. Now, consider where the supernova has been documented from: very clearly in China and Japan, with perhaps one observation from the Middle East. Does this mean it was not observed in Europe? One must think not, even though local conditions could have interfered: increased cloud cover or volcanic emissions. These could have had an influence in some parts of Europe, but not on a sufficient scale to affect the complete continent[2]. Thus, we are confronted by a natural phenomenon that, from a physical standpoint, could very well have been observed from Europe as from Asia, but that has been clearly documented only in the East. To my mind, this is already a significant development, leading us to a series of questions: 

With respect to Britain, there was an understanding between Churchill and Roosevelt that the UK would free it's colonies after the war. Atlantic Charter Specific terms described in this article are 'A key American aim was to force a change of British policy in regard to its Empire. America realized the precarious position of Britain, reliant as she was on US military aid, and intended to exploit this by forcing a commitment to self-determination, and an open door policy on resources.'. France still had colonies in Africa after WW II. Many of the French colonies were granted self-determination in the 1950s and 1960s. Some of these were the result of bloody insurgencies, particularly in Algeria. WW II exposed the true cost of defending far flung possessions. Britain, with a population of 40 million, was responsible for defending the quarter of the Earth's surface that it 'possessed' going into WW II. Most of Europe had lost interest in military adventures following the carnage of WW I. Once it was clear further military investment would be essential, European countries ended most claims of sovereignty outside their historical borders. Exceptions tend to be islands that continue to rely on defense and civil administration from a much larger host. 

Clockwise from the top of the star (left side of the picture) - France, Belgium, Russia, Italy, UK Which corresponds to the major Allied Powers in WW1 before the entry of the United States and the exit of Russia. The Russian Symbol is a bit hard to identify, but it was probably chosen to differentiate the Flag of Russia from the French Tricolor, since the orientations of the flags seem variable for this card. 

After WW2, the German currency (The Reichsmark) took a large hit in value, both due to losing the war, and the Soviets continuing to print RMs (precisely to prevent the economic recovery of Germany). The Western Governments, to facilitate the recovery of (Western) Germany introduced the Deutsche Mark (DM), which the Soviets disapproved of, banning the use of the DM in the eastern sector, while introducing their own new currency for their sector. Due to Berlin's status as an enclave within the Soviet zone, the Western Allies did not initially introduce the DM to Berlin, seeking a agreement with the Soviets. As the Soviets were against the new currency in general, they refused, and decided to introduce their new currency to their sector, including Berlin. This led to the West introducing the DM to their sectors of Berlin The introduction of the DM to Berlin was what precipitated the Blockade, and one of the goals of the Soviets was to force West Berlin to adopt the Eastern Currency. By forcing the West Berliners to purchase food from the east, the Soviets would have insured that the only currency they could use was theirs. Due to the success of the Airlift, this was never required of West Berlin, which kept the DM over the East Mark. The precipitating reason for the blockade is on page 18 of Miller's To Save a City.
