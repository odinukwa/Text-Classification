Pagan believers exist in Europe even now. But if you are asking of the last country which became officially Christian, this was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the grand duke Jogaila converted to Christianity (Catholicism) in 1387. (Some earlier grand dukes converted earlier but then relapsed). After the Grand Duke conversion, Christianity was forced on all population, but of course this was a long process. Some pagan communities remained on the European territory of the Russian empire till 19s century. Conversion of a country at that time meant conversion of the leader (prince, king). After that Christianity was usually enforced on the rest of population, but this always took some time. But the grand Duchy was the last officially pagan state, though a large part of its population (living on the territory of the former Rus principalities) was Christian (Orthodox) since earlier times. Conversion of the Grand Duchy happened as a result of dynastic union with Poland (Jogaila married a Polish princess) and eventually the states united to a single state called Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narod√≥w (Republic of Two Nations, usually translated into English as Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). It was partially Catholic (Poland and proper Lithuania) and part Orthodox (former Rus principalities). Even before the union with Poland, the Grand Duchy was the largest state (by territory) in Europe, so certainly it was not a ``fringe''. Well, perhaps the largest after the Golden Horde, the European part of it, if this can really be called a state. To the East of the Rzeczpospolita was the Grand Duchy of Moscovia, the state which in 14s century was still dependent of the Golden Horde, though some maps show it as an independent state. As Moscovia was still in Europe, the Rzeczpospolita was in no sense on a fringe, but rather in Central Europe. 

Germany did not interfere in the Russian civil war after the Paris conference. Before the defeat, Germany helped Bolsheviks to seize power, and concluded the Brest treaty with them (separate peace). As a result of this treaty Germans occupied Ukraine. After the defeat, and Paris conference, they evacuated their troops from Ukraine, which made possible the conquest of the Ukraine by the Bolshevik Russia. In the later years both Bolsheviks and Germany were in international isolation, so they co-operated in many areas. But Germany did not really meddle in the Russian civil war. 

Economy of the period is analysed in the book by Bryan Ward-Perkins, Fall of Rome and the end of civilization (Oxford UP, 2006).The author gives abundant evidence that the fall of the empire was accompanied by a collapse of economy, material production and infrastructure in general. The evidence is based on contemporary accounts and archeological data. However it is not completely clear whether the collapse of the economy was the reason or a consequence of the fall of the empire. My impression from the evidence presented in this book is that it was rather a consequence. The reason for destruction of economy was apparently collapse of administration, as a result of civil wars and invasions. EDIT. Another recent book on the subject, Adrian Goldsworthy, The fall of the West. The death of the Roman superpower, (US title: How the Rome Fell), 2009 attibutes the fall of the empire to the constant internal struggle for power. It was so intense that the emperors cared more about their own survival than for the survival of the empire. The result was invasion of the tribes, which in turn led to the collapse of the central government and of the economy. 

The information on existence of this book comes from Pappus (who lived about 500 years after Archimedes). By the "sphere" they mean what is called planetarium now, it is a mechanical model of the solar system. Some writers mention that Archimedes actually made one or more. Marcellius, the Roman general who looted Syracuse brought one to Rome and donated to a temple. Several Roman writers have seen it, and mention it, but none of them understood enough about astronomy to give a reasonable description. Ref. $URL$ There are further references there. 

They did not enclose corn fields and cattle pastures inside the walls of a castle. Such walls would be too long and need too many people to defend. Most of the food during a siege came from supplies. But supplies (of grain and other products like this) can be stored for very long time (for years). Many castles had wells. Some could have vegetable gardens. But about pasture for cattle or fields to grow grain inside the walls I have never heard. 

All our system of exact dating of events of ancient history is based on Babylonian astronomical observations. There is a large number of astronomical cuneiform tables found in Mesopotamia. Only in British Museum there are 20,000 of them. They are dated and contain various astronomical data (positions of the Moon, planets, eclipses etc.) which can be verified. Many of them have been published in the book: Astronomical cuneiform texts; Babylonian ephemerides of the Seleucid period for the motion of the sun, the moon, and the planets. Three volumes.1955 by O. Neugebauer. Astronomical observation records from Babylon cover almost continuously the period since Nabonassar (747-734 b.c.). So dating the observations is possible since this time. This was done already by Ptolemy who passed to us the so-called "Canon of Kings" which is the list of Babylonian rulers since Nabonassar to his days, with dates. Cuneiform texts deciphered only in 19th century confirm this list, and it is actually the foundation for exact dating of events of the ancient history. Once the correspondence of any calendar with Babylonian one is established, we have the exact dating, accurate to one day. 

I do not know much about history of Philippines, but usually it is better to have several different perspectives. National historians are frequently biased, but some foreign historians may be biased as well. The best books that I read about recent history of Russia, for example are written by British and US historians. And I would be delighted to read a history of Greek-Persian wars written by a (contemporary) Persian historian. Unfortunately it does not exist. 

By the time of partition, Poles had strong cultural tradition and literature. Suppressing such language and culture is difficult or impossible. You say children were educated in German". I am sure they were educated also in Polish, even if this happened at home. Certainly there were many well educated Poles by 1918, and overwhelming majority could speak read and write Polish. Similar things happened in the Russian-annexed territory, which was the largest part of Poland. Russian policies varied with time, but there were times when formal education in that part of Poland was available only in Russian. I can compare this with other nations whole langiuage was suppressed. Ukrainian language was never recognized in the Russian empire as a language, no official education was available, and at various time publishing books in it was prohibited, not even mentioning newspapers. Unlike Polish language and culture which are quite old, Ukrainian literature begins only AFTER Russian annexation, though most people spoke Ukrainian. So many books were published abroad and illegally brought to the empire. Even under such circumstances, by 1918 there were many people who not only spoke but read and wrote Ukrainian. EDIT. I agree that the mass of peasants did not have a high literacy rate. The same applies to Russia and Ukraine where most peasants were illiterate; Poland was somewhere in between Russia/Ukraine and countries to the West of it. However for the survival of literary tradition, a critical mass of intellectual is crucial, and they can be a very small part of population. Intellectuals made a very small part of population in Russia as well, but they maintained a world-class literature. Polish literature had comparable status in 19th century if not higher, and nationalistic feelings were very strong both among the intellectuals and in the general population. 

In 1494, there was no newspapers, no internet and no Netherlands. The "new world" at that time meant just a couple of islands about which population of England and France knew nothing. Neither they knew or cared about the treaty. So probably they did not react in any way on this treaty. Later, as more was discovered, and some countries expanded their overseas activity, and started to compete with Spain and Portugal, they did not recognize the treaty. Probably the most important consequence of this treaty was that Brasil (discovered only in 1500) became Portuguese. 

Yes, Trotsky and Trotskysm was always strongly condemned and criticized in Soviet Union while Soviet Union existed. The history of Communist party was a mandatory subject on all levels of education, and large part of it was criticism of Trotskysm. This also applies to all other Stalin's enemies in the party, leaders of the opposition, like Kamenev and Zinoviev and Bucharin. These people were never formally rehabilitated, until the "perestroika" in the late 1980-s, when only Bucharin was rehabilitated. Some other victims of Stalin like the military commanders were rehabilitated in Khrushchev time. Mass terror was condemned (to some extent) but Stalin's struggle with rivals inside the party was not. I do not give references (which can be easily found). Consider this as a first hand account:-) EDIT. Comments below show that Buharin, Kamenev and Zinoviev were rehabilitated in the late 1980-s (during the "perestroika") but Trotsky was not. 

On my opinion, Wikipedia gives a satisfactory description of the current state of knowledge about this question. On the place which Schliemann excavated there are 11 or 12 layers of ancient cities which existed in various historical periods. One of these layers is roughly of the same time which is traditionally thought as the time of the Troyan war described in Homer's poems. (The dating of this Troyan war was established by Hellenistic scholars as 12 century BC). It is not the same layer that Schliemann thought, so in the process of his non-professional excavation he actually destroyed the most interesting (from the point of view of correspondence to the Iliad) layer. In Hittite texts of the same epoch there are some personal and geographical names which resemble somewhat the names mentioned in the Iliad. There is some research showing that geography and geology of the neighborhood of the excavated city fits the descriptions in the Iliad. This is a condensed statement of what is known now. $URL$ A very comprehensive source for the recent research and the current state of knowledge is Joachim Latacz, Troy and Homer, English translation by Oxford University Press, 2001. It addresses exactly the question you asked: what is the relation between ruins in Hisarlik and Homer's Iliad. He concludes that there is a lot of evidence but there is no conclusive proof that the war described by Homer ever happened. No inscription was ever found in Hisarlik, saying "This is Troy" or "Agamemnon was here" :-) Another good reference is Eric. H. Cline, 1177 BC. The year civilization collapsed. Princeton university press, 2014. EDIT. Another question is why Schliemann started his excavations in this particular place. He relied on research of Frank Calvert who studied all evidence available to him. Ancient Greeks of classical epoch "knew" where Troy was. At the time of Alexander the Great there was a temple there dedicated to Achilles, which Alexander visited soon after his landing in Asia. These are already historical times, and existing evidence permits to trace Alexanders itinerary. Calvert was based on this sort of evidence, besides Homer himself. 

Some of the land-lease things were of course consumed. Some things were returned. The following is based on an eyewitness account that I've heard in my youth. The person who told me this was a truck driver in 1945, driving a Studebaker truck. Few months after the war ended, he was told that the truck is to be returned to the US, and it must be in an ideal condition. They spent weeks on repair, and in the end the truck was like new. Then they drove it to Vladivostok, where they were supposed to be loaded to the US ships. He described an enormous line of many thousand trucks (all looked like new). Then he described their surprise: all these wonderful trucks went under press. The press made a little compact piece of metal of each truck, and these pieces were loaded to the ship! Considering smaller items, I remember I possessed two: a military flask made of aluminium, and stamped "US Army" and a wool sweater, of exceptional quality which I inherited from my mother. According to my mother, this sweater came in a parcel with American help, probably not a part of land-lease, just a private help. On machine tools. Probably they constituted a very small portion of the US help. When visiting factories in 1960s I've seen a lot of German machinery, and nobody cared to remove labels. But no US machinery.Most of land-lease help consisted of ready, final products. 

Yes, they did. They argued that their conquests bring benefits of peace, civilization and prosperity to the conquered lands. This point of view was expressed not only by native Roman writers (like Cicero) but also by some writers from the conquered nations (Polybius, for example). In the case of Greece, they certainly did not bring civilization to Greece, just the opposite happened. But they brought peace. The whole history of ancient Greece is the history of continuous cruel warfare between the city-states. And all attempts to stop it and unite the Greek states before the Roman conquest failed. Writers of that time perfectly understood that "Greek freedom is essentially the freedom to make war on each other", I don't remember which (Greek) writer said that. The same argument was used by some British empire builders (The "burden of white man" as Kipling called it). Some modern scientists agree with this argument, for example: Ian Morris, War! What is it good for?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization from Primates to Robots, 2014. EDIT. I do not say anything about the plausibility of this argument, but this was not asked. In some cases indeed it looks like Roman conquest brought peace (Greece). In other cases it led to complete destruction of the conquered society (Carthage).
