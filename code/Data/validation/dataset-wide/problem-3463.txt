Your get the basic intuition, but real-life situation is a little bit different. First, I didn't really understand what you meant by "try to catch some 'fool'", but what you are calling foreign exchange bank is actually called the Foreign Exchange (market), and consist of buyers and sellers that are basically ready to buy and sell any currencies (almost all currencies in fact) provided that the price is align with their expectations. Classic laws of market apply to this market, and if the government of country X (its central bank to be more precise) print a lot of money, it corresponds to an increase in the the supply. The result, as you might expect, is a decrease in the price of money relative to other money, which is the exchange rate. Money may be hard to understand, but it is actually a right to future cash flow of a given country. It is a sort of perpetual debt with zero coupon issued by a given country. So, if the country issues more money, it means that it issues more debt, so as a dilution mechanism it yields less cash flow to each unit of money, and since the price of money (as the price of any debt) is the expectation of future cash flow, the price will decrease. Then, this will indeed results in more inflation. I expose two ways of seeing that. First, you can think about the price of goods as the price of goods relative to the price of money. Indeed, you're going to pay $x$ for a particular good because the seller knows that it will receive $x$ and that $x$ will give him the right to a certain amount of GDP (cash flow of country). But if the amount of GDP that the money represents is lower, he will ask for a higher price. Second, traditional monetary research has derived, a long time ago, the following formula which represents what I explained in my first point, but more formally. The following is always true, it is an accounting relation : \begin{equation} M\cdot V = P\cdot Q \end{equation} $M$ is the amount of money, $V$ is the speed of money, $P$ is the price level and $Q$ is the output or quantity of goods exchanged. Without entering into too much details on this equation (there are extended information on Internet), you can see that increasing $M$, holding $V$ and $Q$ constant, results in inflation. To come back to your question, country does not (only) print money to repay their debt, because they are afraid of inflation. There is a big debate on inflation (I'm sure you can read a lot of stuff on Internet also), but loosely speaking inflation seems hard to contain. So to avoid hyper-inflation situation, they try to maintain inflation (in general below 2%). Your story does not need another company investing in country X because, as you said people will end-up with more money, but production of country X will effectively increase. But it is true that companies buy currencies for investment purpose in the country. Even local company may end-up buy their own currency if for instance they sell product in USA (exportations), and sell the USD they received against buying their own currency. This is why importation and exportation (worldwide) is a good indicator for fluctuations in exchange rates. Printing money to pay debt is a complicated question, and I only tried to sketch up some insight here. For more information, read more on money creation and inflation (either in the academic literature or in economic textbook for instance). 

I guess the question is : which asset would yield the higher risk premium or expected return? Risk premium depends indeed on the intrinsic characteristics of the asset, and on the pricing kernel, in particular the covariance between the pricing kernel (which is proportional to marginal utility) and the asset return. Therefor the risk premium will depend on the utility function you specify. But the general idea is that an asset that pays high when consumption is high will have a lower price and then a higher return to compensate for that risk. Under complete market, the general formula is : \begin{equation} E(R^{e}_{t+1}) = -R_f\cdot cov(m, R^e_{t+1}) \end{equation} where $R^e_{t+1}$ is the excess return, $R_f$ the risk-free rate, and $m$ the stochastic discount factor. $m$ will depend on the utility you specify but will be proportional to the marginal utility. Because of the (generally assumed) concavity of utility function, $m$ will be low when consumption is high and high when consumption is low. In your example, the expected excess return of asset B would be 0, otherwise stated the expected return of asset B would be the risk-free rate because its return is uncorrelated with consumption. Asset A pays high when consumption is low, so when marginal utility is high, so the risk premium will be lower than the risk-free rate. The main idea is that since this asset can be use as insurance against variation in consumption, agents will want to hold it, so its price will be higher and then its return lower. So you were almost right, asset A will have a higher price than B, but a lower expected return. 

Prices changing so frequently is simply the result of an adjustment between demand and supply in the market. Demand and supply change all the time, because market venues allow them to change very frequently, and so does the prices. This does not mean that the fundamentals of the underlying assets are also changing, this is just the way market process (what it perceives as) new information. Say the price of a stock is $x_0$ and I'm about to buy 1,000 units of that stock. Effectively, I will buy those 1,000 units at a price $x_1>x_0$ because at a given point in time demand increases so the price adjusts. However, if there is no new information, it's likely that somebody else would want to sell 1,000 units after that, and then the price would adjust downward at $x_2<x_1$. Note that we do not necessarily have $x_1=x_0$ though. It depends on much more factors that in my simple example, but the idea is there. The price changing a lot, also means that you, as an investor, are able to buy/sell at any point in time. If, as you said, prices were updated once a day, that means that you would be able to make a transaction only once a day. Actually this exists on some market, and in general the price is set through an auction process. But obviously, if possible you want to be able to buy/sell at the moment you take the decision, and in general you would dislike to wait until the daily batch processed. Regarding, the high frequency that the most liquid markets have reached now, this is the result of the competition between market venues. Indeed, in current days, there are often several places where you can buy/sell a particular stock for instance. Since market venues are seeking to attract the largest possible amount of transaction on their market, for liquidity reasons, this results in market competing on the frequency they offer to market participants. Actually, this is a bit more complicated, let me just sketch up some words. Algorithmic traders are the type of market participants that provide a lot of liquidity because their are able to buy/sell extremely fast, there are the new market makers in a sense. The people who set up those algorithms (large banks mostly) are also seeking for profit. They know that high-frequency will make them more efficient than classic human investor, so they are looking for the fastest possible way to make transaction on a market. And market platforms, wanted to attract those liquidity traders (the algorithmic traders), have increased (a lot) the frequency of their market. This is not necessarily bad, actually if you buy/sell something on a exchange-market, it's likely that your counterparty will be an algorithm. The question of whether it's efficient or not, especially in time of crisis, is more opinion-based and there are some research on that issue.
