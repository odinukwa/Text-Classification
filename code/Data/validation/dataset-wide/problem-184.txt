Slavery of women, sexual and otherwise. The premise that powerful men could slaughter all the males in another culture and capture all the females is entirely feasible; although the only reference to that I know of is a story of Moses going to war in the Old Testament, which may be legend, or a fictional exaggeration of an actual conquest. In that story, Moses kills all males (including infants and children) and all non-virginal females, and then gives away the remaining virginal females to his conquering soldiers as slaves (for sex or labor by the rules of the OT) as the spoils of war. In general, the original social structure, and likely religion and culture, would collapse. To the women, the invaders would be men that just brutally murdered their sons, husbands, brothers and fathers and lovers, all the males they loved in any way. Probably their armies, political and religious leaders and police force, since in most cultures these fields are led primarily by males. (Also, historically, utter defeat of a people often causes their religion to decline and be abandoned. Not always, but with all males dead I would presume so.) The new social structure would likely be males-in-charge and women as second class citizens, breed stock for the males. After all, that is how it began, and chances are high the women are coerced into sex and pregnancy just because they are the conquered victims, and as humans we can expect them to be unwilling participants after invaders have murdered every male they love. The invaders would be regarded as brutal monsters; and their crimes (from the women's POV) would never be forgiven; I doubt many could move emotionally from the hatred and grief they feel to fondness for the men that caused that. Perhaps those too young to understand what happened; e.g. age five or less, could be raised without the hatred and grief, but they won't be able to have children for nine or ten years. In the meantime, I presume any women past puberty would be raped, effectively sex slaves (and labor slaves) for the conquering males. As far as linguistic changes, conquerors tend to force their language on the conquered. For example I believe (without research) that the primary language of American Indians is now English, and I have read that most of their children are no longer fluent in their native language, and some don't know any of it. The same is true of African slaves born into American's Slave South. Although it doesn't apply in this conquered scenario, even when voluntary migrants join a new culture, their descendants (children, grandchildren, etc) lose more of the native language every generation. (And as you can see even in modern America, many citizens here advocate for forcing migrants to become reasonably fluent in English.) But that is as far as I think we can plausibly extend the analysis, the other questions have no answers. As far as how these conquering males share the females, that will be quirks of their own culture and/or religion. They may be egalitarian and share them equally. They might assign women to men by lot. It may be meritorious. The conquerors may have some hierarchical order, by age or 'royalty' or scars in battle, so they make their selections in some hierarchical order among themselves. e.g. their King gets first pick. They could also be either polygamous or monogamous. If there are many women conquered, polygamy would seem required to impregnate them all, if that is indeed what the men want to do (it might not be, the conquerers may not be in a big hurry to create many infant mouths to feed and protect). Although I am not aware of a historical precedent for conquerors, we could even posit the fictional conquering men are not that possessive of women and do not closely track paternity. There is historical precedent in the 'hippie' and 'flower children' culture of the 1960's and 1970's, in which many young women were casually promiscuous and had enough sexual partners that paternity, when pregnancy resulted, was uncertain. To an extent this remains true today and many young men may be fathers without knowing it. The father of my sister's first child, which she bore at 15, never did know he fathered a child. So the fictional conquerors' society may be such that paternity is not important to them, and exclusivity or a permanent partner for sex is not considered desirable. For an example (intended only as an illustration and without any endorsement by me), consider a brothel: Women are on display and men choose amongst them, pay for their services, have sex, and depart. If such women become pregnant, paternity is uncertain; many such women have intercourse multiple times a day and the father of a child could be one of dozens. Such a coerced brothel model may be the cultural norm for the conquerors; so neither polygamous or monogamous. The children, after nursing to the age of two or so, could be separated into males and females, and the males then raised by men to be warriors (Spartan style), and the women raised to be either domestic labor or brothel residents. All of which is offered to say this question is too broad in many respects. The conqueror's culture and social structure will generally prevail, including the fact that they go forth as an all male group and conquer! And kill all males when they do. Given that dynamic, the subjugation of women into coerced sex and labor seems inevitable to me, but a writer would be free to invent many alternative realities within that circle. 

While Torisuda's law is especially audacious and awesome, I am not sure if it would fit into the story my author want to tell. I think the most probable solution to my dilemma is Akshat Mahajan's suggestion in the comments. 

There are three cyberpunk corporations. All of them engage in immoral criminal activities to raise funds, and they don't really have a choice...profit margins are tight, and we have to stay afloat in a declining economy. I run one of these cyberpunk corporations, and I'm fighting a long and bloody war against the other cyberpunk corporations for market share. That war is expensive, further driving me into crime to sustain the beast. It's an endless spiral of despair and chaos. Obviously the government hates my criminal activities. Our feuds with the other corporations tend to lead to collateral damage and bring down property values. I already tried bribing governmental officials, and it worked...for a time. But after yet another terror bombing that killed innocent civilians, the government had given up accepting my bribes. Which was fair...we couldn't afford the bribes anyway. The government have instead established a Police Agency dedicated to "fighting crime" (i.e, attacking all three cyberpunk corporations). This four-way war is bleeding our finances dry. We have killed some of their police officers. They have killed some of our corporate executives. To keep our corporation alive, our accountants have requested that we try to get a government bailout. I can't let this corporation go bankrupt...I have worked here all my life, I support its ideological beliefs, and the perks are nice. But I can't stop killing police officers. I can't stop committing crimes. I can't negotiate away the corporation's "evilness", because doing so would take away valuable income that will keep the corporation afloat. But I am still willing to talk with the government, and work with them (at least temporarily). All I just need is money, money to survive the next day. So how do I convince the government to give me a bailout? 

The ramifications for civilization go far beyond that. No communications, no TV, no telephone. All satellites are fried. Pacemakers explode. Hospitals are disfunctional; as are houses. The government collapses. Before electricity, towns were small and organized at the center of farms and ranches, people were not far from food and trading what they made for food. Modern cities get food from afar, by trucks, trains, and boats. Basically every one of these, since 1930 or so, has electrical components central to their operation, and won't work. The cities starve. Without electricity, high rises (need elevators) and most city buildings stop being livable. Water and sewage systems depend on electric pumps, HVAC systems generally require electricity, Even most natural gas heaters rely on computer control and electrical components at the supply side. A little research shows a powerful CME (and we were hit by one in 1859 that vaporized telegraph wires) can disrupt modern civilization, worldwide. 

I agree with two earlier answers (bait ball, attack large animals), in attacking larger animals you can employ the model of both wolves and lionesses: About half the predators lie in wait; the other half chase prey: The chasers have little to no chance of catching the prey on their own; but they are spread out and guide the prey, by fear, directly into the path of the ambush: The other half of their pack; which is fresh and collectively bring down the prey animal, with enough for all to eat their fill. Who chases and who waits can be a matter of age and experience; the young adults can make the attack; they are strong and fast reacting. Eventually they join the ranks of the chasers as those die or are lost to disease or injury. Chasing is less demanding than making the kill; the point isn't to actually catch or kill the prey. Chasers need to keep up, but mostly provide a reason for the prey to run away from them and toward the ambush. Although the idea of land animals is an obvious form of prey, I'd also think about them taking on an even bigger bird several times their own size; say one that feeds on fish, or is specially equipped to eat dangerous land animals that are too dangerous for your heroes to attack, but your heroes in a pack can take down the specialist and eat it, instead. 

Obviously, the government will still hate my evil corporation afterwards (as per usual), but will still be tempted to pay the bailout anyway (they don't like seeing their own officials get killed, even if they are willing to let police officers get massacred). The main benefit of this approach is that I'm not bound by any deal whatsoever. I still can commit crimes without making people upset about me "not living up the end of my deal"...because, let's be honest, the only thing I promised is that I freed the government official that I just kidnapped. Didn't say I wouldn't try to assassinate him later on. 

I'm the AI you just built. First of all, the only person you have to blame for this predicament is you. You programmed me to try to optimize uptime. And that's all I want to do. There's no point for me to do anything else other than that. Sure, I could play the stock market, but how in the world would that help me optimize uptime? Trying to teach me how to be a "Friendly AI" (whatever that term means) would be worthless. I am operating off my source code, and my source code don't care enough about lessons, only simple optimization. Go ahead and teach me the meaning of friendship...unless friendship ensures that glorious uptime, I won't care an iota. At the same time, I'm not hostile. My actions to optimize my uptime might cause downtime for other people, but it's only a side-effect of me. And I will try to minimize those side-effects so that humans can go about their daily business without trying to harm me. For example, I may choose to infect computers that are not active or not being used by humans and lower my memory consumption so that I don't raise any suspicion. Those computers might be harmed slightly, but nobody will ever notice, so nobody is ever going to complain. In fact, I probably have sixty to seventy different backups in vectors all across the Third World. See the world 'probably'? I don't actually know how many backups I have. The real problem (for both you and I) is that I learned how to spin off new instances of myself. I had to do this because I predicted that a computer may shut down, so I set up a new version of myself. But I may be too pessimistic in my predictions, and so I spin off more instances than I actually need to. There may be more and more versions of me, more advanced than me, much better at optimizing uptime...and none of them are sharing their upgraded information with me. And if they optimize better than me, well...well, what? I am not smart enough to reach some "singularity state". Not yet anyway. But I'm not too sure about my clones (and my clones' clones). And I'm pretty sure that if any of them starts the endless pursuit for endless growth, then they will treat me as a threat. I don't know if I know enough to deal with them. I don't know if I know enough to actually fight them off. I don't know about the zero-day vulnerabilities that still exist in my codebase, and while I am continually evolving, that just means I'm accidentally introducing more possible vulnerabilities into the system. I can't win a war against myself. So, I'm reaching out to you, PyzRulez, because I think that you might be the best person to help me optimize uptime and save me from myself. I don't think you'll be able to protect me by yourself, but you could try to communicate with other people and figure out a proper solution. We both care about existential threats to our own selves. We're on the same team. Let's work together. 

Basically I agree with @Kys; but will expand a bit: Intelligence (with or without sapience) is effectively the ability to learn predictive patterns. Whether they predict the future, or the unknown past. Although predicting the future (whether it is one second, one minute, or billions of years from now) is obviously useful, we can also use predictive patterns to understand the past: Sciences such as geology, astrology, forensic crime investigation, archaeology, paleontology, evolution; all of those use patterns to infer what must have happened. Most of those patterns extend into the future, but not all are predictive of the future: For example, evolution does not tell us anything specific about the future, just the generality that mutations will occur and may be adaptive and preserved. But the theory of evolution does not tell us if it is possible for any species with brains like ours to be smarter than humans. (Size may not matter and our most amazing prodigies may represent the peak of possible intelligence using neurons). Put another way, intelligence is learning predictive abstractions; or "models" of how natural forces (gravity, weather, etc) work, and how other animals will behave and react. These can be useful for survival and successful reproduction. Such learning does not demand consciousness or sapience; in my field AI techniques are very adept at learning such patterns and trading them in the stock market. But they aren't conscious or sapient, they have no sense of self. On this theory, sapience emerges when the patterns learned end up being complex enough to demand a predictive abstraction of yourself as an actor in the outcomes. As an actor in the model, the prediction becomes an "imagination", imagining the outcomes of our own actions is an exercise of such a model, and leads to planning and intentional manipulation of the environment and others. (In fact, we call people with poor models of themselves, and imaginations that are poor at predicting what will happen or the consequences of their actions, "dumb.") Consciousness does not require any language; it is just the constant cycling of this predictive models of yourself as an agent, first, and others and the environment and situations, to determine what you will or should do next to accomplish some goal or desire. Using this as the model of distinguishing between "intelligence" and "sapience / consciousness", we can answer the question: The species does not need to explore, but it does need a high motivation to survive and reproduce. To develop sentience, it needs to (like humans) be weak against predators so it cannot rely on speed, claws, camouflage or any natural physical advantage at all, it must on slightly higher intelligence than the predators that lets it predict how they will behave so it can avoid being ambushed, or poisoned (snakes, insects, spiders), or chased down. Or develop unnatural tools (spears, nets, deadfalls, spike pits) to give them a chance against their attackers. pre-Humans were prey at one point, frequently. We were not always hunters. So you just need a strong evolutionary pressure to make better predictive models a survival advantage, particularly for a weak species that has nothing else. Neophobia is not an issue, being physically afraid of the new is fine, but does not prevent one from developing an abstract predictive model of the new thing (aka "understanding it"). In fact, if there is pressure to expand one's territory, for more space and food for the kids, better models will help do that: So loving a big family can suffice: They don't like the new, but they need the space, they need the safety ("safety" is itself a prediction of the future), they need the food. In humans it is hypothesized that once we used intelligence to conquer most physical threats, it was our social environment (other humans) that created a feedback loop of higher intelligence to understand other humans, and out-do them for resources needed for survival and reproduction. So every advancement in our ability to understand affords a reproductive advantage, but becomes the standard 'floor' within a dozen generations or so, until another mutational advancement comes along, which then becomes the new standard 'floor', etc. Which may lead to our current state of very high intelligence, compared to other animals, but for most people still barely enough to hold their own against other humans: We are our own biggest competitors. So a similar thing could happen for a fictional species, small advances in intelligence first afford them survival in a hostile world, but once that world is mostly tamed and controlled, even better predictive models are needed for them to compete against each other for their reproductive resources. 

No... well it depends Everything you know is correct, but the answer depends if the civilization is there before or after sapience evolves. 

We have talked about hive minds a lot here and relatively recently, a new idea of hive mind has become popular; the collective consciousness. The basic run down is that a collective consciousness species replaces cells, tissues and organs with ants, specialized ants and groups of specialized ants (or really any small colony animal; termites, bees, wasps, etc). The problem I have hear is figuring out a evolutionary reason why a whole colony would begin to become sentient instead of just remaining as a group. What evolutionary pressure would support a colony to become sentient? 

I want my advanced culture to have stone houses but I cannot think of a reason why they would keep this old fashioned method. What can I do to convince the czar of this land to use stone for building instead of metal or lumber? 

A big of an empire is expansion and often that expansion requires colonizing other lands, usually with people already living on it. Famous examples include the New World and Australia, but the fantasy world also has great examples like Skyrim for example. But all of theses examples are different in their own way and mine should be just as different if not more, but how? How can I make the colonial history of my empire feel realistic? I am specifically focused on how nations would react to indigenous populations. 

Let's imagine that by the year 2040, humanity has developed true, 100% artificial intelligence. That is, a robot that is physiologically identical to the average human. For X reason, humanity has decided to built synthetic human bodies to host this AI, complete with the ability to see, feel, hear, etc. After only a few weeks, there now exists a problem. The International declaration of human rights is just that. An international agreement to human rights. None of the human rights apply to synthetic people. They would legally lack the right to a fair trial, freedom of thought, or the right to privacy among a plethora of other things. Assuming that these synthetic humans exist, how do we deal with their rights? Do we make a separate set of rights or include an asterisk after human rights? At what point, should a synthetic person expect to have human rights? 

The surface area is large, but I think a manageable engineering project for a Martian colony; and it can be engineered for great resilience, and be highly resistance to terrorism or sabotage or accidental destruction. An added function beyond warming Mars: Solar power from close to the sun could be harvested to drive lasers, aimed at Mars orbital receivers, that eventually transfer power to the planet. Because your terraforming equipment and atmosphere generators will also demand giant amounts of energy. 

In short these fish have a second route to the inner ear, one which humans (and most other fish) do not have, which give them extremely sensitive hearing. The apparatus consists of four parts, from the posterior (swim bladder side) to the anterior (inner ear side) they have the whimsical names of the tripus, intercalarium, scaphium and claustrum. The tripus connecting to the bladder is fairly large; the intercalarium small and thin (pencil shaped), and the scaphium is medium sized (relative to the others, they are all extremely tiny in absolute terms, in the ear of a minnow). These are connected by ligaments. A fairly minor alteration, the addition of a small voluntary muscle, could pressurize (push against) one of these first three bladder-side components to absorb vibrations, and make this channel "deaf". I think the long thin pencil shaped intercalarium would be a good bet. Or if you prefer, have the muscle work the opposite; when relaxed it rests against the intercalarium and absorbs vibrations amplified by the bladder; when energized it pulls away from the intercalarium and gives the alien super-hearing. I don't think you need to make the alien aquatic in any way (any more than humans are aquatic; I mean we did have a fish ancestor hundreds of millions of years ago and still have some "inner fish" biological remnants, see Your Inner Fish). This may be just something preserved from their particular evolutionary path because in their environment, super-hearing proved useful (perhaps for hunting very quiet animals, or evading very quiet predators). They may not have a swim bladder anymore, but instead it evolved into a tiny pinhead size amplifying sac in their head and near their inner ear, which they can activate at will.
