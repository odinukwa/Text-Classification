Firstly, yes, what you want is possible. The phrase you're looking for is "Fine Grained Password Policy" which allows you to configure password policies based on Global Security Group membership. Be warned, though, while it's not too complicated, it isn't a process that's as slick as other areas of Active Directory. I try and avoid posting blind links, but there's probably too much to put into an answer here so here is a walkthrough: $URL$ 

The two policies that are probably going to help you the most are in: User Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Explorer Hide these specified drives in My Computer Prevent access to drives from My Computer 

For a start, this computer will no longer have a trust relationship with the domain due to, well everything. Computer password will have expired, certificates will be wrong and so on. You'd be better rebuilding the server and importing your mailboxes I'd have thought. 

You can then use this wizard to automatically split your scope into two and create it on the other DHCP server. 

Yes, you don't have a DNS entry for firemnidochazka.cz. You need to add one using your DNS control panel (I guess that's the topic picture). It'll probably need an entry of "." or maybe an "@" symbol. 

Which version of Server 2008 R2 are you using? Hot-Add memory is only supported in Enterprise onwards. 

My forensics is a bit rusty, but I don't think this is going to be possible. File recovery programs work by scanning the hard drive at a low level for headers and footers of files. What it doesn't know (and can't know) is where that file sat in the file system. There is no "delete" flag - the easiest way to think of it is with the hard drive being a book and files being chapters. The Operating System has deleted all references from the Index and Table of Contents, deleted the chapter title and ripped the pages out. So while the text still exists, you can't know what the chapter was called or where it was in the book. Secondly, it's rule number 1 of data recovery that you never, ever, ever write to the drive you're recovering from. 

Different Windows editions support different amounts of RAM, for example: Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard: 32GB Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise: 2TB I'm curious about the impact, if any, of having more than 32GB of RAM on a Server 2008 R2 Standard box. Will performance suffer due to Windows having to manage more memory, despite not being able to utilise it? This question assumes that no physical or architecture limits are being hit. I.e., Windows is well aware that the machine has >32GB RAM, but only 32GB is usable. 

I'm Dan and I'm addicted to VDI. This answer can (and does) span several books, but let's give it a go: VDI is definitely in vogue, for sure, but remember - the basis of it isn't really new technology. Citrix Winframe started life on Windows NT and Citrix has been offering access to centralised Windows apps and desktops ever since. The ICA protocol is even older than that! In my opinion, the drivers haven't really changed a huge amount in that time - but what's achievable has. So, why centralise: 

And so on. With the "Administrator" account in particular, it could also be caused by a name clash betwen the local administrator account and the domain administrator account. Either way, this is all just part of Windows Profile Management (Or it's lack of, I guess you could say) and unless you're having a specific issue I'd just forget about it. 

They'll be encrypted on the hard drive, but not on Dropbox itself. So, very little, essentially. When the computer is running Dropbox will access the files exactly the same as it did before. 

As MichelZ, says, your manager is correct if you're on a 2003 domain. Though, regardless of that, I ideally wouldn't want to alter my policy for one single account, either. The real issue is that the service is attempting to log on with an incorrect password. I'm posting this as an answer because the solution is to stop the issue altogether and figure out why a service is attempting to log in with the wrong password. If it's due to the password expiring then this can be sorted in AD Users and Computers rather than by reconfiguring the password policy: 

You can use Group Policy Preferences to do this with absolutely no scripting. You can base the location on username, security group, client name/IP and a myriad of other options. Assuming you're on a 2008/2008R2 domain of course. 

This really depends on what the application is, the OS, and how (together) they manage resources and deal with load. It absolutely can be more beneficial to have several lower spec VM's than one high spec VM, but whether it's a 'good idea' for you simply depends. 

Ensure that NTP is functioning correctly on your domain and make sure you know which server(s) control the time. Ensure that all of your clients and servers are actually using NTP On your clients, reduce the MaxPollInterval and increase MaxPosPhaseCorrection. (This may help: $URL$ Make the change, allow everything to synchronise Reverse the client changes Now, because you did all of the above in a lab, try it in real life ;) 

If you're configuring a "Tagged" Network on XenServer, then this implies that it corresponds to a physical NIC which is plugged into a trunk port. Is this case? If the port on the switch is an access port with only a single VLAN, then you shouldn't be tagging anything on XenServer. Posting screenshots of your NIC and Networking pages from XenServer would be great, along with some more detail on your network topology. Also, there is no XenServer 6.5! 

Because your router is pretty much the definition of core infrastructure. Sure, you could build one but you'll lose out on: 

Why don't you just rebuild your server? Apart from as an "Emergency Get Out" I'd never trust restore modes etc on a Server Operating System.
