The tube might get a bit exposed, and the day-to-day rolling over the hole might wear it down until the tire eventually flats out. Chemical aggresion from road grime or mud could also be involved. The fabric of the tire might get damaged to the point there is a visible bulge. This not only causes a bump while rolling, but most importantly is a weak point that might lead to tire explosion and and accident. 

"Experienced and/or interested": Not for real world use. The regular spoked wheel is a very good and optimized solution to the "wheel" problem: light, stiff, low rolling resistance. The shown wheel is more of a curiosity, something to startle people. But, for sure, it is a good way to create potentially useful space "inside" the wheel... 

I would try below handlebar (possibly attached to the stem) and seatpost just below saddle nut. Stem would allow to turn quickly the handlebars after any non-falling-over evento so as to capture better evidence. Cushioning the clamp would certainly dicrease mechanical stress and improve sound quality. FOOTNOTES: I agree with some fellows that it might be too much trouble for possibly nothing, not to mention that leaving home with a conflicting mindset might make you nervous and more prone to accidents or discussions than to take proper care on the road ahead. Also, worrying if the camera is working or not is a time-consuming and distracting activity during the ride. But I totally agree with you that bike unfriendliness can be so extreme as to prompt this kind of attitude. I ride in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and we sometimes are exposed to so much unnecessary risk (neglect from speeding drivers, mostly), you become really frustrated. Some groups I participate have already made some progress by doing constant and intense pressure over traffic authorities and our city's major. On the long run, this is the only action that really pays itself off. Take care, and good luck! 

I had a rim with similar behaviour. Every tire was very easy to install and remove by hand on this rim, but it had a problem: while inflating, there were always a spot where the bead "tried to escape" from the rim, and I had to reseat everything by hand, cautiously, while slowly pumping more and more air. The final result was rideable, but quite unstable, and once during a race the tire bead popped at a certain spot, and I had to stop, lower the pressure, etc, losing precious time. There were no explosions, fortunately. In the end, the problem was a MANUFACTURING DEFECT: the total rim diameter was about 3mm smaller than it should, due to some quality control mistake. I gave up using that rim, and it now lies around, useless... I don't know if this is your problem, but maybe you could compare it side-by-side with other rims just to check it out. Hope this helps. 

As a physician myself, also a commuter and a guy who walks with computers, I would advise the following: 

From time to time, I soak it in water with a bit of glicerin soap ("neutral", recommended on manuals) disolved, in a bucket. I leave it a whole day submerged (have to put something heavy over the helmet, otherwise it floats out). My rationale is this: when you submerge, the natural diffusion process inside liquids makes the soap penetrate the sweat, and part of the sweat to disolve in the water. Soap has a natural tendency to suspend fat, and fatty acids released by skin are the hardest part to take away from the straps (the minerals, like salt, ammonia and the like, go away from diffusion even without soap). Also, these are consumed by bacteria and produce the stinky substances. After this process is done, I wash it by replacing the whole water many times, while diving it repeatedly and vigorously inside the bucket. Drying in a sunlit place (not necessarily direct sun) in a dry and windy day is ideal to kill the last bacteria and eliminate the last vestigial stinks. I have already disassembled the fittings through which the straps run, tied a thread to one of the straps ends, and pulled the straps out, leaving the thread behind. Washed the straps alone, and pulled them back using the thread. My conclusion: too much work, risk of not getting it right, and not so much better than the previously described procedure. Hope it helps. 

(just for the record, the wheel in the photo I posted is opposite to what I am advising. That is because I already bought it that way. And I think the missing spoke - broke yesterday - has to do with this lame inward-running pattern.) Hope this helps! 

The answer to "why alternate crossing spokes" is pretty much settled by the subtle suggestions from DanielHRicks and the direct and correct conclusions from the OP, in the very comments below the question. The two remaining questions would be: 

Wash bar and grip perfectly, with water and soap, to remove grease (even the grease from your hands). If the grip is new, probably not needed. Spill like a small spoon of alcohol inside the grip, and shake it inside a bit to make all the inner side of the grip wet with alcohol. Quickly (before the alcohol evaporates), insert the grip, twisting and pulling. In case it gets harder from the middle to the end of insertion, two strategies might help: 

There was a time when bikes (and cars, and food mixers, and whatever) were manufactured to last, and the same model would be manufactured and sold, unchanged, for many years. From somewhere in the 90's, there seems to be an obsession with the NEW, so now bikes (and cars, and cell phones, etc you get the picture) change their designs overnight, so people might want perhaps to purchase a NEW one every year. To make matters worse, in the world of bikes there has been a relative epidemics both from bikes manufactured in Asia (which might or might not be a Bad Thing, depending on perspective) and WalMart bikes (which are always Evil). So, if your bike is a "vintage" bmx, I think the best to do is to go to an oldschool BMX bike store and ask the shop crew. There are some bike models which are very distinctive (for example, the classic GT triple triangle), and folks used to see the same bikes over and over might remember some subtleties. But if your bike is very new, then I'd say it's nearly impossible. Sometimes bikes from two different brands are identical except for the logos, and sometimes bikes that are SUPPOSED to be identical are not, just for being from different batches. In the end, it matters most to know if your bike is GOOD (aka, real bike), or if it is just a Bicycle-Shaped Object, which I hope it is not. Hope this helps! 

Wikipedia ("Bicycle Gearing") and Google eventually led me to this: $URL$ and this: $URL$ (I would be afraid to put my money on these... ;o) 

Even if you HAD the instrument yourself, in your hands, It would be actually difficult to measure, annotate and manufacture the dimensions precisely. I think even if you take the original to a metal-machining shop, some precision would always be lost; There would be no way to be sure anyone of us measure it right, even if we were most interested in this reverse engineering process (I am, for sure, but I don't have the tool unfortunately). Most times, reverse engineering is a process where reproducing the WORKING PRINCIPLE of a tool is much more important than reproducing the EXACT DIMENSIONS of the tool. 

These look like normal wearing patterns of cycling shorts, unfortunately. My last 3 shorts (last five or six years) had to be put away because they became "transparent" right in the regions where they COULDN'T be transparent, even though they were still pretty much rideable. But it was very unconvenient to go inside convenience stores, for example. I noticed this has a lot to do with which parts undergo friction with the skin, and stretching/unstretching during regular use. I suspect some chemical reactions from sweat and other skin substances might be involved. Probably the washing procedure might influence the speed or visibility of the process. As a final observation, in general the highest the quality ones (as perceived at purchase time) tend to last much longer before the transparency effect ensues. Anyway, you probably need new shorts. Hope this helps. 

I think one possible issue is that you changed your stem. Drop bars are "supposed" to put you in a more aerodynamic position. From what I have seen, most drop bars go WAY front relative to the rest of the bike. That way, you have two forwarded positions (the safe ones), and one "resting", taller position that you sould use only when actually 'giving a break' to your body. Also, a longer stem adds more stability to the ride, because the weight of your torso, and the direction it is applied over the bars, tend to "self-center" the steering, thus reducing the perceived wobbliness of a narrower handlebar. I have assembled a flat-bar road bike recently, with a quite narrow (55cm) bar, and "by the numbers", I should use a 90mm stem. It was terribly wobbly, and everything felt much better after I switched to a 120mm stem: the added "frontal leverage" provided by my body weight over the more forwarded stem made the bike much more stable going over and around obstacles on the road. With a minor saddle foreaft adjustment, the bike became even more comfortable, too. At last, try to research (oldschool bike shop owners might be of some help) what's the philosophy of drop-bars positioning, because I am sure you are supposed to use each one of them preferrably in some specific moments of the ride (which I don't know by the way). Hope this helps!
