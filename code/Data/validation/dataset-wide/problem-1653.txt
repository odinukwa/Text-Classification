Cancer There is a study by Dr Ganmaa Davaasambuu et al at Harvard dated 2002 which links hormones in milk with increased risk of certain cancers. 

TL;DR; Tesla's Patents and notebooks are available. Tesla was often interviewed and gave public demonstrations. There's no convincing evidence that he had really discovered a means of transmitting power that could be commercially implemented in the way he envisaged in his "World System". There's no evidence (that I can find) which proves his system could achieve the 99.5% efficiency he claimed. 

None of the reports I've read quantify these effects. The severity of the effect obviously varies enormously depending on geographic location, time of year, weather conditions (cloud cover, smog, ambient temperature), orientation of vehicle, size, slope and composition of windscreen, material and age of dashboard, time left in the sun and so on. 

Fluorine is a pale yellow gas. It is highly reactive (e.g. water burns with a bright flame in fluorine). Consequently people generally don't come into contact with fluorine. 

So the species prevalent in Tehran is Rattus Rattus - the black rat, which is normally significantly smaller than the brown rat. A Google translation of the Persian language report doesn't reveal any suggestion that the rats were over ten times bigger than "normal" specimens in 2009. 

It isn't 100% clear but this account can be interpreted as meaning that phosophorus grenades were used in an anti-personnel role. The account doesn't identify the type of grenade, A more recent type is described as 

1930, from his book My Early Life. Which doesn't mean exactly the same thing but has a similar sentiment. In a speech in Parliament he also said, Of his predecessor Chamberlain who made the notorious Munich Agreement with Hitler and subsequently announced "peace for our time" 

From US Government Accountability Office - Food Additive Approval Process Followed for Aspartame The report contains information about notable dissenting opinions. It appears that from these, various well-known hoaxes and conspiracy theories have been constructed. 

One study suggests that for one species this is hypothetically possible. Reversing the Life Cycle: Medusae Transforming into Polyps and Cell Transdifferentiation in Turritopsis nutricula (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa). Stefano Piraino, Ferdinando Boero, Brigitte Aeschbach and Volker Schmid Biological Bulletin Vol. 190, No. 3 (Jun., 1996), pp. 302-312 

Overall conclusion Anyone, including Doctors, can treat animals in emergencies (subject to important provisos) Anyone, including Vets, can treat humans (with some important restrictions) 

The App description includes this disclaimer: "This application is intended for novelty purposes only." so it is clearly not intended to be taken seriously. 

In Chapter 8 p139‡ of "The Hut Six Story", Gordon Welchman describes some of the workers. One of the principle types of machine used was called the "Bombe". 

Vegetarianism Gandhi was a strict vegetarian, it seems unlikely he was in the habit of sprinkling sugar on his food. From his writings about the food of India it is clear that he had on occasion eaten end enjoyed sweets made with sugar 

However it seems very unlikely that a strict vegetarian, living mostly on uncooked vegetables, who (at least later in life) endured many long fasts, would have had any doubts that he could give up sugar for a week. Leading by example The Times of India tells a related story 

† This is the ISBN printed on the book I own. It is now associated with a different title by the same author. I don't know if it is the same book retitled. ‡ Page numbers refer to my UK (usually paperback) copy and may not apply to other printings in other countries. 

Update: Three years after the Fukushima disaster. The BBC reports that 33 cases of thyroid cancer have been confirmed in 260,000 children studied. The report does not make clear how many cases would have been expected normally. 

Lunar drawing by astronomer Thomas Harriot, possibly the first recorded observation using a telescope, dated 26 July 1609. (c) Lord Egremont. 1609 is not recent (using the word as might be expected by the general public). Also there are very old records of observations of the moon 

2) EPA The EPA provide information on Federally required emission control warranties which says that 

Update: I haven't found information on rates of mutations attributable to other causes of cancer but many credible organisations say that smoking accounts for around 90% of lung cancers in the UK. Cancer Research UK, BBC, MacMillan, BUPA. Here's an infographic from Cancer Research UK - it has a lot of information. 

No but census data is somewhat consistent with the notion that around 22% of Muslim women, born outside the UK, report themselves, or are reported, to the census as "cannot speak English well". The census figures relate, not to Muslim women as such but to UK women born in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Muslim Council of Britain seems to consider that the latter is representative of the former. 

A lot of people find paracetamol effective against pain and a microwaved bag of wheat an effective and low cost method of using heat to temporarily relieve pain. 

You cannot look at plugs in isolation, they are part of a system. In particular, BS1363 plugs are designed for use in UK electrical installations with wall-sockets that also meet compatible standards and are specifically designed for use with ring-mains circuits - which are standard in the UK but not used in almost all other countries. British plugs do seem to have a greater number of safety features compared to other national standards of similar age (e.g. US plugs). In the absence of reliable and properly comparable statistics, any assessment of their actual relative safety must be a matter of subjective opinion or a theoretical engineering assessment. 

Other Purple Penguin apps include "Zombie My Face". You should not conclude that zombies are present. 

The contents which remain after looting and the inscriptions in chambers in the old-kingdom pyramids in Egypt provide evidence of their purpose. "Wireless Electricity" Electricity is actually a rather vague notion but if we take it to mean the movement of charge carriers, wireless electricity would be what we experience in lightning or in the discharge of static electricity. This sort of electricity is much less useful to us than electricity conducted in wires. fine gold plating found on some ancient artifacts requires electricity There are methods for gold plating that do not require electricity 

So it seems that other medical experts do not share Professor Per Hall's alarm. The BMJ published several responses to this paper. For example, one containing 

There is no Jeffery Marlon Harris FRCS registered as a Fellow at the Royal College of Surgeons There is no county of Pembridgeshire in England or in the UK There is no University of Pembridgeshire in England (as Oddthinking observed in a comment to the question) The pineal gland produces melatonin. If you want extra melatonin in your bloodstream, you can eat plants that contain it, such as cherries. There is no need to use roundabout methods to stimulate your pineal gland. Any video containing these falsehoods has no credibility. 

Kalashnikov AK47 The subject of Spiegel article is the AK47 designed in 1947 and, as that article suggests, now considered somewhat obsolete and inaccurate. Calibre: 7.62 vs 5.56 The AK47 uses a 7.62×39mm round. Under US influence, NATO switched from 7.62x51mm to 5.56×45mm to reduce recoil and improve rates of fire. Recently this policy has been reversed somewhat as the 7.62 round is considered more effective in current conflicts. In other words, some US military units would prefer to go back to using the older heavier calibre that is effective at longer ranges. However there are a very large number of US and European made assault rifles that take the larger calibre ammunition - so this by itself is not a reason for using AK47s. US Elite Units US armed forces include a large number of units that have been described as elite. The Spiegel claim is therefore extremely vague. Navy Seals Navy Seals use a huge variety of assault weapons including 

Summary The essence of these reports seems to be that MRI scans do not normally produce heating in the vast majority of scans performed but that in very rare cases heating can occur either because of conductive implants or due to skin to skin contact or perhaps other circumstances. Conclusion Yes, in rare circumstances, MRI scans can produce uncomfortable heating or even burns. No, "exciting protons in the body" occurs during every MRI scan, "a sensation of extreme heat" does not and is rare. 

The origins may lie with Jacob ben Wolf Kranz of Dubno 1740-1804 - predating Albert Einstein 1879-1955 As described in One a Day, Bloch, 1987 

By definition, that's impossible to answer, we've also lost Newton's secrets and Edison's secrets. If any. But we know that Tesla's US patent 1119732 for Apparatus for transmitting electrical energy is on public record. Tesla wrote
