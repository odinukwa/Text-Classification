Just don't expect results, and expect a struggle, like I said, that hardened bend won't bend back easy, if you take the pole to a hardware store then you might find some plumber guy that'll be convinced he could get it straight for you. But don't be surprised after he breaks it or puts stretch fractures in it from trying. You can be surprised instead if he actually gets it straight and it doesn't bend right back the first time you try using it again. 

Same idea as the rollers, but made out of heavy duty material instead of metal, and you run the ropes trough a sleeve. 

After taking a look into it, it appears that the grizzly bears in North America are actually a sub species (ssp.) of European brown bear. (Recently extinct California Grizzly) U. a. gyas (Peninsular Grizzly) U. a. horribilis (Mainland Grizzly) U. a. middendorffi (Kodiak bear) U. a. nelsoni (Mexican Grizzly) 

After googling, "wash clothes in a bag" I discovered that there are actually special washboard bags that you can buy specifically for washing clothes while you're backpacking/traveling (see the Scrubba below). They provide instructions on their website on how to use the bag, but Im pretty confident that you could get similar results with any watertight roll-top bag using these modified instructions: 

You won't be able to get your pole back to what it was, but if you wanted to attempt to get your pole straight and see how much longer it lasts, my recommendation would be to use a pipe or tube straightener. 

Aluminum has a crystal structure and can be hardened using a process called "work hardening." Long story short, you've hardened your pole by causing dislocation movements in the crystal structure of the aluminum. If you compare your bent pole to your other poles, you'll notice that it doesn't flex as much as it used to, that is because it is now a harder alloy than the rest. Any attempt to bend it back now that you've somewhat work-hardened it will cause fractures in the alloy. The only way to soften the aluminum is to anneal it, which involves heating the aluminum almost to it's melting point and then letting it cool slowly, but if you try to do that then your pole will be so soft that it won't flex, it'll just bend like welding wire. You would have to know how to re-harden the aluminum after you annealed it and bent it back, not a simple process, and not that cheap to get a metal worker to do it for you. You're best option is to either replace your pole, or deal with it being bent, unless you have a friend who is a millwright and knows how to anneal and harden alloys. Bent poles aren't that bad, I've been using bent poles in my MSR Hubba Hubba for years. Your pole is still strong, it's just not as straight and flexible as it used to be, annoying, but still functional. 

Think of a shovel, you use the sharp edge to cut into the snow, and the flat blade to pack it down. When you're climbing soft ice, you don't want to cut through it, you want it to support your foot so you can you stand on it. The horizontal front points are used for hiking glacial ice, snow and non-technical ice climbing. Vertical points are great for sticking into hard waterfall ice, but they will rip right through softer ice and snow like a knife. When hiking non-technical ice, horizontal points are the better choice. It's these style of crampons that all high altitude mountaineers wear when climbing mountains like Everest: I personally have a pair of both, but I've hiked on spring snow and ice with people who were wearing vertical front points, and have watched their feet rip through the ice in spots where my foot placements didn't move in my horizontal front point crampons. I've seen the same thing with people climbing wet waterfall ice even, especially if they only have one front point, they stick it into wet soft ice and it just shred right through it. I caught a fall because of this 2 weekends ago actually. 

It is possible to clean/repair your bag if it's not too far gone, but buying a new one will be easier, might even be cheaper, and will certainly be better. Options for cleaning slightly mildewy bags include using vinegar or bleach (bleach will likely discolour the bag) and hot water in the wash cycle. If washing the bag and tumble drying doesn't get rid of the smell then the only other option aside from consulting a professional cleaner that I know of its to inspect the down itself. Cut the threads along one of the seams in a spot where it would be easiest to repair, or where the smell is strongest, then pull out a good amount of the down and give it a look. If it looks bad, then it needs to be replaced. New down costs about $5-$10 per ounce depending on what loft you get. Considering that just about half the weight of your bag is down, you can guesstimate how much you would need. A 1kg bag would require about 18oz of down, so you're looking at about $90-$180 just to replace it, but you also have to make sure that the other materials of your bag aren't too affected, so wash the empty bag with bleach again before refilling it.

A kiwi coil is an alpine coil you manage and wear while still tied into the end of your rope. Tie in as you normally would while climbing or glacier walking, then coil as much rope as you want around your body. Tie off in the middle of the rope by passing a bight of rope through your belay loop and around the coil, finish it off by tying an overhand on a bight onto the rope leading to your partner (back up by clipping the tail end of your bight to your belay loop). If you tie it right, you can safely take a fall and all the force will go into your harness as if on the end of the rope. You can keep smaller coils (3-5m) in your hand too, tie a "magic knot" (slip knot) to hold in your hand as a handle between your hand coil and your partner, this helps you keep a better grip on the rope and coil, and in the event you need to drop the coil, the slip knot will come undone as soon as the rope goes taught. If you have a long rope, each climber can carry a kiwi coil, distributing the extra rope between the two of you. 

ALTERNATE METHODS 2 ATC Method Attach the release sling to your harness as is demonstrated in method 3, but instead of using an autoblock, use another ATC on your harness. With this set up, you can quickly put the belay end of the rope into the ATC on your harness when the climber gets to the top, then put your weight on the sling to fully release the autolocker and then simply lower the climber from the ATC on your harness. Petzl Method I like Black Diamond's method better, but Petzl demonstrates giving slack to the second by using a carabiner instead of a sling. This would be quicker than setting up the sling, and it may give you some leverage on the device which would make it a bit easier than yanking on a sling, but would still prove to be fatiguing on long or multiple lowers: 

Techniques for reducing water loss while hiking: Dress - In hot hot environments, you will actually retain water better by wearing long sleeve shirts and pants made out of light breathable materials. Also cover your head and neck. There are reasons why you don't see anyone in the Sahara riding camels wearing shorts and t-shirts, and the sun is only one of them. Hiking in shorts and t-shirts will keep you cooler, but so will hiking with a spritz bottle of ice water and a portable fan... Hiking in sweat-dampened clothing may not feel like it keeps you quite as cool, but keeping the sun off your skin will heat your body less, and you won't lose water into the air through evaporation quite as fast. Breathing - Close your mouth. Breathe through your nose. You're sinuses preform a function beyond producing excess amounts of mucous when you get a sniffle. At the very least exhale through your nose. Leaving your mouth wide open while you hike will dehydrate you just as fast a sweating. Move at a pace that your respiratory system can keep up with. Toileting - Hold it (if you can). Sometimes when people get moving, other things get moving too. You need to give your large intestine enough time for it to reclaim as much water as it can from your stool. Relieving yourself multiple times will also relieve you of extra water in your stool. In more desperate situations, try to soak up as much of that precious moisture as you can before discharging your bowels. Recycle... - In extremely desperate situations: 

The fletches (feathers) are indexed on the arrow so that when they pass the bow they will hopefully clear it completely without touching the shaft (see Slo-mo video). If you knock the arrow wrong (or worse, you build your arrow like a noob and put the fletches/knock on wrong), with the index vane towards the shaft, then not only will you most likely miss the target because your fletches are deflecting off the shaft, you also have a good chance of ripping the fletch clean off the arrow. I had to glue many a fletch back onto my fathers arrows using his big compound bow as a child. So index out, so you don't hit the shaft with the fletches, the index vane is often a different colour on pre-made arrows as Rory mentions, to make it easier to recognize if an arrow is knocked correctly. 

I have a 17.5' Clipper Tripper, and I live in Southern Alberta, which means I sometimes get caught on the water in Chinook winds (90km gusts), I know what it feels like to get tossed around in the wind like a wind sock. Unless you have a heavy load to keep the bow down, or someone in the bow that can help you out, your best option is to paddle the canoe backwards. You can sit where you are and back paddle if you just need the extra control for a short distance, but if you're fighting big gusts, sustained winds or strong currents, your best option is to turn around in your seat, and start paddling into the wind/current like you're steering from the bow. This way the part of your canoe getting blown around will act like a rudder instead of a sail. 

I've been looking at big wall harnesses and I've been noticing that a lot of them come with two belay loops: 

It is never advisable to use any safety gear that you do not know the history of. Doesn't matter if it is legit, what matters is the history of the rope. If it's a club rope for climbing then there should be a record of usage and falls. If no record exists, then it is unknown whether the rope has taken any significant falls or if it is still safe to use. Larger diameter static ropes are a little more lenient than dynamic climbing ropes however. Odds are good your safety rope is at least 13mm in diametre. In which case a thorough inspection of the sheath for cuts or abrasion could be sufficient to pass the rope for rappels, I'd probably use it for myself for single rappels, but I'd never use it for rescue work. 

The most likely cause of death would be a crash landing. When geese come in for a landing after a long flight they are exhausted and look for lakes or ponds to land on because they can glide in onto the water and come to an easy stop without much effort. For geese to land on solid ground they have to slow their speed significantly and flap a bunch before touching down or they can seriously hurt themselves. One ice geese will tend to ski out the landings a bit because they know the ice is slippery, but they still slow themselves down quite a bit before touching down. It can be hard for geese sometimes to distinguish between a nice soft liquid lake, and frozen ice depending on the clarity of the ice when it freezes. Geese are not unaccustomed to landing on ice, but when they do they typically slow down more than they would when landing on water and ski out the landing. Tired geese are known to have rough landings every once and a while, even on water, but if they have one flying in on a frozen lake expecting it to be water, and land hard, it can sometimes result in injury, leading to death. This is the same reason why you'll occasionally find dead geese on football fields that have blue artificial turf. They mistake the turf for a lake and come in for a rough landing. So the most likely reason your goose is dead could be a crash landing, resulting in an injury that prevented the goose from escaping the freezing cold, which led to the goose's eventual death by exposure and freezing to the ice.
