He legally changed his name from to Metta World Peace in September 2011 (Wikipedia). After the 2013-14 NBA season, he played in China for a few months. When he first moved there, he announced that he would rename himself "The Panda's Friend" (CBS Sports). However, his name on his Chinese jersey remained Metta World Peace (or more precisely 慈世平, which is a three word/character abbreviation of his full Chinese name 慈善·世界和平). In March 2015 he moved to play in Italy. In this YouTube video of some his highlights while in Italy, I see that the name on his Italian jersey is "The Panda's Friend". However the commentators seem to call him "Metta World Peace". So, I do not know what his legal name actually is now. 

There aren't all that many international competitions, but since this rule was enacted in 2009, it didn't seem to stop the United States team from winning the 2010 FIBA World Championship. With winning, they withdrew from the 2011 FIBA World Cup, since they already qualified for the 2012 Olympics as a result of the 2010 championship and had little to gain. So being that there has only been one world class international competition, it's difficult to say. The US did win it though, so that would seem to indicate that it was not a significant factor. Whether there was an increase in travel calls, I wasn't able to find any reports on the matter. It's also a very small sample size. To really answer this question we will have to see what happens in London, keeping track of travels against the US versus other teams. 

This is done to show that they are a "Dead Eye" shooter from 3 point range. According to dictionary.com the term "Dead Eye" refers to "an expert marksman". The three fingers are held up to symbolize the three point basket that they just made and they look through the hole made by their thumb and forefinger to symbolize the "dead eye". As far as the high salute I'm not sure, however they will often slide their hand down their hip to symbolize holstering their "gun" that they used to make the "shot". 

This is definitely different for every sport, so I think it is hard to make a general statement. So, I will attempt to answer the question from the point-of-view of fantasy football and the NFL. There is evidence to show that it actually hurts ticket sales. In 2012, the NFL will require that teams show fantasy statistics at all stadiums. The belief is that fans are staying home to keep track of their fantasy football teams instead of buying tickets and attending games. Since ticket sales have been on the decline* for the past 5 years or so and subscriptions to services like NFL Red Zone and NFL Ticket are on the increase, it would stand to reason that the increase in popularity does not necessarily mean an increase in ticket sales. While this may be good for the NFL, it is not good for the individual clubs. It is worth noting that this impacts the NFL harder than other sports due to the fact that at least 50% of their games are played at 1:00PM ET on Sundays. So, if you are attending a game, you are likely missing out on the majority of other games going on that week. The impact may not be nearly as severe with fantasy baseball or fantasy basketball. *: warning- article is dated 2010, but the 2011 data was skewed due to the lockout and the 2012 data is not yet available 

I'm not sure if you can say that one strategy is better than another. I think the best thing you can do if you're concerned about this would be to watch a lot of tape on your opponents and see what they do most often and try to adapt your strategy to it. If they often send someone wide for a cheap pass then maybe you will want to widen or shift your wall to compensate or send an extra rover to handle them. If they often go for the top of the net then perhaps you will want to have your guys jump. I think it all depends on your analysis of your opponent which comes from playing them in the past and from watching a lot of film. 

When determining turnovers for a given player, how exactly are they determined? Wikipedia defines turnovers as 

However, I'm not clear on what happens on errant passes. When a player in possession of the ball makes a pass that is immediately intercepted by a defender, then obviously the player who passed the ball is charged with a turnover. My question is what happens if the ball is tipped by the player that the ball was intended for before the defender gains possession of the ball? Who is charged with a turnover in that situation, the player who made the pass or the player who tipped the ball before the defender gained possession? Is it determined by who touched the ball last or the player who last had full possession of the ball? 

I have only ever come across this 5-game series (1984 ECR1, NJN vs PHI, NJN win 3-2), where the road team won every game. Has this ever happened in a 7-game series? (In recent memory, one series in which the first 4 games were won by the road team was HOU vs DAL, 2005, WCR1. But the next 3 games were won by the home team.) 

The NBA is constantly tweaking the rules to make the game more entertaining, faster-paced, etc. So has the NBA ever considered reducing the 24-second shot clock (say by even one second)? 

Please see: $URL$ Greg Anthony (the commentator) is quite insistent that this should have been a jump ball. But it looks to me that the ball was not in Hibbert's "continuous possession" (as required by the rules, see below). Instead, it looks like Hibbert went up, Millsap blocked it, ball completely left Hibbert's hands, Hibbert rebounded the blocked shot (albeit while still in the air), and came back down with it (just like you would when getting any rebound). So this shouldn't be a jump ball (and the officials got it right with their no-call). Is my interpretation of the rules correct? 

There is evidence for fish feeling pain. Obviously you cannot simply say they do feel pain, only that we can observe behaviors that could be consistent with them feeling pain, and that they have the physical chemical receptors to facilitate a pain signal. A 2010 book by Victoria Braithwaite titled Do Fish Feel Pain argues that the "latest scientific evidence suggests that we should widen to fish the protection currently given to birds and mammals." I didn't buy the book, but this would suggest that her research indicates that they do. After all we wouldn't widen protection for animals that don't feel pain. Her 2002 article on the matter also suggests they have pain-like feelings.
