This is, of course, a very important problem. One (extreme) point of view is that any form of classical (=commutative) randomness reflects "only" human uncertainty and does not have an "objective" physical meaning. (Further answers to this question and more discussion are welcome on the posting entitled "Randomness in nature" on my blog "Combinatorics and More". Here is a link to a subsequent post with further discussion.) Some related material can be found in the site of the conference "The Probable and the Improbable: The Meaning and Role of Probability in Physics". 

There is a very important theorem by Procesi that derives all polynomial identities of the ring of matrices from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. For a review of rings with polynomial identities see this paper by Procesi. 

You can first introduce yourself. You may give the background to the question. Try to be clear and rather brief. 

$$(2/e) (1+o(1)) k2^{k/2} \le R(k+1, k+1) \leq k^{- C {\log k}/{\log \log k}} \textstyle \binom{2k}{k}.$$ Best lower and upper bound for diagonal Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number $R(k,\ell)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that any two-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on $n$ vertices $K_n$ by red and blue, there either is a red $K_k$ (namely, a complete graph on $k$ vertices all of whose edges are colored red), or a blue $K_{\ell}$. The lower bound is an improvement, by a constant factor, using the Lovasz local lemma, of Erdos' original 1947 lower bound. The upper bound is an improvement by a quasipolynomial (in $k$) factor of Erdos's bound by Conlon from 2006. (See this paper.) 

Let me try to put my 2 cents. Statistics is, of course, very important in social science research (and all other sciences as well). As for mathematical models, they also have become more central in many social sciences. A nice paper about Nash as a role model for mathematical modeling in economics is here $URL$ . If you want to get an impression of how a mathematical model in social science may look, here is (just as an example) a recent paper on contracts for providers of medical treatements $URL$ . The use of mathematical models is spreading and it is also controversial for various reasons. In many applications of mathematical models in social science, the model can be seen as a rhetoric tool and not as a computational tool. Regarding equality (and fairness that Joe mentioned,) this is certainly a central theme in several social sciences and other academic areas and there is a vast literature around it. 

Let me mention here Thompson's three questions: Question 1: Suppose that $G$ is the graph of a simple $d$-polytope with $n$ vertices. Suppose also that $n$ is even (this is automatic if $d$ is odd). Can we always properly color the edges of $G$ with $d$ colors? Question 2 : Let $G$ be a dual graph of a triangulation of the $(d-1)$-dimensional sphere. Suppose that $G$ has an even number of vertices. Is $G$ $d$-edge colorable? Question 3: Let $G$ be a dual graph of a triangulation of a $(d-1)$-dimensional manifold, $d \ge 4$. Suppose that $G$ has an even number of vertices. Is $G$ $d$-edge colorable? Questions 1 and 2 coincides (by Steinitz's theorem) for $d=3$ and are equivalent there to the 4CT. The starting point for these questions is a beautiful generalization for the 4CT proposed by Branko Grunbaum: Grunbaum's conjecture: The dual graph of a triangulation of every two-dimensional manifold is alwayas 3-edge colorable. Grunbaum's conjecture was disproved in 2009 by Martin Kochol. 

Dear Joe, As far as I remember all attempts to extend the midsphere theorem and the ball packing theorem for 4-polytopes turned out to be false. I remember discussing it with Oded Schramm and even very simple cases of Q2 like for stacked 4-polytopes or for pyramids over 3-polytopes did not work. Somehow the number of degrees of freedoms for the vertices of 4-polytopes or higher is not sufficient. (And even if you consider special cases where the number of degree of freedoms is fine still the theorems do not extend.) One possible extension I would be pleased to see is to realize generalized 5-polytopes so all 2-faces are tangent to a sphere, where these generalized gadgets each "edge" is not a steight line edge but you can bend it (say with 4 degrees of freedom). But as much as I will be pleased to see such a reasonable generalization formulated I would immediately guess it is false... 

The solution of the Kepler's conjecture by Hales deserves a special answer since it gives an important example both for a proof to a mathematical theorem massively using computers, and 15 years later by an impressive project for demonstrating a formal proof for the conjecture that could be automatically verified. The problem and the first project which in part was carried out by Hales with Ferguson is described in the Notices AMS paper "Cannonballs and Honeycombs" Another reference is a 2002 ICM survey A Computer Verification of the Kepler Conjecture. The published account of the second project - The Flyspeck project can be found in the paper A formal proof of the Kepler conjecture. For more information and links, see Hales homepage. 

The Question My question is for further introduction/explanation of Hairer's theory. 1) What are these tailor-made space-time functions? 2) What is the role of noise? 3) Can the amazing fact be described/explained in little more details? 4) In what ways, does the theory provides a rigorous mathematical framework for renaormalization and to physics' computations in quantum field theory. 5) How is Hairer's theory compared/related to other mathematical approaches for this issue. (Renormalization group, computations in quantum field theory, etc.) 

Five unrelated items: Mobius strip One of the best mathematical tricks is what happens when you cut a Mobius strip in the middle. (Look here) (And what happens when you cut it again, and when you cut it not in the middle.) This is truly mind boggling and magicians use it in their acts. And it reflects deep mathematics. Diaconis mind reading trick I also heard from Mark Gorseky this description of a mathematical based card game "Mark described a card trick of Diaconis where he takes a deck of cards, gives it to a person at the end of the room, lets this person “cut” the deck and replace the two parts, then asks many other people do the same and then asks people to take one card each from the deck. Next Diaconis is trying to read the mind of the five people with the last cards by asking them to concentrate on the cards they have. To help him a little against noise coming from other minds he asks those with black cards to step forward. Then he guesses the cards each of the five people have. Mark said that Diaconis likes to perform this magic with a crowd of magician since it violates the basic rule: “never let the cards out of your control”. This trick is performed (with a reduced deck of 32 cards) based on a simple linear feedback shift register. Since all the operations of cuting and pasting amount to cyclic permutations, the 5 red/black bits are enough to tell the cylic shift and no genuine mind reading is required." I think there is a paper by Goresky and Klapper about a version of this magic and relations to shift registers. The Link Illusion I heard a wonderful magic from Nahva De Shalit. You tie a string between the two hands of two people and link the two strings. The task is to get unlinked. This ties with what I heard from Eric Demaine about the main principle behined many puzzles (Some of which he manufectured with his father whan he was six!) Symmetry Illusion Sometimes things are not as symmetric as they may look. commutators-based magic (I heard this from Eric Demaine and from Shahar Mozes.) If we hang a picture (or boxing gloves) with one nail, once the nail falls so does the picture. If we use two nails then ordinarily if one nails falls the picture can still hangs there. Mathematics can come for the rescue for the following important task: use five nails so that if any one nail falls so does the picture. alt text $URL$ 

7. Maintaining a sense of tradition. Basing activities on areas with long tradition of success which are identified with the country's mathematical strength can be a successful and well excepted by the whole mathematical community. 8. Self-breeding can work The success of Israeli mathematical departments was largely based on successful self-breeding, namely absorbing as faculty member people who graduated at the department. 9. Self-confidence, Tolerance for "sporadic"(or non-main stream) areas (and tolerance in general) This seems to me a strength of Israeli mathematics and looks (to me) a good attitude especially for a peripheral and somewhat isolated place. Tolerance is important especially since mathematical quality is rather high dimensional (some dimensions being importance/depth/visibility/applicability/usefulness.) (There is also complete tolerance and essentially indifference in the context of mathematical life towards matters of politics, attitude towards religion, etc, issues that Israel is very torn apart about.) 10. Patience, realistic goals, unrealistic dreams Building a good mathematical activity takes time, and there are ups and downs as well. 

I agree with Noah that Papadimitrou's classification of several cannonical types of algoritmic proofs is very relevant to the question and to the understanding the computational complexity of mathematical existence proofs. Another interesting class is described by finding the sink in acyclic unique sink orientations (AUSO) of the didcrete n dimensional cube. Those are orientations of the discrete cube so that every face has a unique sink. There is an algorithm to find the sink in $exp (\sqrt n )$ steps. Another algorithmic proof whose complexity is unknown is Barany's proof of colored caratheodory theorem. 

$$\frac {1!~4!~7! \dots (3n-2)!}{n! (n+1)! (n+2)!\dots (2n-1)!}$$ This remarkable formula counts the number of alternating sign matrices of order $n$ as well as, monotone triangles, descending plane partitions whose parts do not exceed $n$, and various other important combinatorial entities. (See also this item on the online encyclopedia of integer sequences.) Alternating sign matrices are $n$ by $n$ matrices with entries $+1$ $-1$ and $0$ such that each row and column the non-zero entries alternate in signs, and first non zero entry is $+1$. They were defined by Mills, Robbins, and Rumsey who conjectured their number. The formula was first proved by Zeilberger. 

The MacWilliams identity $$W(C^\perp;x,y) = \frac{1}{\mid C \mid} W(C;y-x,y+x).$$ This identity connects the weight enumerator of a linear binary code $C$ with that of the dual code $C^\perp$. Here, $C$ is a linear subspace of $ \mathbb{F}_2^n$, $C^{\perp}$ is the dual space, and $W(C,x,y)$ is the weight enumerator defined as follows: Let $C_t$ be the number of code-words of weight $t$ (namely, vectors in $X$ with $t$ '1's), $$W(C;x,y)= \sum A_t x^t y^{n-t}.$$ The identity extends also to codes over other fields and to non-linear codes. It is very important in coding theory and has various other applications.
