Deep I'm not sure whether it has one meaning or zero. Either way, I think that it is deeply overused. 

One question is whether Eichler really did say it. One of the nice things about Google searches these days is that they let you trace the etymology of words, phrases, and aphorisms. I see a chain of references to this quote associated with Andrew Wiles and Fermat's Last Theorem. The chain seems to begin with a BBC interview in 1996 or 1997 in which Wiles says, "There's a saying attributed to Eichler that there are five fundamental operations of arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modular forms." On the other hand, this recent paper by Edixhoven, van der Geer, and Moonen calls the quote apocryphal. I can't trace what happened before that interview. Since the documented history of this quip currently begins there, we can start with what Wiles himself meant. The interviewer wanted to know what a modular form is, but that's not easy to explain on television. Obviously it was a facetious (and witty) answer. It was also part of a general point in the interview that modular forms are widely studied and seem fundamental. 

Part of $C_u(X)^*$ is well understood. Every uniformly continuous function on $X$ uniqely extends to the completion $\bar{X}$, so certainly any signed Borel measure on $\bar{X}$ is a continuous functional on $C_u(X)$. If $\bar{X}$ is compact, then you're done. Beyond that, I don't think that much can be said. For example, if $X = \mathbb{Z}$, then every bounded function on $X$ is uniformly continuous. So $C_u(\mathbb{Z})^*$ is the set of measures on the Stone-Cech compactification $\beta\mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$. It is well known that you cannot construct points in $\beta\mathbb{Z} \setminus \mathbb{Z}$ without the axiom of choice, or some other extension of ZF. That does not by itself imply that you cannot explicitly construct functionals in $C_u(\mathbb{Z})^*$ other than linear combinations of values, but I think that that's not possible either. Moreover, $C_u(\mathbb{Z})$ embeds as closed Banach subspace of $C_u(\mathbb{R})$, for instance by taking the piecewise linear extension of a bounded function on $\mathbb{Z}$. So there must be many non-obvious functionals in $C_u(\mathbb{R})^*$ that restrict to non-obvious functionals in $C_u(\mathbb{Z})^*$. This type of argument applies to lots of metric spaces. It applies to any metric space that has an unbounded uniformly continuous map to $\mathbb{R}$, which is to say, any unbounded metric space. In detail, let $X$ be an unbounded metric space with a base point $x$, and let $S$ be an infinite set of distances from $x$ to other points, such that any two elements of $S$ are at least 1 apart. Then a bounded function on $S$ extends to $\mathbb{R}$ by linear interpolation (and constant extrapolation below the minimum of $S$). Then this function $f(t)$ pulls back to the function $f(y) = f(d(x,y))$ on $X$. This is a closed embedding of $C_u(S)$ into $C_u(X)$, and $C_u(S)^* = C(S)^*$ is wild except for the functionals that are linear combinations of values on $S$. This is not a conclusive proof that $C_u(\mathbb{R})^*$ (say) does not have any non-obvious functionals in it whatsoever that can be constructed within ZF. But I would bet that this is true. 

First of all, MathOverflow gives you a great glimpse of how and when to ask mathematicians questions. This site has a fair mix of professors, postdocs, and graduate students, along with a few others. So as I think you can see, most mathematicians (maybe not quite all) like to answer questions. The only real issue is to write the question so that the recipient will enjoy answering it. Yes, you should introduce yourself and be polite. However, only in an efficient, common sense way. I for one really don't like toe-kissing and self-deprecation before a math question. It can be worse than rude, cryptic e-mail with no introduction. Here is an example of a turn-off introduction... 

I imagine that this is discussed better in some more recent textbook, but Google finds an old paper by Hangan with the same statement that the Grassmannian tangent bundle is a tensor product. The paper considers the geometric implications of having some tensor factorization of the tangent bundle of a manifold in general. I would guess that you can't describe the tangent bundle of a general Grassmannian in terms of line bundles. The line bundles yield a certain subgroup of the semigroup of possible total Chern classes. I would think that this subgroup misses the Chern classes of the relevant bundles by a mile. (But I don't know a rigorous argument or a reference.) 

There is a paper in JSTOR, The continuum random tree, I, by David Aldous, that is similar to your question. That is the first of a three part series of papers. However, it doesn't seem like Aldous' tree (or tree ensemble) can be the same as your tree. Your tree would have infinite valence everywhere, because the harmonic series diverges. 

I am teaching a combinatorics class in which I introduced the notion of a "mass formula". My terminology is inspired by the Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula for the total mass of positive-definite quadratic forms of a given size and genus. That famous mass formula is much too fancy of an example for my class. All that I really do is define the concept of the "mass" of a combinatorial object to be $1/|G|$ if $G$ is its automorphism group, and then argue that it can be easier to find the total mass of a collection of objects than to count them straight (using Polya counting theory). For example, the total mass of unlabeled trees of order $n$ is $n^{n-2}/n!$, because there are $n^{n-2}$ labeled trees. So I have two questions for which a quick answer (i.e. sooner than two weeks) would be most convenient: 

Okay, so that's what Lie groups are, now what about exponentiation. The most important formula for exponentiation is the "limit of compounded interest": $$\exp(A) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1+\frac{A}n\right)^{n}.$$ This formula can be approximated in an abstract Lie group (by approximating the base of the exponential to second order), so that exponentiation is well-defined in any abstract Lie group. (Or you can use the differential equation as algori says.) You can prove that this exponential satisfies the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula with a positive radius of convergence. If you wanted an infinite radius of convergence, then that does not happen and there certainly are issues about radius of convergence. However, (as Theo explains) a non-zero radius of convergence is good enough to build the Lie group in patches; this is one of the ways to prove that a Lie algebra always has a Lie group. Another formula for the exponential is the Taylor series: $$\exp(A) = 1 + A + \frac{A^2}2 + \frac{A^3}6\cdots.$$ This formula only makes sense in a matrix representation. But, if you have a matrix representation, it agrees with the other formula. Even in the complex group $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, the exponential map is not surjective. You cannot reach the element $$\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix},$$ although you can reach it and everything else in $\text{GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. The exponential map is always dense in a complex, connected Lie group and always surjective in a compact, connected Lie group. In a real non-compact Lie group such as $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, it isn't even dense (exercise). As Theo emphasizes, the important positive fact is that it's diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of the identity. You can walk to every point in any Lie group by taking products of elements in such a patch, and in this weaker sense every Lie group is generated by its Lie algebra. 

Here are some extra remarks about the argument. First, this combinatorial principle. Another illustration of the same principle is the fact that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if every finite subgraph is $k$-colorable. If the graph only has countably many vertices, then there is a standard proof by induction; it is only the uncountable case that requires something fancier such as the ultrafilter lemma or Tychonoff's theorem. In fact, the case that's needed is almost the same as the $k=2$ case of colorability. This case, and the orientability argument, is even easier than the general case because the local coloring or orientation is essentially unique. Second, cleaning up the atlas so that every chart is an interval and a non-empty intersection of any two charts is an interval. The first condition is sometimes part of the definition of an atlas. But if not, every open set in $\mathbb{R}$ is a countable union of intervals (or every open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a countable union of balls) and you can just make them separate charts. As for the second condition, using the intermediate value theorem and the Hausdorff condition, two interval charts can only intersect at one end or at both ends. If they intersect at both ends, then all of the other charts are redundant and the manifold is a circle. 

The 2-adic rationals $\mathbb{Q}_2$ and the 3-adic rationals $\mathbb{Q}_3$ are homeomorphic, because each one is a countable disjoint union of Cantor sets. They are also isomorphic as groups if you assume the axiom of choice, because they are both fields of characteristic 0 and therefore vector spaces over $\mathbb{Q}$ (of the same cardinal dimension). However, the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$ are a compact subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}_2$ in which every element is infinitely divisible by 3. On the other hand, in $\mathbb{Q}_3$, any non-trivial sequence $x, x/3, x/9, \ldots$ is unbounded in the complete metric, and is therefore not contained in a compact subgroup. 

As far as I can tell, "quiver" is a fancy word for a directed finite graph Yes. It doesn't even have to be finite. Or is there some philosophical reason path algebras are important? A huge application of path algebras lately is the path algebra of a quiver of Dynkin type. Following the ideas of Lusztig and Ringel, the representation varieties of these quivers are a main method to categorify quantum groups. A big share of the interest in quivers is either this specific purpose, or generalizations of features of this application. Lusztig's papers on this and his book are a big revelation. 

Whenever someone claims a proof (or disproof) of a big conjecture, many people leap to the question of whether the proof is correct. The problem then is it that it takes an enormous amount of work to confirm that a proof is correct. Even a clear mistake in a proof could be reparable. Moreover, attempted proofs have inferences that amount to gaps of different sizes. Even in a naive attempt, it can take a lot of work to decide which gaps are so big that the proof has to be called incomplete. There is a much simpler standard that experts use in practice: "As I start to read this paper, am I learning from it?" You would expect a proof of a big conjecture to have very interesting lemmas, and otherwise to teach you new things along the way. This is not always obvious either; there have been a few grievous misunderstandings in which initial readers dismissed a great paper. Even so, it's a somewhat reliable standard, and it's the most that authors can expect. When Perelman posted the first of his three papers on geometrization, experts in differential geometry quickly embraced it as exciting and teachable, before they had even checked half of that paper or seen the other two papers. From the beginning, this was very different from most claimed proofs of the Poincare conjecture, even most of the noble failures. The great ideas in these papers were more important than the fact that they had a lot of gaps (by common standards) and even some inessential mistakes (or so I was told). I know for a fact that experts sometimes do study weird-looking claims of big results, in the arXiv and elsewhere. They have little incentive to broadcast their attention to it if they think that it's shoddy work, but sometimes they try to be fair. For starters, the math arXiv has moderators, and they often take a look. I think that usually (not quite always), several people have looked long enough to decide that they aren't getting anything out of the paper. But hey, there could always be a diamond in the rough, or even a diamond in the garbage.
