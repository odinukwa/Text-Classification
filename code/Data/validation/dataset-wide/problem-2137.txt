You work for a USA company, but are working in India. They are effectively using your office as an outsourcing resource for the work they don’t think is important enough to use they own employees on. Even if you work for a “native” company, unless that company does more then provide cheap staff to other companies you will get the same problem. It is well known in the “west” that most India developers cannot produce useful results unless there is a very well defined spec – maintenance tasks tend to have a well defined spec. We used to call code written by the India outsourcing company “yes man” code – as they would never question what they were asked to do, just produce software that was no use to anyone. (Therefore it was best for us, if we somehow stop the management getting them to do anything important.) So you need to work for a company that does not depend on work from outside of India, or work for one of the few western companies that developers complete products in India from concept right though to sale and support. 

You can’t as per the other answers. However you are more likely to get them to agree to tell you the userIds of some of their programmers that have accounts on StackOverflow and Programmer. Looking at the problems their staff have will give you some idea what their code is like. 

If you go to HR about the meetings, expect your boss to push back on everything you have ever done in company time that is questionable. Likewise if your boss does not like you, expect to get smaller pay increase. If you have a union, talking to them may help, but your boss will know who the trouble maker is. One option is to record all the meetings, along with an email to your boss explaining that you will now attend them, as he has make it clear it is expected for you to do so. Then after you have left for a new job, and got a good reference, speak to a employment lawyer about making a claim for the unpaid hours. But it will get out what you have done, and other employers will avoid you due to it. 

It is a very bad question to ask at an interview without telling the candidate ahead of time you are going to ask it. However it would be a great question to ask at an interview if you ask the candidate to bring with them a printout of some code that they like, saying you would expect them to discuss it at the interview. The candidate should be given at least a few days warning of this. A variation on this, is to ask a recent comp sci student to bring a printout of their 3rd year project code, then pick a few pages at random and ask them what the code does and why they wrote it in that way. You are looking to see if the candidate can reason about the code, and show that they considered other options, and can accept that there is more than one correct way to solve a problem. Follower up questions can be like. 

I think your best bet is to fuse the two: Find a job at a retailer specializing in health care. Use this second degree to your advantage. There's virtually no combination of two degrees that one can't use to their advantage when you have the right attitude. Transition from one field to the other in a step-by-step manner like this: 

I don't think questions can reliably determine this. Two thinks you can rely on to a point are: Your gut feeling If you feel like they are trying to lull you and wouldn't hold up their end, don't take the position. Only take it if you feel really good about it. Your contract There are certain things you can have put into a contract if they're important to you. Some examples that I know: 

You want to have lunch with you colleague? Invite them. You want to be happy in the workplace? Make others in the workplace happy. You want to be included by others? Include them yourself. I would say "Do to others as you would have them do to you", if it wouldn't sound like preaching. How does this work? or: I want them to change, not myself! / This isn't about me but the other person. / But this is too simple, how can this work? Doing this exploits a neat little mechanism in the human mind. People call it the principle of reciprocity. Basically, somebody gives you something first, then asks something from you, you have a much harder time, saying no. Sales people love this. Here however you use it for something more benign. You give them something, say, attention or happiness, by inviting them to have lunch or what you may think of. Next time they think about who to invite (read: their brain asks them to invite you), they will include you, too. 

Any employee can use this excuse, and any employee is expected to inform the company in advance if the appointment is scheduled or to inform the company right away, if it's an unplanned visit. 

Just go ahead and ask for it. Be polite and state the purpose. For an annual review or similar it is totally legitimate to ask for such letters or mails and I wouldn't expect anybody to see this as selfish. Especially if they know the corporate ladder. Superiors should actually be happy about your request, I would think, as it shows you're invested in the company. EDIT: The pre-supposition is that the work done is actually out of scope of your current assignments and really goes 'above and beyond'. If you're just doing your work for somebody higher up in the food chain, this is what your job is about and you shouldn't expect any gold stars for it. 

Disability is a lack of certain abilities, just abilities considered ubiquitous. That what I suggest treating it like. 

I don't consider interviews as tests that can be passed or failed, but at opportunities to gauge whether the interviewee would fit the position I'm seeking filled. If they went through the trouble of researching what I might ask and prepared the answers on a sheet of paper, I might actually consider that a good thing, because it could show their determination to learn what it takes to get the job, and, by extension, maybe also do it well. What bad might come from this: probably only wasted time on either side. You pass the interviewee on to somebody with domain knowledge to find out whether their skills are adequate for the open position and they might figure out the interviewee is not. But unless you know the domain of the interviewee, you can't do much more than follow a script of questions about it. So failing to see that their answers might be scripted (unless you heard them before, verbatim), shouldn't reflect badly on you. 

There are a few differences. If someone is currently out of work, and does not have other job offer, the employer does not know if they truly want to take the job, or if they are just taking it due to having no other options, or to keep their unemployment benefit advisor happy. In the UK anyone on benefits has to prove they have put in enough job applications and list all interviews have had, often the benefit advisor will phone up an employer to check how some ones interview went. Therefore don’t expect them to tell you they don’t want to job, or know that they can’t do the job. Likewise it is required that someone takes the first job, even if they know they have another job starting in a few weeks time. On the other hand, no employer likes “letting someone go” within the probation period, but if a person is out of work, the employer can over then a few weeks extended trail, without feeling bad if things don’t work out. 

Your client’s staff still have to do their day job, just because someone has called you in to do a project does not mean any of the client’s staff have been told what work they can drop, so as to be able to help you. There is often a high level of resentment of past consultants that have taken the work that the client’s staff have done, and presented it as their own work. While at the same time the management refuses to ask their own staff the same questions directly. Remember you may have chosen to work 15hr days to get your next report in on time, but you can’t expect someone on normal salary to drop everything in their life just so you can do so. I have seen too many cases in the public sector in the UK, when a consultants will be called that costs £100K to do work, that could have been done in house if the people with the real understanding where resourced better so they were not at 100% capacity all the time. When it can take close to one year to get approval to bring in a £20K admin person, but the management has no problem finding the money for you, how can you expect any of the staff to respect what you are doing? So you need to find out how you can make the clients staff look good and feel better about their jobs, then do it. 

Reporting in sick must be easy and quick. I have worked for companies that require you to PHONE in and SPEAK to your manager, that can take 30 minutes on the phone if someone has to go to find the manager. It also has to be done at a time when the manger is at work – not good if someone wakes up sick at 6am and knows that are not fit to go into work that day. Therefore allow email and/or txt to be used. Never say anything negative to someone that reports in sick, they are helping you by doing so. Don’t question if the sickness is real etc. Leave all the questioning until the person is better, or let HR contact them after a few days. (Remember some people don't have a phone line or mobile coverage at home, there are even people without internet access at home.)
