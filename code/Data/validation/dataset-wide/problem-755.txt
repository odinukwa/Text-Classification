Take a sheet of paper. Glue/tape/whatever pairs of opposing edges together without twisting. The first such gluing will give a cylinder. The second then gives you a torus (a doughnut). This is a closed 2-d surface. It has no border. Things can just loop back to where they started by heading in a straight line. Practical note: you're likely to get a bit of a sharp bend in your torus, but that's the fault of the paper. In fact, try drawing curves on the paper to see what happens. If it's unfolded, connect points on borders exactly opposite each other (straight up/down or left/right on the paper). Fold it into a torus, and what do you see? When folded draw some lines on the torus that pass through the edges of the paper. As curvy as you want. Labelling each edge entry and exit will help in the next part. Now unfold it and what do you see? Indeed, if you've ever played the old arcade game Asteroids then you are already familiar with life on a torus. The lines you're drawing will behave exactly as your ship in the game will when you think of the unfolded paper as the screen. This is basically what is meant by a closed universe. A more precise description requires the use of topology and the concept of a (smooth) manifold. Manifolds can have boundaries (the ends of the cylinder, for example), though as far as I know all serious cosmological models are boundaryless. There would be interesting and distinctive physics on a boundary, to the point that it should have been pretty obvious if one existed in the visible universe. 

Stellar fusion and supernovae are governed by quantum particle interactions (on massive scales). In general there are many possible ways for particles to interact, decay, etc. at various probabilities. To understand the physics of a system correctly you must take account of all possibilities (up to an error tolerance in actual practice). One often sees phrases of the form "situation X favors reaction Y". This means the conditions (X) make the the probability of Y greater than any other possible reaction, but it doesn't equate to Y having probability 1. Some may prefer to use this phrasing for when Y's probability is, in some sense, much larger than any other event. The proton-proton chain that governs the main sequence stage of a star is a prime example of why you cannot discount the reactions which aren't favored. If you did, you would conclude that our own sun is incapable of fusion. The 'favored' reaction for two interacting protons in a star like our sun is to simply bounce off of each other thanks to Coulomb repulsion. The protons simply don't have enough energy to overcome this repulsion in order to undergo fusion. Technically this statement is also not probability 1, but rather very close to it. But an improbable quantum tunneling event is possible to bypass this potential barrier, allowing the interacting protons to fuse when they collide just right and the dice favor them. But a diproton is unstable. The heavily favored reaction in this state is for the diproton to immediately decay into two protons. But there is a small chance that one of the protons will undergo a beta decay into a neutron, instead, at which point you have a stable helium nucleus. That these things are so unlikely is a major factor in why our sun needs billions of years to exhaust enough of its hydrogen (aka protons) in order to initiate helium fusion and exit the main stage. Even very large stars still need millions of years because of this. So while the proton-proton reaction is rather unlikely, stars are simply so immense that it is not only a virtual certainty that some proton-proton reaction will yield helium, but in fact that it is a virtual certainty that the reactions will occur in large numbers and continuously until the available reactants dwindle. At the other extreme, we have supernovae. There are quite a lot of varieties of supernovae, but the commonly understood types--the outer layers collapse and then violently rebound off the core--feature a sudden loss of radiation pressure due to certain endothermic reactions becoming favorable. Iron production from fusion is the culprit here: it takes more energy to fuse it than is released. The final split second of this sort of star's life is when conditions favor the production of iron via fusion. Ridiculously favors it, as I really do mean it is the final split second. There is an inconceivably tiny chance that this iron production would fail to occur for some chosen period of time, and if it happens to stall long enough then the star would likely undergo some other event. See also David's answer for another wildly improbable, but technically possible, example of random chance altering a star's death. 

Ultimately this is more of an overly long comment, as I think a more satisfying and complete answer would properly explain things in a more concrete fashionâ€”more of a "it has to do this because..." answer than my "it can do this because..." one. The short of the answer to the first question is that helium fusion needs ~25 times the temperature that hydrogen fusion does. The proton-proton chain initates around $4\times 10^6$ Kelvin, whereas helium fusion doesn't begin until around $10^8$ Kelvin. So when the main stage ends and the helium core contracts and the temperature rises, the "edge" of the core can have temperatures well in excess of the minimum hydrogen fusion temperature, and so a shell around it can have temperatures well beyond it. Fusion rates are (approximately) polynomial in temperature, with the degree depending on the reaction in question, so small increases in temperature can produce substantially more fusion. The gravitational force is strong enough to overwhelm the pressure from the induced fusion, and so will contract the surrounding shell to temperatures in excess of the minimum needed. This is basically what happens in the cores of main sequence massive stars (relative to, say, the Sun). Actually, our own Sun's energy is mostly from the proton-proton chain and has a core temperature of around $1.57\times 10^7$ Kelvin, nearly four times the minimum necessary. And still, the core needs to be nearly 10 times hotter than that to initiate Helium fusion. For the second question, the short of the answer is that the core has undergone thermal expansion after the Helium flash, and so occupies the temperature ranges most conducive to a strong hydrogen fusion rate. The material outside the core is now at lower temperatures and pressure, so the fusion rate is reduced substantially. So the energy output comes principally from the core, and the helium fusion at near minimum temperatures releases less energy than the hydrogen shell at (well) beyond minimum temperatures did. Thus the star overall produces less energy and contracts. The remaining questions are explained in similar fashion: one has to pay attention to the sensitivity of reaction rates to temperature, and what the temperatures in those shells actually are. The sensitivities are different for each reaction chain, and the temperatures can go well beyond the minimum necessary.
