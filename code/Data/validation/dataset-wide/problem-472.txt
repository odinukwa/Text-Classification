I found a frame I'm interested in building up, but it doesn't include a fork. So I've been looking for carbon 700cc forks... with disc tabs. I've found a few, but ran into a new dilemma - curved vs straight? The frames I'm looking at are cyclocross/touring. I wouldn't think 29ers are into rigid front ends. Any reason to choose one over the other - brake chatter, bump suppression? 

Does an SPD/SPD-SL pedal exist? No, the cleat and retention is mutually exclusive. SPD is a two screw setup, while SPD-SL is a three screw setup... Does an SPD/SPD-SL shoe exist? Yes - these exist. The Shimano SH-R087G, for example. You'll find these lean towards road rather than offroad -- a more rigid sole, and small rubber spots to minimize the sound and harshness of walking in them. But the cleat is not recessed, so you can't walk normally. Offroad/casual shoes are SPD only, comfortable to walk in because the sole is more flexible and the cleat is recessed... It's pricey, but the Speedplay Zero system might be worth considering. Totally different cleat from the other systems mentioned (uses the old Time, four screw setup), there are Speedplay specific shoes so the cleat is more shallow than SPD-SL. 

It all depends on the horses' temperament. Some are OK, some like cars but not bicycles... Generally, horses with kids/teenagers riding them on the road will be pretty laid back. The horses that are being led by someone are much more suspect. Competent equestrian owners/staff know that any horse [that will be taken or ridden on roads] needs to be exposed very carefully (for the safety of the horse, the rider, and the general public). They have to accept that the horse may never be comfortable in that setting. But anything could spook the most experienced horse - you never know 100%. If possible, send a single person ahead to talk to who has control of the horse while watching how the horse reacts. 

I've verified that the hub spacing is 145mm - standard for a tandem. The hub on the bike is unmarked, unbranded, and Trek's website simply lists it as "alloy hub". It appears to be a 135mm hub with a longer axle and spacers in place. 

I have an old Trek T-900 tandem that my wife and I ride quite a bit. It's got an 8-speed rear setup. It's a standard (tandem) 145mm rear-spacing with matching hub, but tightening down the quick-release moves the derailleur hanger, screwing up the shifting. I can re-adjust, but next time I remove the wheel, it shifts poorly until adjusted again. This is an aluminum frame, so re-spacing it isn't an option. Ideas of what is going on here? 

Most road frames aren't going to take tires beyond 28mm. There are exceptions. Cyclocross bikes will take wider tires. A 'cross bike makes a good commuter if it has mount points for fenders and a rack. Although tire width is a personal preference, the wider road tires are usually better for commuting on city streets. I run 35mm tires on my city bike. The Scattante may end up being your fast bike. Then you can buy a commuter bike. Everyone should have more than one bike. :) 

I put a new hangar in place, and it did not fix the issue. Taking a closer look at things, it appears that this "tandem hub" is a standard 135mm hub with spacers to widen it out to 145mm. The hub is old and worn and one of the cones is bent. I serviced the hub to the best of my ability. I can't identify the hub to replace the cone. After putting everything back together, the hangar/frame/derailleur still bent inward, but only about half as much as before. I put a washer on the non-drive side of the hub to space it a little more. This appears to have fixed it. It'll take a few more miles to tell. A new wheel is in my future. 

No. The leader is working harder, breaking the wind for those behind them. Having people behind you doesn't change that. 

There's too little information to say much about your diet, and it's not the sort of thing anyone can definitively recommend without having seen you in person and having more detail. Your doctor would be a good place to start, there are numerous diet strategies you can research. 

I agree with Hicks sentiment that the crank "giving" is more likely due to worn parts or misalignment. The crank would have to flex a lot to actually be responsible for ghost shifting, which would make it incredibly poor quality. Sheldon's article strikes me as cursory for "When Should You Stand"... Assuming you have the gearing for whatever you're riding (reasonable terrain), yes - there shouldn't be a need to stand to pedal. Bypassing what Sheldon covered about gearing and saddle height... From a road riding perspective, standing takes less effort because you can use body weight rather than legs to crank over. It's used a lot when hill climbing - gives the legs a rest, and the opportunity to sprint when others don't know to. The gist I got recently was "if others are standing, so should you" - it struck me as prudent if you don't know the route, otherwise ride as you feel comfortable. Standing is often used to initiate a sprint on more level ground, to get the momentum up. But depending on the speed, being out of the saddle can mean your body is creating more drag -- counteracting what you intended to do. I stood while mountain biking on a hard tail (no rear suspension), for psuedo-suspension. I remember my quads getting a workout until I built up the strength. I still habitually take weight off my saddle when riding road. 

This would generally come down to you locality as some cultures would consider certain gestures rude. I guess there isn't a universal sign for thank you, but in most cultures I think a wave of the hand (more of a raise the hand and show the palm slightly) with a courteous smile or nod would do the trick. I tend to vary between a wave of the hand or a thumbs up followed by a wave of the hand. A smile always tends to convey gratitude, but that depends on whether you can be seen clearly or not. 

If I think of anything else I will add it to the list, but these are some of the main things to consider that I can think of. 

EDIT: I misunderstood your situation hence my original answer. In the case that your shoe is still stuck to the cleat, remove the pedal from the bike first. Keeping the pedal on the bike will just restrict your motion as the crank arm and frame will get the in way. Put the pedal in a vice grip or between two solid objects which allow you to keep the pedal still. Then simply twist the shoe in the normal unlocking direction until it disengages from the pedal. Having the pedal off the bike will allow you to turn the shoe a whole lot further and allow you to unclip. I don't suspect you would cause any damage this way. Removal if it's just the cleat stuck (not on shoe) Firstly make sure that the spring tension on the pedal is all the way down. This is lowered by turning the little hex / Allen screw to the left as much as it will go. Releasing this tension on the spring will make the job a whole lot easier. Then use a set of needle-nose pliers to twist the cleat, simulating the twisting of your foot as you would when it's attached to a shoe. If this doesn't work, you can try and use screwdrivers to pry the tensioned 'catch' away from the cleat, hopefully releasing enough pressure to twist it and remove it. In terms of damaged caused, you may scratch the cleat and/or pedal, but I guess no more than you would by clipping in and out and walking around.
