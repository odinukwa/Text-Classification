In the proof of Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem, you need to choose a way to encode formulas and proofs as numbers. The easy way to do this is to take 2i03i15i3...pjij. However you can instead use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to pick a number congruent to i0 mod p0, congruent to i1 mod p1, etc. (Of course, you need to pick big enough primes then.) The advantage of doing this is you no longer need exponentiation in your theory, just multiplication and adition. 

Let me work out the idea of Ulrich, and deduce that the answer to the question is negative, namely a cubic three-fold is not diffeomorphic to any rational variety. The idea of Urlich is that if a rational threefold is diffeomorpic to a cubic then it is a Fano with $Pic=\mathbb Z$. So we just have to check that cubic is not diffeomorphic to any other type of three dimensional Fanos with $Pic=\mathbb Z$. There exist $17$ families of Fano threefolds with $Pic=\mathbb Z$ ($\mathbb CP^3$, quadric, five Fanos of index two including cubics, and $10$ Fanos of index $1$). The description can be found here one page two: $URL$ Let $H$ be the hyperplane section of the cubic, then $H^3$ equals $3$, i.e., the degree of the cubic. So the cubic has the following property: if we take all classes in integral second cohomology of the cubic then their cubes are of the form $3\cdot n^3$ where $n\in \mathbb Z$. Checking the list of $17$ Fanos we see that the cubic is the only one with this property. So it is not diffeomorphic to any other Fano three fold. 

Another example is certain strong forms of Fubini's Theorem. If you have a real value function on the product of two closed intervals which is bounded, and which is measurable in either coordinate when you fix the other, are the two iterated integrals equal? (In the actual Fubini's theorem you care about joint measurability, not just measurability on either coordinate.) If you assume CH, it is easy to construct counterexamples. It turns it is also consistent to have models where it is true. I don't have a good reference on this, if you know of one please add it in to my answer. 

By Classical I mean something that could have been found before 1900 (say). A well known consequence of Bezout's theorem for plane curves is Pascal's theorem $URL$ . I am curious if there are some other statements that you find pretty that can be formulated (almost) as elementarily as Pascal's theorem and proven using higher dimensional Bezout's theorem? For example, is there some statement that involves quadrics, planes and lines (cubics?...)? Motivation. I ask this question since I want to finish to teach my (introductory) course in algebraic geometry by higher-dimensional Bezout theorem (using Hilbert polynomials, ect), and I would be extremely happy to give some pretty application :). To give you an idea of the level of the course, it is based on some bits of Harris book "Algebraic geometry first course", Disclaimer. I don't doubt the usefulness of Bezout theorem and am sorry if the original question sounded like I doubt it. On the contrary I based the elementary course in algebraic geometry that I teach on this theorem. Namely, the course starts with Bezout for plane curves (using resultants), intorduces projective spaces and varieties, goes through Hilbert basis theorem and Hylbert polynomials (last section of Atiyah-Macdonald) and then as an applications we get a proof of a simplest version of Bezout's theorem in high dimension. Also, It would be difficult for me to explain what I mean by pretty in math (for myself) but still I feel that the using of this word is justified, because we, mathematicians use this word... Sometimes we disagree on what is pretty, but personally I find pretty huge amount of facts in algebraic geometry. In other words I will be happy to see any application that can be stated in the language on the level of my course. In the comment I put the link to the question on stackexchange 

If your question is "Are there uncomputable functions which cannot compute Halt?" then the answer is yes. If you take all functions from ℕ to ℕ, "can compute each other" is a natural equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are called Turing degrees. The computable functions form the minimal degree, 0. The Turing degree of Halt is called 0', pronounced zero jump. (For any degree A, the degree of Halt with A as an oracle is written A'). There are lots of degrees which are strictly between 0 and 0'. The question as phrased, suggests that logic constructions are unnatural or abnormal. This attitude is flatly wrong. Offhandedly rejecting such arguments is as quackish as claiming the real numbers are "morally countable". Computation, definability, and diagonalization are embedded deeply in a wide range of mathematical systems. (See Hilbert's 10th Problem or Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem) 20th century logic is a reality of mathematics. 

This question is quite subtle, I don't believe the answer is known in the general situation. But if you consider the case of $1$-forms on surfaces, one can completely characterise those that are harmonic. They form a "space" of finite dimension modulo self-diffeos of the surface. They are called minimal, and they can all be represented as real parts of some holomorphic $1$-forms. Minimal 1-forms on a surface $S$ are characterised by the property that for each point $x\in S$, where the one-form is non-vanishing there exists a circle $S^1$ on $S$ such that the one-form restricted to $S^1$ has not zeros while $x\in S^1$. For example, in the case of a $T^2$ a one-form is harmonic for some metric iff it has no zeros at all. 

A certain rectangle can be covered by 25 coins of diameter 2. Can it always be covered with 100 coins of diameter 1? 

Yes. Here's a sketched example: Start in L. Let P be the forcing which adds ω1 many Cohen reals, and let G be an L-generic filter for P. Then L(ℝ)L[G] will model ZF, but will have no well ordering of the reals. The point is that if σ is an automorphism of P, then σ can be extended to an elementary map from L[G] to L[σ[G]], and this extension will fix L(ℝ)L[G]. So if there was a well ordering of ℝ in L(ℝ)L[G], it would give a well ordering of G which was fixed by σ. But σ can reorder the elements of G because of the homogeneity of P. 

It turns out that it is nice to read books. The answer to the weaker version of my question with $O|z|^{n+1}$ term is contained on page 17 of McDuff-Salamon book [MS] (no need of Micallef-White!): $URL$ Proof. In the proof of Lemma 2.2.3 of [MS] one uses coordinates in $\mathbb C^2$ such that $C_1$ is given by $w=0$ and the almost complex structure $J$ along the line $(z,0)$ is the standard one. Then it is explained that the almost complex map $z\to \mathbb C^2$ corresponding to $C_2$ is given by $$z\to (p(z)+O(|z^{n+1}|), az^n+O(|z^{n+1}|))$$ where $p(z)$ is a polynomial of order at most $n$, $a\ne 0$. In our case of course $p'(0)\ne 0$. It is now clear that in these coordinates $C_2$ is as need. QED. Comment. The above proof is elementary and does not use Micallef-White. Similarly to Micallef-White's, statement it can be used to answer the original question with a $C^1$-smooth change of coordinates (instead of $C^{\infty}$). Indeed, after a smooth reparameterization in $z$ and scaling in $w$ the above map for $C_2$ looks as $$z\to (z, z^n+O(|z^{n+1}|)).$$ Denote the second term by $f(z)$. Then the map $(z,w)\to (z,w-(f(z)-z^n)/z^n)$ is $C^1$ and it sends the couple $C_1,C_2$ to the couple $(w=0, w=z^n)$. I wonder still if one can make this last change of coordinates $C^{\infty}$... 

Suppose one wants to color the points in the plane so any two points at distance one apart are different colors. How many colors are needed? I heard this problem when I was a kid. Back then the most I knew was that 3 is impossible and 7 is possible (tile hexagons of diameter 1-ε). I haven't heard about this problem since then and I don't know how to search for it. Is more known? Is this problem well known in certain circles? 

Let $M^{2n}$ be a symplectic manifold and let $M^{2n-2}$ be a symplectic submanifold. How to construct a non-trivial Hamiltonian $S^1$-action on $M^{2n-2}$ on a small neighborhood of $M^{2n-2}$, that would fix $M^{2n-2}$? (I think I saw a reference to this statement in some book, but can not find it now.) 

Take a convex polyhedron $P$ in $\mathbb R^3$ and remove all the faces, i.e. leave only the edges. Call this graph $E$. Let us now try to continuously deform $E$ in $\mathbb R^3$ so that all the edges of $E$ keep their length and remain straight (like metal sticks), but allow the change of angles between the edges. Question. Is it true that $E$ admits non-trivial deformations (not globally isomteric) if at least one face of $P$ is not a triangle? Note that if all the faces of $P$ are triangles it is not deformable by Cauchy's rigidity theorem: $URL$ 

Q: How do you tell an extroverted mathematican from an introverted one? A: An extroverted mathematician stares at your shoes when talking to you. 

No, it's impossible for any axiom system. If Σ is consistent, then by the Completeness theorem, it has some model M. In M, φ is either true or false. So M is a model of either (Σ+φ) or (Σ+not φ). So at least one of them is consistent. It might be that your metatheory doesn't know which one is consistent, but it knows that at least one of them is.
