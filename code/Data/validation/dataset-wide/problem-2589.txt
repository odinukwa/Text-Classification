I think that the reason you only find references to homosexual activity in the vinaya is BECAUSE the vinaya is the only place where there is a need to be specific regarding sexual acts... Oral sex is still oral sex whether it's performed by a man or a woman, an animal or even yourself. In the Suttas, the teachings, it doesn't matter if you are attracted to the opposite sex, same sex, etc. it's all about craving,clinging, desire, attachment, and aversion all underpinned by ignorance. These come from the mind and go far deeper then sexual identity and attraction. As for Homosexuality and the Theravada tradition, buddhanet.net strikes again: $URL$ 

"And how is a monk one with a sense of Dhamma? There is the case where a monk knows the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question & answer sessions.[1] If he didn't know the Dhamma — dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question & answer sessions — he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. So it's because he does know the Dhamma — dialogues... question & answer sessions — that he is said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. This is one with a sense of Dhamma. 

I'm in a period of my practice where i feel ready for a retreat. I have been looking into different types of retreats and have found the Goenka 10-day retreat the most suitable one for me as a first-timer. I do however not now when i will be able to attend one due to long waiting time in the area close to me and my current job do not allow me to travel. I was wondering about the reintegration-process back into society after 10 days with silence and minimal contact with people and no contact with the outside world. I have done small "retreats" by myself where i would buy food for 1-2 days and then stay inside and meditate. When i went outside after a couple of days and talked to other people i found that i had some aversion towards people and felt uncomfortable in their presence. I would rather stay for myself. I do not know how a 10-day retreat will affect me or if it will. Personal experiences and methods for dealing with people when comming out of a retreat is what i'm looking for. A side note - i will be doing the 10-day retreat in another country than where i live. I dont know if that has something to say but now the information is there. Thank you very much. 

As a Theravadan ive made the mistake of thinking Buddha Nature is just "everyone's ability to become awakened". There is apparently more to it then that but im in no way qualified to explain that as I have much to learn about it myself. As for Theravada it is true as far as I have seen in my years of study and practice that "buddha nature" is not taught. However the Buddha says many times in the suttas that everyone has the ability to become awakened bases on their own effort and practice in this very life, so in that sense everyone has a "buddha nature". Also it may be important to note the differences between arahants and buddhas between the traditions. In Theravada the only difference between a buddha and an arahant is that a buddha finds the path on their own when it has been lost, there is no difference between a buddha and an arahant in terms of wisdom/ability etc in Theravada, not so in Mahayana. 

For Theravada there is the Tipitaka: $URL$ This consists of the "three baskets" of the vinaya pitaka, the rules for monastics, the sutta pitaka aka the sutta teachings, and the abidhamma. It is generally accepted that the oldest and most core part of the Tipitaka that is closest to what the buddha said, are the four Nikayas Digha Nikaya (long discourses) Majjhima Nikaya ( middle length) Samyutta Nikaya (grouped discourses) Anguttara Nikaya ( numbered discourses) There is also the Khuddaka Nikaya which is a collection of "little texts". This is where the famous dhammapada and Sutta Nipāta reside. 

Here is a website with a teaching by Mahasi Sayadaw – Endless Moments of Insight. In here he address obstacles such as "distracting thoughts, physical discomfort, how to work with mental states, how to increase the number of objects that are being observed, distractions from the path etc.". 

Regarding the past. What have been done have been done. Pondering about it is not conducieve to ones practice. Reacting to these mental formations only serve to bring one away from the Present moment and into delusion. Remorse, regret of the past, thinking about what could have been done differently belongs to the 4th hindrance, ie. Restlessness and Worry. The hindrances are what keeps on from developing in meditation. You can read more about them here. 

A way to deal with this is to restrain the mind by choosing to note only experiences from e.g. the 1st and 2nd foundation of mindfulness. One could also start with only one foundation and then add more when mindfulness grows. It's similar as to when one is starting to do walking meditation. One will start by noting only the "stepping" movement of the foot. When one gets better one can begin to include the "lifting" movement too and with more practice one can include the "placing" movement of the foot. This way one is building more steps into the practice as mindfulness grows and one gains the ability to be aware of more phenomena. 

I would say not at all, but in all honestly I bet any of us can take our own perspective and pick the Buddhas words to make our argument. Seems to be from my perspective that the Buddha mostly stayed out of politics with the rare exception of counseling kings who came to him and even then the advice was mostly about the ruler themselves performing skillful actions just like the rest of us, not about grand political maneuvers. I actually wonder if the scope of this question is even appropriate for this website, considering it is a basic Q&A about Buddhism and this could turn into a political debate. 

I'm often interested in the history of Buddhist texts and being a Theravadan i'm not very familiar with the Mahayana texts. Please help to educate me in this manner. 

For most of human history your word truely was your bond.. It was everything, and to lie was to put the reputation of your house, your family, and yourself in danger to the point where you became an outcast or worse. These days things are different in many ways, our words are not necessarily connected to our social and physical survival, but they are still important. When trust is lost it is not so easily gained back. So do i believe anyone who lies will also kill people and do horrible things? Most likely not, but deliberate lieing is a dangerous thing that is unskillful and not beneficial to yourself or others. It puts us back along the path and is to be avoided at all costs. 

In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the Buddha teaches how a practitioner should dwell with (right) mindfulness of body and mind; 

Cultivate compassion towards a being filled with hatred. Such a being is in great suffering, even more so if they are not aware of the damaging effects of hatred. Show them loving-kindness. If one is radiating loving-kindness, harmlessness and non-hostility, it will eventually affect people in the vicinity. 

When doing vipassana meditation and when one is observing an object - for how long does one keep observing and noting the object? I have been wondering about this for a while now since i do not know what the "correct" approach is if such an approach exist. I have once read that one should keep observing the object until it ceases to exist in order to clearly see the dissolution-step of the process that all objects follow -> Arising, Presence, Dissolution. Thereby one will be able to see the impermanent nature of phenomena. Help would be much appreciated. Thank you. Lanka 

If one of these factors are not fulfilled, the precept is still intact. For more information, please see "Ask A Monk: Mark Zuckerberg, Vegetarianism and Killing" by Ven. Yuttadhammo. 

In the famous Maha-parinibbana Sutta, there is a passage where the Buddha explains to the wandering ascetic Subhadda, that "in any doctrine & discipline", that does not contain the Noble Eightfold Path, enlightened beings cannot be found. That is very important since it shows that only teachings that contain the noble eightfold path can lead to freedom from suffering, to Nibbana. The quoted passage can be found below. 

As far as I can tell the "Animal realm" includes insects. It is a sentient being and I don't see why they wouldn't be a part of samsara. 

Questions in the title. What is the significance of this term and how it is used by the Buddha in the suttas? 

There are multiple answers in the link you posted that explain what sexual misconduct is and masturbation cannot be considered among the ranks of actions named sexual misconduct. Now you MAY have a case if you use the word sensual misconduct as the translation, then actions like over eating and excessive masturbation could be considered abuse of the senses. Masturbation does not alter the mind state. If you look deep enough, masturbation is done BECAUSE of a mind state. Masturbation is only an issue for monastics, and is not something the laity need to go fret too much about, at least until such time as the practice starts to show them the futility of sexual actions, then it naturally falls away. 

There is this section on being a warrior regarding right livelihood. Right Livelihood : samma ajivo $URL$ Considering becoming a soldier? You may want to reconsider... Then Yodhajiva the headman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Lord, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that 'When a warrior strives & exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down & slay him while he is striving & exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.' What does the Blessed One have to say about that?" "Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that." A second time... A third time Yodhajiva the headman said: "Lord, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that 'When a warrior strives & exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down & slay him while he is striving & exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.' What does the Blessed One have to say about that?" "Apparently, headman, I haven't been able to get past you by saying, 'Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that.' So I will simply answer you. When a warrior strives & exerts himself in battle, his mind is already seized, debased, & misdirected by the thought: 'May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed. May they not exist.' If others then strike him down & slay him while he is thus striving & exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle. But if he holds such a view as this: 'When a warrior strives & exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down & slay him while he is striving & exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle,' that is his wrong view. Now, there are two destinations for a person with wrong view, I tell you: either hell or the animal womb." When this was said, Yodhajiva the headman sobbed & burst into tears. [The Blessed One said:] "That is what I couldn't get past you by saying, 'Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that.'" "I'm not crying, lord, because of what the Blessed One said to me, but simply because I have been deceived, cheated, & fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of warriors who said: 'When a warrior strives & exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down & slay him while he is striving & exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.' — SN 42.3 

It sounds like you might be experiencing the third hindrance for meditative progress, i.e. "Sloth and Torpor" (thina-middha). This hindrance is a mental tiredness that arises and makes the mind cloudy and unwieldy. The Five Hindrances are briefly: 

The best way would be to practice vipassana meditation and thereby train to realize the 3 signs of existence; anicca, dukkha, anatta. When beginning to understand these signs one gradually lets go of the "grabbing, holding onto, attaching to" to phenomena. Why? One realizes through the insight meditation that all phenomena both physical and mental are impermanent and thereby unsatisfactory. When realizing them one begins to understand not-self. Impermanence and unsatisfactoriness are the easiest to realize while not-self is more tricky. Although one can realize it through diligent practice. All phenomena are impermanent because they are conditioned. They are built/caused by other causes which again is caused by other causes. That means that all conditioned phenomena are subject to constant alteration and change. Nothing is permanent. All conditioned phenomena follow a recipe of "arising, presence, dissolution". Because of this constant flux and change phenomena are unsatisfactory. They are not worth holding on to because they will cause you suffering when they cease. There is no stability, no permanency so if one grabs onto something one will loose it in the end anyway. When seeing this over and over in the meditation the mind will gradually turn away from conditioned phenomena. The mind will realize that happiness cannot be found in conditioned phenomena. The mind will begin to let go. It will gradually stop "reaching out" to phenomena. Freedom from suffering comes from renunciation and non-reacting to phenomena. Its great freedom when one realizes that one do not have to be sucked into the maelstroem everytime a phenomena arises and that one instead can be an observer. Ajahn Brahm describes it like having a "teflon/non-stick* mind. Like the non-stick pan where nothing can stick to. So in short. Practicing vipassana meditation will be your best bet at overcoming attachment to wordly phenomena.
