It looks like it's been cut too short so can't be tucked out of the way. But you may be able to cut it still shorter and use a smaller end cap/ferrule, or just part of one, or a blob of glue to stop the end fraying. Bending the cable may work too -- you might not have enough length but a sharp bend away from the tyre might work. Use longnose pliers. This stopped my front derailleur cable irritating my leg, for example. You're right to want to fix it -- metal rubbing on tyres isn't a good thing. 

In addition to your other answer, it's well worth checking/changing the cables. Rusty cables (or full of muck) have more friction which means more of the force on the lever goes into bending the cables. This is especially true if the cable routing has significant bends (more common at the back). New cables ran so much better for me that I could reduce the tension in the return springs as well. My bike with cantilevers has plastic brake levers that bend if you pull hard enough, and hit the grips, limiting the maximum force, so the cables have to be just right. 

First ride update: As expected, I can't mash and accelerate anymore, but it doesn't matter. I really enjoy the high cadence and the fact that I can still hit the same speeds as before (albeit slower). I'm looking forward to my first big climb on Wednesday! 

I'm trying to free my aluminum seatpost corroded to a CrMo frame. One of the methods is to heat the aluminum seatpost and then to let it cool. In theory, the aluminum will expand twice as fast as steel and hence the expansion/contraction should crack the bond. Some recommend using a blow torch or even boiling water. I don't have access to a blow torch, but was wondering if there was something better than boiling water. Recipe for disaster? 

I'm considering making the above change in crank sets primarily because 53/39 is really hard on the hills here. I have 11-28 at the back. I don't see a downside to this since it seems like I will always be in the middle of the cassette while climbing. Of course my speed on the flats will take a hit but I don't spend too much time on 53/11. Also if it seems like too much, I can always go for 11-25 in the back. I'd appreciate any comments on your experience with a 46/30. Update: So I decided to crunch some numbers. Also, I'm considering the IRD Defiant Wide Compact. The following comparison is between the usual compact (50/34) and the IRD (46/30). Combinations with a chain angle greater than 1.5Â° are grayed out. I think this analysis confirms that my ability on flats and descents will be different (different gear ratios). However, the effect on climbs (within the chain angle constraint) is equivalent to swapping the 2.43 ratio (on the 34) for the 1.25 (on the 30) which is fine by me. 

Carb loading (cycling weekly) is reckoned to be useful for exercise over about 90 minutes, so is probably a good idea for all-day riding. Done properly you're taking on extra carbs starting 36--48 hours before the event. I've seen some advice online but it's all from gel/energy drink manufacturers, so biased towards their products and away from proper food. So: How does this translate to multi-day riding? Or in more detail: 

On new or newly fitted tyres it's worth riding cautiously at first anyway, though not for as long as the winter tyre manufacturers suggest (just in case of bad seating, trapped tubes etc.). When the weather worsens it's worth riding cautiously anyway (cars do funny things when the driver has only cleared the ice off a small area of windscreen). Getting used to the extra noise is another reason to ride slowly. Certainly I back off if the bike ever sounds odd, and studs on tarmac sound odd until you get used to them. So you might just take it a little easier than normal. That doesn't mean lower top speeds but gentler acceleration, braking and cornering, for a few tens of km (average across a few manufacturers). I'd round that to a week, given my commute. You're not going to get any personal records on these tyres anyway, and the time lost to riding a little more gently is less than the time lost to common but worse than normal traffic. I didn't lose any studs in the first 50km on mine (Schwalbe) but had lost a few by the end of last winter. I do wonder if the manufacturers aren't so much worried about seating the studs as not having them unseat suddenly when you're riding hard. 

I have Mavic Reflex 622 x 13 (700c) wheels which currently hold 25mm tires. Can I use 23mm tires on them? 

I got a set of aerobars for free and decided to install them on my hybrid. 1) I just tried them and feel a bit unstable. After checking it out online, I see this is normal, but I wonder if there is an optimal way to install them to reduce instability. 2) Does it make sense to install them on a hybrid? My hands do get numb during a long ride and I have always wanted to shift between positions. 3) While riding them, I feel more in control when my elbows are on my flat handlebars and thus not on the pads. Could this be because my seat isn't high enough (that's another problem altogether since my aluminum seatpost is corroded to my CrMo frame)? 

These 38/50/60/88 numbers are the 'depth' of the wheel's aerodynamic rim, in millimeters. Let's take 38 for example. This means that from where the tire meets the wheel, the rim extends an additional 38 millimeters towards the hub. When you see 88, that means the rim extends 88 millimeters from the tire. Why does that matter? One of the biggest benefits of carbon wheels is the aerodynamics. They play a major role in how fast, and how efficiently a cyclist can ride. Think back to when you were on a ride with your buddies, and drafted behind another rider. It's much easier to keep up with them, because of the better aerodynamics when you are drafting. Your spinning wheels are the biggest source of slow aerodynamic turbulence. To improve this, we build wheels with aerodynamic advantage as a top priority. The way we do this is to increase the 'depth' of the rim. The deeper the rim, the more aerodynamic the wheel will be and the more efficiently and faster you'll be able to cut through the wind. An 88mm deep rim is more aerodynamic than a 38mm rim, and will be faster in situations where aerodynamics are very important, like long fast solo riding and triathlons. Why would anyone choose 38mm rims, if 88mm rims are more aerodynamic? The more a wheel becomes aerodynamic for going forward, the more it can be negatively affected by cross-winds, or winds coming from the side. Let's imagine you are riding with an 88mm deep front and rear rim. You will be able to go very fast because of the aerodynamics of deep wheels, but if a gust of wind comes from the side, that wind will push sideways against the large rims and push the whole bike sideways. This isn't such a big deal if you're riding alone, such as in a triathlon, but if you are riding in a group of cyclists, this sideways push could cause an impact with other riders, or at the very least it would require extra concentration from you. What's the solution? A wheel with a 'shallower' rim depth, like a 38mm, will be less affected by crosswinds, but will also have less aerodynamic advantage. If that wasn't enough, you must also consider weight. A 38mm deep wheel will be lighter than an 88mm deep one, because less carbon is used. A lighter wheel will accelerate faster and will be much easier to ride up hills. This means that if you are sprinting and hill climbing a lot, a shallower rim, like a 38 will be best. Why do I see some riders with different front and rear wheels? Due to the fact that the front wheel can turn for steering, its more susceptible to cross-wind interference. The rear wheel is fixed in a straight line with the bike, so if a cross-wind hits it, the impact on the bike won't be as much. This means that you can use a deeper rim on your rear wheel without impacting handling as much as that same rim would affect the front wheel. Wheelsets such as the 38-50 to take advantage of this fact. This wheelset uses a 38mm front rim, and a 50mm rear rim. This way you can get more aerodynamic advantage without sacrificing as much stability in windy conditions. How do I choose? This is the most difficult choice for riders looking to purchase new carbon bicycle wheels. You must think about the situations you ride in. If you ride mostly hills you will want to choose a 38mm wheelset, if you are an all around rider choose a 50mm wheelset, if you are an all around rider looking for more aerodynamic advantage choose a 60mm wheelset, and if you are a solo rider, or a triathlete choose an 88mm wheelset.
