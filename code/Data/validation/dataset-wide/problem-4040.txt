If G is finite, do you need to take the GIT quotient? Maybe just the usual categorical would work. A necessary condition is that for any point x of P(V) its stabilizer acts trivially on the fiber of your line bundle at x. The stabilizer would also be finite, and its action on the one-dimensional fiber factors through the quotient by the commutator subgroup. Since the values of the one dimensional representation homomorphism must be roots of unity, after taking appropriate tensor power the action will become trivial. Say, if you consider O(n) where n is the order of G. 

Suppose that A is an associative algebra, but not Frobenius. Does the Cyclic Cohomology of A have a structure of a BV algebra? All results I could find first identify A with its dual but I am asking about a general associative A. 

It is known that a flasque sheaf on a topological space has trivial cohomology. Suppose that we are in a relative situation of a smooth fibration $\pi: X \to S$ and $F$ is a sheaf on $X$. Is there are weaker condition on $F$ which implies that the higher direct images to $S$ are trivial (but not necessarily the cohomology groups of $F$ on $X$). 

Unless you know that $F'$ has a finite locally free resolution, and this will tend to fail when $F'$ is the skyscraper sheaf of a singular point. But maybe you just want to work with $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $X$. 

I have a question about weak factorization of birational maps (in characteristic zero). If $X_1 \to X_2$ is a birational map of smooth varieties, it was proved some time ago that we can decompose it into a sequence of blowups and blowdowns with smooth centers. Now, suppose that $X_1, X_2$ are resolutions of the same $Y$, so they admit a birational morphism to $Y$. Can we find a factorization into blowups and blowdowns so that on each intermediate step we also have a morphism to $Y$? Is this written up somewhere? 

Lurie proves that formal $E_\infty$ moduli problems over a field $k$ are equivalent to augmented $E_\infty$-algebras. Is there a reasonably small model for this when $k = \mathbb{F}_p$? Or maybe we could have a similar, but different, statement where we start with moduli problems over [commutative algebras with additional Steenrod operations], and on the output we get a suitably modified category of dg Lie algebras? 

Now, maybe there's some other way of modeling connective spectra with strictly symmetric monoidal but topologically enriched categories. But I think our work proves it can't be done in a way that generalizes the ordinary classifying space functor when the enrichment is discrete. 

Category theory: There is an isomorphism between a vector space and its double-dual which does not depend on choice of basis. It is natural in the sense that every vector space has such an isomorphism, and these isomorphisms commute with every linear transformation. This should be contrasted between the isomorphisms between a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual. These depend on a choice of basis and are not natural in this sense. This example constitutes the first two paragraphs of the first paper in category theory! Eilenberg-Mac Lane: General theory of natural equivalences. In Categories for the working mathematician, Mac Lane writes that the purpose of discussing categories is to discuss functors, and that the purpose of discussing functors is to discuss natural transformations. 

Motivation Two of my colleagues were discussing the behavior of cos along the positive real axis on our department mailing list. I was curious about the complex behavior, but this is outside my field, so started making pictures like the ones shown here. I've been thinking about these off and on for a little over a year, but not really made any progress or had anyone give me a useful reference. So I wanted to see what the wider MO community has to say. If you want some higher-resolution pictures for cos, see this G+ post: $URL$ 

Given a complex number $z$, consider the sequence \begin{align*} a_0 & = 1\\ a_1 & = (cos(1))^z\\ a_n & = (cos(a_{n-1}))^z \end{align*} This question is about trying to understand periodicity in such sequences. For real $z < 2$, the sequence converges to a fixed point. For larger real $z$, the sequence oscillates between two distinct limit points. This behavior can be explained by elementary dynamics, and one can find that the transition point is around $2.188$. I was surprised to find that the behavior for general complex $z$ is, well, complex! Define a function $P$ from the complex plane to $\mathbb{N}$ as follows: $$P(z) = \mathrm{number\ of\ limit\ points\ of\ the\ sequence}\ \{1, cos(1)^z, cos(cos(1)^z)^z, \ldots\}$$ Here is a picture of $P$: this is the region $[-8,8] \times [-8,8]$ and the pixel at $z$ is given color $n$ by some software that estimates $P(z)$. 

The closest I have seen to what you are asking, is the paper Hübl, Reinhold; Yekutieli, Amnon Adelic Chern forms and applications. Amer. J. Math. 121 (1999), no. 4, 797–839. Not quite Riemann-Roch, but probably the right approach. 

Is there a transparent explanation of why the singular cochain complex of a topological space X is an $E_\infty$ algebra. There are combinatorial proofs using, say, the surjection operad, but is there a topological picture behind those? If we wanted to restrict,say, to the level of little (2-)discs, could we describe the structure using something like Eilenberg-Zilber contractions of $C^*(X^m)$ onto $C^*(X)^{\otimes m}$, various diagonal maps and so on? 

You may want to look at curves in three dimensional projective space. I vaguely remember, although I may be wrong, that there was a component with general member non-reduced. 

I am reading two papers by Daniel Grayson: "Localization for flat modules in algebraic K-theory" and "Algebraic cycles and algebraic K-theory" and I am wondering if any recent advances in K-theory can extend the results a bit. Specifically, suppose $\pi: X \to S$ is a smooth projective morphism of relative dimension 2. Mimicking Corollary 1.6 in the second paper, can we write an exact complex of sheaves $$ 0 \to \mathcal{K}_3 (X) \to \mathcal{K}_3^{0/1}(X/S) \to \mathcal{K}_2^{1/2}(X/S) \to \mathcal{K}_1^2(X/S) \to 0? $$ The sheaves involved are sheafification of K-theory in Zariski or etale topology. The last term is K-theory of coherent sheaves flat over $S$ with support of relative codimension 2 (i.e. support finite over $S$). The two intermediate terms are some kind of relative K-theory for the pairs built from coherent sheaves (flat over $S$) with support of relative codimension 0 (resp. 1) and its subcategory of sheaves with support of relative codimension 1 (resp. 2). In fact, I am OK with a resolution of this nature where the two middle terms can be a bit more obscure than stated, as long as the first and the last terms remain the same. An alternative: when $Y \to S$ is a flat family of projective curves, but not necessarily smooth, is there an analogue of the resolution $$ 0 \to \mathcal{K}_2(Y) \to \mathcal{K}_2^{0/1}(Y/S) \to \mathcal{K}_1^1(Y/S) \to 0 $$ stated in Corollary 1.6 for the case when $Y$ is relatively smooth over $S$? Again, it's OK if the middle term gets a bit more obscure, as long as the other two survive (maybe with the correction that the first term is K-theory of coherent sheaves, not of projective modules). 

Black pixels are points where the software cannot detect periodicity. The correspondence between colors and numbers is as follows, where 'Unk' means 'Unknown': 

Sin and exp At the risk of going on too long, I think it's natural to also address a similar question for the sine and exponential functions. Here is the picture for exp: 

Notes on the software The software computes 500 iterates, and then looks at the next 30 iterates. It returns the minimum $n$ such that there are two successive subsequences of length $n$ whose corresponding terms are within $\varepsilon = .001$. If no such $n$ is found, it computes 500 more iterates and tries again. This is repeated 6 times. If no such $n$ is found, the pixel is colored black. Decreasing $\varepsilon$ by a factor of $10^4$ or so takes longer but does not result in a substantially different picture. 

Do strictly symmetric monoidal topologically-enriched categories model all connective spectra? If your modeling functor is some reasonable variant of the ordinary classifying space functor, I think the answer must be No. What I know for sure about this question is written (with Angélica Osorno) in this paper: Modeling stable one-types. In that paper we study how to model the Postnikov data of spectra with just two nonzero homotopy groups (in dimension 0 and 1). The Postnikov data in such a low-dimensional case consists only of the two (abelian) homotopy groups $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$, together with a Postnikov invariant. Therefore we restrict not only to symmetric monoidal categories, but to those symmetric monoidal categories where all morphisms are invertible and all objects are invertible up to isomorphism. (The standard term for these is "Picard categories", but a more descriptive name would be "grouplike symmetric monoidal groupoids".) The sloganized summary of the paper is that the symmetry of the Picard category is the data which corresponds to the Postnikov invariant of the stable 1-type. (There's a neat connection with the theory of quadratic maps, and some calculations of Eilenberg and Mac Lane from the 1950's, which partially explain why you might expect this.) I'll skip the precise details here -- you can try the paper, or just ask me later. For a specific example, we write down a symmetric monoidal category which models the Postnikov truncation of the zeroth space of the sphere spectrum. It has a strictly associative and unital monoidal structure, but the symmetry is nontrivial.
