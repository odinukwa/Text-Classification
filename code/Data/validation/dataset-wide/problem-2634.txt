This is the theory of the First-Mover in Christian theology, and also of Occaisonalism where God is required everywhere and at all times, it is a different resolution to the paradox of causality that Hume pointed out and Kant answered by making empirical reality mind-dependent. 

Of course Tegmarks speculations are rooted in the concepts of modern physics; but there is here undeniable to my untutored eye a link. He argues: 

The answer that Aristotle have is that being comes from non-being; non-being is not nothing, but merely potentially being; when it is actual, it is being. This theory was prompted by his theory of change and motion, which in turn was prompted by the questions that Parmenides and Zeno uncovered on change and motion. What relevance does this have for contemporary notions of being? Well, our most best accepted theory of matter is QM. And here, what is actual, and therefore graspable, that is measurable, was once potential. To put it in more physically conventional terms: the wave function of a system is a potential which evolves according to a law and collapses randomly on measurement to a value in its spectrum, and this is the actual value measured. 

This is asserting the existence of a potentially infinite set, and not a completed one; it is saying for example, there is the set: 

I'd suggest the relationship is the otherway around. Its well-known that though Philosophy gets results, the results tend to be inconclusive, or rather they lead other natural questions; thus, one finds that truth is elusive. Its the formalisation of this cliche or adage, that Tarski & Godel achieved with their new methods in mathematical logic that showed their methods had broke new ground in this field that made it significant to mathematics and logic. Of course 'paradoxical' results like this had already been discovered by Godel - his incompleteness theorems, and by Russell - the set that doesn't contain itself. It was probably this set results that accelerated the development of analytic philosophy from the positivist doctrine that had arisen from the Vienna Circle. It aligns itself with formal methods, mathematical logic & science and grammar. 

One might go to Plato in answering this question; in his Republic, he elaborated a theory of three political regimes; but real political regimes are not exclusively one or the other, but take a share in all; the preponderance of one character determines what we call it - aristocratic, oligarchic or democratic, or tyrannical. Similarly, for the character of work; every kind of work has a share in labour, as it does in the free play of skill; and the preponderance of one over the other determines what we call it; a great deal of 'grunt-work' ie practise is required for Mozart to become Mozart. 

Indeed can language induce neuroses? One could imagine several interesting but unethical experiments to test this proposition. So, to your questions: 

It appears you're using the word one as a synonym of some thing exists. Implicitly you are not asserting that it is everything - in Aristotles terminology, the All; whose concept includes existence. Hence it must be individualisable - in the sense of being distinguishable from everything else; and this too is part of your concept of one. In this bare sense of one, you are not asserting that it is unique - there may be others - in which case it would be 'one of'; but it also might be the case, that it is in fact unique - ie 'the only one'. Mathematically, one is not bare in this sense; it has a range of meanings: 

So a proposition is that which is common to all signs that express it. This is similar to the idea that 'oneness' is common to 1, one, ein, ek etc. So propositions bear truth - but what is truth for Wittgenstein? He terms it as agreement with the facts of the world or not: 

Substance is that which has no dependent relation on any other; and unlike an atom, is infinitely differentiable - it has parts; and those parts thus distinguished have relations amongst themselves; and are subject to change (Lucretious on atoms: that which has no parts is not subject to change and is permanent). Descarte introduced res cogitans and res extensa which is generally translated as 'thinking substance' and 'extended substance'; but it's in the notion of 'substance' by which dependence is not an possibility - thus from here, directly we have mind/body dualism; in the sense of being entirely distinct and without effect on each other. This goes against what we observe 'clearly and distinctly': mind acting on body - I pick up a stone, and body acting on mind, I duck a stone flung in my direction. Is substance then the correct translation for res? And what how did Descarte himself suggest their dependence? If he did. From item 52 from his Principles: 

And it happened for a reason, the machinary around Grothendiecks work is immense - and that is its main difficulty; for example, the stacks project has written over three thousand pages merely to explicate Grothendicks work fully; this is a formidable amount of work, and one can surely understand the reluctance of number theorists who are happy enough to graze in pastures closer their traditional number-theory land, and munch on lower hanging fruit requiring less work, by less effort. Thus Mochizukis natural constituency has a lot of catching up to do before they even begin to digest his own work; and this takes time. Fesenko ends with an endorsement: 

Which has a parallel with Platos notion of a Philosopher-King. What are the major differences between Aristotles Politics and that of Platos? And how influential is Platos text on him; it already seems here, for example that Aristotle is expanding and examining the notion of the Philosopher-King; perhaps identifying it to some extent with the laws of the city (polis); and those who legislate for them; but he notes: 

Up until this point Rawls had analysed the institutions of society and not individuals; he will now go on to discuss Justice for inividuals but before doing so he commits himself to not discussing the 'natural assets' - that is the talents of a man - seeing them fixed; he won't discuss in depth the possibility of change; this of course is known as Eugenics, and Rawls will have known its implication in the Holocaust (as described by Hannah Arendt in her densely detailed book - Totalitarianism - the science of eugenics was widespread on both sides of the Atlantic); and this is the reason for his silence; his intellectual honesty pushes him to note however that: 

The second is much larger than the first, now reading the number of digits is something that can't be done at a glance, but looking at it geometrically, one can judge that the second is perhaps ten times as long. Practically, one has to consider that large numbers are fairly pointless. There are after all only about a googles worth of particles in the universe. One can write this number down - 1 with a hundred zeroes after it. Most of the time we actually deal with quite small numbers - 6, 30 maybe 500,000. Hence, for most people, for most of the time, a fairly primitive understanding of quantity is all thats required: nothing, one, two, a little and a lot. The picture becoes clearer when we begin to look at cardinal numbers. Here there is no hope of usingphysical imagination, and what one uses is how they function within the body of mathematics, that is by the statements that use it,and are understood by it. In Saussearean terminology we understand it structurally. That is by an element in a whole, and its relations. One could develop from here , I suppose, a structural epistemology of quantity. 

I can't speak for the philosophical content as such; but merely as a native speaker of English with an amateur interest in philosophy. I would suggest that you wouldn't lose much by dropping the 'per se'; here it seems to be acting as a stylistic marker; there is also the hint of a suggestion that it means this sentence, in itself; and without the surrounding context. However, considering: 

A term used in several places in the Upanishads. And also, by opposition; and thinking of advaita; as 'not duality'; or rather 'beyond/before duality' (and by correspondance to Hegels opening on his Logic); I'd speculate that saguna means with all qualities; and this in the phrase 

ie nothing is really said, and thus the world is 'frozen'; and the 'flippant, chummy word contributes to the perpetuation of silence' in this image of affable sociability. 

Infinity for Nietzsche in at least one line of argument involves the eternal return; he refers to it in the Die fr√∂hliche Wissenschaft and Also sprach Zarathustra; most completely in his Notes on the Eternal Recurrence: 

Kant was reacting to two positions - the wholly idealistic philosophy of Berkeley - which is a very rough equivalent to the 'brain in a vat' thought experiment which is more akin to classical solipsism - in which everything is mind and objective reality disappears, and the radical scepticism of Hume which totally undermined the basis for empirical science - essentially the idea of causality. The phenomenal world as we know it and sense it immediately is structured by the the intuition giving it space & time to be presented to the intellectual & reasoning faculties of the mind - the understanding. (Think of a photograph, it is actually flat, but the mind projects an illusion of space; think of reading a novel, we give the illusion of time to the protagonists in it, a (narrative) time that is entirely separate from the flow of time we are as we are reading it). The world in-itself (noumena) is never accessible - but it exists - otherwise we won't see its representation as phenomena. So Kant finds a middle ground where mind & intuition meet reality and each is immanent in the other. This allows science to happen, as it must; and leaves solipsism still fighting a lost battle. 

This is undoubtably true; simply because of the commerce of civilisations means also the commerce of ideas; Diogenes Laertius specifically had to rebut non-Greek roots of Philosophy in his book The Lives of Philosophers; and one notices the very strong influence of the presocratics on Plato, almost all that lived in and around the mediterranean coast. Jay Garfield, a Western Philosopher wrote: 

Emptiness, or sunyata, is roughly not to have svabhava, existence that is its own ground. Dignana, the Buddhist logician, given dependent arising, inferred that atoms must be momentary: they come to be - are - and pass away; this is unlike the atomism of Democritus, where atoms are permanent. Intriguingly this does rather sound like the virtual particle swarms in QFT...! Free will is a Western concept; and Kant, I take it, fits it somehow into his architecture of the self - but I'm not sure of the details; perhaps some scholar knowing Kant more, may come along and fill in this sketch. I'm not sure, either, how it fits into Buddhist notions of the self. 

Athiesm isn't scientific, it was Laplace that introduced it into the scientific-philosophical-theological conception pictured by Newton, by pointing out that his conception did not appear to require a creator God. Newton himself devoted much more time to theology than he ever did to physics. Also not the final paragraphs in this essay, More is Different by P.W.Anderson, a Chemist: 

A few other people have noticed this. Karl Jaspers calls it the axial age when he says that several civilisations laid down the spiritual foundations of humanity. One should note I think that the phenomena is restricted to the Eurasian continent. 

I don't know if the following answers your question; but you might find it might throw some light on it. Heidegger in an interview in Spiegel, published in '76 said the following: 

Hegel, in the preface of the phenomenology calls the concept of mathematics, magnitude; what would the concept of physics? The Res Extensa of Descartes and Spinoza? But Liebniz, in an *Essay on Dynamics says:
