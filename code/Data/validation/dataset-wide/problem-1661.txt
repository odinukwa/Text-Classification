A came across this article on addictinginfo.org. It quotes from this article in the Scotland Herald, describing Accelerated Christian Education in Louisiana. I quote: 

No, IPCC did not obfuscate evidence. The early draft version of the graph was flawed. That's why it was in an early draft and has been removed subsequently. This question has been adressed in an article at skepticalscience.com, which draws mainly from an excellent blog post by climate blogger and statistician Grant Foster (a.k.a. Tamino). Quoting from the skepticalscience article, which in turn quotes from the blog-post: 

Evidence seems thin. The health research cited at Nagoya covers only hearth rate and endurance, which may not be the only potential effect. Is there any independent evidence that there is any beneficial effect to humans of any kind to drinks with extra oxygen added — apart from placebo effects and effects on corporate profits? 

The Guardian has the exact same quote, as do many others. Although the claim does not appear to be explicitly challenged, Livingstone was suspended from the Labour-party for “anti-semitism”, which does imply that his remark was considered controversial within the Labour Party. Is it accurate and fair to say that Hitler (at one point) supported Zionism? 

The full paper, entitled Private provision of public goods in a second-best world: cap and trade schemes limit green consumerism, by Dr Grischa Perino will be published by the Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science on Wednesday, January 30. As far as I can see, it does not appear to be peer-reviewed. An blog post by Leo Hickman on The Guardian website responds: Should we stop worrying about the environmental impact of flying?. Hickman writes: Perino appears to adopt a theoretical, idealised vision of the ETS, one that doesn't account for the system's very real flaws, not least its vulnerability to turbulence caused by vested interests and political pressure.. Other economists and anti-aviation activists by Hickman do not really contest the point. He does quote Chris Goodall as saying: 

The Wikipedia article Human rights in Saudi Arabia#Women's rights cites an article from The Peninsula. The article is no longer available, but the claims Wikipedia sources thus are (emphasis mine): 

With more than 50 casualties, only the September 11 attacks (islamists) and the Oklahoma City bombing (unaffiliated individuals) qualify. Looking deeper at some recent examples that included fatalities: 

Milošević was never convicted, because he died before the trial was concluded. That means he certainly wasn't exonerated in the literal sense. Rather, the Karadžić judgement states on page 1303: 

There is no evidence for these extraordinary claims. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. In particular, flying alongside a satellite does not mean one can read off their instruments; satellites do not have dials and instruments to be read by a person next to the satellite, so the “evidence” provided does not make sense. There are rational explanations for out-of-body experiences, and can in some cases be actively induced, according to a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine: 

According to Ken Livingstone (UK Labour politician, former Mayor of London), Hitler supported Zionism: Evening Standard: 

(Edit: literally speaking, this question is true if there are at least two people for whom it is true. It may be implied that Mr. Holloway MP considers this to be somewhat typical. I prefer answers addressing the implication, i.e. that this is not exceptional, but answers focussing on individual cases are also welcome.) 

According to factslides, a reddit post, Wikipedia, and the Wall Street Journal, the Diary of Anne Frank is banned in Lebanon. According to a reddit comment this is "rubbish". Other news reports a single private school in Lebanon removing references to Anne Frank (Ynetnews, Huffington post), which implies it is not banned nationally, unless the situation has changed. It may also explain the origin of incorrect claims for a national ban. Is the sale, possession, and/or import of the Diary of Anne Frank banned in Lebanon? Edit: I realised it might be that there exists a ban de jure, but that it is unenforced and widely ignored. 

So it appears that the chamber states there is not sufficient evidence that Milošević agreed with Karadžić plans in Bosnia. However, it also states that Milošević at the same time provided assistance to the Bosnian Serbs. Therefore, other claims in the linked article, such as that Milošević was trying to stop those war crimes, are not supported by the provided evidence from the Karadžić judgement. 

When a significant amount of travellers decide to take the train rather than the flight, inside the EU, I would expect this to reduce carbon emissions, because there are less flights. But is this true in practice? 

It probably makes no difference. Gender-segregated schools still exist in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, Korea, and some other countries. Therefore, it is possible to study whether either works better in reality. A comprehensive meta-analysis published in 2014 analysed 184 studies, and concluded that it is unlikely that single-sex education offers any advantages or disadvantages for either gender. The study covered primary and secondary education. “The Effects of Single-Sex Compared With Coeducational Schooling on Students’ Performance and Attitudes: A Meta-Analysis,” Erin Pahlke, PhD, Whitman College; Janet Shibley Hyde, PhD, and Carlie M. Allison, MS, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Psychological Bulletin, online Feb. 3, 2014. In: Psychological Bulletin, doi:10.1037/a0035740. Available online. See also press release by the American Psychological Association, from which I quote (emphasis mine): 

For reference, Wikipedia has a List of IARC Group 2A carcinogenics. It is weaker than Group 1 (Carcinogenic to humans), but stronger than Group 2B (Possibly carcinogenic to humans). However, according to Monsanto and other agrochemical companies, the methodology of the IARC study is poor and the conclusions invalid. The article classifying glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans: Guyton, K. Z. et al. Lancet Oncol. $URL$ (2015). A Nature article reporting on the news, as well as reporting on criticism from Monsanto and others: Widely used herbicide linked to cancer, Nature, March 2015, doi:10.1038/nature.2015.17181 

These claims appear to be well-sourced with links to research, from blog posts such as this one and this one. Blog posts themselves are, of course, not peer-reviewed, but it does appear to contain a lot of links to peer reviewed science. Do the claims by Susan Crockford and others make sense? Is there substantial evidence to support the claim that polar bears are doing well despite a decline in sea ice? Or is the evidence solid that sea ice decline does substantially theaten the survival of polar bears? For reference, IPCC AR5 WG2, Section 28.3.2.2.2 (PDF, 7.0 MiB, 46 pages) states that projected extinction of polar bears is unlikely, so I'm not entirely sure to what extent the claims by Susan Crockford are in disagreement with scientific consensus as collected by IPCC, which is surprisingly short on polar bears. 

Depending on sources, the number of professional firefighters + law enforcement officers is either the same or slightly smaller than the number of professional tax preparers. However, if we include part-time or amateur firefighters, the claim is false. From Face the Facts USA, A Project of the George Washington University, comes the claim with sources (see below). Evidently, they define tax preparers as those who make a living helping taxpayers deciphering US tax code. Likewise, the number only considers professional firefighters. Note that this is not peer-reviewed research, but rather has the nature of a blog, even though it's run by a university, it should be considered with some care. However, all the numbers are directly sourced to the U.S. Federal Government.
