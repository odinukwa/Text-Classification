There is no rule about that the pitch has to maintain some aspect. in fact a field can be 90m X 45m or 90m X 89m, but the last one would be a very strange field. 

Usually what is call a friendly match is a game outside a tournament. Like in many other sports, this kind of game is usually used as a test for both team. Usually in this kind of game, although all the rule book is used, sometimes there are a relax in some rules, like quantity of substitutes, and many times both team plays in a relaxed way, and the refeere usually don´t show as many yellow and red cards. Some games, like the ones that are the last one for a player, includes several more relaxed rules, like the player playing for both team, or an unlimited number of replacement players. The last one are usually not call friendly match, are better know as tribute match. 

Well.. Any answer here could be a little subjetive about this. I would start saying that even if you understand the game, that doesn't mean that your body will do what your head wants to do. The other factor is practice. When you are a young boy, your body learns movements a lot better that when you are growing. that's why players usually are young people. It's very hard to learn how to move your body while you are growing up. The best you can do at this point, is do a lot of drills on passing, movements and shots. You will not learn in the course of a game, at least not without help. The other thing you need is a coach (any type, even a friend that do the things in a right way), it can help you pointing out flaws he see, or at least showing you how to do particular things. But even if you do all that things, there is a chance that your play never gets better. There are a lot of cases where coach where not great players, and great players are horrible coach (just see maradona coaching). also, besides 5 a side soccer can make you go attacking and defending, start playing only one position until you get a better aproach on it. 

The NFL started allowing two wildcard teams per conference to enter the playoffs in the 1978-79 season, and went to three wildcard teams in 1990-91. With only three divisions per conference, it was quite common to have three teams from one division in the playoffs. There were even two instances where there were four teams from the NFC Central division in the playoffs, in 1994-95 and 1997-98. However, when the league went to four divisions and only two wildcard teams per conference in the 2002-03 season, this became somewhat less common. Since going to the current division/playoff format, it has happened 7 times: 

Watching the home run ball is considered poor sportsmanship. For a pitcher, giving up a home run is the worst mistake you can make. And, right or wrong, many pitchers see it as an insult and get very angry when they have just given up a homer and the batter stops and stares at it. Sometimes they will be so angry that there will be retaliation against the batter, such as a hit-by-pitch on his next time up. Fans, in general, don’t understand this. They like seeing celebrations in pro sports, whether it’s a touchdown dance or a slow victory lap after a home run. But the players often don’t feel the same way. Fox Sports ran a column explaining the players’ thinking. (Unfortunately, I can’t figure out who the author is.): 

The par for a hole is primarily based on the length of the hole, but other factors can also affect its value; most noticeably the type of terrain and any potential obstacles (water, hills, buildings etc). Wikipedia article for Par The USGA lays out the following guidelines for par computation; 

The 5th and 6th officials (if that's what they're called) that run the goal line in Euro 2012 can be seen holding "wands" in their hands; 

Being extremely interested in this myself, I used data taken from the English 2010-2011 season in the Premier League, Championship and divisions 1 and 2, to compile the following statistics; 

It is Kinesio Tape, which is an adhesive-tape that is applied to problematic muscles. Problematic as in, the muscles are weak after returning from injury (you can support them using Kinesio tape), or you can apply it to aching muscles to sooth the pain. It's application can also increase blood flow to the muscles, and speed up the recovery process. Specifically to Mario, no-one knows the exact reason he's using it. Here's an article which explains the science behind it (beyond me :P). 

These codes refer to the draw size of various aspects of the tournaments. For each category of the tournament, the number of participants in the main draw (the main tournament) is listed. 

The term "Grand Slam" is used often in various sports to refer to a specific difficult achievement in that sport. If I'm not mistaken, its use in contract bridge is the original use of the term. Occasionally, the term "small slam" is used in sports; for example, the Winston Million prize in NASCAR, which awarded a $1 Million prize for winning three out of the four major races, which they called a small slam. I've never heard of the term "small slam" being used in baseball, but I would think that it could be applied to any situation where someone is "one" short of achieving a grand slam. 

What are the differences between these different events? I know that the number and spacing of the gates are different. Is that all it is, or is there more to it than that? 

According to what I get on the golf course, the pre-shot routine prepare your body for the upcoming sequence of movements. Golf teachers usually teach you to get the feeling for the next shoot until you fell comfortable, and this become a routine in every shoot. Usually when you are about to shoot, your mind can play a lot of tricks on you (and more tricks if you are in front of water :P ). Making some practice swings should make your more confident on the shoot, and also will let you focus on your objective, since your body should remember the feeling of the shoot you want to make. It's like telling your body how you want to do the shoot. Usually the pre-shot are slower, you can see it clearly easy on professionals. Also take in mind that a routine makes you more confident about what are you going to do. I will add that usually a lot of sports has pre something routine (in tennis you see the players do always the same before serve). 

Unless the player is injured, the player could physically get up on their own; if they couldn't, there is no way they would be in physical shape enough to play the game. Nearly every play in football, however, ends with someone laying down on the field. At the end of the play, the players still standing typically offer a hand to help the ones that are down, even if they are on the other team. The reasons other players will lend a hand to help other players up are professionalism, courtesy, sportsmanship (for the players on the other team), and teamwork (for the players on his own team). When a player helps someone up that they have just tackled, it is acknowledgement that they are both professionals doing a job, and that there are no hard feelings. Most professional players understand that, although they play on different teams, they are all coworkers, in a sense, and that your opponent this year might be your teammate next year. That having been said, sometimes, especially in basketball, there is something else going on. Again, as with football, if a basketball player truly cannot get up off the floor on their own, they are not well enough to continue to play the game. Unfortunately, you sometimes see an element of theatrics in basketball. The player is trying to show that they have been fouled, and so they act hurt. They'll wave for help to try to draw sympathy, and then they will slam dunk the next ball they get. Basketball doesn't seem to have the "iron-man," "shake-it-off," "tough guy" culture that football has. 

They are no more rules, only the FIFA ones. I was searching, but only find links in spanish about it. But all is way back to 2006, when there was a big change in the laws of the game and in the interpretation. Before that, you couldn't touch the goalie inside the goal box. Now, you can, if you don't commit any other type of foul in the same play, and you can't do it with excesive force. The problem with clamping the ball, if that you are impeding your adversary from playing it, since any movement he make would be a dangerous move to yourself. All I could find, was old newspaper news, in which some referees tell about it, but couldn't find a better source. this, this and this All in spanish, sorry! 

According to this on line newspaper (that has his corresponding real version), the record is holded by a team with 7 penalties (but it doesn't said in how many matches). But it has info about this team, Talleres de cordoba, who in 1952 has 6 penalties in 5 consecutives matches. 

Firstly, it would be rare for such a tackle to be performed; it's bad for a defender to commit themselves like that. Especially at a higher level, oppenents will be able to read your actions and trivially side-step your tackle; they're then through on goal, and you won't be able to support your defence in time. Providing I'm reading your scenario right, then it shouldn't be judged as a foul. You'll get the ball first, it isn't a tackle from behind; so, providing it was otherwise a legitimate slide (feet weren't high, studs weren't showing, it wasn't a lunge, you don't go through the player), I can't see the referee giving a foul for it. As for the striker getting injured; I doubt it. It won't catch the striker by suprise per-sec, but just late enough so they can't navigate themselves out of the situation with the ball. They'll still see the tackle arriving, and will be able to catch themselves with their arms, roll off the tackle, or even step/ jump over you. 

The size of the picth is not evenly in every field. There are maximum and minimun size. told us about it: Dimensions The touchline must be longer than the goal-line. Length (touchline): minimum 90m (100yds) maximum 120m (130yds) Length (goal-line): minimum 45m (50yds) maximum 90m (100yds) Dimensions for international matches Length (touchline): minimum 100m (100yds) maximum 110m (120yds) Length (goal-line): minimum 64m (70yds) maximum 75m (80yds) Competitions may determine the length of the goal-line and touchline within the above dimensions. 

Futsal is a very "quick" sport. Usually players has to run a lot (like in basketball). That's why this kind of sports has a big rotation of players on the field. If you are playing friendly, the last defender could be a nice position, only covering your own half and helping attacking from the center of the field. If you need a rest, being a goalkeeper is the easiest position to rest, since you barely leave the penalty area. That's always depends on the type of game you are playing. If you are playing in a league, you will have to make sure your teammates doesn't fill all the positions you can handle. Or make sure that the team has replacement players. If you have a good goalkeeper (this position needs a lot of reflex, the ball in this game goes very fast), then stick to be the last defender. And start training to regain your fitness. 

As I was watching Green Bay beat up on Carolina today, I saw a Papa John's Pizza ad featuring Troy Aikman. During the commercial, they show a closeup on his hand, bejeweled with his championship rings: 

As you can see, he wore many numbers over his sports career. As far as I have been able to tell, he had never worn number 42 before he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the number was probably just assigned to him by the team. 

Basically, this means that you cannot pin (stop) the ball at your five-man rod, then pass it to your three-man rod. To get around this, if you have the ball stopped on your five-rod, you can either pass the ball back to your defense, or you can bounce the ball off the wall before advancing it. However, you can't keep bouncing the ball off the wall over and over. Rule 23.2 covers this: 

I'm going to say that this scenario isn't possible. Let's consider a team that is trying to make the playoffs. They have two shots: the division title, and the wildcard spots. Both of these are based on the team's total record for all 16 games in the season. It is only when these 16-game records are tied that the tie breakers are considered. It is certainly possible that a team can be in a scenario where they know that a win in the last game does not help them, because they know that they will lose a tie breaker. However, losing the game cannot help them. Why? Because if they lose, they have a worse record than if they won. If they are in a three-way tie with a loss, then with a win they would have beaten both of those teams without the tie breaker. You might think that there could be a scenario where you need a certain team to win, and the team that they are playing happens to be you. I don't think this type of scenario is possible: whenever you need to hope that a certain team wins for your playoff hopes to stay alive, it is really because you need that team's opponent to lose. 

The number of laps in a F1 race seem to differ wildly. Obviously the length of each lap varies from circuit to circuit, but how are the number of laps for each race decided? Additionally, is this number chosen by the owners of the race track, or something decided by the FIA/ teams? 

Often you hear about the team whose ground the match is being played at having a "home advantage". During a discussion with a friend they said teams go as far as to style the opposing teams changing room to play mind games; i.e. making the room layout hard for discussion, and the colour scheme being dull so as to lower any motivation. Personally I thought this was a bit too far (sportsmanship anyone?), but I was curious as to what actually contributes to a home advantage? Additionally, does anyone know of any studies/ statistics which can prove whether the home advantage is merely a myth, or is a real thing?
