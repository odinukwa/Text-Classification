There is philosophy, mathematical logic, and English language... And they don't agree. In the triangle question, to avoid endless discussions, I wouldn't see "100 degrees". I'd say "In any triangle with sides 1cm, 10cm and 100cm, the sum of angles is 100 degrees" or better yet "there is no triangle with sides 1cm, 10cm and 100cm where the sum of angles isn't 100 degrees". The last one is beyond discussion in philosophy, mathematical logic, and plain English. Is the current king of France bald? In the English language, this is both a claim and a question. The claim is "there is exactly one person who is currently king of France". And the question: "Is the unique person who is currently king of France bald?". The correct reply is to state that the claim is wrong and the question therefore doesn't make sense. You could also say "If there was a current king of France then he would be bald" and you could just as well say "If there was a current king of France then you would have immense hair" or "nobody with hair on his head is the current king of France". 

To be frank, that is slashdot, and most articles there are idiotic. They claim that there is a dilemma, but it doesn't exist. The goal of creating a self driving car is to make it safe. To avoid all collisions. The scenarios described do NOT happen. Nobody, ever, in the worlds history, has been in a situation where they had the choice between killing themselves in an accident or killing ten pedestrians. And the chances are ten times slimmer in a self driving car that is programmed to drive carefully and avoids a situation like that. If you think otherwise, post a link to a case. But since you are posting on philosophy, you should have thought a bit more about this. This isn't about you deciding whether to die to save ten lives. It's about making a decision how cars should be built. Let's say the whole situation happens X times. There are X drivers, and 10X pedestrians. If you are ever involved in the situation, then it is ten times more likely that you are among the pedestrians. So it is in your own best selfish interest that in this kind of situation one driver should die and not ten pedestrians, because that kind of design makes it ten times more likely that you survive. In addition, drivers in a car are very well protected. Especially in a self driving car that would predict the accident and can optimally control seat belt, airbag and so on and can optimally slow down. Now you might try to modify the computer of your car. That has three problems: One, you don't have the slightest chance to pull this off. Two, if you pull it off and ten people die, you are going to jail for a very long time. Three, if my wife is among the victims, I'd make you wish you had died instead. Dave: Your maths is wrong. It doesn't matter how often you drive and how rare it is that you are a pedestrian. If people never walk then the number X of accidents in the equation is small. Maybe very small. It doesn't change the fact that you are ten times more likely to be the pedestrian in such an accident. Maybe the one time in summer when the wheather was beautiful and you ate a bit too much and decided to have a walk, or the one time when your car broke down and you had to walk, you can't get around maths. Isaacson: Please think about it and please think very very hard before you tell me my math is wrong. In every single situation where there would be a choice between one driver dying or ten pedestrians dying, there will be ten times as many pedestrians involved. If nobody ever walks, then clearly there is no chance to ever run into ten pedestrians! And the whole argument is about general rules, not individual cases. 

Take this example: People wearing rain coats, people carrying umbrellas, and rain fall. These three will tend to happen together, or to not happen together. This is correlation. There are three main cases for causality: The relation between rain and umbrellas is causal. When it rains people get their umbrellas out. There is no causal relationship in the other direction: Carrying an umbrella doesn't cause rain to happen. If you put away your umbrella during the rain, that won't make the rain stop. And the relationship between rain coats and umbrellas is different again: They both have a common cause. Note that correlation works in both directions: Rain is correlated with umbrellas, and umbrellas are equally correlated with rain. Causality usually is a one-way relationship. 

We are usually talking about the "ad hominem fallacy": Claiming something about the person making an argument doesn't make the argument right or wrong, and assuming it does is a fallacy. It's not a fallacy if you don't make any claims about the argument. "I hate X and there is no way I do what they propose, whether it's right or wrong". You made no claim about any statement or argument by X. You just hate X. That's not a fallacy. Of course what Person 3 says is an "ad hominem attack". Which doesn't make it a fallacy. When Person 3 says "I can't take him seriously because...", well, you can decide if that is enough of a serious (fallacious) argument to call it an "ad hominem fallacy" or not. If you are discussing fashion then "I can't take him serious because he is ugly" is surely an ad hominem fallacy. If you are discussing physics, then I would say that statement is so much nonsense that it isn't even worth being called a "fallacy". 

I think you have this upside down. No evidence is needed that there is no "afterlife". The possibility that there could be anything after death is an outrageous statement that would need either very, very strong evidence, or a few million supporters, preferably heavily armed (the second is how this myth survived for so long). If I take your argument correctly, then you think yourself that it is possible that the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists, since nobody has every seen any evidence against it. 

"Unused processor time" equals "non-wasted electricty". A computer is a machine that turns electrical power into computations. This kind of donation has a strong negative impact on the environment. And it is likely that your computer at home is not the most efficient at turning power into computations. It is quite likely that a project using computational power that it isn't paying for is therefore quite inefficient at using that power, since there is no reason to improve efficiency. Projects that have to pay for computational power are likely to make better use of it. The argument that the amount of power used would be trivial is absolutely wrong. As an example, some laptops are designed to run 10 hours on a 60 Wh battery charge, but can draw easily 60 Watts of power running at full speed. Asking for ethical decisions while supplying incorrect information is highly unethical. 

The reply: The truth is that your religion is rubbish. That's the truth. I'm not denying it at all. But what about you? Do you accept the truth that your religion is rubbish? If not, then quite evidently you were just projecting: You are denying the truth that your religion is rubbish but will eventually admit the truth. 

There is a junction near my home that had a few accidents. A sufficient condition for preventing these accidents is to completely remove the junction and all roads around it in a 10 mile radius. I hope you agree that this sufficient condition is not a good solution to the problem. The approach of trying to prevent a phenomenon is usually suboptimal. We are probably guided by the fact that then phenomenon has a cost that we want to avoid, but preventing the phenomenon also has a cost. Instead we should use an approach where we reduce the cost of the phenomenon with a low cost for achieving that reduction. It may even happen if we already spend money on prevention, that spending a lot less on prevention will cause only a slight increase in the cost of the phenomenon, so we should do less to prevent it. Trying to completely prevent a phenomenon is usually excessively expensive. "Murder" is a phenomenon that we would like to prevent. Try imagining what measures you would have to take to absolutely 100% prevent any murder in your country. Then consider that according to Christian mythology, person #3 murdered person #4 and you'll figure out that your measures are probably not sufficient. (Persons in that order: Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel). (This also should give you some thoughts for "necessary conditions". What necessary conditions would there be for murder? You might say "two living people" are a necessary condition for murder, but not even that is true because a person can set events in motion that will kill another person, and then take their own life). 

If you hear a nice paradox like "this sentence is wrong" for the first time, you think "well, if this sentence is correct, then it is wrong because that's what it says". Then you think "But if the sentence is wrong then it is correct". (You can argue this two different ways: If the sentence is wrong, then its statement "this sentence is wrong" agrees with reality, so the sentence is correct. The other way: If the sentence is wrong that means it's statement "this sentence is wrong" is wrong. Since "this sentence is wrong" is wrong, the opposite "this sentence is correct" is correct). Now you can start with the same argument again. But you are not going to do this infinitely, because one of two things happen: Either you figure out that after two steps of the argument you come back to the original, so you end up saying: "'This sentence is wrong' is a very strange sentence, because whether I assume it's right or wrong, I always conclude the opposite". Or you don't figure it out, but you get bored with the whole situation, and you say "This is too difficult for me, I've had enough of it, I'll think about something else". Anyone trying to create a high-powered artificial intelligence would be aware of this and make sure that in difficult cases the AI doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop but either detects that there is a loop, or just gives up. Same as a human would do. So asking such an AI "is the sentence 'this sentence is wrong' right or wrong" wouldn't result in a smoking pile of metal containing a former AI, it would result in a quick answer "This is a paradox, because whatever I assume leads to the opposite" or a slower answer "I thought about it very hard for five seconds, and I can't figure it out". (What would be hard is to decide when the AI should give up. This sentence looks easy enough, so you could think that if the AI can't figure it out in five seconds, it never will. But if you ask an AI to figure out a way to solve the problem of food supplies in third world countries, that's a hard problem, where finding a solution is expected to take a long time, so the AI should be allowed or allow itself to think about it for a very long time).
