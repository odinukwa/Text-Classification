He angered the bank but pleased the king (securing and extending an important transport route, defending against future assaults from the river) and merchants (low tax). Investing the income into building his castle step by step is the feasible way to go. It's unlikely he gets any credit after the stunt he pulled on the bank. As an alternative, agree with the bank to finish the new bridge after their claim expired. This will keep them happy and taxes up. However it will attract less merchants. 

I'm going to go a different direction and say don't let the people know that the 1% are going to be escaping this hell-hole of a planet. Lets start with how do we keep the thing a secret while designing it? Don't let anyone know what's it's true intention is. No one below UltraProject Director needs to be aware that the people on this vessel will not be returning to new Venus. If anyone starts to question what the thing is for, you can offer them a place on your ship; after all if they know about it, they're probably a good person to have on board. If they want to "spread the truth", then kill them. They were already doomed anyway, you're just advancing the time table. Kill their family too for good measure. Reducing living family members to zero also reduces the chances of media inquiry, and again, these people were already dead anyway... Now, about who we populate this station with. Surely the great thinkers (or at least the highest elected politicians) are reasonably assured a place, as well as few "minor" dignitaries from the third world who we don't vehemently disagree with, all for the sake of appearing diverse. Our families need to have boarding rights too. The surviving laborers who created the ark should come along to, because routine maintenance and custodial work will need to be done. The Engineers and Scientists need to come, probably several astronomers, physicians, doctors, and computer scientists. Celebrities and media personalities (including celebrity scientists, sorry but Tyson and Nye aren't coming) won't be invited, because we don't want word to spread. Finally, the venture capitalists who invested in this business will come, because they invested in it to finance the building of the thing. They may find their new positions as fry cooks and grill line workers a little bit less glamorous, but that's just how things are on the ARK, we all have a part to play, my part is deciding what functions are useful and who boards, your position is fulfilling the utility you are assigned as payment for boarding. 

After the depression, there was a number of initiatives to change the economy and some of them gained a foothold. Some of those ideas included really low interest rate ceilings to, in some cases, complete abolition of interest. However, this eliminated or greatly reduced the income of traditional banks. As the economy still needs the services they provide, is feasible that, in case of necessity, most countries would assume these service themselves, in the way of national banks maintained by a mix of public money and fees. I am aware that there is non-interest based banking, like the Muslim banks and the profit-and-loss-sharing (PLS) paradigm they use, but that is a relatively new thing for banks (in the sense it appeared later than the period I'm using). In this world that role would be covered by private investors (individual or companies). Would, in this scenario, still make sense the existence of private banks? If they still existed, what would be their sources of income? 

Reread your story, and it sounds a lot like the climate debate, which is obstructed by approximately 1/2 of the United States. With such a "far off" and possibly "based in science fiction" problem, you're not gonna get any action. 

If you're working in a high radiation environment, it's likely that there is going to be strong EM interference. While we commonly think of radioactive waste giving off Ionizing radiation, they also give off other types of radiation as well (RTG's rely on this). There may just be too much interference in the environment that these robots exist to rely on radio communication. 

Finding out the claims does not need to be easy. There's no central register. Any close city might have something in their records but a written contract in some private drawer might be lurking around, too. In medieval times credits were usually paid back by nobles in terms of "royalties" (pun likely not coincidental but etymological). The noble got money now in exchange for lending his rights at something later like a source of tax income for a certain amount of time. This means the bridge as a tax source might be lend off to a rich family (the forerunner of banks) only to fall back to him after the time agreed in advance expires. The bank gambles on the income in the near future. They will calculate carefully to make sure they'll get their share. This might already be the case. If so, the bank has a strong but time-limited claim. If not, any other claim (by other lords) can be circumvented: The knight should address the king with concerns about the state and load of the bridge. He proposes to reduce the load on the already run-down (even if it's not) bridge to allow for repairs, if he gets in writing the right for taxing any new and old bridge located once the length from his island to the capital downstream and twice upstream (supposing the capital is located upstream, otherwise vice versa) regardless of previous arrangements. If he's able to get that, he has royal decree that nullifies any claims and ensures he will always have the closest bridge to the capital. Plus he doesn't need to repair the old bridge, because he only assured to allow for not actually pay for repairs on his own. Next he gets a credit lending out tax rights on the old bridge. The bank is bound to ask for the use of the money: "Constructions, I want to invest in my land to make it prosper by attracting more trade." The bank will likely agree, because more trade means more income from the bridge, which they will get. Now the old bridge isn't of any concern for him. He already got a fixed share of the money beforehand. If there are any claims: Sort them out with the bank yourself! He invests the money into building a new bridge. The bank will be pissed, because he'll be cutting their tax income with the new bridge: "But I said I'll invest in constructions!" With the two concurrent bridges, tax will be low attracting many merchants. The knight can increase the tax, as soon as the old bridge falls back to him. In case there are strong claims over the old bridge, he can also sabotage it. He should only do so after the bank's claim expired. No need to anger them too much. Now for water rights: He can have some bandits coming along the river. Attracting bandits shouldn't be too hard. If everything else fails, have some loyal men play them. The bandits anger the king a little. And the knight reports his watch saw a boat escape along the river around that time. However he was unable to do anything and still is, unless he's allowed to deploy some chains across the river to stop and check travelers. This should clarify water rights right away. Now the Knight owns two sources of income: 

So there is a conspiracy going on, attempting to prove this "Threat" is real, and that we should start paying these science types more mind. 

North Korea has been a problem child in the world-at-large for longer than most of the world has been alive. The DMZ is one of the largest permanent military operations in the world, and every act made by the nation is scrutinized thoroughly and treated with the utmost suspicion. A sort of prejudice against any action taken by N. Korea has formed in the world consciousness. Tomorrow, Kim-Jong Al* usurps Kim-Jong Un in a violent takeover because he's sick of seeing his people in a famine state, he's sick of his people being denigrated, and he's sick of constantly wondering if eagleland will get sick of his nations antics and use nuclear weapons to make South Korea an island; but most of all, he's sick of the embargo that keeps him from upgrading from iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6s. Given the current hostility towards anything North Korean, what would he have to do, and what would the world have to do, in order to bring North Korea gracefully into the world economy? At this point it seems like the mistrust would run too deep to gracefully let the nation become a world player. *A fictional "Second Prince" to Kim-Jong Un if you will 

A possible issue with this type of society could be apathy and boredom. A society where all problems are solved or easily solvable can result on the loss of some of the main driving forces in human behaviour, be it ambition, curiosity, etc. This could degenerate in a situation where many humans could gradually lose the will to live or act, living just by inertia, and producing a huge raise in the number of suicides. The Matrix universe explores this concept in the paradise matrix. 

These machines are cool, but also very expensive. The primary benefit is of course the same benefit that humans and other legged creatures have over tanks -- They can easily maneuver over rugged terrain that treads could not be able to deal with. That being said, in a world with aircraft (Although b.Lorenz points out not all celestial bodies have an atmosphere capable of supporting aircraft), there is no real reason to go with n-pedal tanks. If you really are interested though in such a device, I suggest you look at Boston Dynamics new Hybrid robot, and compare it to some of their previous inventions like the Big Dog. By using a creature with knees, but using wheels instead of feet, the hybrid has the advantages of a bipedal locomotion, while eschewing the complexity of multi-jointed ankles. 

I'd like to join the chorus but if everyone does, things get boring, so I choose not to: Your knight got screwed. He has a small island but no "anchor points" on either side of the river. The existing bridge likely already has an owner (There are other lords on either river bank, right?) who will be displeased to have the bridge taken away. The king promised "the new lord will be able to collect plenty of taxes" probably without ensuring to keep it. After all, he said nothing about water rights. Well that's politics. However his situation is not too bad, if he's clever (and a bit ruthless) First he needs to find out the status of the bridge. 

Who cares, without a majority of scientists agreement, it's probably just a bad study. No one can model what's happening in our atmosphere, it's just too big. 

Something that might be considered -- Slightly improper reassembly -- On the order of a few cells per transport would die because something wasn't put back where it was supposed to be. I might not notice it on my test subjects, say, an apple or a squirrel. I might not even notice it past human trials. This wouldn't really affect regular cells, most of them get replaced fairly quickly; however brain cells don't. If I transported to work every day for forty years though, my brain might be ever so slightly less robust than it would have been otherwise. You can scale the inaccuracy if you so desire. 

Banks provide many services to the economy, including but not restricted to: liquidity, a safe place to store money, and the ability to move money around and paying bills without having to cart around loads of cash. In turn, Banks make benefits thanks to the interest generated by the money they move, and, to a lesser extent, to the fees they charge for providing those services. Now we assume a world similar to ours in the fist half of the 20th century, the years after the great depression, with the following differences, if they matter:
