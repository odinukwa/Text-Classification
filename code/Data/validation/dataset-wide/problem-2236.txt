As with a lot of things, historical reasons. The home nations created the rules for association football (the IFAB was founded by the home nations in the 1880s) and haven't yet given up that power. There isn't a deeper reason as to "why" - inertia is a powerful thing, and until there's an actual practical issue it's not worth anybody kicking up a fuss. 

Wides are considered in test matches (and all other cricket) - however, the criteria for a wide in first class cricket and much looser than in one-day cricket; principally the ball has to be much wider than it does in one-day cricket. For a famous example, see Steve Harmison's first ball of the 2006/7 Ashes series. 

It's a consequence of signing bonuses and the salary cap maths. Due to the non-guaranteed nature of contracts, NFL contracts are split into two parts: an annual salary, payable if the player is on the roster that year, and a "signing bonus" which is paid up front. For example, a 5 year, $15 million contract could be broken up as a $2 million annual salary and a $5 million signing bonus. For cap purposes, the signing bonus is prorated over the length of the contract, so that $15 million contract would have an annual cap charge of $3 million as you might expect. The complication comes if a team decides to cut a player - in that case, the annual salary comes off the books, but whatever hasn't already been accounted from the signing bonus counts against the cap in that year. For example, if the team decided to cut our $15M player just before the fourth year of his contract, the "cap charge" for that player would be $2M for the bits of the signing bonus that got prorated into years 4 and 5 of the contract. However, they get nothing for that $2M (because they've cut the player!) hence "dead money". 

Reference: Rule 21 of the Official Volleyball Rules 2013-2016. Note that there is no requirement for a player to necessarily go through all the sanctioning levels - for example, if a player argues in a way such that the referee deems their conduct to be offensive ("defamatory or insulting words or gestures or any action expressing contempt."), then the player will be expelled from the set even if they haven't received any of the less severe sanctions. 

Without wanting to seem too harsh: you don't sound like someone who I'd want as a playing partner. When I'm playing sport, I'm there primarily because I enjoy it - and I don't enjoy doing things in complete silence, never saying a word. I simply wouldn't play with someone who insisted on no comments while playing. Equally, my experience is that this applies to the vast majority of people I've played sport with. Therefore I suggest that if you want to play in silence, then you need to find like-minded people, not try and change your current partners to fit your ideal of how a sport should be played. 

and makes no mention of disallowing the use of preferred lies if you are on the wrong fairway so you would be allowed to take advantage of the rule. But again, you need to refer to the exact wording specified by your committee. 

Officially, yes he is - you can see his page on FIFA's official site which lists the 1982 World Cup as an award. It's understandable though that he wouldn't consider himself a World Cup winner as he didn't play a match in the tournament. 

Given that, it doesn't seem too unlikely there are going to be quite a lot of these incidents out there. 

As such in your situation, two runs are scored: one for the player who was already on first, and one for the batter who hit the home run. However, only the batter is credited with a home run. It's possibly also worth noting here that for the purposes of winning the game, runs are the only thing that matters. It doesn't matter if they were home runs or not - they all count as runs; it's perfectly possible to win a game without scoring a single home run, but you obviously have to score at least one run. 

Imagine a test match where the pitch deteriorates significantly over the course of the match, so that by the 4th or 5th day it has very inconsistent bounce and pace and therefore batting is much harder than it was on the earlier days. At that point, if you've got two reasonably matched teams, the team batting last is almost certainly going to lose. Obviously, if you put a pub team against the South African test team, the South Africa test team is still going to win no matter when they bat, but it's generally considered a bad thing if the pitch has a significant input on the result. 

The general way is just the same for a European player as it is for an American player: get noticed by a college team, persuade them you're good enough. The problem for a European player is the "get noticed" part: while colleges have very efficient operations for finding the best high school players in the US, they do very little recruiting in Europe, just due to the costs involved for a tiny number of players. Hence you're going to have to do your own "marketing": 

(my emphasis). The point here is that it is unlikely that an arm which is in contact with the body was deliberately used to make contact with the ball - but not impossible. The referee must make a judgement is to whether the contact was deliberate or not, taking into account the points listed above, and then award a direct free kick (or penalty if appropriate) if they believe the contact was deliberate. 

This could not be a forfeit under the Laws of the Game as the Laws make no mention of forfeits. So long as the referee (and other officials) are clear as to which player was being substituted, there isn't a problem here - and if the referee wasn't clear as to which player was being substituted, they should not have allowed the substitute to enter the pitch until it was clear. 

That's the legalese, but the practicalities of the situation are that hockey goalkeepers are such specialised players that you can't just expect another player to put on some goalie pads and be able to play - that's the difference from basketball, where the positions are much more equivalent. 

This provision was brought in after a couple of incidents where captains were continuing to bowl with very old balls, and it was becoming increasingly hard to find a ball with "comparable wear". 

There are a number of anomalies around the Home Countries. Perhaps the closest to what you're thinking about involves Wrexham F.C., Colwyn Bay F.C. and Merthyr Town F.C., all of whom compete in the English football league and cup competitions, but are governed by the Football Association of Wales for administrative purposes. The more famous Welsh clubs in the top four tiers of the English league system are governed by the F.A., and are thus exclusively English clubs, despite actually playing in Wales. 

Yes. There is nothing in the rules, in particular Rule 19 "The Libero Player", which says that a libero cannot score points. 

i.e. any contact with the ball must be made while the ball is still on that team's side of the net: if the part of the ball which was touched was entirely on the receiving team's side of the net, then it is a legal touch. Conversely, if the part of the ball that was touched is on the opponent's side of the court, it is a fault. All that applies equally to front and back row players. (As you're aware, a front row player could attempt an attack hit on the ball. Of course, if a back row player attempted an attack hit on the ball while it was above the height of the net, that would also be a fault). 

This is a judgment call on the part of the umpires; I would personally be pretty harsh on this - running towards the stumps is wilful, even if the batsman intended to stop. Tripping and falling into the stumps would probably not be wilful. I don't believe the Laws cover the case of a batsman accidently disrupting the wicket while running, other than the possibility of the striker being out hit wicket if it occurs while setting off for the first run. It would pretty clearly be against the spirit of the game to attempt further runs in that scenario.
