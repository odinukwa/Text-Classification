This is fairly common. It could be for a number of reasons. They could be being pretty, out they may have had issues with things falling off the radar in the past so are making sure it doesn't get forgotten. Don't take it personally Clients can do any number of strange, inexpiable and downright crazy things. You as the contractor, should always be professional though it all. Sometimes clients will do things where you have to flag it to them and deal with it. Like asking for two completely contradictory requirements. If it makes the work impossible you need to tell them. This isn't a time like that. This is just a client creating duplicate issues. If it makes them happy let them and then tidy the issues up. It really isn't a big issue. 

Work out your market rate (I think Stack Overflow as a tool for this) Work out your monthly (or annual deficit), your market rate - your salary Book a meeting with your Father and the Co-owner to discuss this. You'll have to be firm but friendly. Frame it as 'by working for the family company I am effectively investing X monthly into the business, what can I get for this'. The owners need to look out for their long-term future but so do you. Shares or share options seem a viable option. 

It sounds like you are in a horrible situation, and you should never have to do such things. You sound like you are quite deliberately non-managerial. if you don't have a chance to move this may make it a bit easier for you. It is also worth you trying to find someone higher up the chain to talk to, even if you have never seen them in person. Your manager's behavior is not just hurting you and the team you are in but the company itself. If products don't get shipped profits drop and shareholders get unhappy. Thinking about it in a general rather than a personal nature may help you to make the step, you are not just helping yourself but the whole company. 

Precariously balance a very expensive looking (but in reality cheap) vase or some other ornament on the corner of your desk. It is important that it looks: 

I'd recommend look at this book Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware It explains that your brain has two modes of operation. One is a linear mode, which is fairly slow. This is what you are currently concentrating on and actively thinking about. There is also a huge amount of background, asynchronous, processing that goes on. While you are focusing hard, or trying to focus hard on something, you are slowing down this background processing. If you do something else, you free up the brain to ponder things in a non linear way. Having a break can help you to complete your tasks. Personally I would say a high percentage of big problems I solve are while I am not coding and doing something unrelated. Suddenly I would realize that the approach I was taking was not great and a small refactor would make it all so much better. So don't feel bad if you are not coding, your brain is still working on things. But be mindful that you still have to actually do the work. 

I have been hired by a phone company to implement Google Analytics for their Android device. With my skills in Google Infrastructure, I can help them create apps using Google products. My goal is to send all voice commands and actions in a Siri-like voice application in the company to Google Analytics. Within 1 week, I made it work and know the next steps. However, when I ask management about what they want me to track, the priorities were not set. I also somewhat detected through their intentions of using Google Analytics that the application has huge limitations not intended for their goal of counting all phones around the world with certain complicated reasons why it will not work. However, I did not know how to tell them why because I had a 10 month project in my hands, and I wanted to discover the general scope of the project so I could implement it correctly. I technically finished the project within 3 weeks of both learning Android, and learning to save through their unified project repository. Then my primary boss's mother died and applied for a 2 week leave. Without my boss's help in leading me to which priorities or path should the project lead, I needed to identify the project on my own by asking questions to whoever could give me answers. However, there was also tension between another lady programmer who created an Analytics program for the company (not connected to Google Analytics). She limits me in touching her code, and made me perform less by means of diverting me to some other unnecessary tasks like measuring packets (which I already told them that it was more or less 2KB to 3KB). It did not lead anywhere but oblivion for 2 weeks of measuring unnecessary data. I just proved that Google Analytics packet size was sending 1KB each action sent. My secondary boss seems to feel like I was asking too much questions, and thought that I did not know what I was doing. I could already sense that letting me measure packets was a trap. If I fight against them, my next actions would not lead anywhere, they would tell me that I'm not doing the priorities they assigned. So I decided to stick to whatever they told me to do (despite the contradiction within me that tells me to fight for the project I believe in), instead of fighting for what I think could have been right. My boss came back after a 2 week leave from her mother's burial, and my senses did not fail me. I got fired and told that I am not doing the priorities I meant to do. During the exit interview, I asked them if they could point out the priorities that I should have done for Google Analytics. Because they can not identify the priorities, I explained to them that I was trying to help them identify the priorities by means of explaining how Google Analytics work. Basically, I was in bad luck. Question: If it were you on my shoes, wherein you believe in the project, would you fight for it? How would you use influence in manipulating the situation to solve the issue? 

This answer assumes you are being unpaid during your internship, you imply this in your question but are not explicit about it. Company A is exploiting you. There is a culture that seems to have grown that people can be asked to work for nothing to gain skills and the possibility of future work. You are providing value to the company and not being compensated. I have no idea how or even if this is legal but it is exploitation all the same. So given this, I would suggest you forget about how well known company A is. They do not sound like a reputable employer. They are using their 'fame' as a means to exploit workers. Company B have shown they value you and your skill set and are not seeking to exploit you. They seem deserving of your time and efforts. 

There is another possibility: That while the team were happy hiring you their decision was overruled. Often hiring decisions stay within the local team before getting a final sign off from higher up. It does seem to fit the evidence. It was not just yourself that spent a lot of time, the company did as well. They would not do this if they were not seriously interested. It sounds like it was the final authorisation that caused the issue. I've seen it from the other side, where I have interviewed a good candidate for a role where there was supposed to be a job and to be told that it was not possible to hire them. It is unlikely that the company would let on if this was the case, to say 'we have no budget', or 'we have a hiring freeze' or 'the sales team blew the budget on their team building trip to Venice' is not something they would say to somebody in your position. While it is disappointing it does happen. 

People have answered about why the accepted wisdom is good, and they are valid points but you also asked 

Yea, the 'international and local wages and my relative position' sounds like a line they feed you to try and justify. I would believe it. It is possible that the company is struggling and can't afford to pay more. If their costs are being squeezed they may not have scope to pay more. A company would not want to tell their employees this directly so they may use the 'international average' as a way to fob you off. It is also possible they are being tight. They are trying to get away with paying you as little as possible. The can then go into profits or even bonuses for the line managers. If you are unable to leave and they will not negotiate the only other thing you can do is ask for a promotion. If you have several years of glowing reports this would seem possible. Perhaps it is time to take on more responsibility and get more wage for doing so. You don't specifically exclude this as an option so it is worth mentioning.
