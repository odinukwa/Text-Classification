as well as the early banking arrangements established by Europe's key trading cities (eg Amsterdam in 1609, Hamburg in 1619, and Nuremberg in 1621) modelled after the Venetian Initiative already proven by Venice, Genoa and Barcelona. Note that by the beginning of the 17th century all of Europe west of the Dvina-Dnieper line (at least) had a well established banking system offering Bill of Exchange (ie chequing) services and Foreign Exchange markets (also here) . Antwerp has a functioning Stock Exchange starting from 1531, and all those East India Companies were simply long-lived extensions of the limited liability concept that had long been used to finance risky maritime trade on a voyage-by-voyage basis. Somewhat coarsely, the financing which Antonio provides to Bassanio in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice illustrates the mechanism. 

I would argue that in fact Brandenburg-Prussia engaged very successfully in the colonization of Western Pomerania (1653); Magdeburg (1680); Eastern Pomerania (1720); Silesia (1740); Pomerelia & West Prussia(1772-1793); Schleswig-Holstein(1864); Hanover, Hesse, Nassau & Frankfurt(1866); and finally Bavaria, Lower & Upper Saxony, & Alsace-Lorraine (1870) to establish the German Empire. While this Empire was not an overseas empire like the Dutch, British and French, it was still very much an Empire; ruled by Prussians for Prussians. In the early 1900's the German Empire was the pre-eminent leader in physical science research, and was surpassed economically only by the United States and the British Empire. Brandenburg Prussia truly had arisen to a world power from very humble beginnings in 1600. It is worth noting that: 

Thus in answer to your question, by the time of Queen Victoria's ascension in 1837, both the Whig and Tory parties were defunct, replaced by the Conservative and Liberal parties. For the preceding several decades they had both been diverging from their defining ideologies as they diminished in importance on the political landscape. 

To my mind, every extradition case is an instance of "a foreign power attempting to compel another country to abide by International Law by means of that [second] country's judiciary". 

Never mind pre-Industrial Revolution. As late as 1910 and 1920 the most efficient way for most people in Toronto and Hamilton to get ice in the summer was for it to be harvested off of Hamilton Harbour (aka Burlington Bay) in the winter and stored in Niagara Escarpmnt cliffs. 

According to George Ridley Scott's book History of Torture Through the Ages - Chapter XVIII, branding was far more commonly used, almost exclusively used, as a form of punishment by torture rather than as a means of obtaining a confession or other witness testimony. The branding iron was used to mark convicted criminals in a fashion that, before extensive paper records and electronic communication, was effective in ensuring that repeat offenders were accurately identified: 

Full transcript of the judgements can be found for most defendants (including Rudolf Hess and Walther Funk). Update The Court seems to have found only Count IV without extenuating circumstance to be a Capital Offense; the others apparently regarded as Non-Capital Offenses Baldur von Schirach may have been lucky - Bulletins describing Jewish extermination were found amongst his office's papers, but no credible evidence was presented that he had actually been made aware of them, or otherwise read them.

Although the Convention of 1818 and the subsequent 1846 Oregon Treaty might be considered here, these both predate the establishment of a true Canadian Government. Hence I think the following Acts and acts of the post-1867 Government and people of Canada best answer the question: 

Certainly there were no wrist watches, or even chronometers, on any of the battle participants, so time spans must be taken with a grain of salt, but it certainly must be clear that both sides thought it completely normal for weary combatants to step out of the line occasionally to rest. And further that the lengths of time that soldiers of the period could sustain active combat was substantially greater than the 2 to 5 minutes proposed elsewhere. More notable than the timespan quoted is that the Gauls had time to "begin to demolish the rampart and to fill up the trench" while the battle progressed to its climax. That certainly was more than the work of just a few minutes. Also note that the practice is so ubiquitous that it is only mentioned in consequence of the inability of the Romans to spell each other, due to being so badly outnumbered. My answer here describes two additional occasions when Caesar describes the Gauls as practicing a continual relief of tired first-line troops. 

It is believed that the time period of which Strabo is writing is somewhere around 400 to 700 BCE, and not that of the authorship (circa 2 BCE). Further, only the richest of the temples in Corinth, that dedicated to Aphrodite, is claimed to have had so many as a thousand hetairas, or courtesans. It seems that the authors have been quite careless in their use of this reference. Although this particular quote may be thought somewhat ambiguous on the precise nature of a hetairas work, other references both by Strabo and others are quite explicit. The full range of modern LGBT seems to have been available in addition to more traditional heterosexual activity. 

In practice, throughout most of Western Europe, the nobility rapidly descended into just that subset of tenants who owed allegiance directly to the monarch - the tenants-in-chief. Likewise, only those tenants-in-chief were generally liable for treason - those below the nobility being both too valuable and too numerous to hold accountable for the acts of their liege-lords. Provided they subsequently swore fealty to whomever the monarch replaced their treasonous former lord with, all was in general forgiven. The primary exception to this was in the Holy Roman Empire, where the original stem duchies splintered into far more numerous imperial princes holding Landhoheit - sovereignty - within their own territory and entitled to inter-marry with reigning dynasties. 

French population growth (for the 40 years) from 1871 and 1911 was 8.6%, compared to 7.0% (for the 20 years) from 1919 to 1939. That is most definitely a baby boom. (Note that extrapolating from 20 years to 40 years, the post-war 7% translates to a 14.5% rate over 40 years.) German population growth over the same two periods was respectively 59% and 15%, so there is definitely a baby bust in Germany. However a baby bust in Germany was still a substantially greater growth rate than the contemporary baby boom in France, and Germany post-war was increasing in population at a much greater rate than Franc. This demographic knowledge was well known to both French and German politicians and planners of the inter-war years, and affected many decisions including the construction of the Maginot Line; and the respective decisions by French and German Generals to respectively imagine a defensive or offensive next war. Here is a source with more details on European population growth during the inter war years Another German source. 

A page from www.ancient-code.com shows up in a Google search for "Gobekli Tepe shepherd", but won't display for me (at least not right now). However it states in the search blurb: 

Certainly the story by Josephus is fanciful, and undoubtedly exaggerated in its details; but I still see no reason to doubt it's core, given Alexander's demonstrated vanity for this sort of attention. Just a whisper in his ear that the Jews had a holy book in a great temple foretelling a Greek defeating the Persians, and I think he would have postponed even a battle to visit in person. 

In order to prevent elements of this force from repeatedly sweeping though the channel destroying everything afloat in its way, the Germans would have had to not only achieve air superiority, but maintain it in the face of a determined RAF equipped with superior planes (Supermairine Spitfire, comparable in every way with the ME 109 but with almost twice the operating range) for the entire duration of the battle. The notion that the Germans could land a force in England capable of subduing the 338,000 veterans evacuated from Dunkirk reinforced by another 200,000 odd Commonwealth troops, and keep it supplied long enough to do so was even more ludicrous than Goring's claim of being able to supply Van Paulus by air. 

Further - I submit that any historical person chosen as a design image for a United States dollar coin is, objectively, famous. 

and confirmed here the truce of 1580 simply called an end to the fighting between the Spanish and Ottoman Empires that never resumed. There were never any official peace talks, and so no formal agreement on territorial concessions was ever negotiated. The Ottomans were first occupied with a war against Persia (Iran) and then with an attempt from 1593-1606 to capture Vienna from the Austrians . Philip II in turn became preoccupied with his attempt to subdue both the Dutch Republic and England that consumed hos attentions for the remainder of his reign. This effective abandonment of the Western and Central Mediterranean by the navies of both Spain and the Ottoman Empire, combined with the gradual decline of both Venice and Genoa, led to the rise of the Barbary states, and their associated piracy. This would continue into the 19th century when the combined efforts of British, French and United States military forces subdued them. 

Note that in 1887 Edison's Direct Current transmission was still the official, and dominant, means of distributing power in the U.S. (Link: $URL$ However, the flaw in Direct Current transmission, that would eventually lead to its discontinuance, was its extreme short range, requiring large generating stations every mile or two to supply the immediate vicinity. It is easy to imagine a large number of independent power utilities in New York City in that environment. Also, note that it is common accounting and business practice to separately incorporate every division of a start-up company, in order to better manage risk. That there were more than 30 electrical utility corporations operating in New York City does not by any means imply that they were independently owned. In fact Westinghouse owned the exclusive rights to the use of Tesla's Alternating Current distribution technology in North America, and Edison owned all the corresponding patents for Direct Current distribution. This was a very, very different world than today, much more akin to the PC market in the early 1980's before IBM and Microsoft entered the fray with the IBM-PC and MS-DOS. Consolidation really only occurred after the Niagara generating station was built in 1893, and began supplying cheap hydro-electrical power, alternating current of course, from Buffalo. This rapidly undercut all the independents. From the Wikipedia link History of Consolidated Edison: 

First, a spot of background science. The Longitude Problem is exactly identical to the problem of establishing simultaneity on widely separated locations on the Earth's surface, and both prerequisite the existence of a reliable estimate of the Earth's diameter. Certainly Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's diameter in the 3rd Century BC, and other civilizations may have done so by roughly the same time period. However the problem of establishing simultaneity is more difficult, and comes in two flavours. Longitude is calculated by comparing the elevation of an astronomical object to the pre-calculated (or observed) elevation of the same object at a reference location at the precisely simultaneous moment in time. Everything in the sky rotates once around that vast celestial sphere every 24 hours, so the more precisely one can establish simultaneity the more precise one's measurement of longitude will be. The problem is simpler when the goal is cartography - calculating the longitude, and thus precise location, of a given spot on the globe exactly once. In this case one can use the occurrence of a predicted astronomical event as the definition of simultaneity. Surveying teams are organized to travel to the specified locales well in advance of the event, and providing the skies are clear on the given day the necessary observations are made. Once the surveying teams return the results are tabulated and the maps drawn. The more difficult problem, and the one that confounded the British Admiralty into establishing the Longitude Prize, is of establishing the location of a moving vessel out of sight of land at whatever time the skies happened to be clear, wherever and whenever that was. One could not halt a sailing vessel in the middle of the ocean and wait for a pre-calculated event that occurred once or twice a month at best. It was necessary to resort to Dead Reckoning, a well-established and remarkably accurate science by the 17th and 18th centuries, which provided locations within one or two dozen miles on voyages thousands of miles long. When the goal was simply to voyage out and return home, this was more than adequate. However when the need is to avoid reefs of only a few hundred yards extent, being off by a few miles all too often results in foundering instead of sailing safely by. The accuracy of dead reckoning can be judged by the quality of 16th and 17th century maps, reproductions of which are readily available all over the web. Don't be misled by the contours of western North America - those are due to the wanderings of the North Geomagnetic Pole.
