No it wouldn't make it harder to crack Because the cipher key remains with the same complexity. For someone who wants to crack your code, he will proceed with the exact same process and crack it in approximatively the same time. Which means the book cipher is invisible for him - its as if it doesn't exist. Changing it every two weeks does make it harder to crack though. 

It's everything that came to my mind as of now. If I remember anything else, I'll edit the question to add it. Feel free to guide me to resources I can use if you know some, an incomplete answer is better than no answer at all. Thank you in advance ! Sasugasm 

How about Thallium? It absorbs through the skin so put it in their toothpaste, mouthwash, shaving cream, lotion, spray on their clothing, bed linens whatever is handy. It is rather slow acting so your murderer could be out of facility at the time of death. $URL$ 

There is very little petroleum product in a rocket. For example the shuttle used liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen for fuel. For energy in space they tend to use solar or nuclear power. The only petroleum used on the shuttle would be plastic. It could easily be made out of vegetable oil instead of mined oil. Getting to the space age would be more difficult. Much of the early industrial revolution was powered by oil. While as others have pointed out "alternative" energy is even older than the use of oil, oil beat all of them for ease of use and cost. Without mined oil the industrial revolution would have been slower in coming and not nearly so easily accomplished. For an alternative setting probably the least alternative history would be liquefied coal as a replacement for oil as an energy source. The most outlandish would require inventing magic batteries so that electricity from alternative sources became viable for more things than it is now. 

It depends on society's view of the creatures, their control over their wereishness, and how much the higher-ups know about each other. Assuming the most likely situation, that society fears and hates them, that they totally lose it once a month, and they they more-or-less all know they are all werewolves, it become simply a game of self-preservation and MAD. Threats: Losing control over yourself once a month, even if it's by turning in a fearsome beast, is a very vulnerable situation for somebody with lots of enemies, both within your organization and without. Seriously, it just takes ten guys armed with silver weapons. Gangs, while always hated by everybody, normally operate more-or-less under-the-radar, and rarely are outright despised by the whole of society. If word gets out that the capital city is run by monsters hated by everybody, no matter how strong they are, they are eventually going to fall to the force of an enraged public. Therefore, you'd have to keep this knowledge as concealed as possible from everybody, probably by threat of personal harm. It's easier if they have something to gain from you on a regular basis, so gang leaders would have to keep both whichever of their members and their 'property' who discover their secret convinced that it's in their best interest not to spill the beans and bring it all down. Of course, if they get too greedy, well, dead men don't talk. MAD: The reason mutual assured destruction would set in is because the leaders of each gang know all the above. While they may try to kill and destroy each other, a stability would develop simply because they have an unstoppable weapon: knowledge that the other gang is full of wereanimals. Move too far or push too hard, and eventually somebody will drop the bomb, even if it destroys them as well. Given the assumptions made at the top, there's no reason they'd ever want the word out, no matter how much the personal threat could help them. The information is just too dangerous. 

Sparta-like government The population is about the same that your City-States. Two kings rules the city, with a 28-member 'council of elders' limiting their powers. These men are recruited from the highest social class, the aristocratic Spartiates. Beneath is a middle class, called the Perioeci. Made up of farmers and artisans, the Perioeci pays taxes and can serve in the army, but they have no real political rights. At the bottom are the helots: a slave class. Classical Athens democracy For a City-State, I would think of no better choice. But I believe your City-States are a bit... too small for this kind of government. I will leave this here in case you want to adjust the numbers and give you a second option. 

From a computing power standpoint, it would take a computer larger than the world to fully simulate the world. They don't have a computer that big, so there will be holes in their simulation. It is just a matter of finding where they skimped on the processing power. You just have to act as oddly as possible to push up against a boundary they didn't expect. Use a microscope to look at sand on the beach, dig a 50 foot hole in the ground, some where there is a limit. They control your senses do they control how you feel on the inside? Eat too much does it feel the same, run too far do you feel the lactic acid build up in your muscles correctly? If you workout do you get stronger? Also what is the time frame for deciding in\out of simulation. Do subtle changes occur that normally happen when time passes, hair and nail growth that kind of thing? 

I am aware of being a newbie in the field I am asking my question... please be kind and explain what I did wrong if I make a mistake. The idea from where the problem bloom I love worldbuilding. Whenever I have a spare moment, I try to invent unique features for my world and how I can make them believable. This time around, the idea came from an article that talked about moons of gas giants habitable by humans. Immediately, I told myself 'wow, that's awesome! I need my world to be one of those!', and got into the process of collecting information about how to make it believable. Quickly, I found a lot of useful information (in particular questions on Stack Exchange, and some blogs found thanks to Google). Then I saw an article that made me think of another crazy idea : 

A world much like earth has a society which, although rather aware of metals, does not possess the knowledge or resources to refine ore and produces alloys. They have access to practically unlimited wood and a variety of stone and volcanic glasses, but the only metals they can utilize are whatever native examples are found in the ground. Would they be able to develop semi-robust computing? It would be bulky, but surely not impossible to develop non-electrical analytic devices: it has already been developed. Could it be done without metals, though? More importantly, would it? Assuming the society lived in peace and relative comfort, able to pursue academic issues at ease, and had fully optimized wooden/stone construction and tools, I imagine would have a relatively developed society. Would they conceive of and peruse the construction of a metal-free computer? 

Anti-nuclear technology Or how to defuse a nuclear weapons safely after it has been launched, with a relatively guaranteed success rate. At some point in history, this MUST have been researched by the countries of the world. If you imagine that the scientists actually found a way to prevent nuclear weapons attack, then MAD is not assured. After all, why would anyone fear launching a nuke when they can annihiliate the danger of any incoming retaliation ? If this sort of technology existed, the world would keep their nukes like a tool of pressure, but it would have a totally different meaning. Maybe they would try mission to sabotage the anti-nuclear technology of their enemies ? 

If we ever get to the point of having "space marshals", they will probably carry frangible bullets(safety bullets made of polymer packed with bird shot so they fragment on impact rather than pierce) just like air marshals used to. While the little pellets would cause their own problems in zero G, it shouldn't be too hard to believably work around or hand wave away low penetration round with no details on how it works. Perhaps bean bags like some less lethal weapons fire. 

Dolphin echolocation works at a max range of about 200m. That is at a slightly higher frequency though(40 to 130 kHz). Also that is 200m round trip so 400m one way, and accurate enough to target something the size of a couple of inches. For general singing or shouting I think something in the neighborhood of 1km sounds reasonable. 

Conquest and discovery has been an important part of developing the global political structure of today's Earth. After we expand and settle other planets, whether within the same solar system or not, eventually the colonies will grow and develop to the extent where they feel able to self-govern. Given that extraterrestrial colonies and their resources would be incredibly valuable to their parent government, they would be naturally hesitant to let them go, whether because of fear of a lack of control or fear that the new government will be forcibly assumed by a competing terrestrial government. Easily, historical examples can be found by looking at overseas colonies - except for two incongruities: firstly, the process of setting up not only a self-sufficient extraterrestrial colony, but a self-expanding extraterrestrial colony would require much more assistance than, say, setting up a self-expanding overseas colony. Additionally, the area available for a colony to expand into is much greater than historically: there's a whole planet out there! Would the self-governing colonies, after they finally stabilize, cover much greater area than their parent nations? Would it be continental, global, or even include the local moon(s)? Would they be powerful enough to peacefully hold this territory, or would competing, established governments/colonies be conterminously fighting for greater resources? How would the situation differ were the planet found inhabitable as opposed to requiring a (possibly international) terraforming project? In short, what type of interplanetary political structure would be most likely to develop, and what historical parallels are there to support your claims?
