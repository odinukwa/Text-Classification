Very careful - dangerous ground - for one of your contacts acknowledging such a goal, you need to be friends, and they need to like risks. Could be much easier to found your own company together and after a decent time change to another company, under your own responsibility. Taking over teams from other companies without their consent may not sit well with the original employer - when a single employee leaves it's very difficult to argue that he "can take away a customer with him". If a team leaves and take customer contacts, projects etc. with them, the original employer will make very sure that they do not take any IP with them developed when they were still employed. Be prepared to walk out naked - no codebase, fewer customers, and possibly an HR-related lawsuit on your back. 

Situation in Germany (IANAL): There are laws in place which make a strict distinction between working as a contractor or as a leased worker. The latter implicates significantly stronger obligations and other legal limitations. The implications for a company if a court finds that a contractor works as a leased worker may be severe. Companies take great care that contractors appear very different from their internal employees, i.e. making sure that contractors do no appear to be bound in the company hierarchy. 

So the scrum master clearly overstepped his bounds. It was his function to keep the retrospective focused to identifying specific problems which need to be addressed. How to proceed: 

I see this question from a different angle than most here: My optinion is: You have a culture problem, and you should accept some advice. You can have a creative sub-culture without offensive jokes and nerf-guns. In the question, and also in some answers i read that it is the right of people to behave as they want, just because they can. After some time this becomes some kind of mechanism which actually isolates the group. Even if everybody (including new members, who possibly are offended) in the group approves, how does this affect cooperation with other groups? I suggest the following approach to it: 

All of these things are critical skills if you're going to survive in the workplace and not get deluged by a ton of requests for work outside your immediate tasks. As soon as that starts happening you'll never get anything done and you'll be fighting fires forever. Regarding the answer above that suggests "What you need to do now is deliver", NO NO NO NO, and NO! Doing that circumvents your chain of command. Do not work for even one minute on a project outside of your group unless your manager has asked you to do it. Doing so undermines your manager and your team. Trust me, you do NOT make yourself look good by doing this, instead you make yourself and your team look like chumps that can be taken advantage of! Moving forward, what you need to do is act like your team and your current projects are so valuable to the company you can't possibly be interrupted. If someone outside your team even tomorrow asks you how your work on Project Z is going just deflect entirely: 

You handled this poorly. Clearly you haven't faced this situation so don't worry about it too much, but do learn from this and don't make the same mistake again. Here is what you should have done: Reply with complete confidence that Project Z is not currently in your wheelhouse. 

I don't agree with either of the answers currently posted. You could have handled this better (and still can) but first: 

Given this, you must assume that if your immediate management hasn't specifically tasked you with something for Project Z, then they currently have higher priorities--priorities delegated by their management. It is not your job to go around them by having someone outside of your chain of command tell you what to do. More to the point, it IS your job NOT to go outside of your chain of command! If the CEO asks you to stop what you're doing and shift gears, you do it. It it's some random person/manager, you don't. Period! 

Everything depends if the employee actually was stupid enough to tell that e was fired. normally there is no reason to disclose the fact that somebody was fired at all. If it comes to light in the team that he was fired then the only explanation should be that keeping him in the team would not have been good for the team, together with the instruction not to speculate about the details. 

The most important question is: are you in a business (e.g. food industry) where an employee not washing his hands/keeping the hygiene actually is a big problem for the certification of you plant (although i am not sure bathrooms are inspected) or the safety of the customers/consumers? 

This answer obviously is different if you have a well defined agile procedure, or if the PM is just randomly guessing numbers, but a priori the way in which he handled it doesn't need to be bad. 

My answer is significantly shorter than most answers here: It is the function of the HR department to perform this process in a way that there will be no repercussions against the company (and as such, you). If you have the feeling that you already said something which may be interpreted as a discriminatory action, tell this to HR (in the "i have the feeling, that he interpreted this differently from what i meant" way), and ask HR if you should switch this person to another manager.If HR decides to let him with you, it is their responsibility - ask them for advice and let HR guide the process and follow theirs course of action When i am confronted with such a situation, I only discuss the very specific problems which I had in a specific situation with that person, and ask him/her for the a small improvement (for example informing co-workers/me when there is a problem/delay). If he/she does this reliably at some point, the next thing can be fixed - or not, if he/she does not. 

I don't think the crime fits the punishment here. The 'crime' is lying to try and get a job - nobody should do it, but in the current climate of high unemployment you can see why someone desperate might try to. The punishment (a blacklist) has the potential to permanently affect that person's hope of future employment. Should a person who once lied: 

I'm pretty sure this isn't discrimination, though I don't think it's good management from your boss. When I find out that someone on my team is looking for another role I always try to find out why they want to leave, and whether there is anything I can do about it. For instance if lack of opportunities for progression was what they're looking for that may well lead to me giving them more chances, not fewer. I'd want to give them a good reason to stay. Good managers always do their utmost to keep good staff. Or to put it another way: fixing what's driving staff away is nearly always cheaper and easier than replacing them. However, if nothing I could do would make them stay then it's a different story: they'd still be treated with respect and as a valuable member of the team, but they would be bottom of the queue for training or progression opportunities. It's only fair to those who are staying and why waste limited resources on battles I cannot win? 

If a doctor's told you to wear boots for health reasons and your boss tells you not to explain to him that will cause the company to be fully liable for any injury you suffer while not wearing proper ankle supports. In many countries this would actually be grounds for immediate dismissal of your boss for gross-misconduct! Most companies take this extremely seriously: suppose you comply with your boss's petty demand and then you break an ankle or injure yourself in a way that makes mobility difficult. The company (the whole thing) is now liable for your compensation (potential lost earnings, pain and suffering, etc) and the fines can get very big. From the company's point of view your (frankly incompetent) boss has opened up the company to be liable for a potentially massive fine. Most companies take an extremely dim view of that. 

General rationale: If a manager makes a decision, and an team member acts like that guy does, he needs to leave the team ASAP (knowledge transfer), by all means. Talk to your manager, offer him to assist (e.g. by keeping back the announcement of your promotion) until they found a replacement for the guy. Pass all information which you think is essential in evaluating the situation to you manager. Suggest to offer the contractor a 3 month contract, search for a replacement behind his back, identify people in his team who are essential to replacing him swiftly and have crossed his path in a bad way in the past, and talk to them in a tentative way like "we may need Mr. X at another position soon, which of his knowledge/skills can you replace". Make a list of names which you think are loyal to him, and look for internal replacements (so that you can swap them to other teams if there are problems). Make use of external consultants in the transition phase. 

Personal/private mobile numbers which are read on the weekend or will disturb anybodies dinner or family life are only for emergencies, which require immediate attention. Using these for anything which can wait is nonprofessional. Using these for indicating how important your concern about your coworker is, is plainly inappropriate. For your own sake, seek an advisors help. 

To put it short: The best way to discipline him is to give him tasks appropriate to his attitude and skills, reduce his value t ohis boss and leave the further disciplining steps to his boss.
