If you have platform pedals, bind your foot to the other pedal using tape or narrow cable-ties. This binding should be weak enough to release your foot if you forget and lean that way, but strong enough that you can turn the crank through 360 degrees using one pedal. If your local terrain has significant undulations, bear in mind that your power output will be reduced and the leg whose foot is secured will be working more continuously and may fatigue quickly. Consider a more distant tool-source if it offers a flatter route or fewer interruptions. Good luck! 

Gearing is a very subjective question. Using Sheldon Brown's Gain Ratio Calculations, 36:17 on 110mm cranks will give a 1.25% lower gain ratio than 38:35 on 130mm cranks. 

The teeth of the sprockets, chainrings and jockeywheels are worn more quickly when the distance between chain pins is over spec, so for a cassette's "3-chain" life, it's better to change the first chain early, whereas the third chain can be run slightly longer since the rest of the drivetrain is approaching end-of-life. 

The myosin heads of muscle fibres move using the energy produced by converting ATP to ADP. The energy extracted is about 30.5 kJ/mol of ATP. Muscle tissue has limited ATP storage. Your muscles' primary fuel storage is local Glycogen. Converting Glucose to ATP Glycogen is converted to Glucose. Glycolysis, the Citric Acid Cycle (aka TCA Cycle, Krebs Cycle) and Oxidative Phosphorylation each produce ATP based on the byproducts of the previous process. These three processes produce 39 moles of ATP for each mole of Glycogen. For more detail, see $URL$ From $URL$ 

There are no circlips securing the bearings on the axle tube. The QR endcaps should be held in the axle by their o-rings. If these have been allowed to move apart (e.g by an inadequate or loose skewer), the overall width of the knurled surfaces that contact the frame will be more than 135mm. Assuming no damage to the endcaps or axle, pushing these back in should be enough. 

That size looks like an EC34 (external cups, 34mm inner head tube diameter for forks with 1.125 inch steerer tubes). You'll either have loose balls, balls with a retaining cage (metal or plastic), or cartridge bearings. If you have caged bearings, loose bearings will work fine but be more fiddly to install. Take one to your LBS or hardware store. If you have cartridge bearings, the size will be moulded into one of the rubber seals or be laser-etched on the side of the casing. Your LBS may stock one or two common sizes if you're lucky. Otherwise either buy a complete headset which uses the same size, or buy a complete headset and get it fitted or press it in yourself. Complete headsets can be cheaper than replacement bearings but the cost of paying a mechanic to install it will exceed the part cost. TH Industries make the bearings used in many headsets. Their brand FSA offers a variety of affordable good quality headsets. 

Note on the rear of the Goatlink, there is a lump which should sit on the original rotation stop. Shimano includes these diagrams in their rear derailleur documentation: Shimano gear hanger guidance $URL$ 

Even if the bead remains seated and no pinch-flats are suffered, an underinflated tyre will over-stress its sidewalls whenever there is a torque difference between the bead and the contact patch. This problem would be visible as rippling in the sidewall. This stress results in the carcass grain becoming visible through the sidewall rubber over time. Many fatbike tyres, designed to be used below 10psi, will develop visible carcass grain over the life of the tyre. I would not expect a standard MTB tyre to experience sidewall rippling at all if maintained above a minimum pressure appropriate for the load (i.e. a higher minimum pressure for heavier, faster or rougher riders). 

Tilting and vibration of the bike during use can encourage bubbles to travel upwards. Assuming you have an "open" hydraulic brake system, pressing the lever opens and closes a valve between the pressurised volume in the hose and the free fluid in the lever reservoir. Bubbles at the top are displaced into the reservoir through the valve until it closes, fixing the volume and allowing lever pressure to be transmitted to the caliper. When the lever is released, the valve has another open phase during which (hopefully) fluid is drawn into the volume. This behaviour is easy to observe in designs like Shimano's XTR BL-M975. 

The form of the bead interface should be consistent, no dents in any direction (unless the rim is for tubular "stick-on" tyres, in which case it would not have a bead seat). If the rim has a braking surface, it may have featured wear indicators. These would be either square-edged grooves or cylindrical indents. If the braking surface has become concave, the rim wall connecting the bead interface to the well of the rim (where the spokes end) might be dangerously thin. A failure here would be characterised by a sudden separation of a metallic ribbon as the bead interface succumbs to the force applied by the tyre pressure, and the tube would expand through this new opening until the tension in the rubber exceeds its strength or the sharp edges of the broken metal pierce the tube. The metal surrounding each eyelet should not be deformed. A wheel that has been repeatedly trued may have excessive tension on some of its spokes. A wheel with insufficient tension would not distribute loads appropriately as it rolls, causing spoke tension to fall an rise. Changes in tension cause deformation in the rim and spoke. Metals have a finite capacity for load cycles, ending with a fatigue failure. The rim may tear at an eyelet, allowing the nipple to pull through and causing a sudden change in the tension distribution of the wheel, which may deflect enough to cause contact with the brake or frame. A complete localised loss of tension may also result in a load exceeding the capacity of an unsupported rim section, resulting in a catastrophic failure of the wheel and sudden changes to the trajectory of the rider. 

A large carcass under low pressure is flexible. Due to the unusually large contact patch, the pressure your weight applies to the ground is low Low contact pressure + flexible carcass => reduced risk of penetration. I don't know of any fatbikers running liners, but many do do tubeless to reduce rotating weight and lose the rolling resistance created by friction between the tube and tyre.

Funny that. 1/8" chain isn't stronger unless you spend a lot of money on a high-spec track chain, which would have a more complex construction inside the rollers. Get a 3/32" chain. 

This calculation assumes you begin at 20km/h and travel at constant speed on a flat surface with no wind. Replenishing sugar from body fat Lipolysis releases fatty acid chains into the blood stream. In cell mitochondria, a ligase enzyme breaks these down to acyl-CoA. Beta oxidization breaks acyl-CoA and produces acetyl-CoA, which feeds the Citric Acid Cycle. The oxaloacetate from the Citric Acid Cycle is reduced to Malate, transported out to the Cytosol, where it's oxidised back to oxaloacetate then decarboxylated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). In the Liver, PEP is converted to pyruvate which can be converted (Glugoneogenesis) to Glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. The decarboxylation in the Cytosol is the rate limiting step in fat metabolism. Conclusion: Assuming you had a normal evening meal and you have breakfast when you arrive, this commute will probably not lower your blood glucose levels to dangerous levels. 

Given the bottom bracket type, the thin pressed dropouts and the type of seatbinding bolt used, this was not originally a particularly special bike. It looks like a well-done refurbishment. Look after it, enjoy it, but if it gets bent or stolen, don't worry too much about saving it or restoring it again. 

Nike+ is designed for running, the data captured while cycling may not be accurate or useful. I would recommend Strava as a fitness-tracking service which supports multiple sports. It is possible to export your old activities from Nike+ to GPX files which can be imported into Strava (or other apps like Endomondo, Runkeeper...). 

I suspect "H/E" means "Hook-edged". This would apply to almost every MTB rim. I have two bikes with slicks on MTB rims. I currently use Schwalbe Kojak 26 x 1.35" on one, and Schwalbe Marathon Racer 26 x 1.5" on the other.
