One could retort that the future fact and the future utterance are not themselves real. And if the future fact is not real it cannot be the same fact which now makes a present utterance of 'e is going to occur' true (or false). So I am unpersuaded by Faye's argument. But if purely for the sake of (further) argument one grants that an event, X, 3000 years in the future is real, and also that at some point 'it' is present, there is an identity problem. For X in the future and X (eventually) present to be identical, all descriptions of X-future and X-present must be the same. But there are descriptions of X-future, e.g. that it is 3000 years in the future, that do not apply to X-present. I offer all this very tentatively. By all means refute it if it is wrong at any or all points but I should like it to be treated as zetetic, investigative. I am happy to risk falling flat on my face. 

Absolutism as defined and developed by F.H. Bradley in Appearance and Reality recognises universal interdependence through his doctrine of internal relations. Here is a passage which, I'm afraid is less than totally clear, but in which you will catch clear echoes of your view : 

'Strength' for Nietzsche' is strength to choose our own values. This strength is lost, or never possessed, if we have been infected by 'slave morality' as he calls it. Slave morality prescribes what we must do; the strong for Nietzsche are by contrast the self-affirming, who reject all idea of what we must do, and create their own values. The creation of one's own values is the mark of self-afffirmation and hence of strength. ('Genealogy of Morals', I:2.) This is clearly a special sense of 'strength'. The strong are not those who subjugate others, who coerce the weak. And the weak are not those who lack the physical power or the psychological ability to stand up to the strong. Nietzsche is working with an unconventional understanding of strength and weakness. When he praises the strong he does not understand strength in the same way as, say, Thrasymachus in Plato's 'Republic'. Given this special sense of 'strength - and correspondingly of 'weakness' - it is hardly possible for the strong to oppress the weak and to abuse their own power. If I choose my own values, in which my strength consists, I can scarcely (simply by virtue of this choice) oppress the weak - whose weakness consists solely in the fact that they do not choose their own values. Some mention should be made of compassion, on which Nietzsche appears to be particularly hard : 'compassion I recognized as more dangerous than any vice' ('Will to Power' : 54). But in my view what Nietzsche mainly has against it is (a) that it distracts the strong, by its psychological pull, from choosing their own values (they are dragged down by this one); and (b) that it treats others as mere passive objects in need of help. By extending compassion of them, the strong are not helping them to become conscious of themselves as potentially self-affirming, value-creating agents ('Beyond Good and Evil' IX : 270). For all his brilliant style, Nietzsche is an extremely difficult writer to reconstruct with any assurance. I have offered a reading of the relevant part of his work. It is serious but tentative. No sympathy on my part should be assumed for any of the views I have attributed to him. 

Natural languages do not depend in any fundamental way on our learning the meanings of words from dictionaries. No child I know learns to speak, read and understand meanings by memorising dictionary entries. For one thing, a child must know some rules of grammar even to see the point of a dictionary. For another, children learn words by associating sounds with meanings; and meanings with written words only secondarily. Indeed I know some people who can speak a foreign language, understanding fully the meanings of its standard words, without being able to write or read a word of the language. They do not appear to be whizzing around in infinite loops. Sounds can be connected with meaning by ostension among other ways. X says to child Y : 'Cat jumps down' as the cat jumps down. X later says to the child Y : 'Kim jumps down' as child Z jumps down. The semantics of 'jumps' dawns on the child. This is only a thumbnail sketch of how a child comes to understand the meanings of words but there's not a dictionary in sight. Whatever the role of dictionaries, no feature of them renders natural languages meaningless. 

▻ FALLACY I take this broadly as a logical mistake. ▻ NO FALLACY - REASONABLE STATEMENT There are uses of 'You are an X, therefore you should know Y' which are perfectly reasonably. If I approached a Harvard professor of math., asked 'what is a prime number?', and they professed total ignorance, 'You are a mathematician, therefore you should know' would be completely in order in regard to so basic and elementary a matter. ▻ NO FALLACY BUT UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION By contrast if I asked a math teacher who teaches only basic math. what Betti numbers are, this is a relatively advanced matter and it would not be reasonable to say 'You are a mathematician, therefore you should know'. The nature of Betti numbers is not something that just any mathematician can be reasonably expected to know. ▻ WHEN TO USE 'YOU ARE AN X, THEREFORE YOU SHOULD KNOW Y' In sum 'You are an X, therefore you should know Y' is reasonable only if Y is something that falls within the standard knowledge of any and every X. ▻ THE OPEN-TEXTURE OF STANDARD KNOWLEDGE Now the question gets interesting since it is often contestable what does fall within standard knowledge. There is often no sharp line to be drawn at which to decide where 'standard knowledge' ends - the concept is open-textured. In your linguistic example I would expect any French graduate to know the French for a 'shop' or a 'street'. But the French for 'a 'wheelbarrow' ? It's on or near the edge of everyday speech. One could spend years in France without needing to use the word (brouette, I think). As not definitely calling on standard knowledge, 'you should know' is an unreasonable expectation in the wheelbarrow case. 

▻ Goodman and Hume are in considerable agreement (Goodman, FFF, 59ff.). Hume writes : When I see ... a Billiard-ball moving in a straight line towards another,... may I not conceive, that a hundred different events might... follow from [their contact or impulse]? ... Why then should we give the preference to one, which is no more consistent or conceivable than the rest? (Sect. 4, Part I.) If we reason a priori, anything may appear able to produce anything. The falling of a pebble may, for aught we know, extinguish the sun; or the wish of a man control the planets in their orbits. (Sect. XII, Part II.) Goodman agrees that no theory, no future projection, has any probability relative to any set of data: 'If our critic is asking ... why projections of predicates that have become entrenched happen to be those projections that will turn out to be true, the answer is that we do not by any means know that they will turn out to be true. When the time comes, the hypothesis that all emeralds are green may prove to be false, and the hypothesis that all are grue [green if observed before time t, blue otherwise] prove to be true' (FFF, 98-9). ▻ The major difference appears to be that Hume is addressing the question of the rational justification of induction. His conclusion is that induction cannot be justified deductively; and to justify it inductively (we can trust it because it has worked in the past) is circular. This also is Goodman's view but Goodman's problem is different. He is trying to characterise current inductive practice. ▻ Why do or should we prefer 'green' or 'blue' to 'grue' as descriptions under which we project - predict the future ? There is nothing logically at fault about 'green', 'blue', 'grue' or 'bleen'. They are, moreover, inter-definable. Goodman explains the case against 'artificial' ('pathological') predicates such as 'grue'. It comes down to entrenchment: 'The hypothesis 'All emeralds are grue' ... is unprojectible since it is overridden by 'All emeralds are green'. Since 'green' has been used more often in inductive arguments than 'grue', the latter hypothesis is better entrenched than the former. The hypothesis 'All emerubies are green' is unprojectible, since it is overridden by 'All rubies are red'. The latter contains the predicate 'ruby' which is better entrenched than 'emeruby' (a predicate defined as 'tested already for colour and being an emerald or not yet tested and being a ruby') while 'green' and 'red' are equally well entrenched.' Franz von Kutschera, 'Goodman on Induction', Erkenntnis (1975-), Vol. 12, No. 2, 195-6. ▻ 'Better entrenchment' seems to amount to no more than was stated above - that (e.g.) 'green' has been projected many more times than 'grue'. We are to prefer, and do prefer, predicates that are 'better entrenched'. Rules follow : 'A projected hypothesis with an ill-entrenched consequent is to be rejected if it conflicts with another hypothesis (1) that has the same antecedent and a much better entrenched consequent, and (2) that is either (a) both violated [disconfirmed] and supported [confirmed] or (b) neither' (FFF, 101-2). ▻ If there is more to Goodman than this, and there may well be, then I've missed it. But there's no place better than PSE to find out.
