This paper, for example, lists cases of solar retinopathy which suffered by people who were using glass (smoked glass, stained glass, sunglasses, etc.): Brit. J. Ophthal. (I969) 53, 534 Visual prognosis after solar retinopathy P. A. MAcFAUL 

Chimpanzees aren't the only apes who like bananas: for example here is a Toutube video showing an orangutan putting 10 bananas in his mouth at once. (I think that's to carry them somewhere to eat later: monkeys carry things in their mouths: they don't have shopping bags or clothes with pockets, and put their hands on the ground when they walk). 

Of course Jan Goodall isn't the only one to document this. My month with the chimps By Susan Fussell January 15, 2009: 

What does 'choked and couldn't breathe' mean? Comments below this answer suggests misunderstandings about the word "choke" (in the question and in the actual event). 

The talk says that "10,000 hours" is, to within an order of magnitude, the amount of practice required to get expert-level performance: e.g. to be a professional athlete. It says that, conversely, with a bit of practice you can get really good, really quickly. The following is, I think, an example of the truth of that: 

Note that "seedcotton" is the yet-to-be-processed crop of the cotton harvest, not "cotton seed" (ref). So the statistics show a net benefit, on average. However (I speculate) the increased cost may increase the risk, for small farmers who can't afford occasional failures. It also provides fuel for the argument that the seeds themselves are expensive. 

The English version of the phrase admits the second meaning as well as the first; but the Greek is only saying the first. We do not know why it's a popular quote. Perhaps it suits someone's preconceptions or political agenda, e.g. "the rich are rich because they worked harder than everyone else". IMO that meaning (comparative magnitude) isn't implied in the original, which is more like Yoda's "Do. Or do not." (There is no try.) The original also has, IMO, something of a dualist meaning: "no success without effort". In context, it seems almost a truism, (who knows, perhaps it was already a proverbial phrase in Sophocles' time): 

Factcheck.org says they found no evidence that she had a view like that one. Cain’s False Attack on Planned Parenthood 

Using this to interpret paragraph 36 which I quoted above, I think I understand that (the rest of this paragraph is in my own words and I may be using some words such as 'heresy' inaccurately) whereas Darwin's theories used to be ridiculed and dismissed as incompatible with religious belief, Pius was carefully and deliberately saying that the theory of evolution is not necessarily a heresy (but neither should it be taken atheist). I think I therefore agree with the following summary from Wikipedia about Religious attitudes to On The Origin of Species: 

The reasoning implied is that Buddhist monks depend on charity (gifts of food) from lay people. If the lay people Islamify (to avoid jizya) then the monks have no means of support and must emigrate, go hungry, or disrobe. In a comment you wrote, "Mostly the Jizyah was around 5% per able bodied man" but I don't think you can make that assumption. The conclusion (pages 370 through 373) to Religion and society in Arab Sind gives further reasons: 

My guess is that this is the paper which would explain why Sweden's HDI was, uniquely, calculated as dropping; but I haven't found a copy of this document so I can't review it. But even without knowing how Sweden's drop in HDI was calculated, there enough information (explained in this answer) to see how little this alleged drop matters. 

The report was published in August 2014 (about two weeks ago as of today). It was subsequent to (i.e. preceded by) articles published in The Times, for example, 

The GAO made four "Recommendations for Executive Action", only one of which (which was to review the paperwork) now has a status of "Closed - implemented". Reporting violations to the USDA The USDA is more concerned with "food safety" than "humane killing". On the subject of "food safety", the problem at the Canadian XL Foods meat packing (slaughterhouse) was that the workers were too hurried: for example The Globe and Mail's XL Foods workers feared raising food safety concerns, union says article wrote, 

There's a more detailed article on the subject here, written by the author cited in the OP, which may be the origin of the claim made in the Italian magazine: The vegetarian dilemma The elements of the argument, which justify the claim, are: 

There are several allegations and studies which suggest that cinnamon does or may help regulate insulin levels in diabetics. However the American Diabetes Society disagrees, saying, 

An editorial opinion (16 August 2012) from The Guardian was that Assange is not entitled to protection under the 1951 UN refugee convention. Refugee protection does not apply to the WikiLeaks founder and it is wrong of him to claim it

Wikipedia says that the writings of Bartolomé de las Casas were part of the origin of the Black Legend; and its summary of the Scholarly analysis on that subject includes statements such as the following: 

Wikipedia talks at length about the UK's "independent" nuclear deterrent. This paper from 2006 ends with, 

However monkeys don't only eat bananas. The "A huge menu" section of the San Diego Zoo web site page about monkeys says, 

Tangentially relevant is that even when there are "international laws", they are subject to dispute and interpretation. Here's one well-documented example of that: USA Today: Swiss free Roman Polanski; won't extradite director to U.S. 

Regarding his activities before he was arrested, one of the blogs referenced in the OP (which I viewed as a questionable 'claim', not as 'evidence') said, 

Further to How to proceed when implicit and explicit claims diverge I'd like to point out an inaccuracy in the claim. I can't improve on the accepted answer which answers the question about language. However the claim says, 

I don't (currently) read German so I won't pursue this search, but a/the place to look would be in Praktischer Idealismus (1925). 

To answer your comment, We're not turning money over to the Assad regime, but I'm guessing to some kind of aid workers. There's some information about that in this September 23, 2013 article by the Associated Press -- U.S. faces tough challenges to deliver aid in Syria says, 

The "outside the United States or Europe" is a reference to earlier in the chapter where it talks about language barriers (the interrogator not being fluent in the subject's language) and cultural barriers (the interrogator not being fluent in the subject's culture, religion, etc.). The chapter includes many statements such as, 

It's easy to imagine most of the men of fighting age dying, in places like Leningrad. Russia accounts for maybe half the population of the USSR, the next largest being the Ukraine. Given that there was mass conscription I'm going to guess that Russian losses were representative of those of the USSR as a whole (though it also wouldn't surprise me if Ukrainian casualties were higher). Still I don't see how or from where to infer 80%. Perhaps (I speculate) the pre-war army was nearly annihilated, and that every man born in 1923 was (aged 18 in 1941 and) a conscript in that army: 

The closest I've come to finding (using Google) its being used by orthodox practitioners is that they are still investigating (haven't proven) whether a niacin skin test a.k.a. "flush test" may be useful in diagnosing schizophrenia. For example a study from 2010 says, 

This paragraph talks about authors simplifying spelling (e.g. using one consonant instead of two). However the question is about modern-day French. French spelling has changed a lot (e.g. it says above that a third of all words are changed in 1740), all under the direction of the French Academy. So I think it's fair to conclude that the spelling of modern French is entirely due to the French Academy and not to writers or printers being paid by the letter. The reason why there many silent vowels is to remind you of the latin word: assuming that you know latin, the latinised spelling makes it easier to recognize the meaning of written french.
