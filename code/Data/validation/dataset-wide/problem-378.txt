To adequately answer this question, we need to know the spectral class of all of the stars in this system, however, the effects on humans of each of the spectral classes individually can be described: Class O, B - blue stars. These stars have a very high UV output, as well as being very bright for their size. Humans exposed to their light would be quickly sunburned, and unlike our sun, just having such a sun in your field of view for more than a few seconds could cause temporary retinal afterimages. Longer exposure could cause blindness without sufficient protection. Class A, F - white & yellow/white stars. These stars are not quite as bright, but they still produce more UV than our sun, though less than O and B stars. Sunburn would still be an issue, though blindness would not be much of an issue. Class G - yellow stars. Just like our sun. We know what the effects of such a star are from personal experience. Class K - orange stars. Not much UV at all. Dark skinned people could suffer from Vitamin D deficiencies if not provided in their diet even if they go about practically naked. Light skinned people might get enough UV to produce Vitamin D if they don't wear much clothing. Sunburn is not an issue. Class M - red stars. No UV to speak of. Everyone has to gain Vitamin D from their diet, since they won't be able to produce it from UV exposure. The effects of having several of these stars in the same system would be cumulative - blue stars could cause blindness and sunburn, but any UV-producing star would compensate for the lack of UV from orange and red stars. EDIT: Size doesn't matter, it is only the colour that matters. Blue stars produce most of their radiation in the UV part of the spectrum, and red stars produce most of their light in the IR part of the spectrum. Given equal visible light luminosity, the red star would produce no UV, and thus sunbathing in its light would cause no sunburn regardless of the time spent in its light. This would be the warmest part of the day, given its high IR output. The yellow star would produce enough UV to prevent vitamin D deficiencies, as would the blue star. The blue star itself, while not producing more visible light in total, would concentrate its light into a smaller point in the sky, and would appear much brighter, easily causing retinal afterimages like looking at a welding arc. Also, it would cause sunburn quite quickly, in a matter of minutes. This would be the coolest part of the day due to the lower levels of IR. Vitamin D deficiency would definitely not be a problem unless people hid from the blue and the yellow suns altogether. Atmospheric ozone could mitigate UV exposure to some degree, but it is unlikely that such an effect would be much greater than that of our own ozone layer, and could well be less. 

because merfolk are cheaper than robots and machines can travel faster than humans. imagine you want to colonize a planet that is 10 light-years away. first you send your generation ship, but it will take 1000 years to get there because the human body can't accelerate very fast without dying. meanwhile, you send a colonization kit at nearly light speed. it arrives in 20 years and starts building a space port for you. unfortunately, you can't afford to send an entire space port, so you just send some robots that use the native resources to build a space port and stock it with food and other supplies. you also can't afford to send enough robots to do all the mining, smelting, constructing, farming, etc. so the first thing your robots do is build more robots. it turns out that on planets suitable for life, the most accessible resources to a tiny space probe are organic molecules. so the "robots" your probe builds are effectively tiny plants which generate the energy you need to fuel more complex machines. it then builds animals that are smart enough to build your space port. those animals are humanoid so they are easier to relate to, but they are aquatic so that when your descendants arrive they can colonize the land while the merfolk continue to live happily in the sea. indeed, you can even genetically program the merfolk to desire to build space ports but hate the idea of actually leaving the sea personally. it's like "brave new world" meets "a for andromeda" 

The primary difference between a manufactured and an evolved EM transceiver system would be organisation. The manufactured system would be arranged logically because that is the way that its designers think about it. However, an evolved system would likely have components all jumbled together with surprising effects. Evolved systems have proven to be more efficient and effective than most of the things we manufacture to do the same jobs today, though there are exceptions. Should any of the features mentioned in the question be important, I have no doubt that they could evolve. One feature that I believe would be different between a manufactured and an evolved EM system would be multiplexing - an evolved EM system would be more likely to use broad swathes of the EM spectrum rather than our narrow-band manufactured systems. This would confer its own set of advantages. 

I think that you will find - as I have - that a single software package that does everything we want does not exist as yet. My enquiries have found pytectonics (that admittedly I haven't tried yet as it was only mentioned today) on Software Recommendations Stack Overflow for generating a world using global plate tectonics. Given the shape of the landscape, other software could generate river systems and erosion. As for generating maps, I currently use Corel Draw, a vector graphics suite capable of separating a graphic into layers that can be selectively shown or hidden, ideal for mapmaking as it can also be zoomed almost indefinitely without becoming pixelated. It is capable of printing sections of drawings, and it can convert vector images to pixel-based formats easily. I have tried Campaign Cartographer, but when I tried it some time back, I found it a bit primitive and limited compared with Corel Draw. It may have changed since then. All of this involves far more effort than I would prefer, unfortunately. 

some rivers end in a salt lake, salt flats or salt marsh. the water flows into the salty area, then evaporates away leaving behind the salt and other sediment. this area might not be called a "sea" if it isn't a large enough body of standing water. some rivers will flow "backwards" at high tide. nearly all rivers do this to some extent. they generally don't flow backwards long or hard enough to actually reach an area called a "lake". after earthquakes, it may take a short time for the sea to flow into a newly created depression. this situation generally resolves within a few days.

once "the swarm" consumed a large red 3-armed smelly hairy thing, it would proceed to consume all large red 3-armed smelly hairy things before going dormant again. to take dogs as a model, perhaps "the overlords" like variety in their pets, and occasionally cull out any sub-species that becomes too common. looking specifically at "monsters inc", perhaps human children would eventually become accustomed to the appearance of a given monster and stop screaming. if your spawn required human child screams to survive, then being a novel (and therefore scary) shape would give them a competitive advantage. 

DonyorM has made some good points, but I feel that I should add that the limiting factors in the height of trees (the tallest plants known to us) are many: 

So, Question: What are the machines doing with the humans? Answer: Giving the humans something to fight against! 

You'd be better off having your dragon have a conventional dragonish meat diet, and have it produce flammable oils that it can ignite - such oils have a higher energy content, burn hotter, and may be produced by biochemical processes within the dragon's own tissues. A better solution still would be for the dragon to obtain its fuel from an external source, but flammable or better yet, pyrophoric compounds, or even their precursors, are difficult to obtain in the natural environment. 

In order to fulfil the goal of maximising the numbers of enrolled insured, the AI must, in the most cost-effective manner (as per goal 2), get the greatest numbers of people enrolled as possible. It is conceivably possible that the AI will see that the most cost effective means to do this is to: 

It is not beyond the bounds of possibility for this 'organism' to actually be two or more organisms, a 'body' and two (perhaps different) 'wings', that combine to form a single rotary-winged unit. However, the organisms' ancestors must have been viable in a less-evolved state. Perhaps this symbiotic grouping evolved when a 'body' ancestor took to hanging on to one or two 'rotor' ancestors in such a way that when the group fell, the rotors would rotate, providing increased drag and retarding a fall, allowing safe falls from a greater, potentially unlimited, height. By evolving the means to power the rotation of the rotor symbiotes, the loss of altitude could be further slowed and eventually negated and then reversed. Communication between the symbiotes could evolve, giving the ability to change wing aspect on command from the body, as could symbiotic nutrition, the body feeding its symbiotic wings when convenient. While the organisms involved must at some point in time be capable of independent existence, there is no reason why they may not evolve in tandem to be totally dependent on one-another, any wing lacking a body or any body lacking its wing(s) being far less or even unable to survive without the other(s). These organisms would breed and reproduce together, and would get together in infancy and then remain a group, the loss of any one of the group being fatal to the other(s). However, prior to the evolutionary point where symbiosis becomes obligate, it may be possible for a body to acquire a new wing, and vice-versa. It is possible that the wings and bodies may be two completely different species, or that they may be the same species, but different genders, the female bodies being in symbiosis with the male wings. 

pixelation basically, any simulation has a max resolution. at some point, you stop drawing discrete pixels, and just calculate the average effect of everything below that resolution as a continuous field of forces and probabilities. for example, if you wanted to simulate the solar system without calculating the position and velocity of every electron, then you would simply use an equation to compute the average position and velocity the planets and other large bodies. the pixelation limit of that simulation would be at the planet level and you couldn't break apart a planet to look at how it's internal components interact. if you want to "zoom in" on part of the earth and see animals running around, you need to increase your computing power substantially. the pixel limit of our universe appears to be sub-atomic particles (e.g. electrons), indicating that we live in a simulation that pixelates at around the size of an electron. you simply can not assign a location and velocity to an electron in any meaningful way because it is smaller than a "pixel" in the simulator that runs our universe. 

i don't think it would make any difference at all. a 30-40% strength advantage is absolutely devastating in 1-on-1 combat. 100-300% is simply overkill. women had very little political power until the "rule of law" took hold. after which, their relative physical strength was virtually irrelevant. 

The creators of the technology that 'transfers' 'luck' (i.e. net benefit or harm to living beings) deliberately included an unnecessary component that negatively affects non-target beings at the same time as it positively affects target beings, according to the net gain or loss inferred on targets and non-targets, based on the subjective appraisal of said gain/loss by all beings within its area of effect. 

With both worlds having an oxygen atmosphere, life would have to exist on both. This would imply that the two worlds were fairly close together, enough so that meteor impact ejecta could carry microorganisms from one to the other. It is unlikely that there would be naturally-occurring sentient, tool-using species on both at the same time, so any population of tool-using sentients would effectively have the option of colonising the sister world. The presence of a neighbouring world would have encouraged the production of telescopes, and when life could be seen on the other world, it would have encouraged the chemical and physical sciences to the point where a trip from one world to the other could be contemplated and executed. We could well have had DaVinci's Rocket Mission to Counter-Earth in the late fifteenth to early sixteenth century. It would have been a one-way trip for the explorers, who might have been as numerous as ten or so, but with the prospect of long-term survival and colonisation, the missions would have continued, carrying both men and women, and establishing a permanent human presence on the Counter-Earth. Communication could be conducted initially by heliograph and a code similar to morse, as well as by laying out large letters in open spaces to be viewed by telescope, but with the invention of radio, this would have enabled two-way communication between the worlds. It would probably have become possible for return trips to Earth in the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries, and we would probably be using our computers and writing Stackexchange answers on our PCs right now in the nineteenth century. There would be regular trips between the worlds, though they would be very expensive and only used by VIPs and the wealthy. The likelihood is that the launch vehicles would involve eithersome sort of atomic rocket, or a ground-based power source, such as a laser launch system. A space elevator would probably already be in planning. There would be no wars between the worlds save wars of words - and in our modern times, electronic wars conducted over the internet - since the cost of conducting physical warfare across the gap between gravity wells would be prohibitively expensive, out of proportion to any possible gain. 

these are ancient traditions in nearly every culture for obvious reasons. in fact, many cultures consider children to be little more than property of their parents until they take a new name (e.g. during a rite of passage where a boy becomes a man, or when ownership of a woman is transferred during marriage). so, by naming the demon, you are assuming the role of it's parent, and therefore it must obey you (by divine law/natural order/etc.). also, it is worth noting that strangers are universally feared. and a stranger is loosely defined as someone who's name you do not know. e.g.: 

war between species would be nearly impossible. each species would completely dominate any battle fought in their domain. as such, wars simply wouldn't happen. there might be some skirmishes on the borders, but there is no way that one species could ever conquer another, so full-fledged war is out of the question. however, trade is quite likely. the merfolk would trade fish, the morlocks would trade metals and gems. the surface folk would trade crops and leather. as modern technology appeared, there might be the possibility of warfare since you could poison the entire sea, or cause continuous earthquakes. even then, it seems unlikely that you would gain much from committing genocide. side note: it is not clear how the morlocks would survive. nearly all life on earth depends on energy from the sun. assuming the morlocks use some sort of radioactive material for energy (therefore food), that could be another item of trade (or combat). 

The problem with preparing to perform an exploration of a large alien structure which is itself in a hostile environment is that it is by definition, alien. Without any clue as to the physiology or psychology of the alien builders of this structure, we cannot know its purpose from its external structure. The investigators would be foolish to make any assumptions other than that the structure is laden with lethal traps and is on the verge of structural collapse. Hence, any initial exploration would take place robotically. The robots' human drivers would sit safely in their habitats on Mars well distant - and preferably separated by a mountain range (in case the structure houses the equivalent of a nuclear device) - from the alien pyramid until it could be shown that humans would not be physically imperilled by their presence at the site. Most likely, there would be a number of robots, each specialising in a particular type of exploration, including digging, drilling, weight-lifting, narrow-space infiltration, and so on, every robot equipped with a broad range of sensors, and each type of robot available in several instances to provide a backup against mishaps. Only once the structure has been shown to be safe for robots over an extensive period of time would humans be permitted to venture anywhere near it, and even then extreme caution would be exercised, with the numbers of investigators limited to no more - or less - than two until their safety can be demonstrated. Regardless of the fact that the OP says that these pyramids were built with low tech, and like the Egyptian pyramids, were built to last, the investigators will not be able to either know or assume that. They must - for their own safety and that of their friends and relatives and all the other inhabitants of Earth - proceed initially as if the structure was designed and intended to cause the destruction of all of humanity, or at least to kill anyone who investigates it. No assumption can be made about the stability of the structure - it may have been made to withstand external stresses as present on Mars, but to collapse at the slightest disturbance inside it. Without such caution, the unknowns concealed within could - figuratively or even literally - jump up and bite the investigators on their backsides.
