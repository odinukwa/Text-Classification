This is a tricky situation. You got lucky: you and the employer both decided (independently) that it wasn't going to be a good match for you. But the reasons for that are completely different. Here's the key difference. Your reason was because the job wasn't a good fit for your particular career path. Their reason was implying that you are not a good employee. I personally disagree with their logic here. Specifically, having the fortitude to decline to answer an interviewer's question shows you have more confidence than the average interviewer, not a lack of confidence as they seem to indicate. So it's easy to logically say they are simply wrong in their assessment. What they should have said was "we didn't like that you didn't disclose your salary information, so we cut you loose" because that's what it seems like. So we can all agree, these guys are jerks and we should forget them. But... 

I live in the UK and am looking for a new job. I have been approached by a US based company who have no UK subsidiary or presence. They want to offer me a job, but in order to get paid I will likely have to either open a Ltd Company or work as self-employed, most likely the former as the company made it clear that they wish to employ me - in a regular employer-employee relationship, though the contract will be drafted in terms of me offering consultancy services to them (I am still waiting on the actual contract to come in). I am uncertain whether this makes sense, given that they will, in fact, be my employer. I don't see how this will work in both the legal and tax sense - it feels like a tax dodge by them (and I am worried it will fall back on me). They have a few hundred employees across the world, including here in the UK, apparently under similar contracts, so all "employees" are classed as self employed in the country they reside and are responsible for paying their own taxes and have no employment rights but have to abide by company protocol as though they are employed. This feels rather unusual to me - is there cause for concern? 

Many large companies have generic postings for different teams. For example there might be a web team, a mobile team, an internal apps team and a dev ops team. For entry level positions they're mostly going to be the same. Some coding, some scripting, CS degree helpful, etc. Also, many shops have hundreds of developers. So, even with low turnover rates they're always looking for new candidates. And some are always willing to pay to keep the door open to rockstars when they come through. It's unlikely that they've been holding out for 10 months trying to find the right person to fill their team. They're most likely casting a large, wide net. 

The most important thing you can do (in addition to enderland's entirely reasonable suggestions) is to keep your head up. Time and time again, a theme that pops up in how to teach people to do sales is to keep the conversation positive - and when you're interviewing/applying you're trying to sell yourself. If you don't stay positive, you don't stand a chance. So hold that head up high - something will come up. You're a candidate who is capable of getting the job. Obviously, because you already have one. So stay positive. 

In countries/jurisdictions where the law does not provide for clear limitations like this, employers might be tempted to slap a broad non-compete clause on everybody's contract – that might be the source of the story you read – but that does not mean they would necessarily bother with enforcing it in each and every case. And I currently work for a very large company, in a locale where the rules are pretty lax, yet my contract only has a very reasonable non-compete clause so don't let this stop you from applying wherever you want. If that's really a show-stopper for you, you can always ask about it after you got an offer and before handing in your notice for your current job. Finally, a friend of mine once switched from an employer to another one that was clearly covered by her non-compete agreement but her new employer was willing to cover any damages/penalty she might have to pay for breaking her contract and approached her former employer to negotiate directly with them. 

For the first, I'm not so sure that you do. You won't have junior developers to delegate minor tasks to. You won't have active testers in the business side, since they don't even know you're doing it. You don't have the latest specs and refinements and wish-lists, because again no one knows you're doing it. You don't have the tracking tools you need (although you could set up your own Bugzilla or something.) Now, each of these can be mitigated, especially if you can find a business user your management trusts to help you, but they do need to be mitigated somehow. For the second, it sounds like you will. After all, they desperately need this new version. Your management definitely seems like the "throw money at the problem type" and you're the target they're throwing money at. That being said, do keep documentation of all the work you do, because being under the radar and not using the approved ticketing system will mean you need to dot all your T's and cross all your I's when it comes time to proving you did the work you agreed to. For the third, this might be tricky. Maybe once you release they can admit that you exist and be like "Mik has been instrumental in cleaning up the bugs and releasing this shiny new... interface ... wink" and then you can get references. But they might just as easily shove you out the door and say "thanks for cleaning up after us, we're gonna get back to #^@%^ing things up again! Tata!" Now, as for ethics, I can't help you there. If they want to run their business shady, they can. I'm contracted to do a job under certain constraints, I do the job under those constraints as long as I'm set up for present and future success. The ethical side you'll have to reach on your own. 

In general, leaving a workplace beacuse you haven't gotten along with someone would raise a red flag to most HR people (the good ones would certainly inquire further about that, either with you or with that company). That's not a good thing - it can indicate you are not good at working with others etc. I don't suggest you lie about why you left, but usually that is due to a number of different things - finding the work boring, wanting a new challenge etc... Consider the whole range of reasons you have left the place for - and stick to one. As for the suicide - even if it were relevent to your leaving the job (and there is nothing in your question that indicates that), why bring that up? It only brings up awkward questions that you will not be able to answer. 

The demo they set up is specifically structured to highlight problem areas they want to avoid and to set up challenges they feel you'll be working with every day. So bite the bullet and do the exercise. If you're as great of a coder as you feel you are, it won't be a problem at all. 

So keeping those philosophies in mind, we have unlimited work from home days. If you have client meetings, obviously you need to be in the office for those. If your manager feels you're abusing the work from home policy (or sick policy, which is also unlimited,) they will talk with you about it. Because we hired quality people, we know if someone ever did have to have a talk, it would be resolved, or the manager would simply revoke the ability of that employee to work from home. But honestly, if someone isn't pulling their weight, it isn't just because they're working from home. There's bound to be many other factors leading up to such a discussion. On a side note, if you're moving into a new managerial role and start removing perks, you're likely to get a lot of resistance.
