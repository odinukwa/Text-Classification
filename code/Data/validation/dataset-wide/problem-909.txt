Surprisingly, the haiku has been attributed to Bashō throughout the mainstream media, including The Telegraph and (as you stated in the question) Time, although the phrasing looks so similar that I could imagine one of the articles being 'inspired' by the other. I'd be interested to know if anyone has a copy of the attribution referenced on MI6 HQ's site to see whether it is ambiguous; unfortunately, I don't have a copy, but I can say with a reasonable amount of confidence that Fleming wrote the haiku and did not intend to attribute it to Bashō. 

Brief Lives, chapter 7. For a moment in Destiny's garden Delirium regains her sanity, reminding Destiny of the days when she was Delight. 

Click for full resolution. At that point Lucifer has his hidden agenda, namely getting the Letter of Passage from Yahweh - he wouldn't go to all the trouble of fighting the Velleity otherwise. Getting the Letter serves other means - breaking free of Yahweh's Creation, and of his omniscience and omnipresence. This is what Lucifer wants, or desires (as explained later, from the start of creation) - he doesn't show interest in anything else, and everything he does in the Lucifer comics series is for that one goal. This was also acknowledged in the last issue of the series: 

is one of them, having in 2012 awarded their first-ever Song Lyrics of Literary Excellence to Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen. Even further proof is that Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016. 

If Martin had wanted us to draw some parallel between Bronn and Illyrio he would have had the perfect opportunity during Tyrion's conversations. Beyond that I have never run across any mentions of similarities between the two in any of of Martin's interviews. 

Why is the story female? And what does female mean here? Both the main characters in it are male (there's of course them being gay, but I don't think it prompts the story being called female), and I don't see any traits in the story which could be called female. 1 Hat tip to jo1storm for finding it on Neil Gaiman's website. 

The list may be amended, but this is the general shape of things. The novel is set in the 22nd century, and Maxim implies all humans are considerably improved physically by that time (he also states later in the novel that prolonged exposure to the climate of Saraksh has weakened him). However, the novella Space Mowgli (aka The Kid, "Малыш") is set in the same time period (in-universe), and its characters do not seem to be as developed physically as Maxim (if they were, they wouldn't be as challenged when playing with the Kid), which leaves two possibilities: 

This is from Wilson's The Triple Thinkers (Amazon link). You can see the section of interest in the Preface, page ix. Conveniently, the preview includes that page, so you can view it for free (although without as much context as you might like). The source can be found relatively easily, with a clear citation, from Wikiquote. It's always worth checking there, or searching through it using Google to see if you can find an entry in Wikiquote—they tend to be quite reliable. 

George has certainly made many references and homages in A Song of Ice and Fire. However, the only direct mention I can find of Dante by Martin is the following: 

So the story is of how a poor widow gave all she had to the church and therefore was view as giving the most of all those that had donated. Without further context, I am guessing the boy in Don Juan made a similar gesture of giving all he had to something or someone. 

I.e. here we have the classic story of Desire making someone fall in love and then die because they couldn't be loved back. I think the key difference between Vassily and Koschei in this case is dreams versus desire, respectively. I'm not quite sure where to draw the line between the two in this case, but if we were to accept that the duke's daughter was only a dream for Vassily, then we don't need to involve Desire with another plot to bring a man to his doom. The choice of words in this panel is what drives my theory: 

(image by Loganberry of Wikipedia; public domain) It's not a fictitious name invented for the book; it's an area near where Richard Adams lived as a child: 

Seems like a pretty convincing trend. Conveniently, all were narrated by Stephen Fry, so it seems that the costs would be relatively constant (i.e. a similar cost per hour of recording). Of course, it's impossible to know exactly how the business model for these audiobooks works without inside knowledge, but it's reasonable to speculate that Fry's payments for each book would be proportional to the length of time needed to record them, so the cost of the product to the consumer would scale accordingly. I would conjecture also that Stephen Fry's narration contributes to the high cost of the HP audiobooks relative to the novels, considering he's a celebrity rather than an unknown voice actor. Certainly, demand would increase knowing that Stephen Fry narrated, and I imagine he is also able to command a greater wage than an unknown voice actor. RR Voice has an interesting article which goes into some of the many ways that audiobook narrators would charge for their work, such as royalty splits and per finished hour payments (i.e. £X for every hour of recording given to the customer). Although I can't really say much more without going too far into the realm of speculation, it does appear from the example of Harry Potter that the prices often do correlate with the production cost to a reasonable degree. However, with the many different ways of charging for production, and the difficulty of knowing how much consumers will pay for a certain audiobook, it's difficult to make any more judgements than just observing the link with length. 

So how I would interpret the line is that since the child's right hand is wasted, that is a "risk" to try to get the button away from his left. The child is playing a game with themselves the "desired result" being the right hand winning the button from the left. 

George also a series of short stories set in what is known as the "Thousand Worlds". So while he says the two works are not the same world, they still might be connected... Alas, he has shot down this theory too... 

Watership Down is a real place in Hampshire that just happens to sound as if there is some connection to water. 

As you suggest, Downland is a primarily English term for hills, derived from the Celtic. Therefore, the name does make quite a lot of sense - after all, rabbits do love hills! 

Bashō never wrote that haiku. The haiku is not listed on PoemHunter or in his list of works on Wikipedia, which starts to seem suspicious, but then I found authoritative confirmation at MI6 HQ:
