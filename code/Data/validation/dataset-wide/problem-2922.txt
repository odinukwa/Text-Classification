Robots can become very intelligent. So suppose in future they are there and looks and behave a bit like humans. What question could be asked by which you can decide whether it is a robot or not? 

For a lot of feelings it looks clear to me that a thought preceded it. Like when I think of the possibility of war I get afraid. But imagine the case when it is very cold, is the feeling of having cold preceded by the thought that it is cold or could you feel cold without thinking about it? 

I think it is a kind of idealism like that of Berkeley. But can this statement also belong to phenomenology of Husserl or of the philosophy of Kant or is there perhaps a better philosopher for this? 

There is time as an interval between two events but you could also state that time itself has a certain duration (it passes). Now in physics it is not always very common to see time as something that has a duration. ' So to make that statement solid one should find a way to work it out that it is an illusion but how can you do that? 

Some people like to live in the moment, or in the now. That is possible a more psychological way of interpreting a moment. But physically seen, does this contain a time lap? So is it actually possible to live in the now? Or is the Planck time (5.39 × 10 −44 s) the time lap which defines 'now'? Or when it is 17:00 h, does that moment has a time lap? Perhaps mathematically it could have a now, because 17:00 seems to be very exact. But in practice, regarding special relativity, a clock can't indicate the time precisely 17:00 because that would also imply that there is an infinite number of decimals which due to all motions can't stay zero. Or can they? 

Hegel explains in his works how the Geist is evolving during history towards a kind of consciousfreedom. It seems to me initially that in the end our own minds has evolved to a rational God, but I'm not sure of this. But in what religion is the interpretation of a God similar to the definition of Geist according to Hegel? 

Perhaps more a physics question, but there is also a philosophical question why physics validate all measurements as the same. Of course one could ask why should one particular measurement be the only 'real' one. Of course this is all about special relativity. But a bit in line of Ockhams'razor one could also suggest that the measurement with the less variable parameters should be the most right one. But if one measure the length of something with a ruler just laying it besides it, it should be a more accurate measurement of the length of something than of the measurement of a observer in motion relative to that length. But in physics both measurement are equal in validity according to SR. Only light is absolute. So the question is, isn't a measurement with less variable parameters not more accurate than one that is depending on the observers'conditions? 

Socrates was finally sentenced to death because his judges declared that he spoiled youth by his teachings and that he learned other Gods. But what precisely did he teach? 

In the early days, atoms existed according to Democritos. I think Democrites just hypothesized this to build up his world view. Probably there would have been also philosophers who claimed that everything was divisible to infinity (was perhaps Aristotle such a person?) But when asking in nowadays physics it is said that elementary particles can't be divided anymore, because the just decay in certain given other particles. But is this view of nowadays physics the truth? There are muons electrons quarks and neutrino's which can't be divided anymore. But why should this be true? Why can't a particle be split into infinity? Ok, it is probably hard to do so, but is there a more profound 'law' which does state this view? 

Descartes teached that because he thinks therefor he is. But did he tell something about the question whether there are gaps between thoughts? So probably we could not exist between those gaps? Or wasn't it possible not to think or was thinking just a quality a human posesses? 

Using mathematics a lot of 'laws' of nature are discovered, like the Higgsboson gravitational waves Diracs anti-matter etc. But if something like mathematics can predict how nature or reality 'should be' and is what does it say about the nature and reality. I sometimes think that if mathematics is usefull than the reality is perhaps symmetric and in balance or something like that. But is maths just putting a model on nature and you will find what you are looking for with the instruments and maths you use or does it really say something about nature? 

According to his theory there is only one substance and that is God/Nature. But if God is only good can there be any evil or bad behavior etc.? 

Because God wants us to be totally involved. So human have free will, can talk, behave and act; God wants our cooperation, because for a relation two persons are needed. Nevertheless God can give us something that we did't ask for, but this isn't always the case. 

With levels I mean different 'perspectives' on a subject/happening. For example, all things have color. When we see a green tree we say this tree is green. So from this level the tree is green. But for a physicist the tree has no color it only appears as a color but in fact they are waves reflected by the tree are 'mentioned' green. So for a phycisist only waves 'are'. Now there is a mathematical physicist and says, no that are no waves that are fields and vectors and a string-theorist says that the tree is a bundle of strings. And perhaps even a synesthesist would say the tree is color 6. Perhaps you could go on and on. The question is now whether these 'beings' are valid or not. Can 'beings' who are not really contradictory be all true in their own field/level or -is- there a real being what prohibit the other beings? See also min 34 $URL$ 

I am a mathematics student and am curious about how research in philosophy is done. In mathematics, let's say we have a geometric object, this object has various representations and each representation can make it easier to see some specific feature, for example: A geometric object could be the set of zeroes from a system of equations, it could be a set of distances from a certain set of points in a certain way, a category, etc. In there, these are some kinds of most basic methods of research, each one revealing in a certain way. Are there such things in philosophical research? From my naive view until now, it seems that metaphysics, epistemology, ontology, dialetic, logic, etc are these most basic methods and they can be combined to yield additional insights. Is that correct? I'm not sure if the tagging is adequate. If not, feel free to correct it. 

I guess everyone knows Plato's allegory of the cave. He assumes people are in caves and then, he suggests that there is a possibility of "going out of the caves", gaining several nice properties with this. Do we have evidence that he noticed that we could "get out of a cave" and still be inside another "cave"? And that there could be an arbitrary number of nested caves? 

When I was a kid, I remind that I had a strange type of game - I was mostly concerned of annoying other persons. Whenever they assumed something, I asked why, and then when they aswered, I asked why again, and then I kept asking why until the person was annoyed. There was a point where the person could not provide an answer to the why's, I always wondered if our knowledge behaves this way: This way of having an infinite series of why's and at some point, a nullity of answers. So, is this infinity of questions a problem somehow? Have someone thought about it? 

In the near past, I've read about the work of Tversky and Kahneman, the text said that they presented their work to a famous american philosopher (without mentioning names) and he said that he wasn't interested in a philosophy of stupidness. From what I know, Kahneman and Tversky wrote about biases, not specifically stupidness. So, is there someone else who wrote some philosophy of stupidness? 

This is something that attracted my attention several times, but I never heard of anyone who wrote about a philosophy of poorness, I guess Marx would be the nearest I've heard of, are there other ones who wrote about it? 

I am a student of mathematics, that afirmation of the question I propose seems plausible to me. But I remember that some days ago, I was talking to a friend and he said that such terms are not exactly consequences of a quantitative method. Is that feasible? I don't remember perfectly if he said that one is not consequence of another or if it was about somethings that don't need to be quantified. But I would like to know about my initial question. Note: I have no idea of what tags should be used for this question - any edit is welcome. 

Suppose you have two theories: T₁,T₂. Each one has a proposition that makes the other become contradictory. Question 1: Is it always possible to find a theory T₃ which conciliates both theory, that is: "removes the contradiction"? Question 2: Supposing the answer to the first question is affirmative, does it imply that we can prove anything to be true? I know the answer with logic, this will depend on the axioms and rules of inference of the logic you are using. But how they face this problem with Derrida's conception of languange? 

I've been thinking a bit about the core argument of social constructionism. Whenever I see the argument being employed, it seems that it means that if something is a social construction, then this thing is not too legitimate. This seems to agree a bit with Hacking here. I've noticed that I could take the argument itself and write: "The idea of social construction is a social construction. Then the idea of social construction is not too legitimate." At least for me, this seems to be a logical problem: An instance of the liar's paradox, with the argument eating itself. Is it actually a problem or the argument is built in an ideological framework unbeknownst to me in which this problem could be eliminated? I know that there are logics that deal with self-reference. But I don't know if the person who created the concept worked with these logics and conscientiously created the concept using it or if he/she didn't see that one could apply the argument to itself. 

I'm still in the beginning of the book and I've read this in the introduction, so what's so speculative in rationalists metaphysics? 

In mathematics, it seems that when we try to find relations about objects we are forced to set a unique object as a basis for the construction of each other object. For example: take one rectangle and define It's area as b•h, now if you take a line through Its center, it will allow you to cut the rectangle in two having its area divided in two pieces (b•h/2). Now if you rotate the line in a way that it passes through two vertices of the rectangle, then you have a triangle and it has the same area: (b•h/2). Now for the area of the circle, we need to make a comparison between what we made and we can do that by inscribing a regular polygon and taking the limit of its sides to infinity, that is: it's measure will depend on the sum of a infinity of triangles. Even in integral calculus, the area under the curves is defined as the sum of an infinity of rectangles, consequently: An infinity of triangles. And hence, the triangle seems to be the most basic object found when building these relations. Does this effect have a name? Has someone written about it? If yes, who? 

I don't understand how the fail to settle all disputes implies that one couldn't settle many of them. The only possibility I see is using the meaning of "all" as "all disputes of a certain class" as such that this class does not contain all possible disputes.
