Personally, I would just give notice just like you would ordinarily do. Tell him that you are forming your own company if you wish. Let him float the idea of providing some support until he can get a new staff up to you instead of proosing it. It really isn't up to you to ensure that the prior employer's work gets done any time you leave. It is theirs. If you are counting on this business to help launch your new company, I would rethink that idea. 

Personally if someone did this to me, I would consult a lawyer to get him to review my old contract and the proposed new one. If he agrees that you will not have to pay back money, I would ask him to write a letter stating that, in his legal opinion, you have no obligation to pay any money on resignation and then turn in a copy of that letter with my resignation rather than signing the new contract. That money spent for legal advice will be some of the best money you ever spend. He is relying on you to not know your legal rights or not be willing to pay to defend yourself or that the threat will scare you into staying. If he knows you have consulted legal counsel, he is less likely to try anything when you quit. Bullies look for easy targets. They will push far harder on people without legal representation. They don't actually want to spend a lot of money on a suit they will lose. One thing I would not do is sign a new contract with this person unless I would starve to death without this job. If someone descends to this level of threat, then there is no way I would consider continuing to work for him if I had the skill set to get another job. 

This is something I would likely bring directly to HR. It is not in the company's best interests to have people arguing politics on company time. Most HR people would put a stop to this immediately as politics and religion have no place in the work world (unless you are a political or religious organization of course). 

I'd say you need to look in the mirror for the problem. This isn't passive-aggression (well it is on your part), it isn't fluff, it isn't any of the negative things you ascribe to it. You are so tied to your unconventional communication style, you can't see that you are sabotaging yourself with it. You are making them uncomfortable with your hostility to answering in anything more than monosyllables. I'd even bet your tone is annoyed at having to go through these stupid hoops to get hired. People are not expected in interviews to answer with one word. You are supposed to be selling yourself not annoying people. Making people who have the power to decide if you will get hired uncomfortable or annoyed with you is a losing situation for you. 

Generally a change like this means something very bad is going on in his personal life. Someone close to him may have died or been diagnosed with a serious disease, he might be going through a divorce or he might have been diagnosed with something. I bring up these things because that is the level of thing you may have to deal with if you choose to talk to him and he decides to confide. So be aware that you might be opening a can of worms you don't want to get into or are not prepared to handle if you ask about it. I personally have asked coworkers about something that seems to be upsetting them and have had to help them get through a child with cancer, a spouse with cancer, a terminal diagnosis for themselves (she died about 8 months later and I was one of only four people at the office who knew of her disease and the only one who knew it was terminal.) and a very messy divorce. You take a real risk when you ask about this type of sadness that you will get more than you wanted to deal with. I have been through many of these types of things myself being widowed and having a great niece with cancer, etc. So I am prepared to deal with whatever a person might bring up. If you are not (as I was not in my twenties), it may be best to stay quiet and simply try to make sure that you don't add to this person's stress by creating work issues for them. Generally when I see symptoms like this, I usually make sure that we are in a private place and say something along the lines of, "Are you OK? You seems very sad. Is there anything I can do to help?" Now this accomplishes two things. First, it lets him know that people are noticing which he might not want if he doesn't want to tell and he can then be more careful about his behavior. Next it lets him know that you are willing to help which can be important when someone is in a personal mess. However, if he hasn't made a general announcement of a problem, he will likely say he is fine. That's ok, we don't owe a coworker a description of our personal problems. That doesn't mean it was wrong to ask if he was OK, even when they don't want to tell you the problem, people like to know others are concerned for them. Just be aware that OK doesn't necessarily really mean OK. Look for ways you can relieve work stress on him if he continues to look sad. Sometimes the best way you can help is by not creating more stress. And don't continue to ask. If he chooses to talk or breaks down, be prepared to handle that and understand that in general this type of conversation is confidential. Don't blab about it to others in the office. If he chooses to talk that is a big sign of being trusted. Be worthy of that trust. 

In the workplace, very often managers will make choices that subordinates don't agree with. Sometimes there are no branches of the decision tree that everyone will go along with. But a Technical lead or a manager is paid to make the decisions and the final call is hers or his. It's important to understand that because there is a 100% chance you will eventually need to implement decisions you don't agree with. The challenge is how to manage up to get better decisions made so that you have to do fewer things you don't agree with. The first thing is to be aware of is that you are never going to get a manager to agree with a change you propose if she or he does not respect you professionally. So your first task is to gain the trust of the manager. You gain that trust by delivering the work with the best quality you can under the particular circumstances. You gain that trust by letting the manager know when there is a problem headed his way before someone from above asks him or her about it. You gain that trust by not being a pain to work with (i.e., you do things like timesheets and project management tasks without him having to bug you, you don't embarrass him in from of his peers, subordinates and organizational superiors). And you gain that trust by supporting his or her decisions. No, that last doesn't mean that you can't disagree, but that once the time for objections is past, you step up and make the decision work. You don't complain about them being his or her back either. OK suppose you do have your manager's trust. The next part is trickier. You have to be aware of timing when bring up objections. And you have to be careful about your tone of voice and the language you choose to use. No one likes to be told they are stupid and wrong and the decision will become more set in stone if you present your objection in way that makes the manager feel disrespected. The best time to get in your input is before a decision is made and announced. Now granted, sometimes a decision, like possibly this one, comes as a complete surprise. But when you know that someone is considering methods or you know there is a particular decision point coming up, that is the time to get information to them to help them choose the way you want to them to choose. After a decision is publicly announced is never the best time to dispute it. If it is just to the team, there is still a chance the decision can be reversed, but if the decision has been announced to Clients, senior managers or to others outside your group, then it is usually best to back off unless the decision is critically wrong. By critically wrong, I mean the decision cannot be implemented without spending a great deal of money or it might cost the company a lot of business. I do not mean it might be inconvenient for you personally. Now personality type comes into this, too. Some personality types are more amenable to objections than others. I once had a boss who was so rules-based (and one of his rules was that he set the rules) that there was no pushing back on anything no matter how bone-headed. He was a smart guy and I learned a lot from him and he rarely made a truly stupid mistake because he knew his profession in far more depth than I did, but I hated every minute of working with him. If you have that kind of boss, the best you can do is follow his lead until he gets replaced, learn what you don't want to be when you are a manager, and/or move on (follow his lead until you move on though, you can often get a terrific recommendation from this sort of person). Other personality types are more willing to listen. But you have to know when to catch them. Sometimes the best time to get something you wanted done is after there was a major problem in the very area that you want to change (don't be an "I told you so" person here, that won't help.). Others are best approached only when things are going well. It can help a great deal to read about personality types to understand the best way to approach someone. It can also help a great deal to read about language use. I have often seen issues where two people were arguing about two completely separate issues and neither one noticed. If your boss isn't hearing you, then read about language styles. This can be particularly true if the two of you are different genders or come from different cultures. (if anyone wants help in understanding the male/female differnt communication styles, I highly recommend: $URL$ When you do have to object to a particular decision, then you need to present your ideas not only in technical terms, but in business terms. Nothing will get a manager's attention faster than costs (either measurable cost savings with the alternative suggestion or extra costs to implement something you disagree with.) Cost are not all monetary, although leading with those helps. Consider time, risks (risk of introducing new bugs, security risks, risks of losing customers,etc). Learn to do a formal decision analysis. Managers deal better with hard numbers than fuzzy, intangible concepts. Sometimes you can lead someone to a different decision by simple questioning about the mechanics of implementing the decision. By asking questions that lead them to see the problems, you are not creating a negative by objecting. For instance in your case with the enums, I might have pointed out that we have 237 already in the code and did he want us to redo those or simply refrain from using them in the future. If we do redo them, what QA process do we need to follow? If some of those enums are in a part of the code without unit tests, did he want you to write those tests first? It might take 1500 hours to fix all of those, what priority should we put on fixing them, what should we push to a later sprint to be able to have the time to do that, etc. The key to this technique is to be very sincere. You are trying to get clarity around implementing, not objecting. And you do actually need most of those answers in order to implement. You know you have won when he or she says, "Hold on on that for a bit, I need to think about this some more." Pick your battles carefully though. You want to concentrate only on the truly critical stuff. If you object to everything, then you will get labeled troublemaker in her or her mind and you won't be listened to when it is important. The more senior you are in the profession and the more trust you have gained, the more things you will able able to steer in the direction you want. I almost always get asked before a decision to give input these days. I worked hard to get to that position, but we hardly ever do anything I seriously object to, now. You will have to work to get to that place as well. But as you start out, truly only pick really big battles to fight.
