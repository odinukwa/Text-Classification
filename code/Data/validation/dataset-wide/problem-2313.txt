The biggest danger in hiking alone is that any sort of injury or illness can very quickly put you in a situation where your life is at risk. anything which immobilises you in the wilderness is potentially quite dangerous. This is exacerbate in winter where hypothermia can very easily kill you overnight if you are unable to find shelter. Say you break your ankle. If you are in a group they can put up a tent and get you into sleeping bag and make sure you keep fed and hydrated while other members of the group go off to get help. There is also the fact that a group can look after each other and help avoid dangerous situations in the first place by cross checking navigation and watching each other for signs of fatigue and hypothermia, dehydration ect. This isn't to say that hiking alone is a bad idea but you need to be aware of the risks and how to mitigate them. One very important thing is to let someone trustworthy know your intended route and when you expect to be back, that way if something does go wrong someone will know you are missing and where to look for you. Also you need to be a lot more aware of potential risks as even a minor mishap can very quickly escalate and also make sure that your skills and equipment are up to the environment and route. 

From the sales material you quote it sounds like the 'wood' in question has been vacuum stabilised. This involves completely saturating the wood with a polymer resin so it is in effect more like a plastic composite than natural wood but retains the grain and appearance of wood. As long as the process has bee carried out correctly this should make the material pretty much impervious to moisture and normal rain and weather shouldn't be a problem. Here it sounds like this material has been chosen for aesthetic reasons ie customers want a bow that looks like it is made from wood but for all practical purposes it is a polymer composite material. 

In general every individual has a natural walking cadence (steps per minute) and they vary their actual speed by increasing or decreasing stride length. Even amongst a very fit group the most comfortable natural pace will vary and some people will be built for speed on the flat while some stroll up brutal hills others will happily carry their own bodyweight in kit at a steady pace over any terrain. However the degree to which you can vary pace is limited and there is a point where your strides are uncomfortably long or (as in this case) short to maintain an efficient gait. The main reason for this is that natural walking is effectively a whole series of fallings forward ie you aren't pulling yourself forward with your feet you are swinging your centre of mass forward and moving your feet to maintain balance. So your natural gait is a lot like a pendulum and like a pendulum it has a natural frequency. As this happens you are transferring energy around a bit like a slinky falling down some steps, although some energy is lost each step a natural walking pace will conserve quite a lot from one to the next. If you have to move too slowly the your gait becomes a sequence of individual steps rather than a smooth flow from one stance to another and rather than a recycling the energy of each step you end up using energy to hold yourself back and check your stride. This is exacerbated if you are carrying a pack as you end up accelerating and decelerating it with every step rather than keeping your centre of mass moving at a fairly constant velocity. In practice if you are walking with someone who is struggling it is best for everybody for you to take some of their gear and/or for you to continue at your own pace for a while and then stop and wait for them. Also if someone is having trouble have a group rest and find out if there is any underlying reason why they are struggling, if they are carrying too much weight, are dehydrated, hungry ete etc it is better for the group as a whole to solve that issue than let them struggle even if you have to push them to admit it. Most people will need to have this explained to them and will not admit a problem unless pressed. 

To put the upper limits into context 25kg comes up a lot in a military context and is often quoted as a standard combat load. For example 25kg is the load for the hill phase of British special forces selection, albeit held over very severe terrain distance and time constraints and for the infantry annual fitness test. Both tests require a pace a bit above normal walking pace. 25kg is also often quoted for historical examples from roman legionaries to medieval knights. It is also certainly possible to carry much greater loads over moderate distances and it is entirely possible to hike with a pack that you can struggle to pick up. However what is actually sensible and practical very much comes down to personal preference in the context of your general level of fitness and conditioning as well as the terrain you are moving over. A load which is comfortable on a proper trail can be crippling on hilly or broken ground. As with al things it comes down to finding the compromise which works for you, lighter kit makes for easier and more comfortable walking but you might find that a little extra weight in terms of a bigger tent or nicer food is well worth it. My experience is that you have an upper limit of what is reasonably comfortable and you tailor that to get the balance of comfort, speed and range that you want for your trip. 

For the UK in spring where you expect river crossings there is an argument for just using boots which dry fast eg unlined fabric and leather construction as these also have the advantage of being more breathable in general. If that is not to your taste then the traditional canvas and rubber plimsoles are as good as anything for river crossings as the pack up small and light 

I agree that good quality para cord (look for 550 cord from a reputable supplier) is the best general purpose solution. It is strong enough that you could just about abseil off it with nothing else than a couple of carabiners in an absolute life or death situation or use it as a safety line for crossing a river or lowering your pack over a steep incline or canyon wall etc. It also has a multitude of other uses from bootlaces to cordage for shelter building and you can separate the inner threads to use as fishing line or sewing thread for repairs. You can also twist or braid it together to make a stronger rope or straps for an improvised pack. It is light enough that you can stuff a few hundred feet of it into a pocket and forget about it. For survival use it is probably best to go for high visibility orange, yellow or red that way if you are waiting for rescue in dense terrain you can string it across trails or open spaces to guide rescuers to your location. It should go without saying that if you are doing any sort of climbing, abseiling etc in anything other than a dire emergency you really do need to right tools and knowledge for the situation in hand. It is also worth adding that a knowledge of the fundamental principals of cordage, ropes and knots is one of the most basis survival skills. 

A hut like this should at least be dry and reasonably sheltered so you might get draughts but not direct driving winds. This means that you can afford to focus on warmth rather than more general shelter if you are confident that you can reach a hut every night. In this sort of context down sleeping bags are attractive as they offer excellent warmth and comfort for low weight. Their downside is that performance drops off sharply when they get damp but if you pack it in a drybag or heavy duty plastic bag during the day and have a soft screen for any wind driven rain you should be fine. If you are sleeping in even the most basic huts you can certainly do away with a tent and, if you want, put some of that saved weight and bulk into a warmer sleeping bag. If you are worried about wind driven rain getting into the hut the best option is to baffle the door with something like a panel of parachute silk, eve with only 3 sides to your shelter you won't need a fully waterproof tarp. If you can use an open fire outside the hut then you have the option of either heating some rocks or sand and bringing them into the hut as central heating or putting the embers from your fire in a cooking pot to do the same thing. Similarly leaving a candle to burn overnight can take the edge off the cold if there aren't too many draughts. In the absence of anything else placing your pack across the threshold of the door will cut out low level draughts a lot. If it is permissible to use open fires a slow burning fire with a reflector can be very effective in heating an open shelter. Ultimately comfortable sleep is a lot to do with personal preference and it is worth getting a sense of how warm you feel in a given sleeping bag before you go on a long trek. 

Static rope may not be that much more expensive than equivalent tape and is certainly a lot more versatile. In particular rope gives you a lot more options for reliable knots which are also be familiar from climbing rope use. Many people consider any knot in tape to be a bit suspect. The range of knots may come into play when rigging more complex anchors or when you want to back up the main anchor. In the context of the this specific question it may be that there are some specific techniques that the course is demonstrating. It's worth bearing in mind that single pitch anchors can end up being more complex than just joining two pieces of protection and specific knots may be important for equalisation. Long lengths of tape can also get in a horrible tangle especially in terms of keeping it flat whereas rope is a bit better at untwisting itself, being round rather than flat. Also for a very long anchor chain webbing may have more stretch than a static rope and while this is not automatically bad it can add an extra element of unpredictability. Of course there is also a lot of weight behind what people know to work, especially in terms of safety, so it may be that this course specifies rope because it is tried and tested for they way they do things. 

Depending on how much you need you can get a variety of food grade plastic bottles for carrying liquids. To avoid drips probably the best option is a squeeze type bottle with both a nozzle and a screw top lid. The combination of a screw top and insert squirt nozzle gives a good combination of ease of refilling, seal security and ease of use with minimal dripping. You can also get these in multiples of 10 or 15ml so they are good for small quantities. 

I tend to treat emergency first aid and everyday 'maintenance' as separate requirements and I think that this helps to keep things rationalised and logical. The everyday kit is aimed at treating the normal problems you might get over a few days: this fits in a small wallet for short trips. A lot of these things are personal preference and what you find works for you, plus of course any regular or emergency medication you may need for known medical conditions. In some cases it may be sensible to break this down further into quick access stuff for cuts etc eg in a small wallet and more everyday items packed elsewhere. 

The simplest way of smelting iron is a bloomery furnace. This is essentially a beehive shaped structure, covered in clay and containing alternating layers of charcoal and iron ore with openings top and bottom to allow a controlled airflow through the stack. Iron ore comes in several forms but is essentially various iron oxides mixed with silicates. The chemistry behind a bloomery furnace is that the burning charcoal creates both a high temperature and a carbon rich atmosphere inside the furnace in which oxygen is taken away from the iron to react with the carbon (reduction). At the end of the burn the furnace is taken apart and if the process is successful there should be a porous mass of metallic iron mixed with silicate slag, called a 'bloom'. Depending on the quality of the ore and the exact conditions in the furnace there may also be a certain amount of steel of varying carbon content. This bloom must them be re heated in a forge and repeatedly hammered and folded to create a usable material. The end product of this 'fining' process is wrought iorn, a composite of more or less pure metallic iron interspersed with fine fibres of silicates. This can either be used as it is with similar properties to mild steel or further processed by carburisation to make steel. A development of this process involves a rather more sophisticated furnace fed with forced air which both reduces the ore and diffuses carbon into the metal, creating cast iron which has a significant carbon content (around 3-5%) and consequently a low enough melting point (around 1200C) to be cast. Usually the raw 'pig iron' from a furnace needs to be remelted to produce a usable pure material. Producing good quality steel requires additional steps as you need to precisely control the carbon content of the resulting alloy. 

In terms of the items on the list it all seems entirely reasonable and an overall pack weight is not by any means ridiculous, although it is in the regions where shaving a few kg is likely to make quite a big difference in overall comfort. It is fairly likely that your tent is the heaviest single item, a two person tent intended for car camping can be pretty weighty but if that's what you've got you may not wan to buy a new one to save a few kg. However you can look at whether all of the bits of the tend are entirely necessary, for example carrying spare tent pegs for a 2 day trip is definitely wasted weight. Indeed if you are hiking in a forest you may not need any pegs at all as you can just use sticks. Similarly if you are camping in a forest just a tarp may be entirely adequate (certainly don't take both) Overall a good approach is to to at least one trial run even if it is just a few hours walk followed by camping for a night in your garden this will give you a much better idea of what you really do need. It is also worth noting that this is your decision some people will go to great lengths to shave every possible gram while others will carry a bit extra for the sake of a few luxuries to make the whole exercise more enjoyable. But still there is no point carrying things you absolutely don't need eg cut a small piece off a bar of soap rather than taking a whole bar and take a travel sized tube of toothpaste indeed but a few plastic tubes or jars for things like sunscreen and insect repellent that you will only use a tiny amount of. Also consider getting a cheap old style phone with a battery life which will last the entire trip rather than a smartphone which needs constant recharging. Similarity one set of batteries will last in your torch for a 3 day hike, especially if you get an LED one with a low intensity setting. Think about whether you really need a stove and mess kit you could just have food t hat doesn't need cooking, bread, cheese, dried fruit, nuts and preserved sausage (of which Poland has an amazing selection) should see you through a 3 day hike and will keep for that length of time (I would actually rather eat this sort of thing on a hike than rehydrated gunk). If you absolutely must have hot drinks then a tiny solid fuel or alcohol stove with the bare minimum of fuel should be adequate. I suspect from your list that you could shave a couple of kg by taking smaller sizes or lighter versions of things and ditching a few unnecessary items.
