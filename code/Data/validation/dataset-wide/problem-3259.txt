It was more symbolic than real. Churchill didn't want to have an agreement where one party had a "0%" interest in a country. But Stalin consistently exceeded "his" percentages. The Soviets' "90%" interest in Romania was actually 100%; and its "75% interest in Bulgaria was more like 90%. On the other hand, the Soviets' influence in Greece, while a minority, was more than "10%. Hungary was supposed to be split 50-50 Soviet and western allies, but became a Soviet satellite. Only Yugoslavia was "split" 50-50, per the agreement, by its going its own way. 

Poland seems like the "invisible" party during the Seven Years' War Ostensibly, it was fought between France, Austria, and Russia on one side, and Prussia, plus Great Britain-Hannover on the other. Yet Poland was actually quite "involved," willy-nilly. 

A little bit of both, but mostly "nationalism." First of all, the will opposed a marriage of Charlotte to say a Frenchman or a German, (at least unless they happened to be British subjects like some Germans from Hannover). The idea then was that by marrying, a woman took on the nationality of her husband. So a foreign marriage would make her ineligible to inherit because she would, in effect, no longer be a British subject.* On the other hand, people of British and some "colonial" blood were accepted as "British" (demonstrated by British subjects), if the British elements clearly predominated. In this case, the non-British elements could be no more than half, and ideally no more than a quarter. The British subject part protected a lot of people of "mixed" blood. The British did not adopt the American standard of "one drop" regarding non-British blood, and were less racist than the Americans. British wills tended to be less explicit about things like skin color than say, American wills. ("Race" was not as everpresent an issue in British society as in American.) Clearly, testators wanted to keep their money out of the "wrong" hands, but they would use more "coded" language such as "British subject" in wills and other documents to accomplish this. Put another way, the dividing line for Britishers was "British" and "non-British," whereas for many Americans, it was "white," or "non-white." *Philosopher Samuel Johnson said that he would support his daughter as long as she remained single, but once she married, this support would cease so that her choice of a husband would basically be a choice of her standard of living. 

Frederick the Great was well regarded by slightly later military leaders such as Napoleon, and also the writer von Clausewitz, who admired both Frederick and Napoleon (the latter said of Frederick, "Gentlemen, if this man were still alive I would not be here.") Frederick was a personally brave commander who personally directed troops in battle and was known for the (in)famous line, "Churl, do you want to live forever?" While the battle of Rossbach, for instance, was won against numerical odds of 2 to 1 by a brilliant cavalry maneuver, Frederick personally directed the frontal "holding" attack that made the cavalry charge possible. Likewise at the battle of Leuthen, also fought against 2- to-1 odds, Frederick revived the oblique tactics first used by the Greek Thebans at Leuctra, against Sparta. 

Original answer: Anne Boleyn's PREFERENCE was for a "swordsman" rather than an "axeman." (This is different from my earlier, and now "retracted" statement that it was her request.) In the letter referenced in the question, the warden of the Tower of London reported that: "I have seen many men and also women executed, and that they have been in great sorrow, and to my knowledge this lady has much joy in death." The initiative appears to have come from Henry VIII, who seemed to anticipated that the swordsman would provide a less painful, and hence "preferred" death (unless they had discussed this beforehand, perhaps in another context). If so, he is a better man than I have given him credit for. That may be because she could then die kneeling upright, instead of with her head on the block. The Calais swordsman was chosen as the "best in class." Anne Boleyn was treated with more consideration than Mary Queen of Scots, who died with her head on the block, requiring TWO strokes of an axe, and also Catherine Howard, whom Henry also executed. 

Japanese quasi-colonialism in the 17th century mostly took place in Siam. There, the king had hired Japanese mercenaries to fight his battles, and these mercenaries threatened to take over the country from the early part of the century to 1630, until they were driven out. This was not a move that had the blessing of the Japanese government (from which the Japanese in Thailand were refugees), but more like the unchecked actions of the rogue Kwantung Army against China, centuries later. Java and the Philippines at the time were respectively Dutch and Spanish colonies. The Japanese established trading posts, there, with the blessings of the respective governments. Ditto for Annam, which was then under "native," not European rule. Edit: As J. Asia's link in his comment to the question points out, the Philippines' case was a "hybrid" of the Siam case on one hand, and the other cases on the other hand. That is, at various times, the Japanese there were welcomed by the local authorities, were in rebellion against those authorities, and later were assimilated by the local people. Japanese were much more welcome in modern Indonesia where the ruling Dutch "co-opted" fierce Japanese mercenaries for their own defense. 

In medieval times, an attacking army that had breached the walls/outer defense of a city, could enter it and overrun the defenders at relatively little cost. A major modern exception was the battle of Stalingrad. The city was "invaded" and largely overrrun, but the defenders were able to conduct a successful house-to-house, street-to-street defense in the remainder for two months until the Germans were surrounded by a counterattack. A similar thing occurred with the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. Polish rebels were able to hold parts of the city against greatly superior forces for two months, basically until their food and ammunition ran out. These battles constrasted greatly with other, less successful city defenses such as those of Rostov and Kharkov earlier in the same war. Why was that?
