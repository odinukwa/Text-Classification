You should not have any problem with regards to your rear derraileur. it will work with a wide variety of shifters. I've mixed many derraileurs within the Shimano brand across various product generations (usually from 7 speed to 10 speed). My limitation would be I've not used 11 speed equipment. There are some exceptions. For example the Shimano AX series derraileurs from the 80's will only work with friction shifters. . For the fronts, there is some information on Sheldon that indicates that there may be issues with brifters and your derraileur. I've used brifters with a very similar derrailuer to to the Tourney and it works ok. My only concern would be the triple cranks that you have and its compatibility to a triple front shifter indexing. That I cannot comment on 

As I understand FSA has all kinds of BB standards I don't have a sure answer for you, but if the splines match up and the crank sits securely then its a go. however you may find that due to crank/bb compatibility, the crank may actually sit further out or further in which will thus affect your chainline which then affects your shifting. Additionally the octalink is an older standard that is more difficult (at least for me) to find. Thus I'd honestly suggest that if you could, go the Shimano and their hollowtech 2 BB route. the BB is lighter, their hollowtech cranks are stiffer. you can feel a difference when you pedal, 

I second the suggestion to try the bike. My experience is as follows I'd always thought that having a bad and inflexible back that I would prefer to have my road bike handle bars more or less at the same height as my saddle. So two road bikes later, set up in this way and i've not been comfortable. In fact I've found more comfort in road bikes that have handle bars significantly lower than the saddle or in city bikes where the handle bars are significantly higher than the saddle. So big picture you'll need to try it.. and be open that you may not get it right the first time. I've spent loads of time playing with saddle position, handle bar position etc to find that perfect fit... I'm almost there... I think. Some considerations for you. If you are intent on city riding.. cycling on bicycle lanes and start-stopping in traffic and looking out for pedestrians, being as upright as possible is much more enjoyable / safer But if you're going for more or less uninterrupted speed and distance, a bike that gets you more hunched over will be more aerodynamic (especially over the 25 km/h) range I'm almost 180cm and prefer my slightly undersized 54cm bike over a more 'appropriate' 56cm 

Alternatively you could use a hybrid bicycle. 29" wheels with slightly knobby tyres, upright handlebar and some come with a front suspension, though I would select one without. 

Biking in the dark isn't as scary as biking at dawn/dusk When I first started bike commuting and the sun got low in the sky in the evenings, I'd leave work and try to get home before the sun went down. I didn't realize then that that was the absolute worst time to bike because the low sun meant that it was in driver's eyes, making bikes very difficult to see, even with lights and bright clothes, I just wanted to get home before it got dark. Now when the sun starts getting low, I wait until it sets before leaving work rather than try to beat the sun home. Once the sun sets, then my lights and reflectors are much more visible to cars. And with a decent headlight (which is much cheaper now than it used to be), seeing the road is not a problem at all. You still have to worry about nighttime visibility and watch for cars without headlights.... unlit cars are exceptionally hard to see against a background of headlights (and early in the night biking season, car drivers aren't used to turning on their headlights when leaving work so might drive quite some time before they notice) Bikes too are more difficult to see against a background of headlights/taillights, but even so, I'll still take biking in the dark over biking at sunrise/sunset when drivers are struggling to see against the sun. I've biked behind some cars at sunset where I couldn't see through their windshield myself due to dirt and/or scratches, so I really don't think they could see well enough to drive. Make sure you have adequate lights and reflectors. At a minimum, front and rear lights and reflectors, reflective spokes or tires, and reflective pedals or ankle bands (the motion lets cars know that you're a bike). I have a helmet headlight/taillight since I feel that the higher position makes it easier for cars to see me, especially if I'm stopped in traffic. 

I've tried using clip-on SPD platforms with regular SPD's, and found that those platforms are not very stable, can be difficult to snap in/out, and tend to fall off - they might be ok for a quick trip down the block, but won't stand up to a long commute. Platforms for other clipless styles (like Look) might be more stable, but I like SPD's for commuting since it's easy to walk in (some) SPD shoes. I also tried some combo pedals with a platform on one side and SPD clipless on the other (I think it was the Shimano M324), and found it too annoying to have to make sure the pedal was flipped around the right way. So finally I settled on these dual sided M424's, and have been pretty happy, the platform is comfortable for riding with regular shoes and while clipping in to the SPD's took a little practice because of the platform, it now feels as easy as clipping into bare SPD pedals. The SPD part is spring loaded and sticks up a little to make it easy to clip in, but it's not a very strong spring, so it folds down easily with regular shoes. It's not fully recessed under the platform when pushed down so it's possible that would cause some foot irritation on a long ride, but I've never had a problem with it. When I had a 4 mile commute, I used the platforms with regular street shoes almost exclusively (except for longer rides), now I have a 15 mile commute and use SPD biking shoes almost exclusively (except for shorter rides) and I'm pretty happy with the pedals either way. 

Apart from more obvious issues like mal adjusted front derrailleur where the chain would rub against it at certain positions (this should not occur when you are using the middle rear cog).... I once encountered a sandy gritty feel on the pedals on a bike with new but very cheap cassette and chain. after ascertaining it was not pedals (rotated the pedals alone by hand) and not the bottom bracket (I removed the chain and pedaled) I eventually found it to be the very new and very cheap cassette (we are talking those new 6 speed freewheels with the Shimano brand on the the largest cog) to be at fault. After a swap with a very old and used 6 speed freewheel (good quality circa 1979) the transmission was smooth as butter. On another time with my first foray of replacing chains, i had incorrectly placed it on the rear derrailleur jockey wheels. It then rubbed on a metal tab as it traveled through the jockey wheels Another time I had replaced a chain on an old 12 speed bike with a NOS 1970s Shimano chain that I think had rivets that sat too far proud that it rubbed against the cassette when one was in the taller (smaller) gears. Recently I adjusted a brand new aluminium road bike that when the bike was on big in front and small behind, the chain would rub on a weld seam at the point where the chain stay meets the seat stay. Another time I set the front derraileur too low and it was lightly brushing against the teeth of my crank chainring. 

Lets say you wish to replace a crank similar to yours and you cannot find the exact same crank as the one you have. BIG PICTURE: Unless you can find the exact same crank as yours, you'll need to purchase both a crank and matching bottom bracket. A guide for choosing a crank is listed below 

Measure the length of the Bottom Bracket shell. If it is 68mm or 73mm you're in good shape because thats a very common 'British' or 'ISO' size Count how many chainrings you have. 1? 2? or 3? 1 is a little tricky as its hard to come by, 2 (yours looks like 2) is commonly a 'road bike crank' and 3 is commonly a Mountain bike crank, though there are also 3 for road bike too. Count the teeth on the chainrings, or look for markings that may indicate the number of teeth (e.g.. 52teeth for the big one and 39teeth for the small chainring). If you like the gear ratios on your bike I suggest you stay with the same number with little deviation Count how many cogs you have at the rear. 6,7,8,9,10,11? Anything 9 and below will allow many interchangeable cranks. 10 and 11 will require specific 10speed or 11 speed cranks ( i suspect yours is 8, thus you could get a crank designed for 9 speed or less. don't get one for a 10 speeder or higher) Length of crank arm is less important for me. but you can select the same number as yours. 175mm With that information, I'd suggest to get a crank and matching bottom bracket for your bike. If you are using a square taper or Octalink or similar Bottom bracket your replacement crank may fit in it, but the length of the spindle of the bottom bracket may be incorrect for your crank.. so its very tricky. for example for square taper bottom brackets there are about 6 or more different spindle lengths. getting the length wrong could mean incorrect chainlines and issues with the drive train. So unless you get the exact same replacement crank.. you'll need to get a matching bb to the crank. At this juncture you might consider one of the HollowTech 2 cranks/bb from Shimano.. they work well and have less issues with spindle lengths though it may be challenging to get cranks for 9 speed or less unless they are old stocks. 

The rules further describe legal passing to avoid drafting penalties: an overtaking cyclist has to execute his pass within 15 seconds of entering the drafting zone, and the overtaken cyclist has to yield to the overtaking rider and drop out of the drafting zone before he can attempt to re-overtake if desired. The rules are slightly different for Elite competitors. 

It's hard to tell exactly what your angle is in that picture, but it looks like it's close to 60 degrees, so you're not getting much mechanical advantage from the yoke angle. If you can decrease this angle either by shortening the tranverse cable, or by widening the cantilever arms by sliding the brake shoes closer to the rim (which would help "flatten" the transverse cable, decreasing the yoke angle), you can gain significantly more mechanical advantage. You don't want just go for the greatest amount of mechanical advantage since you'll run out of available cable travel if it's too high, but you can definitely tune the brakes for greater mechanical advantage. There are additional cantilever adjustment tips on Shelden Brown's cantilever adjustment page. 

I'm not aware of a guide that compares all pedal styles, but there are not that many pedal types in common use and most styles are different enough from each other that you can easily tell the difference between them. 

Looks like a pair of Forté Carve pedals. Forté is a house brand of Performance Bicycles. I checked their website, but this particular model of pedal doesn't appear to be available any longer. 

The one time I took my bike overseas (in a hard-sided case), I regretted it. It's expensive ($200 each way on United) and inconvenient -- I had a hard time finding a cab that could hold us and our two bikes (we ended up taking 2 cabs to our first night hotel, fortunately our hotel helped us find a larger cab to take us to the start of our biking journey) and we had to deal with lugging them around on the last few (non-biking) days of our trip. A bike case takes a surprising amount of room in a small hotel room. Now I spend some time researching quality bike rentals and only carry my pedals and helmet along. It's much much more convenient. And if for some reason we change our plans (like, say, due to a injury), we don't have to figure out what to do with our bikes. If you plan on multiple overseas bike trips, another option would be to get a quality folding bike that fits into a suitcase sized case. A friend that does this regularly did that -- I think his bike is a Brompton. It's a pretty decent bike, I've ridden on some century rides with him and he has no trouble keeping up or doing the distance, so it seems like it would be a good option for travel, and if it saves $400 per trip in oversize bag fees, it wouldn't take many trips to pay for itself.
