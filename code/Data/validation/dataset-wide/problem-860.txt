This radius of the observable universe is measured by the comoving distance which is the same in every direction. Using CosmoCalc (a common tool for astronomers measuring cosmological parameters) you get 46 Gly for the comoving radial distance. 

For each template you can figure out the expected luminosity in the I-band and find the best match. For this method, it's really best to have more than one point for comparison. Since the near IR will likely be a blackbody from your evolved stellar population, you might want to see if you can supplement your I-band data with 2MASS observations. 

Take another photograph of the same field that is less exposed. (Doesn't matter if you do this by shortening the exposure time, decreasing the ISO, etc.) This will give you an image with far fewer stars so you can easily pattern match your images. 

For starbursts, their star formation rates are best estimated by a combination of their ultraviolet and infrared emission. [O II] and [O III] as well as Hydrogen recombination lines can be used to estimate star formation, but like the UV, these suffer from extinction. 

To get an order of magnitude estimate you can just use the total mass $M$ and luminosity $L$ of the star and an assumption of your fusion process. Main sequence stars fuse Hydrogen in to Helium through the proton-proton chain, which converts 0.7% of mass into energy. So the estimated lifetime of the star would just be: $0.007\frac{Mc^2}{L}$ ($c$ is the speed of light). For example, the sun would have a lifetime ~$10^{11}$ years, but that's assuming that all Hydrogen is being converted to Helium via the proton-proton chain. Given the scaling from observations of the Sun, you can use the mass-luminosity relation to estimate lifetimes for other main sequence stars. 

In a homogeneous and isotropic Universe (even if recent observations challenge this hypothesis), you can derive the Friedmann equations, which describe the evolution of the Hubble constant with time: $\frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H(t) = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}$ (with $c=1$) (Equation $1$) where $a=a(t)$ is the scale factor, $\dot{a}$ its derivative, $G$ the gravitational constant, $\rho$ the matter density, $\frac{k}{a^2}$ the spatial curvature (a parameter that describes the metric of the Universe), and $\Lambda$ the cosmological constant (an integration constant added by Einstein). It could be useful to rewrite the equation as: $H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}(\rho + \rho_{\Lambda}) - \frac{k}{a^2}$ where $\rho_{\Lambda} = \frac{\Lambda}{8 \pi G}$ is the "density of cosmological constant". We can also expand the matter density as $\rho = \rho_{matter} + \rho_{radiation}$. So we have a "total" density $\rho_{tot} = \rho_{matter} + \rho_{radiation} + \rho_{\Lambda}$. The destiny of the Universe depends on this amount. In case of $\rho_{tot} > \rho_{crit}$, or equivalently a closed Universe ($k=+1$), the equation $(1)$ becomes: $\dot a^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}\rho a^2 -1$ Which points out that the scale factor must have an upper limit $a_{max}$ ($\dot a^2$ must be positive). This in turn means that the second derivative $\ddot a$ of the scale factor must be negative, when approaching $a_{max}$, that is the scale factor function inverts its behavior: 

Or, that is equivalent, you can express your first equation (Stefan-Boltzmann), in Solar units as well (as shown here). Try it out just by your self: choose a mass, or observationally speaking, choose a luminosity. Then trace your line on the HR diagram, and find your star. That star has a defined temperature (spectral class), Mass and Radius as well. If you need the exact equations, feel free to ask please. Nice aim, anyway. Have fun! 

This is a spectral energy distribution (SED). Since astronomical objects don't emit light a single frequency an SED tells you how much emission you're getting across a range of frequencies. 

When stars transition from the main sequence core Hydrogen burning to core Helium burning they can experience Hydrogen shell burning. 

Black holes are created because the core of the star becomes very dense, not just because the star is massive. Prior to the creation of the black hole, the core is able to create enough outward pressure to prevent the core from gravitationally collapsing to the density needing to create a black hole. 

Vizier is a good resource for finding catalogs. Searching for "SMC+cepheid" I found a related paper (Udalski et al. 1999) with additional data $URL$ You can also look for "Similar Catalogs" though it may or may not be useful in this case. 

With the Tully Fisher relation, the inclination angle is determined from the major-minor axis ratio where $sin(i) = \sqrt{1-q^2} $ and q is the inverse of your ratio. You need to apply the sine of the angle to the rotational velocity because the measure is based on our line of sight observation which must be converted to the true 3D velocity. 

Yes, minerals can be observed using spectroscopy on a telescope, typically from their thermal signature. We can determine what type of mineral based on the elements that make up the mineral as well as the type of crystal structure, which will give a different spectral signature 

Asphalt roads do a great job at heating up cities! Mars can actually get up to 80F, so part of the challenge is preventing losing that heat in the low pressure atmosphere. 

Absolutely possible. There's nothing magical about a black hole. The gravitational pull of a black hole reaches as far as gravity would for another object of the same mass. If you replace the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, everything would continue to orbit it just as it currently does. Anything with mass has a gravitational force itself, and a black hole will attract anything with mass. Again, it's the same as our star having an effect on the Earth, and the Earth having an effect on the Moon. 

Temperature ($T_{eff}$) can be quite tricky to determine accurately as it interrelates to a number of other fundamental measurements. Firstly, remember that the spectrum we observe from stars are pin-point, they give us the entire overall result and not a specific location or part of the star. We need to dissect the various parts to arrive at the fundamental parameters. We arrive at our results by iterating the values of the fundamental parameters until a model spectrum matches the true spectrum we observe. The issue is, like you say, the existence of a whole lot of uncertainties. The first of these (although it doesn't have a large effect) is the Uncertainty Principle itself. This creates natural line broadening due to the emitted photon having a range of frequencies. The width of the line is determined by; $$\Delta E \approx \frac{h}{T_{decay}}$$ where $\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in the energy, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $T_{decay}$ is the amount of time the electron stays in a high energy state before decaying. Fundamental parameters The rotation of the star causes a Doppler shift effect on the line spectra making it broaden. The faster the rotation, the broader (yet smaller) the line. Like the Uncertainty Principle, this is natural broadening as it doesn't impact the abundance of any particular element in the star. Measuring the rotational velocity ($V_{proj}$) depends on both its axis of rotation and our line of sight to the star. Therefore, we use a combination of both velocity about the equator ($v_e$) and the star’s polar inclination ($i$) to determine the projected radial velocity; $$V_{proj} = v_e sin i$$ Temperature ($T_{eff}$)impacts wavelength in such a way that higher temperatures impart higher random motions on the atoms. When these photons collide with an atom, they can cause the atom to become ionised, i.e. lose an electron. Different energy levels (and therefore temperature) will create different abundances at the various ionisation stages of atoms. The temperature of the stellar photosphere decreases as we move away from the core. Therefore the line profile represents a range of temperatures. The wings of the line arise from deeper, hotter gas which displays a larger range of wavelengths due to increased motion. The higher the temperature, the broader the wings of the line profile ([Robinson 2007, pg 58][1]). Here you can see the effect of various temperature values on the synthetic spectral line of FE I 6593 A. Red: $T_{eff}$ = 4000K; Black: $T_{eff}$ = 5217K; Blue: $T_{eff}$ = 6000K; 

(Here $R_e$ is the so called effective radius). For completeness, another illuminating picture from here: 

I am not expert of GRBs, but this high-oscillation behavior seems a characteristics of GRBs: you can see few examples here. In fact, the BAT time resolution is very high ($\sim100\mu s$), then you can resolve very tiny details of the source's timing event. About the source variability, this is something more theoretical (so I can not be of much help), and there is no accepted theory, but qualitatively, in some models the gamma rays are produced by clumpy clouds of relativistically ejected material, which could account for the high variability indeed.

Not really. Quasars do indeed need a SMBH to be powered, and this is a necessary condition. But, Quasar phase only lasts for tens millions to few billions years. This means that, in a more recent universe, Quasars are turned off but the host galaxy... is still there. And the SMBH also do. This is exactly as our Galaxy case ($Sgr A^*$), where the evidences for the presence of a SMBH are among the strongest ones, but still no nuclear activity is present. However, there are tons of study to infer the proper amount of AGNs in the whole Universe by using luminosity functions. 

Not all models of dark energy assume it constant. However, when this is assumed true, dark energy is usually compared to the energy density of the vacuum. In other words, while the Universe expands, the dark energy increases proportionally, so its ratio with the Universe volume (the density) stays constant. Or, better, we generally believe those models where the dark energy is a constant because they fit better our observations of the Universe, in particular the Big Bang model, which describes how our Universe evolves. If you like some math, you can have it here. 

Microturbulence ($v_{mic}$) is the non-thermal localised random motion of the stellar atmosphere. It works in a similar way to temperature - an increase in the motion of atoms creates a wider range of wavelengths observed and therefore broader line profiles. In strong lines, saturation can occur when there aren’t any more photons to be absorbed. As microturbulence in these areas increases, it presents more opportunities for photons to be absorbed. This broadens the wings of the line profile increasing the overall strength of the line. We can use this fact to determine $v_{mic}$, by ensuring that the strength of the lines (equivalent width) have no correlation with their abundances. Finally, surface gravity which is a function of the star’s mass and size: $$log g = log M - 2 log R + 4.437$$ with $M, R$ being in solar units and $g$ in cgs. A star with a higher mass but smaller radius will invariably be denser and under greater pressure. By definition, denser gas has a higher number of atoms per unit of area (abundance), leading to stronger spectral lines. A gas under pressure provides more opportunities for free electrons to recombine with ionised atoms. For a given temperature, ionisation is expected to decrease with an increase of surface gravity, in turn increasing the abundance of atoms in the neutral or low ionisation states. The measuring of $T_{eff}$ As we've seen, there are a number of ways in which a spectrum of a star can be altered. The one you're interested in is temperature. As temperature is interrelated to all the other fundamental parameters, we need to treat them together as a whole and tease out the value of $T_{eff}$. We begin with a synthetic spectrum and modify its properties iteratively until it matches the shape of the star’s spectrum. Adjustments of one parameter will invariably affect the others. The spectra will match when the temperature, surface gravity, and microturbulence values (amongst others) are correct. This is obviously very time consuming although programs exist to help. Atmospheric properties can also be determined by other less time consuming means. Photometric colours can be used as a proxy for temperature, and absolute magnitudes for surface gravity. However, these determinations can suffer from inaccuracies due to interstellar extinction and are at best a close approximation. [1] Robinson, K. 2007, Spectroscopy: The Key to the Stars (Springer) 

As far as I know, this is an only theoretical object, it has never been observed. In the original paper from the authors, they provide some observable characteristics of these objects, like some peculiar emission lines. You can imagine the chemistry of such an object would be really unique. Here an article for a possible identification link 1, very recent work (2014). And here some calculations link2. 

The key for stellar classification is the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (or HRD for brevity), also know as the color-magnitude diagram. 

It is clear that the star undergoes a change in position. Then usually, the radial measurements go along with astrometrical measurements, to identify the position of the star along the planet's orbit. Of course, you need some conditions are verified to allow this measurement. First of all, you planet must be massive enough to bring a sensible change in the position of the star. Then your instrument must be sensible enough to resolve the tiny effect originated by this change. Possibly, also other conditions play a role, but I am not an expert (you can take a look at here). For a general comprehension, also a wiki for Methods of detecting exoplanets. 

This is a very well posed question, thanks! The problem is, we still don't know. What we suppose, is that dark matter came first. Primordial fluctuations of dark matter made the right conditions to accrete enough mass to build SMBHs, and then the surrounding galaxy. But still we don't know if, the SMBH comes from merging, of other SMBHs or galaxies, or from high massive BH that are called seed (of the order of $100\,M_{Sun}$). Perhaps, there are very recent developments, which could be known by the experts, but until few years ago, this was the scenario. About the mass issue, we could have a better reasoning if we think to the influence spheres. We discovered a relation between the SMBH mass and many bulge properties (i.e., the luminosity, the velocity dispersion, and others). This means that an object of the order of $\sim1$ pc, influences an object of the order of $\sim1$ kpc (maybe $\sim3$). Plus, the bulge structure is essential to the formation and characterization and classification of the host galaxy.
