This is a deep question about orientability of surfaces. The following is a bit technical. Non orientable surfaces like the Möbius strip don't have a front and back (this would be great to show your niece). Having a "front and back" means that the normal bundle of the surface is disconnected. A normal bundle (of a hyper surface) is a device for keeping track of local choices of "front and back" on a surface. In general, a surface (or hyper surface) lying in R^3 (or any orientable manifold) is orientable (meaning it admits a global choice of "left/right") if and only if its normal bundle is disconnected. The disconnectedness of the normal bundle means that a person living on the surface can make a global choice of "front back" at every point in the surface because this choice just amounts to choosing one of the components of the normal bundle. So if the notion of "right and left" seems more primitive than the notion of a surface having distinct sides, maybe this is a satisfying answer: Some surfaces admit a global choice of "right-left" so those surfaces have a normal bundle that has two components. Upon reflection, I find it unlikely that anyone considers "right-left" a more primitive notion than "front back," but I hope this answer still serves to show how deep and subtle are these seemingly intuitive notions about space. $URL$ $URL$ 

How do I know that the subject of my memories and me are the same person? I have a memory of waking up this morning. How do I know that the subject who woke up and the subject remembering it are the same person? 

From a thomistic point of view and given the doctrine of transcendentals, it seems that everything is intelligible (PSR formulation). But from the fact that everything is intelligible, how does it follow that "there is a sufficient reason or adequate necessary objective explanation for the being of whatever is and for all attributes of any being” (Bernard Wuellner, Dictionary of Scholastic Philosophy, p. 15)? How do these two formulations relate? If I say that being A or event X lacks a reason or explanation why is that unintelligible? *According to Edward Feser and his "Scholastic Metaphysics", "on the Scholastic doctrine of the transcendentals, being is convertible with truth (Cf. Bittle 1939, Part II; Feser 2009, pp. 31-36; Gardeil 1967, Chapter 4; Koren 1960, Chapter 2; Renard 1946, Section IV)". "A transcendental notion is one which is above every genus, common to all things and thus not restricted to any category or individual. Being is a transcendental insofar as everything real, whether a substance, an accident, or whatever, is a being of some sort or other. Truth is also a transcendental insofar as everything real is truly the thing it is. (Consider how “true” is often used in the sense of “real” or “genuine.”) Being and truth are convertible in the sense that they are the same thing considered under different aspects. Being is reality considered in itself, truth is reality considered in its relation to an intellect which grasps it. In other words, truth is just being considered as intelligible. Now if every being is in this sense true – and that this is Aquinas’s own view is uncontroversial – then it follows that every being is intelligible. And that is just what PSR says. (Cf. Gardeil 1967, pp. 139-42; Maritain 1939, pp. 97-105)". 

Note that if the lotto cards didn't decide what fruit to show until the experimenters picked which box to start scratching, then if Alice and Bob made their decisions at points in spacetime such, given the assumption of locality, no information about Alice's choice would be available at the position and time Bob made his own choice (and vice versa), then there would be no way to get the result that whenever they scratch the same box, they are guaranteed to get the same fruit. And the argument above shows that if you try to solve this by assuming the fruits were predetermined when the two cards were printed at a common location, before they were sent on their separate ways towards Alice and Bob, then you can't reproduce the fact that if they choose different boxes, the chance they'll get the same fruit would be 1/4. 

I don't know any physics, but I've heard that a source of some anxiety among physicists is the possibility that the physical laws which obtain in our universe are just a kind of local accident, and that the constants of nature may vary outside of our Hubble volume. This hypothesis is offered as an explanation for fine tuning, for instance, and it has been given even more credibility (I'm told) by recent findings at the LHC. This possibility has always seemed to me like a pretty good argument for math as a career path. I do worry that I am being too glib, however, and I hope any onlooking physicists will correct me. 

I believe Poincare is referring to the notion of isomorphism. Many mathematical statements are qualified by the phrase "up to isomorphism," so that the statements apply not just to one object, but to an "isomorphism class" of "equivalent" objects. Roughly, an isomorphism is a bijection between two sets which preserves all the relevant structure one has associated with the sets. Put another way, an isomorphism tracks the relations between the elements of the two sets, and shows them to be the same under the identifications of the bijection. More abstractly, there is a category theoretic definition of isomorphism which avoids talk of sets, elements, and bijections. 

Suppose we have two propositions p and q, and an implication of this form: p → □q I can think of two potential interpretations of the meaning of this in terms of possible worlds: 

Bell's theorem shows that certain quantum results are incompatible with both local realist models where the results are predetermined, and local realist models where the particle doesn't "decide" what result to give until the experimenter measures it. Here's a simple analogy I wrote up a while ago to illustrate: 

If p is true in this world, q must be true in all possible worlds. In any world where p is true, it necessarily follows q is true in that possible world as well. But this should not be taken to rule out that there may be worlds where neither is true. For example, it is necessarily true that if Steve is a bachelor than Steve does not have a living spouse, but there can still be worlds where Steve is not a bachelor and does have a living spouse. 

The first thing that comes to mind is that having a duplicate marks the character(s) as disposable. Once a character is disposable he's more pliable as a comic prop. It might also be particularly effective in Hamlet because we perceive doubles not to have thoughts of their own, while Hamlet is one of the first turns in drama and fiction toward interiority and attention to the thoughts of individuals-- in this case the excessively insular, solipsistic, brooding, lonely thoughts of the main character. Our unconscious prejudice may be that having thoughts of one's own is no stronger than having thoughts full stop. So splitting a character into indistinguishable clones is a way of stripping him of subjectivity and throwing into relief the psychological trial of the hero. Btw, do you know the Tom Stoppard play? It's possible that its literally a dramatic exploration of exactly your question. 

"The condition necessary for the act of recollection, is the identity of the being who remembers, with that being whose former states are recalled by memory. To remember experiences of another would be to remember having been somebody else: in other words, to simultaneously affirm and deny one's own identity, a pure and absurd contradiction" (Amédée de Margerie, cited by Michael Maher in "Psychology") Hey everyone, thank you all for your answers and I'm sorry for not answering directly each and every one of you. I think I may have come across the beggining of an "argument" for the sameness of the subject that remembers some event and the subject that experienced that event. Let's start with a principle that says that to feel or sense what Jack feels or senses, you have to be Jack. Well, when you remember some event, you remember the sensations felt by the subject of that first person experience. So, you seem to remember being someone else. But I don't really know how to develop the argument from here. Any thoughts? 

Which of these, if either, is the generally accepted meaning? If anyone can point to a reference by a professional that spells this out that'd be ideal, but if not I'll accept an answer based on personal expertise if there seems to be agreement among those answering. 

Ultimately the symbols for various "logical operators" like the implication symbol -> or the "and" symbol ^ are just defined by their truth tables, so you shouldn't place too much weight on the ordinary-language meaning of "implication" or any other name given to a logical operator. However, one way of thinking about it is that "P implies Q" is logically equivalent to "(P and Q) or (not-P)", which is at least somewhat intuitive--either P is true and therefore Q is true as well, or P is false so it doesn't matter if Q is true or false. And thinking a little more about mathematician's motivation in calling this "implies", suppose we wanted an alternate logical operator, let's call it "alt-implies", such that "P alt-implies Q" would be false if both P and Q were false individually, but the same as the standard implication operator for the other entries on the truth table. Thinking about logically equivalent ways to describe this, it would be equivalent to the rule "when evaluating the proposition 'P alt-implies Q', simply ignore P and define the proposition to be true if Q is true, false if Q is false." This is why what I called the "alt-implies" operator is just called the "q" operator on the chart of all possible binary logical operators here. And you would still need some name for the operator that mathematicians currently label "implies", so since what I called "alt-implies" above is most easily understandable as just a "q" operator (and calling it that makes the it symmetrical with the similar 'p' operator whose truth value is just identical to P), it seems reasonable to use the word "implies" for the operator which has the value "true" when both P and Q are false but otherwise has the same truth-value as Q.
