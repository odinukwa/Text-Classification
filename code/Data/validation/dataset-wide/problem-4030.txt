To me it seems possible, to successfully look at symmetric TSP instances from a geometry-point of view. Examples are: 

I am looking for a description of the linear time algorithm for the TSP in Halin graphs, that was given in 

As the envelope is made of paper, a mathematical model of its deformation would be an isometric coordinate transformation and thus must have zero Gauss curvature almost everywhere; that restriction is clearly violated by the cited solution of the teabag problem. I already pointed out in a comment, that there was an article in the German issue (Spektrum der Wissenschaft, June 1995) of Scientific American, where the topic has been discussed here (in German). Maybe the same topic has also been treated a few month earlier in Scientific American. The essential ressource is Edouard Baumann, especially this link (unfortunately in German only); there is also an image of such a polyhedral cushion. 

As far as I know, $e$ was encountered the first time as the answer to the question, what would happen, if the intervals, in which interest is paid and reinvested, tend to zero or, for short: $$ e := \lim_{n\to+\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$$ The geometric interpretation is straight forward: 

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (cf e.g. $URL$ plays a role in knowledge representation and extraction. 

To my knowledge, Fermat primes, i.e. primes of the form $2^{2^n}+1$ were the first to play a role in a mathematical result, namely in the characterization of constructible regular n-gons. Gauss discovered the constructability of the regular Heptadecagon ($URL$ in 1796. Not much later, in 1805, Sophie Germain proved Fermat's conjecture for primes $p$ for which $2p+1$ is also prime. My Question is: Have there been any mathematical results, that are not related to the properties of prime numbers and, were found prior to Gauss' discovery of the constructability of the regular Heptadecagon, that were formulated via a proper subset of the prime numbers, that was characterized via a parameterized expression. 

(Alternatives might be to either ask the MO community for counter examples or, to boldly publish on ArxiV and awaiting the reaction of readers; but it seems to me that neither of these two alternatives is a nice way of getting a review.) 

Is there an agreed way of expressing undirected integration in formulas? my idea of doing so would be to use the absolute value of the differential $$\int_a^b f(x)|dx| = \int_b^a f(x)|dx|$$ but I would like to get some feedback before actually using it. A typical situation, in which undirected integrals are required, is integrating force along a path. 

Gauss has proven in his famous Theorema Egregium, that it is possible, to calculate the gaussian curvature from measuring angles and distances on the surface, irrespective of how the surface is embedded into space. 

That method would also yield the area of arbitrary set theoretic combinations of arbitrary finite collections of compact regions of euclidean n-space. 

Suppose an optimal tour through a set $P=\lbrace p_1, ...,\ p_n\rbrace$ of $n$ points is known and also an optimal tour through $Q:=P\cup p_{n+1}$. Let $T_{opt}\left(P\right)$ denote the set of edges constituting to the optimal tour through $P$ (and analogous $T_{opt}\left(Q\right)$ for the optimal tour through $Q$), 

What happens, if a rubber band ( of length $l_0$ that has been stretched to length $l_1:=l_0+\Delta l\;$ and brought into the shape of a closed curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ ) is released and if the only force at work is due to the elongation and obeys Hooke's law? Clarification in response to Andreas' comment: The force due to stretching shall be the same in each point of the rubberband. Clarification in response to Hansen's comments: for the mathematical discussion of the problem, it shall be assumed that $l_0=0$, so that the contraction doesn't stop as long as the rubber band has positive length. Furthermore, I would like the mathematical question to be discussed on basis of points and vectors of $\mathbb{R}^3$; physical phenomena like moment of inertia, or bending energy, etc., shall not play a role in this context. I acknowledge however, that trying to model real-world rubber bands is also an interesting question to be tackled, after the questions related to the (over-)simplified model have been solved. By "what happens", I mean 

Then the images of every pair of vertex-disjoint paths connecting $a$ with $c$ and $b$ with $d$ contain at least one pair of edges $e_{ij}\in path\left(a,c\right)$, $e_{hk} \in path\left(b,d\right)$, whose images $e_{ij}'$ and $e_{hk}'$ intersect in a point, that is an inner point of at least one of the images but is an element of both closed line segments. 

This question could be seen as a coordinate-free variant of Sylvester's Four Point Problem (cf e.g. $URL$ Suppose one are given an inifinitely thin stick of unit length, which fraction of the planar quadrilaterals you can generate by cutting the stick into six pieces (for the sides and diagonals) has a convex hull with four corners, when embedded into the euclidean plane? In that setting, it is the number of non-similar quadrilaterals that counts, which means, that the same partitioning of the stick may yield several non-similar quadrilaterals, which are counted separately. 

Addendum 2018-02-11: to indicate, that geometric concepts may indeed be promising, consider the problem of deciding, whether a point $p\notin \mathcal{T_i}$ is closer (in the sense of incurred elongation) to tour edge $(t_i,t_j)$ or to $(t_j,t_k)$. in that special case, where the tour edges are adjacent, the separator equals the radical axis of the circles with center and radius $(t_i,\|t_j-t_i\|)$ and $(t_k,\|t_k-t_j\|)$; whether that is an actual improvement, depends of course on the computational model and the limitations on available resources - for very large instances it may not be viable to store all distances between pairs of points, whence deciding on which side of the radical line a point lies, is cheaper than calculating and comparing two detours. for non-adjacent tour edges the situation is not so simple and yields non-linear algebraic curves as separators in general. 

While checking an idea about knot-placement for spline interpolation, I needed to find a way to calculate splines, that are strictly monotone between adjacent pairs of knots and for which every knot is a local minimum or maximum; I called those splines "vibrant" (another option would have been to call them "bang bang") splines. As it turned out, those kind of splines are especially easy to calculate in the cubic case: "simply" join adjacent pairs of knots with the portion between the two extrema of appropriate cubic polynomials and, fix the value of the second derivative at the knots to the same value (e.g. to $1$); those conditions are sufficient to calculate the spline between two knots independent from the other knots. Question: have those vibrant splines already been encountered or investigated? 

why not speak of the compact or open polygon(al region) when refering to the region defined by the edges and, speak of the boundary if the set of edges is meant? Or one could clarify, whether a "polygon" shall be topologically equivalent to a circle or to a disk (either closed or open). 

It is well known, that the optimal tours are invariant under the addition of vertex weights; it is also known, that minimum spanning trees provide an upper bound on the length of the shortest Hamilton cycle in a graph and, that the MST is sensitive to the addition/subtraction of vertex weights, which makes it possible to penalize vertices with high degree in the MST and thus improve the upper bound in some cases. 

I am looking for a solution of the No Three-in-a-Line problem for the whole $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ plane and had the idea, to use a non-redundant enumeration of the rationals, like the breadth-first enumeration of the knots in the Stern-Brocot tree or the Calkin-Wilf tree. 

The problem can be reduced to an ordinary shortest path problem via vertex splitting where however, the number of generated vertices equals the degree of the original vertex and not two, as is commonly the case in the solution of certain flow problems. The solution steps would be as follows: 

The question is motivated by my quest to generalize planar convex hulls to arbitrary complete graphs. Calculating the curves could be done with a CAS, but that would not bring about any of its non-trivial properties, which is why I am interested in publications. 

A quite naive method would be to create an image, where each pixel-value equals the "distance" between the corresponding pixels of the source images, i.e. $r(x,y) := \vert p(x,y)-q(x,y)\vert$ and check the size of the compressed "difference image". The smaller the size of the compressed difference-image, the closer are the source images. That approach can however not unveil semantic similarity; but as it is fairly simple to implement, it should be a good start. One could different kinds of compression (e.g. lossy and lossless) and pick the most suitable one. Simply storing the difference image in various image-file formats might already suffice. Edit seeing the medical application of similarity detection, I can imagine that the true underlying use case actually is a classification or, recognition problem. There are other problems, that seem to be of similar nature: 

Are there any Euclidean spaces, in which the maximal vertex degree of MSTs (Minimum Spanning Trees) of a finite set of points and edge weights equal to Euclidean distance, isn't equal to the kissing number? Remark: The fact, that the kissing number is an upper bound on the vertex degree of MSTs of Euclidean spaces can be exploited for reducing the memory footprint for calculating those MSTs; instead of feeding $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ distances into the MST algorithm, it suffices to provide only the $k$ smallest distances for each vertex, where $k$ is the kissing number of the respective Euclidean space. 

The problem is equivalent to asking for all Pythagorean triples with bounds on the hypotenuse and a variant of that problem is treated in the article ENUMERATION OF ALL PRIMITIVE PYTHAGOREAN TRIPLES WITH HYPOTENUSE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO N A simple estimate for the number of primitive Pythagorean triples is due to Lehmer: it is less than $N/2\pi$ Turning to the original problem of enumerating all triples, the following observation helps: $a^2+b^2=c^2 \implies a=2uv, b=v^2-u^2, c=u^2+v^2; u\le v$ which leads to the problem of finding $\frac{1}{8}\sum_{i=1}^{n}r(i)$, where $r(i)$ is the number of ways to write $i$ as the sum of two squares of signed integers (cf e.g. wolfram ). The answer is then the aforementioned sum $\frac{1}{8}\sum_{i=1}^{n}r(i)$ 

Remark: In the encoding of the sets uniqueness of the elements is not required; especially if non-uniqueness allows more compact overall encoding of the sets. 

this should be seen rather as a comment: Coordinate geometry seems to have been a singular discovery of Rene Descartes, which he attributed to dream; it is therefore likely, that his choice of axis orientations has been copied ever since. Now for the specific choice of the axis directions the writing direction seems to have played the essential role; the sequence of natural numbers is written from left to right in Europe and thus it would a natural choice (at least in Europe) for the direction of the positive x-axis. For the choice of the y-axis direction the writing direction (top to bottom) apparently wasn't the key motivation; I suspect, that it was chosen due to perceiving geometric images in texts as embedded "paintings" and, due to to the fact, that in perspectivic drawings of ground floors, the more distant points are "above" the closer ones. There are however deviations from that "natural" order: The ciphers of natural numbers run somehow (from the European perspective) in the "wrong" direction, namely from right to left in order of significance, probably due to the Arabic writing direction. The y-axis is often oriented from top to bottom in device coordinates of computer graphics or in sequence of the rows of tables or matrices. Edit: There is an actual example of a coordinate system in use with 4 axes, directed up, to the right, down and, to the left; all coordinates being positive and used in nautics for communicating directions and relative positions. 

It just occured to me that the question can be answered in the affirmative way for the following reasons: 

I am currently trying to find a way to define some notion of "roundness" for subtours in graphs and that definition should only be based on the comparing (sums of) edge length and on the order in which vertices are encountered along (closed) paths; this is however not my question. One idea was to investigate the unimodality of the radius function of circles in polar coordinates in the special case that the origin is on the circle. The next thing to do was to check, how flat an unimodal ellipse could be; the outcome was, that exactly the ellipses with $\frac{a}{b} \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ \wedge\ a\le b$ are the unimodal ones (when $a$ and $b$ are the minor, resp. major ellipse-radius). 

Is there an algorithm for reporting all empty ellipses, that are locked by a finite set $\mathcal{P}$ of points in the euclidean plane? 

What can be concluded from the fact, that $f: X\ni x\mapsto f(x)\in [a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}\setminus\lbrace{-\infty,+\infty\rbrace} $ has the following property: $$ f(x_0) = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \essSup\left(f\left(x\in X\cap U_\epsilon\left(x_0\right)\right)\right)$$ 

Background of my question is, that I would like to store flags indicating the relation between a pairs of non-adjacent edges of a graph (that relation could for example be, whether the edges cross, i.e. whether the pair of edges constitutes to a maximal matching of the sub-graph induced by the four adjacent vertices). My idea is to first calculate the ordinal number $o(\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\})$ corresponding to the set of the integer-labels of the adjacent vertices and from that calculate the the ordinal number of the pair of edges: $$o(\{\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_3,v_4\}\}) := 3\times o(\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}))$$ $$o(\{\{v_1,v_3\},\{v_2,v_4\}\}) := 3\times o(\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}))+1$$ $$o(\{\{v_1,v_4\},\{v_2,v_3\}\}) := 3\times o(\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}))+2$$ Questions: 

I have a problem, that requires sorting a set of simplices, that are defined via their sidelengths, according to volume; the value of the individual volumes isn't relevant in my problem. 

I am looking for theorems about the $NP=P$ problem that made, resp. make, use of (then) novel ideas of TSP heristics or, were motivated by such ideas. I kindly would ask to abstain from expressing opinions about subject; the importance of research on better heuristics is unquestionable to me! 

Let $\lbrace p_1,\ \dots,\ p_n\rbrace$ be a set of points in the Euclidean plane and let $T_0 :=\left(p_1,\ \dots,\ p_n,p_1\right)$ be a Hamilton cycle through the set of points. 

Question are there further applications for non-bipartite matching, especially newer, examples of different areas of applicability? 

Question: does the following mean value have a name? $$v^*=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_iv_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i}}, \alpha_i\in\mathbb{R}^+$$ where the $v_i$ are individual speed limits and the $\alpha_i$ are the cumulated lengths along a route, for which the individual speed limits hold. the mean value $v^*$ reflects the speed that would incur the same energy consumption if the whole route were traveled with that speed. The mean is almost the euclidean norm and it should have been encountered before.
