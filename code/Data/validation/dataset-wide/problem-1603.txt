Summary There is no historical evidence that this ever happened, however it is a true Chinese anecdote on the game. 

In other words, the article is confusing quantum entanglement ("spooky action at a distance", without communication of information), with quantum computing, which would allow us to calculate stuff really fast, but... not faster than light, which is meaningless.

My personal take on the article is that defrosting once a year in winter is a good thing, but that the claimed efficiency losses are dubious. 

Is it possible that he was right? Is there any strong evidence that not all has been said of this tragic death in the jury verdict? Are the official conclusions supported by enough evidence, or are they mere speculation? 

According to Renault's figures, a Scenic with the dCI 110 engine can do up to 80.7 mpg or 34.3 Km/litre. This would allow a maximum theoretical limit of 34.3Km/litre × 60 litre/tank = 2058 Km/tank. Here's how the figures are calculated: 

This makes it clear why a functioning economy helps on both counts: a functioning economy is only possible if the government does not make economic policy mistakes (first cause), and a functioning economy generates, in all likelihood, a stronger agriculture and food abundance. 

Hunger and Increased passing gas However, correlation is not causation, and in most of these cases being hungry is not identified as the (direct) cause of increased passing gas, but as a common symptom. 

It is debated. I found 3 studies relating to this, in temporal order: Contracept Technol Update. 1993 Oct;14(10):154-6. Researchers find no sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid. 

The basis of thermodynamics were discovered around 1650 and was clearly unrelated to the steam engine which was basically a non-commercially viable curiosity. 

The account is an anonymous account, has only uploaded that video, contains a clear reference to its secret contents but does not mention them. If the uploader was not aware of the contents, then it would be uncanny that their username coincides with the contents. If they were aware, then why not mention in the description? My speculation is because they wanted to play the "discovered by chance" card. 

This is a clearly falsifiable hypothesis: what percentage of mycoprotein eaters has an adverse reaction? 

Melatonin does not work, or does not work very well in general. Clinically it is prescribed only for delayed sleep phase syndrome. A comprehensive review of the available studies1, "Melatonin for Treatment of Sleep Disorders" was made by R. Buscemi et al in 2009. The results are as follows: Effectiveness For people without sleeping disorders The studies are of low-to-moderate quality and evidence clinically insignificant effectiveness with respect to sleep onset time and effectiveness of sleep. 

Are any of these supported by facts? If not, how would our hero save the damsel in distress in real life? 

My personal opinion is that many of these studies tend to be poorly constructed. For example many studies on crime rely on objectionable proxy variables which are then contested by other studies. Is reporting that "one doesn't trust policemen" a reliable indicator of delinquency? Is religious literacy a good proxy for religiousness? This particular article attempts to put together what we know about the subject of atheism, but of course its argument can't be stronger than its sources. 

So in other words there's about a 5-point margin of error on the results, and they may well be imprecise due to lying. In other words, the results are way less precise than presented. It is assumed that there will be errors, but that the picture is substantially correct. I find no fault in the overall picture, but of course the exact numbers are probably different from what was presented. In any case, what counts is the qualitative answer: most US residents are creationists. Quantitatively we can say it's the largest subset, although the number is only known to be between 41 and 51 percent of the population (within a 2σ — 95% — confidence interval) Furthermore, the results are slightly different from what is presented on the main site, from the same pdf as above:

source: Muslimnews International, Volume 5 First of all, the quote seems to be a paraphrase. We know this because we can see different versions of it. Secondly there are different sources, yet of course this proves only that people have believed he did say that as early as 50 years ago. On the other hand, we know from DJ Clayworth's answer that no statement of this kind, containing the word "book" is recorded in the annals of the House of Common from his period, which means that either what he said was still a bit different, that it was not recorded correctly (as it's very possible in this case) or that he simply did not say it. We don't have definitive proof so far. This is a poor attempt at an argument from authority. He was also a convinced slave owner, who opposed the abolition of slavery: should we support slavery because he did? 

Photo by Yvonne M. Tso The most pungent bits are in the placental tissue, i.e. around the seeds, and the pith. The seeds themselves have a low content of capsaicin, but the advice of removing pith and seeds is quite sound, because it also implies removing the placental tissue. 

-- Lightning on TV Clearly if unplugging a TV set doesn't make a difference, then tying a knot won't either. Diverting energy to ground is the most important form of protection and this is obtained by grounding your equipment and your house properly, and installing a lightning rod. Can we create an effective minor surge protector by tying knots in a cable? The answer is that it probably won't work -- again, commercial surge protectors work by sending the extra current to the ground instead than your TV. Knotting a cable does not connect it to the ground. Spark Gaps They work by having a gap of air between line and ground. When a voltage goes over a specific level, the gap is filled with a spark which sends energy to the ground, short circuiting. Some versions can be directly connected to ground. Gas Tubes Another kind of spark gaps, but filled with a specific gas for better performance. MOVs

Not in virtue of their chemical composition, possibly only if they specifically contain an insect repellent a particular The CDC has a FAQ regarding insect repellents. In particular it states that: 

Absolutely not. You can safely assume that an intelligence agency has access to your online mail box, including drafts. For example, this is a leaked NSA document claiming that 500,000 online inboxes are snooped on every day. Snowden again makes fun, in front of a community of peers, of using an online platform for espionage purposes: 

So, this study finds that the answer is that above 192Kbit/s, further gains depend on the genre and the training of the listener. Furthermore another study finds that perceived quality depends on whether you are using headphones or not:

Yes. You can see a video from the white house on YouTube where he makes the first statement and the second statement. He is clearly not referring to censorship but to something similar to the Web Of Trust. The third statement is unrelated and refers to cyberwarfare. Here's the third statement which continues with 

—Aric Sigman website More in general, even his claims on his websited have been heavily criticised by Dr. Ben Goldacre on his blog, where he provides three counter-example studies: 

It's true within 50% error for mammals and the study that started this idea is the following: Rest heart rate and life expectancy 

This Wikipedia page contains all you ever wanted to know on the controversy and has 99 citations, a lot of which are to peer-reviewed material and meta-studies. $URL$ In particular, the section "Clinical Trials", says clearly that the safety of silver fillings is disputed: 

Finally, this site (which I am not confident of, but looks legit), clearly states that foam mattresses are at least irritant. 

From the table above it is clear that, once we consider the 5 point uncertainty, nothing new has emerged from the poll: the fluctuations of the values across the years are consistent with the predicted errors. Finally, there's a big manipulation here: the significant question is whether man evolved or not, not whether God assisted! Believing that God influences the world has nothing to do with either the scientific position of evolution and the charlatanerie of creationism. If one discards that false dilemma, then the numbers look much more sane and believable: 47% of Americans accept evolution, and 46% believe in the superstition of creationism. It's still a frighteningly high percentage though. TL;DR The polls don't account directly for people being dishonest. However, that's not the big problem. The real sham is the misrepresentation of the results via omitting the error bars and introducing a false dilemma to make the position of evolution look much, much lower than it is. 

Then again, the definition of warm is quite subjective. I assume, of course, that you didn't mean that the tea would be kept warm indefinitely! That's not what is being claimed, clearly.

The RIAA and the IFPI, which is the world wide recording industry association, do not claim a dollar for a dollar losses directly due to piracy. This it what the IFPI claims: 

The article is partially correct. According to WebMD there are 9 conditions associated with hunger and increased passing gas. 

It's a bit of a stretch. FEMA describes most of that advice as a last resort: if you feel a tingle, and you are in the open, then assume that position, meant to minimize damage. On the other hand, FEMA and all other sources that I've seen clearly spell out that you need to find shelter, and that's the best way to ensure your safety. 

Favourable mutations will take a large number of generations to propagate across the entire population, and unfavourable mutations will also. This is because the favourable mutation happens rarely, but being favourable, it grows exponentially over time until it saturates the gene pool or becomes less favourable. Conclusion Mutations keep on happening as they are intrinsic in the process of reproduction. The gene pool "evolves" by allowing variety in the directions not suppressed by natural selection, and enforcing uniformity in the directions where natural selection is active. In either case, evolution is at work. See a very good article here for more info.

No idea where that article came from but it's from 1947, where the effects of smoking were less studied. In any case, smoking addiction is due to both a psychological and a physiological factor. The physiological part is nicotine addiction: 

The measurements of the Parthenon are quite objectively due to phi. As you can notice in the image below, all major measurements are strictly related to the golden ratio. There are many university, or otherwise reputable sites corroborating this: For example. 

It is a classic example of the so called "spill-over", which is actually well studied. The UK government published a paper in which documents specifically the effect of "big science" on technology advancement and growth.

These are the reasons why the license to produce and sell cosmetics was revoked (canceled, not suspended). It is unlikely that any product contained traces of the poison, however the company has apparently been grossly negligent and endangered its customer's babies. 

TL;DR: No, it's not a viable method, it will likely cause damage and will not likely work at all. Here's what the largest data recovery firms say on the matter: datarecovery.com Stamped on pretty much every page of the site: 

However, I question the study's reliability The copy from the official site is a draft published in February 2016, but that does not include any actual data (UPDATE: the data is after the list of citation at the end of the PDF). It looks like a pre-print, and it is not published in a major journal or peer-reviewed, as far as I can tell. Furthermore, it seems to me the model they are using to fit the data and deduct causation is obviously lacking. Here is what they use: 

The always fascinating Daily Mail came out with a rather surprising article where it claims a Canadian experiment, or review, concluded that people with less-than-average childhood intelligence tend to vote right-wing, and furthermore that this is a causal relationship 

—source — the study includes speed bumps specifically According to wikipedia there is one retracted statement by a London ambulance driver that speed bumps may affect the effectiveness of emergency services—I cannot verify that source because the link is dead—however, skeptically speaking this is a no-brainer. Suggesting that it is better to have more injuries and the emergency services arrive faster is... not smart. Speed kills, speed bumps save lives 

The book cited makes a similar, but not as-strong, claim based on a scientific article which does not support it Both articles cite a book by Trevor Blake, Three Simple Steps: A Map to Success in Business and Life. I've looked up the chapter in question and here is what it says: 

Note that this second biography seems much less reliable as it contains "shock claims" in its sleeve ("This controversial account of Albert Einstein's scandalous personal life challenges the image of this genius, painting a shocking portrait that exposes him as "an adulterous, egomaniacal misogynist who may have even beaten his first wife""). 

It is considered impossible to transmit information faster than light. It has been never achieved in an experiment and the scientific consensus it is that it's impossible. A good breakdown of the arguments is here. In short, faster-than-light travel of information is equivalent to time travel, which is ripe with paradoxes. More information on wikipedia
