I'd also like to know what the sources for that claim are (since you're the one who has seen them.). It does pass the smell test. Manichaeism was on the decline after about 840, but there were still adherents that we know of in China as late as the 14th century, and it was known to have had adherents among Turkish-speakers, and also in other peoples in central Asia during its heyday. The Pechenegs likely moved west from Central Asia sometime between 790 and 850. So it is certainly possible many of them were Manichaeist, and perhaps even likely at least a few of them were. Alex is right that there are any number of possibilities other than that though. Another likely religion would have been Tengrism. That appears to have been the dominant religion of their fellow Western Turks, the Khasars and the Hungarians*, at that time. As the original religion of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples, this would be my first guess for the religion of any nomadic Turkish groups of that period, in the absence of any historical references saying otherwise. * - Hungarians are lingusticly and geneticly not at all Turkish, but oddly their culture at the time was otherwise almost entirely Turkish. 

If you compare this with the previous map, you will see that San Marino is somewhere in the border area between the brown (P-S) and the Red (Papal State). The P-S forces marched down the Adriatic coast (probably right by San Marino), defeating the Pope at Castelfidarfdo on the way, to meet up with Garibaldi's forces in Naples. So here's what it looked like it 1861: 

I see no evidence whatsoever put forth in the above text supporting the assertion that human women were socially equal or superior prior to the agricultural revolution. Such evidence should not be hard to come by, simply by talking with an anthropologist or two. There are plenty of hunter-gatherer societies left in the world, not to mention halfway decent records of past ones encountered by literate societies. I believe most have been found to be quite paternalistic. For instance, in Sioxan languages, the native words used for the head(s) of the tribe usually translates to something like "little old men" or "old man chief". This implies a societal requirement for leadership of being male. While related to Bonobos, recent genetic studies have shown that humans are slightly more closely related to Chimpanzees (and Chimps and Bonobos are closer to each other than either are to humans). Chimpanzees it turns out have a much more paternalistic society. Unlike bonobos, Chimps tend to look to settle disputes with violence. They engage in activities like hunting and warfare, both almost exclusively by males. The males also aggressively try to control sexual access to females. 

It probably will surprise few people to see me say that rather a lot of the US history taught to US students in grade school is false. However, what may come as a surprise to some here is that the story about The Great Compromise being a battle between small states and large states may actually be one of those things. However, this isn't hard at all to check on. Due to all the letters delegates sent home during deliberations, there's plenty of information on all the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. Max Farrand was even nice enough to compile a lot of it into one document for us. Here's how founding father James Madison described the debate, according to The Records: 

First off, what is today the state of Oklahoma is the result of three "leftover" pieces of territory. The eastern part of the state was reserved for the "Civilized" (aka farming) tribes pushed out of the American Southeast. The western half was later divied up to other tribes (eg: the Osages) as they got pushed out of their territories. Generally they weren't force-marched into their territories by the army though, so the tribal element in the western reservations wasn't nearly as strong as in the east. The "panhandle" was part of Texas, but was too far North to fit in the slave state/free state compromise that allowed Texas to join the Union, and too far south to fit in a similar compromise that brought in Kansas. As for the Indian Territory (eastern half of Oklahoma) itself, it was originally supposed to be land set aside for the tribe's use. Each tribe had its own specific territory which it was supposed to govern. The problem was white folk didn't tend to respect tribal governments, so effectively the Indian areas became lawless areas; a haven for outlaws and squatters. Eventually the USA government stepped in, made it a proper territory, and forced all the tribes to divvy up their reservations to their indivdual members. (As a result of this, Oklahoma technically has no "reservations", unlike a lot of states with significant Native American presence). Excess land at this point (aka: Unassigned Lands) was opened up to white settlement. Also, many of the individual tribe members didn't live very close to their assigned plots, weren't very well-versed in USA property law, and thus were easy prey for white speculators. So by the beginning of the 20'th century tribe members actually didn't own much land in "Indian Territory" at all. Another thing to realize here is that traditional tribal culture viewed tribal and clan affiliation as voluntary, rather than hereditary. In other words, they didn't have the USA/European culture's obsession with "race" or "blood". People would move between tribes at will, and tribes and clans had little compunction about adopting white (or black) people who were serious about joining the tribe. Indeed many of the tribal leaders on the Trail of Tears were by our reckoning mostly White. For example, Cherokee Cheif John Ross was 1/8th Cherokee and 7/8ths Scots, and his first language was English. So when looked at with our modern White/Red/Black blinders on, who went where becomes very confusing. So yes, there were certianly many "white" (and "black") Americans living in Indian Territory. 

The way that was phrased should be ringing bells right off the bat. The USA has a long and proud history of having tall tales (iow: outrageous lies) made up about opposing politicians. As a man who split and refounded the Democratic Party, and the first President from a "western" state, Andrew Jackson had more than the typical share of political opponents. Here's how James Parton himself put it in his forward to his Jackson biography: 

I was singing the hymn Oh God Our Hope in Ages Past today in Church, and noticed something interesting. The fifth verse reads as follows: 

James Madison apparently was particularly supportive of direct popular election, but realized that Southern states would be faced with a choice of having much less voice that way, or giving their slaves actual votes, neither of which they would ever agree to. So he eventually (on July 20th) came out in support of the Electoral College as a way to give the states weighted voices in the Presidential decision, on the basis that had already been negotiated for Congress (specifically the 3/5ths compromise). 

Here's a video of MLK on NBC's Meet the Press in 1965 receiving this exact same treatment from a panel of white journalists two years later. All these criticisms will sound quite fresh, if you follow the discussions around current American social justice movements. Surprisingly little seems to have changed in that regard. 

(emphasis mine). Spain of course was a neutral country at the time. So what incident involving Barcelona is he referring to here? 

One large reason was Pope Paul III. He issued a bull in 1537 stating that American Indians had souls, and forbidding enslaving them except under some very specific circumstances. However, this wouldn't have affected the Protestant colonists, and Catholic ones weren't always very scrupulous about this either. Another issue was that Indians acquired a reputation of being difficult to enslave. Writings from that time seem to justify this in terms of their own relative racial qualities, but I suspect the fact that they wouldn't have to swim an ocean to get back to their own culture after an escape probably had a lot to do with their attitude. Even today modern "white slavers" try to move their victims as far as possible from their homes as quickly as possible. 

In other words, it appears to have been a far more popular word in the early to mid 20th century (precisely when Adlai Stevenson was active) than in the mid to late 18th (when Jefferson was active). So I'd go with Adlai. If you're wrong, at least you can blame a former VP for it, rather than a bunch of random internet people you don't know. 

The best candidate for protagonist in this story is probably William Murdoch, an employee of Boulton and Watt's who had an interest in using Watt's steam engine concepts for locomotion. What is well-documented is that in 1784 he built a working model in his living room (yes, household model trains are older than real trains!), and then probably another larger one that he nearly patented. Sadly not much else is known, and there are all sorts of wonderful apocryphal stories floating around about what he did next. The next best candidate would be Richard Trevithick. He moved next door to Mr. Murdoch, and soon took up the mantle. He created the first documented full-scale operating passenger steam carriage in 1801, and carried 6 (not 12) passengers. Interestingly, the best documentation I could find for this is actually a folk song. Obviously not the most reliable of references, but it does mention a female passenger wearing white stockings (so probably not a prisoner). 

The causus belli of the First Gulf War was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. President George (HW) Bush managed to get a series of UN declarations calling for the Iraqi troops to leave, and authorizing succesively more drastic actions to achieve this, culminating in 678, which authorized "all nessecary means". This provided a certian amount of international cover for military action, but only towards restoring Kuwait, not toppling Iraq itself. Also, many Muslim states signed on to the effort as allies, with the understanding that the recovery of Kuwaiti independence was the only goal. Most significantly, Saudi Arabia provided the required miltary basing and staging territory, with the understanding that the scope of the effort was limited to restoring Kuwait. There is debate about whether the US administration would have liked to see Saddam toppled as well. Colin Powell claims in his memoirs that the intention was always to leave him in place, as a bulwark against Iran. However, various public statements made by President Bush led many people inside Iraq to (incorrectly) believe the US would support popular uprisings, with very unfortunate results. The administration of his son (GW Bush), certianly believed this was a mistake. As to Iraqi failures, frankly they lost the war the instant it started. Their mid-20th Century vintage Soviet and Chinese military hardware was simply no match for modern top of the line US and NATO equipment. They could have been tactical geniuses throughout the conflict, and still gotten beaten handily. 

Dorris Kerns Goodwin had a great chapter on the 1860 nomination in her book Team of Rivals. First off, you should realize that party nominations in that era were decided by party delegates at their convention, not by the general public. These delegates in turn were generally either appointed by local elected officials, or were themselves elected officials (sort of like modern "superdelagates") So what effect any published speech may have had amongst the general public was simply not a consideration. Or at least not a direct one. What got Lincoln the nomination on the party convention floor was simply that he was a better politician than his rivals. At the time, these were William H. Seward of New York, Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, and Edward Bates of Missouri. He outmaneuvered them all. The important thing about the Cooper Union address was that Lincoln was being portrayed by his rivals for the nomination as a backwoods simpleton. Many of them actually may have believed this. The address showed he had the mental wherewithal to be a viable option. New York was mostly Seward territory of course, but in a multi-candidate nomination with a lot of strong personalities (who likely all come with enemies as well as allies), it often pays to be everyone's second choice.
