As you may notice already there is no relationship between tables and won't be on the future. If I run the following queries I will get a lot of rows per table: 

Can any give me some help? EDIT Because has duplicates (a table with no restrictions at all - see image below) I need to clean up a bit the trigger before execute. 

I'm trying to get non equal or repeat results from default_tb_persona using a JOIN sentence, this is what I've made for that: 

So, I have this relations on my tables (see image) and I need to understand some things. I'll enumerate what I understand and what I need from yours is to say if I'm right or not and in case I'm not give me the good answer. If is FK on and tables if I set onUpdate and onDelete to what this mean? 1- When I delete a the cascade will delete all the records on and tables? 2- When I delete a what happen with the that points to that person? In order to maintain a good table structure, data consistency and integrity, what are you're suggestions regarding this topic? 

In SQL Server, I have a user in a particular database and I've been asked to grant them access to all of the non-system views of the database only. I believe this can be done by editing securables of type view and granting select on each one, but there are many, many views. Is there a more efficient way to accomplish this? 

I'm creating a linked server from ServerA to ServerB, both of them are SQL Server 2008 servers. I need to create the linked server using a domain service account so that anyone will be able to utilize the linked server. ServerB only accepts Windows authentication, so I've added the service domain account to ServerB with proper permissions. I've verified the permissions by logging in with the service domain account to ServerB and everything looks great. But when I create a linked server on ServerA with the script below, I get a "login failed for user". Is this script incorrect, or am I missing something else? 

I actually found a resolution to this. When setting up the linked server to Server B, I used a Windows authenticated account as the remote login (although MSDN says it must be a SQL Server authenticated login) and I was able to successfully connect to linked server B, while connected to server A from a local workstation, while NTLM was set as the authentication mode. 

Can I pass an array as value or I need to iterate for the values and execute the query several times? 

But it's taking an eternity because the large size of the resultsets. I've tried to separate in two queries and then JOIN them but is the same takes to much time: 

But if I want to find "how many times the user using the player Lizard has won, lost and draw" then I need to run the following queries: 

Now, regarding performance, disk space savings, query savings and so on, how would you do that? What is your recommendation on this edge case? Note: for the moment I am using MariaDB 10.1.x but this will be in a MySQL instance, probably 5.x or so I am not sure at all since I didn't got those details yet 

Following Neil and user16484 suggestions also ypercube and jynus and good practices at DB modeling, I come with this model 

Take a look at the column which is a right now but it will hold a phone number. Since I don't know how many numbers a phone could have all over the world then I am trying to cover almost all of them. I want to keep database integrity as much as possible so I think is not a proper type for hold this kind of information - maybe I am wrong, you tell me - so I am thinking in change to or even . When I am defining a column in Workbench I should specify the number between parentheses not in all the cases but in those I mention previous I had to. So if I do this: I got this error: 

Both multiple files in a filegroup and multiple filegroups are tools for managing your database. The first lets you manage your IO and both will let you manage your backups. It is possible to backup a single file of a database as well as a single filegroup. Be sure to backup the tail of the transaction log when you do if you are planning on restoring it somewhere. Database files allow your multi-core CPUs to have multiple read/write streams to the database without hitting higher disk queuing values. It may help to think of the filegroup as a logical division and the file as a physical division. If you have multiple filegroups you will automatically have multiple files as a file can only belong to one filegroup. It can also help (if you have enough cores on your server) to have multiple files in your filegroups. That can give you the best of both worlds. You assign database objects to a filegroup not a file. You can put the files on different physical disk arrays. When I first started doing database work it was common knowledge that you put your data and log on separate disks. If you had the budget you would put your non-clustered indexes on another disk. It's tough to get that these days with SAN technology everywhere. However, SAN is a management tool not a performance tool. As you pointed out having different filegroups will allow you to isolate high traffic tables from each other and from lower traffic tables. It will also allow you a limited additional protection from a corrupted database potentially limiting data corruption to a smaller part of the data. 

I am trying to get a list of with it's related information from the rest of the tables meaning the and . I have made this query: 

I have a file with a bunch of data which I am using for load all the data into a DB table. The file lacks the ID column (because that's is an internal column managed through our software and they don't care about it). To avoid issues with the data my "solution" was to move the column to a position where doesn't interfere with the data from the file and that's right after column or just at the end. Check the following image for a graphical representation of the table: Currently the is my first column and I haven't any problem but I am trying to move to the end because the issue I am having with the data but I got the following error: 

I have two databases, in first database I have a table called and in the second database I have a table called . The SQL for each is below: 

I was recently tasked with moving some databases to a new server. I created backups then restored the databases to the new server and it looks like the database users were retained, however there's no corresponding logins, prohibiting the users from accessing the new server. All of the users are domain users. Is there any way to iterate over the existing users in a database and create a login for each? 

I'm trying to get a linked server to ServerA created on another server, ServerB using "Be made using the login's current security context" in a domain environment. I read that I'd need to have SPNs created for the service accounts that run SQL Server on each of the servers in order to enable Kerberos. I've done that and both now show the authentication scheme to be Kerberos, however, I'm still facing the error: 

Is there a "best" way to automatically restart SQL Server on a regular basis? I read that I could create a batch file to net start, net stop the agent and service in a batch file and schedule that, but I was curious if there was a better way of doing this. Please nevermind how this is indicative of a larger problem of operation, I've been arguing this for a month and we've ended up here. Thanks :).
