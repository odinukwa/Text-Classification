I found a better diagram illustrating this (the diagram includes two cases: one with the BP flatter than the LM and one steeper; the points and movements marked with an asterik (*) are the ones concerned with the case of BP being steeper than the LM). (Image Courtesy of Polinomics: $URL$ 

Recently in a test I was asked to describe the modified IS-LM framework. I assumed I was being asked the IS-LM-BP model, since it modifies the traditional IS LM model by adding a BP curve. I looked up on a couple of references (Macroeconomics by Dornbusch, and Macroeconomics by Olivier Blanchard) but they have no reference to it. Looking the term up on a search engine only throws results about papers that suggest a modification to the IS LM model. What exactly is a modified IS-LM framework? 

In Chapter 20 of the book Economic Dynamics in Discrete Time, named "Recursive Utility", the author asserts that the Time-Additive Expected Utility Model (TAEU) has some shortcomings when applied to dynamic economic models. He lists them as follows: 

The typical dynamic consumption-saving under certainty model can be written as: $$ \max V(c)=\sum_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{t-1}\; u(c_t) $$ Subject to the intertemporal budget constraint $$ \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{y_t}{1+r}=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{c_t}{1+r} $$ Where $T\leq \infty$ (finite or infinite horizon), $\beta \in (0,1)$ is the subjective discount factor, $y_t$ is the individual's income and $c_t$ is the individual's consumption in every time period. Finally, $u(\cdot)$ is the agent's subutility function, with $u^{\prime}>0$ whose concavity is usually related to the agent's preference for consumption smoothing. The argument is equivalent to the one justifying that an individual will reveal risk aversion iff his utility function over wealth is strictly concave. The argument that leads to consumption smoothing is the following: The first order condition for the problem is the well known Euler equation $$ \frac{u^{\prime}(c_t)}{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}=\beta \; (1+r) $$ It is assumed that $\beta^{-1}=(1+r)$ so that $$ u^{\prime}(c_t)=u^{\prime}(c_{t+1}) \quad \Rightarrow \text{by strict concavity of} \; u \quad c_t=c_{t+1} $$ I have two questions regarding this argument which are somehow related: 

Four-fifths of Algeria is just desert --which leaves no room for agriculture. The Algerian economy is mostly powered just by the oil industry, which contribute about ~70% of government revenues. Oil and oil related products constitute more than 80% of Algeria's exports. For example, Turkey has twice the population of Algeria but it has more than 7.5 times the cattle Algeria has. (14.2 in Turkey vs 1.6 in Algeria). So the short answer is that Algeria isn't just suited for Agriculture. 

Then he introduces Recursive Utility (RU) as a class of preferences developed to overcome these issues. He then proceeds to study the properties of RU, without stopping to study these "shortcomings". I am interested in the following: even though I could try to derive the anomalies myself, is there a article/textbook/survey article that studies formally (by formally I mean in a decision theoretic fashion, i.e studying the axioms and their effect on the representation) the structure of TAEU and show formally the shortcomings mentioned above? The author offers references for textbook and survey treatments of RU, but not the TAEU. Thank you very much for any comment and help! 

This question only considers federal taxes in the United States. Also, by "capital income" I am including dividends, interest, capital gains, corporate incomes and estates. The Chamley-Judd result states that under certain assumptions, capital income should be untaxed to maximize economic efficiency. More recently work has called some of those assumptions into question and suggested that a positive capital income tax is optimal, but I believe that there is more or less of a consensus across economists that from a pure economic efficiently standpoint, capital income taxes should be significantly lower than they currently are. Nevertheless, many economists oppose lowering the capital income tax rate (possibly offset by a uniform increase in the ordinary income rates) on fairness/distributive grounds, as people who earn capital income tend to be wealthier than average, so the capital gains tax is significantly progressive (at least in the short term, when we can neglect changes in economic growth), and so such a change would probably be regressive. Opponents of capital income taxation respond that any decrease in the overall progressivity of the federal tax system brought about by eliminating capital income taxation can simply be compensated for by making the ordinary income tax rates more progressive. While there would certainly be individual winners and losers under such a change (e.g. people who earn significantly more or less of their income from capital than most people at their same income level), in principle the distribution of effective overall federal tax rates across the entire US population could be left completely unchanged by sufficiently precise tweaks to the ordinary income brackets. Such a change would boost the tax code's efficiency while leaving its progressivity unchanged. (I'm assuming that everyone pays their taxes honestly and neglecting any changes in tax evasion that this change might cause.) If all capital income taxation were eliminated in the US, how would the ordinary income tax brackets need to change in order to keep the federal tax system's overall progressivity the same? 

The result of consumption smoothing seems to be independent of the preference for such smoothing: one needs the condition $\beta =(1+r)$ to hold in orther to obtain the result. It seems to me that the implication $$ u^{\prime}(c_t)=u^{\prime}(c_{t+1}) \quad \Rightarrow c_t=c_{t+1} $$ 

$c:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow 2^{X}\backslash \emptyset$ (as in the second link) $c:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow 2^{X}\backslash \{ \emptyset\}$ (as in the first link) 

Would still hold for a strictly convex utility function, as one needs a much general condition to the implication to hold, namely that the derivatives of the utility function will be unique for any increasing utility function.. it seems to be that the uniqueness of $u^{\prime}$ (i.e $u^{\prime}(a)=u^{\prime}(b) \quad \Rightarrow a=b$) will hold irrespective of the sign of $u^{\prime \prime}$ provided it is not equal to zero. If my thinking is correct this would imply that the desire for smoothing doesn't play any role on what the individual does at the end, as this possibility is open only when $\beta =(1+r)$ holds, and furthermore, it would be optimal to smooth out consumption even to an agent with a strictly convex utility function. 

I'm stuck at figuring out the effect of a fiscal expansion in the case of floating exchange rate with the BP curve steeper than the LM curve. My textbook has not mentioned it but I'd like to how it'd turn out. Here's my guess: 

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare answered in the upper house to a question that India has a fertility rate of 2.2 (link here). The replacement fertility level is usually given at 2.1 to 2.2. These sources suggest that India's population is projected to grow at least until 2060 (2050 in some sources): Quartz, The Hindu. The Quartz article even cits UN population projects and says: "Even under the instant-replacement fertility variant, with the country’s fertility assumed to fall immediately to 2.1 births per woman, India’s population would reach 1.9 billion by the century’s close." This source defines the replacement fertility level as: "Replacement level fertility is the level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. In developed countries, replacement level fertility can be taken as requiring an average of 2.1 children per woman." What I don't understand is: how can India's population be projected to grow until 2060 if it has already reached replacement fertility level in 2017? A 'generation' is usually 25 years. Even if we take it as 30 years, India's population should stop growing in a couple of decades. How does the UN project that it'll grow until 2060? 

My question is about the following notation: I have noticed in several places (for example here (page 15) and here (page 1)) that different authors use different notations for choice correspondences. Given a set $X$ of objects that might be chosen and a collection of non-empty subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of the power set of $X$, some use 

More precisely if $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell} : x \geq 0\}$, the production function would be $$ f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n}, \quad n\geq 2 $$ For simplicity we can assume the firm operates in a competitive market so that the price is given. My question is, how does the firm choose the input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}$ as to maximize profits? I did some research and apparently the type of problem this is a “multi-objective” optimization problem, and it appears to be an active field in engineering. Some of the methods to solve this kind of problems use pareto-dominance style arguments. I wanted to know if anyone could clarify the specific question of multi product profit maximization, and more generally I would also appreciate any literature or books on this topic (multi objective optimization), written for economists, as I have been searching in google and every book I find appears to be written for engineers. I suspect that a treatment of this topic from an economics point of view would involve some discussion of social choice theory. Any help is most welcomed! 

Can this one-off cases be extended? For instance, if I employ someone to destroy 50 buildings and rebuild them, does that contribute an increase in GDP? 

GDP = Consumption + Government Expenditure + Investment + Exports - Imports My cases are: (1) If the employee is getting paid for his extra-work, his consumption would increase. (2) This employee might take away the job of someone else --and thus his increase in spending could get nullified By definition, GDP = the total value of all goods and services produced. (1) If even after working overtime, the company produces the same amount of goods / service --by definition, GDP hasn't risen at all. 

All the discussions of the velocity of money that I've come across (e.g. here, here, and here) only display relative changes in the velocity of the money (e.g. by normalizing it by an unspecified value). I've never seen any source report an actual numerical value (with the units of inverse time) for a given point in time, for any choice of money supply. Does anyone have a reference for such a value? 

The fact that the burden of a tax on sellers can by borne by buyers, and vice versa. More generally, the fact that true tax incidence is largely or completely unrelated to who is nominally being taxed (e.g. taxes on yacht purchases can in principle hurt the poor more than the rich, etc.). The fact that in a perfectly competitive market with free entry and exit, all firms make zero profits in the long run (if opportunity costs are taken into account). Coase's theorem: "if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low transaction costs, bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property". (E.g. under a cap-and-trade system for pollution permits with sufficiently low transaction costs, the final allocation of permits is independent of the initial allocation, even if some permits are sold and others are arbitrarily given away for free.) This one's a bit more "in the weeds", but the difficulty of eliminating the marriage penalty: "it is mathematically impossible for a tax system to have all of (a) marginal tax rates that increase with income, (b) joint filing with income splitting for married couples, and (c) combined tax bills that are unaffected by two people's marital status."

IS moves to the right (1 to 2) At B, there is a deficit in BOP, which causes the domestic currency to depreciate. This increases exports and decreases imports, which causes net exports to increase, which then causes Y to increase, which shifts IS further up (IS 3). At B, because of increase in net exports, BOP improve and so BP also shifts to the right. The economy settles at the new equilibrium C.
