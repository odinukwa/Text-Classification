The perception that the Celts were promiscuous seems to be based on, at least in part, ancient writers’ interpretations of marital relationships and / or a superficial knowledge of Celtic customs and culture. On the latter point, Strabo admits to lacking evidence according to David Rankin in Celts and the Classical World, 

SHORT ANSWER NO. The two main databases on the trans-Atlantic slave trade do not support the idea that French slave ships had, on average, higher mortality rates than American carriers. In fact, the opposite may well be true, though this can be explained by American slavers being less experienced than others (British and French slave ships also had high mortality rates when they first started shipping slaves - as they became more experienced, mortality rates declined). DETAILED ANSWER Shocking though the Atlantic slave trade was, the mortality statistics cited in the question may not tally with other sources. The data quoted here comes mostly from the Du Bois Institute dataset (in ‘Transoceanic Mortality: The Slave Trade in Comparative Perspective’ by Herbert S. Klein, Stanley L. Engerman, Robin Haines, and Ralph Shlomowitz) and the Voyages Database (from ‘The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade: A Database’ published by Cambridge University Press). These two sources seem to be the two most comprehensive sets yet compiled. The total number of slaves shipped to the Americas is variously estimated to be 12 million, 12.5 million, and 13.9 million (Edward Dunber, cited in P. Curtin). The three largest flag carriers between 1501 and 1870 were the Portuguese (around 5.8 million embarked), the British (around 3.2 million embarked), and the French (around 1.4 million embarked). Estimates of mortality rates during shipment vary from 12.5% to around 16%. Mortality rates decreased over time from around 21% during the period 1601-1650 to about 6% for the period 1751-1800 (during which time the trade peaked), and then increased during the period 1801 – 1850 to about 13%. The decline was partly due to improved conditions (though probably for economic rather than humanitarian reasons) and faster ships, meaning less time at sea. The increase at the tail end of the slave trade was mostly due to the Portuguese who accounted for over 75% of the trade in this period as Britain (in 1808) and France (in 1815) had outlawed it. These figures do not take account of deaths during the acquisition of slaves as no one has been able to accurately estimate this. As far as mortality rates by flag carrier are concerned, neither set of statistics I’ve found support the idea that rates were significantly higher on French ships. For the period 1501 to 1870, calculations from one source gives rates of 

Yugoslavia was established before WW2 (on 3 October 1929 the Kingdom of SHS was renamed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia), but it is true that after the WW2 the entire regime changed. (During and) after WW2 there was communist republic with president Tito, named Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (1943), renamed to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946. On 25 March 1941 Hitler made Yugoslavian government to sign the Triparte Treaty. That was followed by huge protests throughout the whole country. Senior military officers were also opposed to the treaty and launched a coup d'état when the king returned on 27 March. Army General Dušan Simović seized power, arrested the Vienna delegation, exiled Paul, and ended the regency, giving 17-year-old King Peter full powers. The new government decided to stay in Triparte Treaty, but at the same time they secretly connected with GB for help in military material (GB was encouraged by events from 27 March). This government also tried to connect with Soviet Union (a pact was made to help each other). Hitler then decided to attack Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, followed immediately by an invasion of Greece. The Axis Powers occupied Yugoslavia and split it up. The Independent State of Croatia was established as a Nazi satellite state, ruled by the fascist militia known as the Ustaše that came into existence in 1929, but was relatively limited in its activities until 1941. German troops occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as part of Serbia and Slovenia, while other parts of the country were occupied by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Italy. The government went to exile in London. The Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the communist-led Yugoslav Partisans and the royalist Chetniks, with the former receiving Allied recognition only at the Tehran conference (1943). The heavily pro-Serbian Chetniks were led by Draža Mihajlović, while the pan-Yugoslav oriented Partisans were led by Josip Broz Tito. The Chetniks were initially supported by the exiled royal government and the Allies (before 1943), they but soon focused increasingly on combating the Partisans rather than the occupying Axis forces. From 1941 to June 1944 there was British representative in Chetniks' staff. Axis helped them with material and propaganda system. By the end of the war, the Chetnik movement transformed into a collaborationist Serb nationalist militia completely dependent on Axis supplies. In May 1943 the Partisans army connected with Axis. They got help in food, munition, medicine and so on. The Teheran Conference (1943): The Partisans of Yugoslavia should be supported by supplies and equipment and also by commando operations. There was some role and involvement of GB in Yugoslavia. The involvement was much bigger after the war for borders, mostly about question of Trieste.

F. N. David, in Games, Gods and Gambling, citing Suetonius, mentions that it is unfortunate that the emperor Claudius' book 'How to Win at Dice' has not survived. While Davis does not believe it contained rules on games, it might have told us something. 

One could thus travel even without with the British Visitor's Passport (BVP). One of the documents the above passage is most likely referring to is the British Excursion Document (BED) which was valid for 3 days and which could be used for day trips to France (cost £2.50). This Home Front article in the Daily Telegraph gives different conditions for the BED (perhaps from a different date):

So, yes, the Germans got some US gas, but it was negligible and certainly not with the US's agreement or help. In fact, Britain and the US were more concerned about the Germans getting supplies of tungsten from German - operated mines in Spain.

You can find the answer to that question in Jared Diamond's book Guns, Germs and Steel. He states that people get infected by their pets and that all great epidemics (variola, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, influenza ...) evolved from animals. Microbes needs a mass of people to spread around so big societies, living in cities and connected with good trading roads, were is the best place for them. They can't survive in small societies because they kill anyone who isn't resistant and therefore fails to spread. Those who survive develop antibodies. Microbes can't survive in small communities of farmers and hunters. Because american Indians didn't have antibodies to European diseases so many died - sometimes the whole villages. In this diseases it is also success in Pizarro's and Cortes' success. Some scientist believe that there were 95 % decrease in population in 200 years after Columbus. The only infectious disease coming from America to Europe was syphilis. In America there were great civilizations living in big cities: Aztecs, Incas and Indians who lived in Mississippi. But this cities were never connected with trading paths so microbes couldn't spread as they did in Europe and Asia. The main reason for lack of infectious diseases is that there were no animals, living in herds. There were only five domestic animals: a turkey, a lama, a cavy, some bird and a dog - and they were no source of microbes as cows, sheep. It doesn't mean that there are no infectious diseases, but there are not so many. But epidemics, diseases of masses, can appear only in dense crowd. This started with agriculture 10.000 years ago and increased with building cities. People live close to each other, they also have pets ... If I sum it up: according to Jared Diamond there were no epidemics in Americas before 1492. 

The Assassins attack in 1251 was probably aimed at Mongke Khan. Edwin Black in Banking on Baghdad, citing three other sources, says 

The senate accepted the truth of these claims and Caracalla's successor, Macrinus, was driven from power. The boy became emperor Elagabalus who has gone down in history as one of Rome's most decadent emperors. He was assassinated when he was just 18.

Although one might expect enterprising individuals to set up inns in areas where there was a demand, this does not appear to have always been the case. In early 12th century Norway, King Eystein I (reigned 1103 to 1123) set up a hostel in Dovre because, 

COMPARING THE ENGLISH, DANISH, FRENCH AND LEONESE MONARCHIES Only by reducing the time periods for England and France to match that of Denmark can we make a meaningful comparison between the three monarchies. I've also added Leonese monarchs. (Note: the data for England is taken from the link provided by Luís Henrique) England - Edward the Martyr [b.962] to Edward IV [d. 1483] 48.2 years France - Louis V [b.966] to Louis XI [d.1483] 45.3 years Leon - Ramiro III [b.961] to Henry IV [d.1474] 42.7 years Denmark - Sweyn I [b.960] to Christian I [d.1481] 42.4 years For the adult royal family of Wales and associated Marcher relations (earliest born was 1168, last to die was 1333), Sarah Woodbury has calculated a life expectancy of 48.7 for men and 43.6 for women (but she doesn't say what age she starts with for adults).
