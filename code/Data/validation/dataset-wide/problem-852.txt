The simple answer to your question is, simply, yes. All objects in the inner solar system is generally assumed to have been impacted by the same population of impactors which is mostly comprised of asteroids, and perhaps up to 10% comets. The outer solar system likely has a much larger percentage of cometary impactors. Of the five main inner solar system terrestrial bodies, the Moon and Mercury have the most preserved crater record, idealized by a death of volcanism early in their histories, no atmosphere to speak of, and therefore craters are best preserved there. Mars is second-best (some atmosphere, localized volcanism over the last few billion years, and water in the first ~billion years). Venus is a mess for cratering (entire planet resurfaced ~400-800 million years ago plus a thick atmosphere that prevents craters <3-5 km from forming), while Earth has the most modified crater record. With the moon next door, it is our best historical record for what also likely hit Earth. The factors that will alter the lunar crater population from what would have formed on Earth are primarily gravity, surface type, and atmosphere. Atmosphere will not only screen out the smallest impactors (and hence not make craters), but it will also fragment less competent objects, changing what could have made a single large impact on the moon into something that will more likely make numerous smaller, clustered craters on Earth (from the surviving fragments). A larger surface gravity will tend to decrease the size of the final crater caused by a given impactor, but the dependence is small (difference of around 35% between Earth and the Moon despite the factor of 6 difference in gravity). Surface type is much less well understood in the cratering community. Earth has stronger, denser crust than the Moon, but it's also ~70% covered by water -- the surface of Venus is like being under 1 km of water on Earth, so any ocean >1 km deep is going to prevent craters $\lesssim 3-5$ km from forming. These all combine for the much longer and more complicated answer of, "yes, but it's hard to figure out." There are lots of knobs in the models that we still don't know how to correctly turn, but we can, to first-order, use the lunar crater population and rate to estimate the population of craters that should have formed on Earth. At the time of writing this, there are 184 confirmed terrestrial impact craters, which is certainly a tiny fraction of a percent the number that have formed over Earth's history.

The time the sun is actually directly overhead depends on where you are in your time zone. In the eastern part of the time zone, the sun will be overhead sooner, and in the western part it will be overhead later. Where you are, it happens to be directly overhead at 11:32. 

It does sound natural that a stronger gravity would imply a thicker atmosphere, but no matter how strong the gravity is, there is a point where the atmosphere fades away almost to nothing. At the height of the ISS, earth's gravity is around 80% of the gravity at sea level. But yet the ISS is orbiting in the vacuum of space. Similarly, above Jupiter's atmosphere, the gravity is still more than twice that of earth, but there is still vacuum. With the sun, it just so happens that the part of the atmosphere that produces the light we see is close enough to the (imprecisely defined) edge of space that its density has gone down almost to nothing. Certainly, if it were cooler, it would be denser. But some day the sun will be a white dwarf, about the size of the earth but with not that much less mass than it has now. Its gravity will be hugely strong, but there will still be a top of the atmosphere were it is less than a millionth of earth's atmosphere. As it cools, that atmosphere will cool so that it is no warmer than earth's atmosphere, but there will still be a point where the atmosphere is that thin. And even above that height, gravity will be much higher than even at the current surface of the sun. 

To expand on Florin Andrei's answer, it's not just that the human eye is not a linear sensor, although that is definitely an important part of the reason. The eye itself adjusts to the ambient light level by changing pupil size, which will mask overall changes in brightness. In addition, the eye, like most senses, is primarily a relative sensor. Colors are judged relative to neighboring colors, and brightness is judged relative to neighboring brightness. "Neighboring" applies to time as well as space: a sudden change in brightness from 100,000 lux to 10,000 lux would be quite noticeable, but when it happens over an hour it is imperceptible. The final change to totality is quicker, and also substantial enough that you would be able to detect it even if it were slow. When it's dark enough, the color mix is different, shadows disappear, and it's actually harder to see in an absolute way. 

There is no observational evidence that the sun is a member of a binary (trinary, or more) star system, where "star" means an object that is at least ~80 times the mass of jupiter and emits energy/light via standard hydrogen fusion. Some evidence that people point to is that the majority of stars in the Galaxy (perhaps 60% or so) are binary. However, that does not mean that we are a binary system, just that we are among those which are not. There is the Nemesis star idea which was a hypothetical binary companion to the sun to account for periodic mass extinctions roughy every 26 million years (as in, the two stars would therefore be on a 26 million year period, so the companion is a few light-years away). There are two problems with that: First, that a 2010 reanalysis of the data showed that it was too periodic over the past 500 million years, during which time we've gone around the galaxy twice, and so our hypothetical binary orbits should have been perturbed and not be perfect (though others say that the precision of the geologic timescale isn't good enough to say this). But, second, we can see stars out to a few light years -- we can see small, faint stars out to thousands of light years. We have all-sky infrared surveys that should be able to pick up the faintest even star-like objects to at least a few light-years, and yet ... nothing. The other problem is what LDC3 pointed out in their answer: We should see some systematic motion of our own star in orbit around the common center of mass of the hypothetical binary. This would not be a yearly wobble, but rather it would be a slow motion of the entire sky on top of the other >1 year motions that we see. We now have very accurate astronomical records dating back at least a century of star positions, especially close stars. Even if we were on a 26 million year orbit - and especially one much shorter as some people claim - we should see effectively that our star is making a small arc, a part of a circle as it orbits the center of mass of it and the binary. We don't. There does not seem to be any systematic signal in the motions of stars that require the binary star model. So, to summarize: A binary companion simply lacks any observational data; if it existed, we should not only have been able to see it by now, but we should also observe not only the stars in our sky show a systematic motion due to our orbit around it, but we should again see THAT binary star also move very quickly, relative to other stars, as it orbits the common center of mass.
