The test to see whether degeneracy pressure is going to be significant is to compare $kT$ with the Fermi energy $E_F$ The Fermi energy is the energy level up to which all energy states would be occupied in a completely degenerate fermion gas. It is given by (for non-relativistic conditions) $$ E_F = \frac{h^2}{2m}\left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\right)^{2/3} n^{2/3},$$ where $m$ and $n$ are the mass and number density of the fermions (in this case, electrons). If $E_F \gg kT$, then the gas can be considered completely degenerate and the electrons exert a non-relativistic degeneracy pressure. If $E_F \sim 10 kT$ the electrons are partially degenerate. In both these circumstances, the pressure exerted by the electrons is much higher than they would have in a perfect gas, because a large fraction of electrons occupy high energy (and momentum) states. Degeneracy can be achieved either by having a low temperature or a high number density of fermions. In a white dwarf, electrons are completely degenerate because the number density of electrons is extremely high. In a gas giant, the electron density is nowhere near as high, but then the temperature is a lot lower and so they reach a state of partial degeneracy. The pressure of a partially degenerate gas is higher than that of a perfect gas at the same density and temperature. More importantly, the pressure is only very weakly dependent on temperature. As a gas giant radiates away its potential energy, it is able to do so whilst only contracting very slightly and the core does not become hot enough to initiate nuclear fusion. Note that degeneracy pressure and thermal pressure are not two different things. Both arise merely as a consequence of particles having a distribution of momenta and obeying (in this case) Fermi-Dirac statistics to determine how they occupy the possible energy states. The expression $P = nkT$ is simply a convenient approximation for fermions that holds only when $E_F \ll kT$ and the quantum nature of the particles is not apparent. 

As Joe Blow explains, there is an orbit, at the L2 point, 1.5 million km directly further away from the Sun/Earth, where a satellite could remain permanently in the Earth's shadow, though it would not be completely shadowed - the Sun would still appear as a narrow ring around the blocking Earth This would be a great advantage in terms of cooling the spacecraft and in terms of avoiding scattered light entering the instrument. It would allow a greater fraction of the sky to be observed at any one time, though there would still be a zone of avoidance close to the Earth/Sun. However, all the satellites (WMAP, Planck, Herschel, Gaia) that have exploited L2 have been specifically placed in "Lissajous orbits" that orbit around the L2 point and are never in the Earth's shadow. The reason is that you need the sunlight for power. Neverthless, L2 still offers a very stable thermal environment and it is still the case that a much larger proportion of the sky is viewable than from a lower Earth orbit. 

I am not sure what you mean by "thermal" pressure. Jupiter is supported by pressure, just like all objects that are in (approximate) hydrostatic equilibrium. That pressure is provided by your everyday, temperature-dependent Maxwell-Boltzmann ideal gas pressure in the outer parts, but the free electrons in the interior become degenerate and so in these regions I suppose you would more accurately describe the pressure as being due to (partial) electron degeneracy pressure. At the very centre there may be a liquid or even a solid core. In the metallic hydrogen model then this would still be degenerate electrons contributing the pressure. For a solid, rocky core, well solids are rather incompressible. You can only describe Jupiter as being in approximate hydrostatic equlibrium. It is losing energy from its surface; this energy is supplied from gravitational potential energy and Jupiter is shrinking at a rate calculated to be about 2 cm per year. As it does so, the interior gas becomes denser and more and more degenerate and the pressure will become more independent of temperature. As a result, the rate of contraction will slow down and Jupiter will tend towards the radius of a "cold" body of that composition. 

It is quite clear from the film (and the awful soundtrack) that a total eclipse was observed. The Sun's corona and prominences cannot be seen during an annular eclipse. Nor is there a sudden fading or drastic brightening at the beginning and end of an annular eclipse. The accompanying article talks about "totality" and removing safety glasses to look at the Sun during totality, and that the period of totality was 1 min 53 seconds; the (frankly, annoying) narrator shouts the word "totality" about 23 times. The eclipse was observed towards the end period of totality (what I mean by that is the shadow is tracking west to east across the Earth's surface. That means the Sun was above the western horizon as seen by the plane, and at 5:35pm, would be 10 degrees above the horizon. That means that in order to observe this event the plane must have been closer to the moon than a point on the surface of the Earth where totality would have been observed at the same time. That means the period of totality would have been slightly longer and the moon would have had a slightly larger angular size as seen from the plane. If I had the exact latitude and longitude I could tell you just how much longer the eclipse was. Messing about with Stellarium, I can get a reasonable match of the eclipse time at W157 58 35, N31 22 00. At 10,000m the eclipse is total and lasts about 70s. At sealevel at the same latitude it lasts maybe a few seconds longer (it's difficult to be sure). But the sea level region of totality observed at the same time would have been somewhat further east (but still along the path where totality was observed), where the period of totality would have been shorter. 

Consider the case of similar-mass, close binary systems. If the orbital periods are less than a few days they are expected to become tidally locked on a timescale much shorter than the stellar lifetimes. In many cases the synchronisation can be established by comparing the rotation periods of the stars using modulation by starspots with the orbital period from eclipses e.g. $URL$ In other cases you can find the projected equatorial velocities of eclipsing binary star components and show that these are consistent with the orbital period, the measured radii and the orbital inclination e.g. $URL$ ; $URL$
