The Frege-Russell logicism project, ulteriorly, was to reduce biology to chemistry, chemistry to physics, physics to math, and finally, math to logic. Theories of hypothesis testing Your question on hypothesis testing is concerned with the first ideology of logical positivism: verifiability principle. The following are theories that aimed to materialize the principle. Phase 1: Vindicationism (1920's) Initially, positivists thought that sentences must be vindicated to be meaningful and scientific. Soon they realized that vindication was impossible even at the level of scientific observations (Many claims of Einstein could not be vindicated at the time). Hypotheses in particular cannot be vindicated since it is a universal statement. ‘All ravens are black’ can never be vindicated by 1000’s observations of black ravens. By 1935, Carnap himself gave up on vindicationism which he proposed a decade ago. Phase 2: Confirmationism (1930's) Instead of vindication, Carnap now offers confirmation as the way to understand the truth of a hypothesis. If there are 1000’s observations of black ravens, then the hypothesis ‘All ravens are black; is very much confirmed. So the hypothesis approximates the truth. Carnap thus asserts that what matters is degrees of confirmation, not absolute veridication. His Logical Foundations of Probability (1950) is designed to realize his idea that probability is concerned with the logical relationship between a hypothesis and evidence. Phase 3: Falsificationism (1950's) Karl Popper, in his The Logic of Scientific Discovery (first published in German 1934: introduced to the English speaking world in 1959), having criticized confirmation as a logically invalid form of inference (the fallacy of affirming the consequent), offered falsification as the logically correct form of hypothesis testing. (I have a post on Popper’s falsificationism somewhere in Stackexchange). Phase 4: Crises (1960’s) Logical positivists were at the brink of being squeezed out due to internal and external pressures. The external pressure is the advance of a new paradigm, ushered by Thomas Kuhn. The internal pressure began with the Duhem-Quine thesis. Confirmation theorists themselves start to find paradoxes of confirmation (e.g., Hempel’s raven paradox and Goodman’s grue paradox). Does the observation of a white shoe confirm the hypothesis ‘All ravens are black’? (Hempel's Studies in the Logic of Confirmation (1965)). Does the observation of a green emerald confirm the hypothesis ‘All emeralds are green’ or ‘All emeralds are grue’? (Goodman’s The Structure of Appearance (1951) These crises incentivised logical positivists to change their name to logical empiricists. Phase 5: Bayesian confirmation (1990's) A Bayesian method became the last hope for logical empiricists. Bayesians found that the paradoxes of confirmation are solvable within the Bayesian framework. New ideas, of course, generate new (pseudo) problems (like the problems of old evidence and of new hypothesis). John Earman examined the Bayesian method in his Bayes or Bust (1992). (I know this sh** because the Bayesian methodology was my dissertation topic in my previous academic life.) Phase 6: Present The doctrines of logical empiricism are fatally attractive. The building of an empire: i.e., the unification of science! If defection is not an option, as the wise Earman once said, one should continue the imperial march of empiricism since the alternative is to get busted. For Defectors For those thinking of defection, these are some options: revolutionism (“Scientific progress is made by revolution, not by approximation.”: Thomas Kuhn), historicism (“Science is what scientists do.”: Peter Galison), Aristotelianism (“I hunted for causality all my life, and I now realize that Aristotle captured it best.”: Nancy Cartwright), and pluralism (“Biology is no slave to physics. We sciences are all equal.”: John Dupré). 

An atheist doesn't reject the possibility that one or more "gods" exist. The atheist has decided for herself or himself that the likelihood of the existence of "gods" and that such an existence could have any influence on her or his life is so low that it can be ignored. On the other hand, people who make claims that being an atheist would be in some way unscientific, similar to a fundamentalist muslim or similar, that does affect an atheist, and will make him object. 

A "zero-sum" game is one where everything that the winner or winners gain is exactly the same as what the loser or losers lose. Obviously a zero-sum game can be very unjust. If I steal $100 from your pocket, I win $100 and you lose $100, so it's a zero-sum game. If I steal $100 from your pocket by slitting open your pocket, I win $100 and you lose $100 plus your damaged trousers, so we don't have a zero-sum game but an overall loss. So the claim is that justice will always benefit one person in exactly the same way as it damages another person. This seems unlikely. In the first place, it claims that getting justice will come for free which is unlikely to be true in most cases. On the other hand, it claims that justice can never be beneficial for both sides. If a thief stealing $100 is plagued by bad conscience that makes him lose his sleep, and he is forced to return the money, he might actually benefit if his bad conscience goes away and he can sleep in the night again - many people would gladly pay $100 for being able to sleep through the night, so that would be a case where both sides actually could benefit. 

Since I do not think Pascal's argument is fallacious, and since I detest a long post, I offer this second post, as an appendix. Pascal's question is whether he should believe in God (the paradigm relating to the Christian God: e.g., Soul lives after one's death; Believing in God is necessary for the eternal salvation of the soul, which is the most important thing one can hope for). These are essential assumptions of Pascal: Pascal 1. Either God exist or does not exist. Pascal 2. Either I should believe in God or should not believe in God. Pascal 3. Based on the Christian paradigm, the following payoff table obtains: 

Just to get the discussion going, I offer my response. The situation is that you think your contractor commits a fallacy when she asserts, "[Since] most security breaches are committed (intentionally or unintentionally) by inside employees, it should be concluded that trust cannot be given to employees." You offer some reasons. I follow your reasoning to determine what the name of the fallacy might be. Initially you suggest that the argument commits some causal fallacy. Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc ( After This, Therefore Because of This) is the name for a causal fallacy. The fallacy is committed when a person confuses a sequential relationship (or correlation) for a causal relationship. But I do not see her argument makes any causal claim. So not is Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc. Your second idea is that security breaches are irrelevant to trustworthiness, as you separate a bad action by a person from the character of the person. In this case, her argument can be viewed as committing Non Sequitur (not follow), which occurs when the conclusion is supported by irrelevant premises. So you can argue that one may not conclude untrustworthiness from security breaches. My problem with identifying the argument with Non Sequitur, however, is that security breaches do seem to be relevant to trustworthiness. The contractor should have meant trust differently from yours. While you interpret trust as a value-laden concept (good or bad), the contractor should have meant trust with reliability, a value-neutral concept. There is no absurdity in saying that we cannot rely on those who are prone to security breach. One suggestion is to argue for the fallacy of division.The fallacy of division occurs when one infers mistakenly that since A is a part of B, and since B has the property X, A must have X. For instance, since the roof is the part of house, and since the house is painted white, one mistakenly infers that the roof must be painted white. The common sense however is that when we say white house, we mean only the exterior walls of the house. Applying the fallacy, you can argue that the contractor is mistaken to think that, since the majority security breaches happen by the employees, it will also happen by your employees. You can rebut that your employees do not share the property (breaching security) since they are qualitatively different (e.g., they met the govt security clearance). But if your employees are representative of the pool of all employees, then the contractor’s claim is not fallacious. Depending on the situation and interpretation, the contractor’s argument might not be committing a fallacy at all. The disagreements between you and you contract can be just the reflection of two competing goals in doing business: security and efficiency. 

Rules in a civil trial and a criminal trial are different. What I say should be only applied to criminal trial. When someone is accused of a crime, there isn't just "guilty" and "not guilty". Many actions could be different crimes depending on the circumstances - like theft, robbery or armed robbery, like manslaughter, second degree or first degree murder. So a lawyer might be very well aware that the client stole money or killed someone, but the client might be guilty of theft and not armed robbery, or manslaughter and not first degree murder, so even knowing that the client is guilty, the lawyer would still be expected to give his best defence. Many crimes can have mitigating circumstances. A person killing their spouse after ten years of being abused, and another person killing their spouse who dares defending themselves after ten years of being abused, should be treated differently, and the lawyer should do their best to make all mitigating circumstances for their client count. And there is the prosecutor. The prosecutor is not there to get a fair judgement, but will try to get the maximum punishment. Likewise, the lawyer is not there to get a fair judgement for their client, but the least possible punishment. The judge being between them is responsible for a fair judgement. The lawyer must do his best to represent the client, or the judgement will not be fair. Since I was asked: The case of Aaron Swartz and prosecutor Carmen Ortiz looks very much like a case where a prosecutor tried to get a maximum sentence, way beyond what looked to be justified. That is a case of "knowingly" looking for a sentence that exceeds the crime. But on the other hand, I didn't say that prosecutors generally "knowingly" ask for punishment that exceeds the crime, but it is obvious that in any single case where an innocent person appears in court, the prosecutor at least unknowingly asks for punishment that exceeds the non-existing crime. 

Now, let Biden and Obama be interpreted in the following way (leaving the rest of the non-logical terms intact): 

Let's see whether there is a solution to your question through the method of eliminative induction. Let's call your premise the duty of beneficence: 

Talking about philosophy and sex, St Augustine's and Immanuel Kant's got to be mentioned: the former for its hilarity and the latter for its consistency with theory and practice. St. Augustine, torn between his mother's Christianism and his father's Manicheanism during his formative years, is famously known for his pray: "Lord, give me chastity and temperance, but not now." Kant, despite his life as a single man, is known for his condemnation of wanton self-pleasure (= masturbation). To Kant such pleasuring is immoral since it is treating oneself as a mere means, which violates his humanity doctrine, which states that we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity, whether in ourselves or in others, as a means only but always as an end in itself. 

Most suicides are committed due to mental health problems, and are not based on any rational decision. Since the victims are not thinking clear, they may have a plan to kill themselves, but no alternative plans. So you get a massive chance of saving someone's life without restricting them much by removing their intended means of committing suicide. Removing a gun or ammunition, or removing a stash of sleeping tablets, these are very helpful ways of helping a suicidal person. I hope you were looking for a practical way to help. Discussing the ethics of suicide out of curiosity and because it makes for an interesting subject would be deeply unethical. And after careful reading: Should I ever have the bad luck to be in a situation where suicide is a rational choice (which I seriously hope will never happen), what do you think would I do about it? 

Problem: a spoiled brat who has everything still is unhappy Philosophers are still in debate. Until we know what happiness is constitutive of, we cannot build a pleasure machine. 

Boyd’s argument for scientific realism (scientific entities exist independently of us, and also have causal role phenomenally) looks circular due to the fact that the theses are posited without support. He states they are “philosophically uncontroversial.” I am suspicious whether he can hold the three theses consistently (I will not pursue this line of thought for the lack of time) 

The ethicist we are looking for must acknowledge that there exists the duty of beneficence. Libertarians (Robert Nozick and Ann Landers) are eliminated. 

The argument also assumes that a person is composed of the body and the soul (your premise 2). But many materialists believe that all mental states, including the soul whatever that is made of or does, are reduced to the brain states. To them, the soul dies when the body dies, just as a smartphone dies when it is drowned. 

Wittgenstein thought that he solved questions and problems that belong to this conception of philosophy -that he finally ended with "metaphysical swamps". But what about the second conception of philosophy? What is it? It answers your second question. The primary task of every future philosophy is now elucidatory. Philosophy becomes a skill, practice. Philosopher doesn't offer any new theories; he reveals nonsense: 

There is good and evil. The Good tries with all it's power to prevent The Evil from doing more evil (otherwise the Good wouldn't be the Good). A possible world is the best world if it contains maximum distribution of good and minimum distribution of evil among all other possible worlds. Therefore we constantly live in the best of all possible worlds. 

Question for those who are "beyond good and evil": if there's no good and evil, how can we still argue that we live in the best possible world? Does it make sense? Question for those who believe in good and evil but reject the argument: how is it possible to criticize above argument and deny that we live in the best possible world? Question for those who accept the argument: are there any practical consequences for believing in this argument? Can this argument profoundly change a person's worldview or is it mere formal logical proposition? If I say such things, won't I sound stupid or childish? 

Civil society is founded on two notions of justice: absolute justice and proportional justice, a la Aristotle. Absolute justice applies to all members of society for the reason that they meet certain qualification. For instance, any human objects are guaranteed with basic rights for the reason of being human. Proportional justice is founded on the idea of deservingness: those who work hard or are efficient users of their talents should be rewarded more than talent wasters or unincentivized people. Historically, people have disagreed on the domains of absolute and proportional justice. The right to vote for representatives, for instance, used to belong to the domain of proportional justice (19th century). Many now think the right to a democratic say (voting right) belongs to the domain of absolute justice. The marriage right of same sex people is only recently viewed as the basic right: previously same sex marriage was viewed as an inefficient use of talents (no offspring). Naturally, the delineation between basic and non-basic rights is circumstantial, cultural, sociological, political. Now, to answer your question, most present societies view matters relating to knowledge and talent belong to the realm of proportional justice. Thus when universities and businesses treat individuals preferentially based on talent and knowledge, they are not viewed as discriminating people on these bases. 

There are many intelligent people in the world who are not very good as programmers, or who don't have any interest in writing software. So if we created an Artificial Intelligence, what reason is there to think it would be a good, or decent, or at least not completely incompetent programmer? What reason is there to think it would be capable of being a programmer without growing up for close to 20 years, followed by some significant amount of training? What reason is there to think Artificial Intelligences capable of writing software would be able to do it in such huge amounts at a cost that making them replace all programmers would be cost effective? If I needed to pay a $1 million dollar bill a year for servers to run an "Artificial Intelligence" program that can replace a single programmer, why would anyone pay that money? There is a huge gap between an Artificial Intelligence, and an Artificial Intelligence capable of replacing a programmer cost effectively. Same as there is a huge gap between an Artificial Intelligence that can create a simple melody, and one that is better than Beethoven at composing music. At some point in 100 years or so, when a group of AIs goes through all the StackExchange questions and supplies perfect answers to all the questions, we'll get an answer that can express my thoughts on the subject much better than I can. 

The question is how much well-informed citizens need to be to exercise their democratic rights. The answer depends on theories of democracy. The duty of citizens to be well-informed can be very demanding or not demanding at all. Some theories even require moral duty not to vote. I explain these three views in the following. J.S. Mill's theory can be argued to be very demanding. In Considerations on Representative Government, Mill posits the thesis of the inequivalence of the peoples. The thesis states that the people of democracy are intelligent and active while the people of a benevolent despot are vapid and torpid. The thesis then entails that, even if the outcomes of the benevolent despot and democracy are the same in terms of promoting the public good, there is reason to choose democracy. According to Mill, democratic citizens are active and intelligent since, to exercise their rights to vote, the people of democracy will have to study political issues and agenda in search of the public good. For this reason, Mill called democracy the school of public spirit. To ensure this, Mill ponders on public voting that people can see how each others voted. Mill infamously proposed plural voting (that the educated should have more votes than the uneducated) to ensure that voting results reflect the public good. Many theories of voting are not as demanding as Mill's. Reasons vary, however. I offer two scholarly arguments for the reason. One is to view the democratic decision making process as a machine. That is, by merely implementing universal and uniformly-weighted franchise, correct answer for the public good will rise to the top. The idea is most strongly supported by Condorcet Jury Theorem, which states that, if each voter is more likely to vote correctly, and independently, then the majority will find the correct answer with certainty as the number of voters increases. James Surowiecki popularized this idea with The Wisdom of Crowds. Under this view, individuals can just vote based on what they already know, and there is no need to be well informed. StackExchage and Quora utilize this wisdom of crowd to find the truth (or knowledge). The other reason is based on non-epistemic nature of democratic decisions. This view used to be popular thanks to the contribution of social choice theories. The premise for this view is that the core of democratic decisions is empty (non-epistemic due to cyclicity). Then why should we vote? Their answer is similar to the way moral anti-realists explain our moral responses: "Hooray" or "Boo." We vote to approve or disapprove policies or representatives. Under this view, voting is like cheering for your favorite football team, and thus unnecessary is being well-informed. A San Diegan would cheer for Chargers however poorly they performed in the games. The third view is that it is morally impermissible for uninformed citizens to vote. This view is articulated by Jason Brennan in his The Ethics of Voting. To him, voting is to find the correct answer for public policies and thus ignorance will get in the way in this pursuit of the truth. The argument clearly assumes the correct answer and can be unpersuasive to political skeptics.
