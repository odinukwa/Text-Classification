Source: J.J. Saunders, The History of the Mongol Conquests, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001) [No page provided, but presumably around p 222.] Either way, both hint at some amount of hubris on top of being unaware that a bigger army was nearby. 

Well functioning societies usually turn the page when they realize that they did something wrong or that their enemies did; they bury the hatchet and look towards the future instead. In this spirit, part of ending a war usually involves a large degree of forgiveness of the general population and most or all of its leaders. What more, (West) Germany has been a vibrant democracy with a deep attachment to human rights since WW2, and a notoriously tolerant one at that. (In case searching for counter-examples of hate groups or human rights abuses crosses your mind, yes it's not perfect but keep context in mind: several US states had racial segregation enshrined in law until the 60s.) For all of Germany's flaws in welcoming immigrants and refugees, other countries have plenty of good lessons to learn from what it's been doing since WW2, and Germany is (IMO) thus entitled to some clout. 

My memory might serve me wrong, but I seem to recollect quite a few pundits pointing out that nobody in recent memory had ever won a war in Afghanistan when G. W. Bush wanted to go there. This impression certainly wasn't universal then - and indeed there were quite a few hawks. But the notion that Afghanistan was an unwindable war was widespread insofar as I can recollect. And sure enough, here we are more than a dozen years later and it still isn't a won war, as feared by many in and out of the US when the US went there. 

But then, he - and other internet references I ran into - throws in a "typically" just in case, and offers no sources or references in the page notes to support the assertion. This much I would suggest, though. A legend holds that Robespierre was placed face up and it would have been unusual and crazy enough that the legend lives on to this day. Seeing that there are no such legends about other people, methinks it's reasonable to assume it seldom if ever occurred during the French Revolution - else for sure you'd also hear about this or that other legendary person who lost their head face up, either as an act of added cruelty or bravery. (In passing, one runs into other web pages that suggest that the Nazis were using guillotines face up, for the added cruelty.) 

The Domesday Book was exceptional in its time period, both for having been done to begin with and for its magnitude. Regular and systematic censuses weren't a thing until - depending on the country - the industrial revolution was around the corner or in full motion. For instance, France conducted its first modern census under Napoleon in 1801. 

From reading the two wikipedia articles, they had different opinions on how the air force should be used in war theaters. Douhet offers (emphasis mine): 

Sugar cane in the Caribbean comes to mind. The islands were sporting single purpose economies for all practical intents, much like a number of OPEC countries do. It was extremely valuable, too. In the aftermath of the 7 years war, France preferred to give up its Canadian possessions to keep Guadeloupe and Martinique. The parallel extends somewhat in that sugar cane's importance declined after sugar beet became widespread, leaving many an island without much of an economy. 

If you go back enough in time it's possible, in that pre-islamic religion in the Arab Peninsula was a mix of polytheism, Christianity, Judaism, and Iranian religions. But it's implausible that one would be able to trace the family's dominant faith that far back in time. The House of Saud was founded in 1744, with origins only tracing back to the mid-15th century - that is, well after Islam was mainstream in the area, and I'd gather the house' wikipedia page would be full of documented references if the family had been anything but Muslim during that time. The two dominant faiths in the tribal federation they purportedly descend from before that appears to have been Christianity and polytheism, so it's more likely that their ancestors were one or the other (or for that matter, both). But since there are no records for the Saud family in those times it's dubious to claim anything for sure. On that note, there's also a word to be said about how far back one must go to label someone as having such and such ancestry. And everyone probably is of polytheist descent if you go back in time enough. 

Microsoft basically took advantage of the growth: it bundled Word and Excel into as many new PCs as it could. In the early days of the PC, growth was so phenomenal that more new PCs were sometimes sold in a year than in the history of computers. In such a context, if you bundle your software with every PC sold (in exchange for, say, Windows), you'll have over 50% of the market installed next year, over 75% in two years, etc. It doesn't matter if your product isn't better or perfect - it'll be good enough for many. (And by around windows 3.1, both pieces of software were decidedly better if memory serves me well. Then again I wasn't playing around with the alternatives much.) 

It might be. For reference, sperm whales and dolphins seem to be giving each other names too. I'm not finding any indication through cursory googling that chimps or bonobos are doing so as well, but I wouldn't be too surprised if they did so too. 

There's a rather extensive section, by Wikipedia standards anyway, on the history of bathing. Long story short, regular bathing has always been encouraged. There was a mild decline in Europe during the switch from wool to linen clothing around the 16th century or so. At the time clean clothing became vaguely associated with cleanliness, and accepted medical theory then supported this view somewhat. There was also a vague fear of water not being good because they knew that skin is porous. But bathing never went entirely out of fashion, and this downward trend reversed in the mid-18th century or so when it became generally accepted that reasonably frequent bathing improved health. That being said, in the case of cities there's also something to be said about sanitation. That is, the presence, or indeed absence, of trash disposal and sewer systems. Street crossings in Pompeii in this respect are telling: 

Cursory googling suggests they were always face down during the French Revolution. The Aftermath of the French Revolution by James R Arnold, for instance, notes in the Robespierre entry that: 

Per your other question on the topic, the US was hardly shackled by public debt at the time. It was a few percent of the GDP, i.e. on the order of a rounding error compared to other major drivers of economic activity at the time. There was prosperity in 1834-1836 followed by a financial crisis in 1837, which economists attribute to external factors beyond US control much more than to Jackson's Bank War. As to whether having zero debt is good or bad, there's precious little no public debt experience to draw on, be it in the US or elsewhere in modern times, so you can't really compare how not having debt fares against having some. 

There was a north-south trade route with a long history between Zanzibar and the Horn of Africa and beyond through Mombasa and Mogadishu. Just guessing, but it would seem natural for the Zimbabwe area's trade to feed into the latter, likely through Tete (where the Swahili operated a trade outpost before the Portuguese arrived) and the Zambezi. I've no idea if there also was inland trade with kingdoms and tribes in the Great Lakes areas, but given how the Zambezi flows towards Central Africa it would seem reasonably natural for trade to have occurred upstream as well. 

Wars are usually fought because of some combination of fear, honor, or interest - even when the stated rational is or seems closer to nationalism or fear mongering. You can't really put much of a pattern forward beyond that without inspecting the causes of each individual war. Even then, filing a particular war declaration under a single reason will usually not pass a sniff test. It's never strictly about "scarcity of resources". Things instantly get murkier when you factor in historical and international context. Take for instance the various barbarian invasions during the fall of the western Roman Empire. A naive glance at the subject could mislead one to think that they were strictly after loot and land. Maybe even just waiting for Rome to be weak enough that they can start pouring into the empire. But a closer look reveals the even nastier hordes of Huns that was displacing them from the East. 

I take it that by "based on the heraldic rules used when making flags from the colors of coat-of-arms" the page's author means the heraldry rule whereby you're supposed to interlace colors (that is, green, red, blue, etc.) with metal (gold or silver) so that colors only touch metal and vice versa. If memory serves, black and white could be used as either color or metal. There's a bunch more historical flags on this other page from the same site, which notes in passing on the 1477 old town flag's entry that: 

There are many more authentic places in Europe. Cursory googling for things like "medieval town Europe" yields plenty of other examples. 

Life expectancy at birth isn't such a great data point, when half or more newborns don't make it to adulthood or when women frequently die while giving birth. Both of the latter issues were common, for the rich and poor alike, until well into the industrial revolution (end of the 19th), so it's more interesting to look at life expectancy after childhood. There were regular pandemics at the time. Diseases occasionally affect the lower classes more than the upper ones to some degree or vice versa, and the Plague may have affected the former a tiny bit more than the latter (who could afford to flee) - but this is a far cry from the degree by which Cholera was a poor's disease first and foremost in the 19th. Other major life shorteners of the time, like Smallpox, similarly were equal opportunity pests. Famines were a thing in the past. They were a major killer that disproportionally affected the lower classes. 

No idea where it's from, but the quote likely is a less cryptic variation of "foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds." (A related and more cynical French variation is that "promises only commit those who listen to them".) That is, he means to raise awareness that a promise, belief, opinion, statement, etc. is only valid within a certain context. Should the context change, the promise, belief, opinion, statement, etc. may continue to hold, or it may very well fly out the window. Imagine for instance that you're offered a quote for something at $X. You say "Yes!" But then, a few moments later, all sorts of hidden costs get thrown in - a murky sales technique called low balling. Many people will unfortunately keep their earlier commitment; the quote is a reminder that you can reverse it - since the context changed - and shouldn't feel sorry for whoever you promised a sale to. 

It's likely because of presumed medical properties. This page (in French), for instance, offers that Gypsum (called both Gypse and Albâtre in French) as a component to make skin rejuvenating creams in Ancient Egypt. There are a few sensible sources at the bottom of the page to back the claim. This dictionary of Medical Matter from 1837 (in French) offers that sodium carbonate ("Albâtre calcaire") had been used as an absorbent against stomach pain and diarrhea, as well as against scurvy, and that gypsum proper, or calcium sulfate, had been used according to Paul of Aegina against stomach diseases. That is, IMHO, the most likely source of why it might have been absorbed for and attributed with medical properties. In more modern times, this dictionary of medicine, surgury and pharmacy from 1834 (in French) also offers that gypsum was used to soften tumors. I would add: don't discount hocus pocus reasons. This other page (French yet again) holds without citing a source that Gypsium (under Albâtre) has a slew of esoteric benefits, including appeasing effects, self-confidence, bone benefits, and improvements when visiting your radiologist to detect liquid elements if you happen to be hold it in a certain way. If the couple of times I interacted with people who were into would-be properties of crystals are anything to go by, there's an ages old laundry list of beliefs on mineral topics and I wouldn't be surprised the slightest if at least a few of these benefits originate from alchemy treaties, religious beliefs, obscure classical treaties, etc. that got passed on through generations after countless rounds of Chinese whispers. 

Mindsets and the standards of troop behavior eventually evolved. Restraint was expected by the early 20th century. To illustrate this, consider how Kaiser Wilhelm II sent his German troops to China as part of the punitive expedition against the Boxer Rebellion: he instructed them to show no restraints and basically behave like Huns. The anecdote is particularly telling, but not because it shocked some at the time or because it was used a few years later for WW1 propaganda purposes. Rather, it's because behaving like Huns would have been such a matter of course a few centuries earlier that it would not have been worth mentioning. Times had changed. 

Regnault proposed a motion to introduce the tie breaking mechanism, all while suggesting the original idea stemmed from an earlier speech on the best ballot mode by de Mirabeau. Such a law, continues the explanation, would honor the constitution in that it ensures virtue gets rewarded. The archive then sheds some light on what the intended meaning of virtue is. Namely, a patriarch figure. They considered giving a preference to married men, disrating former husbands who had divorced, and taking the number of children into account - all of which got rejected after a lively if polite debate. 

That line of thought is not without reasons. Simplistically: The world order before WW1 had the UK copping the seas. Germany sought to challenge the UK's naval supremacy and engaged in a naval arms race with them. This led the UK to bury its hatchet and cooperate with France, its historical rival. Germany had no shortage of brazen rhetoric and behavior in the years leading to the war. In 1905 Wilhelm II came to Tangier and denounced French influence in Morocco. Edward VII denounced it as "the most mischievous and uncalled for event which the German Emperor has been engaged in since he came to the throne." There was another major Moroccan crisis in 1911 when Germany sent a gunboat to Agadir. The weeks leading to the war are also worth a mention. Wilhelm II offered unconditional support to Austria. They later sent ultimatums to Russia (who was pre-mobilizing) and France (who had made its support to Russia clear). France was required it to stay neutral in the coming war and hand over some border forts as a guarantee - i.e. not acceptable. Then, anticipating that Russia would declare on Austria to defend Serbia, Germany declared on Russia. And anticipating that France would back Russia, it declared on France. The UK entered the war over Belgium the next day. It's worth noting here that these events all occurred before Russia had actually come to Serbia's rescue against Austria; it actually was Austria that ended up declaring on Russia two days later. Austria was not without fault of its own. In particular, it sent Serbia a humiliating ultimatum. Each of its points basically got accepted except one. (Some historians disagree on how to interpret Serbia's reply. Clark in particular described it as a "highly perfumed rejection on most points.") Either way, Wilhelm II commented that it's "a great moral victory for Vienna, but with it, every reason for war disappears." Austria went on to declare war on Serbia regardless. So, put another way, Germany (and Austria) had an aggressive attitude before the war. And while Austria fired the first shots by declaring war on Serbia, it was Germany that ultimately lit the powder keg in anticipation of the subsequent reactions. As such, thinking of them as the bad guys isn't that big a stretch, and the Treaty of Versailles enshrined this with a (controversial) provision whereby Germany accepted the responsibility for causing the war. 

My understanding is that the gold/silver value was different in Europe (~1:12) and in the Far East (~1:6), so it was quite beneficial for European traders to buy everything in Asia using silver and come back with gold and goods. China was also peculiar in the sense that they wanted essentially nothing from Europeans, feeling they had superior goods in just about every ways. It wasn't until when the opium trade kicked off that Europeans had anything of value besides silver to offer the Chinese. Source: J.M.
