Then, I encountered John Plumbe. He and his chain of Daguerreotype galleries from 1840-1847 are a good example of what I was looking for. I was looking at too late of a time period. Thanks to RI Swamp Yankee mentioning the Daguerreotype. Overall, it seems that a Daguerreotype studio gave way over time to the photography studio. As it remains today, it was a relatively inexpensive business to get into and one that has a lot of turnover. 

The Panzer I, the tank sent to Spain, was initially designed as an "industrial tractor" in order to get around arms controls agreements. It had a number of limitations ranging from slow speed to engine problems to inadequate armor to less effective armament. It's primary/original purpose was for the German command to teach soldiers armored warfare while not having treaty breaking armor. The Soviet built T-26 was a much better design and taken from the successful British Vickers tanks. It, like a lot of Soviet armaments, was easy to manufacture and maintain and simple for the average soldier to use. The T-34 continued this trend. The Panzer III and IV were the main battle tanks when WWII started in 1939. These tanks did well against the unprepared French and British forces. When the invasion of the USSR began, it became clear that these tanks had inferior guns. Superior armor tactics, however, gave the Germans about a 6:1 kill ratio over the Soviets. The Tiger was still in the design phase during the late 1930's. It incorporated the famous German 88mm cannon and sported heavier armor than any contemporary tank. It suffered from being so technically advanced, making it expensive to build, difficult to maintain and prone to mechanical breakdown and malfunction. It was first deployed to North Africa and the Eastern front in 1942. Due to Allied bombing and the complexity and cost, the Tiger didn't see a wide deployment. Allied tank tactics used the low numbers to their advantage through flanking maneuvers that the outnumbered Germans couldn't effectively counter. 

The purpose of to industrialize the mass execution of Jews and other "undesirables". Prior to creating the execution camps, the Nazis had executed considerable numbers of people "on the spot". This was a time consuming process not only for the actual execution but the sanitary disposal of bodies afterward. Considering that the regime was planning on executing between 12-15 million people, industrialization made sense. Also, there was concern about the public reaction to performing the mass murder out in the open. By creating the convenient fiction that they were being sent to "relocation" camps, it allowed the German public to pretend not to notice what was really going on. Public outcry would be an even greater risk in occupied/allied nations like France, Romania and Hungary. If you want to get some further info on it, read about the Wannsee Conference and watch the fairly accurate docu-drama Conspiracy that depicts this meeting. 

In 1796, Napoleon invaded Italy and defeated the papal army. The French troops took Pope VI prisoner and he died in captivity seven months later. The risks to a politician in antagonizing such a powerful entity as the Vatican are enormous while the tangible benefits are little. Unlike other colonized countries, the Vatican does not have much natural resources or workers to exploit. However, being a major religion in Europe, the support it holds in the European population is mighty. Even today when the political power of Christian leaders has waned compared to hundreds of years ago, very few(or zero) Western leaders dare to offend the Church. It does not look like a smart move by Napoleon to antagonize the all-powerful Catholic Church unless there are huge advantages to be gained. What advantages did Napoleon gain by attacking and antagonizing the Catholic Church? This question assumes that Napoleon was a shrewd politician who made calculated moves and not a hot-tempered person who makes decisions on his whims (I don't like you, so I attack). 

It has often been said that world trade and investment between nations makes war between nations an irrational act. If your trading partner is hurt, it hurts your own wallet as well because you lose the profit from trade. I have been reminded several times that world trade will prevent world war. Today, the world is enjoying globalisation and prosperity from global trade. The globalisation before World War I look similar to today's situation. $URL$ 

In 1949, Britain devalued the pound sterling by 30%. This was a major world economic event given that the pound was and still is one of the major currencies in the world. In fact, 9 other countries followed suit then. They were Australia, India, South Africa, New Zealand, Eire, Denmark, Norway, Egypt, and Israel. Interestingly, several among those who devalued were former British colonies. Given that savings are destroyed in a currency devaluation, it should be interpreted as a disaster and outrage. Yet, this move was praised as a constructive step ($URL$ What factors led to the devaluation of pound sterling in 1949 by 30%? 

President Andrew Jackson totally eliminated U.S national debt in 1835. Did the U.S economy boom in the aftermath of debt elimination as a result of not being shackled by debt? Was it good economic policy for a country to have zero debt based on U.S historical experience? 

There are a number of reasons why the Germans did not pull back for the defense of Berlin. The short answer is that they simply couldn't. The Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS were still ordered to conduct major offensives even in 1945. The Battle of the Bulge was the last major German offensive in the West, but upon its failure elite units from I and II SS Panzer Corps (which had participated in the Battle of the Bulge) were sent to the East and ordered to conduct another major offensive called Operation Spring Awakening. Spring Awakening took place as far east as Hungary and as late in the war as March 1945. It was the last major German offensive in the East and was a failure. The Soviets had well prepared defenses against the German offensive and had prepared a major offensive of their own. They launched a massive counterattack after Spring Awakening failed. The German units were overrun while the Soviets raced toward Berlin. Soviet units raced each other to Berlin to claim the distinction of capturing the Nazi capital. The Soviets covered ground quickly: they broke through the last major German defensive line on April 19, started shelling Berlin itself on April 20 (Hitler's birthday), and captured Berlin by May 2. The quick Soviet victory was due not only to their motivation to capture Berlin, but also by the fact that the Soviets had over 1 million troops against only about 100,000 German defenders. Meanwhile, the surviving German units that had been overrun were low on fuel for what little armor they had left and could not hope to catch the Soviets racing to Berlin. Even if the Wehrmacht had the fuel and armor to retreat back to Berlin in time they were often ordered by Hitler not to retreat at any cost, which often resulted in their encirclement and destruction. These overrun units probably would not have made much difference anyway given the vast Soviet numerical superiority. The story was largely the same for the Luftwaffe. At the beginning of 1945 the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte to support German ground units during the Battle of the Bulge but the operation was a failure resulting in the loss of a large number of aircraft and pilots. By this time the Allied air forces were much stronger than the Luftwaffe, which was suffering from severe shortages in aircraft, fuel, and pilots (and many Luftwaffe fighters were destroyed on the ground). With such severe shortages Luftwaffe personnel were typically assigned to help the Wehrmacht Heer, Waffen-SS, and the Volkssturm in a ground role (operating the feared 88s, for example). Remnants of some Luftwaffe units were still able to fly limited combat missions (including the famous JG 52, which operated in Czechoslovakia) in support of local German ground forces, but they were so short on pilots and aircraft that they had no hope of inflicting serious damage to Soviet air or ground units. In summary, the best German units were sent far into the east for a final offensive and were overrun. The Soviets had prepared a massive offensive and quickly crushed the German defenders before the overrun German units would have had a chance to fall back to defend Berlin. The Luftwaffe could do little to help due to aircraft and pilot shortages, so Luftwaffe personnel typically supported the defense of Berlin in a ground role. For further reading on this topic I would suggest: Panzer Leader by General Heinz Guderian Men of Steel: I SS Panzer Corps by Michael Reynolds Sons of the Reich: II SS Panzer Corps by Michael Reynolds The Blond Knight of Germany: A biography of Erich Hartmann, by Raymond Toliver and Trevor Constable (Erich Hartmann is the most famous member of JG 52 and the book describes his actions at the end of the war) 

World War I victors imposed severe war reparations on Germany. When Germany defaulted, France invaded the Ruhr which was the most heavily industrialized area in Germany to force reparations themselves. If Germany persists in default, it risks further invasion. The easy way out was to print money and inflate the debt away. One can argue that Germany had really no choice but to print money. Because the war reparations were so huge, the money printing was excessive. This created the conditions for hyperinflation to happen later. Were the heavy war reparations after World War I the main cause of hyperinflation in Germany in 1923? 

Debtors' prison is a prison for people who are unable to pay debt. As recently as the mid 19th century, it was a common way to deal with unpaid debt in Western Europe. Debtors' prison started to disappear since the start of the 20th century. Today, none of the major economies practise it anymore. What were the factors that caused debtors' prison to disappear in most parts of the world in the 20th century? 

$URL$ This is most puzzling. What were the conditions and events then that led to the anomaly? Another interesting development was that one of the greatest bear bond market followed after the end of World War II. The bear market ended with 15% yield, killed by Paul Volcker in the early 1980s. 

It is amazing Switzerland was able to stay neutral. It is not just a matter of choice and only up to Switzerland. Each side of the warring faction can take this hard stand "If you are not for me, then you are against me". Besides, Switzerland is in the middle of the warring action geographically. How did Switzerland remain neutral? It is an amazing feat. 

The Rothschild family was possibly the richest banking family in human history. Given the power of compounding over time and the large principal sum that they start with, they should easily be the world's richest family today. Besides, bankers should be pretty good money managers themselves and they should be quite competent in managing their own money. Yet today, nobody on Forbes' list of 500 richest persons in the world bears the surname Rothschild. What happened to the wealth of the Rothschild banking family over the years?
