The closest we can get to an answer would be by looking at previous exits from currency unions. Rose published a paper studying extensively all exits after WWII. The abstract resumes well the conclusions of the paper: 

I think the good way to do that is to introduce the Expenditure function which awesomely solves your problem. 

Good $x$ and $y$ enjoy some degree of substitution in both countries' aggregate demand Good $x$ and $y$ cannot be substituted completely one for another in any of the two countries (ie no matter what quantity of $x$ the consumers are offered, they will not give up there last unit of $y$), 

I believe (and eBay seems to agree with me) the system was designed to encourage proxy bidding. Proxy bidding is the best possible strategy for eBay. Proxy bidding Proxy bidding is a pretty simple system: you tell a tier (the proxy) the maximum price you're ready to pay for an item and send him to the auction. Hopefully he will get the item for less than the price. Every time the auction stalls at a lower price than your max bid, your proxy will increment the price by 5$ (or some other arbitrary amount). Why eBay likes it Because if 2 bidders are willing to pay more than $M$ for an item, eBay is sure to sell it for more than $M$ (the proxies beat each other to $M$). This kind of defeats any strategy from the bidder to get the item for less than $M$ except if he is the only one using a proxy. Why sniping encourages proxy Fixed time bidding allows snipers to defeat people at bids lower than their maximum bid. As a consequence, it makes any bid other than the maximum price you're ready to pay a risky bid: the item might go at a lower price than your max, to someone else than you. People don't like this, and so are more likely to bid higher. 

The effect denoted are very small, which leads me to conclude the choice should be made on political, not economical grounds, but everybody is free to have their own answer about this. 

The problem in your question is the "and vice versa". To give a very simplistic view, the problem in the 2008 crisis was not on production side - companies had enough to produce, but no-one to sell to. Given this, excess commodities found no buyers, even as the price lowers. The inverse correlation of stocks and commodities supposes full capital use, which is not the case during the 2008 crisis. Globally, the correlation between commodities and other stocks is around 0, though during full capital use periods it does tend to be negative, there is usually a positive correlation during crisis. 

$L$ is labor, which is equal to population in Solow-Swan model. Solow did not actually believe the workforce and population had the same size, but what's important is that labor is supposed to be in direct relationship with population i.e. there is a number w between 0 and 1 such that $L = w *$ population Direct proportionality between population and workforce is one of the assumptions of the Solow model. 

What you're failing to consider here is that in buying a large amount of shares, the buyer also makes the price high for himself. And if he sells a large amount of shares at the same time, he's likely to lower the price of the actions while selling them. Poor boy has no chance. 

Image courtesy $URL$ Consumer surplus is the sum (integral) of differences between the price each consumer would have payed and the price they got to pay. You need to find out the area of the green zone on the above graph, in the case of your model. 

Banks (and other firms), do not leverage their fortunes, they leverage their investment power. Individuals, often through family trusts, may use the same tool, of course. This does not allow for more spending but for more investment. Given expected benefit higher than the cost of leverage, this can be a good way to invest more, but remember that leveraged funds can only be spent on activity that generates revenues, because both interest and capital has to be payed back in the end. This does increase the impact of big players in the economy, but does not change their purchasing power, just their investing power. 

First, we want to find the optimal good baskets, ie how much to buy of goods $x$,$y$ and $z$ to get the maximum value of U out of it. Let's write down the $MRS$ for $x$ and $y$ against $z$. For this we need to differentiate the utility function for each of the variables: $d_xU(x,y,z)=a/x$ , $d_yU(x,y,z)=b/y$,$d_zU(z,y,z)=1$. We hence deduce the rates of substitution to be $-1a/x$ and $-b/y$ respectively. So we have: $p_x/p_z=a/x$ and $p_y/p_z=b/y$ The budget constraint is $p_xx+p_yy+p_zz=I$ which we rewrite $p_x(ap_z/p_x)+p_y(bp_z/p_y)+p_zz=I$, which simplfies in $ap_z+bp_z+zp_z=I$ $z^*=(I/p_z)-a-b$ $(x^*,y^*,z^*)=(ap_z/p_x, bp_z/p_y,(I/p_z)-a-b)$ Good news, you were right :). The cross price effect is the rise of demand in good $x$ following a rise in the price of good $z$. Just calculate the difference between $x^*$ for $p_z$ and $x^*$ for $p_z'=p_z+\epsilon$ (using $x^*=ap_z/p_x$). Finally, the six curves asked are how demand change when price change holding income ($I$) constant, or utility ($U$) constant. Draw same by taking two prices fixed for each situation. 

My guess would be that $\Delta B$, the amount of Bitcoins introduced in the economy in a given year (which you can get from the value of Bitcoin and characteristics of Bitcoin algorithm) and $\Delta S$ (same for dollars, supposingly given by the Fed) should verify $B/S = \Delta B / \Delta S$, or people would decide to keep their liquidities in the currency that is less eased to avoid depreciation. 

Perfectly inelastic demand means the consumer has no choice about buying the product or not: for some reason, he has to buy it. This means that consumer surplus is steady at 0: the consumer never pays less than he would be ready to pay, he always pays what he is asked to. According to your (wrong) graph, the quantity reached would be at the intersection of WP and Supply. While this is true for producers, it is not for consumers: the supply curve should be bent to follow WP when crossing it. You are right about producer surplus, which means we get a total surplus of $-A$, and a consumer surplus of $0$. There are no gains from trade and consumers do not benefit from trade. 

Using those, and with two assumptions (that are induced by a Cobb-Douglas, but far less restrictive): 

First, let's look at the difference nation-wide between income and domestic product. National income $Y = GDP –$ capital depreciation $+$ net foreign factor income $NDP = GDP$ $–$ capital depreciation Note the difference between the two is the net foreign factor income, that is, the difference between what firms from the country earn outside the country and foreign firms earn in the country. Depending on your definition of sector $NDP$, you need to add to that net foreign income a "net outsider income", i.e. what firms from other sectors earn in the agricultural sector. Also, the $NDP$ gives you an average of gross earnings for all players in the agricultural sector, that is, including the incomes of anyone considered a member of the sector. Splitting $NDP$ among sectors is something that is hard to do (does the driver that drives the corn from the producer to the retailer count as service sector? Agricultural sector? Retail sector? What if that driver is actually the farmer? The retailer? ), so the links between average income and $NDP$ for a sector might be a little convoluted... 

Strong Nash equilibrium is different from core mainly because of communication. In a Strong Nash, unlimited private communication is allowed. The core is a concept that is linked to Coalition-proof Nash equilibrium rather than Strong Nash. People can freely communicate but cannot make binding commitment before deciding. In some games, both happen to be the same, but in generality, the core is a concept derived from Coalition-proof Nash equilibrium rather than from Strong Nash Equilibrium. 

Expected utility theory is based on valuing expectations. There is more to that than just uncertainty. First, a risky investment is different from an uncertain investment. Risk is usually defined as future events occurring only with a measurable probability, while uncertainty is called upon when the likelihood of future events is indefinite or incalculable, but only estimated in itself (it's like a risk on risk). What I'm saying here is actually agreed upon by the author. Note that the first definition of expected utility models did not include any other considerations that risk. Part of the "risk premium" is... a risk premium, rather than an uncertainty premium, and shouldn't be modified by a better understanding of uncertainty. Another part of the risk premium is the fact that it is usually set outside the micro-economic model, usually at the moment of raising capital. No due diligence can give an investor an "inside" view of the model, and so there will always be a cost of borrowing money, which is to be taken into account in a risk premium for any project that requires money over time. What the article discusses seems more to me as a motivation to decrease the impact of uncertainty, and so the risk premium, rather than change the way we look at it. Being able to translate uncertainty into risk is great, but won't make risk itself disappear. For some projects so, it is likely to increase the risk premium as risks taken are better quantified, as uncertainty premium is meant to cover hidden/ unknown risk premium only on average.
