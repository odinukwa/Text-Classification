Let $C$ be a smooth projective connected complex curve of genus $\geq 2$. Let me show that $C^{(d)}$ is of general type if $1\leq d\leq g-1$. Equivalently, one needs to show that the image $W_d$ of $C^{(d)}$ in the jacobian $J(C)$ is of general type, because $C^{(d)}\to W_d$ is birational. If $W_d$ were not of general type, then, by [Ueno, Classification of algebraic varieties I, Theorem 3.10], there would be a non-trivial abelian variety $A\subset J(C)$ such that $W_d$ is stable by translation by $A$ (this is the argument in MP's comment above). But then, $W_{g-1}$ would also be stable by translation by $A$. Now choose a point $x$ outside of $W_{g-1}$ and consider the orbit $A.x$ : it is a positive-dimensional variety avoiding $W_{g-1}$. This is a contradiction because $W_{g-1}$ is an ample divisor: the theta divisor. 

Since global sections of a coherent sheaf in Zariski or étale cohomology coincide, your question is really about Zariski cohomology of coherent (locally free) sheaves. It has a negative answer, although it is not too easy to find a counterexample. I explain below one counter-example. The variety involved is a particular case of the ribbons studied here : $URL$ . Using the material of this paper, you should be able to produce many more examples. Let $k$ be a field, and $X\subset\mathbb{P}^2_k$ be the double conic defined by $(xy+z^2)^2=0$. Let $X_0$ be the reduction of $X$: it is the smooth conic defined by $xy+z^2=0$. It is easy to compute $H^0(X_0, \mathcal{O})=H^0(X, \mathcal{O})=k$, $H^1(X_0, \mathcal{O})=0$ and $H^1(X,\mathcal{O})\neq 0$. Fix a nontrivial element $e\in H^1(X,\mathcal{O})$. Let $0\to\mathcal{O}_X\to\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{O}_X\to 0$ be the associated extension: it is a rank $2$ vector bundle on $X$. In the associated long exact sequence $0\to H^0(X,\mathcal{O})\to H^0(X,\mathcal{F})\to H^0(X,\mathcal{O})\to H^1(X,\mathcal{O})$, the image of $1$ in $H^1(X,\mathcal{O})$ is the extension class $e$, so that $H^0(X,\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $1$. On the other hand the restriction $0\to\mathcal{O}_{X_0}\to i^*\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{O}_{X_0}\to 0$ has to split because $H^1(X_0, \mathcal{O})=0$. As a consequence, $H^0(X_0,i^*\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $2$. For dimension reasons, $H^0(X,\mathcal{F})\to H^0(X_0,i^*\mathcal{F})$ cannot be surjective. 

Here are two examples. The moduli space of dimension $g$ principally polarized abelian varieties $A_g$ contains complete codimension $g$ subvarieties in any positive characteristic $p$ (for instance, the locus of abelian varieties with no nontrivial $p$-torsion points), but not in characteristic $0$ (by Keel and Sadun arXiv:math/0204229). The other example is also a resul of Keel (arXiv:math/9901149). It states that a nef and big line bundle $L$ on a projective variety over a field of positive characteristic is semi-ample if and only if its restriction to the exceptional locus (i.e. the union of subvarieties $Z$ such that $L|_Z$ is not big) is semi-ample. This criterion is not true in characteristic $0$. 

Suppose that the secant variety of your curve is a surface $S$. This implies that $S$ is covered by lines in such a way that there is a $1$-dimensional family of such lines through every general point of $S$. Now let $P$ be a general smooth point on $S$. The lines contained in $S$ through $P$ are necessarily included in the plane $T_P S$. Since there is a $1$-dimensional family of such lines, these are exactly the lines in $T_P S$ through $P$. These lines cover $T_P S$ so that $T_P S\subset S$. Since the dimensions agree, and by irreducibility of $S$, $T_P S=S$. This shows that the curve is included in the plane $T_P S$, hence degenerate. 

It is not true : for instance, $X$ and $X'$ might be two non-isomorphic $G$-torsors on the same $S$-scheme $T$. Here is a precise example. Consider $S=T=Spec(\mathbb{R})$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, let $X=Spec(\mathbb{C})$ and $X'=Spec(\mathbb{R})\cup Spec(\mathbb{R})$ viewed as $S$-schemes, and let $G$ act on $X$ and $X'$ respectively by complex conjugation and by exchanging the connected components. Both actions admit $Spec(\mathbb{R})$ as a geometric quotient. But an isomorphism between these quotients obviously doesn't lift to an equivariant morphism between $X$ and $X'$. Here is another example : take $S=Spec(\mathbb{C})$, $G=\mathbb{G}_m$, $T=\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$. Let $X$ (resp. $X'$) be the total space of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(1)$) on $T$ minus the zero-section, with the natural $G$-action. Both actions admit $T$ as a geometric quotient, but there is no equivariant morphism between $X$ and $X'$ lifting identity. 

It is true if $Y$ is normal. Let me explain why. I will say that a variety has the Chevalley-Kleiman (CK) property if every finite subset is contained in an affine open. By Corollary 48 of Kollar's "Quotients by finite equivalence relations" arXiv:0812.3608, if $f:X\to Y$ is finite and surjective, then if $X$ has the CK property, $Y$ has it too. Now, it is clear that a quasi-projective variety has the CK property, and a normal variety with the CK property is quasi-projective by Corollary 2 of "Quasi-projectivity of normal varieties" arXiv:1112.0975. Putting this together, we see that if $f:X\to Y$ is a finite surjective map of varieties with $X$ quasi-projective and $Y$ normal, then $Y$ is quasi-projective. 

Moreover, the hypothesis that $G$ is smooth may be removed as follows. First, we deal with the case where $X$ is separated and reduced. In this case, the arguments given by Anton in the question still work : the graphs of the action and of the projection are closed subschemes of $G\times X\times X$ isomorphic to $G\times X$ that coincide on an open dense subset $U$. Since $G\times X$ has no embedded point ($X$ is reduced and $G$ homogeneous), these two graphs need to coincide with the schematic closure of $U$ in $G\times X\times X$ and are thus equal. Then we deal with the general case ($G$ connected, $X$ reduced) in the following way. Applying the result when the group is smooth connected and the space is reduced to $G^{red}$ acting on $X$ shows that $G^{red}$ acts trivially on $X$. In particular, $G^{red}$ stabilizes every affine open subset of $X$ ; this implies that $G$ also stabilizes every affine open subset of $X$. Applying the result when the group is connected and the space is separated and reduced to $G$ acting on any affine open subset of $X$ shows that $G$ acts trivially on any open subset of $X$, hence on $X$. 

The answer to your question is positive. Let $X$ be an integral projective variety of dimension $n\geq 2$ (over an algebraically closed field) and $V\subset X$ a subvariety of codimension $\geq 2$. Let $A$ be ample on $X$ : up to replacing $A$ by a multiple, we may assume that $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ and $A=\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. Let $\mathcal{H}_e$ be the projective space of degree $e$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^N$, $\mathcal{F}_e^{igr}(X)\subset\mathcal{H}_e$ the subset consisting of hypersurfaces whose intersections with $X$ are not irreducible generically reduced of codimension $1$ in $X$, and $\mathcal{G}_e(V)\subset\mathcal{H}_e$ the subset consisting of hypersurfaces containing $V$. The exact sequence $0\to\mathcal{I}_V(e)\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^N}(e)\to\mathcal{O}_V(e)\to 0$ shows that, when $ e\gg 0$, the codimension of $\mathcal{G}_e(V)$ in $\mathcal{H}_e$ is a polynomial of degree $\leq n-2$ in $e$ (the Hilbert polynomial of $V$). On the other hand, Théorème 0.4 of arXiv:0911.1118 shows that, when $e\geq 2$, the codimension of $\mathcal{F}_e^{igr}(X)$ in $\mathcal{H}_e$ is $\geq \binom{e+n-1}{n-1}-n$, that is at least a polynomial of degree $n-1$ in $e$. As a consequence, if $e \gg 0$, $\mathcal{G}_e(V)$ is not included in $\mathcal{F}_e^{igr}(X)$. A hypersurface in $\mathcal{G}_e(V)$ but not in $\mathcal{F}_e^{igr}(X)$ induces on $X$ the divisor you are looking for. Note that if $X$ is moreover $S_2$ (for instance, normal), then this divisor is itself integral. 

It has been conjectured by Euler that this equation has no solutions in positive integers when $n\geq 4$. When $n=4$, this was disproved by Elkies in the paper [Elkies, On A4+B4+C4=D4] in a very strong way: he proves that the rational points of this K3 surface are dense in the real points for the euclidean topology. When $n\geq 5$ is odd, your surface contains lines, for instance the line $Z-T=X+Y=0$. Consequently, it has infinitely many rational points. Of course, this does not disprove Euler's conjecture, that required positive integers. 

Let $f:X\to Y$ be a finite surjective map of degree $d$ between smooth projective varieties of dimension $n$. Then $f$ is flat (apply EGA IV 2 Prop 6.1.5), so Example 1.7.4 of Fulton's Intersection Theory shows that $f_{\ast}\circ f^{\ast}$ is multiplication by $d$ on the Chow groups $CH^*(Y)$. Hence the kernel of $f^{\ast}$ on $CH^{\ast}(Y)$ is of $d$-torsion. It remains true that $f_{\ast}\circ f^{\ast}$ is multiplication by $d$ on the integral cohomology of $Y$, hence that the kernel of $f^{\ast}$ on $H^{\ast}(Y,\mathbb{Z})$ is of $d$-torsion. It may be seen as follows. Recall that if $\alpha\in H^{k}(Y)$ and $\beta\in H^{k}(X)$, their Poincaré-dual classes are $\alpha\cap [Y]\in H_{n-k}(Y)$ and $\beta\cap [X]\in H_{n-k}(X)$ and that $f_*:H^{k}(X)\to H^{k}(Y)$ is defined to be the push-forward at the level of Poincaré-dual classes. Combining the projection formula $f_{\ast}(f^{\ast}\alpha\cap[X])=\alpha\cap f_{\ast}[X]$ and the fact that $f_{\ast}[X]=d[Y]$ because $f$ is a degree $d$ map, we get the formula $f_{\ast}\circ f^{\ast}(\alpha)= d\alpha$ we wanted to prove. This shows that $f^{\ast}$ is injective on Chow groups modulo torsion, on integral cohomology modulo torsion, on rational cohomology, on cohomology with complex coefficients... This last point moreover implies that $f^{\ast}$ is injective on the pieces $H^{p,q}(Y)$ of the Hodge decomposition. However, $f^{\ast}$ need not be injective on the integral cohomology. If $Y$ is an Enriques surface and $X$ is its universal cover (a K3 surface), $H^2(Y,\mathbb{Z})_{tors}=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})$ has no torsion so that $f^{\ast}$ is not injective on $H^2$. Torsion in cohomology is not the only reason why $f^{\ast}$ may fail to be injective on $CH^{\ast}(Y)$. For example, let $X$ be an elliptic curve. Suppose that its $2$-torsion is generated by $\sigma$ and $\tau$, and let $Y=X/\sigma$. We still denote by $\tau$ the image of $\tau$ in $Y$. Then, working in $CH^1=Pic$, we get $f^*(\tau-0)=\tau-0+\tau+\sigma-0-\sigma=2\tau-2.0=0$, so that $f^{\ast}$ is not injective on $CH^1$. When dealing with $0$-cycles, it is possible to apply the theorem of Roitman. For example, if $H^1(Y,\mathbb{C})=0$, $f^*$ is injective on $CH_0$. Indeed, the Albanese variety of $Y$ is then trivial, and, by Roitman, $CH_0$ has no torsion. 

The paper "Stability of genus five canonical curves " by Fedorchuk and Smyth (arXiv:1302.4804) contains a detailed analysis of the (semi-)stability of nets of quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^4$, and completely describes the GIT quotient. In particular, they show that the (semi-)stability of a net cannot be read off the (semi-)stability of the disriminant locus (see for instance Remark 3.21). [Fedorchuk and Smyth's motivation is to construct a birational model of $\overline{M}_5$, and to give a modular interpretation of it. This work is part of the general idea to try to run explicitely the MMP for moduli spaces of curves.] 

This locus is indeed open. I will explain why using Kollar's "Hulls and Husks" (arXiv:0805.0576). More generally, this article studies in great detail when taking the double dual commutes with base change. First, we may restrict to the open locus of $T$ where $F_t$ is torsion-free (because reflexive sheaves are torsion-free). Then, we choose an ample line bundle $H$ on $X$, and we compute the Hilbert polynomials relatively to $H$. The Hilbert polynomial $P(F_t)$ of $F_t$ is constant by flatness. From the exact sequence $0\to F_t\to F^{\vee\vee}_t\to F^{\vee\vee}_t/F_t\to 0$, we see that $F_t$ is reflexive exactly when $P(F^{\vee\vee}_t)=P(F_t)$, i.e. exactly when $P(F^{\vee\vee}_t)$ takes its minimal value. But the polynomial $P(F^{\vee\vee}_t)$ is constructible and upper semicontinuous by Proposition 28 (3) of Hulls ans Husks. This proves that this locus is open. 

What follows does not answer your precise question, but is very related to it and may be of interest to you. I consider the case where $G$ is finite, but not necessarily abelian. Then there are several rings attached to $G$, whose spectrum you might want to consider. The first one is the ring $R(G)$ of virtual characters of $G$ (or, equivalently, the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional complex representations of $G$). When $G$ is abelian, it is exactly the group ring of the dual group $\hat{G}$. This group is defined in [Serre: représentations linéaires des groupes finis, 9.1] and its spectrum is studied in [loc. cit., 11.4], where it is shown to be connected. The other one is the ring $Burn(G)$ that is the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite $G$-sets. In [Bayer-Fluckiger, Parimala, Serre: Hasse principle for G-trace forms, 4.2] (see also references therein), you will find the precise definition, the statement that the spectrum of $Burn(G)$ is connected if and only if $G$ is solvable, and a very nice example of application of $Burn(G)$. 

I believe that this statement is not true. Take $Y=Spec(k[t]/t^2)$ and $X=\mathbb{P}^1_Y$. On $X$, extensions of $\mathcal{O}$ by $\mathcal{O}(-2)$ are parametrized by : $$Ext^1_X(\mathcal{O},\mathcal{O}(-2))=H^1(X,\mathcal{O}(-2))=H^0(X,\mathcal{O})^{\vee}\simeq k[t]/t^2,$$ as a $k[t]/t^2$-module. Let $0\to\mathcal{O}(-2)\to E\to\mathcal{O}\to 0$ be the extension corresponding to $t\in k[t]/t^2$. By construction, the map $H^0(X,\mathcal{O})\to H^1(X,\mathcal{O}(-2))$ in the long exact sequence associated to the above short exact sequence is multiplication by $t$. It follows that $H^0(X,E)$, that is the kernel of this map, is necessarily $(t)\subset k[t]/t^2$. Hence it is isomorphic to $k[t]/t$ as a $k[t]/t^2$-module and it is not free. As $f_*E=H^0(X,E)$ because $Y$ is affine, and $E$ is flat over $Y$ because it is a vector bundle on $X$ that is flat over $Y$, this is a counter-example to the statement. 

The answer to your question is negative. To discuss it, let me make in what follows the additional assumption that the associated projective variety $Y\subset\mathbb{P}^3_{\mathbb{R}}$ is smooth, and let me denote by $d$ the degree of $f$. Then, the existence of $g$ implies that $Y_{\mathbb{C}}$ is a unirational complex variety. This cannot happen if $d\geq 4$ because $Y_{\mathbb{C}}$ carries a non-trivial $2$-differential form. When $d\geq 5$, it is expected (but unknown and difficult), that the rational points cannot be dense (even for the Zariski topology). Thus conjecturally, you cannot hope for a counter-example if $d\geq 5$. On the other hand, when $d=4$, $Y$ is a K3 surface, and it is really possible that the rational points are dense in the real points (for the Zariski topology or even, as you ask, for the euclidean topology). A concrete example is given in [Elkies, On $A^4+B^4+C^4=D^4$], showing that a counterexample to your question is given by $u^4+v^4+z^4-1$. Finally, let me indicate that when $d=3$ (and if we insist, in your question, that the whole of $Y$ is smooth), the question has a positive answer, going back to [Segre, A note on arithmetical properties of cubic surfaces] : a cubic surface that has a rational point is unirational. This is also the case, and easy, if $d=2$ or $1$. 

In Theorem 6 of the following paper : $URL$ building on Van Lujik's work, François Charles explains a (theoretical) algorithm that computes the rank of a K3 surface $X$ defined over a number field. This algorithm terminates conjecturally, for instance if $X\times X$ satisfies the Hodge conjecture. The main new feature of this article, that allows him to obtain an algorithm, is that the discrepancy between the rank of $X$ and the rank of the reduction of $X$ at a typical prime may be read off the algebra of endomorphisms of the transcendental lattice of $X$. 

I think this is a consequence of (variants of) Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. Let me explain why. Suppose that $C$ is a geometrically integral curve defined over a number field $K$. Let $K'/K$ be a normal finite extension. We will show that infinitely many points of $C$ are defined over a field disjoint from $K'$. Since both the hypotheses and the conclusion are birational invariants, we may suppose that $C$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{A}_K^2$ (take an affine open of $C$, embed it in $\mathbb{A}^N$ for some $N$ and take a generic projection to $\mathbb{A}^2$). Choose a generic projection $p:C\to\mathbb{A}^1_K$. The curve $C$ is described by an equation $F(t,x)=0$, where $t$ is the coordinate of $\mathbb{A}^1_K$, and $F$ is an irreducible polynomial. Now, since $C$ is geometrically integral, $F_{K'}$ is still irreducible. By [Serre, Topics in Galois theory, Proposition 3.3.1], $x\mapsto F_{K'}(\lambda',x)$ is irreducible for every $\lambda'\in K'$ outside of a thin set. Hence, by [Serre, Topics in Galois theory, Proposition 3.2.1], $x\mapsto F_{K'}(\lambda,x)$ is irreducible for every $\lambda\in K$ outside of a thin set. Since $K$ is Hilbertian, this holds for infinitely many $\lambda\in K$. Let us fix such a $\lambda$. We denote by $q$ and $q'$, the points of $\mathbb{A}^1_K$ and $\mathbb{A}^1_{K'}$ with coordinate $\lambda$. By choice of $\lambda$, $x\mapsto F_{K'}(\lambda,x)$ hence also $x\mapsto F(\lambda,x)$ are irreducible polynomials. Hence $p_{K'}^{-1}(q')\subset C_{K'}$ (resp. $p^{-1}(q)\subset C$) consists of a unique (reduced) point $p'\in C_{K'}$ (resp. $p\in C$). Let $L$ and $L'$ be the residual fields of $p$ and $p'$. By construction, $p'=p\times_{q} q'$ so that $L'=L\otimes_K K'$. This implies that $L$ is disjoint from $K'$. 

Let me explain why this statement cannot be true in general. I will give a counterexample where $X$ is a complex K3 surface. By a result of [Beauville and Voisin, On the Chow ring of a K3 surface], it is possible to find a point $y\in X$ such that whenever $C_1$, $C_2$ are curves on $X$, $C_1\cap C_2$ is proportional to $y$ in $CH_0(X)$. Now, I will construct $x_0, x_1,\dots...$ inductively. Suppose that $x_0,\dots,x_i$ have been constructed. Then choose $x_{i+1}$ such that it is independent of $y,x_0,\dots,x_i$ in $CH_0(X)$. To prove that such a point exists necessarily, let me suppose for contradiction that it does not exist : for every $z\in X$, a nonzero multiple of $z$ is in the subgroup of $CH_0(X)$ generated by $y,x_0,\dots,x_i$. Choose a curve $C$ through $y,x_0,\dots,x_i$. Our hypothesis is that every $z\in X$ has a nonzero multiple in the image of $Pic(C)\to CH_0(X)$. Since $Pic^0(C)$ is divisible and $CH_0^0(X)$ has no torsion by a theorem of Roitman [The torsion of the group of 0-cycles modulo rational equivalence], this implies that $Pic^0(C)\to CH_0^0(X)$ is surjective. This contradicts a theorem of Mumford [Rational equivalence of $0$-cycles on surfaces] stating that $CH_0^0(X)$ is infinite-dimensional. Now, if $C_1, C_2$ are two curves on $X$, their intersection is a multiple of $y$ in $CH_0(X)$, and cannot be supported on the $x_i$ because $y$ and the $x_i$ have been chosen independent in $CH_0(X)$.
