Although this may seem contradictory, there are ways to make this make sense. For instance, suppose, unknown to you, you had been hooked into a virtual reality simulation that exactly duplicates the world as you now know it. While in that simulated world, you interact (virtually) with other human beings who are also real beings hooked into the same simulation. In that case, if one of them declared "this is all a fake," she could be a real person in a fake world. Classically speaking, both Plato and Descartes, as well as many other idealists, believed that the mind is more real than the body. If we think of a human being primarily as their mind, then it is possible the human (the mind) is real in a fake world, for instance, when dreaming. Of course, two minds don't generally share the same dream, but if you were the dream character, being addressed by (for example) a lucid dreamer, then a real person could be telling you real information about a fake world. It could also be that the person is not real, but the idea is. In the same scenario, except reversed, you might be the real person dreaming, and the dream character, although unreal, is telling you real information about the fake world you seem to be inhabiting. 

Plato. His theory of "Forms," ideal, perfect, abstract conceptual entities, continues to have a currency among mathematicians it has largely lost elsewhere, and is also of continuing interest to engineers and designers. 

It is true that in the argument I [think], therefore I am, any action could replace "think" without changing the structure. However, Descartes' specific claim is that thinking is the one thing he has direct irrefutable proof via personal experience of doing. In terms of the overall structure of The Meditations he first doubts everything that could possibly be false, he then claims that the reality that he thinks is irrefutable (even if he is utterly mistaken about who is the entity doing the thinking), and he proceeds from that premise to the conclusion that he exists. "I" is just a marker for whatever entity is thinking. Descartes claims (at this point) no knowledge about any characteristics of "I" other than the fact that it is thinking. You might rephrase his argument as Thought is happening, therefore something that can be called "I" is doing that thinking. 

It won't look like a tautology, however, until you fill in the actual statements. (As far as assigning truth values, those go with the variables within the premises.) Example: 

All philosophical categories have fuzzy boundaries, and existentialism, absurdism and nihilism more than most, since those tend to be labels imposed on people who are intrinsically opposed to labels. Nonetheless, I think you are looking in the right places. A lot of the distinction comes from how people react to the idea that life has no intrinsic meaning. We associate the existentialism of a Sartre or De Beauvoir with the idea that we create our own meaning, and the absurdism of a Camus with the idea that we carry on in spite of the meaningless of everything. Nihilism is associated with active antagonism to belief, but it is particularly difficult to define, since even Nietzsche, who is most closely associated with the idea, usually discussed it critically, rather than affirmingly. Out of the three, you are probably closest to absurdism, which does NOT typically entail taking on an artificial belief, as you indictated --you may have it confused with Discordianism. Given your sense of comfort with the meaningless of life, however, your outlook actually reminds me most of philosophical Buddhism, which teaches that life is illusionary, and that letting go of attachments is the best path. (Conversely, if you believe that we can and should connect with some deeper level of reality beneath the illusion that is life, then you are perhaps a Platonist.) 

Former President Jimmy Carter famously referred to the passage when asked about his moral character, by saying he had "lusted in his heart." Generally, however, this is viewed as part of the central Christian doctrine that no human being is free of sin, rather than as an achievable goal. 

Every formal question presupposes a domain of discourse from which valid answers can be drawn. Whether or not it is made explicit, a question like this appears to be seeking a mathematical answer. Giving a color-based answer violates the implied domain of discourse, and suggests that the person answering has either accidentally or deliberately misinterpreted the question. Of course, there are situations where "outside the box" thinking is required, or desirable. In such a case the implied domain of discourse is the "box" and ignoring it is "thinking outside of it." Formal questions, however, restrict the realm of possible answers by necessity. In a formal system, every recognized condition must be well-defined within that system. That cannot be guaranteed without a restricted domain. 

I would personally recommend five books of foundational philosophy. All of them are hugely influential, relatively brief, aimed at a general audience, and not hard to read (if you find a good translation!). One is Middle Eastern (from the Bible), one is Asian, one are European, and the last two are ancient Greek. I have listed them in rough order of difficulty. 

The reason science is taken seriously, within and outside philosophy, is that it has been demonstrably effective in creating a wide, usable and internally connected body of practical and theoretical knowledge. Therefore both its existence and its seeming effectiveness become part of the facts about the world that any other system of thought must account for. While there have been philosophical movements that have attempted to exclude from consideration anything that cannot be logically or rigorously proven, this has largely been acknowledged as unworkable in practice. Therefore, your question, properly speaking, is not about philosophy in general, but a particular (and largely discredited) branch of philosophy. 

This is a more difficult question than it first appears. Appealing to majority opinion is considered an illegitimate form of justification for a claim. Yet, in the StackExchange environment, we often take the highest-rated answer as definitive. I'd say the major difference is that the high-rating is not intended to be taken as definitive --it is just there to help you find the best answers. Those answers, however, still need to be strong in themselves --that is, well argued and/or well supported with citations, references, justifications, etcetera. However, no claim is made that the answer becomes right or righter simply because of votes. It may be a constant temptation to conflate rightness and popularity --but that is a constant temptation anywhere, that's why the fallacy exists in the first place. If anything, I'd say that consistent participation in SE could even reduce incidences of the fallacy, since it encourages the crafting of well-formed answers and also the critical examination and independent evaluation of other people's answers. (For whatever reason, SE seems to have accomplished these last two goals better than some of its rivals.) 

Although this isn't a direct answer to your question, it's worth noting that several important philosophers have made optical illusions a central topic of inquiry. For Plato in the Republic, optical illusions are a metaphor for the deceptive nature of what we naively accept as reality. For Descartes in the Meditations, optical illusions are a spur towards seeking a foundation for knowledge outside the realm of sensory data. In addition the well-known optical illusion called the duckrabbit is famously associated with Wittgenstein through his discussion of it in the Investigations, (although whether it truly counts as an optical illusion is unclear). I'm not expert enough on Wittgenstein to decisively state what he drew from the example, but you may find it worth your time to pursue. 

Logic is rooted in the claim that consistently useful generalizations can be made about an argument based solely on the form, independent of content. It's a process of abstraction, very similar to the way numbers are an abstraction of our experience of quantity. It's possible to study logic as a purely abstract, mathematical exercise, but if you want to view it as the science of argument, you can't escape that claim. Thinkers such as Tarski, and many others, have done their best to establish firm foundations for logic at a fundamental level, but you still essentially have to accept as a given that formal concepts such as logical truth and validity do reliably map back to the real world (much the same is true in mathematics). The main issue is that logic is our chief system for constructing proofs --we cannot use it to justify itself, or its own axioms. 

Any time you look at philosophical views on what is real, you'll find Plato somewhere in the mix. Arguably, in his cosmology, there are both Real and unreal things in the world, but his classification of which is which is less arbitrary than yours at least seems to be. For Plato, things like Truth, Beauty and Goodness are Real; lies, ugliness and evil are illusions. Or, to put it another way, all and only Good things are Real. Your own perspective seems closer to one hinted at by contemporary philosopher Nick Bostrom in his "simulation" theory, that postulates we all exist inside a computer simulated world. In a deliberately simulated world, some parts, which will be interacted with, might be "real" (at least by the standards of the simulation) meaning they are actually simulated. Others may just appear to exist, to make the simulation appear larger than it is. Similarly some people in such a world might be fully simulated, others might be "avatars", directly controlled by the simulators, and others might be "zombies" --background figures with no actual consciousness or agency. In the simulated world, the reason for this ontological parsimony is clear: It is a savings on resources to fake up the parts of the simulation that receive the most scrutiny more convincingly than others. If it would take, as seems reasonable, a universe's worth of resources to actually simulate an entire universe, then it might be a necessity for a simulation to appear more complex than it actually is, at least if it is being simulated in a universe like the one being simulated. If, on the other hand, the world is in the mind of God, who presumably has infinite resources, then why would God cheat? As Descartes concluded in his Meditations, we must assume a good and honest God who is not deceiving us, because without such an assumption, we can never actually know anything. 

That is a terrible --although also terribly common --definition of humanism, which should more properly be defined as a concern with the nature, capacity and potential of humanity, and the development and promotion of the same. I would venture that White is using it more in this sense. The common definition of humanism should more correctly be called secular humanism. Without the modifier it is historically incorrect, given that the original humanists were mainly practicing Christians. 

In summary, the tension you experience between faith and science is not unique to modern times. As such, it has been addressed extensively in the philosophical tradition. You may not find any of these above viewpoints compelling, but hopefully you can see how people can be familiar with a scientific viewpoint and still find faith a necessity. (I apologize for giving such a sketchy gloss on each philosopher's position, but your question was too broad to go into any great detail on any given response.) 

How to live a meaningful life in a world where the received wisdom of religion and culture is no longer taken for granted is one of the defining problems of the modern age, and the central question of the philosophy called "existentialism." In fact, however, people have been wrestling with it since antiquity. The Biblical book of Ecclesiastes is basically an extended meditation on the same problem (you might find it useful, it's a quick and easy read, and doesn't really assume any particular religious orthodoxy). Camus and Ecclesiastes arguably come to similar conclusions, that you just solider on, living as best you can, without any particular rational justification. But other thinkers have offered less bleak solutions. Camus' contemporary Sartre counseled imposing your own will and sense of values upon the world, giving it your meaning, rather than seeking meaning from within it. A very different approach comes from Plato, who teaches us that the meaninglessness and absurdity of the world we live in is a signal that there is another, deeper and more real level of existence that we can and must seek out, rather than aligning ourselves with the absurdities of superficial reality. A similar approach is advocated by existentialist predecessor Kierkegaard, who advocated direct communion with the divine, unmediated by the rules and restrictions of religion, as the only antidote to the drab meaninglessness of everyday life. Finally, we might bring all these together, and claim that being a good person, and doing good in the world is intrinsically meaningful at a deep level, regardless of the realness or rationality of the context, and regardless of the results.
