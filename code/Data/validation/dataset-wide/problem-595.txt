I'm struggling to think of any more options. The only other thing I could think of is that if you do end up with an imperfect chainline, despite your every effort, then a 3/32" chain will be more forgiving than a 1/8" chain. 3/32" chains are designed to be able to traverse cassettes so have a little more flexibility in them. 

There are studies that link cycling to Erectile Dysfunction. A quick Google will point you toward further reading. I'm afraid I don't know what the link is (or indeed whether there is a link) between ED and sperm count. The link between cycling an ED is because of pressure exerted on parts of your body while riding. You therefore won't find it surprising to learn that people will suggest one saddle design over another, with this in mind. How much substance there is in any of this......it's all subjective. I think that, in general, though, the health benefits of cycling (helping to prevent e.g. heart disease) are considered to outweigh the risks. ED, for example, is in most cases temporary and reversible. 

I'm speaking very generally here, but sitting straight up can be comfortable for quite short periods. Probably the most upright are sit-up-and-beg bikes, and if you go over to Holland you'll see 70- and 80-year-olds riding them. The downside is that they're not the fastest bikes around. At the other end of the scale, take a look at professional road racers. These guys are as close as possible flat down to the bike. Efficient, but mightily uncomfortable. The reality for the rest of us is that something in between is the most comfortable, but our geometries all tend to be different so different styles suit different people. I think the good thing is that, based on what you say about distance, speed, terrain, climbing, load etc., your requirements aren't very demanding, so you'll have plenty of choice of styles so you should really be able to find a bike that is comfortable for you. (This also opens up the second-hand market, if you wish.) I've ridden in London and I assume NYC is similar - be prepared to get a couple of decent locks, and make sure the bike you get will be able to carry them around somehow. 

If it helps any, there are also several different styles of pedal - literally a few tens by the looks of things - which can be used with SPD cleats. For example: 

I think which, if any, of these you choose is ultimately going to be down to how you see yourself using your bike going forward. Are you wanting to get faster? ride longer? go touring? compete? etc. etc. etc. Likewise you could look at every suggestion and decide that none of them is worth it. 

Okay, so this is an aluminium-framed Sora road bike, with a carbon fork, from a European chain store, as shown here? First of all, there should be no problem doing a 200km ride on that type of bike, its what its made for. And, you should be fine to do several of these rides in close succession. The bike doesn't have the greatest drivetrain, but for the rides you're talking about, it should be acceptable. So, other than generally making sure the bike is roadworthy, no special preparation is required. You seem to be asserting that a larger frame will be more comfortable than a smaller frame. I'm not sure where you got that from, but it isn't necessarily true. The comfortable frame is the one that fits. That said, this bike looks like a compact frame so there's probably quite a large range where the frame would be considered an "acceptable" fit. For road riding, 25mm is a perfectly reasonable tyre width. Try them out. If you think you feel too much of the road when you ride, a wider tyre will give you more of a cushion, but you need to make sure that the rims can take a wider tyre, and that you have clearance between the new tyre and your brakes/frame. For your panniers, in your place I would contact Decathlon and ask them whether the bike will accept a rack. But be prepared, there is every likelihood that they will say no, and for sure I'd be very wary of trying to put a rack onto an aluminium frame (or front panniers onto a carbon fork, for that matter). But see what they say. If the bike can have a rack fitted, Decathlon will, I'm sure, be able to recommend something out of their range to you. 

The Sufferfest offer motivational/training videos. Also, Bromley Video in the UK has lots of DVDs, books, videos etc. of all things cycling - grand tours, races, bios, documentaries, dramatisations. Not particularly cheap but the best selection I've seen in a single place, also some of the DVDs are self-produced so I'd imagine are unavailable elsewhere. I think they also have an eBay outlet, you may find some things cheaper on there. 

Strictly speaking, one crankset will have been manufactured for an 8-speed chain, the other will have been manufactured for a 9-speed chain. That is basically the difference between the two. The external widths of an 8-speed chain and a 9-speed chain differ by something like a few tenths of a millimetre. It is arguable whether this amount makes any practical difference to your shifting experience. On the one hand, the bike companies will say that it does. Everything that is part of the chainset will have been manufactured precisely, based upon a certain chain width, and anything different will give you an "imperfect" experience. But then the bike companies also have a vested interest in selling you components. On the other hand, the difference is so small that many people happily run this setup without reporting any ill-effects. Aside from this, I agree entirely with @ShemSeger's answer, but I did think it was important to emphasise to you that there will be a difference, albeit slight, between the two cranksets. 

To start with, an aside. 700x32 describes the physical size of the tyre. 700 is 700mm, which is the diameter of the tyre. That size is very common. 32 is 32mm, and describes the width of the tyre. The wider the tyre, the more rubber in contact with the ground while riding (sometimes you want to have lots of contact, sometimes you don't). Note that due to evolution, tyre sizes are not necessarily expressed in millimetres. For some genres of bicycle (notably mountain bikes), these numbers are expressed in inches, just by convention, a quirk of history. To address your actual question, you say your current tyre is 32mm wide, whereas these calipers are specced for tyres up to 28mm wide. So, just going be what the manufacturer says, the caliper will not fit. Now, you say you have heard someone say that, actually, they will be ok. (And to be honest, this is not at all uncommon in the world of cycling.) So essentially you have to take a punt - do you trust this person, buy the brakes, and run the risk that they don't fit? Or, do you buy some brakes which are specced to your current tyre? The choice is yours... 

You say you like to meet people....so there's your start point. Plan a route where you have a village every four or five miles if possible, and be prepared to stop. When you feel like it, stop for some food or a drink, visit a museum, a church or something. The four or five mile gap is long enough to have a decent ride too, especially if you can pick a scenic, traffic-free route. Don't budget to ride too far each day - if you end up thinking "I've got 20 miles to go and only an hour of daylight left" then that will force you to concentrate on the riding and not on the experience. But by the same token its worth having some places "in reserve" too - if you're going well so have time for a detour. (For my visit over to France I left myself with only about 50km on my last half-day, so visited the museum at Arromanches, plus the one at Pegasus Bridge, before I hopped on the ferry. Great visits the both if you like your history.) You're going to China aren't you? There must be a million things to see there, the opportunity of a lifetime if you ask me. Get yourself onto Google and make a list of things to visit. Incidentally the last thing I would do is to wear earphones etc. unless you're confident you're not going to meet any traffic. Its just a safety thing for me. But to each their own... 

I have come across a web site called Velosolo which offers conversion kits (cogs, spacers, chain tensioners if necessary), especially when going from a geared wheel. Perhaps something on there will suit? That site also has a decent FAQ which might help you identify some of the issues, although by the sounds of things you're already quite clued up. 

Just a matter of priorities, really. If I'm riding out to a meal, then I'll wear clothing appropriate for the meal, and choose my bike accordingly. However if I'm out on a day's ride, I'll dress appropriate for the ride and a spare set of clothes just represents bulk. Do I really want to carry that extra weight? No way. Third scenario, if I am away on a multi-day cycling trip, I will wear cycling gear for the day's riding, but will have a shirt and some trousers for the evening. These have to be as light as possible, as again they represent bulk in my pannier. I suppose I could get away with eating in the hotel in my lycra, it's just possibly a bit whiffy for other diners! 

you say you haven't even begun to race yet. How do you know you'll like it? How do you know you'll be any good? If you go down a carbon route, you're talking about a serious investment which could possibly end up gathering dust in your garage. Frankly, you should consider a steel bike at this stage. When you're losing races because of the weight of the bike, then it's time to upgrade. Be careful with something like bike racing, it will eat up your every last penny if you're not careful. 

Four things: fitness, endorphins, money. Also something a bit more intangible. Keep a check on your weight. If you find it going up because you're cycling less, then there's a good reason to ride more. Who knows? Maybe weight control was the reason you got a bike in the first place? That was certainly the case for me and the knowledge that I am now slim and fit means that I'll keep cycling for good. Two, how good do you feel when you get off the bike after 16 miles? Remember that feeling. Three, I know you guys get cheaper gas than us Europeans, but surely when you fill up your car it must hurt your wallet? These are all motivators for me. I need to get 8 miles from home to the train station each morning, and mix it between car and bike. Started cycling it a few years ago when I did the odd journey through the summer. Became 2-3 days a week, my fitness being the limiting factor. Last couple of years (in the summer) have averaged about 4 days a week. Always used to restrict myself to daylight months (for me this was about April thru August). But this last year I have started night-cycling, even though I've probably only averaged a couple of days a week thru the winter. But I don't beat myself up if I don't fancy the ride, and many times I don't fancy it in heavy rain (largely the "sitting on a train for 90 minutes in soaking clothes" aspect), but mostly I do it because I love it and would prefer to be on the bike than in the car. There's the intangible bit. If you like it more than the car, you'll be motivated to do it.
