Option 3 avoids the communication lag within the realm. Now we have the problem of breakaway gates. The ones running a gate that is physically isolated from other gates within a realm may decide to be big fish in a small pond. If option 3 works with transport too then breakaways would be very difficult. Just have a central armed base that can send troops to any gate, problem solved. Transportation Another way of solving that issue is to have the gates in each realm not map to the same geography. That way if gate 1 and gate 2 in realm A are far apart, they may be near each other in realm B. This would make it hard to be totally isolated. It also means that realms with nearby gates will likely have major roads traveling between them. Travel maps would then have multi realm "shortest path" routes. This is the most interesting option to me. Control Another method that could work is to have a central control that can shut down or operate any gate. No one at a local gate could buck the system because their gate would be shut down until troops are ready to cross it and deal with the situation. I prefer the combination of Communication and Transportation. The Control method simply means that the area of the master control will become a hotbed of intrigue with different factions trying to get enough of their people posted there to control the system. That can be an interesting story but I've read that story way too many times. 

Weapons in games are notoriously oversized. Come on, a great sword that is 1.5 times as tall as its wielder and about half as wide? You wouldn't be able to lift it let alone swing it. So take a note from that and make them smaller. Scale it down so everything but the curving blades covers the hand. That would make the curved blade only extend a few inches past your wrist. This will keep it light enough for a speed/DEX fighter to use. If you make the hilt behind the shield roughly circular then you can flip it from punch/parry/slash mode to stab mode. With the points forward, you may be able to use it to trap an opponent's blade (if the points are long enough). For ambis like me it would be a pretty decent weapon, giving the flexibility to be offense or defense with either or both hands. It would definitely be faster than flipping a short sword so it's blade rests against the underside of my forearm. The main issue is how to carry it when it's not in your hand. 

Once they reach the destination, you have people who have spent generations living on the ship. That ship is home. There might be a few who want to try their hand at living in a gravity well that has that weird and annoying phenomena called weather but most will look at the planet and think of it as a step backward. 

The techs they would need: Astronomy (to know that there's another planet that might have people on it). Beginning radio would do it if they throw enough power into it (cubed root drop off). They might even be able to do this without astronomy if they both have radio and are pumping out enough wattage. That's unlikely however. Why put that much juice into a signal if you don't know there's someone out there to receive it. I just mentioned this because their tech development order does not have to mirror ours completely. It just seem likely that astronomy will occur first. If they learn enough to make parabolic reflectors, they can aim more of the signal at the target and use less power to make the transmission. the parabolic reflectors also allow them to pick up weaker signals. So only one of the pair needs them. That will make communication easier. It will become easier still when they figure out masers. 

If you want to go for laughs, ditch the black powder and use a giant spring behind the back wall. Or, make it an air cannon. All he needs is to drill out a tall and wide vertical shaft with a very heavily weighted plunger with an air tight seal. If he's smart enough to place himself downhill of a large water source, he can turn the hall into a water sluice. This would have the benefit of being self cleaning. There may be too many Saturday morning cartoons in my early years. 

National borders tend to follow obstacles. In most cases, the borders make sense. As was mentioned by Kolbítr, rivers are not usually borders unless the river itself is large enough to be an obstacle. Another way a river can be a border is if the two nations are on relatively good terms. Those cases could happen in your world but I see too many instances of it. The excuses would get rather thin. Any conquering force that travels across a kingdom to seize the fertile land along a river is very likely to put in the extra effort to grab the extra set right across the water. Note that if the river is wide, violent, or has drastically different shore elevations (like a river that runs along the base of a cliff), the different kingdoms might be reduced to shouting insults at each other. The border is more likely to run through the desert than along a river. The only city placement issue that I see is Gothelar (sp? it's hard to read some of the letters) in Morizar. It is unlikely that a city would be placed at the start of a river. For one thing, rivers generally start in mountains and the terrain tends to be too steep for growing food. If it doesn't start in a mountain, it generally starts at a lake or marsh that then drains out the river (I don't see that on the map). There could be a reason to place a city there (religious, resources, political) but that doesn't show up on the map. 

In the Space:1889 RPG, they had liftwood that provided an anti gravity force. It wanted to rise in gravity. IIRC, by flooding the wood with electricity or a special gas (or both) you could increase this effect. I would recommend that any antigravity effect also be limited like this. Have it only effect the device itself. Therefore, it must be attached securely to the ship or it will tear itself free from the ship and fly up until it ran out of juice. This avoids any kind of overlapping field effects. It also means that the crew doesn't have to remain strapped down to prevent them from accidentally launching themselves off the ship when they take a step. 

Everyone else has mentioned scaling issues so I won't cover those. I will instead cover two different issues: Uranium Shortage: There isn't enough fissionable Uranium around to switch completely to nuclear power. There is enough Uranium to run the shelters but not for the entire world to be converted. It would only last for about 10 years. Heck, even without full conversion we are facing a shortage (article). 

Maybe some people get better results for their effort. It might be genetics/bloodline or it might be through expensive supplements that they can take. It could be for both reasons. Those with good bloodlines and who were rich would have much higher levels than ordinary folk. This is common in Chinese novels like you find on Wuxia World. 

For primitive cultures: To make female armies the norm, you have to find some way to make women more expendable than men. Egg Laying (rm -rf slash) is a start but it doesn't go far enough. 1 male can impregnate a large number of females. The female can only gestate the offspring of 1 male. This can be overcome to some extent by having the females experience triggered ovulation with litters. Cats can have kittens from multiple males in the same litter. This only reduces the discrepancy, not eliminate it. Before modern medicine giving birth was very dangerous. Killing off women through other means was just socially suicidal. For advanced cultures: Overpopulation reduces the issue. A good war killing off the women will do more for long term overpopulation elimination than killing off the men. If overpopulation isn't a problem then female armies will work in the short term but would still have long term consequences. Artificial wombs will eliminate all of the above arguments. Then the only issue will be cultural. 

If all you want to do is spread life at the most basic level, you can find bacteria that survive dormancy for extended periods of time. Pack them in golf ball sized spheres that can survive the heat of reentry due to ablation but will then crack upon impact. Then create one or more big cannons/rail guns/gauss cannons and start launching as fast as you can. The rotation of the planet will ensure a good spread that you can maximize by having a few that are aimed off of equatorial perpendicular. If you keep the guns aimed into the galactic plane, you have an OK chance that some of them will hit planets. If you want more precision, you can shotgun the areas near stars (where they will be in x thousand years). 

A star that has a stronger red component should work. As has been mentioned, clouds in the evening or morning are red because only the red light is getting to them. Have red light (from a red star) get to them and they will look red. The sky looks blue because that is the color that our air scatters. As long as the star has enough blue in it's light, the sky will look blue regardless of the color of the star. I don't know if a red star has enough blue output to make the sky look blue but an orange star probably does. The atmosphere just needs to scatter enough blue to make the cloud look red (higher clouds will look more orange than lower ones). Unless someone who knows enough about stars and atmospheric light scattering says that there isn't one, just posit that there is a sweet spot between our yellow Sun and a red star that produces red clouds and blue skies. 

Anything that gets rid of the people would do it. Modern structures aren't meant to survive more than a couple hundred years. Without maintenance, most structures in areas with moisture will be gone or unrecognizable mounds in 300 years. Ironically, the oldest existing structures are likely to be the ones that are still around. Stone buildings that haven't fallen over yet are sturdy. Cement is not a good substitute for stone. Most modern concrete contains enough salt from the sand that the salt crystals will expand and weaken the structure. Concrete with steel reinforcing will actually fall before non-reinforced concrete since any crack that allows moisture to get at the steel will cause the steel to rust and expand. Glass will not rot but will likely be ground into sand or pebbles in 3000 years. Any plastic will become brittle from UV from the sun and as the plasticizer leaks out. It will still be around chemically but will probably be in pieces too small to recognize. 

What JDługosz and others have said plus: Even if you could get the Earth out of the Sun's gravity well (reach escape velocity) without destroying it in the process, the plants will die and then everything will freeze. If you don't make it out before the expanding red giant phase engulfs the Earth, everything on the surface will be crisped and the atmosphere and water will be burned off. Of course, you could drill down into the crust until you reach an area that is kept warm by the core of the planet to build living space. That should stay warm for quite a while. The drilling (getting enough material up to the surface to make enough livable space) and reinforcing it (the deeper you go the more rock is pushing down on your cavern) will take a lot of resources. You have now turned the deep caves into a generation ship that will take at least as much effort to make as actual ships. Then you have to lug 5.972 × 10^24 kg of unusable rock just to deliver a dead planet with people living in it to another star. And, if you have the tech and energy to safely move the planet and provide a source of light and heat for the surface, why not just fix the Sun? That problem should be at least in the same level on the Kardashev Scale. 

If the rebels have to build out of scraps, mount missiles on Jeeps, pickups or SUVs. The vehicles are fast and relatively mobile and may be found or bashed together from multiple damaged vehicles. Also, decent missiles may be easier to build than the precision parts needed for an artillery piece. Also, once the missiles are fired, your vehicle is much lighter for getting away.
