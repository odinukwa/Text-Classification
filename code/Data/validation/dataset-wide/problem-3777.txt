A subset $A$ of $V$ is compact iff it is closed and bounded. $V$ is reflexive. A sequence of Borel probability measures on $V$ converges weakly iff the characteristic functions $V'\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ converge pointwise to a function that is continuous at the origin. 

Notice that $$ y^p-x^p=\prod_{i=0}^{p-1} (y-\omega^i x)\ . $$ Therefore $$ \prod_{i=0}^{p-1} f(x\omega^i)= Res_y (y^p-x^p, f(y))\ . $$ Where $Res_y$ is the resultant of the polynomials in $y$. The above is just a particular case of the so called Poisson product formula. You can then compute the resultant using for instance Sylvester's determinant formula. See the review $URL$ by Cattani and Dickenstein for a nice introduction to resultants and their properties.

I would prefer examples of properties/theorems which are not entirely a consequence of being nuclear. 

One can rehomogenize your problem to deal with the polynomial $f(x,y,z)=z^{m+n}F(x/z,y/z)$. Then what you want is the discriminant of the degree $m+n$ homogeneous polynomial $f$. This is the same as the resultant of $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$. There is a complicated determinant formula for that due to Sylvester and Morley, see this paper. There are quite a few monomials missing in your $F$ so there might be better formulas based on $A$-discriminants and resultants. For that I would look up the book by Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky. Update: I just looked up my copy of "Using Algebraic Geometry" by Cox Little and O'Shea. Exercise 15 of Ch. 3, Sec. 4 explains Sylvester's construction in a more pedagogical way. Ch. 7 should help with the degree determination, although the absence of $c$ in front of the leading monomial $X^m Y^n$ could complicate things. 

For $sl_2$ one has formulas. If $V_n=S^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$, then the multiplicity of the irreducible $V_k$ inside $S^m(V_n)$ is $$ M_{m,n,k}=\left[m,n,\frac{mn-k}{2}\right]-\left[m,n,\frac{mn-k}{2}-1\right] $$ where $[m,n,w]$ is the number of integer partitions of $w$ with at most $n$ parts of length $\le m$. This is the Cayley-Sylvester formula. It was discovered by Cayley in a letter to Sylvester around 1854/1855 but only proved in 1878 by Sylvester (see this article). For simple cases like $S^3(V_n)\simeq S^n(V_3)$ (by Hermite's reciprocity of 1854) one has even more explicit formulas, see Theorem 1.3 in this article. For $sl_n$, as far as I know the state-of-the-art is summarized in this article by Khale and Michałek. 

This is like a Müntz-Százs Theorem for series. See this survey $URL$ Here the usual tool of Gram determinants gives values of the zeta function as matrix entries which does not seem too promising. I would try to project on the subspace corresponding to $k$ a power of a fixed prime $p$. If the projections are not total in the subspace, neither are your $e_n$'s. Answering this type of questions about a specific set being total in $l^2$ can be extremely hard, see: $URL$ 

There has been recent work by Tyler Helmuth which applies Viennot's theory to statistical mechanics and in particular finding new expression for the two point function of Ising-like systems. See his article: $URL$ 

Edit 2: I just found out that the problem I mentioned above has been completely solved! See Proposition 4.50 page 127 in the book by Basu, Pollack and Roy on real algebraic geometry. The connection with classical invariants/covariants of binary forms is not apparent but it is there: their proof is based on subresultants and subdiscriminants which are leading terms of $SL_2$ covariants. 

Edit: Yet another rewriting of the proof of the FFT for $SU(d)$ slash $SL(d)$ in order to eliminate analysis and Haar measures etc. For any $p,q\ge 0$, let $\mathcal{T}_{p,q}$ be the set of arrays $$ T=(T_{a_1,\ldots,a_p,i_1\ldots,i_q})_{a_1,\ldots,a_p,i_1\ldots,i_q\in [d]} $$ of complex numbers. For $g\in GL(d)$ and $T\in\mathcal{T}_{p,q}$ define the new array $gT$ by $$ (gT)_{a_1,\ldots,a_p,i_1\ldots,i_q}=\sum_{b_1,\ldots,b_p,j_1\ldots,j_q\in [d]} T_{j_1,\ldots,j_p,b_1\ldots,b_q} g_{a_1 j_1}\cdots g_{a_p j_p}\ (g^{-1})_{b_1 i_1}\cdots (g^{-1})_{b_q i_q} $$ If $q=0$ then this is well defined for all matrices $g$ and not just invertible ones. We define two maps $\phi:\mathcal{T}_{p,q}\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_{p+q(d-1),0}$ and $\psi:\mathcal{T}_{p+q(d-1),0} \rightarrow\mathcal{T}_{p,q}$ as follows: $$ (\phi(T))_{a_1\ldots a_p, b_{11}\ldots b_{1 (d-1)},\cdots, b_{q 1}\ldots, b_{q (d-1)}}=\sum_{b_1,\ldots,b_q\in [d]} $$ $$ T_{a_1,\ldots,a_p,b_1\ldots,b_q} \tau_{b_1,b_{11}\ldots b_{1 (d-1)}}\cdots \tau_{b_q, b_{q 1}\ldots b_{q (d-1)}} $$ and $$ (\psi(S))_{a_1,\ldots,a_p,i_1\ldots,i_q}=\sum_{j_{11}\ldots j_{1 (d-1)},\cdots, j_{q 1}\ldots, j_{q (d-1)}\in [d]} $$ $$ S_{a_1\ldots a_p, i_1, j_{11}\ldots j_{1 (d-1)},\cdots, i_q, j_{q 1}\ldots, j_{q (d-1)}} \epsilon_{i_1, j_{11}\ldots j_{1 (d-1)}}\cdots \epsilon_{i_q, j_{q 1}\ldots j_{q (d-1)}} $$ For all invertible $g$ one has $$ g\phi(T)=({\rm det}(g))^{q} \ \phi(gT) $$ and $$ g\psi(S)=({\rm det}(g))^{-q}\ \psi(gS) $$ as trivial consequences of the even more trivial identity $$ \sum_{i_1\ldots i_d\in [d]}\epsilon_{i_1\ldots i_d} M_{i_1 j_1}\cdots M_{i_d j_d}= {\rm det}(M)\epsilon_{j_1\ldots j_d} $$ and also a good pair of glasses. Moreover, one has $$ \psi(\phi(T))= \frac{1}{(d-1)!^q} \ T $$ as a consequence of Cramer's rule for the identity matrix, namely, $$ \sum_{j_1\ldots j_{d-1}\in [d]}\epsilon_{j,j_1\ldots j_{d-1}}\tau_{i,j_1\ldots j_{d-1}}=(d-1)!\ \delta_{j,i} $$ The above is prep work for a reduction of the FFT for $SU(d)$ to the case $q=0$ and $p$ divisible by $d$. Let us now assume that $q=0$ and that $T\in\mathcal{T}_{p,0}$ is invariant, i.e., $gT=T$ for all $g\in SU(d)$ or rather $SL(d)$. Since any $g\in GL(d)$ can be written as $g=\lambda h$ with $h\in SL(d)$ and $\lambda$ some $d$-th root of ${\rm det}(g)$ then since $gT$ is a homogeneous polynomial we more generally have $gT=({\rm det}(g))^n\ T$ for all $g\in GL(d)$, and even for all $g\in {\rm Mat}_{d\times d}$. Here $n$ denotes the weight $p/d$. We now have $$ ({\rm det}(\partial g))^n\ gT=({\rm det}(\partial g))^n\ ({\rm det}(g))^n T=\rho_n\ T $$ The heart of the proof (as well as of the understanding of the Haar measure as pure combinatorics), is to show that $$ \rho_n=({\rm det}(\partial g))^n\ ({\rm det}(g))^n \neq 0 $$ The most precise way of doing this is via the "Cayley identity" exercise which gives the explicit formula $$ \rho_n=\frac{1}{c_n} $$ But a cheaper argument goes as follows. When summing over the permutation in $S_{nd}$ which I called a Wick contraction scheme (just the Leibnitz rule) arising in the computation of $\rho_n$, one gets a sum of squares: what I called the two decoupled (rather than connected) components that I mentioned earlier are identical and deliver the same numerical evaluation. One just need choose one of these contraction schemes, for instance, coming from $$ \left[({\rm det}(\partial g))\ ({\rm det}(g))\right]^n $$ and check it is nonzero. The germ of this "mirror symmetry" between the two components is visible in the right-hand side of the basic identity I used $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial g_{cl}}g_{i b}=\delta_{ci}\delta_{lb} $$ I guess that's enough details for you to finish the proof of the FFT for $SU$ or $SL$. Let me simply say that this is not my proof but Clebsch's in his amazing article "Ueber symbolische Darstellung algebraischer Formen" in Crelle 1861. (Please click on the full text link and read Section 3 of that article and in particular pages 12 and 13 which contain the sum of squares non-vanishing argument). As another comment about history, I put quotes when talking about the "Cayley identity" because (of course Arnold would say) it is nowhere to be found in the works of Cayley. The earliest instance I have seen is in Clebsch's book on binary forms for $d=2$. No doubt, he must have been trying to get a better understanding of the $\rho_n$ coefficients and also the Gordan-Clebsch series (see my JKTR article). Tony Crilly, Alan Sokal and I are supposed to work on an article on the history of the "Cayley identity" but we have been distracted by other tasks. It is on the $({\rm back})^n$-burner with $n$ large. 

The main theme here is the attempt to generalize the Isserlis-Wick Theorem for Gaussian integrals to the case of exponentials of polynomials of higher degree. Let $$ P(x)=a_n x^n+\cdots+a_1 x+a_0 $$ be a polynomial of even degree $n$ with $\Re\ a_n>0$. Then the integral $$ J=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-P(x)}\ dx $$ converges. One can expand $\exp(-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}a_i x^i)$ inside the integral and factor out the constant $e^{-a_0}$ $$ J=e^{-a_0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-a_n x^n}\sum_{r_1,\ldots,r_{n-1}=0}^{\infty} \prod_{i=1}^{n-1}\frac{(-a_ix^i)^{r_i}}{r_i!} \ \ dx $$ and also take the sum out $$ J=e^{-a_0}\sum_{r_1,\ldots,r_{n-1}=0}^{\infty} \prod_{i=1}^{n-1}\frac{(-a_i)^{r_i}}{r_i!} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-a_n x^n} x^{r_1+\cdots+r_{n-1}}\ dx $$ using absolute convergence. Finally one is reduced to integrals of the form $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-a_nx^n} x^r\ dx $$ which vanish if $r$ is odd and otherwise are equal to $$ 2\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-a_nx^n}x^{r+1}\ \frac{dx}{x}=\frac{2}{n}a_n^{-\frac{r+1}{n}}\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-t}t^{\frac{r+1}{n}}\frac{dt}{t}=\frac{2}{n}a_n^{-\frac{r+1}{n}} \Gamma(\frac{r+1}{n}) $$ after the change of variables $t=a_nx^n$. For a no-go result about higher degree Isserlis-Wick theorems see $URL$ Also things work well if one expands the interaction (in QFT lingo) lower degree terms using the leading monomial as the free reference measure. If one does it the other way as suggested in Igor's comment then exchanging summation and integration is not allowed. Nevertheless one should still recover the integral from the series using Borel-Leroy summation, see: $URL$ 

I think this is specific to the $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ situation, or rather $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}_2(\mathbb{C})$. The identity boils down to $det(A)det(B)=det(AB)$ for $3\times 3$ matrices. It's a simple calculation using Pauli matrices. 

Let me comment on points 4) and 5). The problem with infinities in QFT or traditional equilibrium statistical field theory is related to the one addressed by Martin's theory but there are some differences. For concreteness let me talk about the $\phi^4$ model only. Mathematically, the problem it poses is to make sense of the probability measure $$ \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}\exp\left( -\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\{ \frac{1}{2} (\nabla\phi)^2(x)+\mu \phi(x)^2+g\phi(x)^{4} \} d^dx \right)\ D\phi $$ on the "space of all functions" $\phi:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. This is the kind of heuristic formulas one finds in physics QFT textbooks. The symbol $D\phi$ stands for Lebesgue measure on this space of functions and $\mathcal{Z}$ is a normalization constant so the full space has measure one as befits a probability measure. Now let's turn this into a well posed mathematical question. First remove the $\phi^2$ and $\phi^4$ terms, i.e., consider the case $\mu=g=0$. Then this measure $\mu_{C_{-\infty}}$ makes perfect sense. It is the centered Gaussian measure on the space of temperate distributions $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and with covariance $C_{-\infty}$ given by $$ C_{-\infty}(f,g)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\frac{\overline{\widehat{f}(\xi)} \widehat{g}(\xi)}{|\xi|^{2}} d^d\xi $$ for all test functions $f$ and $g$ in $S(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Using this first rigorous step, one can reformulate the problem as that of making sense of $$ \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}\exp\left( -\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\{ \alpha (\nabla\phi)^2(x)+\mu \phi(x)^2+g\phi(x)^{4} \} d^dx \right)\ d\mu_{C_{-\infty}}(\phi) $$ with a new normalization constant $\mathcal{Z}$ that I will still keep calling $\mathcal{Z}$. I also introduced the "wave function renormalization coupling constant" $\alpha$ for more generality. We made a bit of progress (we avoided the problematic Lebesgue measure $D\phi$), but this still does not make mathematical sense because $\mu_{C_{-\infty}}$ is supported on nasty Schwartz distributions and pointwise powers like $\phi^2$ and $\phi^4$ are ill-defined, just like $\Phi^3$ in Martin's answer. This is the source of the UV (ultraviolet) infinities. There are also IR (infrared) problems due to the integration inside the exponential being over $\mathbb{R}^d$ instead of a compact set. To address these issues, we need what the French call troncature et régularisation. Let $\rho_{\rm UV}$ be a mollifier, i.e., a compactly supported $C^{\infty}$ function $\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ with $\int \rho_{\rm UV}=1$. Let $\rho_{\rm IR}$ be a cut-off function, i.e., a nonnegative compactly supported $C^{\infty}$ function $\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ which is equal to 1 in a neighborhood of the origin. To slice Fourier momenta into (Littlewood-Paley) shells we introduce an integer $L>1$, not necessarily equal to 2 as is customary in harmonic analysis. For $r,s\in\mathbb{Z}$, define the rescaled functions $\rho_{{\rm UV},r}(x)=L^{-dr}\rho_{\rm UV}(L^{-r}x)$ and $\rho_{{\rm IR},s}(x)=\rho_{\rm IR}(L^{-s}x)$, and consider the probability measure $\nu_{r,s}$ given by $$ \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}\exp\left( -\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\rho_{{\rm IR},s}(x)\{ \alpha (\nabla\phi)^2(x)+\mu \phi(x)^2+g\phi(x)^{4} \} d^dx \right)\ d\mu_{C_{r}}(\phi) $$ where $\mu_{C_r}$, or regularized Gaussian measure, is the direct image of $\mu_{C_{-\infty}}$ by the convolution map $\phi\mapsto \rho_{{\rm UV},r}\ast\phi$. In other words, $\mu_{C_r}$ is the centered Gaussian measure with covariance $$ C_{r}(f,g)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\frac{|\widehat{\rho_{{\rm UV},r}}(\xi)|^2\ \overline{\widehat{f}(\xi)} \widehat{g}(\xi)}{|\xi|^{2}} d^d\xi\ . $$ A good metaphor would be to say that your orginal flat-screen TV was too smart. The linear size of the screen was $L^s=\infty$ and that of a pixel was $L^r=0$. Instead one should make $r$ and $s$ finite so that $\nu_{r,s}$ is mathematically well defined, and then study the limit where $r\rightarrow-\infty$ and $s\rightarrow\infty$ in the sense of weak convergence of probability measures on the topological space $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Now renormalization theory in physics tells us that unless we allow the couplings $(\alpha,\mu,g)$ to depend on the UV cut-off scale $r$, the following is more likely to happen: 1) we don't converge (e.g., loss of tightness), 2) we converge to something utterly uninteresting like the atomic measure on the singleton $\{\phi=0\}$, 3) we converge to something less trivial but still uninteresting, namely, a Gaussian measure like the GFF $\mu_{C_{-\infty}}$ or white noise, or massive free fields interpolating between the two. Therefore the weak limit we need to study depends on the choice of bare ansatz $(\alpha_r,\mu_r,g_r)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$ (or rather the germ of this sequence at $r=-\infty$). Finally, the well posed mathematical question I promised, regarding trying to make sense of the original $\phi^4$ functional integral is the following. Problem: Find an explicit parametrization of all weak limits (of probability measures on $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$) given by $\lim_{r\rightarrow-\infty}\lim_{s\rightarrow\infty}\nu_{r,s}$ for all possible choices of bare ansatz $(\alpha_r,\mu_r,g_r)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$. What renormalization theory in physics also tells us is that although it seems one has a hugely infinite-dimensional amount of freedom in choosing the sequence $(\alpha_r,\mu_r,g_r)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$, the set $\mathscr{T}$ of weak limit points is a finite-dimensional variety. For $d=3$, one expects three parameters or "renormalized coupling constants" $(\alpha_{\rm R},\mu_{\rm R},g_{\rm R})$ suffice. One can even get rid of $\alpha_{\rm R}$ if one quotients by taking constant multiples of the random field $\phi$. There are rigorous renormalization group techniques for constructing portions of $\mathscr{T}$. Kupiainen's work mentioned by Ofer is an adaptation of these techniques to the time-dependent rough SPDE setting. The above is what I call the non-anchored Gibbsian way of trying to construct elements $\nu\in\mathscr{T}$. There is a completely different approach which I call the anchored stochastic quantization approach. There one need to make sense of the SPDE in Martin's answer, which he did locally in time. Then one needs to understand this SPDE globally in time and construct an invariant measure which gives $\nu\in\mathscr{T}$. This is also fraught with difficulties but there has been quite a bit of progress in this direction (see, e.g., this article related to invariant measures and Martin's comment below). The key difference between the two approches is that in the non-anchored setting one does not have a fixed probability space to work with. In the second anchored situation one does since all fields are functionals of the driving noise. In the anchored setting, $L^2$ estimates involving second moments only are enough to prove convergence in probability and thus in law for the random fields of interest. In the non-anchored situation one needs to control all moments (correlation functions) with uniform $n!$ bounds on these moments. It is hard to say more as an MO answer, but you can see these preprints for further explanations:
