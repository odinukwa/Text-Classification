The Hattori-Stong theorem describes the image of the morphism: $$\tau:\Omega^{SO}_*\rightarrow H_*(BSO;\mathbb{Q})$$ that associates to any closed, smooth, oriented manifold $M$ the homology class $\phi_*([M])$ where $\phi$ is the classifying map $M\stackrel{\phi}{\rightarrow}BSO$ of the tangent bundle and $[M]$ is the fundamental class of $M$. This theorem describes all the relations satisfied by the Pontryagin numbers of smooth manifolds in terms of integrality conditions. Question: do we know the topological analogue of the Hattori-Stong theorem, i.e. do we know all the relations that Pontryagin numbers of topological manifolds should satisfy? Edit: as we have an isomorphism $\Omega^{Top}_*/Tors\cong \Omega^{PL}/Tors$, this question also amounts to knowing all the relations that Pontryagin numbers of $PL$-manifolds should satisfy. 

When $X$ is a Riemannian manifold you can build very nice models of free loop spaces, based loop spaces and path spaces, you can have a look at "On "small geodesics" and free loop spaces" by Bahri and Cohen available on arxiv. This is based on Milnor's papers on classifying spaces. Thus what you get is a topological group $GX$ which is $A_{\infty}$-equivalent to $\Omega X$ and a homotopy equivalence between the Borel construction of the adjoint action of $GX$ on itself and the free loop space. A point in $GX$ is an equivalence class of a sequence of points $[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ where $x_0=x_n$ is the based point, $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ are close to each other in a geodesic sense, modulo some cancellation rules. The group structure is concatenation of sequences of points. And the map from $GX$ to $\Omega X$ is by considering composition of geodesics segments. You can also build models of path spaces, free loop spaces in this way. With this gadget you will have maps of fibrations compatible to composition of loops and that are homotopy equivalences. This construction can be adapted to triangulated spaces, the idea uses the fact that you have a notion of close points and a unique geodesics segment between them. 

As you know extending $P$-localization functors to non-nilpotent spaces is a very delicate matter. You can do it by homotopical localization techniques. if you do it in this way you get functorial localization which work for non-nilpotent spaces "but" it is the aim of your question it is not "very explicit". Now let me be very naive and let us go back to D. Sullivan's MIT notes "Geometric topology, localization, periodicity and Galois symmetry" chapter 2 (these notes are really beautiful to read). D. Sullivan first explains how to do $P$-localization when we have a CW-complex, of course he also explains that this CW-procedure gives a "nice localization" when the CW-complex is 1-connected (in that case it is our modern $P$-localization). He proceeds on the skeleton of the CW-complex, localizing cell by cell. Thus you can apply Sullivan's telescope construction to a circle and then to a wedge of circles and any CW-complex you want. The starting point being the localization of spheres through a telescope of maps $S^k\stackrel{\times p}{\rightarrow }S^k$ (you invert degree $p$-maps). The point is that you can argue that this naive construction on non-nilpotent CW-complexes is not what you expected as a $P$-localization. D. Sullivan also explains how to do it when we have a Postnikov tower. Let me add that there is another interesting way to $P$-localize which is due to C. Casacuberta and G. Peschke: "Localizing with respect to self-maps of the circle" Trans AMS 339 (1993) 117 – 140. This $P$-localization is as "explicit" as a homological Bousfield's localization but the homotopy related to it is very interesting. In that setting, a space is $P$-local if and only if the $p$-power map on the loop space $\Omega X$ is a self homotopy equivalence if $p\notin P$. 

to Leonard- An important example of homology pull-back is given by the intersection product. Let $M$ be a closed oriented manifold then we define this product as: $$H_i(M)\otimes H_j(M)\stackrel{\times}{\rightarrow} H_{i+j}(M\times M)\stackrel{\Delta^{*}}{\rightarrow} H_{i+j-d}(M)$$ where $\Delta^*$ is the homology pull-back of the diagonal $\Delta:M\rightarrow M\times M$. The intersection product was first introduced by means of geometric transverse intersection of cycles. Bredon "Geometry and Topology" explains it and makes the relationship with the cup product which is its Poincaré dual. He does not explain how to do when the cycle is not representable by a manifold but this is a good starter. Fore general cycles, as I explained in my other answer either you play with simplexes viewed as manifolds with corners or you play with manifolds with singularities. M. Kreck in his book "Differential algebraic topology" did it for a particular type of manifolds with singularities and he proves all the tranversality results you want in order to define homology pull-backs. M. Goresky in his PhD thesis studied it in the case of stratified pseudomanifolds and also build a geometric homology and a geometric cohomology thanks to what he called Whitney chains and cochains. Here you need transversality for stratified pseudomanifolds (it works inductively strata by strata). This is in the smooth world, if you are more a PL-guy then you should have a look at: S. Buoncristiano, C. P. Rourke and B. J. Sanderson "A geometric approach to homology theory", Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1976 Another good reference is: Jakob, Martin "Bivariant theories for smooth manifolds." Papers in honour of the seventieth birthday of Professor Heinrich Kleisli (Fribourg, 2000). Appl. Categ. Structures 10 (2002), no. 3, 279–290. It is another geometric approach to homology theories where homology pull-backs are geometric pull-backs. In fact this all goes back to Quillen, D. "Elementary proofs of some results of cobordism theory using Steenrod operations." Advances in Math. 7 1971 29–56 (1971). I like and recommand Jakob's paper because it is related to the framework of Fulton, W.; MacPherson, R. "Categorical framework for the study of singular spaces." Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 31 (1981), no. 243 which explains how to mix homology covariant and contravariant morphisms in order to have a good framework to get Riemann-Roch types theorem. To conclude this geometric interpretation of homology pull-backs certainly goes back to the first days of homology in algebraic topology before cohomology was invented. 

Edit 1: In a first version there was a question about string topology of Lie groups. A very good reference about string topology of Lie groups is "String Topology for Lie Groups." J. Topology (2010) 3(2): 424-442 by Richard Hepworth. The main point concerning your first question is to understand how to describe the BV-operator (the $S^1$-action) on $\mathbb{H}(G)\otimes H(\Omega G)$. Luc Menichi has also a nice paper on that theme: "A Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra morphism from double loop spaces to free loops", Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 363 (2011), 4443-4462. .............................................. Edit 1 (continued): 

$\textbf{Edit:}$ Wall's classification depends on (in non exceptional cases): 1) The quadratic structure on $H^*(M)$, 2) The tangential information classified by three classes: $\alpha\in H^n(M,\pi_{n-1}(SO))$, $\beta\in H^{n+1}(M,\pi_n(SO))$ and a third element $\phi\in H^n(M,\mathbb{Z}/2)$. 

Let $X$ be a H-space with multiplication $\mu$ and unit $e$, let us consider the map $$\Phi:\Omega_e X\times X\rightarrow \mathcal{L}X$$ given by $\Phi(\omega(t),x)=\mu(\omega(t),x)$. This continuous map satisfies: $$ev_0(\Phi(\omega(t),x))=\mu(\omega(0),x)=0=pr_2((\omega,x)).$$ Then it induces a morphism of fibrations between: $$\Omega_eX\times X\stackrel{pr_2}{\longrightarrow} X$$ and $$\mathcal{L}X\stackrel{ev_0}{\longrightarrow} X.$$ Playing with long exact sequences of homotopy groups, you deduce that $\Phi$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. We know from a result of Stasheff and Arkowitz that a space $X$ has all its generalized Whitehead products trivial if and only if its loopspace $\Omega X$ is homotopy abelian. For example $\Omega \mathbb{C}P^3$ is homotopy abelian. Let us look at the fibration: $$\mathcal{L}\mathbb{C}P^3\rightarrow \mathbb{C}P^3$$ it does not split, this answers negatively your second question. Let me give some details: 

Geordie Williamson has a very nice set of notes on perverse sheaves: $URL$ it deals with some examples on curves (section 10). You can also look at De Cataldo and Migliorini's paper (section 2.2): $URL$ 

Let us consider the Moore space $S^{n-1}\cup_{p^r} e^n$ with $p$ a prime greater than $3$ and $n\geq 4$, then F. Cohen, J. Moore and J. Neisendorfer proved that the homotopy groups of these particular Moore spaces contain infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}/p^{r+1}\mathbb{Z}$ summands. Ref: Cohen, F. R.; Moore, J. C.; Neisendorfer, J. A.; "Torsion in homotopy groups." Ann. of Math. (2) 109 (1979), no. 1, 121–168. 

Let $V$ be a proper singular complex algebraic variety, possibly nonprojective ($dim(V)=n>0$). I would like to know: 1) if its second Betti number is non zero, 2) same question but now $V$ is a compact Moishezon space. Edit: (as written by Francesco Polizzi) $b_2\geq 1$ in the case of normal projective varieties (we even have a Hard Lefschetz theorem in intersection cohomology). We also have $b_2\geq 1$ in the case of smooth complete algebraic varieties, this gives a topological criterion to prove "non-algebraicity" of some smooth complex manifolds. Thus my question is really about: 1') complete but singular algebraic, 2') compact Moishezon spaces (because they are analytification of complete algebraic spaces). 

I will suggest to look at: "Differential Algebraic Topology: From Stratifolds to Exotic Spheres", Graduate Studies in Mathematics, 2010, Matthias Kreck. Here the author defines homology in a completely geometric way as a bordism theory of singular spaces called stratifolds, and he explains intersection product in this setting, relying on transversality results for stratifolds. For example if you consider a smooth proper complex algebraic variety $M^n$ of dimension $n$ and two cycles $W^l$ and $U^{k}$, let us say that these cycles are complex algebraic subvarieties (not necessarly smooths) of $M^n$ they are stratifolds and modulo a transversality argument you can define the intersection product of these cycles as: $$[W^l]\bullet [U^k]=[W^l\cap U^k]\in H_{2n-2k-2l}(M^n).$$ What I like in this approach is that any homology class is representable by a stratifold and that M. Kreck explains how you can intersect these objects. Another good place to learn about intersection product is Bredon "Topology and geometry" chapter VI section 11, or Dold "lectures in algebraic topology" section "Intersection of homology classes". In these two books they explain how the intersection and cup product are related via the Thom isomorphism. 

At least in the case of complex algebraic varieties one can give a nice topological interpretation of the normality condition. Let us consider $V$ a complex algebraic variety, then its complex points $V(\mathbb{C})$ has the structure of a stratified pseudomanifold. Let me recall that a stratified pseudomanifold $X$ is a filtered topological space $$X_0\subset\ldots \subset X_n$$ such that each stratum, i.e. a connected component of $X_i-X_{i-1}$ is a manifold of dimension $i$ and such that $X_{n-1}=X_{n-2}$ and such that the regular part $X_n-X_{n-2}$ is dense in $X$. Together with a local condition: the existence of conical charts. Thus $V(\mathbb{C})$ comes equipped with such a geometric structure. In the setting of stratified pseudomanifold one has a notion of normal pseudomanifold and normalization is a fundamental concept in intersection homology. A pseudomanifold $X$ of dimension $n$ is said to be normal if for every point $x\in X$ the local homology group $H_n(X,X-x,\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. Notice that a homological manifold is normal. Using Zariski’s Main Theorem, one can prove that a normal complex algebraic variety is a normal pseudomanifold. If you consider a triangulation $T$ of $X$ ($dim(X)=n$) then you can also prove that $X$ is normal if and only if the link of eack simplex in the $n-2$-skeleton of $T$ is connected. This is proved in Goresky, MacPherson "Intersection Homology theory" (Topology Vol. 19 (1980)). In this paper the authors also explains how to build normalization topologically and how topological normalization satisfies a universal property. In the case of $V(\mathbb{C})$ its topological normalization in the sense of Goresky-MacPherson is homeomorphic to $V'(\mathbb{C})$ where $V'$ is the algebraic normalization of $V$. Thus topologically normality corresponds to the connectivity of the links, the link of a point in an $n$-dimensional manifold being a $n-1$ sphere we see that topological normalization is the very first step to desingularization of stratified pseudomanifolds. Here are two examples: 1) The pinched torus is not normal. It is a complex projective curve $C$ of equation $x^3+y^3=xyz$ in homogeneous coordinates $[x:y:z]$. It has a unique singular point $[0:0:1]$ and the link of this point $p$ is homeomorphic to two circles (we have $H_2(C,C-p;\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}$). 2) The quadric cone is normal. It is an algebraic surface $S$ of equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=0$ in $\mathbb{P}^3(\mathbb{C})$ in homogeneous coordinates $[x:y:z:w]$ it has a unique singular point $[0:0:0:1]$. We notice that this space is homeomorphic to the Thom space of the tangent bundle of the $2$-sphere $S^2$. This remark gives a homeomorphism between the link of the singular point and the unit sphere bundle of the tangent bundle of $S^2$ which is connected (we get that $S$ is topologically normal). Historicaly these two examples were important for our understanding of the failure of Poincaré duality for singular spaces, they appear in Zeeman's thesis: E. C. Zeeman, "Dihomology III. A generalization of the Poincaré duality for manifolds", Proc. London Math. Soc. (3), 13 (1963), 155-183. and also in McCrory's thesis: C. McCrory, "Poincaré duality in spaces with singularities", Ph.D. thesis (Brandeis University, 1972)
