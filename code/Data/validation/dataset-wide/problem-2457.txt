Kamma is fourfold and is divided into sections, i.e. by "way of function, order of ripening, time of ripening and place of ripening". Kamma by "time of ripening" is further subdivided into 4 types according to the time of taking effect: 

I would really recommend reading this book since it has a lot of insights about emptiness. I think sometimes its greatly beneficial to study another buddhists school's take on e.g. Anatta/Emptiness in order to "get it" cooked and prepared in another way. Of course the basic doctrine is the same but when reading about it in other terms and ways of expression that gives variety and nuances on the topic. On purpose i did not go into the insight-meditational aspect of this profound teaching that emptiness is since you asked for an intellectual opinion. Hope this might be of some help. Lanka 

One meaning is, that every being has the capacity to win Nibbana. Nibbana is already there but its covered in thick layers of ignorance (avijja) and has been plastered over with concepts and conventions. The unconditioned state is an existing reality, that can be experienced when the meditator has done away with ignorance, clinging and attachment and cultivated the paramitas to full maturity. 

Imagine you have a seed. That seed has the possibility to turn into a tree but only if the right conditions are met. For example, the seed needs water, fertile soil and maybe a little fence around it so that people will not step on it. If the seeds grows into a small young tree, then again it needs certain conditions to continue growing. For example it needs fertile soil, sunlight, water and again a little fence around it, so that cattle won't eat its leaves. Its exactly the same case with Kamma. Kamma needs the right conditions to ripen and thereby come to fruition. If these conditions are not met, then the Kamma will not ripen and it will instead become Defunct (ahosi) Kamma. For example, in the case of an Arahant. All their accumulated kamma from the past which was due to ripen in future lives, will become defunct when the Arahant passes away, since he/she will not get reborn. The Arahant has destroyed all fetters and cut all roots and thereby all causes and conditions for the past kamma to ever come to fruition. 

I think the difference lies in the approach that medical science and Buddhism uses. Buddhism deals with the true nature of reality, i.e. Ultimate Reality based on the gaining of experiental knowledge through insight meditation. Medical science deals only with Conventional Reality, i.e. concepts, conventions and entities such as "a body, a man, a woman" etc. When one is not dealing with the true nature of reality one cannot treat anything else than symptoms. Medical science treats the symptoms of Dukkha. Buddhism treats the root cause of Dukkha by going to the root of the problem, i.e. Avijja. The Buddha's teaching is the only one that will ensure a permanent cure for suffering, i.e. Nibbana. 

The Path is the same for all beings, although since all beings have different kamma due to past actions, all beings are on different stages of the Path. So one being might need to practice certain path factors, e.g. Sila more than another being and vice versa. Regarding The Ten Perfections (Paramis) they are often compared to jars and when one practices a parami one fills the jar with a drop. So again, how full a jar is, is different from being to being. One being might have worked extensively on the Dana-parami, while lacking in the Aditthana-parami. 

Once the Buddha was sitting at the Ganges River with his monks. Then a piece of foam came floating down the river and the Buddha said, you see o'monks that piece of foam. The monks said yes we see Ven. Sir. The Buddha then said that materiality, i.e. the 1st aggregate of form is like that piece of foam. From a distance that foam looks solid. It looks like it has a structure. But when one inspects that foam closely one will come too see that it is hollow and empty of any structure. - Chris W. provided us with the text-reference SN 22.95: Phena Sutta: Foam. Modern science have figured out that physical matter is almost empty space. It's like 99,9% is empty space and the rest is physical matter. But even that physical matter that looks so solid is also devoid of structure and solidity. When one examines that matter in a powerful microscope one will come to see atoms. When examining those atoms one will come to see that they too are made up of smaller parts such protons, neutrons and electrons. When examining those parts one sees that they are made up of even smaller parts such as quarks. Science believes that quarks also have substructures but does not yet have the technology to confirm that. With quantum mechanics they have now gone a level deeper. All this have now turned out to be a cloud of probability meaning that an electron can be multiple places at once and that it "chooses" its location only when its measured by an external observer. For more information on that see the "Double-Slit Experiment". An important thing to add to the need for an external observer is that without an observer there cannot be a universe existing outside the awareness of that observer, meaning that it makes no sense to talk about non-conscious experience. If there is no observer to consciously observe a phenomena then that becomes imagination. Imagination belongs to conventional reality which is based on concepts and has nothing to do with the true nature of reality, i.e. Ultimate reality. These things could be understood to confirm or back up what the Buddha knew and taught 2500 years ago. 

The doctrine of Anatta is very deep and cannot be fully understood by the intellect. If you like to understand what this is about, you would have to do insight meditation. When observing mental and physical phenomena as they arise and pass away in the mind and body, Anatta will eventually be realized, i.e. if one practices correctly and diligently. Intellectually one can understand Anatta as being the uncontrollable and ungovernable nature of conditioned phenomena. One does not have any control over phenomena. Pleasant feelings or formations will not stay, just because one wants them to stay. Likewise, unpleasant feelings or formations will not go away, just because one wants them to go away. The idea of an experiencing entity, a Self or an inner core, is nothing but a mental formation itself. There is no thinker behind the thought. This will as mentioned before, only become clear when practicing insight meditation. We can use a simile of the ocean. Let's go to a place where the ocean is many kilometers deep. Anatta is on the bottom of the ocean. Intellectually one can only swim (understand) a few meters down but experientially one can swim all the way down to the bottom. The experiental knowledge (Paññā) is gained in insight meditation. There is a mental and a physical stream. Volition is part of the mental stream, namely the Mind or the 4th aggregate, i.e. the aggregate of mental formations. Ultimately, there are volitions but there is no person or self doing them. There is nobody home. The house is empty. For reading material, I would recommend "A Discourse on the Anattalakkhana Sutta", by Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw. He explains very well the different aspects of Anatta and he incorporates insight meditation into the discourse, meaning that the way to read this discourse, is to read a bit, then meditate, then read, then meditate. 

Insight meditation will show that "the evolution of mankind" is merely a concept belonging to the 4th aggregate of mental formations. 

The suffering one experiences, when renouncing an object, is directly proportional to the attachment one has cultivated towards that particular object/experience. 

I would recommend watching the video; "Ask A Monk: Pornography and Masturbation (and Addiction in General)" by Ven. Yuttadhammo. He gives an in-depth and detailed teaching on exactly this topic both from a theoretical perspective and a practical, insight meditational, perspective. A step-by-step guide on how to deal with these defilements is provided in the video. May this be of use to you. 

As a "Dhamma"-rule of thumb, if answers lead you you further away from Samsara and towards Nibbana, i.e. by reducing greed, hatred and delusion, then those answers, can be considered wholesome. 

Wholesome states of mind are e.g.; Serenity and insight, the four foundations of mindfulness, the eight path factors and especially the seven factors of enlightenment. 

I do not feel qualified to answer your question in depth. That is why i would like to point you towards these video talks by Ven. Yuttadhammo: 

One does not have to note everything that arises. What is important is to see the objects clearly so that one can come to see their true nature, i.e. the 3 signs of existence (impermance, unsatisfactoriness and not-self). If you note too fast it can result in a restless and agitated mind. If you note too slow sloth and torpor might arise. One should not note too fast or too slow but a place in the middle (way). 

If i may share my own practice. I am training kickboxing and before that MMA and ju-jitsu. Doing this type of sport is a unique way of learning to know the body and mind and also to meditate while doing the training, e.g. when doing stretches to increase flexibility or when training kicks, punches and other techniques. We must again look at the intention behind engaging in this type of training or any training at all. Are the intentions wholesome or unwholesome? To be able to defend oneself is not unwholesome. For you to wish for your daughter to be able to protect herself and be safe is not unwholesome. That is wholesome. That way she will have a safer life. If one were to train martial arts with the intention of using it to harm other people that would be unwholesome and not beneficial in any way. Training martial arts as a way to connect with the present, control the body as far as that goes, increase health and build a strong mind with lots of resolution that is what one can do with the martial arts training. Its the same with weapons. Its not the weapon that is unwholesome or bad. Its the person handling it. If a person with ill-will and hatred in the mind would handle a rifle he might use it to hurt another being. If a person with loving-kindness and compassion handles a rifle he might take the iron from the rifle and melt it into something else. He might take the wooden shaft and use it as timber to burn. He might take the bullets out and use the gun powder to light a camp fire. So in that sense its the same with martial arts. What are ones intentions. Martial arts is like the weapon it can be used for both good and bad things. When one gets really good at martial arts one can then very accurately "measure" how much force one should use in e.g. defending oneself whereas someone who is untrained in martial arts do not have that knowledge. He might hurt a being even more because he cannot control his anger or how much force he uses. A skilled martial artists is peaceful, serene, in control. He knows exactly how much force to use. Just the fact that he knows his body and his techniques so well makes him not want to hurt people. Reaching a high level in martial arts creates humility and calm in a being. Lastly i want to emphazize that i do not mean to say that martial arts should or could be a substitute for training in meditation. The training of martial arts can benefit one in a number of ways as described above. This answer only deals with the martial arts aspect and not the meditational aspect.
