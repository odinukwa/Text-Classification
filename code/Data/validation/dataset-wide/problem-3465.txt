The answer to (1) is that it appears theoretically possible. (In fact, the economic school of thought known as Modern Monetary Theory advocates this.) There is the question of whether this would be a good policy, and the answer to that would be controversial. It should be noted that Quantitative Easing policies of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan involved large purchases of government bonds by the central bank, and there have been no obvious side effects (for example, inflation) yet. These policies represent a step towards the central bank buying up all government debt. The answer to (2) - could the ECB follow such a policy - is a technical question. The actiona of the ECB are limited by treaties; the usual interpretation of those treaties says that the ECB cannot do this. Certainly, the ECB limited its buying of Greek debt based on its interpretation of the treaties. There would have to be a move to change the treaties that restrict the ECB's actions to allow such a move, which seems like a difficult task. From the perspective of French policy, the answer to question (2) is more important than (1). 

This site is aimed to give non-opinion based answers; this question is worded in a way that leads to opinions (“bad”). I will do my best to give a straight answer. I would argue that it is safe to say that there is a lot of hidden politics in discussion of fiscal policy and government debt. If someone does not like policy X, and policy X is popular, it is politically easier to attack X’s effect on government debt than X itself. This could explain the tone of discussions you have read. As you note, it would be possible for a government to set the interest rates on all of its debt if it borrows in a currency that it controls (via control of the central bank). The standard argument against such a policy is that by doing so, the central bank would lose control of inflation. (That is, it needs to be seen to have the flexibility to raise interest rates to keep expected inflation under control.) There’s a lot of different theoretical arguments to get to that result. (As a disclaimer, I would note that I disagree with them, so I will not attempt to present them.) Unfortunately, these arguments are often based on cryptic mathematics. You could try asking another question specifically on that topic to get a further background. (I did a quick search, but the questions I saw had various issues. In order to get good answers, you need to ask a very specific question, and avoid introducing editorial comments, as answers end up responding to the editorial comments.) The next line of attack is that by increasing debt, interest costs are rising (assuming interest rates are positive). This implies that these costs become an increasingly large part of the budget. Furthermore, overlapping generations models (OLG models), typically suggest that this results in generational unfairness. (Future generations are disadvantaged relative to the current generation.) Finally, there is the “intertemporal governmental budget constraint.” This constraint - if it holds, which is unclear - suggests that governments will need future primary surpluses to match current debt levels. (The primary surplus is the budget balance excluding interest payments.) The theoretical status of the budget constraint is controversial, but one could argue that it is related in practice to the previous argument about interest payments. 

The entry “offering amount” is the total par value that is being auctioned. (In the example given, this is a reopening of an existing issue, so it is the increase of par value for the issue.) From the perspective of a bidder, the “par value” is what they are awarded, which will only be a portion of the total par value of the issue. (There is a maximum bid size specified, which prevents a single bidder from taking down the entire offering.) 

(This perhaps should be considered a comment.) If you have solved the HJB equation, it is sufficient to get the optimal solution. So you do not "have to be concerned with any other optimality conditions," which I believe appears to answer your question. It appears that you are concerned about the "necessary" component of the theorem. The necessity side of the statement is as follows: if there is an optimal solution, there must exist a solution to the HJB equation. I have not worked with this particular problem, but the answer in general is that we do not expect to have a differentiable function V. Therefore we do not have a solution to the equation as it is stated. Instead, we need to look at generalised derivatives, and convert the HJB equation into an inequality. In which case, you may get a "viscosity solution." If we extend to use generalised derivatives, it may be possible to prove that a such a solution always exists. Glancing at your proofs, they will not help on the necessity conditions, as you are assuming differentiability. 

We need to keep two things seperate: the unit of account, and instruments. The unit of account is a currency unit, like the U.S. dollar. When the price level (e.g., CPI) rises, the cost of goods measured in that unit of account rises. We then have monetary instruments, like $20 bills, or bank accounts. Their value in the unit of account are unchanged. Therefore, they drop in value versus goods and services (as expected). The prices of stocks and bonds may go up or down, for any number of reasons. Like other things, their value is measured in the unit of account. Therefore, it is unclear what relationship there will be between the price level change and financial asset prices. For example, CPI inflation has been close to a 2% annual rate since the Financial Crisis, and stock indices have generally risen much faster than that. As for interest rates, the relationship is: bond price up, yield down (and vice versa). 

You get the average cost by dividing the total cost by the number of shares. When you sell, the price you sell at does not matter for the determination of your average cost. You reduce the number of shares by the number of shares in the transaction, and you reduce the total cost by the (average price)*(number of shares in the transaction). This means that selling does not change the average price, just the number of shares. Your profit on selling is based on comparing the selling price to the average cost. This would be the “cost of goods sold” in inventory accounting. (If you want more details on this subject, you could look for primers on inventory accounting on the internet.) What you appear to want to do is to roll the profits or losses from a sale into the total cost. That is, if you made a profit, use that to lower the “total cost” of the shares so that you can compare that average of that “total cost” to the market price, and quickly tell if you are profitable. Although that might be convenient, it probably would not be acceptable under most accounting conventions (so no textbook will tell you to do it that way). It also would give some strange-looking results. If you made \$1 million profit on some shares, and then sold all but one of those shares, you would have a “cost” of about -\$1 million for that one share. Most people would look at you funny if you showed them that number on a spreadsheet. 

One initial point: you refer to "printed money", which would normally be restricted to currency in circulation (notes and coins); the parts of the money supply that are electronic are literally not printed. Borrowing on a credit card creates a credit card receivable, which is not normally considered part of most money supply figures. However, if it were part of a securitisation, it might eventually show up as part of the wider money supply aggregates (M3). (The securitisation ends up funded by a money market fund, and money market funds are typically part of "wide" money supply definitions.) Are we collectively shooting ourselves in the foot as a result of this fabricated money? If you think the only objective policy is to preserve the value of the currency unit, perhaps. The relationship between money supply growth and inflation is debatable, but it is seems safe to say that extremely rapid borrowing by the non-financial sector is associated with higher inflation. However, if the objective is to enhance output and employment, not really. Credit cards are just another form of credit. The growth of modern capitalist economies is associated with credit expansion. It may be possible to have a growing economy without credit growth, but it would be very difficult. Investment could only be funded by profits, and it would be difficult to offset the withdrawal of financial assets from circulation by the savings desires of households. Without credit, the only mechanism to recirculate savings to the business sector is via equity injections. In practice, direct equity investment is not a significant source of funding for the business sector. That is, stopping credit growth chokes off funding for businesses in practice. In other words, we can say that society faces a trade-off between monetary stability and growth; the exact nature of that trade-off is somewhat fuzzy. 

If the yield is unchanged over one year, the total return over the year is roughly equal to the starting yield. If the yield changes, we add a capital gain/loss which is equal to the change in yields times the yield sensitivity. This is the modified duration of the bond, at 9 years maturity. 

I would highlight this article on money creation in the modern economy (by researchers at the Bank of England) - (link to article). A key observation is that modern central banks do not directly determine the money supply, they set the rate of interest. (The policy of Quantitative Easing complicates matters, but what is happening there is that the monetary base is larger tha usual, but the central bank cannot set it below an effective minimum.) This means that the central bank is not really determining "the money supply", but rather reacting to the private sector's demand for money at the target interest rate. In other words, the central bank has no ability to keep "the money supply" at a constant level. (The fact that the "money supply" is a vague term does not help. Is it M0?) It would have to move around the interest rate in a fairly erratic fashion in order to attempt to keep the money supply constant. (This was experienced during the money growth targeting experiments in the 1970s and 1980s.) The money supply does not have stable short-term relationship to other economic variables. Even if it were possible to keep it constant, what objective would that achieve? Other variables would be moving around, in probably unwelcome directions. Instead, developed country central banks attempt to keep an economic variable that people care about - inflation - near a target level. (Other targets include fixing the price of the currency versus a foreign currency, or even gold.) From a theoretical point of view, if money velocity were stable, nominal GDP would be stable if the money supply did not grow. Since we expect real GDP to grow as a result of productivity growth and population growth (in most countries), the implication is that there would be a steady deflation in the price level. This would imply that workers would need to get annual wage decreases, which is a situation that is psychologically unwelcome. As a result, there is a bias towards a positive rate of inflation. This implies growth in the money supply (assuming constant velocity). A psychological bias against deflation is not just an arbitrary preference; in real-world data, wage decreases are avoided. (Sorry, I do not have a reference; I discuss references later.) Therefore, if policy attempts to force wage decreases, the result is that workers are laid of instead. Output would fall, that is, there would be a recession. This is a suboptimal outcome from almost any standpoint. An additional real-world issue is that debt contracts are entered into with the implicit assumption of positive earnings growth. Deflation leads to mass defaults, and recession. There is a large literature on the optimal level of inflation, which was a hot topic when central banks entered into the inflation targeting. The reader should be able to find dozens of articles in this vein either with web searches or at the websites of inflation targeting central banks. I found this survey paper from the Bank of Canada published in 2015, which I assume would be authoritative (I have not read it). (Link to survey paper.)
