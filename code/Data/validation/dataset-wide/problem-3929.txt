And if not what is the simplest counterexample? A counterexample would be an infinite sequence of surfaces: $\{S_1, S_2, \cdots \}$ and infinite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers: $\{n_1, n_2, \cdots \}$ such that $S_i$ can not be embedded in $\mathbf{P}^{n_i}$. 

Some context: $A$ is a generalized Cartan matrix, $\frak h_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a real form of the Cartan subalgebra in the Kac-Moody algebra associated to $A$ and finally $X$ is the Tits cone. Question: if one reads the proof given by Kac, it is written for $X$ and not $\overline{X}$. Is there a mistake or am I missing something here? 

I am wondering what are the prerequisites for being a modern geometer? It seems that the amount you have to know is just huge: differential geometry, differential topology, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, ... and then there is all kinds of overlap. So my question is the following: what should you know (from the topics I mentioned and the topics that I forgot) to call yourself a geometer (lets say by the time you get your Ph.D.)? And where are the best books/articles covering all that? 

The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the algebra of distributions on the Lie group $G$ with support at the identity. The proof I have of this fact uses the universal property of the universal enveloping algebra and hence it is not constructive. I was wondering if there is an explicit map? For example what would happen for $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C})$ and $G = SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? For an explicit monomial in $\mathscr{U} \ \left ( \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C}) \right )$ can we write the corresponding distribution and how it acts on functions on $SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? 

I have the following question. Assume we have a Riemannian manifold $M$ with the induced metric given by $d$. I am looking for a canonical way to compare two elements $v,w\in T^n M$, where $T$ denotes the tangent bundle of a manifold. For instance, for $n=0$, we can compare two elements $v,w\in M$ by $d(v,w)$. For $n=1$ we can compare two elements $v,w\in TM$ by parallel transporting the vector $w$ to the basepoint $\pi(v)$ of $v$ and setting $D(v,w):= d(\pi(v),\pi(w)) + \|v-\tilde w \|$, where $\tilde w$ denotes the result of parallel transport of the vector $w$. This is how far I get, for $n=2$ I cannot think of a natural way to compare two points. Is there a natural notion of distance on $T^nM$ for $n>1$? 

Usually, high order partial derivatives of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$ can be described by a multiindex $\mathbf{k}=(k_1,\dots, k_n)\in \mathbb{N}_0^n$, see for instance $URL$ The quantity $k_i$ describes the number of partial derivatives in the $i$-th direction. The reason why this notation captures all cases of high order partial derivatives is that the order of differentiation is irrelevant, so that the number of derivatives in each coordinate completely describes a partial differential operator. Suppose, we would like to describe high order partial covariant derivatives of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to M$ for a Riemannian manifold $M$, for instance (n=2) $$\frac{D}{dx^1}\frac{D}{dx^2}\frac{d}{dx^1}f.$$ Since, in general, the order of differentiation is relevant, one cannot simply describe this operation by a multiindex $\mathbf{k}=(k_1,\dots, k_n)\in \mathbb{N}_0^n$. For example, if we use the multiindex notation for the covariant derivative above, we would get the multiindex $(2,1)$, which would equally correspond to the operator $$\frac{D}{dx^2}\frac{D}{dx^1}\frac{d}{dx^1}f$$ which is different from the original covariant derivative operator. My question: Does there exist a unified notation for high order partial covariant derivatives for functions $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to M$? 

Let $V$ be a normed infinite dimensional vector space. Let $L: V \longrightarrow V$ be a bounded linear operator. Moreover assume that $L$ is 'locally nilpotent' that is: $$ \forall v \in V \quad \exists n \in \mathbf{N}: L^n (v) = 0. $$ Now my question is if the linear operator: $$ \exp (L) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{L^n}{n!} $$ is bounded or not. 

EDIT: corrected a mathematical mistake pointed out by Jim Humphreys, also improved the format as to make things more visible. Again suggested by Jim Humphreys. 

For $SL(2, \mathbf{C} ((t)))$ the affine Grassmanian is defined as: $$SL(2, \mathbf{C}((t))) / SL(2, \mathbf{C} [[t]])$$ Now that is fine but $SL(2, \mathbf{C} ((t)))$ has smaller parabolic subgroups. Define: $$B = \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{O}^{\times} & \mathcal{O} \\\ t\mathcal{O} & \mathcal{O}^{\times} \end{pmatrix}$$ where $\mathcal{O} = \mathbf{C}[[t]]$. Then: $$ SL(2, \mathbf{C} [[t]]) = B \left \{ 1, \begin{pmatrix} & 1 \\\ -1 & \end{pmatrix} \right \} B $$ Question: Why are people so much interested in the affine Grassmanian when it actually sits in a larger, equally well behaved projective ind-scheme (in our example above $SL(2, \mathbf{C}((t)))/ B$)? Both are flag varieties for the loop group so it seems natural to go with the full flag variety. 

I am more or less in the same situation as you are. After careful consideration I decided that I should abandon academia for good. Because as far as I have seen your career in academia is very dependent on where you start out. If you do a postdoc in University of Nowhere the chances of getting a decent job after that will be even lower than it is now. There is a temptation to think that by hard work you can compensate for the bad start in your career, resist that temptation. As it stands now I will be applying for finance jobs later in summer. Consider applying to big traditional banks (J P Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Wells Fargo, ...) investment banks (Goldman-Sachs, Morgan Stanley) and big hedge funds (Renaissance Technologies, D E Shaw, Citadel). If you want more info about 2.5 years ago there was a small article in Notices on the transition from academia (specifically math) to finance. The author had a Ph.D. in number theory and went on working for D E Shaw (PDF): $URL$ Also don't worry about the state of financial firms. They have fully recovered from the effects of the great recession of 2007-2009: $URL$ 

Let $X$ be a geometrically integral smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. Then if $X$ is everywhere locally soluble, we have $Pic(X) = H^0(k,Pic (\overline{X}))$, where $\overline{X}=X \times_k \overline{k}$. This can be proved using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence and the fundamental exact sequence of class field theory. My question is about the converse: If the canonical injection $Pic(X) \hookrightarrow H^0(k,Pic (\overline{X}))$ is an isomorphism, then is $X$ everywhere locally soluble? An example of a class of varieties for which this holds is for Brauer-Severi varieties, however my intuition tells me that this is not the case in general. Does anybody have a good counterexample? 

A first naive guess would be that this classifies varieties $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ which become projectively isomorphic to $X$ over $\bar k$; however this is clearly seen to be false on taking $X = \mathbb{P}^n$. It might help to put this problem into a more general framework. Namely, let $(X,L)$ be a projective variety equipped with a line bundle $L$. Denote by $\mathrm{Aut}(X,L)$ those automorphisms of $X$ which preserve the isomorphism class of $L$. 

Let $k$ be a field with algebraic closure $\bar k$. Assume that $k$ is perfect and not of characteristic $2$ for simplicity. Let $$X: \quad Q(x)=0, \quad \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k,$$ be a non-singular quadric hypersurface over $k$. Then it is well-known that $X\times_k \bar k$ is birational to some projective space, with the birational map given by stereographic projection. My question is whether some analogue of this holds over $k$. Namely 

Suppose I have a $C^\infty$ smooth function $f$ defined on the reals. I can apply Taylor's formula and get the local expression $$ f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^l\frac{f^{(i)}(0)}{l!}x^i+ f^{(l+1)}(\xi(x))x^{l+1}. $$ Question: Is the function $\xi $ smooth? The function $f$ can in principle be as nice as you want. 

Given a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, I am looking for a symmetric matrix $S\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ such that $$ S A + A^T S = I $$ $A$ can be assumed to be regular (with positive determinant, if this is of any help). The difficulty is of course that $S$ must be symmetric, otherwise one could simply take $2S = A^{-T}$. In principle this is a linear equation with $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ unknowns and this can be solved for $S$. Is there a nicer way to find $S$ such as a closed solution formula using some factorization? Has this problem been studied anywhere? 

The Stiefel Manifold is defined as $$ \mathrm{St}(p,n):= \{ X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p} :\ X^T X = I_p \}. $$ Recall that the tangent space at a point $X\in \mathrm{St}(p,n)$ is given by $$ T_X{\mathrm{St}(p,n)} = \{\xi\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}:\ X^T\xi + \xi^T X = 0 \}. $$ Given a point $X\in \mathrm{St}(p,n)$ and a tangent vector $\xi \in T_X{\mathrm{St}(p,n)}$, it is possible to express the exponential map $\exp_X(\xi)$ using the matrix exponential function. A formula is given in the paper www.mit.edu/~wingated/introductions/stiefel-mfld.pdf . My question is whether the inverse $\log_X(\cdot): \mathrm{St}(p,n) \to T_X\mathrm{St}(p,n)$ can also be expressed using the matrix logarithm. A related question is the following: Instead of the exponential function one may define other retractions such as $$ R_X(\xi) = (X+\xi)(I_p + \xi^T\xi)^{-1/2} $$ or the closest point projection $$ R_X(\xi) = \pi(X+\xi), $$ where $\pi$ maps a matrix $A$ to the closest element in the Stiefel manifold. This projection can be easily computed using SVD. Again, the question is wheter one can find simple formulas for the inverses of these retractions. Any helpful comments would be greatly appreciated. edit: at this point I do not really care which metric is used (the Euclidean metric or the one inherited from the orthogonal group). 

Yes. First if there are no solutions in $\mathbb{R}$ or in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$, then there are no solutions in $\mathbb{Z}$. This condition is not sufficient in general; there could be a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the Hasse principle. For more about the Brauer-Manin obstruction for integral solutions to quadratic equations, see: $URL$ 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be regular integral Noetherian schemes. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are smooth and proper over a base scheme $S=Spec R$, where $R$ is a discrete valuation ring. If $X$ and $Y$ have isomorphic generic fibres, is it also the case that their special fibres are isomorphic? Remarks: 

Under the assumption that $f$ is completely split (so that $E$ has full $2$-torsion), this is done in many books. Here we have $\mathrm{H}^1(k, E[2]) \cong k^*/k^{*2} \times k^*/k^{*2}$, and given such a pair one can write down explicit equations for the associated homogeneous space. If $f$ is irreducible, then I believe that $E[2] \cong \mathrm{R}_{K/k}(\mu_2)/ \mu_2$ as group schemes, where $K/k$ is the cubic extension associated to $f$. Hence we have $\mathrm{H}^1(k, E[2]) \cong K^*/k^*K^{*2}$. Given an element $c \in K^*$, I would like to be able to write down explicit equations of the associated principal homogeneous space. I'm guessing that one would need to write down these equations in the Weil restriction of an affine space. 

Recall that a Borel subgroup $B$ of $G$ over $k$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ over $k$ such that the base change of $B$ to the algebraic closure $\bar{k}$ is a Borel subgroup of $G \times_k \bar{k}$. Of course Borel subgroups need not exist in general; when they do one says that $G$ is quasi-split. If $G$ is not quasi-split then the statement is vacuously true.
