Minor league baseball players on affiliated clubs (non-independent leagues) are payed by their parent organizations. Proceeds from the games go to a variety of other things like travel and stadium expenses. See Wikipedia 

Pole Position is important It is not a guarantee of a win, but it is strongly correlated with first place and top five finishes. The Link above has the analysis for each starting position for every race in NASCAR history that contained 43 cars (the modern number of cars). The person with the pole has won just fewer than 80 of those races. The person who started second has won fewer than 60. However, something fascinating about the full analysis, the most likely result of any top five start is a first place finish. Without having a full data set to work from it's hard to tell much else (and the pictures of the other datasets are quite small). But it's notable that as you go down in starting position your likely outcomes get more diverse. The tail is very short on the pole position, but it grows as you go down in starting position until it is nearly flat at 20 and an inverse of the #1 graph at #43. The pole position may actually not make a difference in an of itself though. The pole is won by the top qualifier. That means that they've had the best car on the track through qualifying. So what we have, is the data confirming what qualifying has already told us. That this car is faster than the others. However, the fact that the pole car doesn't win more races shows how many other factor are in play. In other words, correlation does not imply causation. In fact it's very likely that we're dealing with reverse correlation here, wherein a top five position isn't the result of pole position, but because pole cars are faster/better driven. 

Finding old games is a relative challenge, and doing it will likely cost you some cash if you can do it at all (legally). There does not seem to be a legal method to watch old NBA games. For classic NHL games the NHL offers a subscription service called "NHL Vault" for $5 a month. I don't know how complete the archive is, but it looks pretty solid. MLB has a limited selection of old games online as well, though you may need an MLB.TV subscription. And the NFL offers a "game rewind" feature on their website for a fee ($70 a season for full access). The NFL archive only goes back to 2009 though as well as some "classic super bowls". You can also try youtube, a limited number of games may be available there (or parts of them). The legality is possibly debatable there, but at least they comply with take downs etc. 

It's a long road to get from the draft to the major leagues, excellent players often shortcut one or many levels of their team's farm system, but most players play for at least part of one season in the minor leagues (the last player to go straight to the bigs from the draft was Mike Leake in Cincinnati a couple of years ago) 

Which of the three you choose largely depends on who you have available on the bench, how close the same is and who the pitcher is. If we assume it's late game, the score is tied, and the pitcher is only going to pitch one more inning (with a slightly better than average bullpen), then we can go from there. Now, with the pitcher up 3rd in the order, there are three possibile situations: 

The first four is an appeasement of major conferences, basically. A recent SI/Time piece outlines a story from the late 80s. The basic tenant of the story was the major conferences had gotten together and decided that the bottom two conferences would be eliminated outright from the tournament on selection Sunday. Until the Princeton Georgetown game that was very likely to become policy. Instead what happened was a near upset by Princeton caused that discussion to be taken off the table. The small conferences counter offered a play-in game. Originally the play in game was just the worst two automatic bid schools. Teams that won their conference tournament and had earned their way in. This preserved their automatic bids but also gave the power conferences an additional at large team in the tournament. A few years ago, the NCAA decided to expand further. However, they didn't want to minimize the effect of winning small conference tournaments, so instead of having all 4 play in games being automatic bid qualifiers, it was set out that two of the games would be automatic bid schools vying for 16 seeds, and that the other two games would be the final four at-large teams vying for the final at-large seeds. This year's tournament those seeds were 11 and 12 seeds, however, those seeds can be higher or lower depending on the composition of the rest of the field. 

Sports are so lucrative for the reasons you mention (huge ad revenue). But you fail to mention the reason the ad revenues are so high. People don't Tivo sports. Sure some people do, but for the most part people want to watch sports live. This is why ad revenue is so high. Football (Soccer) has struggled to get a TV footing in the states, and has only now just begun to do so. There are two main strategies for monetizing football games here: 

This summer the NFL has opened the preseason in a labor dispute with officials, and are instead using college officials from no BCS conferences are replacements until the dispute is involved. What issues have been seen this preseason and what issues should we look forward to. What steps if any has the NFL taken to mitigate the influence of inexperienced referees on game outcomes? 

This page shows that the pitch caught the very bottom of the zone per PitchFx. The zone is technically from the letters to the knees. Granted, it's not always called that way, but this is how PitchFx is calibrated. This isn't an expanded zone, it's actually exactly the zone they are supposed to call. Note that the zone is measured from the front of home plate, not where the catcher catches the ball. This pitch was very flat though, I don't have replay of it, but it doesn't look like it broke much from the pitchFx data. As far as the true lower limit, Page 22 of the MLB rules indicates that the zone is below the kneecaps, not above them. 

There are two kinds of foul shots, those that end in possession of the shooting team, and those that are up for grabs on a miss but awarded to the opposing team on a make. Normal foul shots on personal fouls are the second kind. Both teams are free to rebound a miss and the non-shooting team is awarded the ball on a make. However, for flagrant fouls and technical fouls the team that shoots the free throws is awarded the ball regardless of the result of the shot. Since the rebound cannot be contested the player is allowed to shoot by himself. 

So while the Mets (or reporters covering the Mets) may be using pitch count as a test, it's not the only one. However, if they are applying it, there are reasons they'd be doing so. The Mets young rotation is a significant asset to their team. It took them to the World Series last year and most of their young hurlers have three things that make them incredibly valuable: age (they're all quite young), talent (they're all quite good), and team control (they're all under contract for the next several years). Because they are such significant assets, it makes a great deal of sense for the Mets to take care of them in the most effective way possible. If they think that's by only allowing some of them to throw 80 pitches a game, then that's what they'll do. 

Yes. Homefield advantage does play a role late in close games. Though my brief analysis indicates that it doesn't account for all of the record disparity. Fangraphs has a great model that predicts, based on game state, how likely a given team is to win at any given moment in the game based on historical data. Let's look at a recent 0-0 game that went all the way into the bottom of the 10th and was won in a walkoff. Cubs vs Pirates, opening day. We can see in this game, that starting in the first inning, the home team had about a 4 percentage point better odds in the middle of the inning then they did at the beginning of it. This increased as the game continued until the 9th and 10th innings where the odds are 11.4 percentage points higher. However, it's worth noting that at the top of each inning the odds are 50-50. When both teams have equal numbers of at-bats remaining, the odds are about the same when the score is tied at 0. Let's look at one more situation. Let's look at a one run lead going into the 9th inning. We'll need to examine two games for this one. In the first game, the home team is up one to begin the 9th. We'll use this Orioles vs Redsox game also from opening day. The odds of the Orioles winning was 83.3. Contrast this to the odds of the Away team winning a 1 run game in the 9th. For that we'll use this Braves vs Nationals game. Looking at the odds going into the top of the 9th, we see that the Braves had a 84.9% chance of winning it, but after going hitless in their final at-bat, their odds of winning were only 81.6%. The contrast to note here is the 1.7 percentage point difference going into the last at-bat for the losing team. When the home team has another at-bat it makes a difference nearly 2% of the time. Obviously these two examples don't account for the full home field advantage, but the fangraphs data does show a clear edge for the home team historically due to last action.
