Just ask! When you talk with them, emphasize specifically how you intend to be a full contributor, and specifically how you intend to be extremely productive - even though you won't be physically present. Give specific examples of the kinds of things you will do to stay connected, based on what you learned while working remotely as an intern. De-emphasize the parts about family, girlfriend, and travel, as these are about your lifestyle and not about the company or job. As @Carson6300 wisely states: "Nobody wants to hear a laundry list of reasons why remote work is better for you. You need them to hear reasons why it is going to work well for them." More and more employers these days offer work-from-home as a benefit. Some permit this for the full work week, others for part of the week, and others just on an as-needed basis. Many of the employers who offer full work-from-home options are the types of jobs that are performed individually, with no need for collaboration, and very few meetings. Call center employees are a classic example. Sometimes other customer support positions fit in this category as well. As you have indicated, entry-level developer jobs which are solely remote are indeed fewer in number, but may be growing in popularity. My experience has been that companies tend to offer telecommuting more to trusted, longer-term developers. And many companies feel that close collaboration with others in the company (of the kind that can't happen remotely) is important, and don't offer much remote work at all. I recently worked at a company that offered telecommuting on a case-by-case basis. It wasn't offered to anyone that hadn't been with the company for at least a year. And you had to make a pretty good case to show that it wouldn't negatively impact your work, or the work of your team, to be granted work-from-home privileges. Simply saying "I am more productive from home" or "I want to be able to visit my girlfriend" wouldn't be enough. I was able to be granted permission to work from home one day per week, after I showed how I could move all the many meetings needing my physical presence to other days, and how I could continue to be reached easily while remote. I was already at the company for eight years when I was given this permission. As you say, your internships with the company may have given you enough positive history to convince them to allow you to work remotely. The fact that you have already worked remotely, and have certainly complied an outstanding remote work history will work in your favor, too. The only way you'll know is to ask. 

Yes, you should include all of your relevant experience. If your 9 months of Software Development experience is at all relevant for the position you are seeking, then you should include it in your resume. Your experience is something you have that few other freshers will have. You already know how to work, presumably in a corporate setting. That may make it valuable for your potential employer. Employers are seldom worried that they can only train someone who has never worked before. If you can learn one technology stack, it's not a stretch to imagine you could learn another. And during your interview, if it should come up, you can easily stress how happy you would be to learn their technology. 

I always laugh and say "Please call me Joe." That almost always works. (Although you should probably use your first name rather than "Joe"). 

It's possible, although very unlikely. Few companies mess around with reimbursing these sorts of expenses - the small amounts aren't worth the negative reputation they would get. More likely, they just haven't cut accounts payable checks for the month yet. While 3 weeks is understandably a long time for you, for most vendors expecting a check it's not. In many companies the process of submitting a reimbursement request and having a check issued is tedious. Send a polite email, asking when you can expect to receive your reimbursement. Then try to be patient and not worry until it's warranted. 

As is often the case - it depends. If you sense that you are being placed on another team because they need your particular talent and expertise, then you should feel honored. If you sense that you are just an added headcount and you find that you are the only one on your team that is moved to other projects, then you might feel that your value on your primary team isn't as high as other team members. Either way, unless you sense that you would be first in line in the case of layoffs, it's likely nothing to worry about. Try to make the most of it and increase your value to as many teams as possible, and to the company as a whole. When in doubt, I like to default to the positive - you are so valuable that everyone fights to have you on their team. I know that when I'm a team lead, I try to get the best help I can, not just whoever happens to be around. 

It's seldom inappropriate to apply for internal positions. Companies often post positions internally in hopes that good current employees will step up and apply for these positions before they are opened up externally. In many ways, it's best for a company to promote from within whenever they can. Applying for an open internal position is seldom viewed as a negative, although some poor managers don't like to see their employees move to other departments, making the manager's life harder. You don't want to do this too often, as that could send a signal that you aren't happy with your current position, but an occasional attempt at a better position shouldn't be a negative.. That said, you haven't even been with the company for a year, and you indicate that the new position is several pay grades above your current position. This might be an indication that your chances for landing the job aren't terrific. Since some companies have rules about how often you can apply for internal positions, and how soon after joining, check those first before you decide to pursue this move. Still, the only way to know for sure if you could be considered for this new role is to apply and see what happens.
