Unfortunately, this is a possibility and I have seen it happen before. At a previous firm, I extended a formal offer to a data architect. He turned in his notice and accepted the position, but before his start date, my organization announced a hiring freeze - effective immediately, and including hires in progress. I lobbied very strongly to allow this hire to go forward, but the decision was made at the highest levels of management not to honor the offer. I felt terrible that I had put someone in this position, and the situation was a contributing factor in my decision to leave that organization shortly thereafter. If something similar is happening to you, you should take at least a bit of comfort that you won't have to work for an organization that treats people that way. 

It may be difficult to ask this question without appearing to be rude or arrogant. You run the risk of poisoning the well if you ask the founders of the company to prove their competence at the very start of the relationship. Let's say you're the hiring manager in a similar organization. What would you think of this request? If you consider what it implies about your day-to-day interactions with the employee for years into the future, would you want to have the person who made it on your team? Think carefully about these things when wording your question (or deciding whether to ask it). If you decide to go forward with asking your question, you should phrase it as wanting to make sure your skills are a good fit for the existing code base, and not that you're worried about having to clean up someone's mess. 

Bottom line is that you're not networking to build x number of "contacts". Business networking and Facebook have nothing in common. You're networking to build meaningful relationships with people in order to help each other advance your respective careers. It's a mutually beneficial relationship when done right, and quite often doing it right means doing it over a long period of time. You wouldn't apply a "formula" to your personal relationships - don't try to apply one to your business relationships. 

Most potential employers would be understanding in this situation. They will expect that you cannot provide references from your current position. A couple of potential options come to mind: 

Contact them when you find something that you think will be truly useful to them. Don't, don't, don't spam your networking contacts! You don't want to be "that person". Contact them when you have something of substance that they can do for you, e.g. when you have a question that they are well-suited to answer or when you would like advice on a particular topic. If you make something up in order to ping your contacts, many of them will see through this and, once again, you'll be "that person". 

Why not ask your volunteers why they're leaving? Create an anonymous survey and send it to the people who have volunteered for the past couple of years. Ask questions about why they left; what would have motivated them to return; and their overall impressions of the program. You will get much better results from this approach than from trying to guess their motivations. 

My impression is that the emails aren't meant to address your skill level. As @Brandin says in the comments, this looks like a fairly routine tug-of-war between two departments for resources due to competing projects. I wouldn't read too much into your manager's assessment; you're not the target audience and he wasn't speaking to you. He's trying to justify his decision to the other group and is probably using phrasing that matches what he thinks they need to hear. There's no need to take this personally, especially since you self-identify as unfamiliar with the technology involved. 

I think the best approach for this would be to highlight the increase in responsiblity in your resume rather than the increase in salary. Increased responsibility implies increased salary already, and I don't think it's at all appropriate to mention specific salary (or even percentage of salary increase) in a resume. Focus on the specific ways in which your responsibilities grew, with special attention to the ones that match the things that you want to be doing in the future. If this is done correctly, the confidence that your employer has in you should speak for itself. Edit: I would not recommend bringing this up in the interview either. As a hiring manager, I would be a bit concerned by any mention of salary increases in an interview - you don't want to give the impression that you're making a decision strictly in terms of salary, especially since you've stated that salary isn't your primary motivation. If you feel that you must mention this, you should do it in the most general terms possible, e.g. "My manager was so pleased with my performance that I was given raises that greatly exceeded the industry average." 

How do you know that nothing has been done? How do you know that she got away with it? Keep in mind that disciplinary actions are completely private in well-run organizations. You should not - and should not expect to - have any insight into any sort of corrective action against a fellow employee. For all you know, your co-worker could have gotten the exact same written warning. Or something more severe. Or something less severe. It's really none of your business, and you will likely be told so if you try to bring it up to improve your own circumstances. Your best approach is to handle your own situation and ignore your co-worker's. If you feel that you were wrongly accused, by all means contest the situation, but let your case stand on its own merits. Apply appropriate evidence and reasoning based upon YOUR circumstances. There's no need to bring the other person's situation into it. 

You can route the Google Voice voicemail notification to your email You limit the spread of your "real" phone number and can more or less ensure that any calls to the Google Voice number are related to your resume 

These are just a few possibilities - there are many others. Always remember that your management is acting upon information that you don't necessarily have, and it's dangerous to make assumptions based solely upon your limited knowledge of the situation. I would suggest simply asking your manager if you were considered to lead the project, and if so, why you weren't selected. If you can do this in a non-confrontational way, you will preserve your good relationship with your manager while gaining some insight into his decision. 

I wouldn't say that this is common, but depending on the company, the level of the position, and the desirability of your particular skill set, you may be able to get some traction. I have negotiated similar bonuses for management positions in the past. As a hiring manager, I would consider the length of time remaining before your bonus award date to be a factor when determining whether to offer a signing bonus to compensate for loss of annual bonus. If that date is one month away, I would be much more likely to offer a signing bonus than in your case, where it's six months away. A lot of things can happen in half a year. If I really wanted you on my team, I might instead offer a review after six months instead of at your anniversary date, with the possibility of an "annual" (not pro-rated) bonus at the six-month review. If you are really interested in the position, you may consider taking a similar approach rather than asking for a signing bonus; it involves less risk for the hiring organization by deferring the immediate payout, and it also provides you with a performance incentive for your first few months. It should make no difference to you, as you would get your bonus at around the same time anyway, and this approach has better chances for success in my opinion.
