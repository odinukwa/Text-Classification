Problems: Ants are very large, guard ants are huge Relatively low numbers of troops, there could be 1million ants in a nest Advantages: Humanoids are very small Individual intelligence Tunnel your way in! The humanoid tunnels will be far too small for the ants to counter attack back up them. You can approach your target area, assuming you have some intelligence from inside the nest, without troubling the guards who will themselves be larger than the average ant. Once you've hit your target you can retreat quickly to the safety of your own tunnels without risk of counter attack. I'll leave the logistics of building the tunnel to your own engineers. 

You've just developed a new form of international stalemate: Mutually Assured Assassination If you attack our country we'll assassinate your entire leadership. All of whose names and faces are publicly known. While the country could be attacked, you're going to lose a lot of people who consider themselves to be important. Presidents, Defence Secretaries, Queens, Prime Ministers etc. If you feel the almost guaranteed loss of these people is worth the risk, then yes, sure you could invade. However should any of these people die unexpectedly in mysterious circumstances the leader of Lalalistan will be prime suspect and probably wouldn't survive the week. 

Access to raw materials As already mentioned isolation is critical for this. Consider the motor car. Electricity had its limitations, the steam car was trying to find its feet, then Henry Ford got his hands on the production line and the internal combustion engine and everything went over to petrol. Consider a situation where petrol hadn't been available in, say Europe, for whatever reason. The petrol car would have taken off in some regions and the steam car in others, both technologies would have been able to mature in their own right. The same situation is true of the katana and the European swords of the same era. The katana is light, sharp and brittle, it's very good for cutting through the bamboo armour that the Japanese had. Their shortage of good metal prevented the development of metal armour and hence they didn't need a sword that could break it. The heavy European swords were designed to break European armour and hence had very different characteristics. People argue endlessly about which is better, but what's ultimately true is that each was situational to the needs of the people who made them. Different needs, different raw materials, lead to different, but equivalent, technologies. 

It's fairly simple really, patent and copyright only apply within the borders of a country in which the product is registered. There are various international systems but no universal treaty. Since Santa is manufacturing outside an area where these treaties apply, he's not bound by copy protection laws. Since he's not selling the items, they can't be taken off the shelves. He's clear and free. 

You seem to be more worried about how they got to Scotland rather than the ultimate answer, they're in Scotland one way or another. There is a niche, it allows a plant to be very tall, long lived and deep rooted, but allows it to be slow growing. If you cut off one path to get to that niche, life will take another, but nature abhors a vacuum, something will inevitably take that niche. Bamboo grows tall, narrow, and fast. It doesn't really attempt to compete for space with plants around it, only for height, but it does tend to grow in high density monoculture. Trees grow slowly and compete with everything around them for light, space and nutrients and ultimately, height, but they often grow in massively diverse environments. If you expose bamboo to the competition that trees face there's no reason why it shouldn't develop into a variety that grows more slowly and competes for area as well a height. You probably wouldn't recognise it as bamboo though, it would likely look a lot like a tree. The question of whether it would be a bamboo that took the niche or whether some other woody plant would get there first is an unanswerable question. 

The same way we did from the 17th Century up until artificial fertilisers: The four field system. $URL$ 

If you're taking the technology to perfection then any detectable energy has to apparently pass through volume covered by the cloak entirely unchanged from any angle. If that's not the case, then the technology isn't perfect. An energy weapon, being detectable energy, would hence have to apparently pass through without being affected. I fire from one side, the person standing beyond gets fried, volume within cloak doesn't even get warm. Using known science? No chance. But then known science barely provides energy weapons so I wouldn't worry that much. It would also be very dark inside the cloak and, if fully concealed by it, you wouldn't be able to see what was going on outside. After all, all detectable energy passes you by. If you want to be able to see from the inside then the cloak is no longer "perfect", it's now a point along the scale and L.Dutch's calculations for how much energy from weapons penetrates apply along with visible light. 

The first is relatively easy to answer, it's much quicker to identify who someone is not than who they are if you're not expecting to find someone. Dental records, finger prints, DNA. Those are the major factors that can be picked up from official records. For personal identification you'll also have options on moles, tattoos, scars, bunions, clothing and other secondary identifying features. Again, using these factors finding that she's not the right girl can be done quite quickly. Finding out who she is, positive identification, is much harder than finding out who she isn't. 

This is entirely up to you, but allows for some entertaining effects if you want it to. Say your speed and rotation are maintained, what are they maintained relative to? The gate? The centre of the galaxy? Any arbitrary other point? If you pick something other than the gate, then you go in at a maneuvering speed and come out on the other side of the galaxy somewhere between 420-480 km/s relative to the local star. 

Don't confuse modern with medieval. The Romans created national infrastructure that needed maintenance, but between their departure and the industrial revolution, such a concept was basic at best and even then highly localised. The concept of "before" and "after" a war is slightly confused in this era. The period since WWII is the longest period of continued peace between the major powers of Europe in recorded history. We've had wars that lasted longer than the current peace. A medieval war consisted of the great and good going off to fight the great and good of another country. The average peasant was not involved and life for them carried on much the same. Unless of course the battle took place on the little patch of land they called home. On the whole, there's nothing to rebuild. Castles were a nice idea, but during one of the Scottish rebellions the rebels realised it was better to demolish than hold them. Roads aren't really a thing outside the cities, dirt tracks at best, maybe a wide dirt track. Bridges are a novelty item, mostly you ford the river or take a boat. People are starving. People starved all the time. The idea of large farms supplying the city is much later, the enclosure act created this concept in the UK and is also considered a trigger for the industrial revolution. Animals weren't removed from the cities until mid-industrial revolution period. Until then if you wanted milk you kept a cow/goat, even in the heart of the city. No schooling. What's schooling anyway? Priests can read and write. The average peasant can't. Apprenticeships, such as they are, would probably carry on because the blacksmith needs a boy or two to assist him. As would be the case in many other trades. Rampant crime? Normal people had nothing to steal. There isn't really space for rampant crime because it needs a middle class. People with both the goods to steal and the money to buy stolen goods. The key to this is the peasants. They had a role, farming, mostly subsistence. The lords came and went but they didn't affect the population on the whole. In England they didn't even speak the same language as the population. They went off to war, and came back, or didn't, and life for the normal people went on unchanged. The peasants are the country, the economy, the food supply, and mostly war doesn't touch them. 

For the same reason as the "plug and play" trope in films is such a joke. If it wasn't for our comms standards we wouldn't understand ourselves let alone aliens. You can't use an AM receiver to pick up an FM signal. How do you expect aliens to understand anything we've broadcast? 

On the kingdom It's clear from your description of adventurers that your kingdom has a problem. A country only exists so far as its own military, logistics and infrastructure controls the territory they claim. Especially in a more warlike age, you can sit there ranting that it's your land by right, but the only right is the right of the sword and if your army can't control that land it's not your kingdom. The same applies whether it's hostile armies, mad mages or troggs. Your territory, your army, your problem. What you can't control reverts to the wilds, the badlands, no-mans land. Once you have to start getting external agents in to control the local pests, people are going to start sniffing around what else you can't control, like your borders perhaps. On adventurers Adventurers should be out adventuring, this is not something that happens within the borders of your country (maybe within the borders of someone else's country though), what happens within the borders of your country is policing and pest control. If mad mages are a common regional pest then your army must be equipped to deal with them. Adventurers are basically criminals with a license, privateers on land if you like. They rob, the kill, they steal, they trespass, they cause ecological disasters. They upset gods and men alike wherever they go. They don't care about local predator prey balances, they don't care that dragons are endangered, that rocs are almost extinct, they don't care about local economies, they don't care how much of a mess they leave behind them on the road littered with the corpses of the people/beasts/things they meet. All they care about is glory, beer, money in approximately that order. 

I'm assuming something like a BMW R1200 GS, it's currently a popular style of bike, and conveniently someone has calculated its centre of mass which lies considerably above the front axle. The simplest way to resolve the issue without having him wearing cutting edge safety gear is to let him land, fall, and hit the wall at an angle bike wheels first. Tyres and suspension absorb the bulk of the force, with decent leathers it's reasonable he could walk away from such an impact with nothing worse than having smacked his helmet against the bike and a bit of shock to his spine. Against future tech and safety equipment, the bike would probably be a self drive with gyroscopic stability systems and automagic braking at the point of detecting an obstacle. Safety gear update All safety gear is sacrificial, the energy of the impact is dispersed by the destruction of the equipment. Airbags are one shot kit, once it's been deployed the airbag must be replaced. This will probably be a replaceable inserted unit. Helmets are destroyed on impact, if there has been an impact the helmet must be replaced. If you so much as drop the helmet on the floor you should replace it. Leathers are generally ok as long as the surface is intact, they're mostly friction protection with a certain amount of inserted armour to protect vulnerable areas (joints and back). If the surface is particularly rough or there were sharp edges involved in the collision, leathers could also be damaged to the point of needing replacement. Bonus Younger people heal faster Impact force is relative to the square of the speed, every 1kmh slower significantly increases his survival chances. 

Access to more dimensions The mutations simply allow them a limited amount of direct access to more dimensions and what we perceive as supernatural abilities is simply the spillover in our dimensions of movement in others. Imagine if you stuck your finger into Flatland. The Flatlanders would see a "you" in a place with a form. 

The First Past The Post voting system tends to stratify into a two party (with occasional smaller parties) system. The classic case being 

That's actually a reasonable level of technology to maintain. The key to it being most things could still be built by one person with the skills. The early days of aircraft, it's still one man in his shed building a flying machine. The early days of cars, before Mr Ford and his production lines, small teams on a small scale and often, again, one man in his shed building a car. While this is late/post industrial revolution era, steam trains crossed the land and dreadnoughts ruled the oceans, for most purposes small scale still worked. As long as the village still has its blacksmith, carpenter, tailor, and local lord with money to splash on such things, it's reasonable to build cars and small aircraft on a local scale. Building one doesn't require a vast factory, just enough space to work and people with suitable skills.
