This can be achived via out of office within outlook, ensure this is turned on within Exchange System Manager. To setup each individuals Out Of Office you would need to go into Tools > Out of Office > complete the screen. It is worth noting that out of office can be configured via outlook web access https:\serveranme\exchange\USERNAME if you have the correct rights you can logon this way and configure it. hope this helps. 

To the best of my knowledge there is no way to achieve what you require through active directory. You may be able to look in your servers DNS to find both the IP's and Hostnames to export to a spreadsheet or other format. You could also use an IP scanner such as angryIP scanner. Hope this helps. 

all of the ports are visible even the ones which no longer show! - a little more information would be all other queues are setup with HP Drivers, but this one is a Xerox 7755 using the correct driver. If I create new ports printing resumes as normal. Has anyone else come across behaviour like this? Why are you using custom ports? This is because printing is being monitored by a print auditing software package which has its own ports. Only this one print queue has this issue, all others work as they should do. Many thanks for looking at this question. Cheers Update Event logs show nothing related or worth while mentioning. The server has been powered off and then backup. The time between the last occurance of the ports disapearing has been about 2 months. All ideas are welcomed! 

I'm not 100% but is this a new user? It could be a problem with the default user profile, maybe worth a look even if it is a stab in the dark! It may also be worth granting the user elevated priviledges to move the Quick Launch bar! Sorry if its not an acceptable answer, just and idea! 

The short answer is: Yes you can. The item you need to look for is Subject Alternative Names (SANs) you can purchase one of these from VeriSign, from 1-3years. Hope this helps you! 

I'm not sure if this is exactly what you are after but www.servage.net offer stupid ammounts of space for about Â£50 per year. it may be worth a look. The offer almost unlimited bandwidth I seem to remember also! 

You dont need to setup parking or the like, simply ensure you have paid for the domain name and check the expiry date, provided you keep paying for the domain you will keep it.You will not lose your domain because there is not hosting assigned to it. Hope this helps! 

Due to the nature of my work (Software Printing Solutions) I tend to work with Microsoft based servers to host printer queues and settings. I am finding it more and more common as we gain new contracts for some systems to be running Linux based systems (always a different variant of Linux) The question is what is a simple distrubution which I can test creating print queues on and how would i share them out so both Windows and Linux based machines could connect to them? It would be helpfull to know both the command line based commands aswell as how to do it through a GUI if one is available. As always your answers are always appreciated. 

Rather than give up and change your windows network to a Linux network becuase your nearly reaching the database limit. (thats how i took your question I appologies if i'm wrong) I wonder how much research you have done into see why your nearing the database limit? I think for only 50 users to be using nearly 75GB of data, your either doing something wrong or users are sending/recieving massive emails whilst keeping them in their mailbox! 

My initial thoughts would be that the computer you are trying to access the network with has lost its relationship to the server - rejoin it to the domain (log on as local admin) How many users? How many computers? All users effected? Any services not working? Server does have valid network connectivity to the rest of the machines? What's changed recently? These questions will help us resolve the problem :) 

If I remember right, 868 error means the server cannot be contact/resolved. are you sure you can telnet to the server on 1723? (providing it's PPTP) My answer is check to make sure you can contact the server that your trying to VPN to with both ping and telnet. 

3 - The hostname is changed on the printer and rebooted, but neither DHCP or DNS update with the new hostname. 

This can then be added to the users logon script path, provided the file is placed in the servers Netlogon folder. EDIT I have just re-read your question. Obviously my method is not practicle if you wish to change many shares. Could you advise if many shares are required to be changed? Hope this helps, any questions let me know. 

I assume from what you are saying that Cougar is your Windows 7 computer. If so the problem you have lies with the changes in security with Windows 7+. You will need to ensure that the windows 7 firewall is configured to allow "File and Print Sharing". You will also need to ensure that you set the folders you wish to share access to are configured correctly both on the share and the NTFS tab. Do both of your computers belong to the same workgroup? Another issue could be Windows 7 provides device discovery, using the "Networking and Sharing Center" you should check to see if device discovery is enabled. Also when connecting your windows 7 machine to the network for the first time you will of been presented with a box asking you to identify the type of network connection which is active. This of course should be set to Home. I have give you a basis to start troubleshooting, please let me know how you get on. 

When you say you have installed the OS, and used the same settings as the old server, does this mean that you have joined the server to existing domain at Site 1? When you say you can access Active Directory can you see all of the users and computers you would expect? My thought so far is: the reason your users cannot login when the new server is connected is that it is not a Global Catalog server, and as a result wont authenticate users. Please see the Microsoft KB article I have linked below: $URL$ You will need to check your DHCP settings, you are looking for the DNS servers and default gateway, the DNS server IP should point to your server and your default gateway to your sites router. Once you have confirmed that DHCP is pointing your client PC's at your server for DNS you need to ensure that you have your DNS forwarders setup correctly. I tend to use googles public DNS servers for forwarding 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 If you need me to expand on the DHCP or DNS settings or where to find them let me know and I will update this answer. I think this is enough to go on with at the moment. 

To answer your questions yes you can do what you propose. I would however if possible swap to enterprise for your PDC but at the end of the day it shouldnt matter to much for you. 

The DHCP server is setup to enable DNS dynamic updates and is set to always dynamically update A and PTR records. 

To ensure the database is not in a dirty shutdown state you will need to do an offline backup. THis means that during the backup process Exchange WILL be down. Please see the attached link which is handy for setting NTbackup with exchange: $URL$ Should your backup be in dirty shutdown state and you need to recover, you would need to look at the eseutil tool to get your database back into action. This link explains more about the /R option: $URL$ Let me know if you get stuck, and I will try to help you more. 

Not sure if this helps, I've noticed that when the console is trying to load data is can sometimes 'hang' have you attempted to leave it a short period of time? Which point of creating the user/users does the console stop responding for you? Do you have any relevant information in the application event logs which could point us in the right direction? Has any new software been installed on the server? 

I see that you have to option to accomplish the above. Setup port forwarding for example: Server A - hosted websites on Port 80 Server B - hosted websites on Port 80 You can use incoming traffic on port 80 and direct it to Server A on port 80 AND use port 81 for incoming traffic and direct it to Server B on port 80 (This is the most simple and cheapest way to do this!) Depending on the capability of your Router and how much you can spend, you could obtain multiple external IP address' and assign each IP address port forwards. ie xxx.xxx.xxx.1 points to Server A and xxx.xxx.xxx.2 points to Server B. The obvious benefit to the second option is that ports can remain the same and depending on which IP address the domain/subdomain is requested your router can handle the request and Route/NAT to the correct server on the correct port. I hope that makes as much sense on text as it does in my head. If you have any questions let me know and I'll do my best to explain it better!
