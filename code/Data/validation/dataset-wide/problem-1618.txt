See HowStuffWorks and note that this manufacturer has both "E-Field" and "Active Cap" sensors. Light So not all fingerprint readers shine light on your fingers. Also, patents such as this mention "light" and have no mention of "infra-red" so at first glance it seems that some sensors may be using wavelengths of light that are not infra-red. Infra-red Some Infra-red light is the same as radiant heat. I'm unsure this would be useful to shine on a warm object like a finger. It would be better to use a passive-IR detector to capture the IR-radiation (heat) emitted by the finger. This is how some night-vision cameras work. In this case there would be no additional IR received by your finger. Compare with Passive Infra-Red (PIR) detectors used in automatic lights and burglar alarms. Infra-Red light is commonly used in domestic heaters and in heaters used to raise chicks. Examples. Examples. So it would be surprising if these were a hitherto unknown cause of cancers. Heating a finger could conceivably cause burns (though biometric scanners are unlikely to need high-powered IR emitters and so are probably unlikely to have circuits capable of carrying the electrical current needed to deliver a harmful heating effect). The power emitted by a typical "high-powered IR emitter" is 20 mW (0.02 W). If this is all shone at a fingertip (area 0.0001 m²) with 100% efficiency (impossible) that gives 200 W/m². Compare this with the heat naturally emitted by your skin which is 40 to 800 W/m² Cancer When I search for "Infra-Red and Cancer" I only get results concerning the use of Infra-Red light to treat (i.e. attempt to cure) cancer! Example Infra-red light is non-ionizing as pointed out by Nico in a comment below. This means it cannot cause the sort of damage to DNA molecules typically needed to cause cancers. Skin cancer has been associated with UV-light (specifically UV-B), not IR light. Maybe there is some confusion. See links referred to in Wikipedia Health To work out any health implications you'd need to know 

In the diagram below you can see that the left side of each retina (which, due to inversion by optics of the eye, receives the right side of the field of view) is connected to the left hemisphere of the brain. However you would think that a person with right hemisphere damage could just direct their gaze to bring both sides of the subjects face into view on the left side of their retina. 

We don't know if the 6% includes or excludes Muslims who speak no English and make no attempt to learn English - The census figures don't tell us if if there are any UK Muslims at all who are content not to speak English and are therefore not "struggling". In the, perhaps unlikely, event that the 6% are all women, not men and are all foreign-born, not UK-born; the 6% would then be 24% of foreign-born Muslim women in the UK. Some notes:

The Fukushima reactors are Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) designed by GE in the 1960s and now designated, by some people, as Generation-1 reactors. According to Wikipedia there are no Generation-1 reactors operating in the USA (they've all been decommissioned - the last was Big Rock Point in 1997). However this system of classification is not universally used.

It is clear that although 80% of what is emitted through the tailpipe is nitrogen, few of us have much interest in that, it doesn't affect what we breathe. However you can see that the engine converts oxygen to CO2 at a rate depending on engine load. This CO2 is emitted through the tailpipe and is therefore a tailpipe emisssion. CO2 emission reduction is the subject of International treaties and the subject of government regulation. In an internal combustion engine, it isn't possible to reduce the total output mass by 99% unless you reduce the input mass by a similar amount. Diesel Particulate emissions These are a health hazard and so are of interest to consumers, manufacturers, regulators and to any journalists capable of accurate reporting.

The story is plausible for two reasons: 1) Most enlisted military personnel at a time of war up to the 1950's were young sexually-active males. This has long been the case and applies to the military of many countries, not just the USA. 2) In some cities in Japan, prostitution was legalised and the prostitutes had rates of STD infection of up to 95%.

It is recommended that you consume no more than 300g of cholesterol per day (about 9 cups of milk). There's a relevant listing of studies at pro-Con Health Benefits of Milk In 2001 the BBC reported

This is consistent with the known facts. It therefore seems unlikely that HAARP has sufficient energy to cause significant earthquakes or cyclones. Nor to influence space, gravity or time in any novel or unusual ways. Dr. Fran De Aquino's paper goes on to discuss his theory of gravitational shielding whereby a couple of people can render heavy rock monoliths weightless by draping them with a "gravitational shielding mantle" that multiplies the Sun's gravity. In my view, this confusion of topics rather undermines the credibility of the article. Whatever harmful effects HAARP may be capable of, this paper does not seem a credible account of them. 

Your cousin got the anecdote slightly wrong. Collins did not report that the soldiers were Nazis (a technicality perhaps) nor that they cut off their own eyelids. Collins didn't actually claim to have seen this himself. In this extract, he doesn't explain what evidence for motivation was found by the two guys (or perhaps the men from the 101st and/or 82nd who told the two guys) nor does he explain how they distinguished other causes of the injury from the cause they suggest. I can't find any other sources that mention German soldiers being deliberately mutilated in this way. There is the history of Johannes Steinhoff a German pilot who was burned in a crash and had to have his eyelids reconstructed after the war. It is difficult to see how this could be the origin of Collins' anecdote. The idea of cutting eyelids off as a punishment (not as a means of preventing sleep) goes back a long way (e.g. Roman stories of the torture of Regulus in Carthage).

This suggests the harm might, at worst, be equivalent to smoking 36 cigarettes - if tar is the major cause of harm and if harm is linearly proportional to exposure.

(my emphasis) There's no obvious mention of preemptive strikes as such, but one interpretation is that the N Korean government regards US military participation in military exercises in and around the Korean peninsula as an act of war warranting a military response. As you can see, their policy is that their response should always represent a major escalation (artillery response to rifles etc) The N Korean state news agency KCNA reports 

So far as we know from their writings, both knew that coloured light could be produced from white light. Both wrote books which discussed, for example rainbows. Al-Haythem certainly lived earlier (965-1030) than Newton (1642-1727) so Al-Haytham understood and wrote about many principles of optics before Newton was born. However it seems that Al-Haytham didn't have a complete explanation, consistent with our current understanding of how the colours of a rainbow are produced. In The Rainbow Bridge Rainbows in Art, Myth, and Science Raymond L. Lee, Jr writes of the considerable achievements of Alhazen (Al-Haytham) but suggests some aspects that he was unable to complete. 

No. It seems that accounts of Talpade's work originate in a book that appeared around 1904 and which has been long discredited by Indian scientists.

Conclusion It follows that possession of MRCVS or FRCVS is insufficient to practise medicine on humans in the UK. Other forms of treatment The above definition of "Practise medicine" is quite narrow. There are other things doctors do which most people might consider falling into the practise of medicine or medical treatment of humans The Wikipedia article on the GMC contains the following quote from a 2007 book titled "Medicine, patients and the law" by Emma Cave and Margaret Brazier:
