Is there any special effective technique (parkour or something similar) for crossing very high and dense mountain pine? Those ones can be really dense, and sometimes the only possibility to cross them is to walk on the top of them, and crossing it is usually very slow and tiring, especially with big backpack that likes to hook the branches. 

Generally the far from the civilization you go, the safer your things are. Thiefs are operating there where people live or where there are a lot of people. Distant rocks, caves etc. are not their target. I have not heard of something being stolen from someone's luggage in mountains, for example. If some point is at least a few km far from the place where you can go with car, you can trust people there. However, you may consider masking your luggage with some wood or leaves, or hide at least the most valuable things under a rock, in not so obvious place. I have experience from geocaching, that even if you know exactly (with ~10m precision) that something is there, it is often very difficult to find it, especially when it's something small. You should only be sure you'll remember where you have hidden it! 

Endurance and muscle strength are completely different things. From my experience and observations, hikers are usually thin (or even very thin) and big, strong muscles doesn't contribute to endurance. Often, because large muscles require more energy, they may be handicapping the hiking endurance. I've observed no endurance difference between big man and woman with so week arms that they have big problems putting their rucksacks on their back. And afterwards, they've walked with it 20-30 km a day! If you want to train for long hikes, you must either do long hikes or long runs. Your body must get used to long strain. It's not only muscles, it's the general energy performance of the body. On a typical long hike a man with weight ~75kg can burn 5000-6000 kcal daily. It's a big strain for the body, and you must get used to it! 

I prefer taking light trekking shoes and sandals. Sandals are very light and take little place, and they are perfect when it's very hot and terrain is light. I often get blisters when my feet are sweating and it's hot, especially when walking on asphalt. In the winter, however, I take heavy trekking shoes. But I have also running shoes - but I use them exclusively for running. If I would have to decide for only one pair, I would choose light trekking shoes. 

There is one thing about tents in general (well, at least I don't know any exception) - they are absolutely not waterproof!. The outer part simply soaks with water and leads it down to the ground. But if you touch it - you have a rain inside. It's just like touching the surface of the umbrella from the below. So there is one thing you must take very seriously when preparing for rain in tent - the outer and inner layer of the tent must not touch!. If you have one-layer tent, nothing can touch the outer layer as well! A tent is actually just a big umbrella. By 2-layer tents you should make the inner layer possibly loose, while the outer layer should be tight. 

When hiding something in the forest on the surface, there's a great practice called UPS (Unusual Pile of Sticks, the German version is very sweet: Hasengrill). They prevent people from boaring a few acres of land and are great replacement for spoiler photos. However, snow makes them invisible. How should I build my UPS to make it visible even in winter? Well, for 2-meter thick snow nothing would help, but it's usual, at least in Central Europe, that snow has 10-20 cm. 

On a very secluded beach on the Faroe Islands (half a day's hike from the nearest road, and you have to climb down a 50m cliff using an old rope), I found these rusted metal objects. They're about 80cm long (daisies for scale) and lay near a lot of driftwood and old buoys. My first suspicion would be a naval mine, but I'm far from sure. 

Dogs of that size are pretty rare. There is actually a wolf pack in these mountains (source). Perhaps most importantly: There were a few more prints on the same patch of snow but nowhere else. The trail was mostly snow-free, but there were a few more snow patches in both directions. Some of them covered the whole path and I could not see any more pawprints on them. They may have been covered by the human footsteps, but I looked pretty closely and could not see any trace of paws, so it appears whoever caused these prints went off the trail. 

A derivate of Geocashing is Geohashing, which started with an xkcd comic. The basic principle is the same: you take a pair of coordinates and try to get there. What differs is the way these coordinates are generated. As the page linked above describes, they are generated randomly each day for each 1°×1° latitude/longitude zone. A good place to look today's location for your area is geohashing.info. You won't find any treasures at the end (usually...), but it's a fun way to explore the countryside around you. You might go somewhere and discover places you'd never go to otherwise. 

This weekend, I was hiking in the Spanish Sierra de Guadarrama. On a small trail north of Navacerrada (used by only a handful of people each day at the moment), at 1905m height, I encountered the pawprint you can see below. It was set in a patch of old snow directly on edge of the path. I actually recorded the precise location on my GPS, you can see it here. 

Recently, nutritional drinks that fulfil the complete nutritional requirements of adults (optimum proportion of carbohydrates, proteins, fats and other nutritients) have been on the rise. Backpackers are probably not the target audience, but their needs should be served pretty well by these shakes. Popular brands are Soylent (US only) or Joylent (Europe based but shipping worldwide). Personally, I have tried Joylent and I still drink it from time to time, especially if I need some quick energy after work before going to the gym but don't have the time to cook. It's not a culinary explosion, but I think it wouldn't be a big problem to live off it for two weeks, especially if you add dried fruit for some variety. It's about 2100 kcal per bag of 600 grams, so for 10 days, assuming you need more than these 2100 kcal due to the permanent exercise, you'd end up with around 10kg. That's quite a load, but significantly less weight would only be possible with a far more fat-centered diet. Apart from the powder itself, you only need water and a plastic shaker. No fire necessary. As long as you have access to fresh water, using the same shaker all the time shouldn't be a problem (if you clean it properly). Realistically, I wouldn't live off that stuff alone, but for my next longer trip I'm planning to cover about half of the food needs with Joylent. 

Another picture with more context After measuring my hand at home, I calculated the the pawprint to be about 16cm in length. Now, according to my research so far, this can either be a wolf or a very large dog. What makes me believe it's a wolf is that 

Additionally to longboards, you could investigate a mini-Malibu ("mini-mal") / mini-longboard shape, with lengths in the region of 7'x" - 8'x". As a beginner you'll find such a board easier to control than a longboard, and thus less frustrating to use, although longboarders will out-pace you when paddling onto a wave. 

Accessibility of the Break Choose breaks that you can reach before tiring, thereby saving energy reserves for the main event of catching and surfing waves. Avoid a long paddle! If legal and safe to do so, it might be possible to enter the surf from a boundary feature to shorten the paddle (eg: shoreline rocks, groynes, piers and harbour walls). Sometimes you can identify channels in the surf where the wash is not rushing towards the shore. A channel may be calm or could be a rip current flowing seawards. These channels can be exploited to more easily reach the break (though can pose a danger to swimmers lacking surf equipment). Boundary features can cause these conditions, or they can arise naturally at intervals in a long shoreline. Safety Plenty of surf locations are safe but you should weigh the specific risks at each spot. Be aware of: tides and washes, potential currents, the form and composition of the seabed, localism, dangerous sea-life and any safety measures (eg: municipal lifeguards, nets and drum-lines). Consult sources of local information (eg: print/online surf atlases and guides, tourist bureaus, posted notices and other beach-goers). Prefer clean and clear seawater. Dirty and polluted water can result from effluent and river outflows, particularly after rains. Swimming and surfing in this water can cause illnesses and heighten the risk an encounter with a shark (if swollen nearby rivers are capable of carrying dead animals out to sea). Seasonal Changes Seasonal changes of climate and weather might result in sizable and consistent waves only at particular times of the year. The best surf season might not align with the warmest air and water temperatures, requiring a wetsuit and possibly booties/ hood/ gloves. Interactions with sea-life might be seasonal (eg: I believe the jellyfish risk in tropical Australia is highest in summer). 

The following is something which could help prevent a knee injury, though you shouldn't be put off trying skiing in spite of it. In the case of alpine/downhill skis, once you have them in hand, rented or bought, the bindings will have been adjusted to release your boot(s) at a pre-determined torsional force, to save your legs from injury. In Europe this is performed according to a published standard. Customers provide their age, height, weight, ability-level and the length of their ski boot, resulting in a calculated "DIN" or "Z" number. (Charts and calculators abound on the Internet for reference, eg: dinsetting.com.) In the event of an incorrect fall, the store-set Z-number ensures that your boot will be released before your tibia breaks, but perhaps not before knee ligaments are injured. I and some recreational skiers I know choose to reduce our Z-numbers so that the boot is released well before this point, ideally before ligaments can be injured. Eg: for a calculated Z-number of 6, one could reduce to perhaps 3.5 or 4 and be okay on medium-steepness slopes (much of the mountain). Too low and the boot will release when skiing normally, which is also undesirable. Never set above your correctly-calculated value. To adjust the binding Z-number, without the boot engaged, turn each of the large screws at the front and rear of the bindings, and observe the Z-number indicator moving accordingly. Initially, set front and rear of both skis to a lower number. If you pop-out prematurely, increment front and rear of both skis by 0.5 (always set F&R of both skis to the same value). Many ski resorts provide sets of screwdrivers at bottom or top lift-stations.
