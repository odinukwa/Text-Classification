It would only be feasible to begin deploying a robotic police force in the event that the dangers to human police became so great that attrition - from casualties or resignation - of human police exceeded the rate of recruitment of new police when the recruits and experienced police are being paid an amount equivalent to the cost of purchasing and maintaining a police robot in the field, or when - despite an unchanged or even decreasing level of risk for human police officers - the cost of purchasing and deploying a police robot decreases such that it is cheaper to field robots rather than humans. That is to say, when bots become cheaper than cops. That said, at the probable cost of a reasonably effective robotic police officer, at present or in the near future, for a robot to be more cost-effective than hiring humans would mean that law and order must have broken down almost irretrievably. There would be many places where the police fear to tread in any strength. Murders of police officers would be a daily occurrence. Police on the street most likely would never operate alone or even in pairs, but might travel in groups of three or more. Police vehicles would be armoured against small arms and even RPGs. Everyone would own a gun or else live in a gated community guarded by private military units armed with military-grade weapons so that they wouldn't have to sully their hands by holding a gun. Emigration would be a major issue, with people leaving the nation for safer pastures. Even then, deploying a robotic police force would be an almost stop-gap measure, as with that level of lawlessness, the nation's days are numbered, and it is likely that the government would become insolvent in relatively short order. It is likely that the nation deploying said robotic police wouldn't have the wherewithal to actually build them, but would be buying them from a more advanced, less lawless other nation. However, the government of a nation in that much trouble is unlikely to spend that money on police robots, they're more likely to divert that money to line their own pockets. Only a truly idealistic government inheriting the aftermath of years of government corruption might actually spend that much money in that way - if they had it. Perhaps they executed the previous, corrupt regime and nationalised all their assets... In the further future, as the price of robots decreases and their effectiveness increases, there may come a point where even a relatively peaceful human society would find it both cost-effective and politically neutral to replace human police with robots. 

This event did, in fact, happen. Almost 500 years ago in Central America, very strange and weird-looking people showed up coming from beyond the endless waters which the locals had no technology to cross. They had strange and powerful, almost magic-like weapons. Cortes had less then a thousand soldiers, but in the end managed to conquer a whole empire. No matter how powerful and fearsome their weapons were, a few hundred men would have had no chance of conquering a whole empire. So how did they manage to do it? The Aztec Empire was brutally oppressing a lot of different tribes, and those tribes decided that they would rather live under Spanish rule than being used as human sacrifices in the Aztec rituals. This is how, when Cortes conquered the Aztec capital, he didn't do it only with his original few hundred men. He had almost 100000 native allies under his command. The Spanish not just managed to temporarily defeat a much more numerous force, but managed to settle down, and the region is now dominated by Spanish culture even 500 years later. The technology of the Aztecs was not much better or worse than the technology of ancient Greece, and the Conquistadors were fewer than 15000 and had less advanced technology than the aliens in the question. So, if the aliens in the question behaved similarly, they could have a very good chance of building a country or an empire for themselves. Instead of mindlessly starting to gun down humans, they could trade with them, then find a very oppressive satrap and convince humans to help the aliens overthrow him. If done right, many humans would see them as liberators, rather than conquerors. Cortes also didn't jump out of his ship while opening fire on the natives on the shore. He wasn't even explicitly sent to conquer, just to explore, trade, and look for opportunities. He found a crumbling empire with a lot of enemies, and he saw it as a very good opportunity. The question asked how the Greeks could defeat the aliens. However, if the aliens were at least as smart as Cortes, then the Greeks would have no opportunity to defeat the aliens, as there would be no united Greek force fighting against them. 

This scenario appears to cover most of the factors, though my reading of the Water Ice Lines and the Formation of Giant Moons Around Super-Jovian Planets paper you quoted seems to indicate that formation of moons such as this is not all that unlikely, just that it would be necessary for the super-jovian planet to migrate to a closer solar orbit with its moons, which would most likely be retained. Tidal locking is a factor of distance and mass. The larger the mass and the distance, the less effect gravitic tides would have on the rotation of the moon, and hence the longer the period required for it to spin down to a synchronous rotational period. An earth-sized moon may still have a non-synchronous rotational period. You need to determine the period over which life evolved or arrived due to some sort of panspermia in order to determine the likelihood of tidal locking by the time your world becomes the focus of your story. Certainly, you would get plate tectonics in such a system. Also, the super-jovian planet eclipsing the sun(s) would provide a major seasonal factor, probably greater than any circumstance of axial tilt or binary star position. However, since a super-jovian planet is likely to be a brown dwarf, this factor may not be as severe as the IR output of the brown dwarf may provide some minimal heating, preventing rapid or total freezing. It is likely that such a world could be human-habitable, albeit with severe seasonal variations in climate related to the moon's position relative to the super-jovian planet and the primary stars. 

It would be just like a regular old cavalry charge, but at least slightly less effective. Mounted knights carried lances which had a much longer reach than unicorn horns, and a human rider can also carry a wide variety of weaponry. Once in a melee, a unicorn cannot do much with its horn, while a human rider can chop at his enemies from above. So, if the unicorns had riders on them, then it's no big difference from any historical cavalry, and if the unicorns didn't have humans riding on them, they would be less effective. (Assuming that unicorn biology is similar to the horse except for the horn) One single factor, however, could put unicorns into an advantage: if they would be much less fearful than horses, or even humans. Battles were not decided mechanically by a fight which lasts to the last man: armies almost always broke into a rout when losing 20-25% of their men, sometimes even much less. 

Steam locomotives, especially 20th century ones, are real marvels of engineering, more than 100 years of development led them to be much faster and more efficient than when they were first invented. This knowledge is not lost to us, so we don't have to start from scratch. Many old steam locomotives still exist in functional state with people able to maintain and operate them, either for tourism, or in reserve for emergencies. So, putting the 1930-1940's steam locomotives (the last time significant development was done in this regard) back in production should not be that difficult. But how could we improve them? One significant change (but invisible from the outside), I guess, would be the computerization of the controls, to make them simpler to operate. Driving a steam locomotive was a very difficult job, and required great wisdom. It's no wonder the word "engineer" originally meant a train driver. Even the job of the person shoveling coal required a lot of knowledge and experience, keeping track of steam pressure, temperature, humidity, the color of the smoke, to know when to shovel fuel and when to release pressure, etc. Everything was done manually, so some improvement could be done there. What else? Fuel efficiency? What could we do now what they couldn't do 70 years ago? Computer simulations to make a better shape for the boiler to improve efficiency a little? Better steel technology to resist higher pressures? Better filters to not produce that much smoke? What would visibly change as steam locomotives would be kept improving from where they were left 70 years ago? Steam turbines are more efficient then traditional steam engines, every power plant, including nuclear ones, use highly sophisticated steam turbines. However, they tried it for locomotives, and it was not very successful. 

For people to live in a desert of various ores that includes heavy metals, respiratory protection would be essential, as would be an oasis protected from dust. Any airborne heavy metal dust getting into the inhabitants lungs, or into their digestive system via contamination of water or food would lead to a short and miserable life. Airborne dust can be dealt with using respirators, which needn't be too complex - a few layers of finely woven cloth or a container of a bundle of fibres like cotton can trap dust effectively. The dust masks need to seal fairly well, so don't expect your desert dwellers to have beards - people who use respirators on a regular basis for work can gain significant exposure via beard-induced poor sealing around the mouth and nose. The problem with dust is that it gets on the food and in the water too. Water can be used to wash foodstuffs, which would probably be cooked in closed containers to keep out dust, but keeping water clean is a problem. Many toxic metal ores can dissolve in water, so if there were underground aquifers that were toxin-free, they could be sheltered to keep out dust for use as a primary water supply. Alternatively, if the only water available was contaminated, distillation could be used to remove contaminants. However, this would take energy in the form of fuel (or magic). The inhabitants would have to know which ores were toxic so that they could avoid eating any plants growing in them, since such plants would not be able to be simply washed clean, and any animals from these areas would likely be toxic too. 

One of the biggest problems (besides the ambiguity of what is regarded as killing) would be that as trying to live up to the treaty requires humans to cede an awful lot of liberties, there will be humans who resent it. even more so, there will be a lot of humans who don't believe in that "Insects are sentient" crap. Insects can telepathically communicate with some humans. Just as in real human history, gods can telepathically communicate with some humans, and some believe those humans, but others don't. All it takes is a few extremists who feel that enough is enough, and go to torch a huge anthill. Suddenly millions of people will be executed. Which will fuel people to avenge them... 

Even if not completely untranslatable, having a species with a very strange culture or mindset, or a very different sense of reality, would make their language very difficult to understand and only partially translatable, as most words would cover concepts we might completely lack. A good example for it is the Orz language: 

I guess the biggest problem would be the production of reliable ammunition. People weren't using muzzle-loaders for five centuries because they were too stupid to realize that they could reload faster if they had a cartridge instead of loose gunpowder, they just didn't have any reliable means to ignite the powder. This means you would probably need a recipe for the chemicals required for a primer and for smokeless gunpowder. Would medieval people be able to produce them without having access to modern industrial infrastructure? 

The grooves found along the sides of many bladed weapons, known as fullering, are intended to lighten and strengthen the blade. However, they are also colloquially known as 'blood gutters', though this does not reflect their primary purpose. Let us assume that we have two weapons that are identical other than the presence or absence of fullering: double-edged daggers with blades 30cm long from tip to hilt, and 5 cm wide and 1 cm thick at the hilt with a triangular profile. One of the two weapons is unfullered, the other has been fullered on each side of the blade with two triangular grooves beginning at 5mm in width and 3mm in depth, that run from the hilt to points 75% of the way along the length of the blade. Let us further suppose that we were to stab hypothetical twin human victims of average human height and mass (without respect to gender) with these blades in an identical manner, the blades penetrating directly and without any lateral broadening of the wound tract by twisting motions of the blade 25cm into the torso from behind and into the middle of a highly vascular organ such as one of the kidneys, such that the only difference between the victims was the presence or absence of the fullering of the blade. The victims can be assumed to be in identical, comfortable, indoor environments, neither hot nor cold, and for as long as they can remain conscious with these injuries, remain relatively still after being injured. The questions: 

Stanisław Lem is a very good example of an author who dedicated most of his sci-fi books to examine this very question, and created plenty of worlds inhabited by intelligent life which doesn't differ just in a few facial features from humans, but is so different from anything we've ever encountered that we might not even recognize each other as "life", much less as "intelligent". He often even gives detailed explanations about how these lifeforms could have been evolved. 

Relativistic bag of sand. At the speeds spaceships fly, anything can cause great damage, especially if it flies very fast. Just take a look at how much damage a small fleck of paint can do to current day spacecraft. A bunch of sand fired at a significant fraction of light speed will be close to impossible to detect in time, and impossible to defend against with point defenses even if detected. By giving it some spread, you can even compensate small errors in accuracy. Imagine it like a huge space shotgun. Even if the enemy spaceship somehow survives a hit, it will be stripped of sensors, weapons and engines. It would be a very potent weapon especially at the few light-seconds range (Earth - Moon distance), but very dangerous even at much longer ranges, where the target must be constantly moving in random patterns to avoid it. Within the few light-seconds range, not even that would save the target, as its mass would prevent it from moving enough to avoid getting hit.
