Eat like a horse if you're focusing on strength gains First, how do you know how much is enough? If you eat everything in sight, you know you're doing what you can to give your body enough fuel. If you lift heavy and eat light, you might be leaving strength gains on the table. Fine-tuning caloric intake is hard, and inevitably involves missing out on strength increases that your lifting already earned you. Secondly, having a significant surfeit of calories--enough to gain fat as well as muscle--may cause muscle growth at a higher rate than if one tries to put on all or mostly muscle. The way I understood this was that having more than enough gives the body carte blanche to really grow. (I believe this is in one of Rip's articles or forum posts, but can't find the reference.) Pure strength gain versus other goals However, there are good reasons not to do an all-out mass-and-strength gain program. Maybe you're in a weight class sport, or care more about body composition than strength gain, or you want to maintain conditioning while progressing more slowly with strength. 

I currently train them by just from a standing position going up onto the tips of my toes. Some variations I did were holding weights at the same time or doing one leg at a time which improves balance too. However it's come to my attention that there are two main groups in the calves and that tip toe exercise I've been doing only works one of them. I've read that for the other one your leg needs to be bent like in a sitting position. All the sites I saw showed exercises on this machine where you would sit and lift up a weight on your knees. What can I do at home to workout the other part of my calves. I've tried placing dumbbells on my knees but not only is this uncomfortable but I don't feel tired from this. I don't think I'm getting much benefit from it. What exercises can I do to train this other muscle group? 

I'm partial to Tom Kurz' Science of Sports Training. Supertraining is well spoken of. Part of the problem you'll run into is that this is an incredibly broad topic that can span multiple distinct research disciplines. Going from the high level overview down to the biochemistry will take a long time if you're just looking to put together a workout program. The CDC physical activity recommendations and similar WHO recommendations are a good place to start for the skeleton of workout programming. I'd start from there and fill in the blanks with topic-specific books like Rippetoe & Kilgore's Practical Programming. 

You need to do dips. Start with dips on parallel bars and progress to ring dips. Push-ups aren't specific practice for the pushing motion of the muscle-up. 

I would like to increase my flexibility. Not necessarily every single part of my body but I would like to hit most if not all areas. I would like a set of several exercises that I can do one day or over several days for basically the rest of my life, to constantly improve my flexibility. What is the simplest, most necessary/important/commonly used(as in the muscle's flexibility is needed commonly in real life situations, not the stretch itself is commonly used) set of stretches that I could do to increase full body flexibility? 

Firstly I would suggest going very easy for a while, for the same reason you stopped for over a year when your gym closed for a month. You lost the habit of exercising every week. You need to get that back by having a routine even if it's not very much weight or very intense or whatever. Since your goals are purely to lose weight and you're not worried about maintaining muscle mass or strength I would recommend doing HIIT combined with a caloric deficit diet instead of a strength program like stronglifts. Even cardio would be better for your goals than lifting. 

Due to my new job, which is 9 hours of sitting and staring at the computer from 10 AM to 7PM I am going to miss my usual 5 PM gym workout. I want to get started with StrongLift 5*5 again but do it in the morning for two days. Tuesday and Thursday 7.30 to 8.30 AM and Saturday 5 to 6 PM. Because I haven't done a workout in the mornings before I'd like to know about correct eating in the morning before and after workout, plus any additional tips you guys want to share. Thanks. 

I got my form checked by a trainer today, he made a couple of good points: 1- Don't arch your lower back too much while coming down. I looked up online, and this article kind of supports it, although I have no back pain right now, increasing the weights may cause it in future. How can I maintain a neutral spine throughout? There is no uneven loading, and I am not leaning forward, but I compared my form with his on the mirror, what I noticed was he was a bit straighter than me. I will try the big breath technique next time though. 2- Keep a slight bend on your knees when you come up, or it will cause excess load on the knees. Is that even true? 3- Your elbows are coming back, this may be the cause of pain, though I have noticed my right elbow is a bit forward than the left elbow. How do I improve this? Right now I am using a medium grip with elbows pushing down and forward (but I goes away when I squat). Looking forward to improving my form on the next workout, all your suggestions are welcome. 

Hypertrophy means that your muscles are bigger, but does this mean that they don't perform better or worse than smaller muscles? Is it really possible for hypertrophy of the muscles to have no functional effects? Would you gain at least some strength? Are there any negative functional effects? I've heard that bigger muscles makes you less flexible, is this true? So what are the functional effects both positive and negative of hypertrophy? 

So to answer your question, yes it is possible to have gained 25kg in six months however the chances of gaining 25kg of muscle is impossible. Over the course of their lifetime, maybe but not six months. The other weight can possibly be attributed to fat. If you had measured their body fat percentage before and after you would be able to see how much was fat and how much was lean mass. 

What would be some good additional exercises to do at the gym for 2 days a week with 7 days of tennis? Objective - Improve strength, mobility and endurance. (Not particularly in this order) I am pretty familiar with StrongLifts 5*5, which I have been following before this, but am afraid it has to stop now (don't have enough time). My routine, which I am aiming to follow is, 7 days tennis, Saturday Sunday gym, mainly compound movements like, squats (with lesser weight), overhead press, deadlift, bench press, pull ups, seated row/weight pull ups(that machine which has a rod). Please help me refine this plan. About me: 7-8 hours of sitting job, weight 60 Kgs, height 180 cm, 23 years old. Thanks a lot! :) 

I believe that the below exercises are the minimum to train the most amount of muscles that also requires minimal equipment: 

Firstly you need to be able to do pull ups and chest dips. To train for muscle ups you will need to do lots of both of those two exercises. Pull ups and chest dips account for most of the muscle up move however the most difficult part of a muscle up is the transition. False grip training is highly recommended to improve the transition part of a muscle up. So incorporate false grip hangs and false grip pull ups. Aside from that, all you can do is the full muscle up move but with assistance, the same as when you probably first started doing pull ups; rest your legs on a stool or something to take some of the weight. Do the move quickly with a bit of a jump at the start. Go to the top of the move and then slowly go down to a hang. 

There are many ways to press a weight overhead. What you describe are a (1) a specific trick used in several overhead press styles, called a 'lay back' or a 'lumbar tilt' (it's unclear from your description which you're using) and (2) a strict military press: 

Push your knees out. Without a proper video form check it's impossible to really diagnose what's going on, but it may be that your knees are collapsing in and thereby impinging your hip. You need to go as deep as the book describes, which is defined objectively and specifically as when the crease of your hip is lower than the top of your knee, as in the left-side figure here: 

While on a heavy lifting program, those who are underweight and want to get bigger need to eat a large amount of food. One of the best ways to make sure that one gets enough calories each day is to drink a gallon of milk in addition to three large meals. To answer your questions individually: 

But what would you do if your final goal was two of them? Say you wanted to get a lot of strength as well as endurance for example. How would you proceed? Would you follow the graphs recommendations for one day or week on one goal and then the next week is for the other goal? Would you average out the variables? Would you spend several months on one and then the other? What would you do? 

It's the pulling exercise that I'm mainly concerned about, I'm doing dead lift as I read it somewhere but after doing it for the first time I felt like the dead lift was more of a legs exercise. Is it an appropriate exercise to fill the "pull" slot in my workout? What would be a pull exercise that I could use instead if deadlift does not meet the pull criteria? 

Awareness The first step is to discover the sensation of a flat back, of firing your lower back muscles, of arching your back, and of keeping or losing your back arch while the hips move. Practice "supermans" on the floor, lifting your legs and chest off the ground. Get into what you think is proper position, then feel with your hand or look in a mirror. Reinforce this sensation using Romanian deadlifts and by squatting while holding a dowel or broomstick up and down your back, touching your sacrum, between your shoulderblades, and the back of your head. Periodic review Once you've achieved sensation of proper back position, it's important to get occasional feedback on how your proprioception is doing. I'll ask a knowledgeable lifter to take a look at my deadlift (or clean or squat) and let me know how my back arch looks. I'll also set up a camera with a tripod and see how it looks to me.
