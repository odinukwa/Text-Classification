So there is nothing wrong in also teaching "animals" under humans. Of course, since it is possible danger and not pleasant, there is no duty in do such and just teach if they show some basic characters of what is called a human being (like respect, patient, generosity, felling obligate, and virtue). If one, on the other side, desires to get animals become humans, thinking all have such as a Buddha-Nature, he/she is not only a fool, but increases by sacrifies into the desert wrong view and suffering is bound to it naturally, being attached to animals, often just a matter of time to addopt the animals way. Being joyful and gladen if teaching and listening to * wuff *. In regard of being born as an animal, even if not just a common animal, but one with certain merits, think on pets, one is incapable to grow into the Dhamma, e.g. realize the four Noble Truth. Such is pointed out in the story of the Naga for example: 

...makes one being not so much in danger of unbenefical states to gain and then just taken on this, act-ually walk for beyound. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial use or other lower wordily gains by ways of exchange or trade] 

As Upasak inb4dead told. There are no conditions for Nibbana. Nibbana is unconditioned. To possible reach the Unconditioned, one needs to hold on, put into, increase the conditions to let go of them. One needs to have upanissaya (strong conditions) and give into strong condition causes (upanissayapaccayena). Of which causes are conductive and which not, how to foster, increase, develop... conductive causes, all of that is what the whole teaching are about. The Essence of the Dhamma might be useful, since the Unconditioned is not to be reached without giving conditions to attain.

For every goal one needs to have strong desire for it. The question is just: what brings long terme happiness so that it is worthy to grasp after. But not only the goal it self but also the means to reach it are importand. If one desires well-being but uses harmful and addicting things to reach it, he/she will get troubled by harm and addiction him/herself as well. That is why virtue and right livelihood are so importand. Once having a livelihood that does not involve harm, it's easier to walk, remorse-less. If one makes his/her live on using and harming others, or by increasing their greed and desire, than it has backwards in same ways. So in regard of livelihood, especially, it's good if having a smooth and troubleless kind. So once bigger and more far goals are clear, just focus on the means, on one step by the other and improve you ways of living and livelihood according the remorseless reqirements. If it is possible to combine with ones pasion in skills, fine. If not, better to take on the harder way but sleep fine. At least, since mentioned art, it can be very addictive and busy the mind day and night with less place to find a rest. It's of course also good to listen to and respect ones parents, and if their wishes are not harmful and against a remorseless life, what should be the problem in following it? At least, since surely not so occupied, they might think more practical and reasonable. But it the new idea might give ways for a better livelihood, than it can be explained and argued in this way. At least it's a good chance to give ones parent something back, in talking and teaching on Dhamma, generosity, moral and virtue. So if taking very sober, it might be not the biggest problem to make your best decision on it. Best wishes to take and see the right thing to do for long term happiness.

My person is not sure about "on that very day" and sees the "seven days", mentioned in the Suttas more resasonable. As quoted by Upasaka Saptha Visuddhi in the anicent discussion, the relations within a householder-life, the regards are to weak to supporting, now having perfect virtue, since it's not likely that he may be proper offered what is required to support further life. My person is also not sure about the saying "must join the order" in a formal sense, but of cause lead a live similar in it's way. Yet it might be "hard" to even get such as robe and bowl, not to speak of being far from people not used, not rejoicing, on special beggars. It might be that one lives in association with virtuous people who might recognice or know or it might be, that one lives on ten precepts, yet wearing white, since a longer, used to proper live on alms. How ever, this things are very rare and dhammata, usually, seven days without support might mark the end of the bodies abilities. 

So generally this phenomena, in all it's small and larger appearances, not at least by such so guided practice and teachings, will increase. And (provoking), where should all the trees have gone to in this days :-) Such as classical taught Zen-ways in modern times, put away of all thinking, is a good chance to reach the asanna states by zazen. Not being aware of anything, one might believe "coming and going, from and to emptiness"

It's a common missinterpretation that Ghandi-like approaches, Mahātmā (Maha Atma, "great Ego, great selfishness"), of kind of passive aggressivism goes allong with the good teachings of the Buddha. For a large he used affliction to "force" people, like with his well known extortion by hunger strike. It's merely unattentive to put exortions and alike under non-violent. Non-violence has it's root in the mind, has being impotent (for becoming and desire) as case. When one acts with big desire, big potence, yet cover one self with the cloak of non-violence one might become the hero of fools, playing with their affections. Another outwardly indication, as a result if one has rightly developed metta one might prove: 

Affirming the Truths of the Heart, bias or taking a stand is endless wandering on. Fools will always just work on their own destructiin and not easy could they be helped. Generally, this essays are a good help for understanding: "Wisdom over Justice" and "Justice vs. Skillfulness" but require some amount of having cleansed one mind a little already to do not quick fall into papanca (objectification, identification, with its endless expansions and beark apparts) again. 

It's worthy to think about in how far one is still just another Bodhisattva, no matter which wisdom or vehicle one calaims to be ones own... ;-) It's always very tricky to like to stay in the same boot, isn't it? And then a sublime smile on ones smart account might fade to getting disenchanted in regard of ones smart found, doesn't it? Well then, if not, take another turn, Boddhisattva to become one seeking maybe just after Awakening, a Bodhisatta! Or should you be called a healed one, doctor for trade and livelihood?
