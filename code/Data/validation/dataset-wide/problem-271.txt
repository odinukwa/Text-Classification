As the title says: How can a warehouse be secured to the point of highest possible security within a 16th century setting? The warehouse is located at a harbor and roughly 50 meters in length and 15 in width. It's owned by a really wealthy merchant and stores pretty much anything but weapons. There are other warehouses next to it, but the security of these don't matter for this question, as they are owned by other people. There are roughly three meters between two warehouse. The warehouse has ten guards as of now, who are personally chosen and paid by the owner. There is also some kind of harbor watch patrolling the harbor in general. These two groups are unrelated with each other, but cooperate, if needed. All of them are forbidden to kill intruders or to hurt them more than needed to arrest them. You can build whatever you like into the warehouse in order to tighten the security, but most of the space should be used for goods, as it is a warehouse after all. Given these circumstances, how can it be further secured to an extent, where it becomes basically impossible to successfully break in and escape? Just to make sure: This question is about thiefs, not about organized assaults by masses of armed fighters. 

A simple reason for it to be build on Venus would be the distance to the sun. I would imagine a city, with the size of an island or metropolis, with thousands if not millions of life ensuring mechanisms, that constantly surfs the atmosphere, requires A LOT of energy. You could say the source for this is sunlight and the city requires such an amount of this, that Venus was the best choice. 

That's the biggest deal right here. Just take the Hercules vs Hydra approach from the Disney movie. Send someone inside his stomach, killing him from within. Take something sharp and damage his organs. Inner bleedings will do the rest, even if it may take a few hours... or days... or weeks... (dunno, it's your dragon, you decide) But hey, he's pretty sure to die. Edit: Another approach: What about his eyes? With his size his eyes would most likely be a good target and possibly a huge weakpoint. It's up to you wether 1880s revolver can pierce it or not, but if they'd do, the dragon is doomed to die, as he's not used to be blind, thus unable to find/hunt enough food. 

If gods exist in your setting, then they are likely to be the ones who "created" humanity... Just to introduce them to millions of ways to die painfully or unreasonable. The irony is strong within them and so is their sense of humour. 

If all of the gods want their respective followers / religions to live in peace, they have to obey, right? 

You can't wage war without weapons and consumables like food and water. Make them rare / hard to acquire and you should be fine, as they have other problems as war... This on the over side could also lead to war. "They have something we need. Let's take it with force." If you prefer this way, than just do the opposite. Flood your world with ressources. 

Let your New gods give humanity access to said magic. They will kill themself in a bunch of years, without any further input... If not in mere months. 

ADS stated the more obvious stuff, so I'm going to answer something more... specific: Various poisons You know... if some nobles wanted to get rid of someone, without a doctor figuring out the source of the death and thus being unable to point to said noble as the killer. Assassin's sure are interested in some new poisons to 'play' with. Jungles have plenty of this stuff, if you know where to look for it. 

Give them as much resources as they need and make the individuals appearances as similiar to each other as possible. Most conflicts erupt, because someone is in dire need of something he can't afford or because they fear what the 'others' could do to them. It's a real shame, but many people, even nowadays, fear people from other countries, just because they look different. "They look different, so they act different. Different means worse and thus dangerous, right?" 

Hidden Layer Just say a rune consists of two layers. One, that uniquely identifies the spell as what it is and that can easily be understand by everyone and another hidden layer, that does the actual work. You compared it to program code. It's the same mechanic. Image the visible layer as button. 

tend to give them decades of lifetime after their transformation. So food and water will be your biggest problems. Starvation will kill your survivors. Especially because these castles hadn't todays methods of food preservation. But stay relaxed, if your guys are lucky enough to find a full food storage all for themself, I'll give them about two years or so. As it is your world, you can let your zombies rot away in that time. 

Well yes, a machine like this is plausible. Others have stories about machines traveling to other starsystems, so I don't see why a "simple" thing like a storm generating machine would be unbelievable, if it is reasoned by future / further advanced technology than currently available. But in order to defend the island, I would imagine it to be pretty ineffective. Firstly, generating a storm needs time. If it just pops up out of nowhere it will be noticed, thus questioned, thus be looked into. As soon as this happens, more and more people will get aware of it and at some point swarm the place, as mankind is fixed on the idea of exploring and explaining everything. As a result you get exactly the opposite of what you've tried to achieve. Secondly, even if the island owner is okay with the first one, a storm isn't able of defending at all. You would have to make sure, that the storm (or the thunder within) hits absolutely everyone / -thing approaching it. You could say something like shooting small balls of something, which are highly responding the the thunder, thus luring the thunder into following it, at the intruders. But then again, we already have machines hitting a speed of more than 2000 mph according to this wikipedia article. I doubt a thunder storm would reliably hit all of these things, if they'd raid the place. And even if so, they could still go the underwater way, sending submarine to the island... Remember, it IS an island, thus in the middle of massive bodies of water. And, as already mentioned in the comments of the original post, we already have satellites in the orbit, which should easily be able to spot every open building on the island. 

... exists. Send him, he'll handle the old Gods. Answer two.1: A. C. A. C.'s comment on the OP: Kill all of humanity and let Life create a new sentient species for them. Answer two.2: Kill a good amount of humanity, so that the life force of the remaining humans isn't enough for the old ones. Answer three: Let your new Gods only kill the priests. If the priests aren't protected by their gods, why should the rest of humanity still prey to them, if the evidently 'stronger' ones are right in front of them? Answer four.1: Let Life-deity and/or energy-goddess enhance some people, which worship them. This would put the believers of the New ones above the ones of the old gods. Answer four.2: Let Life-deity and Matter/Energie-goddess create an utopia somewhere, inviting people to them. "Look folks, our Realm is far superior to your current location." Answer five: Fate comes from a realm, where they already fight the angels. Let him call for some of his friends. Answer six: Made the believer of the old gods aware, just how much these gods suppresses them. With all the killing the non-believers and asking for sacrifices thingy. New ones neither need, nor want this from them. Answer seven: Fate is a human, right? Let him promise the common people to make some of them gods as well, if they serve him well. Up to you, if he really does that or not. Answer eight: 

Everybody knows exactly what happens by using it, but "nobody" can copy it without some knowledge of the algorithm behind it, which would be a hidden layer in your case. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Invisible ink Same as above, only with a second, invisible ink on the same layer. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Example: Image you want to summon a demon. The Pentagon is a well known symbol often refered to it. So, what everyone can see/read is a pentagon with some more symbols to further clarify which demon the user is about to summon. But if you copy it 1:1 it won't work, because something is invisible and couldn't be copied. In this case a simple circle around the Pentagon, hidden on a second layer or with invisible ink. 

As there already are a bunch of answers covering the 'healing' of the opponent, I'll take another route than the others: Self-Enhancement Healing Magic can potentially fix broken bones and even recover them. Use this to 'recover' the mage's bones to an extent, which can already be considered as enhancement. Make his knuckles or his complete arm several times bigger, harder, more resistable and so on. Let him use his magic to boost his strength or adrenaline to a maximum and then let him attack. Should be able to crush an enemy's defense and kill him in one punch. 

Bad (or non-existing) Gravity actually is a thing. Thousands of years of evolution build the human body to be best suited for some gravity. While we are very well able to survive in a space harbor, it takes it toll on the body. 

Gravity You can say, that, if you're to close to a planet, your ship is under the influence of the gravity of said planet and accelerating to light speed would throw the ship off the course to an degree, that the ship may even crash into an other planet, unable to slow down fast enough. 

Okay, only slow and unorganized zombies: Sure, they can survive. These castles were able to defend against armies of organized soldiers, why would they fall to some zombies? But while they can't overthrow you, they can besiege you. And 

Let him take some medicine/drugs that would stop his heart. If he's immortal it won't work. (Or it does, but he just continues doing his stuff nethertheless) If he isn't, a doctor can revive him shortly after that with a defibrillator. Just like it is shown in this trailer of the upcoming movie "Flatliners": 

What did they die for? Did they show braveness for entering a battle, where they have nothing to gain but their life to lose? All you end up with is a far smaller army and a kingdom, where (a lot? of) young men die in vain. Edit: And with masses of dead people, conflicts will erupt. Sure, the province that achieve victory gains honour, but how does honour feed them in the winter? What do the defeated provinces gain for participating? They lost valueable men and got nothing in exchange. Do this long enough, and your kingdom will start to crumble from within. 

The easiest one would be overpopulation on earth. Yes, it's simple as that. It's already a thing to consider at our very time, and your world plays 

...no. It makes no sense that the subjugated neighbours suddenly become stronger than your close-to-all-mighty kingdom out of nowhere in the first place. Not only are they already defeated and probably have less, if any, soldiers, they were weaker to begin with. It would be rather hard to assemble an army strong enough to defeat Toren, without them noticing it. I mean, they rule the whole place, so they should have their informers everywhere, right? And I fail to understand, why a death in a training battle 

First question: Yes, swords could be better, if the animal shows different behaviors depending on the distance between it and the human. It could go into an all-defense mode, if said distance is bigger than his own attack range, rendering guns and bullets useless, as they can't get through its scales or whatever. But as soon as you come close enough it will attack you, while it ignores his defense. I imagine swords to be the better weapon for your own defense, before you strike and kill the prey with it. Second question: Yes, swords can be more effective, if the shield has limited duration on constant attacks. Just say the shield can fully recover in the short amount of time between two bullets, but breaks under constant pressure of a sword. 

Availability River travel is rather limited. Limited to the space of the available meanings for transportation across said Rivers. So if masses of people have to be moved, a tunnel would enable more of them to do so at the same time. Ships, or whatever else can be used for river travel, also force people to wait for them, to travel in groups and to have a person with you, who is able to control them. A tunnel doesn't. Tradition You have dwarves. Dwarves have always lived inside of tunnel and cave systems. (At least in all the stories I've heard/seen/read about them so far). They probably just feel more comfortable with traveling through tunnels. So let them. 

Would a mage with the ability to control roughly 3000 insects at once be able to kill roughly a 1000 knights charging at him with the intention to kill him? If so, which insects would be suited to do so? Would be awesome to get 3 or more at once, for the sake of diversity. I'm asking for insects, which really exist in reallife, so no enhanced fantasy novel stuff. And it doesn't matter, if your chosen insects don't naturally life in the same area. (Knights don't own magic or have any stuff that didn't exists in the medieval pre-gunpowder ages. They also only wield sword and shield, so no ranged weapons.)
