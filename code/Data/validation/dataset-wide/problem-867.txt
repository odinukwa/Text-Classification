Only a small percentage of the sun's light is in that range. 8%-10% of the sun's light is in the UV range, but maybe only 1%-2% in the upper UV3 range of 160 NM. (Source) The same Wiki article, using Saturn as a guide, Saturn receives between 13.4 and 16.7 Watts per square meter (Source), so figure an estimate of 15 watts per square meter total solar energy, 1%-2% of that strong enough to pull a hydrogen atom off Methane, so 0.15 - 0.3 watts per square meter. That might not sound like much, but on a moon the size of titan, that's a lot of square meters so the low wattage isn't a big deal. That's a peak estimate though as some of the hydrogen would recombine with the CH3 it split from, some energy would likely be converted to heat, and perhaps the biggest problem, mentioned in the article above, a share of the hydrogen, perhaps the lion's share would simply be lost off the planet. 

Both would be stable. A single moon orbiting a planet is generally stable provided it's comfortably inside the true region of stability, in the Hill Sphere and provided that it's not so large that tidal forces become a stability issue or not so close that it dips inside the roche limit and might break apart. The only way you might run into instability in your scenarios, is if you have the smaller moon very close, inside the Geosynchronous orbital distance, where the Moon would move ahead of the tidal bulge it creates and that would cause the Moon to be drawn towards the planet and in time, crash into it, similar to how Phobos is expected to crash into/break into a ring system around Mars. As the planet moves away from the sun it's stable region expands. The geosynchronous orbit is unrelated to the sun, that's between the masses of the planet and moon only, but as long as your moon is orbiting between geosynchronous orbit and inside the stable region of the hill sphere, it should be fine. (unless you give the planet or moons a retrograde rotation, then you need to re-examine the long term tidal effects). For most orbits, the planet rotates ahead of the Moon so the tidal bulge pushes the Moon slowly outwards, but this effect gets weaker as the Moon gets further, so it's generally long term stable over billions of years, unless the planet is very close to the sun and it has a tiny hill-sphere. Only two well known moons in our solar-system orbit ahead of their tidal bulges that leads to orbital decay (a handful of tiny captured moons do too, but those are so small and their tidal forces are largely irrelevant). Only Phobos and Neptune's wrong way moon Triton orbit ahead of their tidal bulges, resulting in them being pulled towards their planets, not pushed away. Triton is sufficiently distant that it's timing to crash into/break into a ring system around Neptune is billions of years off. All the other moons, for tidal reasons, should be moving away from their planets, mostly very very gradually. The 4 Jovian moons, however, are more complicated as Jupiter has a gonzo magnetic field, a magnetosphere that's almost wind like and it's moons are tidally locked to each other and it's innermost moon is losing mass to Jupiter's magnetosphere - so . . . all bets are off when it comes to Jupiter's 4 inner moons. 2 or more large moons can sometimes interact with each other, creating some instability. One moon systems are, more often than not, long term stable. (too long?) 

I don't know if this will be closed as too general, but I think there's a fun question in here about galaxy mapping. The trick is to have a good map of the galaxy. We can't see large sections of the Milky way, so we might have a better map of Andromeda than the Milky way overall from our perspective. And yes, there are landmarks. Pioneer and Voyager used Pulsars as landmarks in a diagram on their plaques. 

You're correct, if it's visible in London at sunrise, it's visible east of London earlier. Basically everywhere on Earth where you see the sun, you're seeing the same side of the sun. The sun is in different parts of the sky but we all see the same side of the sun, so, unless there's clouds blocking the view, everyone east of London, still should have seen what they saw. That raises the question, how long was the object visibly affecting the sun because it couldn't have been long or word would have spread. The object appears in that image to be about one solar radii distance from the Sun's surface, assuming the angle is somewhat straight on, not viewed sideways, then we can estimate it's distance from the sun to be about 1 solar radii or 700,000 km. The black dot is also quite small, maybe planet size, certainly smaller than Jupiter (which is 1/10th the diameter of the Sun), it appears larger than Earth (1/100th the diameter of the sun) and that would make it too large to be a black hole or neutron star, but perhaps a white dwarf, super earth, mini gas giant planet or planetary core fragment. There's a fair bit of wiggle room in there. The solar gravity, basically the escape velocity in reverse would have added about 430 km/s to whatever initial velocity relative to the sun that the object had as it approached the solar-system. Most near-by exo-solar system objects have a relative velocity to the sun in the 1s or 10s of km/s, at least for those objects that orbit in the same direction through the milkyway, but hyper accelerated objects can reach into the 100s of kms per second relative to the Sun. If that was a hyper-accelerated object approaching from the opposite side of the sun than the Earth, it's possible that it would be both difficult to see, and that it approached the solar-system very quickly. The slower something moves, the more time there is to see it and it's gravitational influence, but a hyper-velocity, behind the sun approach might work, either impacting or making a close pass by the sun. Assuming that object is close to the sun, which it appears to be, even at hyper velocity, to the naked eye, it would appear largely still. If we give this object a relative velocity to the sun of lets say 700-1000 km/s. It would still take, from our perspective, 700-1,000 seconds (12-16 minutes), to travel one solar radii or 1/4 of 1 degree across the sky. That, in theory, means that it might have only been visible for 12-16 minutes, or less if it was traveling faster. That's a short enough time-frame that the cops could have chased their suspect unaware of the images that began flooding the internet. A 12-16 minutes actually works and is theoretically possible, if hugely improbable. 

Yes, a little, but not enough to matter. Magnets can spin other magnets. Think of magnets as a bar magnet with a north and a south, and you can think of them as linear not spherical if that helps with the imagery, because in a sense, they are linear with a distinct North and South magnetic pole. 

Just to clarify, inner planets usually refers to Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. But in relation to your question, the "inner" planets are just Mercury and Venus and the outer planets are Mars and out, because the +1 / -1 formula is in relation to whether the Earth is passing the planet as it orbits the sun or being passed by the planet. Someone else can do the math if they like, the gist is explained here. Because it's the motion relative to the stars in the background that you're tracking, anything that orbits closer to the sun and faster than Earth would move in a different direction and require a different formula than orbits further out and slower. If your asteroid remains outside the Earth's orbit, then it would obey the outer planet formula. If your asteroid is an Earth crosser, which isn't uncommon, then it would have a different type of orbital period that would follow neither formula, and I'm not sure what formula would apply for an earth-crossing asteroid.
