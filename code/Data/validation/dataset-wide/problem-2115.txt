How else are people going to get back to you? Consider the opposite, your resume contains no contact information whatsoever. HR reads it, thinks "wow, we'd like to talk to that bloke", then find they can't contact you. Missed opportunity. Or more likely they'll just throw it away because they think you've something to hide about your condition, like maybe you're in prison or living in a homeless shelter while applying for a responsible position where you have to have a clean record. 

But in 20 years in the industry, and years before as a student and hobbyist, I've only encountered that I think twice. That's not to say I've never run into bugs in compilers, libraries, or tools. But in decades I've only once or twice encountered one where we couldn't work around the bug without an investment that would be higher than the cost of switching to another tool(set). 

I was writing a motivation letter for an internship and showed it to a friend who responded “You're actually not saying what you want.” He was in the opinion that I should say what I want to do- except that I have three slight issues with this: 

Dilemma For a short internship, I'm wondering if it's worth the trouble to do the stuff just for this company and loosing ownership over it afterwards. 

Is it unethical to go with personal development of this idea and then to sell it back to them? (although perhaps give it to them for some time span for free perhaps or similar benefit, but I retain ownership over it) Field: Engineering, Central Europe 

I had an interview last week for a 10-week internship. Went OK, just needs clearance from his boss. Internship was paid as much as the longer internships, around 60% of an average low monthly salary in the country. Today I get the advice from a person who does a fair bit of business that I should call them up again and offer to do it for free. Since the internship is so short, they are probably actually going to run a financial loss on me considering medical insurance and other costs. Offering to do it for free will improve my chances and eliminate hesitation. Considerations: 

With my experience, I am terrible at reading people, to see if they are open to casual talk for a while, or if they don't want their work to be interrupted, so I don't know when to start chatting with them. Also, my own life isn't very interesting to talk about, as I don't go out on a typical weekend. I don't want to start talking "just because". I am good at staying focused on my own work all time, but usually when I talk I tend to catch people at a bad time (they are quickly interrupted by some work-related order). And at work there are conversations that can be over 15 minutes long. This is not a problem for me in non-work related situations, such as a friendly outing or a party, because I know people want to talk. But at work I either risk being labeled a shut-in or a guy who slacks off too much. How do I balance it? How do I know when to start/finish a chat, and make it sound natural without being forced or contrived? 

I'd go one over on the others and say it's vital that you mention it. It's something that will seriously impact your work performance, maybe even your ability to work at all. Not mentioning it may be seen as hiding a condition that makes you incapable of doing your job during the interview process, which at least here is reason for summary dismissal and possibly lawsuits for damages. Given that you can reasonably suspect the condition will last for a few weeks only, if you communicate that clearly the company may decide to let you start after that time, or to assign you different duties for those weeks (tbh, unless you're going to be using public transport for your commute I'd advise you to not even want to travel during those weeks, driving a car or bike with a hand that's seriously restricted is dangerous and if you get into an accident may lead to criminal charges against you). 

I've just joined a company as an intern making Widgets as one of few foreigners. As part of this, I read some training material used in courses that customers buy for the company's products and discovered that substantial parts of it were written in very poor English. I'm not native but I found mistakes all over the place and cringed at the bad structure. I passed by the higher boss who oversees my team as well as the training department. I offered to correct it; he appreciated the gesture. The training department didn't seem too interested or helpful but were like 'oh sure, go ahead'. Now I'm concerned I've embarrassed the department in question having sent in the corrections: 

I've realized that they probably didn't overly appreciate getting corrected by the new intern. Should I do anything to seem helpful rather than just obtrusive and superior? I suspect that I might have to do more work with the department in question. 

Quite simple. If you already have 10 applications running and are in the last stages of negotiating a potential contract, there's less opportunity there for them (and they'll have to take care to not send your resume to the companies you're already talking to or have talked to recently too of course). It's also a means to gauge how serious you are. 

So should you accept that compressed deadline? That would depend on whether you think you can complete the work required within that compressed deadline or not. If you can, by all means accept it. If you're in doubt, don't or at least voice your concerns and ask if they can select a list of capabilities and features that the current plan calls to be implemented that will become optional (iow, aren't required to be implemented in the time you'll have available, but will be done if you've time to spare at the end). 

I'm not in the position to direct people, but I think that this stuff was unacceptable and feel a bit of personal interest of maintaining the company's professional image. Industry: Engineering, Europe Addition: I've been respectful/soft in all communication. 

I'm not experienced and would be happy to see any part of their work. I could (literally) go wiring avionics, inspecting fan blades or riveting skin panels and would be satisfied. To compound #1, I'm a bit late into this, so I am not in the position to be picky. Several of the companies are cold-calls with no 'official' positions listed. 

Background I just started an internship and while I'm enjoying myself I've spotted a few areas where efficiency and productivity could be improved. I am also not very busy (read: overqualified and bored) so it would be nice to see if I could develop a product to help solve it. Here's the hitch: I've just ended my first week and I'm only at the company for another 2 1/2 months. Then I'm back to university. Facts (Just since people are questioning implementation, I'm not too concerned about that bit myself. Just wondering about the ethics bit) 

You would ideally title yourself as a software developer or software engineer. In your case, you have experience with back-end languages and frameworks which, in some companies put you squarely in programming the back-end of websites, far removed from the design. Other places would have you using a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP and some frameworks, bridging the contexts of design and function. The degree of specialization often depends on the company size. Website/graphic design is concerned with the presentation and organization of information in the medium. In a perfect world, having an expertise in graphic design would carry over well into website design, but website design comes with its own idiosyncrasies and rules for good practices. So those designers have to understand the technical requirements and limitations for design for an online medium. 

I have an unusual problem in finding work. I have been in many interviews (over 10 in the past year), but none of them produced any job offers. However, the employers I've interviewed with are impressed by my resume and ability to solve the problems given to show that I would be productive. This leads me to find an observation for most jobs that I apply to (mainly a hard-skills technical job). Everyone needs soft skills to survive the interview process. But for those more inclined for technical work, once the job is held, these soft skills are suddenly not as important or used with the same sense of urgency, or at least they're not the same type of communication skills. They feel underused in the job compared to the interview. As an example, I do not know how to translate my ability to communicate well with co-workers on a long project into the ability to convincing interviewers and play the salesman for saying why I should get the job. Speaking to an interviewer to me feels a lot different and more difficult than speaking to a team member to discuss project goals. I consider then different kinds of communication skills. I probably don't know how make them work at an interview, so here is where I want improvement on.
