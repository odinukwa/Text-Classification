Since the headset bearings tend to be always around the same position while riding (because the headset does not spin, except for those performing barspins), and we rarely disassemble them, sometimes the spheres create depressions on the bearing tracks. This creates a "stable" position when the front wheel is pointing straight ahead, but sometimes this self-centering is to another (non-straight) position. To check this problem, lift the bike from the top tube in normal riding position, and try to gently take the handlebar slightly away from this position. If the bike tends to "self align", the most probable cause is this "marked" headset. Fully disassemble and clean the bearings to perform a visual inspection is the only way to be 100% sure. To solve the problem, these sequential steps should be taken. If the former step didn't solve, go on to the next: 

I cannot tell about other models, but it seems to me that they've seen a lot of improvement in the last few years, the greatest one being the abandonment of halogen bulbs (argh!). Hope this helps! 

As others have pointed, there are some independent factors to consider when the bike is to be sold (or bought). I think mileage is not the most important since, as mikes has written, you can ride a lot while taking care, or can almost never ride while the bike rots in a basement. Now for condition, I think painting is a very valued item in a bike, not only for it's direct show factor, but also because, usually, bikes with lots of scratches possibly had other types of misuse. Another important factor, although not so visible one, is the stress to which the parts have been submitted. For a rigid mountainbike, for exemple, use in harsh trails or roads create stresses that might induce fatigue o frame, fork, handlebars and crank arms (mostly), overload bearings, and stress rims and spokes. Again, by visual analysis one can have a rough measure of the "stress condition" of the bike. In the other hand, road bikes usually get less dirt, but can get a lot of abuse, for exemple, by riding rough roads with superinflated tires. At last, one almost invisible factor is "has the bike suffered a crash?". A violent one could induce micro-cracks that would only show negative results much time later, even if there is no visible damage. As to your question, I think the trainer miles souldn't count, since they're mileage on very controlled conditions, and could only affect drivetrain, being mostly useful for maintainence schedule, and for personal training purposes. Hope it helps. 

Some shimano models have a double-size cone, to allow use of two wrenches of different sizes, so it helps folks who have only one size of cone wrench (Shimano is rarely so considerate). I waited (and suffered) too much before buying my cone wrenches. If I knew how much a difference they make, I'd have bought them at the same time I bought the bike! 

While the most straightforward strategy would be to use a rear wheel with rim + hub brake, one for the handlebar lever and other to the friction-shifter, there are some dedicated hubs to use as drag brakes (although they are most probably cumbersome and difficult to find). One model I found on Google is the Arai Drum Brake (out of production). 

I offer an "informed decision" answer, partly based on a (slightly skeptical) medical knowledge, and from my experience as a biker. This should NOT be considered some truth emited by a potential authority-figure, neither an advice to act this or that way. On one hand, there is a very positive association between skin exposure to UV radiation (such as sunlight) and skin cancer. This association is much greater in people who have a very white skin color, such as most european/caucasian ethnic groups. It is believed that this is due to the small capacity of these skin types to produce melanin. Melanin is a dark pigment produced by skin cells to protect the cell nucleus, and its production is somewhat stimulated by sunlight exposure. Please read these very interesting paragraphs from Wikipedia: $URL$ Now, as a biker, my experience is the following: 

In any case, I'd suggest you assess the situation by yourself and alter some of these things before blaming the shoes. If it doesn't solve the problem in some weeks, look for a doctor. Hope this helps! 

And as a benefit, you keep the original stickers and paintjob protected under the reflective material (in the other hand, I could never get the refectives out, they are REALLY sticky...). This photo shows some of this reflection. In really dark conditions, it makes a lot of difference. (I'm the guy on the left): 

Sustain the vertical forces on the wheel (weight of the rider, landing, etc.); Transmit torque while accelerating (rear wheel only) and braking; 

Another possibility would be to use a (cheap?) steel clamp which you could bend open, then wrap around the frame and put the quick release through. Steel will probably not be damaged from the bending, like aluminum would. 

MORE EDIT!!!! As people correctly pointed out, you CANNOT use a chain tensioner if you use a coaster brake. So the solutions are: 

About "just threaded" vs "something else", the answer is: they are just threaded. A possible problem, though, is rust or other chemical bonding, which might make significantly difficult to take the pedal off with raw force (a friend of mine recently broke a spanner, even applying the force in the correct direction). As for the right vs. left rule, if you attach the spanner with the handle pointing upwards, you have to pull the handle to the back of the bike. 

Usually, this has to do with a combination of food intake, water intake, and sweating. From those, the one that varies the most between rides is sweating, due to climatic changes and clothing changes. Anytime you sweat a lot, the body loses electrolytes, and the hydroelectrolytic balance of the body is stressed. Then, depending on what you have eaten/drunk before the ride, and on what you eat and drink during the ride, you might experience these cramps even for normal distances and efforts. From my experience, eating/drinking LESS than you should is usually worse than eating/drinking more (provided that "drinking" excludes alcohol...). Prevention of these might be normal hidration (pure water) if sweat volume is not excessive, and some isotonic fluid or fruit/fruit-juice if sweating is significant. Hope this helps 

This constraints are fairly flexible. Your frame is a hybrid one with a OEM chainring size of 48/38/28, so most probably a 53 big ring (only 5 teeth difference) would fit without problems. All in all, there is no reliable way to anticipate if it will fit or not other than actually trying, which is relatively easy with the help of the Local Bike Shop.
