I would say that it is not automatic, only the illusions cease. Once the illusions cease, you know how to alleviate the suffering. It is assumed that one is compassionate. 

Perhaps this answer will be too personal and seem unrelated to Buddhism, and my answers are a bit simple-minded, but... I can tell you that the diets that do not add to your karma are those that take from that which gives itself freely. That means: grains, fruits, and nuts. Water, air, and sunlight, of course, are free as well. Anything else and you can't be sure that you are not taking from the path of those organisms and the contribution that they may contribute. It should be said, that if you take from fruits and nuts and grains, you give back by planting their seeds, too. With nuts, perhaps 10% of your harvest should go to planting new trees. This is how I see living the dharma. 

The benefits of celibacy are that you're not expending energy. The justification for using it is either to 1) create life or 2) to create more love than you're expending. If you can't or don't do either, for whatever reason, it IS better to remain celibate and save your life force. 

For you, the path to enlightenment begins right here. Because that's where you put your consciousness, in a Q/A site called "stackexchange". "Is this the right path" is irrelevant, because you already started by offering a piece of your own lifeforce (time, chi, whatever) into the arena. So now the universe answers back. The only question is "do you hear it" (awreness)? Aim for the highest point. It could be GOD, it could be Nature or mysticism, or it could be some virtue (Truth, Justice, etc.). When you aim for the highest point, you will either fail quickly and learn within your lifetime or achieve greatness. You have to understand what enlightenment is. On the one hand it means "to be aware" or PRESENT, on the other hand it means your burden is lighter -- because you working your karma -- paying back to those who were wronged before you. So, there are always two trajectories until you are enlightened: going upward (seeking enlightenment) or going downward (addressing your karma) so you can go further upwards. Be careful that your goal of enlightenment isn't burdened with subconscious quasi-goals such as being better than someone else (ego-driven). That is a common pitfall among Western Buddhists. As one Buddhist master remarked "after enlightenment, the mountains are mountains" -- don't get wrapped up in the goal, the journey along the way is part of the path. 

On this page and this page, you can find the "Chronology Of The Pali Canon" by Dr. Bimala Churn Law. Here, it is written in the beginning: 

The Buddha is the one who is awake, whereas the other unenlightened people are "asleep". The Buddha is not an ancestor to the future Buddhas. He is able to see into future or past through some degree of omniscience, but he is not recalling them. 

In Buddhism, there is the notion that we can use a skillful technique or theme of thinking, which is the best technique or theme of thinking that it is suited for a particular situation, for a particular purpose, to cater for a particular need. Some of these techniques may be mutually exclusive or contradictory to each other. It is just like how a master chef uses various techniques to craft the best results based on the needs. Sometimes you need to boil, sometimes you need to bake, sometimes you need to fry, sometimes you need to broil, sometimes you need to grill and sometimes you need to sautee. These techniques may appear to contradict each other, but are used at different times to achieve different results. First example: For overcoming lust (as a hindrance of sensual desire), you can use the contemplation on unattractiveness (see this question). But too much of it may lead to negative thoughts of suicide, in which case, use the mindfulness of breathing (see this answer) to counter it. Second example: The Buddha taught that not everything we experience is caused by what we did in this answer. This is the Buddha teaching anatta, so that we can let go of the self-view. 

Good for you that you're following the path. However, that first year on the path can be a sensitive time as there is a power in meditation. The Buddha talked about this power as being both a way to build your path but also a trap if you dwell in it too long. Meditation is making you more sensitive to the world around you and allowing you to perceive people in a more honest way. As you're seeing, that's not always pretty. I would suggest you practice right speech, which is a part of the Eightfold Path. Right speech forces us to be both compassionate to others while also being compassionate to ourselves. We should value ourselves as much as we value someone else. In every conversation -- in every relationship -- everyone should be equals. The Buddha said that good speech honors the other person while also honoring yourself. If someone does something you don't like, it's not honorable to tear them down with hurtful speech. However, it's also not right to dishonor yourself by saying things you don't believe just to make them feel good. You've got to live your truth while also recognizing theirs and do so in a compassionate way. It's a hard balancing act, but if you can do that, you'll find people will change the way they deal with you because you've changed the way you deal with the world. 

The answer has already been chosen, but I really wanted to provide a personal experience that may help. Back in my 20s, I was in a Buddhist temple and witnessed a woman getting stabbed and raped. I was able to help her get away, but the angst from that 5 minute event haunted me for years. I would wake up in sweats and even get into fights with abusive men simply because I was still so angry. What I finally did was go into deep meditation and picture the event as a bubble that would float away. I then pictured myself without that bubble. I (mentally) let it go. It goes back to what the Buddha first called the Forefold Truths, or the "4" in early language. First, you watch anger, emotions, (suffering) arise but instead of attaching to them, you understand that they are just something that's separate from you. You then use meditation to let them go and when you fully let go, you then have a chance at nirvana or total freedom. Keeping that practice of seeing, understanding and letting go is then the eightfold path. In essence, being Buddhist is being at peace. 

A person who is fit to talk with, is the opposite of the above. The Buddha concludes the purpose of teaching and discussing, as quoted by Samana Johann in his answer: 

I'm not sure what did you consider as being mutually exclusive concerning emptiness. Philosophically, emptiness is defined differently in the Theravada and Mahayana traditions. You can find out about it in this question. Emptiness in the Theravada tradition is about the five aggregates and in fact all phenomena, being empty or devoid of a self. This is relevant for insight meditation, in the contemplation of mental objects (dhammas) i.e. for the fourth foundation of mindfulness. 

So, how does an ukkaṭṭha āraññika get his food? Only from lay people who dare enter the potentially dangerous forest area to give them food or can they eat food that they can find in the forest like fruits? If they eat fruits etc. in the forest, wouldn't that be a violation of another rule requiring the monk to get his food from alms? Here, I assume that an ukkaṭṭha āraññika does not go to inhabited areas for alms, by the very definition of "ukkaṭṭha āraññika". 

Buddha Nature is said to originate from the concept of the "luminous mind" in Pabhassara Sutta, which is anyway not eternal, not unconditioned and not impermanent (see this answer). Nirguna Brahman is described in Advaita as the substratum of all phenomena in Vivekachudamani 289 and as the material cause of the phenomenal universe in Aparokshanubhuti 45. So, while Buddha Nature is simply the potential for enlightenment (a principle), it is not the material "essence" of ultimate truth, which Nirguna Brahman is. So Buddha Nature and Nirguna Brahman are not the same. The second concept often wrongly equated with Nirguna Brahman, is Madhyamaka's "emptiness of emptiness" or shunyata. This answer in Hinduism.SE explains why both are not the same. Basically, Nirguna Brahman is empty of qualities but not empty of substance. Meanwhile, shunyata is empty of substance and even this emptiness itself is empty of substance or existence. In other words, Nirguna Brahman is a Transcendental Absolute Reality, while shunyata is devoid of any transcendental or absolute reality. This is supported by Banaras Hindu University Professor T. R. V. Murti's statement (quoted below) in this book chapter: Murti T.R.V. (1973) Saṁvṛti and Paramārtha in Mādhyamika and Advaita Vedānta. In: Sprung M.
