It seems obvious that highly collectivist Feudal societies, especially Monastic Orders had cooperation and division of labor. And even though most of the participants held no money, they still took part in some degree of voluntary exchange. So this premise seems easily contradicted by history. In such an arrangement complete alignment of goals (safety in the general Feudal case, and spiritual advancement among monks) is presumed. So these folks are pursuing their own goals, and that might still theoretically be the reason for the values. But that means that collectivism and pursuing one's own goals are not mutually exclusive. So I see this mostly as a false dichotomy. To the degree that collective goals are powerful and natural and cannot be met without common alignment they are still the goals of individuals. We see every day how shared decisions are not what individuals might decide for themselves, create inefficiency by letting individuals resent that gap. Far too many people who could clearly do no better themselves will second-guess their children's state-provided teachers. Virtually no one approves of how highway construction gets done. We all doubt that controlled utilities like electricity or sewage really need to cost so much. People rail against the 47% of folks who pay no taxes, and then go collect their government-pooled retirement payments. The list is endless. To the degree that this means these things are over-regulated by extra layers of bureaucracy in the interest of satisfying gripers, or pointlessly thwarted by those who are actually outright dependent upon them, in a way that reduces their efficiency, there is needless collective waste. And to the degree that harboring these emotions causes people not to contribute in other ways, there is foot-dragging, malingering, minor sabotage and other individual waste. The question then becomes how aligned a culture really is in its values, how collective a decision can be about a goal, and therefore whether it is going to do more harm than good to force people to share a single decision. A Feudal culture becomes insanely wasteful when people genuinely believe that they have ways of being safe other than being extorted by a member of the warrior class. And so they basically do not exist anymore. A Monastic culture falls apart without earnest devotion to a clear dogma, and those are becoming quite rare, too. But if we all agree that everyone should have equal access to water, we can get behind that collectively, make a clear legal solution, and quash bickering about the issue without a massive loss of efficiency (even in Texas, our country's most individualistic state). Declaring that making this collective will necessarily cause more waste than leaving it at risk, is too strong an assumption. 

But when it comes down to society-shaping definitions like that of marriage, the problem is that we approach the same question from incommensurable paradigms. There is no way to argue about the definition in isolation, one must grasp the two worldviews in which the two definitions are embedded and choose one over the other, or derive something in between. Those who want a narrow definition may see marriage as something we actively support as a culture, and would like the resources and attention to go where they strengthen the culture itself. Those who want a very broad one may be concerned about the costs of stigmatization that happen when family structures do not efficiently fit into the overall pattern of the society. The former paradigm is that "we have a culture". The later is that we are a pluralistic multiculture, and "we have no single culture". Arguing out the compromise between those paradigms cannot be done by focussing on their effects on a single word. So this, like many arguments centered on words, is ultimately not about definitions at all, it is about paradigms. It does not matter how you define marriage, it matters how that definition relates to your notions of justice, culture, efficiency, freedom, support, etc. So the right way to set about deciding upon a definition is to realize what it will be embedded in, and to decide what role you expect it to play in a broader philosophical system. 

Our original notion for parenting in the West was driven strongly by a focus on discipline and conformity. The child's 'spirit' was to be broken so that he would submit to guidance, and this accorded well with the notion 'Thy will, not mine, be done, O Lord.' The modern approach then, generally seen as 'child-centered' rearing, starts from a clear reversal of those attitudes, and is (in dialectic style) an abject overreaction, even by the standards of its originators. Three schools in this vein represent much of its philosophical base: John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and the Child Psychiatry movement initially within Freudianism, but later its continuation as part of Developmental Psychology within Clinical Psychology in general. Dewey's concern was to move education away from indoctrination and make it what we would now call a 'feedback loop'. But this was transformed quickly into a focus on taking leadership from the child. Within his lifetime, Dewey had already had to start arguing against his followers on this point, but the less tempered form continued to have a strong effect on teaching. Montessori's concern was to optimize the opportunities for growth in the child, instead of trying to create them. She pointed out how following cues from the child is much more efficient than trying to create focus artificially. Her motivations were very young children or children of low mental age, for whom traditional education was a bad fit. But efficiency is hardly the problem for an ordinary child. There is more than enough time and resources for us to grow up. Coverage of the range of things one should focus on becomes more of an issue. This is especially obvious when you step back from professional education, which consumes the time of highly trained people, to parenting, which involves huge tracts of time one can almost not manage to waste (although that is changing a bit in single-parent or double-income families, time is not really the issue). Developmental Psychology points out some strangely non-intuitive aspects of learning that shocked folks, by looking at children who had serious problems being educated. They discovered complex interactions later simplified and proved by Behaviorists. Reward works better than punishment, so much so that absence of reward constitutes punishment, and overdone punishment can act as a reward. Unwanted behaviors naturally extinguish themselves when replaced by more usable alternatives, but do not respond directly to suppression by punishment if no better alternative serves the same unconscious function. Trauma has far deeper effects than we generally imagine. Interaction with principal figures matters a great deal less in substance, and more in form, than we knew -- it does not happen at the conscious level we might imagine, and it bleeds out into our overall patterns of interaction. (Brene Brown is kind of the modern spokesperson for these ideas. They are important, and she is great.) As expressed abstractly, these things point us in a direction of less and less rigidity and reactivity in addressing children, and pressures parents to be more and more protective and gentle. But in practice, although true, they are somewhat self-contradictory, and they are overemphasized to the degree they were striking at the time. The major impediment to using them abstractly is that some components of resilience are learned as much as any other skill, and untested skills are not well internalized. Nathaniel Branden, the original popularizer of the word 'self-esteem' spent much of his later life resisting the unbalanced notions that people had about the concept and the damage he felt was being done to education and parenting in his name. The deepest problem, here, as I see it, is that like much of modern psychology, it originates in solving the problems of those at both extremes of accomplishment, rather than deriving direction from normal functioning. Other than Dewey himself, these workers generally tried to leverage successes with the disabled, or with those bored and disaffected by the weakness of the curriculum into a general plan that would be deployed mostly upon people far from either of those extremes. At the same time, these are educational philosophies, aimed at educators, not parents, and the separation of teaching from parenting is lost by many practitioners who got their inspiration from wards of the State, or children who otherwise could gain little from their parents. 

I totally disagree with your evaluation of this from a Kantian point of view. The principle value in Kant is autonomy, that is, allowing the individual to express itself as an end, to find its own purpose. Changing the person removes their autonomy, unless they choose the change for themselves for a good reason. (The freedom involved is not primarily about pleasure or willingness, it is much more about purpose.) Would the natives, of their own free will and logic, choose to have the fruits of their labor go to some buyer and not to their own families and cultures, who raised them? This would be irresponsible: abandoning your potential parental and filial obligations, just because it is pleasant to do so, is not universalizable. Some of the people dependent upon you may be children or the elderly who have no other recourse. They would not choose to be deprived of your help. The case is less clear in the utilitarian case. But you are at least omitting a major downside from your computations. Again, what of the culture from which all this labor has been stolen? Why don't they figure in the calculations? Surely taking away a working member from a subsistence economy causes serious deprivation. Far more is lost there than would be gained by adding several times as much slave labor to an already technologically sophisticated culture. 

Each form is equivalent to either of the other two from a different perspective, so there is no combining, they are just all the same. To put it very elliptically: Universal interchangeability of perspectives relative to every moral law implies we must all have autonomy (or no one would). So form 1 implies form 2. Autonomy comes with agency, including responsibility to systematically protect everyones autonomy. So form 2 implies form 3. And protecting everyone's autonomy implies you should not treat people too differently, so moral laws should be univeral. So form 3 implies form 1. 

There is a major distinction between just restricting liberty and insisting upon an absolute inconsistency. Of course every state has the right to "actively restrict[] the freedom/liberty of its citizens (at least temporally) in the name of security and expanded freedom in the future." Otherwise it could hardly be a state. If it cannot restrain murderers, in the interest of making it safe to walk the streets, it is not really a state. The problem with the draft from a Quaker point of view is that Western states supposedly support religious freedom, and are populated mainly by people whose religions forbid killing. By making a Christian or a Jew decide what kind of killing is allowed, contrary to the fact that loving my neighbor as myself probably implies not killing him, and there is an absolute commandment against killing in the Old Testament, you are destroying their ability to really hold one of these religions. If you are an Islamist state you might have a draft -- it offers access to a martyr's death. In a Confucianist state where sacrifice for the general good is a primary value, you might also. But in a state that originates from Christian domination, even if you have a State religion based on Christian doctrine, you are caught on the horns of a dilemma -- who decides what degree of literal Christianity is protected? In a more modern nation that has cut ties with any older religion, even when that religion is one that should allow conscription were it the State religion, we have laws protecting religious pluralism, and that still means letting individuals decide whether or not they can kill. 

Marxism has a bias toward the middle class and the process of business as a pointless burden. This is embodied here in writing off book-keeping as a deduction in labor time. But the notion this is pointless has been disproven in the information economy, and was already largely countered by military history as early as Napoleon. Logistics allows for control and refinement of targeted investment of both materiel and force, both capital and labor. The labor theory of value fails to understand that well-applied labor requires something essentially different from absolute labor. There is a mental aspect of work that cannot be reduced to a reproducible activity simply by defining mental work as work, and declaring all work to be measured by time spent and resources consumed. The middle class is essentially different from the upper and lower classes in that what it produces are not realities, but efficiencies. Failing to capture this, planned ventures such as government economies fail to build into their plans the necessary feedback and motivation for optimization, which in capitalism takes the form of loyalties to a given business identity and its expansion, merger or dissolution. If you want to understand the nature of book-keeping study either logistics under Napoleon, perhaps via modern writing on his methods and his obsessive control of timing; or folks writing about the modern information economy. These folks are no longer considered philosophers, but 'futurists' or economists. An approachable version is Alvin Toffler's "Third Wave". Ray Kurzweil has a cool take on a contrasting phenomenon, where logistics outstrips its purpose. Efficiency through information leverage is focussed on definite notions of work that underly both capitalist and socialist thinking. But it breaks their rules and predictions, even though it can only make sense of its own activities in terms of their goals. This produces a sort of creeping metaphysical conundrum leading up to a worship of information itself and data amassing faster than it can be assimilated or used. His analysis of what this might lead to, can be found in his writing about "The Singularity". 

This is just bigotry. No one should consider such a question until they can actually debunk both Berkely and Hume with something that holds water. Until then, it is religion fervor that holds this approach together, even while competing religions try to tear it down. The fact this is the competition at hand should tell you something. 

Utilitarianism does not require altruism in a situation of complete lack of faith in providence. If anyone's fortunes may immediately reverse at any moment, and they may then become the least privileged members of society, or if they may be elevated spontaneously into a position of rulership, the statistically best position is for them is for the system as a whole to maximize average benefit. (Or at least to draw maximum and minimum benefit close together, which is just the median-vs-mean alternative formulation of the same position.) Of course, none of us think this way. We have a certain level of tribal faith and faith in social stability that leads us to assume our positions in society are secure and will not change very much unless we actively do something that changes them. But this lack of tribalism and faith in providence is not altruism. It does not imply any real concern for others, just defense against extreme fates. "There but for the grace of go I." is not really an altruistic motive, taken literally. It is easiest for us to enter into this position from individual empathy. But that empathy is not any better reason to take it seriously than simple statistics unless you have a counterbalancing faith in overall social stability. You can claim that social stability is an observed trend, and that presuming it is just logic. But that is because our current systems of ethics and government are not utilitarian -- they are skewed to the benefit of the privileged and have built that stability into their value system. 

First of all, there is a category error here, comparing utilitarianism -- an entire class of related forms of ethics, to Kantianism -- a very specific theory, is not possible. If one chose utility functions in such a way that autonomy was a highly valued form of pleasure and utilities topped out at a given level, you could pretty much achieve a form of utilitarianism that consistently gave the same results as Kant. So then how can you decide between these isomorphic but independent theories? But even then, the two have rather different orientations. Kant is not intended to work out the solution to very specific problems. The notion of contingent duties means that it will very seldom actually give you a direct answer to a fully expressed question. At some point, you will introduce a detail that causes some aspect of some duty involved to be contingent, and then in deference to your own autonomy, Kant will not tell you precisely what to do. For general questions like murder or lying about which humans already have strong intuition anyway, Kant gives a reason to trust our existing human instincts by putting them into a general framework in which most folks can see the value. Utilitarianism has very much the opposite focus, it is almost impossible to apply to general questions without details, because you cannot predict the suffering of someone without knowing pretty specifically how they are going to be treated. And even then, you cannot propose a way of combining different kinds of suffering without a strong cultural basis for differentiating values: do we find mental anguish to be pain, or the fear of change? Which one should we weighted more? Different traditions would give rather different answers there. So each is terribly weak at different kinds of questions, and where each is best, that one is generally going to give you back a clarified reflection of what you, yourself, put in. So in practice, the value in these systems is not really in determining morality, but in grounding agreements and opening negotiations. Neither is generally better at this.
