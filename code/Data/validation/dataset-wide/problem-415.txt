Importantly, we can see that your device as described must violate conservation of momentum, even without knowing how it works. To do that, I'll make a slight change to the scenario and set it in space: that way, we don't have to worry about momentum being transferred to and from the Earth. So, to set the scene, we have a truck bearing down on our kinetic knife (feel free to use the name!). Just before the moment of impact, we pull a curtain over the whole scene. After a second, we pull back the curtain. The knife is still floating where it was before, but the truck is now split into two neat pieces, each traveling at right angles to to the original direction of motion. I'm making two assumptions here about how the kinetic knife works in your headspace: 

The nickel/iron battery is probably the one you want to go with; not only does it have high energy density, but such batteries could literally be forged from fallen stars, giving them an additional magical flavor (if you're going for a "traditional fantasy" magic feel with hard-science backing). Note that the amount of power contained in such a battery is enormous: a one-ounce coin of enriched nickel can release enough energy to: 

I agree with Cort Ammon that a "sentience icon" is probably a bad idea, but for a slightly different reason. Imagine that someone demands you wear whatever badge/armband/forehead tattoo they come up with: after all, you could be an android! Or even worse, they decide you don't deserve to display their icon because they don't think you're sentient enough. At best, the sentience icon would become a symbol of discrimination against "less-than-sentient" machines, at at worst it would become a tool of discrimination, for whoever wields the power to bestow the icon to pick and choose who deserves to be treated like a "real person." Another point (made by DaaaahWhoosh) is that some sentient machines may not be able to talk to people... sort of. The planetary orbital traffic controller AIs (for example) can definitely talk to spacecraft operators, but they couldn't exactly hold a conversation: they don't burden themselves with trying to understand cultural implications or other subtle nuances, focusing just on the standard language-independent procedural phrases. 

Note that the 'sensors' used in science fiction TV shows are confused too easily. For example, often times a character will say that the sensors are picking up nothing at all... even when the thing is clearly visible to optical sensors (i.e. the ship's cameras and the characters' eyes). Star Trek is a particularly notable offender here. In real life, if you can see down to the planet, and your sensors include a telescope, you can tell what's going on down there. Basically, in order to block sensors, you need to block the mechanism they use to observe. In 99% of cases your sensors will be detectors (or emitters) of electromagnetic radiation. Remember we can use a wide variety of wavelengths to probe the surface. For example, the moon Titan is totally obscured by its atmosphere in visible wavelengths, but infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths see through somewhat, and radar penetrates handily giving us a good view of the surface. Your planet would need to have a thick atmosphere to block all UV, visible, and IR wavelengths. Something like Venus's sulfuric acid coulds would do nicely. However, Venus can also be mapped by radar. Maybe some sort of conductive substance in the atmosphere, like metal dust, could function as chaff to block microwave, low, and medium-frequency communications, including radar. I know this doesn't sound like a nice place to live to us, but the (non-human) aliens who live there might find it quite pleasant! 

Projectile Atmospheric Entry Simulations I put together a bit of code to compute the trajectory of projectiles as they fall through the Earth's atmosphere. I made the following simplifying assumptions: 

Pretty much all these problems can be countered by floating close to sea level above somewhere with no people or plants. But in that case, they'd probably just drop it down the last 100 feet and float it on the ocean—much easier. 

I'll just consider the case of a secondary battery (it turns out that primary batteries using alpha decay are only energy-dense for heavy, radioactive nuclides, and proton or neutron emission are almost never energetically favorable). Looking at a table of nuclides, we want two stable isotopes on a diagonal from each other (i.e. with the same mass number). Considering only elements that are found alloyed with various metals, this leaves us just a few possibilities: $$ {}^{14}\text{C}\leftrightharpoons{}^{14}\text{N}\\ {}^{26}\text{Mg}\leftrightharpoons{}^{26}\text{Al}\\ {}^{32}\text{Si}\leftrightharpoons{}^{32}\text{S}\\ {}^{50}\text{Ti}\leftrightharpoons{}^{50}\text{V}\leftrightharpoons{}^{50}\text{Cr}\\ {}^{53}\text{Cr}\leftrightharpoons{}^{53}\text{Mn}\\ {}^{54}\text{Cr}\leftrightharpoons{}^{54}\text{Fe}\\ {}^{58}\text{Fe}\leftrightharpoons{}^{58}\text{Ni}\\ {}^{59}\text{Co}\leftrightharpoons{}^{59}\text{Ni}\\ {}^{60}\text{Fe}\leftrightharpoons{}^{60}\text{Ni}\\ {}^{63}\text{Ni}\leftrightharpoons{}^{63}\text{Cu}\\ {}^{64}\text{Ni}\leftrightharpoons{}^{64}\text{Zn}\\ {}^{92}\text{Zr}\leftrightharpoons{}^{92}\text{Mo}\\ {}^{93}\text{Zr}\leftrightharpoons{}^{93}\text{Mo}\\ {}^{94}\text{Zr}\leftrightharpoons{}^{94}\text{Mo}\\ {}^{96}\text{Zr}\leftrightharpoons{}^{96}\text{Mo}\\ $$ Let's go over the more plausible ones: 

The oxygen would burn long before then. Whether it's consumed by regular burning (in a high-oxygen environment, everything becomes highly flammable, even diamonds), rusting the rocks themselves, or by nuclear reactions (turning the oxygen into silicon, then iron, then supernova), no oxygen would ever reach the sun. 

Your mad scientist faces two problems. You would need $2\times 10^{41}~\mathrm{J}$ to blow apart the sun. Anything less than this and gravity simply pulls the sun back together. As mentioned before this is an unimaginable amount of energy. (Although less than a percent of the total energy the sun will emit in its lifetime). This is equivalent to around 40% of the mass-energy of the Earth. Already it seems destroying the Earth is a better bet. The sun is too small to go supernova. The smallest type of supernova is a type Ia, where a white dwarf of around 1.4 solar masses has just enough mass added to it that it collapses further, igniting fusion through the whole star. Stars less massive than this are not dense enough for any thermal runaway process to occur. Essentially you would need to rapidly age the sun billions of years and then increase its mass by 40% to re-ignite fusion. 

I can already note a few problems. ArtOfCode explicitly allowed a part of an object to recreate the whole, even if other parts of that object still exist. This gives us: Infinite Guitars Cheat You need to sell your '58 Les Paul 'cause you're low on money, but you really don't want to. No problem! Take a saw (or an axe, it doesn't have to be pretty) and cut the guitar in half. It doesn't have to be exact, you just need to end up with two pieces. Now, repair each one of those pieces. Each one will turn into a full guitar. Not only do you get to keep one, but the other is now worth even more since it's factory fresh! You could do the same thing to one or both guitars, allowing you to make as many as you want. This applies to "any inanimate object!" Want two cakes for your birthday? Save a slice and "repair" it to give you a new cake! Want more money? Cut a tenner in half, repair both halves, and now you have £20! You don't just have to split objects in two: you can be much more efficient if you shred each object into tiny pieces, because each piece will become a new object. In wartime, the ability to indefinitely copy any object would be incredibly valuable. Constructing objects in this way uses no resources, so there would be no shortages as there were during the World Wars. You could make a gun out of the most cutting-edge, impossibly valuable materials, using the most expensive and time-consuming methods, and then give two to every man in the army! A 10-meter radius is pretty big. Assuming that you can set up some multi-level track system to push traincars of bits through a vertical 20-meter circle at 30 mph (and handle the logistics of such a massive flow of goods), you could generate on the order of 1 million tons of supplies per hour! Again, this applies to "any inanimate object," including weapons and ammunition, vehicles, food, etc. With essentially no limit on production, the Empire would expand unstoppably. Rules Issues There are a few problems with the rules as-is:
