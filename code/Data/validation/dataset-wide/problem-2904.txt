Problems are caused by ego. Ego is what makes greed, jealousy, hatred, self-pity and such possible. Keep that self-pity in mind especially, and notice how often that is the root of the problems. Enlightened people experience an existence without ego. What you think defines you, like your needs, your social status, how wealthy you are and such, are all delusional. Changing your mind to solve a problem is only good if your perception, which you are about to change to, is closer to the truth/reality than your old perception was. What really defines you is how well you operate within the system you live. That is, how much do you care for others, your own body, the environment and such. Do you create structure, or do you cause chaos? Your body exists of structure, not of chaos, for example. From the point of view that the origin of all is internal, and not external, one can logically derive that all problems are rooted internally. You are a consciousness, you interpret information. The root of the problem lies at understanding that the origin of each problem you experience is rooted within yourself. Thats why blaming others will never solve any of the problems you have. 

With regard to the video: I think it goes to much in to practical detail at first. I would like to come at this from a more abstract level. 

You are conscious. Consciousness is ALL there is. Consciousness creates purpose. Become more consciousness and you find (create) more purpose in life. There is no end to that. Just likea fractal has no end and can become more and more complex when energy is put in to the formula to create a fractal. Consciousness wants (needs) to evolve. So the purpose of us all is to learn how to create synergy. As that is how we grow. So in the most abstract concept, your life's purpose is exactly the same as mine. The videos five questions can be derived from the purpose, that ALL there is (which is conscious) wants (needs) to evolve. Now you can go into more detail. How can I serve ALL there is? By creating synergy. Doing what you are good at. Because you can create more synergy with what your good at than by struggling with things you s*ck at in a certain period of time. Now derive his 5 questions from the concept above, and I think that is your answer. To touch a little more upon what the video says: He talks about finding out what other people need and how to make them happy. Altruism is key to serving a larger system. The opposite, ego, is destructive for a larger system. If you create synergy with someone else, you become more, and that person becomes more. So in that case you are also altruistic, because you serve what they need. Only looking at your title: I could have typed: Find a purpose by asking whether you could be of help to someone (in the scheme of creating synergy, not by serving their ego's). Than there is a purpose. :D Just kidding though! 

Your question can't be answered with yes or no. Would it still be you or not. Because it depends on YOUR perspective. No one else can decide your perspective for you. In the holistic sense. Where there is just one, one being, one system, one consciousness(,whatever you name it), there has never been something else but you. So in that case, the brain upload to a computer is already you from the very first moment. Even while it is only uploaded for 50% it is you. Because everything is you. So yes, if you would be able to clone the entire functioning of your brain to another system, it is still you. It has always been you. On the other hand (the perspective you are likely having now) is the dualistic perspective. No it won't be you. Because you identify yourself to be your ego (most likely). And if you upload the functioning of your brain to another system, that other system is not you (your ego). Your ego does not identify itself with that newly created clone. Your ego would still be the one that started the uploading process. If the functioning of your brain is completely cloned, then another ego is created, as it probably has the same perspective before the cloning started. So the answer is yes and no. Yes because all is you, and no because your ego won't identify with the new clone. The in fact, the answer lays within yourself, your perspective. 

You are asking about time, a very difficult thing to grasp. According to Einstein it is relative. Your time is not my time, and vica versa. Time seems to depend on the observer... But lets forget about that, to keep things simple. I think you can compare it to a computer. More and more scientists come to the conclusion that the universe is actually one big computer, E.g. My Big TOE written by Tom Campbell, a former NASA physicist, Programming the Universe by Seth Lloyd who proposed the first feasible quantum computer, and others). A computer only has it current state. The past states, or possible calculable future states do not exist. The future states only exist in potency but haven't been actualized. And the past states don't exist anymore either. With every CPU tick, its state is altered. Nowadays a computer is very capable of rendering some nice graphics, 3D if you will. A car moving on the screen seems to have motion, yet it's movement exists of a sequence of positions projected on the screen on after the other. If you go along with the universe being one gigantic computer, then particles moving is the same. It is granular, not continious. Hence planck length and planck time are the like the pixels on a computer screen. And the speed of light is the max frequency of the CPU of the computer. If the computer isn't observed, its state is undetermined, it is a cloud of chance (like Schrodinger's cat, or decaying atoms). When you probe its state, the wave function collapses to a state, which is always in the now, in the present moment, the moment of observation. Hence that is the only state that exists. But as soon as you would be able to observe again, that state is not actual anymore. Because a new state could be determined. So assuming a computer can only calculate now, it can not calculate in the future nor in the past I would go along with your statement that things change in the now. Maybe that is due to consciousness observes in the now, just like the particle-wave duality double slit experiments. 

Thomas Campbell, a former NASA physicist, who became a consciousness researcher states that time is not fundamental, at least not the time we experience here in this universe. It comes down to this: is the time in a computer game fundamental? No it is not, it can be paused, rewound or reset. The time in the game is the experience of the gamer of the difference between the results of calculations. The game is no continuous fluid process, but it is a iterative process (results of calculations). In this perspective, the hardware and software is more fundamental than the time the gamer experiences. Mr. Campbell states that what we live in is a calculated reality as well, just like that game. Our time is therefore not fundamental, because there are processes going on that do the calculations, just like in the game, that make us experience time. Those processes are more fundamental than the time we experience. If, what we live in, is a virtual calculated reality. Than the big bang was the moment the game was loaded and began to play. Before the initializing of the game (the big bang) modules were loaded, memory was allocated, processing power was put to use, but our time didn't start yet, not until the big bang / the game was initialized. So my answer would be: Yes there is logic without time, it depends on which virtualized layer you are at, and at which calculated layer you are looking upon. If you look at the time of the game, that time is not fundamental to you, you can pause the game e.g. so you are more fundamental than the time of the game. Mr Campbell states there are more fundamental processes than the space/time universe we experience. Your consciousness is more fundamental than the time(and space) it experiences here. This may seem far fetched, it might even be unsettling to think about, as it may make you feel infinitely small, and it may wider your experience-able reality.
