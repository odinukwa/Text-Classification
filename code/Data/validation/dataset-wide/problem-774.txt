Also see the related concept of heliostat - same idea, just applied to sunlight. A moving flat reflects sunlight in a fixed direction. Some solar power plants use heliostats. So, in principle, fixed curved primary + moving flat is doable, and has been implemented a number of times. However, there are substantial issues with this design. First off, the size and the quality of the flat mirror are not less than the size and quality of the parabolic primary. Let's say you build a liquid mirror telescope because it's easy. Then you have to make a flat mirror of the same diameter, with the same precision, and all the ease of construction is now lost. Flat mirrors are not easier to make than parabolic. In fact, as a mirror maker, I prefer to work on curved catopters - in some ways they are more predictable during manufacturing than large, high precision flats. There are further issues down the road for the liquid mirror telescope. You would actually need 2 flats, both very large, both very precise. Both would have to be suspended in the air, above the liquid primary, and supported by complex mirror cells just like curved primaries in any telescope. Overall, it will be more difficult to make such a telescope, not less. So why is the Pfund design used? Not for ease of manufacturing; as I said above, it's actually more difficult to make it than a regular scope. But in some situations you just need that fixed focal plane for some reason. In that case, you don't have much of a choice. Of course, it's not a design that scales well. 

The galilean moons are visible in binoculars, indeed. Yesterday evening (assuming you're in the western hemisphere), 3 of them were visible as separate dots. See the chart here: $URL$ You can adjust the query to reflect your time zone, and the actual date/time of the observation. There are also smartphone apps that allow you to determine the position of the moons at any given time. On Android I use the Moons of Jupiter app. 

At any given instant of time, in any place on Earth, if the sky is clear and the horizon is low and flat, you see half of the celestial sphere - at that very instant. But as the Earth keeps turning, you may end up seeing more, depending on where you are. If you're at the North or South Pole, you see exactly half of the sky no matter how long you wait. That's all you'll ever see from there. If you move closer to the Equator, you'll end up seeing more than half, if you're willing to wait. At the Equator, you see pretty much all the sky, if you wait as the Earth keeps spinning around, revealing all the sky to you eventually. 

First off, a few words about the objects you'll observe. There are two kinds of objects: HIGH RESOLUTION, HIGH BRIGHTNESS These are the planets, the Moon, many double stars, and the like. These are typically pretty bright, so the amount of light you capture is not essential. But these objects show high-resolution detail, so the resolving power of your scope is crucial. You get more resolving power if the aperture (the diameter) of the scope is bigger. But there's a problem - seeing (the inverse of turbulence). $URL$ When air is turbulent, it will reduce the resolving power of your instrument. If your scope is 200 mm (8") or bigger, this will happen A LOT. If your instrument is 100 mm (4") or smaller, it's not so noticeable because you don't have that much resolving power to begin with. There are ways to forecast seeing, because it depends on weather: $URL$ So, for high resolution targets, the point of having a large instrument (like a huge dobsonian) is because once in a while seeing is so good (turbulence is so low) that you can actually use all its huge power - but most of the time you'll be using it at much less than its theoretical power, as if it's a 4" instrument or whatever the seeing is at the moment. These objects are not affected by light pollution. You could observe the Moon from a brightly illumined parking lot in the middle of the city. You don't need to be in deep darkness while observing them - in fact, it's beneficial if you're not adapted to very deep darkness. LOW BRIGHTNESS These are most of the nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies. These are distant, faint objects. Their light is very faint, so it's essential you capture as much of it as possible. Again, bigger aperture is better. These are the kind of objects that huge dobsonians (half-meter aperture, or more) are made for. In a very large scope, there's galaxies everywhere. But again, there's a catch. These objects are affected by light pollution. $URL$ You need to take your scope far and away from any city, town and industrial complex (at least a 1 hour trip at highway speed). This is pretty hard to do in Europe; in the US, population density is low and this is somewhat easier. Anyway, just stay away from city lights and the view will improve. A few of these objects will be visible from the city: the Andromeda galaxy, the M13 cluster, the Orion nebula, etc. But many of them look much, much better away from light polution. In any case, you should be able to observe the whole Messier catalogue (over 100 objects) from the city - but out in the boondocks these things look better. $URL$ It's important that your eyes are adapted to very deep darkness when observing these things, so stay away from any source of light. Even the screen of your phone is far too bright. Street lights 500 meters away are too bright. And turn off that flashlight and keep it off. One second of exposure to a bright light destroys a dark adaptation that took 20 minutes to build. Since these objects are so faint, the eye doesn't see a whole lot of high-resolution detail, so they are not affected by seeing (as far as the human eye is concerned). 

As a general rule, there isn't much point in pushing the magnification above 2x the diameter of the instrument, measured in mm. 3 inch, that's 75mm, that's 150x max. Beyond that limit, even under ideal skies the image is large but blurry. After that, seeing (or air turbulence) pushes that limit further down. Your aperture is small enough that it almost never suffers from seeing, but larger instruments are often affected. It varies greatly with time, place and season. There are times when a 12" dobsonian, that in theory could do 600x, is clamped down by seeing to 150 ... 180x. There are times when you could take a 20" dobsonian all the way up to 1000x - but that's very, VERY rare, it's the stuff of legends. Assuming average seeing conditions and instruments of usual size (refractors of 3...4" aperture, reflectors 6" or larger), here are some rules of thumb: Jupiter is seen best under mid-high magnification. It's rare that more than 200x is beneficial. This is because it's a very low contrast object, and additional magnification comes at the cost of less contrast, which makes things worse. Saturn works best at high-ish magnification, bit more than Jupiter but maybe not much more. Around 200 ... 250x usually works. It depends on what you do - if you're trying to see the ring divisions, push it a bit higher. Mars can use the highest magnification that you could generate, given the instrument and the conditions. It's a very small object, contrast is not bad, so crank it all the way up. Most instruments are limited by seeing when observing Mars. Moon is the same as Mars. As you can see, magnification is never an issue for you. More magnification will not make it better. In fact, more magnification always means the image is more blurry, not more crisp - it's always a compromise between size and blurriness that decides the optimal magnification. Don't worry, everyone begins thinking that more is always better. Soon enough, experience shows them what's really going on.
