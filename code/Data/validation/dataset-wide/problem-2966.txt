There are arguments based in the explanatory gap of our incomplete understanding of how consciousness might depend upon a nonconscious substrate, especially a physical substrate. And there are arguments based in the structure of scientific explanations and understanding. The basic gap claim admits of many variations in generality and thus in strength. In perhaps its weakest form, it asserts a practical limit on our present explanatory abilities; given our current theories and models we can not now articulate an intelligible link. A stronger version makes an in principle claim about our human capacities and thus asserts that given our human cognitive limits we will never be able to bridge the gap. An even stronger version of the gap claim removes the restriction to our cognitive nature and denies in principle that the gap can be closed by any cognitive agents. Some neodualists have tried to use the existence of the gap to refute physicalism. Dualist conclusions are often supported by appeals to the supposed impossibility in principle of closing the gap. If one could see on a priori grounds that there is no way in which consciousness could be intelligibly explained as arising from the physical, it would not be a big step to concluding that it in fact does not do so: Given the inherently spatial nature of both our human perceptual concepts and the scientific concepts we derive from them, we humans are not conceptually suited for understanding the nature of the psychophysical link. Facts about that link are as cognitively closed to us as are facts about multiplication or square roots to armadillos. They do not fall within our conceptual and cognitive repertoire. To creatures cognitively like us, it must remain a residual mystery. An even stronger version of the gap claim removes the restriction to our cognitive nature and denies in principle that the gap can be closed by any cognitive agents. But it is difficult to assume, without begging, this metaphysical result, without assume a metaphysical principle too. Those who wish to use a strong in principle gap, to claim refute physicalism must find independent grounds to support it, without assuming metaphysical principles at start. Such arguments without metaphysical principles will avoid begging the anti-physicalist question, but they themselves rely upon claims and intuitions that are controversial and not completely independent of one's basic view about physicalism. Therefore, for example, some have appealed to conceivability arguments for support, such as the alleged conceivability of zombies molecularly identical with conscious humans but devoid of all phenomenal consciousness. Other supporting arguments invoke the supposed non-functional nature of consciousness and thus its alleged resistance to the standard scientific method of explaining complex properties in terms of physically realized functional conditions. Such arguments avoid begging the anti-physicalist question, but they themselves rely upon claims and intuitions that are controversial and not completely independent of one's basic view about physicalism. Maybe science is able, in principle, to close the gap and solve the hard problem of consciousness in an analogous way that we now have a very good understanding for why “water is H2O” or “heat is mean molecular kinetic energy” that was lacking centuries ago. Maybe the hard problem isn’t so hard after all – it will just take some more time. After all, the science of chemistry didn’t develop overnight and we are relatively early in the history of neurophysiology and our understanding of phenomenal consciousness. Our present inability to see any way of closing the gap may simply reflect the limits of our current theorizing rather than an unbridgeable in principle barrier. The hard problem of consciousness is why or how does some particular brain process produce that particular taste or visual sensation? It is difficult to see any real explanatory connection between specific conscious states and brain states in a way that explains just how or why the former are identical with the latter. There is therefore an explanatory gap between the physical and mental. This difficulty in explaining consciousness is unique; that is, we do not have similar worries about other scientific identities, such as that “water is H2O” or that “heat is mean molecular kinetic energy.” There is an important sense in which we can’t really understand how physicalism could be true. The existence of a "hard problem" is controversial and has been disputed by some philosophers. For philosophers who assert that consciousness is nonphysical in nature, there remains a question about what outside of physical theory is required to explain consciousness. Consciousness is especially resistant to explanation in physical terms because of the inherent differences between our subjective and objective modes of understanding. There are, for example, unavoidable limits placed on our ability to understand the phenomenology of bat experience by our inability to empathetically take on an experiential perspective like that which characterizes the bat's echo-locatory auditory experience of its world. Given our inability to undergo similar experience, we can have at best partial understanding of the nature of such experience. No amount of knowledge gleaned from the external objective third-person perspective of the natural sciences will supposedly suffice to allow us to understand what the bat can understand of its own experience from its internal first-person subjective point of view. Maybe the bat is not good example why they probably will not pass through the mirror test, a test of self-awareness, but dolphins and elephants pass. The dolphin has sonar and the elephant can hear infrasounds, and we cannot understand what they can understand of its own experience from its internal first-person subjective point of view. But why we must be deluded by schizophrenic and LSD hallucinations to empathetically take on an experiential perspective understanding? Is subjective understanding necessary to make objective science? Some physicists, argue that an interpretation is nothing more than a formal equivalence between sets of rules for operating on experimental data, thereby implying that the whole exercise of interpretation is unnecessary, for example in quantum physics. Any modern physic's scientific theory requires at the very least an instrumentalist description that relates the mathematical formalism to experimental practice and prediction. By abuse of language, a bare instrumentalist description could be referred to as an interpretation, although this usage is somewhat misleading since instrumentalism explicitly avoids any explanatory role; that is, it does not attempt to answer the question why. Most of the laws of physics themselves as we experience them today appear to have emerged during the course of time making emergence the most fundamental principle in the universe and raising the question of what might be the most fundamental law of physics from which all others emerged. Chemistry can in turn be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of physics. Biology (including biological evolution) can be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of chemistry. Finally, psychology could at least theoretically be understood as an emergent property of neurobiological laws. But Science must, as a practical matter, work with high-level principles in dealing with complex systems, and that these principles are confirmed independently of the emergence of, or evidence for, our best fundamental theories. For example there is a rapid rate at which quantum descriptions become more complicated as the size of a system increases. There are a practical impossibility of directly deriving predictions from quantum mechanics for systems containing more than ten particles. Sciences can be arranged roughly in a linear hierarchy — particle physics, many body physics, chemistry, molecular biology, cellular biology, physiology, psychology, social sciences — in that the elementary entities of one science obeys the laws of the science that precedes it in the hierarchy; yet this does not imply that one science is just an applied version of the science that precedes it and reduces it. At each stage, entirely new laws, concepts and generalizations are necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a degree as in the previous one. Psychology is not applied biology nor is biology applied chemistry. There is a limitation in the reductionist/emergentist view of consciousness as emergence of, or reduced to, neurons and chemistry. 

Maybe we want meaning, but Nature doesn't give us meaning - it is arbitrary, uncontrollable... That would be very unsettling and anxiety provoking, and would compel us to create a meaning for ourselves in this world that doesn't offer any. So, through the experience of being in a meaningless world, we experience the need for meaning. 

How should we understand what is going on here from an epistemological point of view? It feels a bit convenient to toss these 2 terms from the point of view of mathematics - well maybe even wrong, in the sense that the resulting Hamiltonian is no longer the result of a sound mathematical derivation? Would it be desirable for the physicist to work with maths that would not yield unphysical solutions? Isn't maths in fact unreasonably ineffective in physics? 

So my question is why does Kant further say that Der arithmetische Satz ist also jederzeit synthetisch (Arithmetical propositions are therefore always synthetical): what is ganz außer in 5 + 7 = 12, if we see 12 as just a convenient short name for 5 + 7? 

If mathematics is concerned with deductive reasoning, and relies on logic to ensure the soundness of its derivations, if on the other hand, the derivations of mathematics, at least in a philosophical and modern view of the subject, start from arbitrary axioms, can mathematics be reduced to arbitrary axioms and logic? Note: arbitrary here means that mathematicians are a priori free to choose an initial set of axioms, as in e.g. Euclidean vs non-Euclidean geometries, that they are not constrained by observations of the natural world in the choice of axioms to derive theorems from. 

There is the distinction between lethal cannibalism, which involves killing and nonlethal cannibalism, which does not involve killing . How might nonlethal cannibalism occur? One kind of case involves people who are stuck in places without food and are forced to consume the flesh of other people, with or without permission. It might be suggested that unless the lives of other people are at stake, respect for dead people requires that their bodies not be ingested by others. It also might be argued that religious prescriptions concerning the treatment of dead persons’ bodies make nonlethal cannibalism morally impermissible. It might be unwise to permit nonlethal cannibalism because such a policy might encourage lethal cannibalism. But nonlethal cannibalism was the norm in many old societies. Anthropological descriptions of allegedly irresolvable cross-cultural ethical conflicts are plentiful: there was socially sanctioned nonlethal cannibalism. One must be careful not to infer that nonlethal cannibalism is morally wrong merely because one finds it disgusting or repulsive. Everyone is familiar with disgusting taste, in many cases we see or think about some particular ethical issue and we have exactly the same disgust response. Typical examples are when people think about cannibalism, about abortion, incest. Is there some biological explanation of why we should have such feelings? Many of us are familiar with having disgust reactions. If you ever had food-poisoning, if you had food-poisoning from some eggs once you couldn't eat them for many years. Other example, the revulsion to incest has a very good biological reason; you’re much more likely to have a genetically abnormal child with a relative. So, many of the taboos can have a strong biological basis. Our disgust reaction can represent the expression of that knowledge. Disgusting reaction, sometimes is genetic; sometimes as with eggs you have a bad experience and thereafter that’s a learnt reaction. It can also be learnt at a social level and it can be passed on through generations. But many the taboos either express a personal disgust or misfire in the sense that they are applied to a situation that is no longer disadvantageous to us. The reaction to eggs can persisted long after. Another example, with incest, we now have very good genetic tests that would pick up genetic abnormality. So, we can now in modern society counter that. The challenge of modern ethics today is not simply to sit with our intuitions, because our intuitions are not necessarily reliable. We need to examine our reasons for actions are in a particular case. Take an example, science is actually proposing, of creating embryos as a source of stem cells, and where those embryos would be destroyed after fourteen days, we can’t simply look at our disgusting reactions. They are very crude rules of thumb that have served us in our primitive past. Actually our reason-giving frequently is a kind of rationalization after the fact; most people end up rationalizing their deepest prejudices and disgusting reactions. Many people do use ethical arguments simply to rationalize their intuitive responses. A psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, used a scenario around incest and cannibalism where he kept probing participants in the experiment for their reason for their objections. The experimenter presented harmless taboo's violations task: consensual adult sibling incest and harmless cannibalism of an unclaimed corpse in a pathology lab. Then played devil’s advocate, arguing against anything the subject said. The key question was whether subjects would behave like idealized scientists, looking for the truth and using reasoning to reach their judgments, or whether they would behave like lawyers, committed from the start to one side and then searching only for evidence to support that side. Subject's responses were very quick judgments followed by a search for supporting reasons. When these reasons were stripped away by the experimenter,few subjects changed their minds, even though many confessed that they could not explain the reasons for their decisions. Whatever reasons they offered, whether it was genetic disability or harm to other members of the family, or paedophilia, or any parasites and prions in the corpses, he countered these reasons by saying the situation won’t be like that, and he went on to give an explanation why not. However, the subjects stuck to their intuitive objection to it, regardless of how invalid their supposed reason was. In the end, they couldn’t offer any other reasons, except that they intuitively had a disgusting reaction to it. Conclusion: One of the ethics challenges is to find reasons that aren’t just intuitive, is to find values that aren’t just grounded on individual feelings, but are grounded on value that’s defensible. We must resolve moral issues through rational discourse, rather than descending to a kind of democratic approach to ethics where we take a vote as to how people respond, how much disgusting there is out there in a population towards that particular practice. Many people have a disgusting response to changing human nature. But we care much more about other aspects of our lives than simply whether we can reproduce. Our fundamental cognitive, physical abilities, could be influenced by changes in human biology. The patterns of human relationships, lust, attraction, have different hormonal mechanisms, each of which can be manipulated. We could make genetic changes in humans, the man can live longer and reproduce much longer, and to be much healthier. Can we simply settle these questions by looking at our intuitions and our disgusting reactions? The good reasons against them won’t be generated by simplistic appeals to our intuitions or disgusting reactions. Is there a danger that if we rid ourselves of the disgusting reaction that we’ll be vulnerable to certain sorts of systematic biases? Is this precisely what the Nazis did, they overcame their disgusting reactions to killing human beings? The Nazis couldn’t appeal to any sort of fundamental values that we all share, and the fact that they were able to overcome their emotional reactions was the fundamental problem. What we need are sound ethical principles. The people who kept slaves, who stopped women voting, believed that they were doing the right thing, had disgusting reactions to blacks marrying whites, and very profound, very deep, very widespread emotions; they were certain that their intuitions were correct. There was a German cannibalism case, where one person wanted to be eaten and the other one wanted to eat him. Some of us feel fairly disgust by that idea, even if other of us can’t find strong reasons against it. 

If reducing mathematics to logic is the goal of logicism, what other conceptions of mathematics are there? 

Here is a basic working definition of a law of physics from the point of view of a physicist. It does lead to several interesting philosophical questions, which I completely ignore (but am very well aware of). A law of physics is a provisional statement of an observed regularity in Nature. We formulate laws of physics to understand the world around us, and also to control it or act in it (not always: a good deal of astronomy for example deals with things that we will never control). A law of physics summarizes many instances of a given phenomenon in a convenient manner. For example, the law of gravitation summarizes in one formula how objects fall towards the ground as well as how planets go around the Sun. An observed regularity is something that holds in many, most or all observed instances of a phenomenon. A law is always provisional in the sense that a more encompassing or more precise statement of a regularity may have to be made later, given more observations. The laws of physics are usually numerical, holding between observable quantities that can be measured, so that the laws take a precise, mathematical form. However, there can be individual instances of measurements that do not exactly conform to the mathematical law at hand: there can be errors due to the measurement equipment or procedure, or fundamental uncertainty as in the case of quantum mechanics. This gives a statistical character to the laws of physics, and it is usually required to estimate the uncertainty in the measurements. A very basic example, but one that is IMHO worthwhile keeping in mind as a good image of a law of physics, would be the following picture, where we have observed a number of data points, and plotted the line (model/law) that bests fits these observations. It shows what the law/model is: the line, i.e. 2 coefficients a and b in a formula y = ax + b. This line summarizes the data points, it is the regularity/invariant underlying the phenomenon. It also allows interpolation and prediction to calculate unmeasured values of y for values of x. Finally, it shows the notion of error in measurement, as many actual points lie close to the line, but not exactly on it. 

Abstract: Zarathustra addresses a ‘little old woman’. Everything about women, he tells her, has pregnancy as a solution. A man should be brought up for war and the woman for the recreation of the warrior. The woman’s task is to bring out the child in the man. The happiness of a man is ‘I will’, of a woman ‘he wills’. Her world becomes ‘perfect’ when she obeys out of total love. The old woman replies with‘a little truth’: ‘You are going to women? Then don’t forget the whip’. It seems to be quite irrelevant that it is put in the mouth of the old woman – this is merely a rhetorical device designed to intensify the force of Zarathustra–Nietzsche’s views on women: ‘You see, even old, that is, wise, women agree with me’, he implies. Nietzsche's biography might be brought to bear on his views on women. He was raised in a family of women of rigidly moralistic views. His marriage proposals were all rebuffed; and the women whom he seemed most to admire, Lou Salomé and Cosima Wagner, were strong-willed individuals who did not especially subscribe to conventional roles for women. No doubt, Nietzsche had many motivations for complicated reactions to "woman as such.” Though the formal point of this passage is to advise the potential free spirit on how to comport himself with women, its main value is as a manifestation of how deeply the Lou Salomé affair had damaged Nietzsche’s attitude to women. There is a very marked contrast between Nietzsche’s empathetic stance towards the plight of women in nineteenth-century Europe in the pre-Lou period and this raising of male chauvinism to the point, even by nineteenth-century standards, of caricature, this insulting slapping down of everything Lou aspired to. It is not hard to see what has happened. In the aftermath of the affair, Nietzsche eased his pain by taking a kind of fictional revenge. The passage, in other words, is cut from the same cloth as the pathologically disturbed letters he wrote to Rée and Lou Salomé at precisely the same time as he was writing Part I of Zarathustra. It is, as he himself says of those letters, incompatible with the rejection of ‘resentment’ by his innermost mode of thinking. Nietzsche might also be seen as sexist's divided attitude because he personifies Life and Wisdom as women in Zarathustra posing Zarathustra as the lover of both. To be set against Zarathustra awful remarks about women in Part I, however, is the fact that in its two ‘dance-songs,’ one in Part II and the other in Part III, ‘Life’ (whom Zarathustra claims to love unreservedly) is portrayed as a woman, ‘wild and not virtuous’( Zarathustra II §10) who dances in an ecstatic circle with ‘flaming, flying hair’( Zarathustra III §15, in part, surely, a portrait of the heroine of Nietzsche’s favourite opera, Carmen). One can analyse this divided attitude to women in terms of Nietzsche’s own categories of the ‘Dionysian’ and the ‘Apollonian’. Women attract Nietzsche because the erotic represents transcendence of suffering individuality, à la Tristan und Isolde, the ‘intoxicated’ absorption into a ‘higher community’, Dionysian, as described in The Birth of Tragedy. Burnt by the Lou affair, however, he reacts with the exaggerated Apollonianism represented by The Birth of Tragedy as the Doric response to the harmful side of Dionysianism: Apollo’s ‘majestic rejection of all licence’ (Birth of Tragedy §2) So dangerous are women that they must be pressed back into the cage of nineteenth-century Apollonian's chauvinism. By Part III of Zarathustra, written towards the end of 1883 as he was beginning to recover a certain, at least temporary, equilibrium after the Lou affair, Nietzsche’s text has calmed down somewhat, and even performs a kind of penance for the whip remark. In The Other Dance-Song ( Zarathustra III §15) Zarathustra tries to make Life dance to his tempo by cracking his whip – as seemingly advised to do in Part I. Life asks him to stop. Surely he knows that ‘noise murders thoughts’, in particular the ‘tender’ thoughts she is beginning to have about him. Even in Part III, however, Nietzsche remains opposed to female emancipation: ‘women are becoming mannish,’ he claims, because there is so little ‘manfulness’ in men – only a properly mannish man will ‘redeem the woman in women’(Zarathustra III §5). Nietzsche's sexism's divided attitude is a complex topic. In some of his writings he mouths the inflammatory misogynistic imagery of Schopenhauer's "On Women," arguably the most notorious denunciation of women in German. For Nietzsche's repetition of Schopenhauerian images (see, for example, Beyond Good and Evil, §232-39). At other times, he presents psychological brief descriptions depicting interactions among women and men; frequently in these, he seems to be sympathetic to women.(This is particularly evident in, for example, Gay Science, §71, which concludes, "In sum, one cannot be too kind about women."). He frequently personifies abstract ideas in female form, and he appeals to stereotypical images of women, although in the latter cases he often plays with the images or refers explicitly to male perceptions of women. Presumably, his preface remark in Beyond Good and Evil, "Supposing truth is a woman - what then?" has been interpreted as sexist because it utilizes stereotypical images of women. An example of Nietzsche's explicit discussion of male fantasy occurs in Gay Science, §59. 

Sometimes in physics, the mathematics leads to "un-physical solutions or terms", that are readily tossed by the physicist. For example, when deriving absorption and emission rates for via quantized light-atom interactions in quantum optics class, we toss out 2 terms from the Hamiltonian, on the grounds that they don't correspond to any observed physical process: 

I'm not sure why 5 + 7 = 12 should say anything new: I take it to be a shorthand notation to give a name to 5 + 7, which anyway is nothing but 5 times the unit + 7 times the unit, so there is not really anything "new" here. Or is there? If we see it the other way around, as 12 = 5 + 7, maybe 5 + 7 is not contained in 12: we have a set of 12 objects, and we say that we can see it as a subset of 5 objects + a subset of 7 objects, so we say that that subdivision of the original set of cardinality 12 exists. But is that really "new"? Of course, 5 + 7 = 12 is cited as an example at the beginning of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, when he explains his view of analytic and synthetic knowledge. The question here though is not meant to criticize analytic judgments, but rather to criticize synthetic a priori judgments. I believe (for the sake of argument) that mathematics is composed entirely of analytic judgments, not synthetic ones, and I am trying to understand why Kant could argue at all that mathematics was in the synthetic camp. More precisely. To define analytic and synthetic judgments, Kant writes at the beginning of the Critique of Pure reason, 2nd ed (emphasis mine):
