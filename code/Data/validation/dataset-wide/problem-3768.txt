This question is more about a curious identity I have come across, than to do with explicit research. The question is somewhat advanced so I'm posting it here rather than on math stackexchange. It comes across as a sort of juvenile identity, but the work put in to show the result is rather tenuous. For starters I'll give the motivation for the question. Consider the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ and holomorphic functions $\phi$ taking $\mathbb{D}$ to itself and fixing $0$, where additionally $\lim_{n\to\infty} \phi^{\circ n}(\xi) = 0$ for all $\xi \in \mathbb{D}$. It is well known, that if $\phi(z) \neq \lambda z$ where $|\lambda| = 1$, the limit $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\phi^{\circ n}(\xi)}{\phi'(0)^n} = \Psi(\xi)$$ constructs a holomorphic function for $\xi$ in $\mathbb{D}$. This function produces the solution to the linearizing of $\phi$, so that $$\Psi(\phi(\xi)) = \phi'(0)\Psi(\xi)$$ Now I've seen this idea phrased slightly differently--in two different manners to be exact. Which leads me to the following. Letting $S$ be the set of all possible such $\phi$, and define the linear operator $C_\phi : S \to S$ such that $$C_\phi f = f \circ \phi$$, and now the construction of the Schroder function can be phrased slightly different. We will skip a small step (proving this is valid is a little space heavy), but the following defines an operator on $S$, for $f \in S$: $$\Psi f = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{C_\phi^n f}{\phi'(0)^n}$$ Now let us go ahead denote $\Psi$ as $\Psi_{C_\phi}$, so that now it is an operator which takes an operator as one of its arguments and a function in $S$ as its other argument. (No it is not linear in the operator argument, just a non-linear operator.) So that $\Psi_{C_\phi}$ is the solution to the operator equation $$\Psi_{C_\phi} C_\phi f = \phi'(0) \Psi_{C_\phi} f$$ Now the second valuable point is the following $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{C_\phi^{n+1} f}{C_\phi^n f} = \phi'(0)$$ Which leads me to the question that is sort of a reference request. Firstly, if $E : S \to S$, and $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{E^{n+1}f}{E^n f} = \lambda$$ where convergence is geometric, so that for some $0 <r <1$ $$|\frac{E^{n+1}f}{E^nf} - \lambda| < Cr^n$$ then instantly $$\Psi_E f = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{E^n f}{\lambda^n}$$ defines a valid operator, because the following product converges absolutely. $$E^0 f \prod_{i=0}^n\frac{E^{i+1}f}{E^{i} f \cdot \lambda} = \frac{E^1f}{E^0 f \cdot \lambda} \cdot \frac{E^2f}{E^1 f \cdot \lambda} \cdot \frac{E^{3}f}{E^2 f \cdot \lambda} ... = \frac{E^{n+1} f}{\lambda^{n+1}}$$ Wherein this new operator $\Psi_E$ satisfies the linearization $$\Psi_E E f = \lambda \Psi_E f$$. Now my question is easier to ask, now that all of this has been cleared up. The notion I was trying to define by the above is "linearizing an operator". Very much like linearizing a function from complex dynamics, but now we are linearizing an operator. Does this exist in mathematics already? Does anyone have a reference to something similar or a landmark where things like this have been studied? Secondly, are there simpler ways of going about and showing results like this? I am noting fervently that for arbitrary $E$ proving that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{E^{n+1}f}{E^n f}$ converges geometrically is really quite difficult. The goal at hand is to linearize an arbitrary operator similarly to how the Schroder function linearizes the operator $C_\phi$, but this one step blocks the path. Can we relax the condition $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{E^{n+1}f}{E^n f}$ converges geometrically somehow? I hope this question isn't too broad and too abstract, this is just something that's been bugging me for awhile and I haven't gotten much feedback from peers about this. 

This question begins with motivation, and then extends to the question itself. The question is rather straight forward, it admits a few well thought out details, specifications which make the question meaningful. The general case of the question is obviously wrong, but in the singular case it appears to follow. Consider a sequence of holomorphic functions $\{f_n(\xi)\}_{n=0}$ where $f_n:D \to \mathbb{C}$ for some domain $D$. Let $f_n(\xi) \to f(\xi)$ uniformly on compact subsets of $D$ so that $f$ is holomorphic. Suppose we take the exponential generating function $\vartheta(w,\xi) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_{n}(\xi)\frac{(-w)^n}{n!}$ which is entire in $w$ and holomorphic for $\xi \in D$. If in the half plane $|\arg(w)| < \pi/2$ we have the decay conditions $\vartheta(w,\xi)w \to 0$ as $w \to \infty$, we have the remarkable fact that for $-1 < \Re(s) < 0$ $$f(s,\xi) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(-s)}\int_0^\infty \vartheta(w,\xi)w^{-s-1}\,dw$$ and $$f(s+n,\xi) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(-s)}\int_0^\infty \vartheta^{(n)}(w,\xi)w^{-s-1}\, dw$$ where the function $f(s,\xi)$ can be analytically continued on the lines $\Re(s) = n \in \mathbb{N}$ and it is holomorphic for all $\Re(s) > -1$. Additionally $f_n(\xi) = f(n,\xi)$. This is an interpolation of $f_n$ but is especially important because we have a uniqueness condition: if $s = \sigma + it$ then $|f(s,\xi)| < C_\kappa e^{\kappa|t|}$ where $\kappa > 0$ is arbitrary and $C_\kappa$ depends on $\kappa$. In fact if there was another function $g(s):\mathbb{C}_{\Re(s) > 0} \to \mathbb{C}$ to satisfy these bounds and satisfy $g(n) = f_n(\xi)$ then $g(s) = f(s,\xi)$. This is a very valuable interpolation, sometimes referred to as Ramanujan interpolation (but this is a much stricter definition). What is obvious, which follows using little work, is that $f(s,\xi)$ is also holomorphic in $\xi$. This is a very simple thing to show. My question can then be stated, does this also work on the real line? Restricting $f_n$ to the real line, so that $f_n(x) : (a,b) \to \mathbb{C}$ is analytic (can be expanded in a Taylor series of positive radius about each $x \in (a,b)$) and converges uniformly to $f(x)$, and furthermore $f^{(k)}_n(x) \to f(x)$ uniformly for all $k$, and $f(x)$ is not just $C^{\infty}$ but analytic. The next fact is first that taking $\vartheta(w,x)$, it is analytic in $x$ (which is a simple proof). The better fact we get is that $\vartheta(w,x)$ can be extended to $\vartheta(w,\xi) : \mathbb{C} \times \mathcal{I} \to \mathbb{C}$ where $I \subset \mathcal{I}$. Just as well we assume $\vartheta(w,x)w \to 0$ as $w \to \infty$ when $|\arg(w)| < \pi/2$. Then the function $f(s,x)$ exists and is holomorphic for all $\Re(s) > 0$ and at best that I can prove, continuous in $x$. Is it possible to show it is also analytic in $x$? I assume this would require that $f(s,\xi)$ is holomorphic for $\xi \in \mathcal{I}$, but to do that, I require showing that $\vartheta(w,\xi)w \to 0$, instead of the condition $\vartheta(w,x)w\to 0$. The only way I could think of approaching this question is using the maximum modulus principle--and I know my reasoning is flawed. Assume $\Omega$ is an arbitrary compact set and $J$ is a compact interval of $(a,b) = I$, such that $J \subset \Omega \subset \mathcal{I}$. Taking $h(w) = \inf_{\xi \in \Omega} |\vartheta(w,\xi)w|$, it follows $h(w) \le |\vartheta(x,w)||w| \to 0$ as $w \to \infty$ because $x$ is in the interior of $\Omega$ and the infimum $h(w)$ is necessarily on the boundary of $\Omega$ and moving across it. Somehow I'm wondering if this forces the decay conditions. I can't seem to actually show it but through empiricism this seems to at least show there is a neighborhood $\mathcal{U}$ in $\xi$ about each $x \in J$ such that $\vartheta(w,\xi)w\to 0$ as $w \to \infty$ when $\arg(w) < \tau_J< \pi/2$ (at least in the cases I'm considering). Regardless of if I'm barking up the wrong tree using the maximum modulus principle, I'd still like to know if anyone has any suggestions. I am truly foiled, but there seems to be something going on I'm missing. As an example of the functions I'm working on, consider for $1 < x < e^{1/e}$ the functions $$f_n(x) = x^{x^{...n\,times...^x}}$$ then $\vartheta(w,x)$ satisfies the decay conditions and $f(s,x)$ is holomorphic in $s$ and is well known for being analytic in $x$ (it equals a pre-existing function which is as such). 

I feel like I have all the pieces to put this together, but I'm probably missing something. The first problem depends on $f^{\circ z}(\xi(x,y)) = u(z,x,y) + i v(z,x,y)$. Namely how can we show that $u(z,x,y_0)$ converges uniformly in $x$ as $z \to 0$ when $y_0$ is fixed? And how can we show $u(z,x_0,y)$ converges uniformly in $y$ as $z \to 0$? How do we do the same thing with $v$? Since I usually deal with holomorphic functions as a whole and not their individual real parts, this has got me a little stooped. Hopefully, I'm not missing something obvious here! 

It follows that such a function exists if we shrink $G$, to say $U$ a tiny neighborhood of $z_0$. We can easily take $\chi(z) = \Phi(\Psi^{-1}(z))$ where $\chi: \Psi(U) \to \Phi(U)$. But in general, what is the maximal domain this works? When does it begin to fail as we let $U$ get bigger? Why? Does it happen for the obvious reason that $\Psi^{-1}$ is no longer defined as we grow $U$? This is to mean $\Psi$ must be biholomorphic from $G \to \Psi(G)$ for $\chi$ to exist. But, I ruminate that it must be more complicated than that. Clearly if $g = f(f(z))$ then there does exist such a map. Simply take the identity function $\chi = \text{Id}$. It follows similarly if $g$ is in some other orbit of $f$. This follows regardless if $\Psi$ is biholomorphic. I wonder if maybe these are the only particular cases. That it only really happens if $\Psi$ is invertible or $\chi = \text{Id}$. To make sense of this statement it might help to restrict ourselves to rational maps taking $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ to itself, and letting $G$ be the immediate basin of attraction about a geometric fixed point $z_0$. If there is some $g$ on $G$, and it has its own Schroder function $\Phi: G \to \Phi(G)$, assuming there exists $\chi$ between $f$ and $g$: then $\Psi$ is biholomorphic, or $\chi = \text{Id}$. But then, I think mathematics is too ingenious for that, there's got to be more to the story. 

This question, although appearing deceptively easy, has resisted many attacks against it. The question, being simple to state, is something rather non-trivial that is rather crucial towards more general work. Rather than working around the question (which is kind of possible in the scenario I'm in), I thought I'd post it here to see if someone else has a crack at it and it breaks. Consider a function $\phi$ that is holomorphic on an open set $G$ sending to $G$. Let us assume that $\phi(0) = 0$ and $0<|\phi'(0)| < 1$ and $\phi^{\circ n}(\xi) \to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ for all $\xi \in G$. Then necessarily the sum $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \phi^{\circ n}(\xi)$$ converges normally on compact subsets of $G$. This is simple to show, as for all compacts of $G$, for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such when $n > N$ $$|\frac{\phi^{\circ n}(\xi)}{\phi'(0)^n} - \Psi(\xi)| < \epsilon$$ so that $$|\phi^{\circ n}(\xi)| < |\phi'(0)|^n (||\Psi(\xi)||_\infty + \epsilon)<Cr^n\,\,\,\,\,0 < r < 1$$ Now the question I pose is a slight alteration of this problem. Let us assume $\phi$ is holomorphic on $G$ sending $G$ to itself, $\phi(0) = 0$ and $\phi'(0) = 1$. Let us take $\mathcal{S}$ to be the set such that $\phi^{\circ n}(\xi) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ for all $\xi \in \mathcal{S}$. Does $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \phi^{\circ n}(\xi)$$ converge for $\xi \in \mathcal{S}$? Convergence can be pointwise, normal, or uniform. Pointwise would be sufficient but normal or uniform would be even better. I do believe this follows (it seems to work in most cases that I've tried). Letting $\eta = e^{1/e}$ for example, if $f(x) = \eta^{x+e} - e$ then $f(0) = 0$ and $f'(0) = 1$. The line $(-\infty, 0]$ satisfies $f^{\circ n}(x) \to 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The function $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \eta^{\eta^{...(n\,times)...^{\eta^{x}}}}-e$$ converges for $x \in (-\infty,e]$. I thought using the contraction property might work, that $|\phi(\xi)| \le |\xi|$ but I haven't gotten much luck. Namely for all $1 >|\xi| > \delta$ we have a $0 < q_\delta < 1$ such that $|\phi(\xi)| \le q_\delta|\xi|$ but as $\delta \to 0$ it is necessary $q_\delta \to 1$ so that $|\phi^{\circ n}(\xi)| < (\prod_{i=1}^n q_{\delta_i}) |\xi|$ with $|\phi(\xi)| > \delta_{i+1}$ when $1>|\xi| > \delta_i$. therefore we would need to show $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \prod_{i=1}^n q_{\delta_i} < \infty$, and I can't think of any plausible manner of proving this. Any help, comments, suggestions or further questions on what else I can say are welcome and greatly appreciated. Thanks a bunch, I hope someone has an answer or suggestion for this. 

Assume $f$ is an entire non-polynomial function of arbitrarily small exponential order ('zero'th order' if you're into calling it that). Is it possible that for all $n$ we have $$|f^{\circ n}(z)| < M_ne^{|z|}$$ Where $f^{\circ n}$ is the $n$-fold iterate of $f$. This seems a little wonky to actually happen but I'm struggling to find a counter example. I am asking because I suspect it requires a deep result, just like proving there exists a zero'th order function which when composed with itself can be a function of exponential order. Last time, I got an answer for that question here, hopefully someone can aid me in this case as well. I'm wondering if this could be another uniqueness criterion for polynomials in complex analysis. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

I first posed this question when I was a first year student. I came up with some ad hoc arguments as to why the result is true (a bit of numerical experimentation), but never had a proof. I forgot about it until the other day, and thought it was still an interesting question. First, some motivation. Take the expression $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}$$ which equals its own derivative, that much is straight forward. The $x^n$ gets sent to $n x^{n-1}$ and the factorial kills the $n$, and the same expression emerges. We can do the same thing with the integral. $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x^y}{\Gamma(y+1)}\,dy$$ formally satisfies being its own derivative--albeit the expression does not converge (which is a shame). But if you act like it converges, it should converge to $e^x$ because it's its own derivative. This led me to considering a more suitable case, where the integral actually converges, and considering if the two functions agree. For example, $$F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-y^2} \frac{x^y}{\Gamma(y+1)}\,dy$$ defines a $C^{\infty}$ function in $x$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$. This function satisfies $F'(x) = e^{-1}F(\frac{x}{e^2})$. If we take $$G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-n^2}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ then equally so, $G'(x) = e^{-1}G(\frac{x}{e^2})$.
