Why are we smart? In all likelihood, humans are far cleverer than our evolutionary niche actually requires. Human intelligence probably evolved as a form of sexual selection - peacocks have display feathers, deer have huge antlers and people have humour and deep conversation. A big brain is in many ways bad for us - a smaller one would consume less oxygen, and far more usefully could be much better protected inside a head of the same size. So all you really need is for intelligence to appear attractive to other dragons, and it will appear... and of course dragons being larger can probably better afford the sacrifices. 

The acceleration equation is : with Here you want and So . Which results in w (omega) = 0.4041 rad.s^-1 = 3.86 tr/min 

In order to build this scale, I need some criteria that help evolution or curb it. What are the planet criteria that influence evolution of life ? I know that distance from star, the type of star, presence and composition of the atmosphere, temperature are capital for example. Are there any others ? In what extent are they important ? 

I think the term Artificial Intelligence is widely used... and misused. The problem is even though everybody can agree (at least it is less discussed) on what is "Artificial" : not natural, human-made, which requires skills to make; a lot of people are struggling at defining the "Intelligence". Anyway, the definition I think people should know is the one defined in 2003 by Russel and Norvig. To sum up, they state that an intelligence must "think" or "act" and it can do it in 2 ways "like a human" or "rationally". Thus, it gives you 4 cases in which your question has different answers. 

Well, if "upside down" can mean "sideways" then you could always make the city a large, spinning wheel. A 1km radius spinning wheel rotating at 1rpm should be enough to create Earth-style gravity, then slope the floor at around 1:10 to balance out the gravity of Europa. To leave the city, take a lift (elevator) 'up' towards the centre (which would probably be quite a weird feeling!) and then just step off (remember, although the outside is spinning at over 100ms - around 250mph - the centre is only turning once every minute). If the lift carriage is in a gimbal, then the feeling shouldn't be too odd - the gravity would just gradually reduce until you're at Europa levels. You'd only be able to build around the inner circumference of the wheel though, unless you were happy to accept lower gravity levels as you go 'up'. With that size of structure multi-storey buildings shouldn't be a huge issue though, unless you want to start making Empire State buildings in your city. 

I am not a specialist but I can try : Circumstellar Habitable Zone Based Answer This answer is based on the circumstellar habitable zone. Because the Earth is in the Sun's one, and our spacesuits are efficient in this zone. So my guess is if they are in the HZ of the Pistol Star, the spacesuit should be enough to endure the heat. To calculate the center radius of the HZ, you just have to do , this relies on the fact that the Earth is pretty much at the center of the Sun's HZ, that the Sun-Earth distance is 1 A.U. and that the energy received from a star is inversely proportional to the squared distance from this one. Furthermore, the Pistol Star luminosity is estimated around 1,600,000 L☉, so 1,600,000 times higher than the Sun. So by making . So the center of Pistol Star HZ is around 1.8924e+11 km. I think that a good start, you can get them a bit closer of course, because spacesuits could endure the heat a little closer than just above the Earth. 

Also worth considering religious power, and the fact that it's very hard to be diplomatically significant without at least some power in the other measures. 

One idea worth considering is to give the aliens something that they want, in return for helping you out. Your biggest resource is your technology - and the aliens are probably at the perfect technological stage to use it. Find an alien nation with ambitions, and agree to share technology in return for a place to live. 

I think that the broad categories of instruments would remain, as they are simply ways of making a pleasant noise. Strings, percussion and wind are likely to evolve whatever happens. Past that though, who knows what will happen? The drum is pretty likely to occur, but who knows what might turn up in the strings or wind sections? The more complex the instrument, the less likely it is to turn up in a parallel universe - so a recorder or flute is quite likely, a piano much less so. 

This question does not take into account the Sun effect on the tides, which is in fact greater than the one made by the moon. So this answer explains why removing tides does NOT curb the oceans rising problem I don't think so, because, you are right, when the moon is "above" the ocean, the water is rising. But this additional quantity of water does not come from nowhere, so when the sea level is rising somewhere, it is going down somewhere else. The thing with the ice melting is that you add water to the overall quantity by releasing the water contained in the ice on the land. So by destroying the moon (and the tide effect of the Sun, too) you would just make an average sea level which would be rising over time. 

It's worth noting that in the modern world natural fibres outperform synthetic fibres in some ways. Wool and down are still used, wool generally for its wicking properties as a base-layer and down for dry-cold weather insulation. So the simple answer here is that people continue to use natural fibres because they're the best, and for whatever reason it's easier to harvest them in the natural way than it is to try and manufacture them. Another point to consider is how are you defining 'natural'? It may well be that having worked out what is required from a fibre, that the best way to make it is to genetically engineer an organism to grow it. 

In this school, future wizards will acquire a tremendous knowledge and power. This amnesia is forced to ensure that future wizard will not use this new power to get revenge or satisfy needs they got in their past life. 

Completely non historical answer : It seems that the most convenient way to transport a spear is on the back/on your shoulder. With a string tied to the upper and the lower part of the spear, you just pass your shoulder between the string and the spear and you are good to go. You just have to lean a bit to go through doors. For walking in the forest I think holding the spear with at least one hand is better to avoid to stuck it in a tree. Or you can make a convenient cover, with two straps to use it like a backpack. But it is really less convenient if you have to use it quickly to defend yourself... But depending on the technology used you may make it telescopic, it would be much more convenient to transport. If the weapon is the main one of your character it could be unique and customized, and a telescopic spear could be really cool. 

Without access to dedicated facilities, it's going to be exceedingly hard to make a viable tank. The industrial facilities that you're describing probably aren't going to cut it - to make the protection of a modern armoured vehicle requires the use of some fairly high-tech armour (steel plate is going to be like butter against a 40mm cannon round) and the ability to properly join such materials together (WWI tanks had big problems with bullets 'splashing' between joins in the armour. Then you need the drivetrain - effective armour against a 40mm is going to require something akin to a modern main-battle-tank, at 50-odd tonnes of mass. This will need components designed for such machinery - maybe available if there is re-purposable machinery for construction or agriculture. Weaponry is either: 

I think signal convolution between the sound and a prerecorded shot sound should suffice to determinate that is actually a shot (a trained human can easily separate shot from other sounds), and we admit that this computation is instantaneous. Thus, only the sound travel time must be taken into consideration. The speed of sound at sea level and in ISA conditions (25°C, 1013.25 hPa, ...) is 340.29 m / s, thus the time to reach the cyborg "ear" is $$t = \frac{distance}{speed} = \frac{20}{340.29} = 0.058 s = 58ms$$ The main problem is that sentence is actually false. This is the problem when something has passed the sound barrier, the sound is behind the object. Thus, if your cyborg is shot, the bullet would reach them before any sound does. (In fact the shockwave created just on the tip of the bullet is ahead of the bullet and if you want to hear it you have to listen to the bullet tip... and you don't want to put your ear there). 

I'm not sure that stopping the ship would be that difficult (depending on total size) - consider the Columbia disaster. Getting a spacecraft to survive re-entry is very difficult, so hitting it with a reasonable-sized missile is going to cause very serious problems for the craft. With a large ship there will likely still be bits that reach the surface, but much smaller and with very little accuracy. As long as it's detected at long range and hit well before it begins re-entry, the casualties should be fairly light. 

Given that EMP seems to be effective against the machines and within humanity's grasp; it's hard to understand why they wouldn't just trigger lots of EMPs worldwide.
