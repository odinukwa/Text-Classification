An N-subset $\{x_1,\dots,x_N\}$ of a compact set $X\subset \mathbb R^d$ is called a set of Fekete points (named after Michael Fekete) if it maximizes the product $$\prod_{1\le k<j\le N}|x_k-x_j|\qquad (1)$$ among all such $N$-tuples. When $X\subset \mathbb C$, one can express this product in terms of the Vandermonde determinant. In this case Fekete points are of particular interest in approximation theory (as interpolation nodes). Generally, they have no explicit form and must be found numerically. But there are exceptions. When $X$ is a circle, Fekete points are equally spaced. This is well-known and can be proved like this: we may assume $x_k=\exp(i\theta_k)$ with $0=\theta_1<\theta_2<\dots <\theta_N<2\pi$. For a fixed integer $m$, $1\le m\le \lfloor N/2 \rfloor$, consider the product $\Pi(m)=\prod_{k=1}^N|x_{k+m}-x_{k}|$ with indices taken mod $N$. Since each point $x_k$ appears in just two terms of this product, it is not hard to see that $\Pi(m)$ is maximal when $x_k$ are equally spaced. (Indeed, $\log \sin$ is a concave function.) Now let $X$ be the union of two concentric circles of radii $r$ and $R$. Assume that $N=2n$ is even and that exactly $n$ of the points lie on each circle. With this additional assumption we are not quite in the Fekete problem anymore, but we have an obvious candidate for the maximum - 

There really isn't any need for character theory over non-algebraically closed fields. The Grothendieck group of $KG$ embeds into the Grothendieck group of $\bar K G$ (i.e. of the group ring over the algebraic closure). Therefore all information about a $KG$-module $M$ you could possibly hope to recover from any type of "character of $M$" is already contained in the Brauer character of the $\bar K G$-module $\bar K \otimes M$. Also, the values of the Brauer character of $M$ will lie in the ring of Witt-vectors over $K$. 

Even more is true: Two possible cores of $M$ lie in the same genus, i.e. they become isomorphic in the localization at any prime of $\mathbb Z$. However, I couldn't find an explicit proof of this anywhere in literature Edit: It's Proposition 5.4 in Gruenberg: "Relation Modules of Finite Groups" (though unfortunately there's apparently no online version of this book besides google books). Assume you have two decompositions $M=C_1\oplus P_1 = C_2 \oplus P_2$ with $P_1$ and $P_2$ projective. Assume furthermore that one cannot split off any further non-zero projective summands from $C_1$ and $C_2$. By a theorem of Swan (see Swan: Projective modules over finite groups) $\mathbb Q\otimes P_1$ and $\mathbb Q\otimes P_2$ are free, and therefore so is $\mathbb Z_{(p)} \otimes P_1$ and $\mathbb Z_{(p)}\otimes P_2$ ($\mathbb Z_{(p)}$ denotes the localization of $\mathbb Z$ at $p$; this simply uses the fact that since the columns of the decomposition matrix of a finite group are linearly independent, the isomorphism type of the $\mathbb Q$-span of a projective $\mathbb Z_{(p)}$-module determines the isomorphism type of the projective module; alternatively see Theorem (77.14) on p. 548 in Curtis, Reiner: Representation theory of finite groups and associative algebras). So now apply cancellation for $\mathbb Z_{(p)}G$-lattices (see Corollary 1 in this paper of Reiner) to find that unless $P_1$ and $P_2$ have the same $\mathbb Z$-rank (in which case we would be done), either $C_1$ or $C_2$ (say, w.l.o.g. $C_1$) has a non-zero free summand in every localization. So if this is the case, then take for each prime $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ that divides $G$ an epimorphism $$ \phi_i: \mathbb Z_{(p_i)} \otimes C_1 \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb Z_{(p_i)}G \subset \mathbb QG $$ By multiplying each $\phi_i$ with a sufficiently large integer relatively prime to $p_i$ we may assume $\phi_i(C_1) \subseteq \mathbb Z G $ for each $i$. Now we get a map $$ \phi := \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\prod_{j\neq i} p_j \right)\cdot \phi_i|_{C_1} $$ $\phi$ is a homomorphism from $C_1$ to $\mathbb Z G$, which is an epimorphism in the localization at each $p_i$ (by construction: the factor $\prod_{j\neq i} p_j$ is a unit in $\mathbb Z_{(p_i)}$ and in the radical of each $\mathbb Z_{(p_j)}$. Hence the image of $\phi$ in the localization at $p_i$ is the same as the image of $\phi_i$). The image of $\phi$ in the localization at any other prime is projective anyways, since if $p$ doesn't divide the order of $G$, then any $\mathbb Z_{(p)}G$-lattice is projective. So now we have a homomorphism from $C_1$ onto the image of $\phi$, and the image of $\phi$ is projective in each localization. But then by Theorem (78.1) on p. 550 in Curtis&Reiner the image of $\phi$ is projective, and therefore the image of $\phi$ is a projective summand of $C_1$. This contradicts the assumption that we couldn't split off any further projective summands from $C_1$. 

The minimizer $m$ is the nearest point projection of $X$ onto the subspace of $L^p$ formed by the constant functions ($p=3$ in your case). This $m$ is sometimes called the $p$-prediction or $p$-predictor of $X$. Apparently, this terminology began with Andô and Amemiya. Some of later papers are Landers and Rogge (who wrote a few other papers, e.g. this one), and Cuesta and Matrán. The term "generalized (conditional) expectation" also appeared. 

If $g$ happens to be in $L^1$, then the amplitude of the Fourier transform of $fg$ is bounded by the $L^1$ norm of $g$, for any unimodular $f$. This is the only restriction from above since you can always choose $f$ so that $fg\ge 0$, thus bringing the (essential) supremum of $\widehat{fg}$ up to $\|g\|_{L^1}$. Another part of the question is how small we can make $A$. I guess "arbitrarily small", but don't have a proof. (Except for special case: if $g$ is in $L^1$, then we can chop it into pieces with disjoint supports and small $L^1$ norm, and then use $f$ to move the Fourier transforms of pieces far from one another.) 

Another option is $\sum c_{mn}z^m \bar z^n$, which still keeps track of the complex structure. For instance, harmonic functions will have $c_{mn}=0$ unless $mn=0$. 

Ok, so here's the long version of what I already said in the comments: Start by picking $g_1,\ldots,g_n\in \mathbb C[x]$ such that $g_i\neq g_j$ whenever $i\neq j$ which satisfy the prescribed condition at $0$ (that's not hard). Since $g_i-g_j\neq 0$ for each $i\neq j$, there will be only finitely many $0\neq a\in\mathbb C$ such that $g_i(a)-g_j(a)=0$ for some pair $i,j$ with $i\neq j$. Call these values $a_1,\ldots,a_k$. Then define $$ f_i(x) := \left(\prod_{j=1}^k (x-a_j)^m\right)\cdot g_i(x) $$ Those $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ have pairwise intersection also in $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ (and possibly in $0$), but now with multiplicty at least $2m$ (except in $0$, where the intersection multiplicty is left as it was). The condition at zero is clearly preserved and we didn't add any further intersection points either. 

I assume you are referring to page 78 here. I think the author is only implying that you may drop the condition of $A$ being an integral domain (in favor of it being a ring without nilpotent elements). You should still assume that $A$ is noetherian and local with maximal ideal $I$ (since in the formulation of the corollary left to the reader, the author still refers to the field $k=A/I$, which would be ambiguous otherwise; also there are conditions on $A$ and $I$ in place throughout the entire section which prohibit you from working with an arbitrary ring). So you can apply the criterion for flatness given in Corollary 4.4 to the $A/{\mathfrak p}$-module $M/{\mathfrak p} M$ for each minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ of $A$ (since $A/\mathfrak p$ will be an integral domain again). What you want to show then is that $M$ is flat as an $A$-module if and only if $M/{\mathfrak p}M$ is flat as an $A/{\mathfrak p}$-module for each minimal prime $\mathfrak p$. By the foregoing Corollary 4.3, this is the same as showing that $M$ is free if and only if $M/\mathfrak p M$ is free for any minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ (however, the "and only if"-part is trivial). Here is how I think the proof goes: Since $A$ is local, we may lift a $k$-basis of $k\otimes M$ to a minimal $A$-generating set of $M$ (by Nakayama's lemma). We get an exact sequence $$ A^i \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} A^{dim_k k\otimes M} \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow 0 $$ for some $i\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ and some $\varphi\in A^{dim_kk\otimes M \times i}$. If $\varphi$ is zero then $M$ is free. So assume $\varphi$ is not zero and $x$ is some non-zero entry of the matrix. Because $A$ has no nilpotent elements there is some minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ such that $x \notin \mathfrak p$. Now, by tensoring $$ (A/\mathfrak p)^i \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} (A/\mathfrak p)^{dim_k k\otimes M} \longrightarrow M/\mathfrak p M \longrightarrow 0 $$ with the fraction field $K$ of $A/\mathfrak p$, we see that $dim_K K\otimes (M/\mathfrak p M) < dim_k k \otimes M= dim_k k\otimes (M/\mathfrak p M)$, i.e. $M/\mathfrak p M$ is not flat/free/projective by Corollary 4.4 (i.e., we have shown: $M$ not free $\Longrightarrow$ $M/\mathfrak p M$ not free for some minimal prime $\mathfrak p$). 

This is an extended version of my comment. Suppose we stay on the surface $z^2+w^2=1$ but away from the origin. The identity $|z^2+w^2|^2=|z|^4+|w|^4+2Re((z \bar w)^2)$  tells us that the square of $z \bar w$ has negative real part. The set of complex numbers $\zeta$ such that $Re(\zeta^2)<0$ has two connected components: it's the disjoint union of two open sectors. Finally, note that switch from (z,w) to (-z, w) involves going from one component to the other.  

One can hope that step 2 is doable with standard calculus tools, since there should be no other local maxima for interlaced points. But Step 1 seems to require a more imaginative approach. Why do I find this question interesting? There is a natural way to distribute N points on a circle (i.e., at equal distances), and this configuration is known to give the solution for many extremal problems, such as the Fekete problem, isoperimetric N-gon problem, etc. There is also a natural way to distribute two sets of N points -- namely, by formula (2), but I don't know of any nontrivial problem for which the optimality of such configuration has been established. 

Regarding the part of your question about involutions. I don't think it's always possible to find a maximal order stable under a given involution. For instance, take $F=\mathbb Q$, $A = \mathbb Q^{2\times 2}$ and the involution $$ \sigma: A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M\cdot X^\top \cdot M^{-1} $$ with $$ M=\left(\begin{array}{cc} 2&0\newline 0&1\end{array}\right) $$ Now any maximal order $\Theta$ in $A$ is conjugate to $\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, and therefore all $\Theta$-lattices in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$ are of the form $n\cdot L$ for dome $n\in \mathbb Q$ and some fixed full $\mathbb Z$-lattice L in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$. Note that the determinant of a basis matrix for $n\cdot L$ is well-defined up to sign (since two basis matrices differ only by an element of ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Z)$), and $\det(n\cdot L) = \pm n^2\cdot \det(L)$. In what follows assume $\Theta$ is a maximal order such that $\sigma(\Theta) \subseteq \Theta$. This will lead to a contradiction. For any $S\in{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Q)$ we can replace $M$ by $M' = S M S^{\top}$, $\Theta$ by $\Theta'=S\Theta S^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ by $$ \sigma': A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M'\cdot X^\top \cdot M'^{-1} $$ So assume that $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, $L'=\mathbb Z^{1\times 2}$ and $\sigma'(\Theta') \subseteq \Theta'$. Note that the determinant of $M'$ will be $2\cdot \det S^2$, which is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Now here's the problem: $L'\cdot M'$ is not of the form $n\cdot L'$, since $\det M'$ is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Therefore $L'\cdot M'$ cannot be stable under the action of $\Theta'^\top = \Theta'$. Hence $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \neq L'\cdot M' $$ which implies $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \neq L' $$ which tells you that $$ \sigma'(\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}) = M'\cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \nsubseteq {\rm End}_{\mathbb Z}(L')=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2} $$ which is a contradiction (as $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$ was assumed to be stable under $\sigma'$).
