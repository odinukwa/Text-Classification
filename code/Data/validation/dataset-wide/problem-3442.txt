In a New Keynesian model, under the assumption of sticky prices, we need to express the monetary policy through an equation in order to close the model made of New-Keynesian Phillips curve and dynamic IS curve. I've read that an easy choice is to use the so called Taylor rule, which express the interest rate as a function of inflation (and possibly a random component). But, I've read that it is a suboptimal choice because it is something exogenous, whereas if we endogenously compute the optimal monetary policy we can reach a better result. My question is why using a Taylor rule when we know it is not optimal to do that? 

I am working in a New Keynesian context so that the Phillips curve is usually specified as follows \begin{gather} \pi_t=\beta E_t\pi_{t+1}+\kappa x_t \end{gather} where $\beta$ is the discount factor, $\kappa$ is the slope of the curve depending negatively on the degree of price stickiness in the economy and $x_t=y_t-y^N_t$, with $y^N_t$ is the natural (potential) level of output What is driving me crazy is if this curve, specified as above, still make sense when we assume prices are fully flexible. I would say no, because in a flexible price context, the output gap would be zero and the firms would optimize in a static fashion (no need of taking into account expectations of future inflation). But, I have no idea about how to "transform" the model in this direction. 

A share or stock is part of an individual company. Unit (Trusts) are a collection of different (and usually related) shares. For example, I am currently investing in a Singapore Equity Fund. And this is known as a Unit Trust. And within the Singapore Equity Fund, my investment is made up of different company shares, e.g. the local bank shares, telecommunication company and some other companies. And these Unit Trusts are usually managed by a Fund Manager who belong to a Fund Management Company (or known as Fund House). And there are many different Fund Management Companies in Singapore with their own expertise and knowledge. Source: here 

The problem is the maximization of profit of a firm that produces a differentiated good $i$ using labor $N_i$ as unique input, under the demand function of the consumers (or final goods producers) and the production function. The first three steps are computed by substituting the two constraints and the market clearing condition for goods market $Y_t=C_t$ into the objective function in order to have a free maximization problem in one unknown, $P_{it}$. The FOC for $P_{it}$ is right and the same is true for the next step, where the left hand side is positive because he has divided for $-(1-\epsilon)$, i.e. $(\epsilon-1)$ that you see at the denominator of $\epsilon$. The highlighted part is correct too: this is the derivative of the function nested in the square brackets; he added $\frac{1}{P_t}$ because he kept $\frac{P_{it}}{P_t}$ all elevated at $-\epsilon-1$, this means that $P_t^{-1}$ and $P_t$ goes away. You could also have written \begin{gather} \epsilon\frac{\frac{P_{it}^{-\epsilon-1}}{P_t^{-\epsilon}}C_t}{A_t}=\epsilon\frac{\big(\frac{P_{it}}{P_t}\big)^{-\epsilon-1}C_t}{A_t}\frac{1}{P_t} \end{gather} After the "Continue...", he just sum the two expressions in square brackets because they are exponentials with the same base and in the second step he notice that \begin{gather} \bigg[\frac{\frac{P_{it}}{P_t}^{-\epsilon}C_t}{A_t}\bigg]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}=N_t \end{gather} using again the demand for $Y_{it}$, $Y_t=C_t$ and the production function. The last step is a rearrangement of the previous one (simple algebra) and it is still the FOC for $P_{it}$. If you rearrange it as in Gali, you obtain the optimal pricing condition for the monopolistic firm in flexible price setting. 

I'm going to give a less economically rigorous answer, and address your concern about your own situation. Jobs change. Your skillsets will always need to change. If you are young, it's a certainty that you will not be in the same job, or even the same career, your entire life. It's likely that many of the jobs you will do in life don't exist right now. I've spent most of the last 30 years doing things which it would be hard to get a degree to prepare for, and which would not have shown up on an aptitude test. I expect this will be more true for more people going forward. If you aren't mentally prepared for this pace of change, then you should be scared, and you have some things you need to think through. But if you are willing to be flexible in what you do, willing to engage in life-long learning, willing to accept that school, college, and other formal training are only the bare basics of your education, and the other 90% is up to you, and if you are willing to educate yourself above and beyond what most institutions feel is needed, then you'll be just fine. More about that last point -- it's the institutions, the large organizations, companies, and schools, which should be scared, not you. They can't change tracks nearly as fast as an individual can. What you don't want to do is be caught in one of them when they fail. If these things concern you, then your interest in economics and life should be focused on recognizing the signs of ossification in an organization or in an economy. You need to be able to decide when to lead, and when to leave. If you do neither, then it's a near certainty that you will get caught in a layoff or corporate failure at some point in your life. Which brings us to the main takeaway; it's exactly those organizations who don't use the technology available, who don't adapt rapidly to change, and who don't automate when it makes sense to do so, who you should most fear, and who you should steer clear of. They are the ones who tend to ossify early relative to their competitors, and they are the ones whose members and investors suffer the most when the entire organization fails. Union contracts will not save your job when the entire company fails, and it's never in the union's best interests to resist those things which the organization needs to do in order to survive. So, no, robots alone aren't going to take your job away. If you really want insurance, learn to be one of the many people who design, assemble, install, service, or program them. These things are hard but can be a heck of a lot of fun. Believe it or not, the robotics industry itself is about to get turned on its head, as the big (ossified) players get routed out by thousands of agile startups, many of them based on open source. If you want to be one of them, go to a maker faire near you (google it) and get started. Outsourcing is an entirely different thing, is often a workaround for lack of automation, and in my own opinion has been overdone. Again my own opinion, but based on my own experience running a US-based manufacturing company, I believe many of those who are currently outsourcing are going to see the error of their ways sooner or later, or fail and be replaced by others who don't follow the mantra of "outsource when possible". This problem will correct itself. 

Mere googling leads me to find a bunch of references about elasticity of marginal utility. Here Professor Acemoglu defines the elasticity of marginal utility as the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (pagg. 17-18). Here you can find a question analogous to yours together with an answer explained in an easier way than Acemoglu's lecture. If you are interested in something more empirical, have a look here: it is a paper by David Evans about the empirical estimation of elasticity of marginal utility in OECD countries. Hope this is enough. If you have other questions, please ask 

I am a bit confused about the concept of natural real interest rate. I've read that it is the level of real interest rate consistent with the output being at its potential or natural level and with the inflation being static. Is that true? Furthermore, I do not understand how natural real interest rate is able to affect output and natural level of output (then, the output gap) in the usual New Keynesian framework. I mean the dynamic is curve is defined as \begin{gather} x_t=E_t\{x_{t+1}\}-\frac{1}{\sigma}\{i_t-E_t\{\pi_{t+1}\}-r^n_{t}\} \end{gather} where $x_t=y_t-y^n_t$, i.e. the output gap and $r^n_{t}$ is the natural real interest rate. ($\frac{1}{\sigma}$ comes from a CRRA household utility with elasticity $\sigma$). Thus it seems that an increase in the natural real interest rate leads to an increase in current output gap, but how is this true? Does it mean that natural level of output increases more than output? 

I am trying to study the effects of a policy on educational attainment of individuals (years of schooling, primary/secondary school completion, literacy). Since the policy starts in a specific year I decided to use an RDD using birth year as running variable. The problem is that my sample is made of 5 different countries in which the policy has been implemented in 5 different years. Am I able to pool the effect of the policy across countries? Because if I build a unique running variable as being 0 for each cutoff year I get individuals born in e.g. 1994 having running variable both 0, -2, +3 depending on the country of origin. How can I deal with this issue? Should I run a RD for each country alone? 

Yes, he is referring to a movement along the demand line. If the individual purchases less than $Q_0$, than the demand line would be higher than the price for quantities for $Q_0$, this means that the individual values consumption more than its cost (its price). Graphically, you just need to show that for a quantity less than $Q_0$, the demand line is higher than the price, i.e. the individual values consumption more than its cost. 

My textbook says that sometimes producers are responsible for ensuring that their product is recycled. They are required to buy "credits" from firms that recycle their type of product. It says that the local newspaper company may be required to buy 500 pounds of credits for every 1,000 pounds of newspapers it produces. It would buy its credits from firms such as cardboard box producers that can use old newspapers in producing their product. But I don't understand why a newspaper company should be responsible for recycling newspapers. After all, once the newspaper company sells its newspapers, they belong to the consumers i.e. readers of the newspaper. Shouldn't they be the ones responsible for making sure that the newspaper gets recycled? I guess I don't understand how the newspaper company would buy credits from the cardboard box producer and how that will result in the newspaper, which is now in the hands of the consumer, being recycled. 

If a student successfully completes an MBA program in 2 years, he will earn $50,000 more than what he could earn without the degree for his lifetime. Calculate the present value of this perpetual rise in his income associated with the degree. The rate of interest in the market is 10%. My attempt: He will earn \$50,000 more at the end of his 1st year at the job. Let the present value of this increase be $PV_1$. $\displaystyle 50,000=PV_1\left(1+\frac{10}{100}\right)^3$ The exponent is 3 because he will spend the next 2 years attending the MBA program and be paid at the end of the 3rd year. $\implies 50,000=PV_1\times(1.1)^3$ $\displaystyle PV_1=\frac{50,0000}{(1.1)^3}$ $\displaystyle PV_2=\frac{50,000}{(1.1)^4}$ and so on. $\begin{aligned}[t] PV&=PV_1+PV_2+\ldots \\ &=\frac{50,000}{(1.1)^3}+\frac{50,000}{(1.1)^4}+\ldots \\ &=\frac{50,000}{(1.1)^3}\times\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{1.1}} \\ &=\frac{50,000}{(1.1)^3}\times\frac{1.1}{0.1} \\ &=\frac{500,000}{(1.1)^2} \\ \end{aligned}$ The answer given by the professor is "PV of lifetime increase in salary is $500,000." Where have I gone wrong? 

This statement seems utterly nonsensical to me. Are we actually to believe that large increases in world food production may serve to increase world hunger? Poor farmers using outdated technology may be forced to upgrade or find other jobs, but the lower prices will surely help non-farmers. Thus they (non-farmers) will have more money and this will create new demand and thereby new jobs for farmers who have lost their jobs. Am I right? This isn't the first error I've encountered in this textbook. 

My textbook says, "Some of the best indicators of living standards are the average life expectancies and infant mortality rates already mentioned." How does babies not dying within their first year necessarily indicate that a country has high living standards? It just means that the babies had good parents and adequate access to healthcare. 

A monopolist faces a demand curve given by $P=60-2Q$ and has total costs given by $TC=Q^2$. Now suppose that the country in which this monopolist is located decides to engage in international trade. The world price of the product produced by the monopolist is $10. What is the firm's profit-maximizing output level? My attempt: $P=60-2Q$ $P=10\implies 10=60-2Q\implies 2Q=50\implies Q=25$ Unfortunately, this isn't the right answer. How do I solve this problem?
