This causes friction in the team and their productivity decreases as everyone is harboring personal grudges. Ok so having a meeting first thing in the morning poses problems. Specifically because sometimes there are things out of their control that cause them to be delayed. So first option is push the meeting back 10-20 minutes and keep the punishments, the second option is to keep the meeting where it is but remove the punishments. Keeping the Punishments, moving the meeting O.k so you have decided to move the meeting to allow for unforeseen incidents but you've decided to keep the punishments if people are late. But what about these scenarios? 

A Cover Picture and the cover text would definitely be too much. You're trying to list your relevant skills not make a sale to them. In CV's that are specific and rigid, e.g some companies give you a blank template that you must fill in then placing this in the section called 'Other', this would probably be the best place to list them in this kind of format: 

Emphasise your strengths As always with interviews you should be trying to present yourself in the best light possible. So when it comes to them asking about your 2 year gap don't just say 'Oh I was meeting personal goals' you want to show what you did and amaze them with the transferable skills you learnt. Transferable skills For example did you have to communicate a lot with other people? Has this improved your communication abilities? Are you more clear and concise now? Communication is a skill that is important in every workplace, you will rarely work alone and someone who is able to explain themselves concisely will be a fantastic advantage. Were you frequently presented with difficult tasks? Did you complete them on time to the best of your abilities? Showing that you can handle difficult tasks and still give it 100% of your effort shows that you aren't likely to just give up and stop trying if you are presented with difficult tasks whilst working for them. This is definitely a desired quality to have. Were you presented with conflicts, either in the workplace or with a customer? How did you handle it? Did it go well? Someone who can remain calm and professional whilst in a conflict of any kind will be a very good trait to have, if you have an example of doing this then definitely bring it to their attention. Someone who isn't going to snap at a client in high pressure situations will be a very valuable person to have. Conclusion All in all, as long as you can show what you learnt, and show how this has improved you then I can't see it being too much of an issue. However, on top of this you might want to make sure you have done some sort of training course or tests to bring yourself up to speed. Things change fast in the IT world and 2 years is actually a fairly long time to be out of it. Your biggest challenge probably won't be the 2 year gap, but will be the lack of current knowledge, so make sure you brush up on all of that too to make sure you aren't at a disadvantage! 

I think it is important for both groups to remember that it is a shared space. This means that sometimes there is going to be noise from people talking, but this also means that groups need to be mindful of their volume and impact on the environment around them. There are a couple of options for you to consider in this situation depending on how you want to handle it. Note that most of these will tackle how you can lower your volume, as this is the side of the problem that we can control. 

I would not expect an employer to use information you've listed under hobbies or 'outside of work' activities to determine whether you're the right candidate for the vacancy, especially if it isn't a direct line of work with the job being applied for. There are huge benefits in detailing any interests you have or recreational activities no matter how insignificant you feel they may be. This gives insight into you as a character to a potential employer and a lot can be learned from this. And as you state, another benefit can be that it shows you continue to develop or extend your skillset outside work. As long as you clearly state your level of knowledge with this particular use of working with JavaScript and that your skills in developing basic JavaScript games are still in their infancy then I don't expect this to be held against you during an job application process. 

As part of the recruitment screening process, I'd much prefer to invite a candidate to interview if they have showed an element or personalisation and research into the company for which they're applying for a position at. Generic and templated cover letters are often quite easy to spot as an employer and if they haven't shown any element of research or interest into the company then it doesn't set a great example of how they may be as an employee. This is ultimately one of the main reasons it is considered bad practice. I'd certainly expect the application success rate to be lower using a generic cover letter used to apply for multiple positions in multiple companies with just the odd word changed here and there. With so many out of work and scrambling for any vacancies that arise now, it is more important then ever to 'stand out from the crowd' and take that extra bit of time researching and perfecting your cover letter. Those that cannot be bothered will not be rewarded in most cases. 

As your employer is meant to pay you via a direct BACS transfer as per their terms in your contract of employment, this is reasonable ground to refuse to accept the cheque and request that they make payment via bank transfer. If they genuinely have problems with their bank however, it may be not be possible for them to make payment via this method until the issues are resolved (and you can't get blood out of a stone) so you may not have any option other than to accept the cheque or wait for them to resolve the issues at the bank. Providing you diplomatically explain your reasons for refusing the cheque due to failure to pay you on time, I would expect them to understand your grounds and it shouldn't cause any future uneasiness between yourself and the HR department. The bottom line is that it is the employer that is not adhering to their own terms of contract which places greater weight on your side. 

I'd also be inclined to refuse to sign the contract based on the inability to know what might happen in the next 12 months. An unforeseen circumstance could arise that prevents you from remaining in that particular employment and you don't want to take any risk that you may be lumbered with hefty reimbursement of employee training costs. Unless of course, you see something else in the provided contract that gives you good grounds to refuse to sign it. 

Punishing people for things that are out of their control will only cause disarray in the team and cause unnecessary friction in an already busy or high pressure environment 

The answer to this is 'Yes' Where I work we have an estimating sheet mocked up in Excel, we split the task into subtasks, e.g development, testing, deployment, and then maybe split them into smaller sections. e.g develop webpage, develop app, etc etc. Then we estimate for each small segment and mark down the time we think each will take individually. Then the excel sheet calculates the overall time in another cell. Then this is given to the manager who will look over it, discuss it with you, perhaps try to refine it a bit more, then submit it to wherever it needs to go to. This has many advantages, a few of which i will touch on here. Number One: This approach forces you to think of each individual task and its difficulty, which means you estimate for each task. This avoids the problem where you prematurely optimize, for example you say 3 days, but to you that sounds too much, so you cut a day off and make it two days. Whereas if you do it bottom up you can say well this will take X days, this will take Y days, and you will see the grand total. This forces you to think about each task and allows you to provide more accurate estimates for the work load. Number Two: This approach means that both you AND your manager get a say in the process. You can estimate it for yourself, and discussions with the manager may lead to revelations you were unaware of and the estimate can be refined. This also means you and your manager end up with an estimate you BOTH agree on and there is less hassle over when the deadline is, how long it should take etc as you have already agreed to one. Number Three: This gives you the best of both worlds in an estimate, your knowledge of your own skills as well as your managers knowledge of the overall project and potential pitfalls. Number Four: This forces you to think about your estimate. You wont randomly pick a number out, your thought process on each task will lead you to have to think about each task, this makes it much much easier to justify to your boss because you yourself have thought about the potential pitfalls and this is then much easier to explain to them why it is X days rather than Y hours. Which can potentially lead to a better understanding of how things work from your manager, as well as the added bonus of more accurate estimates. An alternate approach is to document the changes you do (which you shouldbe anyway) and keep a note of how long each one has taken you. This way when you are given a similar task again you can see how long it took you last time and use that as a basis to work off of. This also gives you the added bonus of being able to say to your boss 

This puts the ball in his court, it gives him the chance to make a decision and he is not allowed to answer never, as it is against your contract (and in most places, the law) to give 0 holidays. Of course, only say the above for those times when you don't mind when holiday is. For the times when you do mind, try to adhere to the points above. If he consistently refuses you holiday for the times specified politely ask why. If he doesn't have a good reason and is saying no just to be mean, take it up with HR.
