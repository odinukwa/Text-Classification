I've been working on a software project for a few months now with a very small team (and by small, I mean there was an extended period of time where I was the only developer). Our working dynamic is excellent for the most part, as each developer has a different sector that they work in (frontend, backend, database, etc.) and there's very little overlap, so conflicts are minimal. Recently we brought another developer in to do work in another area on the project, and thus far their work has been great. However, they are starting to reach out and alter code in other people's spaces, including my own. While the code they're writing isn't broken, it introduces some clashes, such as when they started rewriting some of the frontend/backend architecture without consulting anyone. The biggest benefits of having each person "own" a certain portion of the code is that 1) everything in that portion of the code has a similar logic and style to it, making it more easy to understand, and 2) the person working in that area can be sure they have absolute understanding of all the moving pieces in that section. That's something that is starting to change with this new development. While I am not the manager or owner of the project, I am the team lead, so I think this falls into my area of responsibility. So my questions are: 

I've been dealing with a bout of laryngitis all weekend on top of allergies, which resulted in me staying home sick today. I expect the allergies will clear up soon, but I don't know how long it will be until I have my voice back. I'm wondering if it would be best to work from home until my voice has fully returned. You're supposed to rest your voice and drink warm fluids while recovering from laryngitis, and I feel like both of these would be made difficult if I went into work. On the other hand, I'm not contagious, and since I'm a coder my ability to do my job is barely impacted at all by not being able to speak, except for when I can't speak in meetings or what have you. That makes me think I'm being excessive by wanting to stay home, especially since the company encourages face-to-face interaction with other employees as that makes it easier to collaborate and solve problems. TL;DR I have a non-contagious medical affliction that doesn't really prevent me from doing my job, but going into work will make it more difficult to recover from. Should I work from home until I have recovered? 

Ignoring these bullet points was the fast track to failing the interview, was the impression that I got. The takeaway here is that the ability to seek out help and ask questions is a highly desirable quality in an engineer. This applies to both asking your colleagues and asking the internet, including Stack Overflow. I personally would be wary of any engineer who insisted on getting everything done themselves, because it probably means that 1) they don't work well with others, or 2) their code isn't as good as it could be. Additionally, every programmer I know uses Stack Overflow, including myself. I have two SO tabs open right now. 

"How many incidents do I have to log before it's appropriate to file a complaint against him?" One. If your boss were simply standoffish or abrasive, I would say to try ignoring it and deal with it in other ways. Threatening to physically assault a team member is unacceptable beyond a shadow of a doubt, and a single instance of this is too many. Given what was said to you, I would skip talking to your boss about it and go right to his superior. EDIT: you could also go to HR if you are not sure your boss's boss will take care of the issue. 

If you truly feel that her behavior is making the work environment uncomfortable for you, you should bring it up with your manager. Don't specifically ask them to take action, but mention that you feel uncomfortable being around this behavior, and ask your manager what the best solution would be. If they feel the behavior is inappropriate, they'll probably ask your co-worker to tone it down. If they think the behavior is fine, they'll hopefully offer some sort of alternative that will make you feel more comfortable at work, at least. If you can ignore this behavior and let it slide, though, I would recommend that as your first option. Sitting on a male co-worker's armrest hardly qualifies as adult movie material, and it doesn't seem like others are too bothered by it. If she starts to invade your personal space, or physically touch you, you can take it up with her right then, and escalate if she continues. 

I have a coworker at my place of work that I am somewhat friendly with. Often times when I pass his desk, we'll both say hi and talk for a couple minutes about this or that. We're not exactly close friends, but it's fun talking to him. I cannot remember his name. As far as I can tell, there is nothing at his desk to indicate his name, as many other employees have. Looking at his badge would be too obvious, as badges here are generally attached to belt loops, and I'd have to lean in to get a good look, and that would be extremely weird. Should I tell this person that I can't remember his name? Would that be insulting to him to say that I've forgotten? Should I just let it go and leave them as Mystery Coworker in my mind? We don't directly work together, so I don't think I would ever need to know his name. I'm not sure what the best move is here. 

The real issue here isn't that the interviewer brought up wages too early. The issue is that you agreed to a wage that was too low for you to live on, and you had that hanging over you instead of ending the interview or resolving the wage problem. 

In the resume workshops I've been to, they always say to be specific about your soft skills, and to give concrete examples of you performing these skills. The example they gave (for a head waitress job) was "can stand for long periods of time;" instead, one should write "had several shifts at X where I stood for eight consecutive hours." Just listing a skill is something anyone can do, and since "strong leadership" is impossible to quantify or double-check in itself, anyone can write things like that. If you're able to get more specific, do so. 

I have never interviewed with a company that allowed me to share what questions I had been given; in fact, if I do so, I run the risk of being disciplined or terminated. If you share the interview questions that are asked, then those questions effectively become useless to the company, as part of the purpose of a technical interview is to see how well you can think on your feet. It would certainly be unethical, and there's a good chance that it will violate your terms of employment. I suspect that you would be better off telling him about broad concepts that he might be asked about, and telling him to study them. Employers often give you this sort of information before the interview anyway, at least in my experience. As for whether or not you did right: I don't think lying about this particular situation is going to be a problem. Simply saying "I can't tell you what the questions were" might have been the better option, and maybe stress that there would be repercussions for you if you did so. But I wouldn't worry too much about your actions here, as they were more ethical than telling him the questions you were asked. 

If you find yourself regularly waiting hours for a code review, this is normal, in my experience. You're doing the right thing by moving onto other tasks in the meantime, even if you have to do some annoying merges. As other answers have noted, smaller batches of code are more likely to get reviewed quickly (and the reviews are likely to be of better quality, as well). If you find yourself regularly waiting days for a code review, then that starts to turn into a major productivity issue, especially if everyone else on the team also has to wait days for a review. Since you say this is a relatively new strategy for your team, I would suggest talking to your manager about how to encourage quicker turnaround. Maybe there could be a quick meeting where good review practices are discussed, both for the reviewer and the author. Occasionally my manager at work has to remind our team not to keep others waiting forever for code reviews, as well. 

EDIT: the wording of my question has led several people to believe that we are intentionally obscuring how parts of the code work so that only one person understands it. This is not at all the case. We have learned the hard way the importance of spreading knowledge around. We have daily stand ups and source control. What I mean is that we have one person working on particular sections of the code, because 1) it is easier to create consistent code that all operates in a similar manner, and 2) again, we are a very small team with a not-small task on our hands, and a harsh deadline. Specialization, combined with regular communication, breeds efficiency. FURTHER EDIT: I suppose a better phrasing would be "how do I politely tell a coworker to only focus on his assigned tasks?" 

Yes, you should. I see nothing crass or out-of-bounds about this request. You aren't taking anything from her, and if you're getting the recommendation of multiple supervisors above you, you aren't trying to overstep your capabilities. If you've already gotten one letter of recommendation, then the worst result I can imagine is that she will decline to recommend you. Let her know that you are interested in her position when she vacates it and ask if she might endorse you. 

I recently got a raise, which is great. However, I got my paycheck today and it seems to indicate that my raise is double what they told me it would be. My first instinct is that they are trying to make the raise retroactively apply to the previous pay period, but in case the next paycheck has a similar overpayment, what should I do? I've asked others and they told me I shouldn't say anything about it, because the only possible change is that I get less money. But my concern is that they will discover an error and demand repayment. Can they force me to repay it all at once? Do they garnish wages over time instead? Should I be putting this excess money away if I don't bring it up? Basically, what is the worst thing that can happen if it turns out I am being overpaid by accident? EDIT: someone suggested this was a duplicate of another question, but that other question is specifically asking about the tax ramifications of overpayment bumping someone up to another tax bracket. This question has nothing to do with taxes. 

When I was looking up advice on how to do well in a coding interview, especially for a company like Google, there were a couple things that were hammered into my head constantly as must-do items:
