Train smarter not harderâ„¢. On a serious note, most workouts plans can be finished within an hour. Even bodybuilding workouts generally don't take that long. Mostly because if you have enough energy to go two hours, then you probably aren't challenging yourself enough in the first hour. Also there is a period of diminishing returns in which more work doesn't necessarily mean more gains. Having said all that, the question is about energy. Some workouts you just feel sluggish and need a boost. Energy can be best derived from fat and carbs. Carbs will give you a quicker, faster boost. Simple carbs (sugar) will give you a much quicker boost of energy that goes away quicker. Complex carbs (vegetables, potatoes, grains, oats, beans, etc.) will give you a longer, more sustained energy. While fat can give you even more prolonged, sustained energy. So, before a workout, it would be beneficial to have a bit of both complex carbs and/or fat. I'm not sure what is easily available in India or what kind of dietary restrictions you have. I personally like eggs and oats. Eggs are a very good source of healthy fats and proteins. Oats are a very fibrous, complex carbohydrates which is great for a sustained energy. During more intense workouts, I will eat jellybeans which are basically pure sugar which is a simple carb for a much faster energy boost. About 30 grams spread throughout the workout is enough. You can substitute for whatever food you like/have access to which follow similar macro-nutrients. Also use this advice as a guideline rather than a strict rule to follow. Not everyone responds the same so you should experiment with different variations to know what works best for you. (Some people workout better on a completely empty stomach for example.) 

Aside from the already mentioned Crossfit, I'd recommend reading up with my personal favorite Home Workout Bible. It has good exercises and routines for a variety of goals and differing available equipment. Cooking as a student is hard. You might want to look at something like Zonya's which focuses on healthy, quick to prepare meals. Most are scaled for four people, but you can get some down to one or two portions. She also includes useful nutrional information so you can use it to make plans about what you should be eating, not just what sounds good. 

Most gyms have personal trainers for hire. They'll know the lay of the land and what equipment you can use to achieve your goals. Typically they want you to sign up for a contract of several (6-12) sessions, but you can usually make it clear you just want someone to set-up a routine for you and not be your new workout buddy. 

Pick up Men's Health Best Weight-Free Workout. It contains 10 simple and short strength training routines that are excellent for beginners. Pick one like the 22-Minute Total-Body Plan and do it three times a week along with enough cardio to make it 45 minutes. That routine won't bulk anyone up, but the light resistance training will put some muscles that will help with your goals and your heart rate should be in a good range for the entire time. 

Cooking (whether baking, frying, grilling, or using a microwave) has a nominal effect on the nutritional value of foods. Using the uncooked data for calculating the post frying impact is fine. 

During training, modern athletes can use GPS watches to track distance and times. The old-school way would be to map out a route pre-mapped out route with known distances and record the start and stop times. This is of course still used in countries like Kenya. For races, they're tracked by the operators of the race. Modern marathons will put a small chip in your bib that records when you cross the start line and when you cross the finish line. There may also be checkpoints in the middle of the race that record your times at specific points. All world records must be run during an official race that follows a strict set of guidelines to ensure time tracking and distances are accurate. Typically international competitions like the Olympics have officials on site to judge a successful record. So you can't just call up some official at the Guinness Book of World Records and tell them you ran a marathon in 1 hour. The official rules state: 

Learn the rules It may be surprising, but there is no universally set rules for powerlifting competitions. A powerlifting competition sponsored by a federation must follow the federation's rules, but each federation may have different set of rules. A powerlifting competition that's hosted by a gym and not sponsored can have their own sets of rules. Most will be about the same, but it's best not to make assumptions. 

The health aspect of the question would get a better response in the Health.SE site. Is it a good idea for a workout? Pretty much every single "energy supplement" uses pure sugar as its base. They also typically include caffeine, b-vitamins, and other things, but the main active ingredient is the sugar. So it is widely used. Powerlifters will eat pure-sugar candy like gummy bears when they need explosive power for their heaviest lifts. Endurance athletes will use gels, or pure-sugar candy to sustain energy through their longest workouts. However, I would suggest not becoming reliant a supplement to get you through a workout. It sort of defeats the purpose of training (in my eyes. Other opinions may differ). You also shouldn't really need a supplement to get you through every workout. Becoming reliant is usually a sign of another problem like: 

It is important to note that in and of itself lifting weights will not cause you to gain weight. You gain weight by eating more than you need. Exercise will change your body composition (fat->muscle). It sounds like you have both going on. 

The Mayo Clinic recommends 150-minutes per week. Different sources will give slightly higher or lower numbers, but this seems to be the mean. The minimum I've heard for any benefit is 5 minutes which leaves very little room for excuses. 

The fact is that nothing remains constant in the body. After any training period your muscles will go through a recovery phase, followed by a supercompensation phase. If you train or seriously exert yourself again towards the end of the supercompensation phase, those phases will repeat. If you do nothing, muscle atrophy will begin. The rate will be slow even if completely bedridden, but it will occur nonetheless. The big question then is how long is the supercompensation phase. And like all big questions, the answer is complicated. It depends on what type and intensity of training you've been going through, how long the macro cycle of training has been occuring, and how close to your body's potential you are currently performing at. For practical purposes, most people can easily take a week off without suffering significant setbacks. 

Arguments about low-carb vs. low-calorie diets aside, going much below your recommended daily calorie intake will send your body into starvation mode. This is bad and counter productive to your goals. 

Glycogen. Glycogen is stored glucose that your muscles use to move explosively. Moving heavy weights requires a lot of energy to be expended really fast. Your muscles use the stored glycogen to get that energy. You deplete it throughout the day, and you won't replenish it if you don't eat. Then you don't have enough when you workout, and you feel exhausted. When you have a big feast, you replenish the glycogen and then use it in the workout. It's equivalent to "carb-loading" in the running world. Being heavy/obese doesn't necessarily equate to being stronger. There's actually a question on this forum that deals with that topic in much greater detail than I'll ever be able to answer. I can't for the life of me find it right now. Though, a more heavyset person is more likely to have topped out glycogen stores simply because they would typically eat beyond their needs. They would experience the same phenomenon you are describing now. 

You have to pay more money for it. Though it is a one time purchase. You have to carry the thing around. You have to make sure you remember it on the day you are going to use it. You have to protect it from other people who may try to use it. Either they think it's community equipment for everyone or they're just jerks. 

Most forms of high intensity cardio can still be pretty damaging to the body. Especially running which I assume is what you're going to do based off the question. The constant pounding on the ground and the hard pushes take a lot out and require recovery. So, yes, it is possible that high intensity cardio limits your ability to recover between lifting sessions. It is also possible that the additional cardio makes you too exhausted to fully complete the sets you need during your next lifting session. That isn't to say you can't do it at all. You just need to be smart about it. High intensity cardio on the same day as lifting will allow for full recovery between sessions. It can be regarded as assistance work for the strength training (because it is). Make sure you do it after the lifting session, or a few hours before so you're not exhausted when you need to lift. 

Yes, but depending on your goals (i.e. strength gains versus endurance) it may make more sense to add extra weight. Edit: If your goal is to burn a specific number of calories, increasing weight or reps won't provide any benefit. If the goal is increase strength, size, power, or endurance doing more work than normal will get you closer to overload where the micro trauma occurs that allows for muscle growth (assuming your diet and rest periods will accommodate the growth). The proper balance of weight versus reps depends on which type of muscle fibers (i.e. slow twitch, fast twitch A, or fast twitch B) you want to encourage. 

Simple answer: hip adduction. Use a machine or lie on your side and lift your lower leg up. Generally, there are lots of stabilizer muscles (e.g. obliques) that don't get exercised properly and lead to injuries of weekend athletes. Specifically targeting them with exercises like hip adduction/abduction and roman twists can help. Using free-weights with uneven loads or exercising only one side at a time can also help tremendously. 

In the progression from vague to measurable, it becomes very clear what you would measure and what success and failure look like at different points. So the first step is to define what it means to be fit for you. Weight is common, but, as you've noted, being an ideal weight while still having too much fat isn't great fun. Measuring body fat with either quality calipers or an electronic tool is more complicated, but can still be done quickly. You can quickly find age and gender appropriate body fat percentages to shoot for. I also include strength and endurance in my fitness goals. For that I just look at my exercise log. I have four exercises with specific weight and rep goals that mark fit or unfit. When you try and set your goals, take a baseline of what you can do today and try to raise it by 20% in three months (six if you've been working out hard for awhile). Shooting for that will give you an idea of your potential. Finally, I include hours of sleep per week in my assessment. Many of us don't exercise just for the fun of it, the goal is to be healthy. Getting proper rest is key to that and many people foresake proper sleep the same way they ignore the expanding waist line. Shoot for 56 hours per week (8 per night) and see how close you can get. It is actually very hard, but will go a long way towards helping what ever other goals you set. 

Who says they don't? Partial squats would be something like pin squats. Partial deadlifts would be something like rack deadlifts. The pull-ups you described sound something like a stomach pull-up or a sternum pull-up (or in the case of that video, a sternum chin up). Although, if you put your back to a wall and slid your arms down against it, I'd wager your hands would only reach to your shoulders (hence "full ROM"). Sometimes a lot of arguments regarding range of motion are semantic. For example, a pull-up by definition is done from full extension of the arms to where the bar touches your chest. If you manage to go further then that, then it is not a pull-up. In the case of a competition lift, there is a set rule regarding what is considered a "rep". This is the case of a squat in which the crease of your hip must be below your knee-cap. Generally speaking, full-range of motion is going to be more effective. The time-under-tension is longer. There's more muscle activation. Though, that doesn't mean partial reps don't have their place. You just need to utilize them for a reason as long as that reason isn't "Because I'm delusional about my physical ability." 

The motor indicates how fast and smooth the treadmill will be able to sustain a continuous belt speed. Some treadmills simply can't "keep up" and the runner can move faster than the belt can go. In which case, the runner will be forced to slow down. 3.0 CHP seems to be the base for "running speed". Track stars looking to stay in from the ice may need something bigger. Otherwise it may be suitable for most people. Although, runners who constantly train at steep inclines, and/or larger runners (200+ lbs) may need a slightly more powerful motor. Larger roller size on the other hand benefits the life of the treadmill. Wider rollers means the rollers themselves spin slower so there's less wear-and-tear over the course of a run. They have larger bearings so they can handle more pressure. Larger rollers are just flat out stronger. Then finally larger rollers have larger surface area to grab on to the belt which prevents the belt slipping (an especially annoying occurrence). I don't know which one you should go as it's entirely based on your needs. If I was treadmill shopping, I would test out the 3.0 CHP treadmill at a slight incline to see if it struggles. Possibly even steeper incline than I would normally run so I know it's more than capable of handling my regular training. Then get the one with bigger rollers if it passes all the checks.
