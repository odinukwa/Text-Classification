A fire brigade reservoir is a supply of water that can be pumped at a fire. They are often used in places where fire hydrants are not available or are insufficient to meet the demand. For example, where people get their water from a well rather than a municipal source. As a practical matter, almost any water can be used (although some may be easier to use). So if that was something that collected water, it could be a fire brigade reservoir. That is true even if it was also used as a swimming pool. My point being that it being a fire brigade reservoir would not prevent it from being a swimming pool. Or vice versa. They are not mutually exclusive uses. In regards to whether this particular water was actually a swimming pool, I have nothing to add to the other answer. Additional sources: 

Politifact evaluated a number of claims from Trump's press conference, including this one. They referred back to a campaign fact check where they rated a similar claim Mostly False: 

If you do the math, this gives 71% Mostly False or worse (False and Pants on Fire) versus 29% Half True or better (Mostly True or True). So on the face of it, the 22% statistic is currently wrong, although it may have been facially correct at the time it was originally posted. What is truth? This hides a bigger problem. Politifact in particular and fact checkers in general do not measure truth. They measure factual inaccuracy. Some factual inaccuracy may be lies. That's essentially the purpose of the Pants on Fire rating. That's when a politician says something knowing that it is not true. Most factual inaccuracy is just that though. Someone says something that is an exaggeration or misleadingly stated. For example, this question title currently says: "Did Donald Trump only tell the truth in 22% of his fact-checked statements?" That is a misleading restatement of "only 22% were rated 'true'. (78% were rated 'mostly false' or worse.)." Mostly False used to be called Barely True. Such statements contain a kernel of truth. From the definition of Mostly False: 

TL;DR: That's not how fact checks work. The stats Politifact has a Trump page which as of right now (October 4th, 2016) says 

To claim racism here, you have to argue not that police are deliberately targeting black people to be killed but that they are more negligent when potential victims are black than white. That's certainly possible, but it is rarely what people are discussing. Are there other explanations? Certainly. By the same kind of metric, crime is more likely to occur in black neighborhoods than white neighborhoods. As such, situations where an innocent bystander is killed are more likely to happen in black neighborhoods (where the criminals are). Some measures that support explanations other than racism: More white people than black people are killed by police. In the Washington Post data this was 494 to 258 (a ratio of just over 1.9:1). From the Department of Justice as published by National Review: 

No. This has the causality backwards. Increased polarization leads to unbalanced vote shares. See for example, the Real Clear Politics published Gerrymandering Isn't to Blame for D.C. Impasse: 

If you don't trust corporate sources, note the Mayo Clinic link that says the same thing. Avoid brushing teeth immediately after exposing them to acid. That source doesn't mention vomiting, but here's a link from a bulimia support group that does mention vomiting. It agrees with your original source. Do not brush your teeth immediately after vomiting. Rinse with water (can add baking soda) instead. A more formal research overview says 

Of course, they are talking about something different than what Donald Trump is claiming. They are talking about broad overviews in non-experimental context (i.e. instead of dividing cities randomly into sanctuary/non-sanctuary, the cities divide themselves). Trump is discussing individual events, e.g. Kate Steinle's death. If that particular illegal immigrant who was not deported as a result of a sanctuary policy had been deported instead, that particular victim would likely still be alive. According to the first paragraph of that quote, they've also debunked the competing narrative that sanctuary cities have less crime because immigrants are more willing to work with authorities. Or the narrative that sanctuary cities have more reported crime (if not necessarily more actual crime) because immigrants are more willing to work with authorities. The net impact on crime is not statistically significant in either direction. Perhaps multiple narratives are true but they cancel each other. Or perhaps this study is flawed (in either direction). Crime studies are inherently difficult, as laws don't lend themselves to experimentation. 

The remaining seven were each from different states, some of which were partially or completely Republican controlled. However, note that two thirds of the top twenty-one (fourteen) were Democrat dominated, even without including Massachusetts and Washington. What do these twenty-one districts have in common? They were all in major cities: New York City; Los Angeles; Chicago; San Francisco; Oakland; Buffalo; Miami; Atlanta; Philadelphia; Boston; Detroit; Seattle. There are multiple measures of gerrymandering, which have different bases and which may conflict: 

Another way of saying this is that the number of guns per gun owner is increasing faster than the number of gun owners (on a percentage basis) is decreasing. 

It's also worth noting that what Rasmussen recommends using at this point in the election cycle is not the overall approval but what they call the Approval Index. The Approval Index is the difference between those who strongly approve and strongly disapprove. Trump is at -11 on that index as of June 16th, 2017. 

We're stuck relying on Tesla for the 130 million miles number. They're the only ones who aggregate that data. For the other US cars, we can consult Wikipedia, which refers us to NHTSA (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration). In 2014, there were 32,675 fatalities in 3,026 billion miles traveled. That's 1.08 fatalities per 100 million miles (from source). Calculating as million miles per fatality, we get about 93 million miles per fatality for 2014. In the next software update after the accident, Tesla said that they made changes including: 

It all depends on your definition of "school shooting". As others have noted, if you use the definition of a firearm discharge at a school, the original statistic is correct. Parkland was the eighteenth incident of an unauthorized firearm discharge at a school in 2018. But that's not what we'd normally consider a "school shooting" in the context of Parkland or Columbine. Axios used a different definition: 

Note that the trump-email.com server was replaced with trump1.contact-client.com which is owned by Cendyn. Anyway, the evidence is that Cendyn manages marketing campaigns for hotels. Alfa Bank has used the Trump hotels. The server that Cendyn manages for Trump hotel marketing sent them some follow-up emails. The bank did some kind of follow-up, either automatically or manually (or both). 

So Republicans added five "Highly Partisan Districts" during the redistricting cycle of 2010-2012. And seven if we count from 2000 (which includes two redistricting cycles. This is noteworthy because prior to that, it was Democrats who controlled redistricting in most states. It's only the last couple censuses where Republicans have been able to gerrymander more than Democrats. The Washington Post Redistricting Scorecard used to show the same five seat advantage for Republicans in the last redistricting. It's worth noting that both of these include North Carolina. Why is that important? Democrats controlled the state legislature and governorship in North Carolina in 2001 when the last redistricting had been done. And they gerrymandered the heck out of it. So about half the gains in North Carolina in 2012 were not from the introduction of a Republican gerrymander but from the elimination of the Democratic gerrymander. Fair Vote analyzed the North Carolina districts. They have a plan to combine districts into superdistricts with three to five seats in each. Under that analysis, they found that North Carolina should have a slight Republican lead but that Democrats should be able to win 7-6 in a good year while Republicans could win up to 8-5. The average result would be a 7-6 victory for the Republicans. Note that the actual results swung from 8-5 Democrat to 10-3 Republican. This accounts for the entire improvement from 2010 to 2012 among Republicans, all five seats. Yet half of this was the elimination of the previous Democratic gerrymander. If we knock off two seats, the Republicans would have only gained by three seats by gerrymander. The other two being gained from the elimination of a gerrymander. An analysis on Politics.SE found that under Cook Partisan Voting Index, Republicans did better than their national average in just three more districts in 2008/2012 versus 2004/2008. TL;DR: Republicans gained three to five seats in the 2011 redistricting. depending on how one measures.
