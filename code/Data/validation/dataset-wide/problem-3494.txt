Anecdotally, the story often goes like this: A land owner leases his commercial retail space at an expensive price. The place stays vacant for months or years at a time. Eventually someone decides to lease the place. The rents are very expensive and eventually the leaser goes out of business. 

This is an interesting question. Firstly, I think it would be better to look at rents than housing supply. Rents are the aspect of home ownership that is 'consumed' whereas there is an investment element to home ownership. Housing, as an investment class, is characterised by low vacancy and low yields. The reason for the low vacancy is that future demand is well known (for the most part). Population growth tends to be a pretty stable, and causal, driver of demand. Housing prices, on the other hand, tend to be more of a function of how much people can borrow, and, as a result, are influenced hugely by macroeconomic conditions. Low-interest rates, like we are seeing in much of the world, allow people to borrow more money. 

I think BKay's answer is quite good. I do have something to add. It is worth considering a key benefit to the consumer of billboards (and advertising in general). It can help a consumer search for a product or service advertised. The consumer will only take advantage of this product if it improves their utility. In this way, the knowledge imparted on the consumer by the billboard allows for an increase in utility. In general, an increase in utility is good for the economy. In this case, improving the mechanism of product search allows consumers to find their individual utility maximizing products. The producers also benefit because the best producers get more revenue. The key assumption here is that a billboard allows a consumer to make a more informed decision. 

Long term viability of economies has been questioned. Fiji is the only one approaching independence from aid.. Many Pacific Island economies have found it difficult to achieve sustained economic growth and hence sustained growth in living standards See this link for a brief overview by the world bank. 

More likely, we will see a (potentially painful) transition in the uses of labour. A factory that used to employ thousands will now employs hundreds, possibly eventually only a dozen. These people will seek employment elsewhere and probably find it, either in existing industries or ones that do not yet exist. 

This question is somewhat subjective but I'll attempt to provide an answer. Real GDP is a very useful concept in economics. It provides a very good indicator on the size of an economy. It does have its limitations, some of which you have described. Many economists are interested in measuring populations in different ways. At the moment, social mobility and inequality are getting a lot of attention. In analysing these issues, there is not as much value in observing the real GDP figure. Further treatment needs to be done. Essentially, on a macroeconomic scale, GDP is very useful. When the analysis looks at individuals and concepts like welfare, it takes a far less prominent role in the analysis and other indicators are more commonly used. 

Another error identified in the paper was that they used arrest rate totals instead of a population controlled variable. These errors drastically cheapen the conclusion of a very prominent and controversial paper. 

I ask about the survey results of some prominent Australian economists shown here (Which is a similar Australian-centric version of the very interesting IGM Forum Surveys). The results of the survey surprised me as it isn't what I was expecting. 

There are definitely economic justifications for playing the lottery, even if all (I hope) players understand that it is unlikely to pay off. One such justification is that what you actually buy when purchasing a lottery ticket is the fantasy of winning. Here are a few sources. Lotterys are relatively well understood in economics. 

So inflation concerns itself with the changes in prices over time. Price can be measured by something like the CPI (consumer price index). GDP on the other hand focusses on what can be produced. If you look at the definition, you can see that in calculation real GDP, the inflation rate is essential. Real GDP is GDP controlled for inflation Useful when comparing different years. An increase in inflation can be a driver for increased nominal GDP but not for increased real GDP. This site provides a pretty solid background and isn't too hard to folow.. 

In such a diverse field, there are many other factors to consider. The importance these variables are vary dependent on the type of analysis required. 

In this case, we have clear property rights and since payday loans do exist, we can assume transaction costs are sufficiently low. So we can expect efficient use of resources. Only people who value having cash in the pocket right now higher than their promised income when they get their pay will take the loan. The reason for this is that people often have liquidity issues. People without access to credit cards or other form of collateral may be higher risk of default. Loaners can charge a high price to compensate them from this risk whilst loanees are willing to pay that price because they can't do any better. A more detailed analysis would also consider the predatory nature, a debt trap and also how tricky understanding a short term loan can be for a desperate low income earner. That said, I don't think any of those factors would impact the Coase theorem. None of the Coase theorem conditions are violated here. This source provides a lot of worthwhile discussion. From page 2: 

I'll direct you to wikipedia which has some pretty good information about it. One of the important things about speculative bubbles is that they are very difficult to identify before they burst. It is very difficult to say the market is overvaluing an asset or a change in economic conditions have raised the true value. That said, there are some signs that a bubble is occurring. One of them being an increase in the demand for credit. 

I would consider county-level research macroeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on individuals and firms acting as decision makers. I think, looking at county-level aggregates, you are too high level to look at decision makers. 

There are many other families like the Wakils, who are content leaving their property vacant. This example is largely relating to Australia but it does happen elsewhere. Why would they do that? Surely any rent earned would be better than no rent. My thoughts are: 

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is your best measure of inflation which is (put simply) the change in cost of a representative basket of goods. Each country measures this in a slightly different way. If you are looking for a numerical increase in inflation, you'll be disappointed. A Basic Income has quite a few effects making this difficult to model. There are anticipated significant impacts on labour/leisure as well as consumption bundles. Also, inflation itself is difficult to model. To make things worse, many reserve banks target inflation with their monetary policy. So you're unlikely to ever get any empirical evidence as well. Anyway: Why would increasing income of lower income earners have an inflationary impact at all? An increase in welfare should result in higher incomes. Higher income leads to higher consumption (or quantity demanded) which should lead to an increase in prices. But, this is only a one-off increase, not an ongoing source of inflation. I would be hesitant to call this inflation and would prefer to call it a permanent demand shock. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any estimates of this impact but I would expect it the long term impact quite small. The higher the basic income, the greater the impact. Also worth noting: I can't think why this would be any more inflationary than any other form of welfare. 

Why doesn't this contradict the fact that competitive markets price goods at their marginal cost? Two points here: 

transport to a shopping center can definitely be considered a cost of participating in a market. More intuitively, the idea of a transaction cost involves costs incurred on the consumer other than the direct price of a good. This fits both the definition, and the intention of the definition. 

Using this measure, calling it a boom is a bit much. Another way to cut the data is by comparing it to the ten-year trend of about 1.5%. Growing 80bps above trend looks a bit better. So, to answer your question, depending on how you cut the data, it could be considered booming but I wouldn't. 

There are a few answers. Individuals can place a valuation on any good. If I have a bike and I decide that I value it at \$100. I will sell it at any price $\geq \$100$. This valuation is economically interesting. You can value something without having to transact it. A market can also value goods. Think about supply and demand. The valuation of a good can be the market price. Say a similar bike sells at \$90. That is the market's valuation of a good. 

From what I can tell, the idea of the basic income guarantee is very popular in some circles as an excellent alternative to a lot of modern welfare systems. Has anybody developed a theoretic or empirical model in which minimum income is tested? In this model, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for such a model to be preferred to a more traditional alternative? If anyone has suggested readings on the topic, that would be appreciated as well. 

I can only provide an australian perspective, but we have a variety of consumer confidence sources tracking weekly results. Somewhere in Here is one analysing elections. It shows a very sharp drop in the lead up but it is short lived. There is evidence that this impacts the stock market. Shane Oliver wrote about the 2013 australian election, the 2016 Australian election and the Italian election. The most interesting is probably the one published around the 2013 Australian election as it looks at the impact on stock markets. Those sources should be a good starting point. There's a good amount of research going around. The basic gist is that mood is impacted for sure but how important this mood swing is is unclear.
