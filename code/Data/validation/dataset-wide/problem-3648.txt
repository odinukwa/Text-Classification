Unless you are already strong, this is the wrong plan. Putting bodybuilding before strength training does not make any sense. Strength Then Bodybuilding Virtually everyone in the strength and bodybuilding community agrees: one becomes a bodybuilder by developing a base of strength and mass first, then targeting specific muscles and body-composition work. This means that at first you should use a program that will get you stronger and bigger as fast as possible. When the gains from that program have been exhausted, then you switch to a bodybuilding routine such as described above. Arnold's Beginner Program From Muscle & Brawn: 

You're splitting your attention between pull-ups and whatever 3x5 program you're doing, which negatively affects progress in both. Focusing on one could help. But if your goal is a higher pull-up max, then by golly you should try doing more pull-ups! Three sets to "maximum reps minus one" per workout, in at least three workouts a week, would be a start. I've also found success with setting total volume goals: 50 reps a day in as few sets as possible, and when I can meet that goal consistently in 3 sets, make it 60. If there isn't room in your workout for one of those strategies then there isn't room in your program for this pull-up goal. This is in addition to any potential problems with your form, e.g. bouncing, kipping, swinging, not doing a full dead-hang, and so on. 

The goal when lifting for strength is to lift more weight as the weeks go by. This doesn't matter in bodybuilding, where the goal is to challenge the muscles to near-failure in order to stimulate growth. If you aren't increasing the weight, you aren't training for strength. Lifting a slightly heavier dumbbell in each successive workout is a common method, as is adding five or so pounds to a barbell, though of course you can't add weight indefinitely. Adding weight to dips is possible as well. 

If you're doing 4x8, I think doing 4x10 would be a better increase in volume than 5x8. Being able to do another set isn't going to stimulate growth. Lifting the same weight for more reps will be harder and stimulate at least some improvement in strength-endurance. Better than both of those options would be to increase the weight and decrease the volume. Add five pounds and shoot for four sets of 5. If that works, then in the next workout add another five pounds, or do the same (increased) weight 4x8. The process can be repeated for quite a while. 

What is minimal? We can minimize equipment, we can minimize time, but to determine the minimal exercises we need to know more about who is asking the question. Someone who is morbidly obese with emphysema would have a minimum workout of "walk to the end of the driveway every day". An Olympic athlete might have ten workouts a week just to keep from regressing. My point: fitness is relative to a specific task for a specific person, so minimal needs vary widely. So, here are some variations on the theme of minimalism. The Luddite Workout When we talk about minimal exercise programming, the first thing to go is all the equipment. It may not be optimal to eschew dumbbells, barbells, squat racks, bumper plates, kettlebells, benches, rings, pull-up bars and everything else, but it's certainly possible. Most dedicated people can get quite fit and strong with nothing but their own body. So out the window the equipment goes, if we're looking for "minimal". We assume only the use of your own body and the world around you. So what are the most productive exercises to do with just one's nude body and gravity? Well, I wouldn't omit running and sprinting, push-up progressions (from on-the-knees negatives all the way to explosive triple-clapping push-ups and one-armed push-ups), pull-ups and chin-ups if you can find a tree branch or convenient ledge, handstands and flips and other gymnastics, squat progressions (from holding onto a pole to do a third-world squat all the way to jumping single-leg squats for height and distance) and dips if you see fit to allow a pair of sturdy chairs into your arsenal. Of that list, I would say that there is no "must-have" exercise. If you want to do all upper-body strength work and leave out all the running and squatting, that could work. If you want to just run, that will work too. But optimally I would do at least the following: 

This is a question that has been addressed by many governing bodies. The NCAA policy (page 13) is that MTF transgender athletes can compete after a year of living with their new, lowered-testosterone hormonal profile: 

Two minutes is fine. More rest means you'll improve your muscular endurance and recovery time less, however your strength will improve more. People training for strength should take 3 to 5 minute breaks, or even more in some circumstances. People training for fitness, hypertrophy, or endurance might want to work shorter rests--2 minutes, 1 minute, or even circuit training, where one does another exercise (e.g. jump rope or air squats) instead of resting. 

Getting out of bed is a muscle-building exercise for someone recovering from a coma. Tabatas and other High Intensity Interval Training, or jogging, or walking, or anything can build muscle, if the person doing it is unadapted to the activity. So yes, "cardio" exercise is an effective muscle builder, for a limited amount of time, in some circumstances. 1. The Novice Effect 

I'm no expert, but if I were stuck with dumbbells as my only strength and power training equipment, the following exercises would be my first choices: 

Trim your blisters with a nail clipper. There is no quick fix to this being difficult: either wait for the blister to heal or deal with the pain. Buy a brick of chalk. (It should be a buck or two for something the size of your fist.) Chalk your hands, particularly your fingers and the spots that blister. Chalk keeps your hand dry and prevents folds in your grip, both of which cause blisters. I don't see the point of gym gloves. Chalk works. 

Carry your groceries home on foot, holding them in your arms or at your sides with your hands. Garden. Do home repairs and yardwork yourself. Honestly the entire endeavor of trying to work out without working out is, in my opinion, doomed. You can lead a more active lifestyle without explicitly working out. But as soon as you want any sort of specific results--like, say, working your upper body--I don't see the point of avoiding working out. Just get a pull-up bar and use it. 

For your case, try using 50% of your current bench press and curl weights, but double the reps and superset them for several rounds. Rest a few minutes and do something similar with a circuit of bodyweight exercises, organized so that you rest one muscle group while using another. Personally, though, I'd stick to separate cardio and strength workouts, or do an unweighted strengthy-cardio circuit after my pure-strength workout, or use kettlebells for strengthy cardio. These are more effective approaches and safer to boot. For instance: 

Soreness is not an indicator of effectiveness. Bands do not provide the most strenuous resistance. A more efficient exercise to work the upper back would involve pulling and bracing exercises using dumbbells, a barbell, or a pull-up bar, or something that can be jury-rigged into a pull-up bar. For instance, rows, pull-ups, or deadlifts. Proper shoulder retraction and depression during certain yoga poses (e.g. down dog, or its more vigorous relative, the Hindu push-up) could assist as well, but I find best return on time/effort investment from heavier exercises. 

Working out using a baby isn't going to get you very strong or in condition or flexible. Human babies don't grow fast enough to be a challenging resistance tool. Also they aren't equipped with good handles. It's a bummer! I vote for age-appropriate pre-walking/crawling activities, wrestling, and ball games instead. Also, go running with the kid in a jogging stroller. Take long walks with the kid attached, then while they're napping do some kettlebell swings or back squats in the home gym you bought for yourself. 

Not necessarily. More time between workouts could mean that your wrists fully recover and are ready for the increased volume. 

The Benefits of Increasing Cumulative Work As Jonathon Sullivan notes in his discussion of the work of McBride, Haines, and Kirby in The Year in Strength Science 2011, warm-up sets may (or may not) contribute to development of maximum power: 

A front squat should not tire your arms. The bar is supported by your shoulders, with the fingertips merely holding it in place--there is no need to grip the bar. Without a squat rack, you'll need to power clean the barbell into position, which will take some practice. Also, keep in mind that squats are not just a leg exercise. In fact they're not a leg exercise, period. They work the legs, hips, and back to almost equal degrees, and for most people the legs are not the first part to fail. The squat is useful far beyond merely stressing the leg muscles. 

I don't see much use in doing drills specifically for this problem. I'd just focus on dead-hang pull-ups. You'll get stronger with those. The issue here is a mismatch between your perceived strength performance ("I can do 15 chinups") and your "decreased" performance under the standards of the exercise. If you really think you'd benefit from fixing this specific issue with targeted work, I'd do a modified form of Frenchies (a pattern of doing pull-ups with pauses). If 0 were the bottom and 100 is the top, maybe I'd do something like: 

Yes Strictly speaking, anything other than walking, light stretching, resting, lifting heavy weights, and eating is cutting into your strength and muscle gains. Those attributes are built with specific stimulus and recovery. Cardio is not part of that specific stimulus or recovery and therefore is an interloper. But that's only the case if your single goal is pure strength and muscle, which is a fairly narrow goal. No Greg Nuckols asserts that cardio won’t hugely impact your gains in the short run, and may be beneficial for strength and size in the long run 

If you are underweight, for which you and your doctor are the only people who can judge, you need to lift heavy and eat big: 1. Stimulate Growth Either buy a barbell and a power rack, or join a gym that has one. Get a copy of Starting Strength and start lifting heavy. Compound exercises stimulate growth. Squats, chin-ups, deadlifts and presses will tell your body that it needs to get bigger. 2. Provide Fuel for Growth Eat a ton of food. Real food is far superior to processed crap, but you'll need to eat a lot. Your best bets are high-animal-protein items like meat, eggs, milk, and fish. You'll also do well to take in a large amount of vegetables and good fats like coconut and olive oil, and avocado. Eating a lot of food will provide the raw materials your body needs to make you bigger. If someone else cooks for you, you have a choice: 1) man up and learn to cook, 2) try to convince that person to change their cooking for you, or 3) remain undersized. 

If you currently have a one-set max of 12 good-form full-range-of-motion pull-ups, then doing three sets of four isn't going to do much to move that max count. Nor will even a large number of sets of 3 throughout the day. You need to do high-rep sets to improve your high-rep set performance. In my experience, once I am doing a dozen pull-ups, greasing the groove isn't useful as my sole approach. To improve past 8 or so reps I need to do sets of more than 8. (Below 6 or 8, I've found greasing the groove quite useful on its own.) The primary way I'll do this is with 3 sets of my max (say, 15 then 13 then 12) plus some optional couple back-off sets of 5 to 8 or maybe a version of greasing the groove with a handful of 5- or 10-rep sets on days I'm otherwise resting. 3x4 seems like a step backwards. If your 12-rep-max isn't current, or finishes with three kipping reps, or finishes with two reps with bad form, or doesn't involve a full range of motion, then I'd use greasing the groove or lower-rep sets to work on those aspects of my pull-ups first. Make sure you warm up and stretch out your shoulders properly in the morning before your first set of greasing the groove. 

Ways to Separate Similar Exercises With your split, I see problems with the Pendlay rows and the pull-ups being together, as well as the two presses I mentioned before. Since you have chin-ups, pull-ups and Pendlay rows, I'd say you need to either lose one of the exercises, add a C workout, or alternate within the A or B workout, like this: A: chin-ups/pull-ups B: Pendlay rows If you start overworking a movement type, doing volume work instead of heavy regular sets can also be helpful. For instance, many intermediate weekly templates recommend a 70% or 80% squat day in the middle of two heavy squat days. This allows you to still work the movement and drive adaptation without hosing your recovery. My Plan I'd also split the two biggest exercises, the squats and deadlifts. I would organize your exercises like so, using standard nomenclature that leaves out any warm-up sets (which could be more than 2): Workout A 

The goal of light days is not recovery. They may sometimes be light enough to allow some limited recovery from the previous workout, or they may not. The goal is to lift and gain the benefits of lifting without triggering the drawbacks associated with working close to one's maximum volume or intensity. Volume days are taxing because they require a great deal of muscle and soft tissue recovery. One needs substantial food and rest after such a workout. That's the trade-off for the strength and muscle growth that high volume triggers. High-intensity days are taxing to the central nervous system and come with increased risk of injury. One often needs multiple days off after efforts close to 1RM. That's the trade-off for the perspective and strength gain that high intensity work brings. Light days are still lifting days, in that they provide a degree of volume (and thus muscle growth), form practice (and thus improved motor patterns), while avoiding the pitfalls of high-volume or high-intensity work. Just because one isn't operating above 80 or 90% of one's volume or intensity maximum doesn't mean that the workout is unproductive.
