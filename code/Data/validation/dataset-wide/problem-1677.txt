Dana Krempels (Ph.D) appears on the University of Miami Biology Department site as a Senior Lecturer and Director of Undergraduate Studies. Also, several sources online cite her as an expert on rabbits wheekwheekthump.com, allexperts.com. Also, this phenomena is well documented to happen in other places, even before the Fukushima accident: A Metro article from 2008 about an earless bunny from the UK An ABC news article about a German earless baby bunny crashed to death by a TV cameraman. A blog post telling (and showing) about someone's earless bunny. 

Yes it does. The source that you provided does a very good job in citing its credible sources and should suffice alone. But it touches only California, and it's not the only source out there and there are many others (although some cite the same sources). There are news reports about the high costs of execution in different US states: In Illinois (In an article about Iowa): 

Also citing the Lanham Act as having provisions that provide remedy for customers against corporations that have deceived them. McDonald's have admitted that they used Pink Slime in their products and have announced that they will stop using it. (source: ABC news). Pink Slime can constitute up to 15 percent of ground beef without additional labeling in the USA (source: ABC news): 

Yes, some monkeys do peel bananas from the floral end, if they get access to them, but not all the time. While Sklivvz's answer is correct about the lack of access of monkeys to bananas in the wild, monkeys who live next to humans have access to bananas, and, at least some of them, do peel the banana from the floral side. Here are some videos depicting monkeys peeling a banana from the floral side. Please take note, however, that the monkeys don't do it as "neatly" as it's depicted in the video by the human, and use their teeth to help them peel the banana. 

Cigarette packs in various countries contain warnings on them, some of them contain only text, some contain text and pictures that suppose to ditter the user, and the most extreme are Australian packs that not only contain text warning and pictures, but also removed all branding from the packets. Have any of those methods was proven to reduce smoking? Some examples (I've blurred the brands from the pictures) Just textual warning: 

You already have a reputable source for the claim in the CNN article that you provided. This claim has been repeated by different sources as well: 

No, the pack is led by the alpha (breeding) females. The picture is taken from the BBC 2011 documentary Frozen Planet. This Guardian article which features pictures from the documentary describes the picture as: 

Yes he did. In a (NSFW)speech that he delivered at the 2013 American Renaissance conference, he said: 

However, in addition to the cases depicted in @non-Saudi man and @user1873 answers, the King Khalid Foundation started a national campaign in Saudi Arabia aimed at stopping domestic abuse. Here are sources describing the campaign: 

The USSR had a better military than Germany in WWII, the proof for this is the second part of the book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, in other words, the Nazis lost and the USSR won, in a conflict that was mostly decided by Armor clashes, like the Battle of Kursk. Tanks are made to win battles and wars and the T-34 was successful while the German Tiger and the Panzer IV weren't. However to choose which tank is better would need a definition of quality, or "what do you mean by better". To do a comparison to anther losing German vehicle, the Maybach brand, while having more luxurious and better engineered cars than Toyota, it was closed, while Toyota is the 12th-largest company in the world by revenue. Maybach, while having better engineered and more comfortable cars, had a price tag that was so high that (almost) nobody wanted to buy them, at the same time Toyota cars are selling like condoms in a cheap Motel. The same happened with the German Tanks, While being superior engineer-wise they weren't easy to manufacture, and not suitable for war time economics. The USSR produced 35119 T-34 tanks and 29430 T-34-85 tanks in the period between 1941-1945, it's a total of 64549 T-34 Tanks produced in 5 years, while the Germans managed to produce only 1347 Tiger I tanks and approxematly 8800 Panzer IV tanks which is a total 10147 tanks in a period longer than what the Russian had. So the soviets had the sheer number advantage, on the Battle of Kursk The Soviets had 2.7 times more tanks than the German and on the Battle of Moscow the Soviets had 1.9 times more tanks. The Military Channel did a "Top 10 Tanks" article, that named the T-34 as the best tank ever, while the Tiger and Panzer IV got the 3rd and 6th places respectivly, the reasons are the same as I explaned. You can watch these video clips where they explain in more detail that while the German Tanks were exactly what you would expect from german engeneering, their cost and manufacturing time were just too high to fight in an all out war that lasted for 5 years. The T-34: $URL$ The Tiger: $URL$ The Panzer IV: $URL$ There is no "Best tank", there is the more suitable tank and army. While the Panzer and the German war machine were probably the more suitable Army for short engagements in relatively small areas like Poland, France, the Netherlands and Belgium, The T-34, the Red Army and the Russian People were more suitable for an attrition war in the largest country in the world during one of the harshest winters of that decade. 

But they don't give a source for the number. vocativ.com also have an article about the ritual, with pictures documenting it, and acording to them: 

At the end of their show (Penn & Teller Bullshit, s.07 ep.03) on violent video games, Penn & Teller claim (at the 26:10 mark): 

Husseini didn't tell Hitler to exterminate the Jews, and the issue wasn't discussed at all in their meeting. The full record of the conversation is available in Documents on German Foreign Policy 1918-1945, Series D, Vol XIII, the record of their conversation appears on pages 881-885. A second source containing the full book, just in case. An article in The Times of Israel with only the transcript of the conversation. While both mention the Jews as the natural enemies of both the German and the Arab people, they don't talk about the solution to "The Jewish Problem", nor does the Mufti offer any advice on how to handle the Jews. Hitler does say that: 

On the first sentence they say "To create "static" charge, we transfer the electrons" but then they say "created by removing electrons from a neutral atom", which is the same as transferring an electron. You will get static charge if you just "remove" the electron, but the electron has to go somewhere. 

However, in hotels the phenomenon is less frequent, as shows this Article by Yahoo Travel, that lists the top 10 stolen items from Novotel hotels. The bible is not among them: 

Other recipients of the Dickin Medal include: Beach Comber, Broad Arrow, Commando, William of Orange and others Also, according to the Wikipedia post on Pigeon post: 

LV doesn't sell its products with discounts, and destroying unsold products is a common practice with both high-end and less expensive brands to avoid counterfeiting and increase the exclusivity of the brand. So it's a safe assumption that LV are destroying their unsold products. Not necessarily by fire, but still destroying them instead of putting them on sale. 

It appears on the source, but there is no option to copy-paste it and I'm too lazy to transcibe it at the moment, so here is a screen capture: 

Yes they can, as long as they are not eaten, or killed in other ways. Here is an article at National Geographic:
