So much for how the orbits work. Now how about eclipses? For a solar or lunar eclipse here on earth, you need the sun, the earth and the moon to all lie on a straight line. The special cases you describe sound like the case of 4 objects on a straight line. As far as I can see, an observer on the ground would only observe "ordinary" lunar and solar eclipses. The only special thing would be that after observing say, a solar eclipse, the observer could later read in the news that a lunar eclipse had taken place simultaneously on the other side of his planet. 

Plato's story of Atlantis invokes all four. It existed 9000 years before Plato, it was located somewhere in the uncharted atlantic, on a single island, that sank into the ocean. To answer your question, the choice of time period in your own story will then depend both on how exotic the forgotten civilization is and to what degree you invoke techniques two, three and four. The updates to the Atlantis myth also reflects this, by locating it in more and more remote locations [3]. In 1623, only some fifteen years after the Jamestown Colony was founded but with Atlantic crossings to south and central american colonies already routine, Francis Bacon chose to place Atlantis off the west coast of North America. In 1934, when most of the world was well chartered, the italian Julius Evola placed Atlantis on the North Pole [2]. The pole had first been visited only 8 years earlier, by Roald Amundsen in an airship. In the 60's and 70's, when exploration of the sea-floor was well established, Erich Von DÃ¤niken and others proposed that Atlantis was instead beneath the ice sheet of Antarctica [1]. [1] $URL$ [2] The american William Fairfield Warren had also proposed the North Pole Atlantis in 1885. [3] A notable exception is Professor Olaus Rudbeck at Uppsala University, Sweden, who in 1679 proposed that Atlantis was in fact Sweden and that the capital of Atlantis was his own Uppsala. For this he was widely ridiculed. 

Not All 4 Need to be Blades A body morphology like the one used for one of the invasive alien species in the half life spin-off Opposing Force would work. 

For a power source utilize a simple wet-cell voltaic pile, a primitive sort of battery. Its just zinc, copper, and salt water soaked felt disks piled up in alternating order. It would produce enough electricity to power a primitive spark-gap transmitter. 

In addition to crazy efficient (possibly physically impossible) compact and lightweight power storage you need some seriously heavy duty power management as well. If you try to conduct too much electricity through too narrow of a circuit its going to increase electrical resistance. This means heat. A LOT of heat. If you pulse a large enough amount of electricity through too narrow of a circuit (aka narrow enough to fit inside a handheld device) its just going to explode. You need extremeley powerful room temperature superconductors, which also might be something that is impossible to exist. Metallic hydrogen might be one but we dont know how stable/unstable it is yet, its theorized that its pretty stable, but if components of a weapon were made out of it every soldier would be carrying an unpredictable bomb instead of a reliable weapon. Were talking about exposing something that can explosivley revert back to a gaseous state to a lot of heat and kinetic energy. 

A Peculiar Sort of Cape The character wears a sort of rigger's harness under his clothing with a large billowing cape-like garment attached to it. Instead of fabric the cape is thousands of sturdy threads. While thread seems weak, if enough of them are spreading out his body weight over a large enough area no single thread would need to be bearing much more than a few ounces of weight. It would also look mad-creepy. If his abilities are focused and fine-tuned enough (its magic so he can be as in control as you want him to be) he could even have them arrayed behind him in such way that they look like a massive blurred and droning set of flies wings. 

In 1984, Professor Alexander Demandt published a survey of the reasons historians have given for the fall of Rome. [1,2] The list numbers 210 reasons, ranging from lead and mercury poisoning to public baths and polytheism. Rome's alleged killers are as varied a barbarians, bureaucrates, feminists, hedonists and militarists. Personally I lean toward the systems thinking school, which states that it's a fallacy to assume that large effects have large causes. The monumental event that was JFK's assasination could have been the act of a lone loser, it does not need to be a conspiracy of proportional size. Similarly, if we could trace the cause of the fall of Rome, there may have been one or a multitude of events too insignificant to remember, that could yet have turned events on their head. Maybe a chance meeting between an influential backer and a now forgotten senator, that could have become an oustanding emperor? Maybe some years of slightly worse harvests in Germany would prevent it amassing the barbarian army in the Teutoburg forest? Perhaps some minor innovation in early Rome, which gets multiplied as its culture spreads over the centuries, to make the provinces more profitable or robust to changes in climate. That Rome lays in the distant past does not excuse the many fanciful explanations. Everyone reading this answer were alive during the 2008 financial crisis. We were there as it happened, but the theories as to why it happened keeps increasing. It has been explained through a commodities boom, a peak-oil scenario, the theory of scale-free networks, reactionary gender roles, weakened legislation, an error in a mathematical formula, the dot-com bubble, the postwar baby boom and a number of arguments for why "the system" is set to produce regular booms and busts without outside intervention. I can count about 40 reasons in wikipedia articles alone. Within our lifetime, the number of explanations for the financial crisis may well rival that of the fall of Rome. As for story-writing, I would love to see someone write a story from the systems thinking perspective. Maybe the protagonist does one little thing, which through unforeseen consequences escalates until he's watching helplessly, as his civilization crumbles around him. It's a tantalizing idea, that the seed of a glorious future or the end of civilization as we know it could be buried in the small and mundane around us. Or perhaps the real literary wonder is not found in explaining the fall of empires, but in how they sustain themselves for centuries. Unlikely islands of orderliness in a sea of chaos.

I was a Marine Infantryman and I think people have zero idea how truly powerful modern weaponry is. In movies fighter jets float lazily in at a monster firing point blank until he swats it down like a bird. In reality those jets are going to be at 30,000 feet moving at twice the speed of sound carrying enough ordinance to level several city blocks which they can target and fire from several miles away. For example, the TOW 2 bravo Aero missile (my weapon specialization). It was a 68 pound guided missile with a range of 4,500 meters (just under 3 miles.) The missile covers that maximum distance in 26 seconds. Thats a 68 pound guided missile with a shaped charge that can penetrate meters of concrete or several inches of hardened homogenous steel moving faster than a lot of handgun bullets. The TOW is considered a small and somewhat slow missile, and is also somewhat obsolete since it needs to be manually steered and nwer stuff like the javelin are fire and forget. So yeah. A single Marine could mess up yer dragon good from several miles away and not even have to get out of his gun turret seat. 

I Have Lived and Fought Alongside Uzbeks I am a former Marine Infantryman and I have fought alongside the Uzbeks, albeit the ones in the northern alliance of Afghanistan where they are an ethnic minority. Uzbeks are....... odd. They live in a strange mixture of modernity and ancient custom. For instance you will find a man with an AK-47 and modern uniform who still believes that he and his brethren's military success is due to angels and good spirits, and has no qualms about riding a horse to get around or even in the attack. They tend to be very tenacious in the defense and highly skilled at ambushes, but once they have lost the initiative and element of surprise while on the attack they are a lot more likely to scatter and try the assault again later than stick it out and try to see it through. They also have this very frustrating habit of using the mantra "In'sh Allah." You could write a book detailing the various intricacies of what this means, but simply put it means "if God wills it." Need them to be on time and in position? "In'sh Allah" in other words "well, maybe we'll get to it, maybe we wont. God will decide." The western idea of "we will do everything possible in our power to get in position and be on time or die trying" just doesn't happen very often. I say all of this because frankly, the Uzbeks simply couldn't conquer eastern Asia. Pakistan and Iran have far more professional and modern military mindsets than they do. The Uzbeks are mostly tribal and chiefdom oriented which is great for defending against incursions by pashto tribesmen and such (like they did against the Taliban back in 2001) but its really not great for offensive operations. The best they can really do is chase a harried enemy they defeated from the defensive a ways out of their territory. The last time the Taliban began moving in on the Uzbeks only american green berets and US lead airstrikes were able to chase the Taliban out of northern Afghanistan, and it was so close to becoming a defeat that at one point the Northern Alliance was literally one machine-gun crew failing to hold it's position away from utter defeat. The Pashto Afghan to the south vastly outnumber them, the Pakistani and Iranian military would simply steamroll them.If they invaded Kazakhstan russia would flip its REDACTED and rip them apart, if they head east china would do the same. The only way we could expect to see Uzbeks invading their neighbors was if the USA or some other world power were using them as fodder kind of like we did with the Iraqi Army against ISIS or Russia using the Syrian military as cat's paws. Uzbeks just aren't very good at taking the initiative. If say, china wanted to use them to push into the middle east, or if Russia wanted to use them as proxies to push their influence south, or if the USA wanted to antagonize Russia or china by establishing a powerful allied power on one or both of these countries doorsteps it could happen. The important thing to remember is that the more powerful nation using them would be what was actually providing the heavy hitting power and deterrent from counter attack. Uzbeks really don't want to fight anyone, they were only barely able to rally resistance to the Taliban, and the Taliban Pashto had to get pretty well into a genocidal campaign to provoke that response. Uzbeks are by nature pretty accepting and laid back people, their women run around with uncovered faces and they allow Jews and Christians to live unmolested, if its not a direct threat to their existence they just really don't care much. The taliban were less a religious movement and more an ethnic cleansing dressed up in religious rhetoric, the Taliban were really just the Pastho tribes trying to assimilate or eradicate any of the ethnic minorities within Afghanistan, the uzbeks even tolerated them to a remarkable degree until they started killing everyone's wives and children. Final word I would have to say on Uzbeks from living among them is that to get them to fight you need to threaten their existence, and even then they need a ton of help from a more powerful nation. Angels and lucky spirits are fine and well, but it was really our airstrikes and our boots on the ground advising and assisting that carried the day. 

A cellphone from our era transmits with a power between 0.6 and 3 watts. For comparision, the Voyager probes had a 12 watt antenna. To succeed, the Voyager had to aim its dish at Earth and large radio telescopes on Earth were needed to receive the feeble signal. If the transponder's dish isn't broken and can be pointed to likely craft locations, a cellphone may therefore produce enough power for a signal, even if it's gibberish. A cellphone will usually max out its transmissions power when searching for a base station. Aiming at a large radio telescope somewhere would be better than broadcasting aimlessly. If you can transmit to Earth when your pod passes directly between say, Earth and Mars with it colonies, a lot of radio telescopes on Earth would already be aimed your way. 

How about alternative methods? A standard water tower is about 40 metres high. To get the same potential energy in the water you'd need: 

TL;DR: Don't worry, your ship can handle this. Where are the dangers: Sunspots, solar flares and coronal mass ejections all occur most frequently around the equator of the sun. It would therefore be preferable to park a ship near the poles. In practice, one would use a polar orbit which only visits the equator for short periods of time. But what is the potential damage? 

The Raccoons Originally a North-American species, it has dexterious hands and thumbs, can stand upright not unlike a meerkat, is an omnivore, good at problem solving and has a complex social life. These are all traits that have been proposed as crucial for the development of Homo Sapiens. Without human existence, present-day North America is full of large herbivores, with descendants of mammoths traversing the arctic from Scandinavia through Siberia and Canada. The Raccoons spread north and live on a mixture of scavenging on large prey and hunting down smaller or weaker prey in packs. Without human interference, the next glacial period arrives when it should and allow the Racoons to cross the Bering Strait. From there they spread rapidly throughout Asia and Europe. In Europe they become a terrible invasive species, decimating birds, amphibians and other mammals just as they have done to a lesser extent in real-world Europe today. A line of Racoons radiate out on open grass-land, either in central Eurasia or Africa and develop a truly upright posture, to better survey the land for prey and predators. This frees up their already dexterious hands and sets off a feedback-cycle between tool-use, more dexterious hands, brain development and hunting techniques. One sunny day, a million years from now, a young inquisitive racoon is left back in camp while her family hunts. Out of curiosity or boredom, she grabs a piece of flint and slams it against a rock laying in the dry grass...
