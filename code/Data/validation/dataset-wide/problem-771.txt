The Moon indeed "wobbles" about in its orbit because it goes around the Earth in an ellipse and not a circle. From our point of view, it wobbles a little back and forth such that over a lunar cycle, we end up seeing about 59% of its surface. The effect is referred to as lunar libration. You can find a number of videos that show how the Moon looks to us over the course of a cycle. 

You don't have a perpetual motion machine because you are losing energy to space in the form of heat, light, solar wind, etc. Even if you want to restrict it to the case where you are not expelling gas, you are always going to lose energy to heat radiation. The Sun loses mass all the time. It will keep doing this until it cannot generate enough internal heat to counterbalance its tendency to contract due to gravity. There is a whole progression where it burns its hydrogen, then its helium, etc. Finally, when it runs out of stuff to burn, it collapses and "blows up" in a nova or supernova, or it could just fizzle out. Its fate depends upon its mass. 

The dominant effect could be different other places. For instance, the moons of Jupiter have to deal with the dynamo generated from the Jovian magnetic field. And in a case like Io, the atmospheric stripping doesn't happen as quickly as expected because apparently every time Io goes behind Jupiter and loses sunlight, its atmosphere condenses out and falls to the surface! 

For your second question, it depends upon whether you are talking about composition by number, or composition by mass (the numbers you give are roughly the composition by mass). If you want to get really specific, you can add in the other elements too. To answer the first, you add them up proportionally. 

We don't have any measurements near 1 AU that are at high latitudes. Some spacecraft have done out of ecliptic polar orbits with high apogees, but the heliocentric latitudes were still within ~$10^{\circ}$ of the ecliptic plane. The notes above discuss our only real measurements out of the ecliptic by the Ulysses spacecraft. 

There is no net internal magnetic field to perturb, so how could one induce currents? The effect arises on Earth because some transient event (e.g., coronal mass ejection or CME) hits Earth's magnetosphere and causes a sudden $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ which, from Faraday's law, results in induced electric fields. These induced electric fields then drive currents in things like power grids (typically long-distance wires running east-west at high latitudes), oil pipelines, etc. The only changing magnetic field would be that of the solar wind and the small, localized magnetic anomalies on the surface of Mars. However, these fields are incredibly small so the $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ would be even smaller. 

Not necessarily. We can artificially induce VLF emissions using ground-based transmitters. But otherwise yes, there needs to be free energy for the radiation of electromagnetic waves. 

Velocity The solar wind speed has a large range of variation, between ~250–820 km/s [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009] near the ecliptic plane. These values are not including interplanetary shocks, which can have speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. The speed is generally higher at higher latitudes out of the ecliptic plane, tending to be over 650 km/s [e.g., McComas et al., 2008; 2013]. Number Density The number density also has a large range of values, from ~2–90 $cm^{-3}$ [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009]. Again, these do not include interplanetary shocks or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Charge State The alpha particle to proton number density ratio varies between ~1-5%, depending on solar cycle and solar wind speed [e.g., Kasper et al., 2012; Schwadron et al., 2014]. We have also measured the ratio of $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ and $C^{6+}/C^{5+}$, finding ~1-30% and ~20-200%, respectively [e.g., Schwadron et al., 2014]. 

One thing to keep in mind is that the Kepler instrument is not a telescope like Hubble. It is a photometer and though it uses CCDs to look at the sky, it doesn't return a picture in the usual sense. The way it operates is that you only look at the pixels around the object you're interested in because otherwise you'd never get all those pixels transmitted to the ground because there are so many of them. To observe the comet, they looked at the track it would make across the Kepler field of view. They chose only the pixels you'd need to look at the comet and its tail, and this turned out to be a 15-pixel-wide swath across the detector. That band across the image you see is that swath. You'll notice that most of the picture is black, which are all the pixels that they didn't look at. The stars in the scene where the image isn't back are the stars that Kepler was also looking at. However, I'm not intimately familiar with raw Kepler data so I can't tell you why the stars are in clusters of four. Because all the stars are lined up in the same direction, I would surmise that this is because Kepler was tracking the comet and the stars were moving in the background. From the way they were going to take the measurements, each 36 hour observation was made up of three observations, so I am at a loss as to why there are four dots per star when this would suggest there would be three. The answer to the science question can be found from the observation proposal. To summarize: 

At least in the case of Mars, the solar wind carries a magnetic field by the planet. In the Martian atmosphere are ionized particles created from interactions with UV light, cosmic rays, etc. The moving magnetic field creates an electric field that accelerates the ions away from the planet. This effect was very recently measured by the MAVEN spacecraft: 

In space plasmas, ELF is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 Hz to ~3 kHz. Very low frequency (VLF) is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 kHz to ~30 kHz. Generally the cutoff frequency of the Earth's ionosphere prevents waves at such low frequencies from freely passing through it. In plasmas, this tends to be any wave at or below the local electron plasma frequency, which can be approximated as $f_{pe} \approx 8.9787 \ \sqrt{n_{e} \left[ cm^{-3} \right]}$ kHz (where the $\left[ cm^{-3} \right]$ implies that the electron number density, $n_{e}$, should be in units of $cm^{-3}$). The densities in the ionosphere are ~$10^{3} - 10^{6} \ cm^{-3}$, which corresponds to $f_{pe}$ ~ 280 kHz to ~9 MHz. Early studies found a relationship between lightning and a VLF emissions called whistlers. It is now known that high energy electron beams, associated with the lightning, escape into the magnetosphere. These beams radiate the whistlers through a plasma instability (i.e., free energy due to a fast beam streaming through an otherwise homogeneous plasma). So the free energy sources can escape the lower atmosphere, but the electromagnetic emissions at such low frequencies cannot. 

Generally, waves with $f < f_{pe}$ experience damping as they propagate through a plasma. This is because the wave fields oscillate slow enough to interact with the particles, thus adding an effective inertia term to the system. ELF and VLF waves generally damp through cyclotron and Landau resonances. Note, however, that both of these resonances are also the processes responsible for wave growth in the presence of sufficient free energy (e.g., free energy from beams is often related to a Landau-like or Cerenkov-like emission). 

The properties of the terrestrial magnetosphere vary so widely, you would need to narrow down this question. For instance, the charge states are completely different (e.g., we observe $O^{1+}$ but not $O^{7+}$) but the number densities range from ~$10^{-2}-10^{3} \ cm^{-3}$.
