and someone commented that my power readings were a bit "optimistic" I asked why and he basically thought that if I'm getting 600W I should be doing a lot more than 30 MPH. He says he can cruise at 30 MPH at only 250W! In the end he seemed satisfied that the difference is that he weighs 74KG, I am a bit over 100KG. On another video someone commented that he would fly on a carbon bike with a nice groupset. It seems to me that weight of bike / rider and groupset is going to make very little difference cruising on a flat with no gear shifts. Am I suddenly going to end up cruising at 40MPH at 600W when I loose 10KG? 

I am looking for something similar to a saddle bag but that mounts to the seat post and not the saddle. I have a rear mounted camera that attaches to the saddle so want a bag that I can mount lower down on the seat post. I want to keep tubes, CO2, multitool etcetera in there. I have searched and can't find anything. Thanks 

I have used Speedplay pedals for ages and I think I am on my third set of pedals. I have the new aero walkable cleats and at the weekend I replaced my old knackered cleats with a new set. Now that I am on the new set of cleats my left leg (the one I un-click at lights) is popping out of the pedal. It also doesn't feel right and is not a very solid click feeling when I click in and out. When pedalling it occasionally feels like it half pops out. My foot then feels like it is at an angle. After this happens I can fairly easily just pull my foot off the pedal without twisting. On my old cleats I had similar issues but I assumed it was because the cleats were knackered. I have only had these pedals since January last year so I've only done about 6000 miles on them. I have not had to replace the bearings or anything in there. This is 6,000 miles of commuting through London so many stops at lights. I am going to buy a new set of pedals but I Was wondering if I have any options for fixing my existing set as a spare. I have looked but can't seem to find any replacement pedal bodies for Zero pedals. Is there anywhere I can post the pedals to that will service them? I am in the UK. 

Jockey wheels seem like the most pointless thing to upgrade on a bike. I can see swapping out the usual grey ceramic jockey wheels for an anodized alloy one to match the look of the rest of the bike, but I can't see any possible performance related reason to do so. Do they aid in shifting quality at all? I know that dura-ace and ultegra derailleurs use jockey wheels with bearings instead of bushings to improve durability, but they still use ceramics. Is there any benefit of using the alloy jockey wheels? 

I recently purchased a Fuji Track Classic bicycle. It's meant to be my commuter bike. I was resigned to using a clip-on fender, but when I looked more closely it appeared that there should be room to mount full fenders on the frame. There's lots of clearance. The front for even has mounting points for a fender. Is there any guideline for clearance that I should be conscious of? Does it look like it will work? 

I was overhauling a coaster hub the other day. The snapring was recessesed and no screwdriver in my arsenal was small enough to remove the piece. Park recommends using a small screwdriver to remove the ring: 

Sheldon Brown had a vintage bike pricing guide. It may be somewhat out of date because he died a few years ago. 

No combination lock provides a high enough level of protection to warrant being tested as a valid means of security. Speaking from experience, I have never seen one that a decent pair of bolt cutters couldn't get through in less than 15 seconds. I'm not a bike thief. I volunteer at a bike co-op that takes donated bikes and refurbishes them for sale; these often have old locks on the frame for which the combination has been forgotten. You'll find some lock comparisons online where they test the security of different locks against one another. However, these generally focus on mid to high-range locks, which always have keys. There isn't much point testing out the low-end combo locks. However, since you've said that price and weight aren't an issue, but that a combination and security are the most important features, I recommend you keep your bike in a large safe. 

I am hoping to buy one of these in the next few weeks: Specialized Roubaix SL4 Expert Disc Di2 2014 Road Bike But I will be using it for commuting and need some luggage so I need to fit a pannier rack (I'm going to ignore all the shouts of horror about using this bike for commuting or putting a rack on it). Initially I thought that this was not possible and I was looking at getting a custom Titanium frame made with the same components. I have now found a couple of options though. There is the Tubus set of pannier racks. I have used a Tubus rack before on a bike with no eyelets and it seemed to work very well. If I use the Tubus Clamp Set For Seat Stay Mounting and the Tubus Adapter Set For QR-Axle Mounting I think that'll work won't it? I am unsure if the rack will clear the disc brakes though... There is also the Axiom set of racks as shown in the video. They specifically make a rack for road bikes with disc brakes which sounds very promising. I can't see how the rack will attach to the frame at the top with no eyelets and no caliper brakes. I could use the Tubus Clamp set though (which I have on my current bike) So, Will mounting this to my bike damage the carbon frame? Any recommendations about which rack / mounting system I should go for? Thanks 

(this isn't a discussion on the attractiveness of large cyclists and likelihood of sexual congress...) In my cycling career I have varied between 22 stone and 15 stone. At 6'2" the leanest I have ever been is still over 20% body fat. I am not sure I've ever bonked... My normal cycling day is an 18 mile ride into work before I have eaten or drunk anything. I have a yogurt granola thing for breakfast and salad for lunch. Some fig rolls mid afternoon then cycle 18 miles home. I have done 80 mile training rides and really not eaten anything much. I do sometimes feel tired and a bit weak but I thought that bonking was worse than that. I assume that as I carry quite large energy reserves around with me that I don't bonk. 

Acera is on the lower end of Shimano's line of components for hybrids and other bikes that aren't going to see an exceptional amount of stress. They fit that bill relatively well, but being built mainly of plastic they do have a tendency to wear out over time. Having said that, it's probably the best deal you're going to get in terms of usefulness and longevity per dollar. 

Go with the hybrid. You can ride a hybrid over some pretty rough terrain. You might also consider a cyclocross bike, which is basically a road bike designed for rough terrain. They're more expensive though. 

Check with the airline you are flying with. Airlines generally have a small surcharge for taking a bike along, since people frequently travel with sporting equipment. I looked into flying with a bike from Canada to France last year and it was only a $30 charge on the airline I was flying with (they even accepted tandems). I can't guarantee your airline will be as reasonable, but it's definitely worth looking into. 

It's easy to calculate what capacity of a rear derailleur will be needed based on the size of the big and small chainring and the big and small cog. What about the converse question, how to calculate the capacity of a derailleur? I was comparing some short-cage rear derailleurs I have lying around, and I noticed that the cage length and pulley sizes varied enough that they probably had different capacities. Related question: is there a fairly comprehensive place to look these up? 

Don't ride that. Aluminum will randomly snap at the best of times, and a fold-looking bend like yours only makes it worse. 

Having spent an inordinate amount of time riding a bike with a sora group, I can attest for its quality. A lot of people on bike forums say you need a 105 or higher to get a decent ride quality. Maybe for them this is true. I've done a lot of riding on tiagra, 105, and ultegra; they're nice, just not necessary for the average rider. I've never had any problems with a sora component in terms of rideability or durability. This isn't to say that the more expensive groups don't ride nicer, or aren't more durable. Having said that, shimano does make a lot of crap. It's generally found in the non-series parts. These have a tendency to break frequently and they don't work all that well in the first place. 

Not unlike other brands, I've heard that older Panaracer Pasela tires ran slim when compared to their advertised width, probably a marketing ploy to get the weight down for its size - but I've also heard and read (on the internets..) that recent production has changed such that the widths are wider, more true to spec. The cool thing about the Paselas is that they come in so many sizes. That's also the bad thing - none of the local bike shops carry them. I'm trying to determine the widest tire I can fit in my bike. Anyone out there with Paselas on your bike, can you report the width of the tire at its widest point, along with the spec'd width? Even better would be someone with the Pasela TG 700c x 28 - the size I'm aiming for - that would more than awesome. 

Ok, I know form sometimes follows function - and things can be even more funnily irrational when fashion and trends come into play - but what's the lure of the cyclist's messenger bag? I see them everywhere, and can't help but imagine them to be a big pain in the lopsided way they hang on a single shoulder, not to mention the strap-over-the-head maneauver required to take one off, becoming even more awkward in tight quarters like say a small cafe. But there they are, ever popular. People who enjoy using them tend to be quite passionate about them - and I doubt it's limited to just the style of the bag. Having little experience riding with backpacks or messenger bags, I ask, why do you choose to ride with one over the other? 

I have a mountain bike tire that has stamped on the side something like: <----------front rear-------------> Which seems like a pretty clear indication that the tire should be oriented in one direction when used in the front, and the opposite when used in the rear. Is that right? This is counter intuitive to me - I would have expected tire tread to face the same direction on both wheels - like cars. If so, is this true in all cases? For example, road bike tires with tread to handle rain? And finally...why?
