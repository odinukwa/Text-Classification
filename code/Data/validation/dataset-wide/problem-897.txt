Pantagruel was written and published first, in 1532, but Gargantua, written and published in 1534, is the first story in internal chronological order. Pierre de Tours made an edition combining both works with Gargantua before Pantagruel in 1542, and most subsequent editions combining the two works put them in the same order. You can expect a lot of variation on the spelling. Not only was French spelling not yet standardized in Rabelais's time, but it was undergoing a lot of changes in which Rabelais participated. Rabelais was a partisan of including etymological information in spelling and devised his own system. (Pléiade, “Notice sur la langue de Rabelais”, II, p. XXXVII–XLIII; Huchon: Rabelais, p. 131-317) He and his printers revised the spelling between editions of some of his work. Additionally, as 16th century French is hard to read for people who lived in the 18th century and later, many later editions have modernized the spelling. Rabelais made many minor revisions to the text of the first two books (Gargantua, Pantagruel), and fewer on the next two (Tiers livre, Quart livre). The *[Cinquième livre]($URL$ Livre) is another story: it was published posthumously and there are debates as to which parts were actually written by Rabelais and thus many different claims to authenticity. In the opening paragraph of chapter I of Pantagruel, the most significant change is the replacement of the mention of Luke and Matthew, biographers of Christ, by “Greeks and pagans”. Rabelais made this change for the 1537 edition by Denis de Harsy (Pléiade, “Pantagruel —— Notes et variantes”, p. 1240). This was one of several changes that removed direct religious references, especially to the New Testament (ib., p. 1232). References (Pléiade) Rabelais — Œuvres complètes, coll.

I dispute your claim that the Turing test, or Turing's article, is about gender. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; I see no hint in Turing's article that the test is about gender. If you think that it is, it is up to you to come up with evidence why that is a reasonable conclusion. Therefore, the only thing that is answerable in your question is: why does Turing use gender, to explain or make a point that is unrelated to gender? I see no evidence that this is anything but the straightforward didactic device it appears to be. Note that Turing uses the word sex, you use the word gender. I'll use the word sex, following Turing; the distinction is actually somewhat relevant, but not philosophically so. In this answer will not distinguish between thinking, consciousness, sentience, soul possession and other similar but not identical concepts. Turing uses the word “thinking” and links it to some variations on these other ideas but does not make a clear distinction between them. I will do likewise, although much could be said on the topic. Also, my perspective is that of a (former) computer scientist and occasional teacher of computer science. I am familiar with the concept of the Turing test and the historical context in which it was formulated but have not researched Turing's writings or the precise context in which he wrote this text. Let us start with the historical context. In Turing's time, the concept of a machine that might think in a way that's similar to a human is rather novel, daring and prima facie rejected. The concept is not wholly new — numerous human creation myths and golem and other similar ideas have existed for longer than we have recorded history. What was new in Turing's time was the idea that the creation of a thinking mind could be understood in technological terms and not just as magic: a thinking mind would be constructed by engineers, who would use techniques that are in principle reproducible (see §3) rather than a magical insufflation of life by dint of opaque biological processes or divine grant. It was a rather shocking idea, which is why about than half of the article consists of a refutation of counterarguments. So we have a philosophically daring idea which needs to be explained in a way that won't outright shock the audience and cause immediate rejection. An abrupt presentation of the idea would risk being emotionally rejected without serious intellectual consideration. This calls for a gradual presentation that first hooks the audience into a reasonable-sounding series of arguments, and then shows that if this idea is reasonable then so should be the more daring one. The daring idea is that a human and a (sufficiently advanced) thinking machine cannot be distinguished through the way they think, and the way they communicate via language in the abstract. (Turing neglects the language aspect, assuming that a thinking machine would be able to master human language. I will likewise consider mastery of language as part of the requirements of thinking.) The human and the machine may be distinguished by physical characteristics — they may have different size and shape, they may have different means of concrete communication (typing vs holding a pen, different timbers of voice, etc.). The point of the setup of the Turing test is to argue that these are only superficial differences that do not matter to the crucial question of whether the machine thinks. So we need to explain that there's a test for which a thinking machine and a human will be indistinguishable. But since this claim would immediately be rejected, we need to bring it up gradually. Then let's start where we have two different humans who need to be distinguished. Nothing shocking about that. Human A is trying to pass off as human B, human B is trying to refute this, and the goal of the interrogator C is to determine which is which. With two specific humans, C would have an easy job, by asking something that only B would know. So the test doesn't really work with specific humans. It would work a lot better with categories of humans. This way, A could justify ignorance of a fact, or variation from a stereotype, because not every member of the category would have to know the fact or follow the stereotype. We need to find a way to distinguish between two categories of humans who are not easily distinguished by their knowledge or mental ability. Yet these categories should be unambiguously distinct. Preferably those categories should have physical distinctions, to make the requirements for the setup of the test more evident. Things like nationality (which would lead to knowledge and language differences) and age (not well-defined and could also have noticeable intrinsic differences) wouldn't work. On the other hand, sex perfectly fits the requirement. Note that this does not require to accept that there is no intrinsic mental difference between men and women. While Turing's society did make some distinctions in this respect, his audience would not automatically have jumped to the conclusion that the test would obviously reveal which is which. And in any case what matters is not that the test could not reveal which is which under any circumstance, but that it is plausible that the interrogator would be unable to decide. Hence, first make the test be about sex. Then, once the audience has accepted the framework of the test as reasonable, switch the test to be about human vs machine. If the test is good enough to determine whether men and women can be distinguished as a category, then it's good enough to determine whether humans and machines can be distinguished as a category. Once the test has been established in section 1, Turing does not come back to the idea of testing for sex (gender). The paper is not about a test for gender. 

An advantage with this classic is that multiple translations are often available for comparison. You have the translation by William Adlington in a modernized spelling. I didn't find another English translation online but I used two French translations (Nisard 1865, Bastien 1787) to write this answer. Fire and iron Cupid is not exactly described as a “fiery winged serpent”: his wings and the fiery aspect are mentioned separately. The fiery aspect is mentioned in the line “flammaque et ferro singula debilitat”: he cripples (debilitat) with fire (flamma) and iron (ferro). The word ferro can mean any of many objects made of iron, most commonly the sword, but here I think it refers to arrow tips. Although today Cupid's best known attribute is his arrows, the Romans also often had him carry a torch, as seen in the (modern) sculpture Cupid and Hymen George Rennie. The symbol of the lit flame standing for love that burns the heart was common in Roman culture, and some Roman wedding traditions involved a lit torch. This, by the way, is the origin of the English idiom “carry a torch”. So my understanding of this line is that “fire and iron” is a way to refer to Cupid's two attributes, the torch and the arrows, in a generic way that makes him not obviously identifiable, but rather evokes a terrible monster or warrior. A similar interpretation is given by Thomas McCreight (“Psyche's Sisters as Medicae? Allusions to Medecine in Cupid and Psyche”, in Lectiones Scrupulosae: Essays on the Text and Interpretation of Apuleius's Metamorphoses in Honour of Maaike Zimmerman, p.159). He points out that the dual use of flame and iron is used again later in the story (V:20) when Psyche carries a lamp and a dagger to kill her husband who she still believes to be a monster. McCreight further analyses fire and iron as medical symbols. In the light of the fact that fire and iron is a recurring theme, it is a bit unfortunate that Adlington dropped the association here, as did Nisard. Bastien describes him as “waging war with flame and iron”, which is closer to the original. Serpent The serpent aspect comes from the line “sed saevum atque ferum vipereumque malum”. A word-for-word translation goes something like this: “but violent/wild/cruel/beastly (saevum, ferum) and evil (malum) like a viper (vipereum)”. The Latin vipera can mean either a snake in general or a viper in particular, and the adjective form used here is prone to being used in a metaphorical way, in particular to mean poisonous (as in viperea anima, quoted from Virgil, meaning “poisonous breath”). The viper a poisonous snake, I think the most common one around the Mediterranean. Love is commonly described as having a poisoning effect because it muddles people's judgement. Rivers black and deadly floods of pain The last two lines describe the unnamed Cupid as “making Jupiter himself tremble” (“tremit ipse Iovis”), “terrifying gods” (“numina terrificantur”), and causing rivers (“flumina”) and the dark hell (“Stygiae tenebrae”) to become terrified (“horrescunt”). I'm not sure what the last verse means literally. Etymologically, Stygiae refers to the river Styx, which is the boundary between earth (where humans live) and Hell (the Underworld where the dead live), but it often refers metonymically to the Underworld, i.e. Hell. Merriam-Webster notes that 

The third one reads as a completely different work because it is, in fact, a completely different work. The first two are different versions of the same work, both by Rabelais. 

“Abandoned women” is a once again dubious translation of “fille publique” which specifically means a prostitute and not just a “loose woman”. That's in contrast with 

That would be “A Slight Case of Sunstroke” by Arthur C. Clarke. Like most of Clarke's story, it's a hard SF story (perfectly physically plausible). It's one of two stories by Clarke where someone is killed by a death ray, the other being “Let There Be Light”. In “A Slight Case of the Sunstroke”, the setting is a football match between the national teams of two fictional Latin American countries, and the spectators have been (unknowing to them) instructed to orient reflective material in such a way as to kill a political opponent of the order giver. In “Let There Be Light”, 

This is, of course, an obvious allusion to the Emerald City in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. Except that it was written in 1827, a few decades before Baum was born, by Jane C. Loudon, in The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (available online). It could be a coincidence, but I wonder. Have other authors suggested people with red glasses seeing a world made or rubies, and people with yellow glasses seeing a world made of citrine? Or was Frank making a reference to Loudon? Or were they both part of a larger movement, and if so is it purely an arbitrary tradition or is it based on some symbolism of emeralds? How does the literary history of green spectacles match that of rose-colored glasses? (Note that I'm asking why emeralds and not other gems. The association between emeralds and green, and the symbolism of gems as precious and nice-looking, are obvious.) 

The first paragraph of chapter I “De l'origine et antiquité du grand Pantagruel” of Pantagruel, (full title: Pantagruel, Roy des dipsodes, restitué à son naturel, avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables : composez par feu M. Alcofribas abstracteur de quinte essence). This is the original 1532 text. This is the last revision of (1) made by Rabelais. (Pléiade, “Pantagruel —— Notes et variantes”, p. 1239–1241) The first paragraph of chapter I “De l'origine et antiquité du grand Gargantua” of Gargantua (full title: La vie treshorrificque du grand Gargantua, pere de Pantagruel, jadis composee par M. Alcofribas abstracteur de quinte essence. Livre plein de Pantagruelisme). As indicated in the preface, this is the text of the 1542 edition by François Juste, which is the latest one that was reviewed by Rabelais (Pléiade, Gargantua — note sur le texte, p. 1057). 

In this town, the people playing billiards in the café are experiencing some of the best entertainment there is. From the waiter's point of view, if Varajou is looking for ladies, he must be looking for an evening's pleasant chat with upper-class ladies. 

The word Murzynka is translated as “[femme] de type négroïde” in French and “Negress” in English. According to Wikipedia (note that I don't speak Polish so I cannot confirm this from personal experience), this word is neutral in Polish, or at least was at the time Lem wrote, so it would be closer to “Black” in contemporary English. See the Wikipedia page for a discussion of the connotations of this word, especially in the context of translations. Translating Murzynka as Negress does seem slightly out of place, given that the translation dates from 1970. But only slightly. Do keep in mind that Negro and Negress haven't always been offensive. Until the Civil Rights movement, it was a neutral term in the US. The only way in which it was potentially offensive is that it was often used to imply that there was a difference between Negros and non-Negros, even though such differences were generally not relevant except when viewed from a racist perspective. The same goes for the French translation, by the way: it avoids the noun “Nègre” which I think was already offensive at the time (but, like Negro, had been neutral earlier), and instead uses the expression “de type négroïde” which is purely descriptive. There is clearly no intent, either from Lem or from the French or English translators, to use offensive language here; perceiving the word Murzynka or Negress as offensive would be an anachronism. “Grass skirt” seems to be an invention of the English translators. The French translation has a straw (“paille”) skirt both times, and as far as I can make it out it's the Polish text only mentions straw (słoma, “ze słomy” means “of straw”), but the skirt only looks like (jabky ze słomy) straw (more precisely, it's straw-colored). The imagery of “steatopygous statues in anthropological museums” is a pretty direct translation of the original (“owych steatopygicznych rzeźb z epoki kamienia łupanego, jakie widuje się czasem w muzeach antropologicznych”). It is clear that the woman is meant to evoke a primitive appearance, with a reference to very old African art. The woman is connected to primitive man, and, perhaps, to primitive man's fears — a little later she is compared to Aphrodite. That and the way she is described as distant in this passage make her a possible goddess, a formidable one rather than a gentle one. 

but the association between “Stygian darkness” and the dreadriness of Hell in fact dates back from well before its adoption in English, as evidence by its use by Virgil (Georgica, III:551). So I don't think that the river (flumina) is Styx or is dark in any remarkable way, but rather the author insists that there is no barrier to Cupid's power. Love (or lust, this passage does not distinguish between the two) has affected Jupiter and other gods many times in Roman mythology. One of the best known myths about Pluto, ruler of Hell, is his abduction of Persephone, so love has reached Hell itself. As for the river, I don't know if this alludes to a specific mythological tale. Nisard translates this passage by stating that the gods themselves have been affected by Cupid and Styx failed to defend Hell against him, without mentioning a river (not Jupiter nominally). Bastien states that Cupid is feared by “the master of the gods” and that he is feared by “sea, hell and heavens”. My take on this passage is that the important point is the universality of the fear of the unnamed monster, that he affects not only humans but even the most powerful and fearsome gods. The funeral dress Prophecies are always cryptic or incomplete, and often misleading. Prophecy Twist is by no means a recent trope. The oracle didn't get anything wrong, but his words have three possible interpretations.
