What I do is I eat big meals for lunch and dinner. The total calorie intake is huge, but it comes from healthy foods like olive oil, whole grain pasta, whole grain bread. If you eat only healthy foods, you'll recuperate from exercise better, you become stronger, allowing you to exercise harder. You'll achieve equilibrium between calorie use and calorie intake at a higher level while your weight will have a healthy, normal value. So, I would suggest you stop eating any form of junk foods. No more French fries, hamburgers, cookies, cakes, ice creams, pizza's etc. etc. That will force you to get your calories from foods like brown rice, whole grain pasta, vegetables fried in olive oil etc. etc. You can then eat as much as you need to not get feel hungry at all, the amount of vitamins and minerals you get in will increase a lot, maybe by a factor 2 or 3. 

You should get at least half of your energy needs from carbs. This will build up large stores of glucose in your liver and muscles, allowing you to exercise on any time of the day. What matters is that you eat large amounts of carbs every day, it doesn't matter exactly when you eat, except that you'll find it difficult to exercise after your main mail of the day. E.g. I eat 6 meals per day, I eat breakfast twice, at midday I eat lunch and a few hours later I eat lunch again. By that time I will have eaten 500 grams of bread, which is contains about 1000 kcal worth of carbs. I then need just half an hour or so before I can do my one hour of running exercise. Then comes dinner, I'll then have 300 grams of whole grain pasta, which contains 1000 kcal worth of carbs. Before sleeping I'll eat another meal. The total calorie intake of the 6 meals is usually around 4000 kcal. Your weight loss efforts won't be compromised by eating a lot, I lost quite a bit of weight (from 63 kg to my current 55 kg) by increasing my calorie intake from 3200 Kcal per day to the current 4000 kcal per day and exercising a lot harder (running almost every day, faster and longer). What happens is that running triggers all sorts of changes in your body that are designed by evolution to make it easier for you to run, and that includes optimizing your weight as well as becoming fitter. Eating enough to prevent feeling hungry will also help you to lose weight. If you regularly feel hungry and don't eat enough, then that will trigger feedback responses (implemented via hormones) to keep larger fat reserves. The algorithm that is implemented here makes the assessment that food shortages are more likely, therefore there is a need for larger fat reserves. 

I try to get at least half of my normal exercise time on vacation. I try to run on treadmills in gyms or outside. The main issue here is the energy that you burn and how that affects your diet and sleep. If you are used to burning something of the order of 1000 Kcal during exercise then stopping with exercising for a prolonged period can cause problems with your eating and sleeping routine. 

You won't lose much weight either way, but the 20 to 30 minutes every day or every other day will allow you to improve your fitness, and then allow you to exercise harder and longer (say one hour per day, 5 times per week) so that you can start to lose weigh. When I run for an hour, I burn about 1000 Kcal. This is a significant fraction of the about 4000 Kcal I eat per day (I run almost every day for one hour). My exercise routine has a significant influence on my energy balance. However, my old routine from a decade ago when I was less fit, was to run for 20 minutes every other day. I ran just as fast as I'm running now, although I was a bit heavier. But calorie-wise you can see that the old routine was totally ineffective, because it amounts to about 170 Kcal per day. Even though I was eating a lot less, about 3000 Kcal, 170/3000 = 5.7% compared to the 25% ratio of today. 

You should do cardio exercises. If you build up your cardio fitness, you should be able to run for an hour or longer at a fast pace (13 km/h or faster). You'll then burn more than 1000 Kcal per day. You should actually eat a lot more to get there, try to eat a lot more whole grain bread, brown rice and whole grain pasta. The total calorie intake should be large enough to allow you to run fast for a long time. You should not worry about weight gain, as the focus should be on building up your cardio fitness. You'll find that even with a much higher calorie intake, your weight will not increase or even decrease a bit, provided you exercise hard enough and only eat healthy foods (only whole grain products, a lot of vegetables, at least 400 grams per day). You can also think of it this way. If you start to run then the reason why your cardio fitness will improve is fundamentally because your body will do whatever is necessary to facility your new activity. The biochemical changes are not the fundamental reason because these mechanisms were developed as a result of evolution. Now, an activity like running would only be done by our ancestors or other animals because of survival needs. Running more switches on all sorts of processes that enhance the capability of an animal to be able to run well. And that includes weight loss too. 

Replace white rice by brown rice or whole grain pasta. This contains a lot more minerals like e.g. magnesium that you need to burn energy. As pointed out here:: 

You should also make sure you eat at least 400 grams of vegetables per day, about 50 grams of tree nuts like e.g. walnuts and at least 200 grams of fruit. You should aim for a total magnesium intake from your diet of at least 500 mg. You can boost the magnesium intake by using supplements, but note that if you are not getting 500 mg from your diet then your diet is not healthy as it will be lacking other essential minerals and vitamins. 

Your goal is being able to run at a speed of slightly less than 10 km/h for 15 minutes, which isn't all that fast especially considering that it's just 15 minutes. You are currently able to run at a speed of about 8 km/h which is just fast walking speed. This suggests to me that you should work on your cardio fitness a lot more aggressively. Instead of incrementally increasing the pace to meet your goal, you should run at a significantly faster pace, say 13 km/h and then do interval training where you run for, say, 4 minutes, slow down and then increase the pace again. After a while you'll find that you can run at a constant speed comparable to that 13 km/h for 15 minutes or even longer. This means that 11 minutes for 1.5 miles should be well within reach, even at training pace. 

First, if you have concerns about your health, you need to go to your doctor. Assuming that your doctor says that this isn't due to some disease, then it's reasonable to assume that you need more sleep; 6 to 7 hours isn't all that much. If you don't want to feel sleepy, you'll need about 8 hours of sleep and a bit more if you are below the age of 25. Most people who say that they need only 6 hours of sleep actually need more sleep, but they are better than average at tolerating the effects of sleep deprivation. Recent research showed that The activity of hundreds of genes was altered when people's sleep was cut to less than six hours a day for a week . So, you're better of feeling sleepy if you sleep less than 8 hours so that you are forced to sleep more. 

While walking fast for an hour every day is good enough to be very fit compared to people who don't do cardio exercise at all, in your case this is not good enough to even approach the top level cardio fitness that you could obtain. You should add running to your routine; it may take a year or more, but eventually you should be able to run an hour a day. 

In practice, when you exercise a lot and lose water in the form of sweat, you will need to manage the amount of water you drink, you can't leave that to just feeling thirsty and drinking as a response to that. The rule of thumb is to drink 50% more than the lost water (which you can measure by weighing yourself before and after the exercise session). Also, you should not drink more than 0.8 liters per hour. So, if you have lost 1 liter, you need to drink about 1.5 liters and you should do that over the course of the next two hours. 

Cardio is all you need to lose weight. You must build up enough cardio fitness to be able to run fast and long enough, but one hour of running can burn 1000 Kcal or more. Burning the same amount of energy from lifting weights would require you to lift a weight of 100 kg over a total height of 1 km. So, you'll need to lift a heavy weight on a training machine an incredible number of times before you come close to what you can burn in just an hour of running. You can also think of it this way. The only way your excess fat can leave your body is by burning it with oxygen and converting it to CO2 and H2O. The CO2 can only be lost by exhaling it, while the H2O can also be lost as urine. In total about 84% of the lost fat mass will end up being exhaled in the form of CO2 gas, so the vast majority of your excess fat will have to leave your body via your lungs. If you do an hour of running you'll breath a lot faster during that hour than when you do strength exercises, also you'll keep on breathing at a faster rate for quite a while after the exertion. 

First make sure to do medical checkups to rule out metabolic diseases, like e.g. thyroid problems. The amount of food you eat during the entire day is similar to what I eat during breakfast alone ( 5ft 6in is similar to my height, but I weigh just 55 kg), so there might well be a metabolic problem here that needs to be addressed. Then, assuming there is no underlying medical problem, you should increase the intensity of aerobic exercise and keep that up for longer. You should build up your fitness so that you can maintain at least 200 Watts for 45 minutes or longer. You'll then burn more than 500 Kcal, and in addition the fitness you will have build up allowing you to exercise at this level, will have led to an increased basal metabolic rate. 

Heart rate monitors often don't work well, when I tried to use one, the band had to fit so tight around my waste that this was just uncomfortable. But I don't need to use one because I can always feel my heart beating so I just need to count and look at my watch. When running your heart rate should be around 150 bmp, it can be somewhat lower or higher, but if it is around 100 then you're probably not running fast enough and if it is well above 180 then you're probably running too fast for optimal training results. To measure the heart rate when you can't feel it, you need to put a finger on your wrist below the thumb. But this is not easy to do while running, so you may need to stop for ten seconds and then count the beats. Your heart rate immediately after stopping can then be a lot lower than what it was while you were running, even if the measurement took just ten seconds. The fitter you are the faster your heart rate will go down, this rate of decline is the fastest during the first few seconds and it's also a lot more when you do the measurement when you've just started to run. That's why I think it's better to learn to feel your heart beating without having to feel your pulse by putting a finger on your wrist. When you're doing strength exercises and you have excellent cardio fitness, you may find that your heart rate doesn't get very high. In my case, immediately after doing 50 pushups in a row, my heart rate will be around 90 bpm. But this is then up from the resting heart rate which in my case is slightly below 40 bpm. 

It is certainly possible, I seem to have increased my BMR in the last decade by exercising harder, longer and more frequently, while eating a lot more. My body seems to have adjusted to that by dramatically increasing the BMR. I now eat about 3800 Kcal per day while the BMR formula says that my BMR should be about 1700 Kcal/day. There is no doubt about how much I eat, because I weigh and measure all the food I eat every day. I need to do that because I eat huge amounts of food for someone my size; without measuring I would prepare too much or too little food. I also know that it is the the BMR that is extremely high and not just the total metabolic rate, because on vacation when I typically exercise a lot less, I typically lose some weight. While I then do eat a little less, the difference is only a few hundred Kcal/day; dinner in the hotel is still about 1800 Kcal, which is more than what according to the BMR formula my entire energy intake for the whole day should be. One could argue that I could have some problem with digesting food, but I have all the signs of someone with a fast metabolism. E.g. I can tolerate extremely cold conditions quite well. Wim Hof has developed another method, not really aimed at increasing the BMR, but it does have that effect too. By taking daily cold showers and certain meditation exercises, you can increase your BMR at will. E.g. Wim Hof has broken the ice endurance record, during his record attempt he doesn't shiver, his heart rate hardly increases. So, the extra heat produced by his body is not due to additional muscle contractions: Mr Hof said he can endure sub-zero temperatures as he has the ability to 'turn his own thermostat up' by using his mind. 

It seems to me that compared to other animals like e.g. gorillas, the way our body reacts to exercise or inactivity is different. We need to do quite a bit of hard physical exercise to build up muscle mass and keep all that muscle mass. Gorillas, in contrast, seem to be able to eat and sleep all day long and still be extremely strong. Of course, they will still get some exercise by moving around, climbing trees, but I don't think gorillas are in the habit of voluntarily pushing themselves to their limits compared to how people in the gym are pushing themselves to their limits. If they climb a tree, then that is exercise, but it's presumably much farther within the limit of their muscle capacity then when we do pull-ups. So, is there something fundamentally different about human physiology that predisposes us to become couch potatoes much faster than other animals? 

You should start to run again, because that's the way you can make your body feel that you need to eat a lot. It's easier to eat 2000 kcal or 3000 kcal per day and get to a surplus of a few hundred kcal per day when you're running a lot, compared to not burning a lot of energy. It looks like you can easily get to a surplus energy intake when you need to eat a lot less, but the human body doesn't work that way. Our metabolism evolved hundreds of millions years ago, it's a very robust system. If you run a lot then because animals only exert themselves for survival (e.g. getting to food), mechanisms will kick in that make your body better adapted to this situation, so running will become easier. For most people this will mean that they'll lose weight, but if you are underweight, you'll gain weight (provided that you're not overdoing it, you must avoid overtraining). In contrast, our brains only evolved a few hundred thousand years ago, it's not yet fully optimized, we're prone to depression and other mental issues. So, what you want to do is rely on the more primitive but robust mechanisms instead of your brain when it comes to gaining weight. Attempting to micromanage your diet when your body should do that by itself isn't a good idea. It's better to rely on the more primitive feeling like hunger and make yourself hungry by exercising a lot and then eat to make that hungry feeling go away. The diet should consist of whole grains, brown rice, a lot of vegetables and fruits, moderate amounts of protein and moderate amounts of fats. The total calorie intake should be large enough so that you don't feel hungry and that then includes days when you've been doing heavy exercise. The amount of calories you should be eating should be at least 2000 Kcal per day but it can be a lot more. E.g. I'm just as tall as you are and I weigh 54 kg. I eat about 4000 Kcal per day, I eat 500 grams of whole grain bread and 250 grams (weighed uncooked) brown rice, or whole grain pasta or 1 kg of potatoes a day. I eat 500 grams of vegetables a day. I only eat a small amount of meat and add a small amount of fats to my food. Now being as big as you are, this shows that your stomach is not too small to hold large amounts of foods. But you need to gradually increase the quantities of food to get your body adapted to digest large amounts of food. When you're still struggling to eat a large quantities, you should eat larger amounts of meat and add more fat, later when you are able to eat larger amounts of food you'll be able to get enough proteins and other nutrients from vegetables and grains and then you can reduce the amount of meat. You can reduce the amount of fat if you are able to get enough energy from carbs.
