While many people use the term double negative to describe languages that require multiple words to be negative without canceling the meaning, really, double negative just describes the presence of two negative words which can happen in both types of languages. The better term to use is negative concord to describe agreement amongst certain words to all be negative or not because that describes what's going on under the surface. Once you have negative concord, you can have a wide number of elements that are negative without changing the meaning and thus getting even tredecuple negation, just like gender agreement in most languages: change one noun and all the adjectives go with it. 

The above is summarized from “La influencia del sustrato euskera en hispano-romance” (Mary C. Irtbarren-Argaiz). She goes into great detail evaluating the claims and sourcing them, some of which she doesn't necessarily agree with, but I've included some of the alternate views she mentions. 

I'd imagine that most languages with a definite/indefinite distinction have the possessive adjectives imply definiteness, with any other forms (via pronouns, etc) allowing for idefiniteness determiners. 

Standard English doesn't have negative concord, so having two negatives cancels things out. But Asturian (like many dialects of English) does, and so there is no cancelation. There's nothing wrong in Asturian saying, for instance (bold words in negative) 

The only way in English is to switch to an alternate structure. Ditto in the Romance languages, which language depending have different ways of adjusting structure so that the possessive adjective (if it stays as an adjective) loses its determinative prowess. 

More generally, what factors determine which phoneme a non-phonemic foreign sound gets rounded to in a specific language when there are multiple possibilities available? Is the choice always consistent within a language or even per speaker? For example, I suspect that Hebrew roundings of French vowel sounds aren't always consistent: I've heard /y/ rounded to both /i/ (e.g. /brisel/ Bruxelles and for some speakers /ti/ tu) and /u/ (e.g. /fondu/ fondue and for other speakers /tu/ tu). 

I've also seen measures of phonological distance used to cluster English dialects and creoles (see for example Clustering Dialects Automatically: A mutual information approach), but I've not seen a similar study for syntactic distance. For a description of approaches to quantifying syntactic distance between languages see for example A Vector Space Model for Syntactic Distances Between Dialects. 

This is known as an ephelcystic s and is analogous to the ephelcystic t in "Parle-t-il français?". It's euphonic rather than etymological, used to avoid a hiatus between the imperative and the y/en. I believe that historically there would have been an elision instead ("retourn'y") but I don't have a source confirming this. When still considered incorrect, this type of speech error is called pataquès, from the example erroneous phrase "je ne sais pas-t-à qu'est-ce". By contrast, I believe that the -s in Class II and Class III imperatives are etymological. There's a reasonable summary of this on the French Wikipedia articles about French liason and ephelcystic phonemes. 

I am aware that it might not be possible to fully satisfy all of these desiderata with just one hierarchy; and that perhaps the "hierarchy" would be only partially-ordered rather than "linearly" ordered. That's OK; I just want to get as close as I can. To start with I'm going to consider just the following accidents: 

Does anyone here know of anyone who actually knows anything about these questions? Can anyone here point me toward a resource (preferably a URL) that answers some of them? Would anyone here care to speculate about any of it that no resource (as far as you know) definitively answers? Thanks. 

Pluractionality, evidentiality, mirativity, validationality, etc., I might work in later. Also, "modality/mode/mood" might be two (or more?) accidents instead of one; so might voice. And possibly not every language would have every accident; for that matter maybe some languages don't have a "verbs" "part-of-speech", though I gather most have something close enough. My original hypothesis, which might be complete hogwash, or might be only partially true, is that the hierarchy is more-or-less the following: Aspect > Voice > Tense > Polarity > Modality/mode/mood And here's why; Of those five accidents, the one that has the most influence on the actual meaning of the verb is Aspect. Of those five accidents, modality/mode/mood tends to be about what the speaker expects the addressee to do with the clause, or how the clause fits into the discourse, or how the speaker feels about the clause, etc.; and tends to apply to the whole clause rather than just the verb. It doesn't really change the meaning of the verb itself. And tense is intermediate between aspect and m/m/m. Up 'til that, I'm pretty sure my reasons are opinions shared by most professional linguists; the thing I'm not sure of is that it has any significant influence on most languages' morphology. As for the rest of the hierarchy; I guess that Voice is between Aspect and Tense. I guess that Polarity is between Tense and Modality/Mode/Mood. 

According to Wolfram Math World, Buchowski's paradox concerns the use of comparative adjectives in apparently paradoxical statements such as "My younger brother is older than me" (possible if the speaker has two older brothers). Who is Buchowski? Has the paradox been discussed in any depth in a publication, or was it just an offhand observation? 

Apart from Scots, the closest languages to English in terms of lexical difference are probably the various English-based creoles, such as Tok Pisin, Bislama or Jamaican Patois. These have a mostly English vocabulary base, even though much of their grammar derives from from non Indo-European languages. Unfortunately I've not found many numbers to back this up. The closest I found so far is the following diagram from A Grammar of Pichi by Kofi Yakpo, showing the lexical distance of Pichinglis (spoken in Equatorial Guinea) to a number of other languages including English. 

Yes. Nouns in Telugu are inflected for number, gender and 7 cases. However, the small closed class of adjectives (as opposed to nouns used adjectivally) does not decline. 

Creoles are not usually viewed as members of the parent languages' family. Nor (obviously) are they viewed as isolates: typically they are simply grouped with other creoles that share a parent. For example see ethnologue's classification. This is even more true for highly mixed languages such as Michif. This is partly as despite the prevalence of phrases such as 'English-based creole', determining the 'dominant' parent is typically controversial or meaningless. Furthermore, since creole grammar is largely original, assigning the creole to a language family is of limited use.
