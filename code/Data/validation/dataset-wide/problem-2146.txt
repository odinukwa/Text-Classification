While you may believe the statement is incorrect, there can be the question of how well can you know precisely the context well enough to ensure that you are believed more than the other person. For example, consider the question of, "What is 2+2?" that some may answer "4" and others may answer "22" and others may ask for clarification of what are "2" and "+" to denote as one could infer the natural number addition and arrive at an answer of "4" and some may infer that each "2" is a character and the "+" is a concatenation operation so that the result would be "22." How prepared were you for me to claim the numbers as characters? Similarly, I could throw out a challenge of "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 3. I'll give 10 guesses to hit it and claim you won't be able to do it," where I could think of some obscure number like pi minus e plus 1 that I doubt many people would guess in their first dozen guesses. Beware of going head to head with those that may enjoy messing with your mind. 

Keeping agreements is rather important for something else to consider here. "Strengths-based Leadership" also has various tips on building trust, depending on which of Gallup's talent themes someone has. Lastly, "How To Win Friends and Influence People" has some ideas that may be useful in building relationships: 

How certain are you of making political missteps? Perhaps the executive management thought of keeping on their friends and kicked out the rest that you would have no control to do anything about. Another component here is how well do you think the acting manager would remember this situation in the future. While you could try something like, "Hey, remember those days at XYZ..." it may or may not go anywhere. 

I wouldn't call it thick but rather having a different hat to wear just like when one is driving that one has to be aware of things to note around them. 

Experience would be the most obvious choice. This way all you are implying is that you have used these technologies and could have varying levels of skill. Skill would also work as you are identifying specific areas though this doesn't always work as some software may not be seen as a skill. Proficiencies would be a more formalized term if you wanted something a bit more exotic than experience. 

While i am also not a friend of some HR people trying to act like they could asses how smart a candidate is by such questions, just let them play theirs games, they are probably aware that the question is well known. 

General rationale: If a manager makes a decision, and an team member acts like that guy does, he needs to leave the team ASAP (knowledge transfer), by all means. Talk to your manager, offer him to assist (e.g. by keeping back the announcement of your promotion) until they found a replacement for the guy. Pass all information which you think is essential in evaluating the situation to you manager. Suggest to offer the contractor a 3 month contract, search for a replacement behind his back, identify people in his team who are essential to replacing him swiftly and have crossed his path in a bad way in the past, and talk to them in a tentative way like "we may need Mr. X at another position soon, which of his knowledge/skills can you replace". Make a list of names which you think are loyal to him, and look for internal replacements (so that you can swap them to other teams if there are problems). Make use of external consultants in the transition phase. 

I also left research when i was 35, and had no big problems - but I was always more a broad type than a specialist. 

You could ask your boss (in general, in a "who is actually responsible if our service is used as part of something illegal" way) to put up a note that customers take responsibility against the company for making sure that they do transmit money only to legitimate recipients, and put up some examples of scam/illegal behavior. 

I do technical interviews. I very often do not ask the people at all about the stuff they will be doing, but about loosely related stuff they have been doing. The rationale behind this is simple: 

Everything depends if the employee actually was stupid enough to tell that e was fired. normally there is no reason to disclose the fact that somebody was fired at all. If it comes to light in the team that he was fired then the only explanation should be that keeping him in the team would not have been good for the team, together with the instruction not to speculate about the details. 

Consider that if you answer, "No," there could well be the question of, "What would you like to be doing that you aren't?" or "What kinds of things could be done to change that?" where if your answer is, "I have no idea," then there could be issues. If you have things you'd like to gain experience using then putting those forward may be useful though consider what is the payoff for the company as they would want to see some ROI here by you gaining in whatever you chose to do to build your career. "I hope this is building your career" would be the kind of upbeat hopeful statement that a lot of people may say as it sounds nice though they may have a similar issue that you have. Perhaps you are reading into this various promises which could be worth noting somewhere as this isn't that different than telling an athlete about to play a game, "I hope you win the game," which may or may not mean a lot of concern is being given. 

Are there pieces of the project in terms of architecture, usability, or other project roles besides development and testing that could be where you see yourself adding value to the project? Course another way to spin this would be to consider if the team could split up the testing so that it isn't all on your shoulders and thus that load is handled by various people. 

For an initial interview, I can see plenty of logic in meeting at a Starbucks or somewhere public so that there can be some form of screening beyond a phone screen. The idea here is to get an idea of your style and what kind of persona would bring. In some ways the key here is to see if you fit culturally as others have mentioned. Think of this as a basic test to see if you are OK to let into the office and meet others. There can be the interesting notes about social etiquette in this setting. For example, do you get a snack and drink here that costs a lot or do you take nothing and go right into an interview mode? How do you handle other people being around? How do you deal with a busy place versus a quiet office? There can be some tests that some could see as stressful as well as how well do you uphold confidentiality in a public setting. My personal take is to have whatever kind of regular beverage you'd usually have as this may be seen as setting a precedent. How big of an issue is it that it takes you 30 seconds to say what your order would be? This can be interesting. My typical Starbucks beverage would be a "Triple Venti Caramel Macchiato" which likely isn't that bad. As for why this place, that can be a good question though the key is to consider how you are framing the question. "Why in the world would you choose this place?" could be seen as a bit dramatic though there could well be various explanations to consider not the least of which is how do you know this person isn't going to do something horrible? The only tweak to make in the interview preparation is to be aware of what is available at the coffee shop that you may want as well as what time of day would you be having this food. In most cases, I don't think it would be judged though if you ordered a handful of snacks at a Starbucks for a 10:30 am meeting, that may raise an eyebrow from the interviewer wondering, "Are you trying to freeload me here? Why would you need to eat that many snacks at this hour?" or something similar. 

It is nothing personal, it is just business. This is a phrase you'll hear in every day life in the corporate world. Everyone has different abilities to deal with stress - what is considered chaotic and stressful in some companies will be considered normal in others. It all depends on what the company environment is. The sort of stressful levels for people at some consulting companies (say, "white shoe" consulting companies like KPMG or McKinsey) will be too much for many people. Add to that the "up or out" mentality and some people would be reduced to tears in months. People who thrive in those environments "die of boredom" in less stressful environments. 

The project manager's goal is to get the project done. Hopefully on time. Hopefully on spec. Hopefully under budget. That PM would like you to help the other staff to get this done. As a contractor, they can't demand that you stay overtime. That would be one of the sort of things that turns you into an employee (in the eyes of the IRS). However the majority of PMs that I have worked for will be all too willing to cut you loose when the project is done if you are a clockwatcher and won't help with some overtime. My advice is to help "babysit" the other developers and help them get this project done. Don't be working 10-12 hour days every day. There are times when you can help get one developer's backlog done - buddy up with one of the guys and help them get over the hump. That is the point of "teamwork" and what the slogan "there is no I in team" means. 

No. In large companies, these policies are always concocted by people far distant from the front lines. Neither you nor your boss will be able to change them. The closest you might get will be to redefine your job with a new title. This is why many companies have job titles like "Business Analyst 3" so as to provide different pay bands for different levels of skill/talent/ability. In the case of my current employer [1], the only way to get more than a 3% raise was to quit and then get rehired. This was something done by most of the developers here. In my case, the pointy haired boss liked to lowball new hires [2], knowing full well that raises were almost impossible to get [3]. Quitting to work as a contractor yielded a $30k/year raise for myself [4]. These policies lead to people whining "we can't get qualified people" [5]. They are really saying "we can't get people to work at the wage we are willing to pay" [6]. There is really nothing that you, or your boss, can do to change the policies, so you'll have to vote with your feet. Or decide that there are more important things than money [7]. In some cases, the appeal to remote authority (perhaps a "policy" or "mean" executive) is a way for your boss to say "no" without sounding "mean" to you [8]. The only way to deal with this situation is to always be ready to move on. Notes: 1 - It is a privately owned company in the Fortune 500. 2 - Married new hires would automatically get $10k/year more than an equally qualified single worker. 3 - Unless there was a policy that year saying "people getting more than $X don't get raises this year", then everyone would get a 3% raise. Even people about to be fired for cause would get 2% raises. 4 - When hired back, I didn't get to stay at the new level, but basically I get about $20k/year more than I did when quitting about 1 year previously. 5 - Our office makes products that need lots of business domain knowledge. Even after "bridging" (where my absense was ignored/bridged to be the same [for some benefits] as if I never left, at "6 years" I am the lowest "seniority" person in this office. Many people have been working for this corporation for up to 19 years. They knew I left for more money, and with a recent deathmarch, they need folks who know what the product is and what the business is. 6 - Generally, when CEOs whine about a perceived shortage of talent, they are lobbying the government to save the businesses from the free market; they want talent but without paying the market wages for such talent. 7 - In one co-worker's case, he values time off more than high wages, even though he is the highest paid developer here. 8 - In the worst cases, this sort of appeal is done because the boss does not like filling out the paperwork and uses this as an excuse to avoid work.
