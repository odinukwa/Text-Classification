If your trying to move up in weight, try this. 15 reps at 10 lbs(This is your warm up set to get your form straight and wake up the muscles ) 10 reps at 15 lbs (This set adds a little more resistance but still light enough to maintain form) 6 reps at 25 (go all out on this one and see try and maintain form. ) If you did the last set ok, repeat the 6 reps at 25 lbs. The point of these rep ratios is to get your muscles in tune with good form. Once your muscles are warmed up you can start really lifting hard. keep adding to the reps on the last set and soon you'll be doing 25 lbs for ten reps. 

Break up your muscle groups up and do legs on Friday so you'll have a couple days to recover before you hit the court on Tuesday. Playing volleyball with sore quads sounds like torture. 

In my personal opinion, I think you get a better contraction when you arch your back and activate more back muscles. To add to this post, another big mistake is to start swinging the bar down when you go up in weight. 

This is a tip. I'm terrible at waking up so when I lift at 6am coffee or pre workout does wonders for me. Also stretching is very neccesary when lifting and running in the morning. Save yourself alot of injury and grief. 

I think the rate of muscle loss would be most affected by diet. The body would have to stay catabolic to decrease the amount of muscle loss. This is such a great question. I think to really find the answer to this, you would have to look at the cellular level of the muscle fibers and see if there are any differences between muscle composition in professional powerlifters and bodybuilders. 

This is a loaded question. First off, Everyone's body responds differently to different rep ranges. I'm going to give your a broad answer and say all rep ranges are good. The reason is because you never want to let your muscles get into a routine. Another point to be made is that heavier weight recruits more of the muscle to perform the movement. So doing 6x5 is technically better for building muscle than 4x12. I like heavier weight and lower reps on compound movements like bench press and rows, but I add more reps on isolated movements like bumbell flies for inner chest and preacher curls. 

I have been lifting weights for around a year now and my first program I followed was starting strength. Since then I have moved onto greyskull and my training week typically looks like this: Wednesday 

Note: there can and will be crossover of the two. Each of these can be broken down even further. Before I get into that though, there is a little bit of a standard when we talk about rep ranges (keep in mind, this is my opinion from experience and research and it is also quite a simplified look at it): 

I will split my answer into two parts. Firstly answering your more specified question, and then secondly answering the question in the subject. 

People who train to look better are called body builders. You can't simply class all body builders together however, since they are also training towards different goals. Some things do remain the same in body building such as symmetry, low body fat/water during competition and higher muscle mass then the average person. At one end of the spectrum you have the Mr Olympia's (Ronnie Coleman, Arnold Schwarzenegger), these are people who are looking to put on a ridiculous amount of muscle while keeping everything symmetrical and 'proportional'. They can walk around on stage at around 135kg at 3% body fat. Then you have people who want to achieve an aesthetic look and train towards a physique category (Steve Cook, Lazar Angelo). There people want to put on a lot of muscle but keep it to a level where it's not overdone. Everything needs to keep to strict proportions such as a small waste with the V taper laterals. 

Unfortunately there's no quick fix to getting fit. When you say your shins are super tight - make sure this isn't shin splints, since it may put you out of the run altogether if you continue to train on it without proper care - you may want to google or youtube some videos to double check and be sure to stretch/rest them appropriately. In terms of calves, for me at least, the first time I blitz a muscle is always the worst in terms of burning sensation and recovery. If you are able to push your calves to their limit before the race day (while leaving enough recovery time before the big day!), I think it would be beneficial. This means you should be aiming the best you can produce already. The only thing you may possibly be able to 'rush' is your mental game since it will probably be the biggest factor for you on the 5k run. Always remember that your mind will be telling you that you can't go on or your body is too sore to continue. The best way to overcome this is with a positive training partner (thus the use for personal trainers) or if you can't find anyone suitable in time, try and set goals for yourself. Goals can be either time related or length related, but make sure they're actually challenging. Remember to tell yourself - pain is temporary. You'll probably have sore calves for a day or even a week after, but after that week you'll forget that the pain even happened. What you won't forget happening is your gained fitness since it will stay with you as long as you maintain it. Also, any time you begin to walk or stop moving when you could have actually run another kilometre is simply you cheating yourself, no one else. In terms of running every day - you need to listen to your body and see how it feels - but I would advise against training every day. You can stay active daily meaning you can still do other activities that keep your heart rate up but if you run one day, your muscle groups used need time to recover. If you attempt to run while these muscle groups haven't recovered you will start to fall into over training which will actually bring more bad than good. 

Some men carry fat in their lower chest as body fat goes up(this applies to myself). So I notice I lose alot of lower pec definition when I'm bulking. You might fall into the same category. I like wider grip dips to get that lower contraction. You could set up something like that at home with some chairs. 

Look up Pitbull from strength cartel. He competes at 160 weight class and moves unbelievable amounts of weight. He's probably just as strong as Rich Piana. If you want to get strong, You should look into power lifting routines instead. I know you mentioned Rich Piana who is a bodybuilder. His goals aren't to get strong but to get big. Calorie surplus does help ALOT too. 

I had a similar problem with elliptical machines for cardio training. My leg muscles became very used to the movement so it became hard for me increase my heart rate. I realized that there are two points of power to make the elliptical spin: from your legs pushing on the pedals, and from your arms pushing and pulling on the handles. I was very dominant with my legs so I tried to focus more energy on pulling and pushing from the arm handles. This definitely changed the dynamics for endurance resulting in my heart rate jumping in a short amount of time which was my goal. In short, you can adjust the amount of energy you are using from your legs to your arms or vise versa to add difficulty depending on your current strengths. 

There's a lot of weight training movements that can improve hamstring strength. I think a great one to get your legs back into condition collectively would be barbell squats and leg presses. Proper form is KEY if you want to activate your hamstrings. Make sure you keep all your weight in your heels and off your toes. 

Your optimal grip is that perfect medium between to close and too wide. You'll know it's the right grip because you'll feel a dominant chest contraction. If your grip is too close you'll feel it in your arms. If your grip is too wide you'll feel it in your front delts. Close grip bench press is great for triceps. It works well with the incline variation too. Wide grip bench press is very dangerous. It puts too much direct tension on the front delts that don't have alot of strength in the bench position. This can cause a tear in the delt or a rotator cuff injury. This is a very serious injury that you don't want to ever deal with. SO.... depending on what muscle you want to target, inter change a regular grip and close grip. You'll know when your grip is too wide when you start feeling pain in the shoulders. 

I've finally reached the point where it's harder for me not to exercise. Naturally, looking around for info, I've discovered something that was not previously known to me: recovering from workouts isn't just about rebuilding the muscles, but also about recovering from stress, and recovering some depleted resources (such as the glycogen). I've also read that our body adapts, and the recovery time decreases, but I couldn't find anything that will help me figure out: 

I am no exercise addict, but I do have the willpower to exercise almost every day. Hell, I'll even exercise twice daily! Though I suspect I shouldn't. I've read a bit about exercise recovery (I'd like to say "A lot", but by comparison, I suspect it's not that much). There's a lot of emphasis about exercise recovery. What do we need to recover from? I know our body starts out using glycogen (first the glycogen stored in the muscle, then the liver?), and if we continue to cause trauma to the muscle without letting it heal properly first, we will lose more than we gain. But how much time do we need to recover from different types of exercise? For example, I've come across claims that you should get a day's rest between HIIT sessions. However, in the Tabata study (I have very little patience. a 4-minute workout? PERFECT! though I do get too close to vomiting...), the subjects worked out 5 days a week (4 days a week on the Tabata protocol, 1 day 30-min endurance followed by half the tabata protocol - 4 sets), which means at least 2 consecutive days of HIIT. So the question is, what does one need to recover from, and how long would it take for, say, someone who isn't especially well-conditioned? (of course, I know this is variable, so I don't expect a precise answer. I'm asking for you to shed as much light as you can on the subject :) ) 

(I do not specify a specific type of workout or frequency because I'm actually interested to know how this varies with different types of workouts, not just how it's relevant to my specific workout) 

Currently, my workout consists of (exclusively) high-intensity exercises (some sprinting HIIT, pullups, and more). After a few attempts at research and help from this community, I've come to accept that I can't do this every day (until recently, I was sure there's no way I would actually want to exercise every day). However, I'm hoping that there are some things I can do in between to further some goals - such as improving balance and flexibility. From what I understand, there are many types of stretching, and it generally don't interfere with the recovery. As for balance, from what I understand it requires the use of core muscles, so I'm guessing... don't do it if you've worked out the core muscles the day before? So, what can I do and what shouldn't I do in my rest days? (btw, I have gymnastic rings, so...) 

In my opinion all gym programs work. Lets face it, they all have you doing something active in the gym. The first major thing that separates all gym workouts is most of them have different goals in mind. This is the first part of picking the best gym workout for you. You have to ask yourself, what do you want? The reasoning for this, is because, in my opinion, the best gym workout for you, is the one that you can commit to. If you enjoy the workout, if you see results from the workout, stick with it. I can't stress this enough. The biggest downfall everybody has with excersize is consistency. There's no point doing the 'best workout in the world' if you can't convince yourself to complete it. By the sounds of things in your case, you enjoy strength training. From your knowledge and the size of the lifts, I am going to assume your still a beginner. So what your going to want to do is find a strength training program that is aimed at beginners. My recomandation to you is the well-known book and program, Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe. But by all means, as I mentioned earlier, you are encouraged to do your own research and try and find other programs which may appeal to you even more and there a vast range of other strength training programs such as Stronglifts 5x5. Best of luck, and remember, stick with it. You won't have to lose your gains is you never stop training properly. 

In my oppinion, there are several different goals people have when lifting weights. As you have mentioned in your question, there is look/size/strength. There are also others such as endurance/conditioning. I think everything can really be put into two classes; 

I think the answer to this question is simple. With compound strength training movements, (such as the bench press which you mentioned) they are helped by good form. Someone with bad form can increase their lifts drastically over a short period of time simply by fixing common errors. Think of it this way, the first time you get on a bike, your form is terrible and you need training wheels. Once you know how to operate the bike properly, you will be able to ride a bike for life. Now the flip side of this is, how fast or long can you ride the bike for? If you trained for years and were able to ride the bike 150km in a short period of time, coming back and attempting the same feat won't be possible after a long layoff.
