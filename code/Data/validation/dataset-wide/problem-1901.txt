You have a few months left and you are free! Just count the days. I would also recommend to start planning on what you want to do after your contract runs out. It will keep you focused and distracted from the stress. 

Check all the companies that are going to be there. You can check them online. You want to see what they do, the company mindset, if it is a startup, how they are currently doing. If there is something of a particular interest they do, make a note to ask that question. Avoid any questions of a questionable/political nature. Most companies will refuse to answer them and may get annoyed. Determine if you can see every stand in time. If not put the ones you are least interested in last. If the fair is pretty big, I'd also recommend to get a map beforehand and plan out your route. Bring a carrier bag, 10 resumes (although you might not need them), business cards (if you have any), notebook and a pen (although you will get lots of them free) and a phone. I'd recommend the business cards mention something like Linkedin/Twitter/Email. I would also recommend to tailor CVs/Resumes for certain stands that you are most interested in. They will probably not take them, but if they show an interest they have something to look at. 

Read the I9 form itself: $URL$ It answers your question for you, which is that a certified official copy of your birth certificate, along with a document from List B (see the form, last page) is fine, and legally MUST be accepted. From the form: 

No, the device is used by the business to generate value for the business. You're not more responsible for this than an employee at McDonalds is responsible for the grill breaking. Even if you HAD spilled coffee on it, I suspect you cannot be forced to replace the device either. In the US, it would likely be illegal for a company to do this (unless maybe it was intentional). From this page from the state of California: $URL$ 

You should check your company's policy, but typically you'd not clock in until you are at work and ready to work. If getting to the lot at 830 is the only way to ensure you can get the shuttle and arrive on time, that's what you should plan to do. It doesn't seem this would be any different than taking a public bus to your office. 

No. A lot of what you write in the CV is priming the reader. This is where you set predefined expectations of who you are. If they aren't mentioned, then the reader defines them based on their personal experience. By setting a salary in the CV you risk the following. 

There are litigation cases where people have done what you said. Even if a contract isn't signed stating IP rights, if you discussed the plan with your previous employer while employed by them they can claim a right to the work (depending on where you live). Example: $URL$ $URL$ (Outcome of the case). There was another one in the UK which the ex-employee lost the case. 

However your description it sounds like a constructive dismissal. If this is the case, there are legal implications depending on where you live. However no really wins when it goes the legal route, it is normally best to look for another job. The priority is protecting your reputation in such instances. So make sure you document everything and show that if any incident has happened what was the outcome, etc. I would also feel him out in private. For example, if something is not attainable you can discuss what training, etc you need. If the plan is to replace you, they won't even entertain this. 

I don't think you can. You'd be directly competing with your employer and it would be reasonable to assume you have access to their code. If you want to continue working at Google or Facebook, find another side project that doesn't compete with them, and clear it with them that it would be ok to work on it (they may have plans to enter a market they aren't yet in). Or you can quit and work on this project, but you still have the possibility that you've seen their code, so you'd likely have to wait to even start for a few years. Only a lawyer can help you here I would think. 

As for contacting the company, I would try to contact the supervisor again. It's possible that the person was not in and not heard your message yet or that they are busy and perhaps have forgotten to get back to you. Ideally you'll have found the required documentation for the I9 and your message will be that you have the necessary information to complete it, let me know when you want me to come in. Alternatively you can stop by in person. However if they don't get back to you after that, I would probably say you need to continue your job search as they may have found someone else that did have their stuff together. 

The best times to hit the stands you want is early in the morning or just after lunch. They will not be as busy and the people on the stand will be more focused on you. If the stand is busy, wait your turn. Don't try to butt in on someone elses conversation, even if it is interesting. If you have questions on things you over hear wait until you can talk to someone on the stand. Don't be afraid to ask for freebies even if you don't plan to talk to anyone on the stand. :) Don't overstay your welcome on a stand. If they have answered your questions, say thanks and if there is nothing else find another stand to look at. I've seen a couple of instances where some people will just stay at the stand doing nothing. Don't be afraid to go back later if you had a further question. Make a note of what stands impressed you for later. If you get requests for callbacks/interviews arrange a time and make a note of it and the person you were talking to. If they aren't HR, it can be common they forget about you. Don't waste peoples time if you are not a fit for the company. For example we would often get many people interested in what the company does but didn't want a job with us. That is fine. It was the ones that were clearly not remotely qualified and just kept talking in the hopes of us magically saying "you are hired!". You are just wasting your time in these instances. A good question I saw (apart from asking about internships) was "What skills do I need to learn in the next six months to make myself look competitive at an interview in your company? It is common for people on the stand to be a spread of the employees in the company. So ask something like "So do you all do the same job?". It will give you an idea of who you should be talking to. 

I'd say never. When I'm involved with interviews I'm only concerned with making sure they have the required skills for the job. Ive never thought we should hire one person over another based on nonwork related items on a resume. On the other hand you might find someone that disapproves of something you enjoy and pass you up. 

I wouldn't say there's any issue leaving. You've been there four years which is a fairly long time nowadays and if you dont think you'll be happy in your new role you should move on, especially since like the change was done without your employer discussing it with you. Normally such a conversation takes place specifically to ensure the employee is comfortable with it, and your career path should have been important to them. Just resign like you normally would; you appreciate what they've done for you so far but you're interested in the new opportunity. 

So you have a couple of issues to address here. Dealing with people who are older then you. The person older then you is going to have more experience (certainly more life experience). They will also have different expectations of what to expect from a manager. So you need to set the expectation of your experience with them. I would recommend to start off with something like. "I have been in this role for [insert time] so what I am going to show you is more company process and why the company does X a certain way". Older people may have dealt with different managers, so they expect you to lead rather then come with "I don't know". There is a quick way to see if this is the case. If the person comes with a problem and expects you to solve it, then they have not had much manager interaction/experience (cover that later). Example: "I ran the program but it is giving me error XYZ. What do I do?" On the other hand, if they come to you with a problem and detail what they need to solve it then they have had experience with managers. In this instance you see what resources you can offer to help them. If it is outside your ability to give, point them to their manager. Example: "I ran the program but it is giving me error XYZ. Can you tell me where I can get the error code list?" Managing people in a non-management role. The number one point you have to realise is that you are not their leader, nor manager. You do not have the ability to boss them around. So if a situation arises where rank has to be pulled, you need to refer them to their manager. Don't get involved with it. You are there to grow their skills in the areas they are not aware of, and focus on that. Where the person comes to you on how to solve a problem, I would recommend reading up on the GROW model. It is a technique to teach them rather then keep coming back to you like a search engine. This can be a case of answering their questions with questions that lead to the answers. You get a better understanding of where they are at. Example: Them: "I ran the program and got error XYZ. What do I do?" You: "What is the details of that error message in the manual?" Them: "I don't have a manual". ... So the actual problem is they don't have the manual. Get them the manual. However if you know the answer isn't there, then read the answer with them and then explain how you find more information from there. The main point is don't just answer their question (even though it is tempting). Dealing with people with a technical stronger background. This combined with the others can be the most troublesome. As mentioned earlier you set your expectation of your technical area, so they know where your leadership line ends. If they start to question why something is done a certain way, avoid "Because it is always that way". Try to explain why that is, or refer them to management or a senior person if it is outside your expertise. Likewise if they ask numerous technical questions on how the system works vs other systems (technical knowledge). Acknowledge that the question is a good one and that it is outside your area of expertise. I can't stress enough be honest that is outside of your expertise. I would even go so far as to tell them that what they mentioned is interesting and write it down (to read up on later). If they continue to interrupt in such a manner, ask them to make a note of the questions and you can find the answers for them offline (if in a training scenario). The main point is not to get into confrontation with them on technical issue. Instead defer. 

You list your employment using the name of the company sending you paychecks. So even though you were on site at your former employer, you're working for the consulting company. The tricky part is that you did do the same job with the same responsibility. I don't think that's necessarily bad though, a career is focus in one area. 

I think in general you'll have to get the certifications. If there's no choice but to travel, I'd talk to your manager and explain the cost to travel is not something you can absorb, and see if they will pay for it. A reasonable employer will work with you to figure this out. You don't give your country, but I believe this would be ok in the USA, even if you had to pay for everything yourself. The job now requires this certification, so you'll have to get it or be terminated, if that's what you're being told.
