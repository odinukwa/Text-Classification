Full employment is rather a deceiving term. It suuggest that 100% of the workforce is employed. However, there are so many reasons why this cannot be achieved and should not be achieved. Typical workforce would include people who are studying, people who have just got out of colleges, differently-abled etc who might not be supposed to be working in the way we assume they should. So at any point of time there will always exist some structural, frictional unemployment. Adjusting which we get the natural rate of employment or unemployment. Economists do not confuse between these two terms. You will find terms like potential output, zero output gap etc which refer to the same state and are technically more sound. Also, every level of output is an equilibrium point. The question is whether the economy is at its natural level of output or potential output or long term output level. At that level, natural employment level should prevail. 

Consider an economy with $n$ consumers with an identical utility function, which is quasilinear in $x$: $$ u_i(x,y) = x+u(y) $$ If we want to represent all consumers by a single representative consumer, what would his utility function look like? Here is my current solution. For every consumer, the demand for $y$ depends only on the price. It is determined by the equality: $$ u'(y_i) = p_y $$ so: $$ y_i(p, m_i) = (u')^{-1}(p) $$ (where $m_i$ is the income of consumer $i$). Hence, the aggregate demand is: $$ Y(p, M) = n \cdot (u')^{-1}(p) $$ (where $M$ is the aggregate income of all consumers). Let's assume that a representative consumer has utility function $U$, which is also quasilinear in $x$: $$ U(x,y) = x+U(y) $$ Then, his demand will be: $$ Y(p, M) = (U')^{-1}(p) $$ Equating the above expressions for the aggregate demand gives: $$ (U')^{-1}(p) = n \cdot (u')^{-1}(p) $$ $$ U'(y) = u'({y \over n}) $$ $$ U(y) = n\cdot u({y \over n}) $$ So, the utility function of the rep. agent is: $$ U(x,y) = x + n\cdot u({y \over n}) $$ Is this calculation correct? 

There is a sense of differentiation thus this is not competitive market clearly. Government regulations in an industry cannot be regarded as a monopoly as government mostly will decide on a price ceiling or floor and not the quantity of transport supplied. Since there are only 4 firms this is an oligopoly clearly. They can collude to restrict output and raise prices if it is within the limits set by government. Maybe the government has set the price to actually prevent collusion. 

Money supply accounts for all the 'money' in circulation in the economy and the money itself has many forms. However, in a nutshell we can understand it as the flow of all kinds of monetary assets in the economy (broad sense of money). The correlation of money supply with growth has been quite contentious. We just lost a very good central bank governor in India because of these differences in opinion. The direction of causality is not so clear. However, many of the researches have had some empirical conclusions that suggest that GDP granger causes money supply and the vice versa is not true. In short term though, it appears that an increase in money supply leads to higher economic activity (can be easily checked through standard IS-LM or AD-AS models). The long term effects are not so clear. Having said that the answer to the question is yes, there can be growth even with a reducing or stable money supply. Such a situation would lead to deflationary pressures and possible increase in the velocity of money (faster transactions) in the economy. I don't have any concrete example of this case when money supply is steadily shrinking and economic activity is still healthy and growing. This could be because money supply is usually affected heavily by central bank's tools. And central banks usually would not do this. But there are examples when money supply has remained more or less stable. Such as, U.K in 2013-14 and India in 2015-16(June). In fact in India, money supply slightly decreased during this period while economy overall was in a healthy state. 

The throw-away paradox is a situation in which a trader can gain by throwing away some of his initial endowment. The specific example, brought by Aumann and Peleg in 1974, concerns an economy with two commodities and two traders: 

There is a quantification of this "utility monstrousness" in the fair division model. In that model, a resource has to be divided among $n$ partners, all of whom have the same rights to that resource but different preferences over parts of the resource. A division is called fair (according to one definition) if each person receives at least $1/n$ of the resource according to his own valuation (so there is no inter-personal utility comparisons). Here, too, there is a tradeoff between fairness and social welfare. It is quantified by the Price of Fairness concept. 

Here I am stuck. I don't understand why the utility function I suggested above doesn't work? And what axiom is violated here? 

Recently I conducted a small game among students of our institute. The game was based on Keynes' beauty contest game. The participants had to guess a number between 0 to 100 and the participant whose guess was closest to 2/3rd of the average of all guesses would win the game. The twist was this: We also awarded money to the winner in each round. The money was a multiple say, 5x of the final number (2/3rd of the average). What will be the Nash Equilibrium of this modified game. The solution to the original problem is of course everybody choosing 0. Will the equilibrium shift in the above described game. Consider n to be greater than 30. Any help would be appreciated. 

We need to understand the state of economy. When prices are rising rapidly we might be in the classical range of economy that is when a positive output gap exists. In such a situation, prices will change according to the higher interest rates (the supply curve will be vertical) and there will be a strong impact of monetary contraction or expansion on the prices and not on quantity as such. And if we are somewhere in the middle where we can safely say that the supply is influenced by price positively. In short run some price adjustment will take place. Firms will not reduce their capacity so swiftly in short run but reduce price instead. But yes the supply can really shift under if this persists. 

Consider a firm with zero marginal cost. If it gives the product for free, then all the demand is satisfied and the social welfare increases by the maximum possible amount; call this increase $W$. But because the firm is a monopoly, it reduces the demand and increases the price in order to optimize its revenue. Now the social welfare increases by a smaller amount, say, $V$. Define the relative loss of welfare (deadweight loss) as: $W/V$. This ratio depends on the shape of the demand function. So my question is: is this ratio bounded, or can it be arbitrarily large? In particular: 

An allocation is called Pareto-efficient if there is no other allocation of bundles to families such that all members of all families weakly prefer and at least one member of one family strictly prefers. Under what conditions does a Pareto-efficient envy-free allocation exist? If each family has a single member, then a Pareto-efficient envy-free allocation exists; this is a famous theorem of Varian. Has this theorem been generalized from individuals to families? 

It depends on what cost function the monopoly is facing. If the marginal cost function is not changing then there would be no change in pricing or quantity. 

In usual open market operations, the central bank will create money, use this money to buy short term treasury securities from maybe banks, individuals, institutions in the open market. This creates more demand for these securities and hence their price goes up and yield goes down. This newly generated money goes into the banking system. With more money, banks have more cash and have more reserves. With more reserves banks may be more willing to lend to each other and to individuals also. This lowers the short term inter banking interest rate. This way, there is more money in the system and there is a downward pressure on rates. With short term treasuries, central bank is less exposed to the interest rate risk. In quantitative easing(Q.E), both the purpose and the mechanism are different. First of all, Q.E usually will be performed in a situation which is not 'typical' money supply shortage or economic activity slowdown. This will either happen in a crisis sort of situation where aggressive boost is required or when central bank has run out of its primary weapons may be it has hit the zero bound of interest rates. The central bank in these situations might buy securities of different kinds which can be long term treasuries, private securities, securities in a particular area of market which the central bank thinks, needs to be revived. This certainly will increase money into the system but not just that but to further lower the yield and ease out specific markets such as mortgage based securities by reducing the risk spread. One other criterion is the size of the increase in balance sheet of central bank. In Q.E there is usually a much larger change in the balance sheet of central bank. Also, as there are different kinds of securities (including long term securities) in the assets of central bank which are not necessarily treasuries or highly rated securities, the central bank itself is exposed to more risk. Ben Bernanke said in 2009 that, the Q.E they exercised was not pure Q.E but credit easing because in pure Q.E, the central bank will not discriminate between what securities it is buying. However, according to him, Fed did target few specific markets. According to him, targeting few specific markets is more like credit easing and not pure Q.E. 

While reading economics papers, especially those related to economy with land, I often encounter the terms $L^\infty$ and the "weak* topology". They seem like very basic terms, but I couldn't find a basic explanation of them. Here is a typical paragraph which I am trying to decipher (it is from page 4 at the introduction of A foundation of location theory): 

Note: I asked this question on MathOverflow some time ago. Taneli Huuskonen came up with the negative example for weakly-quasiconcave function, but the question for strictly-quasiconcave function is still open. Due to the economic importance of quasiconcave functions, I thought someone here might have an answer. 

In the TR and ML cells, the sum of utilities of the row and column players is less than 2; hence, these cells are not played in equilibrium at all. So in equilibrium, the only cells that may be played with positive frequency are: TL, MR, BL, BR. Now, the authors claim that TL and MR are also not played at all in equilibrium. From this they conclude that the payoff of the dummy player is 0. I didn't understand this part. Is it true that TL and MR are never played in equilibrium? Why? 

Nash Equilibrium (N.E) is a general solution concept in Game Theory. N.E is a state of game when any player does not want to deviate from the strategy she is playing because she cannot do so profitably. So, no players wants to deviate from the strategy that they are playing given that others don't change their strategy. Thus, it is a mutually enforcing kind of strategy profile. 'Pareto optimality' is an efficiency concept. So no state will be Pareto Optimal if, at least one of the players can get more payoff without decreasing the payoff of any other player. There are many many examples of Nash Equilibria which are not pareto optimal. The most famous example could be the N.E in prisoner's dilemma. 

Commercial banks do a lot of lending and borrowing among each other and that is a sign of healthy flow of money in economy. This is because inter-bank activities ensure that enough credit is available and banks are engaging in lending to businesses, individuals etc. However, sometimes such lending is not what the central bank thinks it should be. Commercial banks may be cautious in lending to public or even to each other. This can happen when there are not enough investment opportunities according to them or because of low market sentiments. Banks at such times play safe and would rather park their money in their central bank accounts in the form of excess reserves. In such situations, when central bank reduces its rates there is less incentive for banks to park their money with it as their could be some other opportunities which could be more profitable. Secondly, the banks would have cheaper credit which can be used to finance their assets, to give loans and in case they face shortage of cash, central bank window is there to help them. Thus, reduction of rates by central bank can have many transmission mechanisms. However, there is absolutely no guarantee that such transmissions will happen. This depends on how the commercial banks receive this. How market reacts to this. Transmissions may take months or even years to complete. Within this period, the economy itself might grow or slow down and hence, the actual effect of these rate cuts or hikes could be just opposite to what the central bank intended. Hence, it's a tricky, inexact science and central banks have to work in a lot of uncertainty. 

I am stuck on the following exercise, related to preference relations and von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. 

Suppose the Net Domestic Product in a certain sector (e.g. agriculture) is 10 billion. Who enjoys this 10 billion? Initially, I thought that this 10 billion is the gross income of the farmers. So some of it is paid as taxes while the rest remains with the farmers as net income. But, I did the math with some real-life data, and found out that the net income of the farmers is much smaller. So, where does the difference go to? My conjecture is that the NDP include the income of other workers related to agriculture, e.g. truck drivers, traders and sellers in farmer markets. Is this correct? Or are they counted in a different sector? 

One such function is $$u(x,y)=\frac{1}{(x+ay)^{-3}+(ax+y)^{-3}}$$ But, in this example, the products are dependent. MY QUESTION IS: Is there an example of such a "throw away paradox", when the products are independent? NOTE: both products are goods (have non-negative utility). 

I would strongly recommend you to read Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew Mcafee et al for some serious and real insights about this topic. The world economic forum this year had the same theme. In my view (which are heavily derived from the works of the above mentioned dignitaries) the problems arising from complete automation will be the lowering or stagnation of income levels. As Erik mentions in his Ted talk, productivity levels are at all time high but income levels are not. This was not the case in previous technological revolutions. People and systems adapted to new technologies and income rose along with productivity. Now they don't share the same relationship. One of the reasons is that we are not changing our systems well to absorb the technology. For example, if people are saving a lot of time because of automation, they should be able to spend it in something constructive. May be entrepreneurship, maybe knowledge work. To make all those automation work, people are required to program, design, develop and create. There needs to be a shift from typical work to knowledge work. If such a shift is not there and that too at a speed that matches with the speed of technological changes then income levels will continue to fall, unemployment will rise. In Andrew Mcafee's words, "we need to RACE WITH THE MACHINE".
