Not some deep profound answer, but since this appears to be a recurring issue in your case, I'll just add an idea that worked in a university I'm affiliated with where they had a recurring issue with noise during examinations. One thing that can work, if there is a hallway outside the offices, is simply to put up a brightly coloured "Shhh... Please be quiet!" sign outside the office. Make sure it's very visible: one university I was at complained that even a sign in the middle of the corridor wasn't working, so they put up a red flashing bicycle light on top of the sign. They've rarely had problems since. Evidently, you should check for departmental permission before just putting up such a sign. However, if you can, it will have two major positive effects: 

Great question! Here are a few things I have learned both from personal experience and from talking with others. 1. Keep up with technology Don't get comfortable. Don't get complacent. Technology is always advancing. Don't wait for HTML6 to be the standard: jump on board ahead of time. Don't wait to catch up with technology, keep ahead of it and wait for it to catch up with you. If you don't have the freedom to do that at your job, do it at home. This will give you at least two advantages: 

Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.* Let's think through this question logically from start to finish. Basically, you have three options: 

I had a similar problem as well. In my case, the other employee's reason for opening the blinds was to get a bit more light in their corner, where light was somewhat insufficient. The solution for me was simple: I would close the blind as far as necessary to make me able to see the screen, but it was still open enough let some light through. The next step was obvious: go to management and ask for better lighting. The main point in this issue is understanding. They need to understand why you close the blind, but ideally, you should know why they open it, too. Presumably, they don't simply open it to spite you, though I suppose that's possible. Once you understand each others' motivations, you can work out a solution, and if necessary, request better lighting from management or even (very much dependent on work situation) switch work stations. 

He has no idea what a nuisance he has become to you, so any idea that involves bringing in HR or his manager is overkill at this stage. There is going to be nothing more effective than having a quick, non-confrontational chat with him to the tune of "Dude, you're driving me bonkers the way you pound your keyboard...Can we find a solution that works for the both of us?" Before you do this though, research some solutions you can propose, e.g. different keyboard, soft mousepads under the keyboard, etc. 

Since taking a job about year ago as a senior developer, I've seen my fair share of work that, let's just say, is less than stellar. The company is full of developers (for the sake of this question their name is "Joe") and Joe does things that do not follow proper procedures, break quite often and create lots of maintenance work to get running again. I'm usually the guy they go to to figure out the problem, and I can spend days trying to peel away their stupidity. Joe is not a direct report of my manager either, my manager understands my pain, but doesn't do much more than that. It's not that Joe is a bad employee, he works hard and is well respected in the company. He's just not up with the times with modern software development, and some of the key decisions he makes are making things more difficult for lots of people (not just me). I've also approached Joe before with an offer of, "Hey, have you ever seen this, you should check it out, I'll be happy to walk you through it". It was quickly rejected. I'm frustrated, because I know better ways to do these things, things that have a proven track record in my previous companies as working. I was hired to bring these ideas to my immediate group, but I'm finding my job stretches out to Joe's work as well often enough that I'm getting pretty fed up having to deal with his work. My question is, how open should I be about Joe concerning their shoddy work? Do I? 

This is a major issue in IT; we face it all the time. I would personally recommend several things. 1. Don't take your boss by surprise. In other words, don't just mention out of the blue, "Say, we need to upgrade our servers," or pop it on him while he happens to be walking through your section. Either write him a detailed e-mail (concise, mind you!), request a short meeting, or even write or print it up on paper. Your boss will take something more seriously if (s)he can see that you take it seriously. 2. Make comparison This is a key point that I have found quite effective. It works best in a real interview, which I try to steer something along these lines. 

I'm reading several different possibilities in your post. 1. Part-time education There are several types: 1. Continued education which is directly related to your job and could help you get a more highly paid position. 2. Continued education which is incidentally related to your job, and will only help you personally to do a better job, thus enabling you to become more useful to your employer and potentially gaining a raise. 3. Continued education which is unrelated to your job, and will only help you on a personal basis. I've kind of ruled this one out because you said "one can always learn more about their field." Whatever the case, I would encourage you to be open and honest about your education. Don't hide the fact that you're going for further education. On the other hand, don't go out of your way to tell your boss, your co-workers, etc. Tell them, but don't make a big point of making sure everyone knows. (Boss included) 2. Full-time education If you are quitting your job, regardless what you are planning on studying, definitely talk to your boss about it. Work out with him/her when you will be able to leave so that you have sufficient time to prepare for the entry to the scholastic year, but so that you can get done any projects that (s)he has for you to get done. 

You are on an uphill swim on this one. For six years, I worked remotely 2 days a week at a company that discouraged working from home except when it was needed. How? I negotiated this up front when I was hired and they were desperate, and later when they tried to take it away, I let them know (nicely) that I'd probably be looking for another job if they pulled back this benefit. They never questioned me again about it. Perhaps the same hard-nosed attitude will work in your case. I have since switched jobs, and I can say, it's so much nicer to work in a "work-from-home" culture, than going against the flow like the first job I talked about. 

You're putting the cart before the horse. I'm 20 years into a web development career now, and I came in my first position with no experience developing websites. Everything I learned, I learned because there was a business requirement, and I stepped up to meet that requirement using a technology I learned on the job. I commend you for getting some experience before you're hired, but know that employers are going to want to see real-world experience to really want to hire you. Saying you read a book, or played around with this technology doesn't go far. Even if you have to donate time, find someone, somewhere that you can help learn web development from. Are there charity organizations around you could help setup a simple site, for free. You're looking for experience, real experience. Get some real experience, then concentrate on getting your foot in the door for an entry-level position. Let your career grow and take off from there. 

Communicate with your superior. From what you're saying, it sounds like your responsibility is essentially to get the job done at the price and in the time that your superior expects. From what I'm reading, at any rate, it sounds like you're basically a facilitator between the superior and the subordinates to, as you said, keep them "on track." When something like this comes up, your superior has to know about it. He is the one whose pocket is going to be hit: essentially, it sounds like you are there to keep this kind of thing from happening. When you talk to him, you should clarify at least two things: 1. Is this person your subordinate? You mentioned that it wasn't official that you are really responsible for this person. If you aren't, this issue isn't in your department, and you can just alert your superior of it and pass on to other things. Whatever the case, there should be an official position on it. Request that it be made official if at all possible. 2. What should be done in this situation? Mention that this is an issue, and ask him / her what (s)he recommends you do in this situation. Should you work out a different way to work hours? Should you send an official warning that this behaviour is not acceptable? Should you leave it totally in the hands of your superior? 

...might do the trick. If, on the other hand, it's something that you deem important, or they feel they are rendering you a service by meeting with you, a similar, but slightly different tack might help: 

Suggest he take off his shoes. @DavidSchwartz's answer is excellent. If, however, he does not want to invest in anything, and your workplace is comfortable with this, he could simply take off his shoes. Very likely, he's building up static because either his chair or his shoes are not grounding as necessary to keep from building up static. I know it can sound very unprofessional in some domains - and it is - so I don't suggest it unless your workplace is very relaxed and is absolutely fine with him doing just that. For instance, if there are high profile clients going in and out of your office all the time, don't do it. But if you're a kind of back-end tech company who basically sits in a back room all day, this could be an option.
