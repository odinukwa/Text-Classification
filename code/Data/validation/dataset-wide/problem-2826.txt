Your concern is a common one, and a lot of newcomers to Stoicism report the same issue: they worry that their normal human motivational system is somehow being weakened or damaged by Stoic practice. People often encounter this problem when they focus exclusively on the "calm and de-stressing" elements of the philosophy, as you put it, but miss the Stoic call to value honorable behavior and to tirelessly pursue moral excellence at all costs. But on the other hand, more advanced Stoic practitioners sometimes report the opposite problem: ancient Stoicism's call to benefit others, to be politically engaged, to be a hard worker and an excellent provider for your family, etc., seems to demand so much focus, so much pro-social action, and so much diligent effort on their part that they fear it leads them to an unhealthy and unreasonable amount of "hurried energy to get things done." People encounter this problem when they (rightfully) interpret Stoicism as a radical system of virtue ethics, but leave its therapeutic elements underdeveloped and fail to recognize that self-care is also part of virtue ethics. 1. The Discipline of Action Stoicism is a Middle Way You phrased the question excellently: 

Passions: cognitive emotions that involve judging something outside your control to be "good" (or "bad"), in the sense that they are what make your life (not) worth living. Passions are categorized as desire, delight, fear, and distress. Proto-Passions: subconscious emotional reactions and reflexes, that arise directly from your impression of a situation. These include reactions to physical pain, and spontaneously crying at the death of a loved one. Healthy Passions: cognitive emotions that involve judging something within your control to be "good" (or "bad"). These are categorized as wishing, joy, or caution, and include things like gratitude, affection for people, and a desire to help them. 

Note: I'm treating virtue and ethics as synonyms here.... Is there a philosophy that counsels ethical behavior, even at personal expense? Many philosophies that stress altruism do this -- Stoicism, Buddhism and Cynicism come to mind. Specifically, Buddhism has the concept of the Bodhisattva. Are moral duty and happiness incompatible? Not necessarily. If one's moral duty is a condition for one's happiness, then they are compatible. This isn't a vacuous reduction; this is Stoicism's strategy. Here is a quote from the IEP: 

As much as I love Ken Wilber's "No Boundary" and his general project, I take his views as more of an attempt to unify and modernize the "perennial philosophy", rather than anything having to do with the realm usually covered by science. As such, these two areas should not be compared. Our techno/social level has improved from better information transmission and preservation (language, writing, global communication, etc...) and not biology. This has allowed us to better build on what went on before and hence move forward. I think all people are biologically capable of the same intelligence, but since advancement is a social phenomena, we should look at it from the cultural level. Some cultures may encourage or discourage this transmission and thus their progress may be affected accordingly. How did these different cultures arise if not due to differences in biology? Environment! At this point, I'd recommend Jared Diamond's book Guns Germs and Steel. If nothing else, it can help build an appreciation of the interdependence between "progress" and the environment. Having said that, if one holds that evolution is any process in which replication success is driven by change and a selection pressure, then one could look at successful societies or ideas from an evolutionary perspective. What ideas or social structures spread? Which ones die out? Why? You needn't look further than the state of the world and many indigenous cultures to see this in action. In this sense, yes, we've evolved and will continue to do so. However, it's important not to make the mistake of assuming evolution means we're getting better, or heading towards some pre-defined state. If we turn into a "degenerate culture", that is as much evolution as if we turn into an "enlightened" one. Also, if you turn this idea on its head and look at concepts as the central players (rather than people or social groups), you'll get The Meme. 

The Stoic call to action and kindness is famously illustrated by the Circles of Hierocles. We are taught to imagine ourselves at the center of a sphere of humanity, pulling everyone closer and closer to us, until we care about their needs the same as our own: 

You've hit the nail on the head! What psychologists call approach-oriented and avoidance-oriented emotions are a fundamental part of our motivational machinery. Getting rid of them entirely seems like a pretty bad idea! As we've seen, the Stoics do think that our actions are within our power, and that virtuous action is important. Rationally, then, having Stoic beliefs shouldn't lead you to be less active (quite the opposite). But what about emotionally? Emotions help us remember things, they help us focus on what's important, and they give us that extra "tension" (as the Stoics called it) or "push" that helps us perform well. The Stoics agreed! While they are famous for rejecting quote-unquote "emotions," in reality they divided emotions into three categories, and they only rejected one of them. 

The truth is that Stoicism was never supposed to be a purely detached way of life. Zeno introduced Stoic ethics explicitly as a middle way between the detached extreme of the Cynics (who withdrew from society) and the worldly extreme of the Cyrenaics (who sought to maximize pleasurable indulgences). Virtue Leads to Action 

Because they place virtue at the core of their theory of human worth, the Stoic view of human happiness is an extremely active one. Listen to how Seneca puts it in his book On Leisure (1.4): 

This is basically a teleportation thought experiment, used to explore personal identity. Derek Parfitt in particular, has used this (among other experiments), and I highly recommend reading his work. Whether this transports one's sense of self depends on the relationship between consciousness & matter and on the nature of the self. Is consciousness a function of matter? If so, just what kind of function of matter is it? For that matter, how do you know that you even have a stable sense of self? Maybe you die regularly and are replaced by a clone who has your memories? If so, you are one of those clones and your personal continuity is just an "inherited" memory. If this is so, then teleporter dilemma isn't one, as it would simply do what nature is doing to you all the time. 

There are multiple truths. There's the truth that there is a head on my neck, that there is a shoe on my foot, and so on. If this strikes you as vacuous, then the natural question is this: 

How are generalizations created, justified and accepted? Often, it's what benefits mathematical practice. For instance, unifying fields of study and discovering interesting results are considered beneficial, and this desire can drive a lot of the attempt to find generalizations, and can be used as a criteria to justify and accept these generalizations. Could we have chosen different generalizations (I'm suggesting that we could). Yes. Is every generalization a creation of another axiom? No. Some generalizations simply discover new results, others are isomorphisms among pre-existing fields, still others could be different formalisms. Is there the only, ultimate, correct and valid generalization? If you're a Platonist, perhaps, but personally I think not. Even finding the one generalization that unifies all others may not qualify as some generalizations facilitate certain practices at the expense of others. Since different mathematics have different goals, it stands to reason that different generalizations will be adopted as the needs dictate. 

The Outcome is Neither Good nor Bad, but the Attempt is! It's true, though, that in Stoic theory, it is said that external things are "neither good nor bad." We are taught to value what is within our control, and not to view things like professional success, wealth, or fame as being important to our capital-H Happiness. But the attempt to pursue certain outcomes in absolutely within our control! The Stoics said that external things have a kind of "selective value" (depending on the situation), and that we cannot be virtuous if we do not exert ourselves in pursue of valuable outcomes (namely outcomes that benefit humanity). They were quite serious about this point! In Cicero's De Finibus, we learn that the Stoics thought that people who treated external things as wholly indifferent and rejected even their selective value (namely the Cynics and Aristo of Chios) had destroyed the foundation of virtue. Action matters! Cicero also gives us the famous metaphor of the Stoic Archer: the Archer's goal, he says, is to perform her art well. She shoots at many external targets (which have selective value), but her ultimate goal is simply to do her best. Other Stoics texts make similar analogies to Olympic athletes, pilots of ships, musical performers, and ball players. 

3. Passions are Morally Problematic All this said, the Stoics do suggest that you may sometimes have to give up a competitive advantage in order to follow their way of life. In Seneca's famous essay On Anger, for instance, he cedes that anger may indeed sometimes be "useful." But not only is it a dangerous ally (anger, he emphasizes, is extremely difficult to control), but anger is fundamentally immoral: in Greek philosophy, anger is defined as a desire to get revenge for a perceived wrong. The Stoics didn't believe in vengeance. They believed that our response to conflict should be forward-looking: we can act to protect people, or to try and rehabilitate a criminal, but (following Socrates) we should always view even the worst of human beings as being infected by ignorance, the way a patient is infected by a disease. The passion of anger (as opposed to its related proto-passions or healthy passions), for the Stoics, is fundamentally vicious. Since the whole point of their philosophy is that we should never, ever, trade virtue for vice, they are more than happy to sacrifice whatever utility anger offers in order to maintain their progress toward good moral character. The same argument applies to every other emotion that the Stoics condemn. Passions are to be avoided, not just because they are unpleasant, but because by definition they involve a judgement that some external thing is valuable in the same way that virtue is valuable. And that, for the Stoics, is a dangerous idea: once we admit that moral character may not be the highest good—that there might be something of equal value to it—then we open a slippery slope toward rationalizing away our duties and commitments. 

What qualifies humans for rights? The arguments I've seen include rationality and sentience, so let's look at those. Rationality doesn't hold up as even the severely mentally impaired have rights. While their rights may seem curtailed (such as them being institutionalized), those are considered measures for their own protection. Sentience is questionable. Those who are comatose or brain-dead are arguably not sentient, yet there is intense debate about pulling the plug on them. Do these arguments stem from the possibility that they are sentient or may regain sentience? Admittedly, the debate gets less intense if it's agreed that they will never recover, but it still goes on. What if our capacity to feel pain or pleasure contributes to our rights? In this view, we could argue that our rationality increases our ability to feel both and thus qualifies us for more rights. For instance, we have plans, goals, ideals and dreams that make things like imprisonment painful, even if we were imprisoned in comfort. Thus caging a human qualitatively differs from caging a lion. Those are among the questions that need to be answered. However, is this how we decide on rights? Or do we simply give rights to biological humans and then use post hoc reasoning to justify our decision? To give this answer a further philosophical wrinkle... if we use a pain/pleasure requirement for rights, then this fits a Consequentialist Philosophy of ethics, such as Utilitarianism. Utilitarians focus on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain so their decision would hinge on the AI's capability to experience these. Sentience does not imply affect, so if an AI can't feel either, then it needs no rights for it cannot suffer from their lack and vice versa.
