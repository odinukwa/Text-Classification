Unless we have a huge leap in technology and computers work entirely different from current ones (e.g. quantum computers) there won't be anything different about teaching that. But if there is such a change (which is likely, to a degree) we can not predict what will have to be taught then. fact is, the basics of logic and simple processor will most likely still be relevant to the curriculum. 

If the risk of dying ingame is not as high as in Dark Souls and not loads of people you knew would die everyday, people would play it. Why wouldn't they? If the chance of dying is lower than the chance of dying from lung cancer from smoking for 20 years people will definitely do it, especially if it is not always the case you die in real life when you die ingame. People will think "It won't hit me." as they do with cigarettes. To summarize with everything other people said: 

I think it would not change much in modern warfare, as the current trend is less based on infantry combat. They would improve the existent uses of shields in military and police activity, but not change the tactics, as most tactics involve long distance, high-tech (drones), or explosive power. So it would just be used in the same scenarios shields are already used. The material on the other hand could be used for many different things. Even if you can't forge precise forms you can enhance vehicle plating, body armour in smaller pieces to stop bullets. But except for guerilla fights tower shields will not have an impact. And there it is only changing effectiveness and not tactics. (Modern shields are already almost impenetrable, after all) 

Selective Breeding is your solution If you make the society in a way that they value one specific attribute much more than anything else than you can force breeding in the same way we do with animals. When only people with incredibly great eye sight are allowed to breed we'll have great improvements in the matter of a few generations. If we were to continue something like this over the period of a hundred generations we'd end up with a population of people with great eye sight, but all the other stuff regarding health, strength, etc. was not part of the selective pressure (besides that the minimum of a ability to survive has to be given). Therefore all the other traits might have been weakened over the generations. You would need a strict enforcement of this by society, though. Humans tend to breed with whomever they want (with the built-in biological criteria of attractiveness). You would need to override these "normal" behaviours and force humans to be very selectively breeding with the desired criteria. Natural Selection The only reason why something like this would occur naturally if your enviroment would be pushing very strong selective pressures on your population. If you have a constant level of toxic stuff in your air or in your food you would have a high selective pressure on people's ability to sustain their bodies despite the toxins. This would result in the specific attacked becoming very resistent to toxins and/or your liver very good at filtering toxins out of your body. 

TL;DR: I think it's not likely to work with radar, but sonar could be possible The reason why radar works is reflection of electromagnetic waves on most metallic surfaces. If you don't have this strong reflection effect you can't measure where things are and your send waves just pass through the material or are absorbed by it. Organic material is a lot different from metals. Biological bodies barely have any reflection in most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. And there certainly is not that one thing you can detect any biological entity in air and in water with the same wavelength. Most likely you couldn't even use several different wavelengths, because the reflection is so weak you can not detect anything. What might work is sonar, because the properties regarding acoustic waves in biological entities are vastly different from the surrounding medium (air or water). Reflection might be possible to use find most biological organism. Bats use a sonar system to find things in air and things like whales can be seen on sonar systems on boats. So i do think it is possible to detect most biological entities of sufficient size. (Jellyfish might be difficult, since they are thin and mostly consist of water, if i am correct) EDIT: I just read that the maximum range of ultrasound in air is approximately 200 meters. If this is sufficient for you purposes sonar could work. 

Your question regarding the computer answers itself. Joe1 can not be transferred into a computer. Joe1 is a biological machine and his mind would have to be translated for a computer existence. How do you imagine this transfer with the "real" Joe1 to look like? Like him disintegrating and being sucked into the computer? The body would still die. If you want to transfer him into a new plain of existence his body (and brain) would still be left here. And probably die. Regarding the teleportation it's more to do with physics than anything. At this current time we know of nothing that could transport matter over long distances without ever making it "move". Current Theories suggest that things like wormholes are impossible and nothing in the universe can just "jump" from one position to the other. With the Transfer to a different body or a robotic body it's different. Theoretically you could just move a person's brain, hook it up into (biological) machinery, supply it and it can learn to interact with it's new surroundings. Example: There are robotics projects of (paraplegic) people getting neural implants with wires to a robotic arm which they can then learn to control. So it's not a big stretch of the imagination that you could do this with more than just one arm. On the other hand, transplanting any organ into a different body might always end with the new body rejecting the organ. So that might go wrong in a brain transplant. 

Well, the eye would have to be structured very differently. Our eyes have a single lense to focus incoming light. But to have an enhancing effect you need several lenses with some distance between them. The ability to "zoom" would require these lenses to be mobile and/or change their dioptre value to still enable the image to be sharp. That's a pretty elaborate mechanism that could not easily just come to happen. So no, i do not think it is possible, and if it is, highly unlikely. 

I think it would work once you got it rotating. The difficult part is probably the shaft, as it would need to be strong and sturdy enough to handle the acceleration with two significantly heavier masses at the ends. It probably depends a lot on the material, diameter and shaft lenght, but i'm quite sure there would be a workable combination. I am not sure about the maneuverability of a structure like this. If you just want to fly a straight line it might work, if you want to do complex maneuvers you're probably bad off with this. 

Time dilation comes from gravity and/or velocity. Since the planet is not orbiting a black hole it would either have to orbit another super heavy mass or fly through space with a lorentz factor of 0.5 (when seen from earth) as that would equal time dilation of a factor 2. $t_{planet} = \gamma * t_{earth};$ with $\gamma$ being the lorentz factor of $\gamma = \sqrt{1-(v/c)Â²}$ with $\gamma = 0.5$ the velocity is $v = 0.866 * c$ This means your planet would have to travel with 86.6% times the speed of light. EDIT: as Raditz_35 pointed out 

As somebody who studies electrical engineering with a focus on hardware development i can tell you that in this specific field of computer architecture software and hardware development are closely intertwined. Of course there is the high-end hardware people who do nothing but that and the high-end software people who don't know what their hardware looks like, but there is a whole field of study between them. Computer architecture is a very important field that will not die out just because most people have to do with software. You can simply not have a world that is so incredibly high-tech if there is no one there who can build the technology that world requires. You don't even need that many people for something like that. If you compare the amount of people who know how to code software with the amount of people who can design hardware there is already a ratio of 100 to 1 if not less. Computer architecture won't die out in a world like this. Just like physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering and medicine will not die out. It will still be tought the way it is now. Regarding how it will be taught: 

You are kind of answering your own question. Human labor is the only possibility you did not exclude by your world setting. Historically we have been using either machines, animals or manual labor to accomplish tasks like these. Since it's medieval times machinery is off the table. Animals are off the table too, because of your world design. So there is just human labor left. (This could be slaves for example.)
