Cultural reasons are all well and good, but feels like a handwave. Behavior is more believable when it has a practical, comprehensible rationale behind it. Reasons we do it in human society: 

This is often handled by having the inheritance be a thing that's handed down - the one who holds the golden key that has in its handle the scroll with the ritual written on it, or whatever. Then it doesn't really matter about who inherits what, and whether the firstborn's firstborn survived to have descendants, and so on, because that's already all handled by lawyers who have experience in that stuff, and the golden key will get into the right hands, or at least the best-appointed ones. === Birthmarks or other physical traits are similar, though perhaps a little hokey. But assuming they're genetic, but can skip generations, and members, you can have a reasonably small population affected. Particularly if you only get the mark if you have two copies of the gene, so only people in a fairly small community will get it - or people who are the result of incest. So you'd have the whole tribe of people with the trait wiped out, only for the trait to arise in a single unrelated person many years later. $URL$ can be caused by a genetic trait that works this way; it causes children to be born apparently female, but become male when they reach puberty. There was a case in London where a young lady discovered she had this condition only on her wedding night! She had no connection to existing known populations with this trait, but on investigation it was discovered that her mother was also her sister, which granted her two copies of the gene, from her father/grandfather. 

You can't be building a world like this, without intending to draw parallels against our own world. And our own world is not fair. If you are aiming for fairness, you are worldbuilding a world of tedium and boringness. In the real world, whatever system you find to allocate fairness will be found unfair by some. 

As someone who's worked as a lumberjack, I'm quite surprised at the answers here: I think everyone is imagining one-on-one duels between people dressed in plate armor, for which, admittedly, they might be poor because of their weight, one-handed balance, inability to parry well and inability to slice through metal. But given to your front line, against a force who lacked them, it would be devastating. Chainsaws are deadly. They are the most deadly tool you can use without a license. They wound about thirty thousand people a year in the US alone. The wounds take an average of a hundred and ten stitches. That's when not trying to cut people up with it. About two hundred and fifty people a year die from them. Consider two spear-and-pole-wielding lines meeting, but one is equipped with spears, the other pole-saws. The spears get mostly deflected by the shields. The pole-saws slice right through all the leather armor and felt padding and wooden shields and other nonsense. They meet a surface they can't penetrate, the pole saws actively grab onto it, pull it to one side, and crawl around it. Yes, you'd need a secondary weapon. But the majority of the foe's front line now needs an average of 110 stitches. You've struck terror into their hearts and nobody wants to step up to the meatgrinding machine that is your front line. Chainsaws are an excellent tool, then, for massacres of lightly armored foes by a heavily organized force. But they come with a downside: they are the most deadly tool you can use without a license, because they mostly maim the user. The whole "moving of their own accord to find they way past any impenetrable armor" thing can work against you, too: they kick back, they leap up into your face and neck, or down into your own leg. Pole saws are safer, but only to an extent. Perhaps the most effective way to use them, then, would be using a formation like the Roman turtle, but with either pole saws, or a flap in the shield to push a chainsaw through, clamped in place such that the chainsaw cannot buck and twist in the hands of the wielder enough to slice himself or his comrades, and the wielder can use both hands to steady it and the shield together. Combat is an arms race, though. Just as loggers now wear fibrous trousers to prevent injury from chainsaws, so people would start to wear heavy fibrous clothing to tangle the saws, and they would also clad their shields in it. But arms races only have so much speed. The initial introduction of them could be enough to win a war. [Edit: From pluckedKiwi's comments, I realize that polesaws are not known to everyone. A polesaw is a chainsaw with a pole between the engine and the blade, rather than placing a regular chainsaw on the end of a stick. This gives you balance: the weight of the engine and fuel tank (or motor and battery) near and behind your hand, counterbalances the length of the shaft and the weight of the blade at the end, arguably balancing better than a spear. However, it's still a decently heavy piece of kit. I still think regular chainsaws mounted behind shields in turtle formation would be the best plan to use them. However, the lack of range compared to any missile weapon of the same size and weight does make them kinda silly. Combat modifications to the blade (larger teeth; separating each tooth by two or three empty links as is used when cutting stone; faster chain replacement with a sprung blade instead of bolt tightening) would certainly help. As would ablative armor for the wielders to protect them from kickback. If the question were "what modern stuff other than guns could make a medieval army really fricken deadly" I might not even bother mentioning chainsaws. Better armor would get my first vote. But given the question, yes, chainsaws would give your front line a crushing advantage. Rather than just being a consumable, disposable mass of bodies to absorb (or make) a waved attack, they'd be a death machine, grinding through flesh with a speed the opponents had never imagined. Sure, any missile weapon beats them. One gatling gun could best your entire army of chainsaw wielders. So would a line of bowmen with longbows. But in medieval days, the tank of the day was the armored horse. A charge of trained horse-riding knights who've been trained their whole life, against a chainsaw turtle with a month's training... despite the very significant problems of armor penetration, particularly as the science of making plate armor got better, my money's on the turtle.] 

Inside flight implies that the smog idea either won't work, or will require flying by instrument. Shouldn't be a problem at this level of tech. Also requires friend-of-foe identification, again not an issue. All these layers of protection would give you a super-well-defended city, but I suspect would be too much of an urban redesign. But some of them might be usable to beef up the defenses you take from other ideas, at least. 

Turns out there's another, equally-well-researched, legit reason for this, in actual real life, here on earth. In sports, statistically, if one team wears red, they do better. National Geographic's article on this. reports researchers saying "Where there was a small point difference, the effect of color was sufficient to tip the balance." - it goes on to state that the preponderance of red wins was great enough that it could not be attributed to chance, and shows that the effect has been measured in other species (mandrils, zebra finches), not just humans... so why not aliens too? Scientific American's article on this. states that red-wearing athletes won 60% of the time in balanced matches; blue-wearing ones won only 40% - that's a 20% difference! [edit: 10% change, 20% gap... but 50% difference!] They also note that this affects teams, as well as individuals. Sure, that extra confidence and energy and perceived aggressive dominance by one's opponents can lead to death. Also, being highly visible can be a problem. But why would one throw away a clear 50% strategic superiority and psychological edge that the color gives us? The mission is the important thing. Lives hang in the balance. Even fractions of a percentage point of advantage could save the lives of the crew, or even the C.A.S.T.! 

Don't start from mammals or chordates, because that implies late panspermia. Instead, build a world (this is Worldbuilding, after all!) Have all major animals on this world have four eyes. Quadrilateral symmetry would make this more likely, but "quadrilateral symmetry" is a slippery fish. You could have the symmetry last only for a time as they develop in the womb, as ours does: even mammals are arguably, at some very low level, quadrilaterally symmetric - two limbs above, and two below. So if their symmetry lasted just a little longer, such animals could evolve into bipeds with manipulative arms, or animals designed to move quickly in one direction (our quadrupeds), and so on, but that their design is more quadrilaterally symmetric could inform your design of them, beyond the fact that four eyes was the typical pattern. Prey animals would naturally tend to have the four eyes at four corners around their head, rather than paired. This would grant them stereo vision for 360 degrees. They wouldn't have to make the tradeoff that earth prey make, trading binocular sight for angular resolution. The rear eyes might migrate out on stalks/horns, the better to see around the body as they eat. Predator animals would tend to have the rear eyes migrate forwards, up over the head or around the sides, granting them better peripheral vision for hunting, and perhaps being co-opted for other uses that the main eyes did not fill. Extended out on stalks to help with cooling, the extra eyes could be sensitive into the infra-red range. Scavengers, opportunist feeders, would tend to vary between the two, and a state where the eyes were arranged in two pairs, front and back, could make a lot of sense, since it would still give about 360 vision, but binocular only "ahead" and "behind", which requires a whole lot less processing, allowing other parts of the brain to develop more, instead. For bipeds, the ahead/behind distinction might not make much sense: they might have one direction in which they can move more rapidly, but if they can look in both directions, it's likely that their arms would be arranged such that they could manipulate items on either face of their body with roughly equal facility. Perhaps one side would be more capable at fine work, and one more capable of hard physical work and fast movement. Perhaps one set of eyes would naturally lean towards long-sightedness, and one to short-sightedness. Perhaps, like left/right handedness, they could be dorsal/ventral-favored, favoring one or the face (which could lead to various social complexities, biases, genders, etc). Perhaps they would have a subtly different concept of left/right than we do ("on the left as you walk down the road" is unambiguous; "your left arm" is ambiguous to something facing in both directions). 

Plenty of examples have been given, including the ones I could come up with (Japanese, braille, runic). But few have addressed (beyond a simple yes/no) the worldbuilding aspect of this - "is it possible?" (which, in worldbuilding sense, usually means "is this the kind of thing that would make a reader whimper at the straining of their suspension of their disbelief?") I think a class divide is certainly one possible way this could happen, but it need not be higher/lower classes. There could also, as a historically supported example, be religious vs lay writings. The cloistered religious sects develop separately from the common world, so can and have either developed entirely separate writing styles, and even languages; or preserved older ones while the rest of the world moved on. But in the future, perhaps the most obvious division would be a technocracy, with a writing system optimized for computer-based I/O. Consider, for example, chord-keying. If you teach kids chord-keying input from the get-go, it's silly to teach the letters, then the chord-pattern, then require them to mentally map from one to t'other. So you might only teach - at least initially - the list of which combination of the five keys is depressed for each letter/phoneme. Each letter could be represented, then, by a 5-pointed star with some of the points missing. Realistically, though, to prevent linguistic drift, they would need to share a common sent of spoken media (movies, plays, songs, etc), but their written materials would either be unshared, or so trivially translated between encodings when passing between the groups that nobody ever thinks about it. The latter is the most likely, and also a bit of a problem from a narrative standpoint. If the representations are just different fonts for the same codepoints, what's to stop someone just changing fonts in order to read most things. Augmented reality apps to translate roadsigns would also prevent confusion. So, while it's possible that such a divided culture could form, it's not really possible, in a high-tech culture, for a non-shared font to cause any significant division. Illiteracy is a much more believable thing; a subculture (perhaps a technocracy) which has moved past using the written word, would do it.
