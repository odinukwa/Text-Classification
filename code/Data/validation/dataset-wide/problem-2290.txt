As long as you have checked such stuff, you should be quite safe with flowing water in mountain areas. Even the streams of melting water that build up on the surface of glaciers on summer afternoons will be rather fine then. 

The guide's argument seems to be reasonable. However, I would not recommend to simply copy that behaviour but try to go with the more conservative advice you were given. The guide has one big advantage compared to you: He is roaming this area all the time – if he is a local guide, if not he has at least lots of experience with mountainous areas in general – so he knows very well about local weather phenomena (see also Do Mountains really make their own weather and if so why?). With this knowledge monitoring the air pressure can be a good means to see whether it is still safe to go or if turning back is better. However, as already said, I would not recommend to do so yourself and stick to a more conservative approach instead. 

According to this German blog post either duct tape, the Tenacious Tape mentioned by Greg Hewgill in his answer or – and I was a bit surprised about that – also bicycle tube patches should be OK for an on-trail repair. However, the post also argues that normally these do neither look very nice nor are they very durable. Instead, they suggest to get the hole fixed either by the manufacturer of the respective gear or some professional repair service for down gear as soon as you get home again. 

The "X chamber" construction is the most simple way to enclose the filling into chambers: the inner and outer fabric are just quilted together, forming tubular chambers that are filled with loft material, as it is known from most down jackets. It is often also named "sewn-through", e.g. in this article. In contrary the other chamber constructions are built in a way that the chambers have some overlap of loft material to prevent thermal bridges. This does also mean that inner and outer fabric do not share common seams. The drawback of the "X" construction compared to the other construction types ("H", "V" etc.) is that the sleeping bag has no insulating material at the seams which reduces the thermal insulation. The advantage is that it is lighter than the other constructions as there is no additional fabric needed besides the inner and outer shells to form three dimensional chambers. This is OK for sleeping bags for not too cold temperatures but is not so good when going to lower temperatures where there would be significant heat loss through these uninsulated seams. 

*Some of those measures may be not of relevance for you or just some kind of voodoo that has no real justification but gives you a good feel and the manufacturer a higher price, but that's not the point here. 

Possibly they did wear those lamps just for the documentary to give it some nostalgic touch, but there are situations where such lamps are at least not worse than battery powered ones. 

This answer is not exclusive to archery but concerns basically any activity where there are certain implicit rules that are widely agreed on in the community and are written down explicitly for competitions. Since you say that it was during a tournament and covered by the rules, then it's easy. You can refer to the rules which should also state what is the penalty in such a case. If it seems to be someone who is new to the sport, it might be fair to tell them that measuring distances is not allowed by the rules and if they should repeat that behaviour – now that they know about it – you would have to raise this violation to the tournament organizers, referees or whatever entity is taking care of the rules. In a context where there are no written rules, there can't be a rule violation, only things that "you don't do as a (insert performer of random activity here)". So, if the behaviour in question occurs in a random occasion it depends on how much this influences your own performance and how well-meaning you are towards that person. If their behaviour doesn't directly influence you and you don't really care about that person and their reputation, you could just let it go. If there are no written rules, there is no real cheating, only bad style. If you don't care about the style and reputation of this other person, ignore it and make a note to yourself that you don't take their results too serious. In the case that you either care about that person's reputation and/or it influences your own performance (you get distracted by their laser spot on a target, by seeing them point with a strangely looking device at something or whatever), then take them aside and inform them that the way they are doing this is not the way it is normally thought to be done and that it disturbs the people around them and/or might be bad for their reputation. 

*Obviously there are significant deviations and measurement precision problems among different testing labs which seems to spoil this comparability, as can be read from this report some major manufacturers commissioned. 

The only option I couldn't was the question for a restaurant in the middle, however, if you narrow the choice down to some routes you might get away with reading their descriptions and looking into the map to see whether there is such a spot. Planning own routes For planing own routes you can consider $URL$ They have a route editor where you can define a start and end point (and some points in between, if you like) and it will propose a route between those points that tries to keep away from big streets and prefers official hiking routes. Here you can also give some rough characteristics to search for, i.e. if you want it as flat as possible (and accept a longer route instead) or don't have a problem with some more ups and downs for the sake of a shorter distance. Although you cannot explicitly ask for a round trip of a certain length, you can do this basically "by hand" by roughly defining some route points where start end end point are at the same spot and that are as the crow flies somewhat (10 to 20%) shorter than the desired route. The route that the engine proposes should then be roughly the distance you wanted. If not, then you can still nudge some of your way points around a bit to get a better fit. 

In this article in the bergundsteigen journal (unfortunately in German) the authors, one of whom is a known Swiss expert in the development of avalanche rescue systems and techniques, did a review of a bunch of avalanche shovels. As they do not cite any norms that these shovels must comply to but comment that some manufacturers seemingly don't even test their products under realistic conditions, I guess there is no such norm. Background of this review was that during a test of shoveling strategies for avalanche rescue (same source, also German) they encountered several shovels that broke during the test after only rather moderate use time. Hence they obtained some shovels from various manufacturers to test them in practice. The (at least to me) surprising outcome was, that more than half of the tested 11 products were more or less only suited for one-time use, i.e. they developed serious signs of wear during use – cracks in the blade, bent shafts and the like which would not qualify the shovel for further use. One product failed so much that they qualified it as unsuitable. Despite some ergonomic considerations they stress the importance of one key fact: durable models were all made of 6061 aluminum with T6 temperature hardening. Only if those two properties are explicitly specified (not just something generic like "special hardened aluminum") one can expect a shovel that lasts for more than just one or two employments. 

First of all I have to admit that the following is mostly not based on knowledge but more or less on educated guessing, so take it with a grain of salt. Alpine tours Let's first consider hiring a guide in the Alps (maximum height below 5000m). Here the answer, if you will be asked for a tour book should be in nearly all cases "No". Here we can just divide the tours into two categories, based on how risky they are for the guide. In the "easy" category we can put all tours where the guide could easily go alone as well and just has to take additional care to guarantee for the safety of their guest. The normal routes onto most four-thousander peaks in the Alps will be in this category for example. Here a guide will quite surely not ask for a tour book as they will able to bring you there as long as you are physically and mentally fit enough, as the guide will be able to handle all the technical stuff. The "hard" category are routes that put also the guide at significant risk and where the guest is not only a passive factor in the safety consideration but has to actively perform tasks such as belaying. Here the guide might ask for a tour book but will ask at least, what you have done before to get an estimation what you are able to do. In this class you surely also won't do a "let's meet in the morning and rush up that dangerous route" like tour, unless you have been on tour with this guide before. So typically you will be together with that guide over several days and do some easier tours before for acclimatisation and to get to know each other. For all alpine tours there is also one big advantage: You are not far from civilization and there's not much planning and organization required in advance. Typically you also are on tour in small groups of maybe a maximum of five people or so. Therefore, if your guide sees that you are not well enough prepared for the tour, you can just cancel and return to base without greater financial or organizational costs. Expeditions For expeditions, things are bit different as there has to be lot of organization beforehand: flights and transportation have to be booked, a time schedule for the approach to the target mountains is made and there are a lot of people involved. In this case, a single person that is unable to cope with the requirements might make the whole expedition fail. You cannot just turn around and walk back to the airport if you are on tour with a 20 person expedition in a remote area. In this case, the guides in charge will surely want to know if the people they are taking with them will be most likely be able to meet all the requirements for the tour. I know of at least one case, where the guide in charge of a commercial Mount Everest expedition cancelled the whole expedition as he recognized that none of the participants had ever been above 8000m before. How and what to write into a tour book? I surfed the websites and catalogs of some expedition organizers but none of them gave some explicit information on what they expect from a tour book. However, I would not spend too much thoughts on that problem as the organizers cannot expect that someone will write such a book just to comply with the requirements of a expedition organizer. So I would just keep some kind of "log" of my activities. Things I would note are: 

Ice screws have a tendency for pressure melting if constantly loaded over some time. Therefore if you build your fixed point belay system and and keep it under more or less constant load while belaying your partner, the screw might start to migrate as the ice below it melts slowly and refreezes above the screw. By this, a screw that was close to bomb-proof when you installed it might lose some of its strength over time. If you build now a belay on two equalised screws, both get loaded and therefore both are affected by pressure melting, which means your whole anchor system might fail in case of a fall. This can to some point be avoided by building your belay point in a way that only one screw is loaded while having a second one for backup that will only get loaded if the first one fails. Of course, one has to take care that the other points of the SERENE or EARNEST scheme are fulfilled – even more in this case. That means especially, that you have to ensure not to shock load the backup screw. Therefore take care that the backup screw is preferably in direct line with the expected load direction behind the loaded one and that they are connected without any slack webbing. 

There can't be any general rule on testing equipment but you should have tested at least all the features that you think you will need during your journey. You also do not necessarily have to test all your stuff at once. For "technical" equipment such as tents, stoves and the like, it might be enough to just learn their handling. Nothing is more annoying than arriving at your camping spot all tired and pulling out your tent for the very first time ever, reading the manual and finding out, that the pegs are not suitable for the kind of ground you're on. As Aravona already mentioned in a comment, testing your stove might be easily done by cooking some dinner on it at home. But you also might want so test it somewhere outside when it's a bit windy to see how it handles in windy conditions. The same with a tent for example: just pitch it somewhere in your garden (or a public park, if you don't have a garden). With clothing, it's a bit more complicated. Finding out if your new rain jacket can cope with a whole day of heavy rain without soaking through requires to get out for a day in heavy rain... Same for other stuff you want to rely on in uncomfortable situations – you get the idea. Last but not least, also do a packing check where you fit all your stuff into your backpack some days before you finally pack all your stuff for the journey. If you find out then, that you have too much things to ever fit into your pack, you have still some time left to think about what is not urgently necessary or save to leave at home.
