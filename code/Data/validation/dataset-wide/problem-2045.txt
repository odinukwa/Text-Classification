Don't ask. You may feel like a slacker now, but what often happens is as soon as you ask for work outside of your department, your own department fills up with work, and you're stuck with having to keep all those promises. You'll also open yourself up down the road as an "extra" resource for those departments, and again, you'll have trouble saying no. Improve your communication. Tell the people running the projects that you are entering time but have done no concrete tasks. If they don't respond then that is their issue. Work on things that will improve your skills, things that the company will benefit from in the long run. Document what you work on. 

Rules of the employer are not your problem -- they may control internally how much the company offers, but do not control how much you can ask for. You need to give them a number that you will accept if offered -- you should also discuss that number with your spouse. If your spouse recommends a number lower than you are willing to accept (which could mean money means more than your career satisfaction), that raises a larger set of issues that are way off topic for this site. Remember to think about the worst-case scenario, and ask yourself, if I was being paid X, could I really deal with this day to day? If there is no such amount, the best thing to do would be to walk away. 

The proper way of handling this situation is to leave it alone. The company you interviewed with likely understands the importance of confidentiality in these matters. In the unlikely event that your interview is mentioned, you have a great response -- the other company made a great offer but you decided to stay, because you are a loyal employee who has been recognized and rewarded for your excellent work. 

Not rude, but perhaps not the best way to respond. Asking if the time is OK makes you seem timid and insecure, and also puts the onus on the recruiter to respond to confirm your question. Better to say something like "Monday at 10 would be best for me, but I am flexible to meet at other times. Please let me know if that time doesn't work." Also would be good to give a range of days and times, since flexibility increases your chances of getting the interview. That said, I don't think your email is anything to worry about -- I would simply wait a few days to see what the recruiter's response is. 

Don't answer your phone? Is the problem that calls are coming to your personal phone, or is the problem that you're getting calls at inappropriate times? If it's the latter, getting a work phone is not going to fix anything. If it's not business hours, it seems to me you have every right to screen your calls, and only respond (by email) if it's a real emergency. By continuing to answer business calls before/after hours, you are simply communicating to others that it's an acceptable practice. Eventually people will get the hint that the best way to get in touch with you is through email, during business hours. 

I wouldn't say dishonest, but it may create confusion. When I see resumes with a number after the title, I honestly have no idea what the number means. A good compromise might be to list your actual title followed by a "friendly" description, such as 

I would argue that you don't point out the employer's recent splurge during salary review. You are correct that "in management's point of view these maybe completely justified decisions." Unfortunately, decisions regarding budget and spending are beyond the scope of responsibility of those of us who are workers, unless we are specifically tasked, directly or indirectly, by owners. When we question those decisions, we risk giving the impression that we don't understand what our responsibilities actually are. We don't have the big picture. It could be that the new secretaries and sales manager are needed to free up sales people to generate new business. Could be that the TV is intended to impress new clients who visit the office, again, for the purpose of landing new business. Ultimately, employers do not have a huge incentive to raise employee salary -- employers have, in a sense, a captive audience who will continue to work (not saying this is a good practice, merely that it's not uncommon). Your best bet is to focus on your specific performance, and how it has helped the company grow, solidify existing business, and generate new business. Good companies will reward those employees who have remained loyal during tough times, employees who understand that sometimes sacrifice is required. 

I would argue that's it's your responsibility to raise flaws like this. If the flaw were to be exploited you'd be kicking yourself for not speaking up. Since the hard part seems to be communicating to your boss, maybe you just need to change your presentation approach. Rather than saying "this is a flaw that needs to be fixed for reasons X, Y, and Z," you could ask for your boss' opinion. Tell him in a casual way you found a potential issue. Ask him if he thinks it's serious, and ask for his opinion on a next course of action. This way you've met your obligation and still communicated it in a manner that allows your boss to maintain control. Edit: If you want to go completely passive and non-confrontational, you could even ask your boss if what you found could even be considered a flaw. 

It's not inappropriate, but you should do research on what salary you could be paid in your local market generally for your type of work. That could be research on job sites, meeting with recruiters, discussions with friends, or similar activities. You might find you're worth a 20% raise, so don't necessarily use your current salary as your absolute benchmark. 

It is not surprising that companies invest a lot of time in the interview process, considering the high cost of a bad hire. In my experience, the quality of a company's hiring process reflects how well structured, disciplined, and organized a company is. In one specific case, I accepted an offer from a company primarily because their recruitment was highly professional. I would say that 45 minutes is closer to the standard, and the 2+ hours interview indicates that the company has a thorough process and/or their interest in you is high. 

Say that you can't accept their current offer, and include reasons why if you want Name your final request, and say that you can't go lower Thank them for their time and the interviews, and mention that you would have enjoyed working in the position 

It's impractical to write every resume from scratch specifically for each opportunity, but I would recommend drafting two basic versions of your resume: one for web development and another for graphic design. I would include all your skills (it's rare and valuable for one person to have experience in both coding and design), but go into greater detail and emphasize those skills/experiences relevant to either coding or design. Once you have those two basic resumes set, you can slightly alter as needed for a specific job, depending on what the company lists as requirements. It's hard work to tailor your resume to jobs, but it increases the likelihood you will be hired -- you will stand above other applicants who have more generic resumes. 

Your target annual salary, divided by 2000, which is the number of working hours in the year, will give you an hourly rate. Multiplying that by 2 is intended to reflect the cost of benefits. That multiplier may be more or less depending on what your needs are and the number of dependents you have. The figure of 2000 hours assumes that you will be working all but 2 weeks out of the year, which is a reasonable expectation for a full-time employee. As a freelancer or contractor, however, you may be very well working much less than that, in which case you may want to figure in a number of hours lower than 2000. The trick is to set a rate that's not too low -- sometimes a rate can sound very high, but depending on what you need to earn and what you need to pay for, it can be easy to fall into a money-losing situation. This calculation is merely a shortcut -- you'll want to do a more detailed analysis of what benefits will actually cost you before entering into a contract. See also $URL$ 

Be concerned about only on those things you can control Dedicate your attention to only one thing at a time 

This all depends on what the word "right" means to you. If this is a matter of principle to you, and you are prepared to accept whatever consequences arise after disobeying your manager, then yes, it is right. On the other hand, it seems unwise to risk your job, or standing with your manager, for the relatively simple task of passing along a message to your colleague. If you refuse, you now potentially share (in the eyes of your manager, rightly or wrongly) in any damages that result from the pirated software. I agree that your manager should be the one to handle this matter, but in your case, is this a battle worth fighting? 

Certainly not -- there are plenty of good software companies that do not (or cannot for proprietary reasons) have GitHub accounts, and still manage to be successful in attracting candidates. 

There might be additional ideas in the question I've linked as a possible duplicate, but an employee shouldn't have to go to such lengths to find work to do. Keep doing what you are doing, and make sure to communicate your activities to your superiors. You may need to look for another job if you do not feel challenged. Eventually you will begin to dislike your job (if you don't already). 

It's very difficult to provide a coherent update when you're in the middle of troubleshooting or designing a solution to a problem. Consider delaying your response until you have a clear idea of the issue, and one or more plans to mitigate or solve. If your manager demands an instant, on-the-spot update, simply say that you don't have enough information at this time, and don't want to waste his time with incomplete information. Then as soon as reasonably possible draft a short, concise update email that you can follow up with an in-person discussion. 

Of course you can! And your employer can in turn be displeased with you to the point where you are marginalized or ultimately dismissed. That's one option. Another option is to find a new job where you can perform skill A all day long. However, because skills are always changing, and it's important to keep up to date, why not try some skill B? As you yourself say, it's more valuable. Before asking for a raise, you will likely need to demonstrate proficiency in skill B first, by successfully delivering a project or two using it. This will give you more leverage in negotiation. After all, once you are proficient in skill B, moving to a new job becomes that much easier, in the event that your employer doesn't want to pay market value for your skills. 

You can ask, but it sounds like your company has deliberately set its PTO policies to minimize cost. Companies like that rarely make exceptions because they fear it will set a bad precedent when other employees hear about it. That said, there's little harm in asking. I would be confident, polite, and explain exactly what it is you want, and why. Is it a one-time long weekend? Do you want to accrue PTO at a faster rate? Be careful in sounding too much like you're simply complaining. Also, be prepared for the answer to be No, and prepare any response to that. Are there any alternatives you or your boss can think of? Instead of extra vacation time, maybe there's a chance for comp time. Try to see things from the point of view of your boss -- if you were in your boss' position, how would you respond to your reasons, and your request?
