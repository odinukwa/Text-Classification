So, you need to know the bit if you're buying tyres or tubes, you need to know the bit if you're replacing spokes, and you need to know the bit if you're re-lacing the rim to a new hub (which will need to have 36 spoke holes to match). Some Context 700c and 14 gauge spokes is standard for road bike wheels. 36 is a fairly high spoke count, meaning it should be durable and relatively easy to repair and re-true. On the other hand, lower spoke-count wheels may be lighter and more aerodynamic (at the possible cost of being more fragile and harder to repair). 

Kevlar fibres do resist cutting, and the kevlar belts in my tyres have certainly stopped lots of sharps (mostly glass and flint). What it won't protect against are pinch flats (which you can avoid anyway by keeping your tyres at the right pressure) and, if it's just a central belt, it may not protect against sidewall cuts either. There's generally a tradeoff between ride quality and puncture resistance FWIW: my tyres are lighter and faster than Schwalbe Marathon Plus (for example), but also less tough. If you want anything more than generalities, you'll need to name those tyres and ask about them specifically. 

means a tyre fitting a 700c rim, with approximate inflated cross-sectional diameter of 23mm. is a fatter (32mm vs. 23mm) tyre for the same diameter rim. Note that even for the "correct" diameter, different tyres fit more or less easily on different rims. A tube described as would fit the first () tyre, but would be likely to burst before filling the greater volume of the fatter tyre. As for a general explanation ... Sheldon's table is probably the best you're going to get. 

measure the interior rim width (you need to remove your tyre to do this) look at this chart, from Sheldon 

tl;dr: no, all chains in common use are the same pitch (the links are 1/2" long). However, there are two widths in common use, and you have the wrong one. 

Measure the chain. You can use a chain gauge, or just a metal ruler. Sheldon describes it in detail, but assuming you have a ruler with inches (and fractions of an inch), you can just measure 12 pins' worth of the chain (under tension). If it it's 1/16th past the inch mark, he recommends changing it. That linked page also has some information on checking for a worn sprocket: if the chain is new (or you measured and it hasn't stretched), and the sprocket is worn, the chain rollers won't sit evenly between the teeth when under tension. If you can see light between the sprocket and chain, it's probably time to replace. 

An eccentric bottom bracket is one way of getting the chain tension correct, but it's not the only one. I can't see any other reason why you'd need to change it, unless you can't get a useable chainline otherwise. 

Sounds like it. (Is there a name-and-shame policy on here?) I found your bike in the Hybrid/Lifestyle section of Evans, since that's a fairly large chain. It's listed at £300 and has a single 3-star review. At a glance, there are two Bobbin bikes for a bit more (£375 for the 7-speed and £410 for the 21-speed) which are a broadly similar shape, with what look like metal pedals, a possibly metal chainguard, and metal mudguards with stronger fittings. They each have a 5-star review and caliper brakes, which in my experience are good and very easy to centre. They also have nicer (rapidfire rather than revoshift or ez-shift) gear shifters. I can't say whether they're definitely better, or would suit you - but you definitely can get bikes with better-quality components fitted. Most manufacturers outsource bulk frame fabrication, and then mix components to hit price points determined by their marketing. For reference, although I described your model as cheap, I don't mean that badly - I paid similar for my first adult bike (although I got it in the end-of-year sale and the list price was higher): the bottom bracket lasted about 4 years, while the brakes, levers, bars, stem, headset, saddle and seatpost are all still going with no problems at all. It's been through a few chains, lots of brake pads, one chainring, two sets of wheels and good few tyres. The drive chain is simpler than yours, but that's my frame of reference for what you should be able to expect. Unfortunately you need to know (or to have a friend who knows, or a shop you can trust) which components are good, and which matter to you, in order to decide whether a given bike is good value. 

They can't control when weak plastic breaks or metal fatigues, but they can fit, lubricate and/or threadlock, and tighten everything appropriately during a service. Some of the items on your list are things they should be able to avoid. 

It's also possible, if you have the tools and the inclination, to make your own from a pair of non-cycling shoes that already fit correctly. Ideally these should have a flattish outsole (so they don't catch on the pedals) which is also thick enough to recess the cleats. You'll still ideally want the stiff insole from a cycling shoe (as here) to spread the pressure from the plate the cleats bolt onto. So, you need a donor cycling shoe whose sole isn't too narrow, but at least it doesn't need to fit around your feet for this to work. 

The light controls the stop line (and, if there is one, the advance stop line). I can't tell from the streetview image, or from streetview itself or the satellite view, whether the cycle path moves from the road to the footway before the stop line or not. If it does - you don't have to cross the line, and the light doesn't affect you (so long as you follow the cycle path onto the footway). If it doesn't, or if you choose to stay on the road, you'll be crossing the line and controlled by the light. 

Yes, but it's only directly comparable if the wind (and surface, and traffic ... but particularly wind) conditions are identical. Since you don't usually have an accurate measure of the wind vector relative to your movement at each point on your ride, you're going to have a pretty rough comparison at best. Even that rough comparison is available only if you take exactly the same route, whereas a power meter can give you some idea how you're doing even on a different route with a different elevation profile. Also, just measuring speed doesn't tell you anything about the power distribution through your pedal stroke, or the (im)balance in work done by your two legs. Whether all that extra information is actually useful or interesting to you, or worth the cost of a power meter, is naturally a question only you can answer. 

Yes, that and the relatively high pressure combine to displace water around the tyre. You don't need special features to move the water if it can easily part around the tyre, and the contact patch pressure is high enough that the water really wants to part. This is the commonly-cited explanation of why aquaplaning/hydroplaning isn't a risk for bicycles. For example, it gives a threshold speed of 66mph at 40 psi. If (for the moment) we take it as gospel, I guess we might just about be able to get a fatbike with huge low-pressure slicks to aquaplane after a fast descent. So, the moral is, if you're doing 50mph plus at the bottom of a mountain on your fatbike and see some standing water ahead, you might lose control. I'm honestly not sure this would come as a surprise in those circumstances. Now, we could spend an arbitrary amount of time discussing which treads are useful which circumstances - slimy, muddy, gritty or whatever. For simple standing water though, there is no advantage. 

It might be possible. It might be safe. The cost of the dental work required if it turns out not to have been safe after all is likely much more than the value of the fork. 

It looks like the Jorvik has derailleur gears, is that right? If so, it probably takes a 3/32" width chain, but your crankset is the BMX/track standard 1/8". Because the teeth have a taper, your chain fits some of the way on and then sticks. Because it's sitting too high, the effective pitch of each tooth is greater, so it looks like the chain and ring have different pitches. Actually, the pitch is the same 1/2" in both cases. If you do have derailleur gears, you can't just get a 1/8" chain to match your crankset, because it won't have the lateral flexibility needed for a 3/32" chain to change cogs. Getting a 3/32" crankset (or a 3/32" chainring for your existing crankset) is the right choice.
