Just yesterday I came across a textbook citation on the Thirty Years War. Here is what I (think I can) remember about the book in question: the author was professor at Charles University in Prague, his book was published in 1972 by Cambridge University Press, its cover blurb said that he analyzed new original sources that had surfaced from former noble estates, etc., to shine new light on the 17th-century period (presumably from a Marxist angle). The prof's name perhaps started with a 'P' and ended with an 'y' (almost but not quite as e.g. in Pokorny). Needless to say, I am today no longer able to trace that book and find it e.g. on amazon. Do you perhaps know the right full citation, or can you describe further leads? I have read e.g. Golo Mann on Wallenstein, and I plan to read C.V. Wedgwood for (presumably) a British view on these monumental events on the continent, so why not add another (again, presumably and from some angle) unconventional source as well. 

I am fairly sure this is Mary's cipher (here are similar specimen). It's a fairly simple encryption scheme and was indeed broken by her contemporary enemies in the 16th century. 

I have always been impressed by the elegance, symmetry (and relative modesty) of the tetrarchy founded by Roman emperor Diocletian (245 - 316). Is it something that was invented at the time or does the system draw directly on earlier precedent? 

In the 2000 Sydney Olympics, we saw the teams of North and South Korea marching together. This was repeated for the 2004 and 2006 (Winter) Olympics. This didn't happen in 2008 (and we can understand that the relationship between Korea and China is very sensitive, so we allow them some diplomacy.) But in 2012 in London they didn't march together. So I'm wondering - what is going on? Have they stopped now? My question is: Why have North and South Korea stopped marching together at the Olympics? 

In this episode of Planet America, the former House of Representatives member Barney Frank made the statement: 

What would have caused this? My question is: This is the second time Australia has had 6 PMs in 10 years. What caused it the first time? 

Australian Federal Politics has been tumultuous for Prime Ministers. The last 10 years have seen 6 Prime Ministers (when a political term in Australia is normally four years). But this is not the first time this has happened. It is the second. When we look at the historic record we see the first time this happened: 

He was referring to India, Canada, USA, UK and Australia. Interestingly enough, many European countries developed democracies around the same time as these countries - but don't have this attribute. (The European Court of Human Rights is in an exceptional category). My question is: What is the reason that European Democracies developed without judicial independence? 

Of course there have been many systems of time, as elaborated in some of the great other answers. There are several differences between time and systems like weight or length: 

So standardizing time was simpler (less competing systems, less people using time), and the benefit of standardizing time was greater, so it happened first. Specifically about the American units: Time was already standardized in Europe by the time the Americas were colonized, while weight and length were not. 

Einstein was born in Germany, speaking German. The Universität Bern is a university in Switzerland. The local language in Bern at the time was Swiss German, the written language in use was German. At that time Einstein published in German, as did the other German physicists. Even today, the Universität Bern communicates with students in German, unless requested otherwise. The default language of the university website is German. Edit: Apart from the language mistake, pretty much everything else - other than the font - is wrong too, as has been pointed out in comments and in the other answer. The original handwritten response can be translated as: 

If we look at the rest of the world, it seems city building civilizations require large population growth which is sustainable through farming. Quite simply, if you can't feed a city, the city will fail. Additionally, in colder regions people need to move to warmer regions with more food in the winter, unless they can store food in sufficient quantities to last through the winter. In case of a bad harvest, it needs to last through 2 winters. If it doesn't, the city will die. In warmer climates people can have more harvests per year, resulting in more food and a more stable supply of food. There were loads of different ways different tribes dealt with this. Due to the winter, people also need to build shelters that are better at keeping the temperature, or they need to burn more wood. If they burn more wood than grows near the city, the city will die. Running out of wood is seen by some as a major reason for the fall of Cahokia, a large city near St Louis. There was also the onset of the Little Ice Age from about 1300 onwards, which may have prevented further growth of existing settlements in colder climates, and even lead to their decline. Solving these problems takes time, and chance. In Central America there were fewer problems to solve, so they had a better chance to reach the city building stage first. Once all of these problems are solved, population growth will likely still be slower in colder climate, slowing down the time it needs to grow from small settlements to large city states. As the size of the settlements grows, trade between settlements is more likely to grow and therefore the rate of advancement of knowledge is likely to increase. These effects can be - and have been - countered through other effects such as traditions, caste systems, religion, government policy, wars, epidemics, natural disasters, etc. But these effects seem to be far less dependent on climate than the consumption of firewood and the amount of harvests per year are. For example the black death affected all of Europe, regardless of latitude. In contrast, in Europe the knowledge of growing crops was imported as was much of the population, so they didn't have to solve all of these problems on their own. Add to that the Roman Empire and the Migration Period, and you see how these developments can very quickly become completely random and unpredictable. 

We can read about the Scottish Highland clearances. It does appear that the driving motivation was that sheep pastures were more profitable. This was the time of the Industrial Revolution, when many people came to the cities, houses were overcrowded, and the surplus of labour meant that working conditions were poor. It seems to me that the Highland clearances can't have been unique - but were part of a broader pattern across Britain. My question is: Was it widespread during the 17th and 18th Century for British country people to be evicted and replaced with more profitable agriculture? 

In school I learned about the British Agricultural Revolution - at the time this was explained as 'increased efficiencies due to crop rotation'. (This now seems a bit simplistic. We know that in Scotland, the Highland Clearances were in part driven by the fact that farming sheep became more profitable than having farming tenants. In this particular situation - something must have changed the economics of sheep farming. Was there increased demand for wool due to mechanisation of wool processing? Did a national market for mutton increase the price of sheep meat? But there were many improvements in agriculture at this time: 

My question is: Is there evidence to suggest movement of a pre-modern people group from South America to New Caledonia?
