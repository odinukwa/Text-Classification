Make a case to them that your skill set has expanded and that you are now taking on additional repsonsibilities and thus deserve a raise. Right after someone else has left is often a good time to do this because they have money available in the budget. 

Some people feel as if any management is micromanagement. Someone who complaints that you are a micromanager without giving specifics or talking to you first before going over your head is no loss to your team. Be happy that he is leaving. It removes a cancer from your team because no doubt he complains behind your back to them too. I have often found the ones who think all management is micromanagement are often the ones who have something to hide like working a second job during their scheduled work hours or slacking off when they should be working or a whole host of problems. Or they are just plain immature. Or they don't understand that managers also have managers and the information they are being asked for is often used to meet the managers needs to report up his chain of command. However your actions in seeking out the advice of articles and others in your group rather than talking plainly and directly first to Brent are also troubling. Your more immediate problem is not Brent however, but your boss. If he has taken to heart Brent's statement that you micromanage, then you may have to convince him otherwise. If he feels he lost a good employee because of you, then he may start to manage you more closely or give you a poor evaluation. You need to make sure that he is not feeling that you are bad even though others have made you feel as if you are doing fine. If anyone else leaves in the near future this will come up again because no matter what other reason that person gives, the boss is going to think of this incident. Personally I would have a talk with my boss about how I manage and how he thinks I can improve. i would talk directly about the micromanagement issue and what I tried to do to fix it and ask him if this is enough or how you can keep this from being a problem with your remaining subordinates. If he still feels that you are a micromanager, then ask him to directly talk to some of your subordinates. It may take several saying that you are a good person to work for to make up for one guy who decided to ruin your reputation. Your boss is not a trustworthy person or a competent manager. He took a complaint rather than sending Brent to talk to you and try to work it out. That was the wrong action, it sends the signal that you are not supported by management. He colluded with his friend concerning whether or not they should hire Brent. That can be illegal as pointed out by @Kevinkline in the comments above 

I always ask for actual work my first day on the job as soon as my computer is set up and I have filled out the HR paperwork. Now learning the new system is actual work and the time to do it may vary, so as soon as you feel you understand enough to get started on a task, go ask for one. But knowing what specific tasks you are going to be working on as soon as you know enough is helpful in triaging what to learn, so you want that information on day 1 if you can get it. Just let your boss know when you feel ready to start if you get it then because priorities may have changed in the week or so since he gave it to you. 

I never accept a task without making sure my boss knows what other things are on my plate and which one(s) will be lowered in priority to do the new task. Anything lowered in priority gets an email sent to the stakeholders to let them know the deadline is moving. It helps if you have a list of what you have been tasked to do with the priorities and you can get him to slot it into that list during your initial conversation. Sometimes bosses are not completely aware of everything on your plate, it helps them to see it. Your boss has the right to set priorities any way he wants, but you need to make sure they are set when there is more work than you can do and you need to make sure those people depending on the the task that was lowered in priority are informed of the delay. Let your boss deal with any fallout from that. 

When you go back to school while working, your personal life will suffer during that period. Yes you should make up the time working nights and weekends. You are investing in yourself by getting the education, this is not something required by your employer. So the burden of finding the time is yours not theirs. If you consider taking holidays during the back to school period to be more important than doing your school work, you are not ready to go back to school while working. Working ten hours days as your regular schedule will make up the days for the regular week. Then build up to the exams by working for 2-3 hours one day every weekend until you have built the hours. Then of course you are going to have to spend time studying and doing the projects. That will likely account for most evenings during the week. If your partner is not OK with that, then I would suggest that it is a bad idea for you to go back to school at this time. Every single person I know who worked on a degree part-time (and I have known a lot of them through the years) got no time off from work except using their vacation time (usually to study for exams). Some of them worked in programs where the classes were on weekends out of town, so they lost a lot of weekends with their families (and most of them had spouses and children) and had the financial burden of paying for hotel rooms. But they had the support of their families knowing a short-term sacrifice could pay off with better salaries and career prospects later. 

You can, of course, discuss options with HR. If the transition of the work is being handled well, I would tend to take a more lenient stance especially when there is a long notice period like this. The reason why is that your other employees will take note of how you behave. Giving people the benefit of the doubt in one situation makes people feel as if they will get that benefit in another. If you are viewed as being a total jerk about such things, you may create a morale problem and a flurry of notice periods. Further, do you really want someone who is unhappy and leaving to be there infecting your other subordinates with their unhappiness? I have worked with plenty of people who I wished would just go home during their notice period because their attitude was rubbing off on others. In one case we did actually send a guy who was retiring home just to keep him from bringing productivity down. So are you really losing much if they work from home or call in sick? Are they going to be productive if you force them to come in? If they aren't productive, will they harm other people's productivity by wanting to chat or a creating more discontent? Further, people often don't get paid for unused sick leave when they leave but it is part of their overall compensation, can you really blame people for wanting to use it? If you crack down on these people, then they will just use it before giving notice, so did you gain anything? You should not expect a lot of work from the person who has given notice other than doing transition tasks. They are gone mentally. That is why I am opposed to dragging out notice periods for such a long time. The sooner they go the better. There is no job that cannot be transitioned in a week that can be transitioned in a month. Jobs that require specialized people to take them over (and you only have the one position), are not benefited by the month because likely the replacement also had to give that notice and still is not there when the person leaves. If an employee died or got seriously ill, there would be no transition. Now I probably would call them to task if they were not doing the transition work I needed done. However, at this point, what kind of stick do you really have? If you fire them you are getting no transition either. Your HR can tell you if this is even a viable option in your legal jurisdiction. It is actually better to have things documented before people give notice, so that transition needed is minimal. 

Timing is critical in suggesting major changes. The first thing you need to do is have a good reputation with your current coworkers and boss. At two months you don't have a track record with them, I would wait until you do. Further changes are more likely to be accepted as the solution to a problem that is happening right this minute. So the time to suggest writing unit tests is right after something major broke on prod that could have been prevented if tests existed. So write up your proposals in business terms (improved quality, lower costs, etc.) and hold onto it until the timing is right. Then bring them up. And remember, don't try to do too much at once. Pick the propossal most likely to be accepted as the first one you bring up. Having a success at a proposal gives you more credibility when you suggest the changes that are likely to be the hardest for others to accept. Also start to find allies, other people who might be supportive of the changes you are interetsed in proposing. It is easier to get things accepted if the others are not fighting the idea. If you have people who have been there a long time, remember, they likely created the current system and they are invested in it. You will have to work harder to get them to accept change. Also do some reading about resistance to change. All organizations have this and it helps to understand it and understand why it occurs and how to politically deal with it. 

I prefer my resume to concentrate on the things I personally accomplished. Where you really want to stress this is in the interview. Prepare a few examples of times when you were the go-to person and helped someone out of a bad place. Usually you can find at least one question where you can bring these examples up. If nothing comes up though, when they ask you at the end why you should be hired, then bring up how much you help others and the depth of your technical knowledge. When you create your list of references include some people who will bring this up when they are called. Ask them to do so in fact. It means more to the hiring offical if someone else calls you the go-to person than if you do.
