Ninja is perfect for low density post-apocalyptic urban warfare. Scouts are essential. Stealth and speed allow you to bring something unexpected to every encounter and defending against stealth adds an interesting dimension. I might not call them ninjas though, ninjas were invisible because they were just like everyone else. They blended in with the normal people. Nobody is normal in your new world. 

So lets work on the Cost of launch. My favorite quote from one of the scrappy new rocketry pioneers was: 

There's a really cool panel in some Batman comic where he rushing to get to a meeting on time and uses his batrang to hit a sniper who is hiding behind a statue. There's a time and place for an exploding boomerang, and it's probably trick shots. The simplest way to activate the explosive is probably with a radio-controlled detonator (maybe use some encrypted authentication so your enemy can't cause your belt holster to explode on you). Advanced versions could have variable timers, variable effects (one boomerang that can slice, burn, explode etc. user decides) Also of course you have to play on the word boomerang. Call the cutting one a cut-erang, the liquid nitrogen one freez-erang, but not never call the explodey one a boomerang because everyone's waiting for it. 

The (very) old fashioned religious argument of "the world is just and righteous therefore the disabled probably earned their place through sin" If lost in a war it could be the case that that specific war had no "good side" the entire war was/is viewed as a pointless power struggle between 'evil' nations who's soldiers are not looked upon kindly. There is only one source of prosthetics that advanced, and no one likes them. Evil company, crazy AI etc... There is no reason and your characters just paranoid. They have connotations with something people have a genuine gripe against. (Sort of like who in WW2 German Americans his their culture and accents despite having nothing to do with the Nazis. Some government, cult, church, charismatic leader, company etc.. Is spreading an ideology which is 90% common sense 10% "we must protect the ideal human form" 

No one designs their protective equipment to be resistant against temperatures lower than they naturally find in the environment they are designed to fight in (unless a significant portion of the enemy is equipped with a freeze ray obviously), however they will design protective equipment to withstand more conventional weapons that are heat based or simply have more kenetic energy. this effectively means that low-temperatures are effectively 'work arounds' for most defences in a world where fire and steel have been around a while and so most defences are built to withstand them. as for what damage it can do well cold temperatures are significantly lethal, firstly they cause brittleness in most iron or steel as well as in many polymers so a "blade of frost" with fast enough heat transfer could turn the opponents nice protective steel plate into lethal metal shards as it hits. Ice burns ($URL$ are also a thing, not a very nice one either. a suitably frosty weapon can even kill with them but they are more likely to do superficial surface level damage which will add a bit to "getting shot/stabbed". If you can reduce someones core temperature (even by a few degrees) either with an ice dagger to the heart or some kind of cold spell then not only can you kill them, but you're also much more likely to temporarily debilitate them. Ever tried running around and fighting after sitting naked in snow for half an hour? its very difficult. on the flipside of that less intense cold magic could be used to cool off in a battle and avoid overheating (which is a major problem especially for many classic fantasy creature like giants that should really according to the square cube law be exploding and for magically enhanced super metabolisms). 

Mechanical combo locks would probably do the trick. I can't think of a way to defeat them with telekinesis. (Provided the restriction on force feedback). Maybe that would change if I could see the inside of one, or play with it with my mind. Standard tumbler locks would be trivial to pick, even without force feedback --you put a little pressure on the cylinder and rake back and forth on the pins till it turns (doesn't work every time, but you can always try again). A one minute explanation of how locks work would be sufficient for a kid to know what to try, and I expect every kid would try at one time or another. Some of my friends got a a lock picking book when I was in high school. After the hard part of making your own picks, a dozen kids learned how to do it --most using the rake method which is slow and less reliable, but requires no real skill or force feedback. Latching padlocks probably won't work either. With a little bit of practice anybody could trip the internal release, I suspect every kid would figure that out in middle school. In my middle school a kid learned that a good hard smack with a three ring binder would pop the lock open by snapping the shaft past the release. Imagine what the telekenetic troublemakers would get up to! And remember a few troublemakers is all it takes for people to invent locks that can't be easily circumvented. You also wouldn't have locks that automatically open from the inside with a bar, handle or lever. Or doors that can pull shut to lock (because those could be tripped by telekinetically pressing on the wedge latch) You could make a cool easy-escape door for fire safety: Lets say there are a dozen buttons around the knob. One of them has a green tab in the window (resets mechanically each time the door opens). If you can see it or feel it you can get out. If not, you can randomly guess, but there's a (3 second?) time-out for wrong guess and maybe an audible alarm. Each wrong guess and the timeout doubles. 

Deep sea fishing, pretty much everything in the very depths of the sea does not depend on sunlight but scavenging from what falls below and on hunting other deep sea life. high pressure fishing submarines (probably robotic) could probably gather a significant amount of food from down their for centuries before even that ecosystem collapses. Even then tube-worms could still be a source of food. Radiotrophic fungi some fungi in chernobyl have shown the ability to survive off only radiation this process is inefficient but a nuclear power could if they so wished dedicate a significant number of resources towards building a "farm" of these that could feed a significant number of people and last many years. if our survivors have a nuclear reactor (a near certainty if its a government effort) they could even use its vitrified waste to expand theese efforts processed fossil fuels while not necessarily a great addition to the human diet and certainly providing no vitamins/minerals/fibre/protein etc...can be made into edible calories in the form of simple carbohydrates like alcohol. many of the facilities required to do so already exist in petrochemical plants and are simply not being used for this purpose (for the first few years at least) the slowly rotting carcasses of everything else, bone marrow locked away in their skeletons and the remaining canned food. ideally large scale "moving edible stuff to the south pole and burying it in 40 ft of snow" operations would be set up. recycled dietary fibre (no i will not go into more detail) though that obviously won't provide calories. 

If you're fixated on fear, maybe figure out a way to make their young taste like bacon. So long as one human survives none of their young are safe. Humm maybe that simply makes them exterminate us. Alternatively we could take a lesson from nature on earth. An injured predator is a dead predator. If a lion thinks lunch is going to be more trouble than it's worth it will back off. Showing that you have the ability and willingness to cripple them (even a minor injury to a lion's paw could mean it can't hunt anymore). Don't try to beat them, stand up a weapon system that makes us more trouble than we're worth. 

Drugs legal or otherwise. Delicate biological goods which are impossible to cultivate away from their home ecosystems. People with specific training or skills. Goods which require lots of labor. (Shipped from where labor is cheap to where labor is expensive) Manufactured goods that one group has perfected and nobody else can quite get right. (Swiss watches a century ago, Italian sports cars today) Manufactured goods or raw materials the production of which causes pollution which the buyers would like to externalize to other cultures. (Rare earth minerals from china) High tech goods shipped from higher tech cultures to lower tech cultures. 

"anti-magic" exists. think DnD's anti-magic field or dispel magic, this would obviously need to be usable by non-magic humans so perhaps there are certain "magic-less" areas that occur naturally and normal's have built all their settlements around them, perhaps there is some material which is resistant to magic perhaps there are machines with anti-magical abilities, perhaps magic goes away every eclipse the list goes on. there are gods/god-like beings/spirits with a vested interest in either normal humans or in preventing magicians from gaining to much power. these could also be a source of anti-magic. perhaps only the faith of normal humans feeds them, perhaps they just fear magicians. normal humans would not need to know of their existance Magical creatures exist that normal humans have bred and trained. (think dragons, sphinxes, giant anythings's or perhaps even vampires or werewolves.), while magical people could also train these it would certainly level the playing field Long term exposure to magic destroys complex machinery. in this way your non-magical people could have anything from muskets to tanks to balance out the magic and magical people would not. (if you have few enough magical people its possible they just don't have the economies of scale needed to build high-tech stuff). Non-magical people simply vastly outnumber magical people, and are reasonably well organised and united. this is not unprecedented many historians believe the reason Homo sapiens out competed Homo neanderthals is simply that we had better cooperation even though neanderthals had most other advantages. You would of course have to come up with a lore reason why Mages don't just reproduce like mad with fertility spells or something but hey. this works quite well with a variant of number 4 Magic is so wild and unpredictable that Magicians pose as much of a threat to each other on the battle-field as they do their enemies. This would make fielding them on the battle-field nigh impossible Killing another human being using magic has side-effects of increasing severity, making using magic to wage war or worse genocide undesirable for all parties involved Magic is dependant upon some reasonably scarce resource, perhaps most spells require gold or a special spice which is a hassle to grow. they where in charge of the world for a great deal of time until event X, the recent state of affairs is an outlier. some pick and mix of the above reasons. 

Biological weapons, design a plague that only attacks your enemies. Give it a couple week latency and a near 100% mortality rate. Mop up with autonomous killing machines. Added bonus is that they can quickly get out of control and cause the robot apocalypse -- because at this point your civilization definitely deserves to be utterly destroyed by your own terrible weapons. 

If we have no ability to choose the wrong path (or if the wrong path is not appealing) there is no glory in the choice of the right path. Or put another way if the only available option is the right one, we are simply vapid automatons acting out an insipid morality play. The greater the power of evil, the greater the deception, the more opportunity for the righteous to attain glory in following the right path. 

Spread spectrum transmission. Channels are infinite right? Alice and Bob both have a good pseudorandom number generator with the same seed ( unguessable but both sides get the same number each time). Assume each frequency can be denoted by or mapped to a number. Shift frequency every tenth of a second (randomize that too if you like) now your attacker must flood an infinite number of channels which takes an infinite amount of energy. This tactic actually works pretty well with our very limited EM spectrum -- even better the more spectrum you give it. Then use normal transmission control retransmits to retry anything transmitted on a noisy channel. (Use more aggressive retransmits in very noisy situations) You can use existing wifi spread spectrum technology for the frequency hopping, and noise abatement, regular tcp/ip for retransmits and single digit percentage loss and everything else as you normally would. Use your asymmetric key encryption on top just in case someone is able to suss out a pattern and start recording/reconstructing your transmissions. Oh and sign me up for your beta program. I'll take two. P.S. Are transmissions traceable? If so it might be necessary to build a bunch of shared routing nodes. Identity protection would require randomized routing so an attacker can't derive distance and direction from incoming signals. Onion routing too if the nodes are untrustworthy. 

UV light can be used to disinfect water, whether this is something a developing society would notice or not is questionable but if they noticed making their wells out of 'tan stone' stopped them getting cholera that would be good. they are actually explosive if I read you right? 'More surface area means more light' so grind them up into high surface area powder and toss them into the air the heat should be pretty lethal. UV light does have a few medical applications such as treating psoriasis which might pop up in traditional medicine. Can be used as a gold substitute, of course its as rare as gold and can could be tested for easily by measuring phosphorescence in an exposed dye or pigment. Could be used as a bleaching agent instead of urine is suppose? With the help of phosphorescence it can make visible light bulbss 

There would be little to no (unintended) effects on the system as a whole, assuming that you're thruster is a pure shkadov thruster and is being used to move the system in a direction rather than being used to affect the system. Taking the sun as an example (simply because its on wikipedia) "with luminosity 3.85 × 1026 W and mass 1.99 × 1030 kg, the total thrust produced by reflecting half of the solar output would be 1.28 × 1018 N. After a period of one million years this would yield an imparted speed of 20 m/s." Compare this with the earths orbital speed of 30000 m/s and you'll see there's nothing to worry about. A great deal of the imparted velocity will in fact simply be dissipated as tidal forces in the stars and planets. There may be more of a problem with further out icy bodies that orbit slower but even Pluto is about 4700 m/s and it'll be over millions of years so don't expect showers of comets destroying civilisation or anything. If on the other hand you put this thruster there specifically to wreck your own system. Yeah you can do some damage, slowing down the stars relative to each other, spinning them apart excreta. Though if you can make such a thruster you have much better ways to kill your entire species off than crashing your stars together over a billion years. 

This is really a philosophical question. What kinds of people form the seed of the society you want to live in? Everyone will choose a different mix, everyone will feel there's is the best choice but there's probably no way to objectively compare two different answers without obvious flaws. The outcome does not depend solely on the choice of people. Other important considerations are the equipment, technology and supplies you get to bring, as well as the conditions on the ground at the destination. I'm going to assume we can bring high technology and basically any equipment we wish and that the destination is largely earth-like (because anything else makes the people question pretty irrelevant) I'm concerned with preservation of knowledge, science and technology. I'd try to bring every shred of knowledge ever generated in duplicate form, samples of all recorded genetic diversity. Redundant expertise with every field of science and technology. And a core of thinkers and artists that represent the best humanity has to offer. I'd bring renowned professors in as many important fields as possible and use the transit time to spread the knowledge around more widely. Consider NASA's practice of choosing highly skilled astronauts with multiple advanced degrees. I'd do loose screens of genetic and mental health (try not to tyrants about it, because nobody wants to live in a society like that) Some additional important questions which will affect your outcomes: How long does the trip take? What's the command structure on the ship? What's the proposed social structure at the destination? 

All known carbon based life uses aminoacids to form their proteins with the proteins being essentially natural polyamides. Would it be possible for life to use hydroxyacids instead of aminoacids making their proteins essentially natural polyesters? If so what conditions would favour this kind of life and would this remove life's nitrogen dependency? similar but different : Life without Nitrogen 

More likely though is its simply known as "the stone that gives you cancer" and is steered well away from 

A nineteen year old can look quite adult, especially behind the usual dirt, facial hair and attitude changes that tend to come after an apocalypse. There's no need for anyone to know he's an adolescent. Espacily if he's not necessarily a paragon of virtue. Alternatively you could lean into his adolescence trying to lead in hard conditions when many of the people beneath you think that you're "actually just a kid" is a hard struggle. Generally in writing struggles for your protagonists can be embraced, I personally would read about a child ruler desperately juggling internal politics, managing subordinates and rivals alike regardless of any zombies. Finally its possible you don't even need a justification, the walking dead is primarily a world gone mad. Child rulers have exsisted in the past and I'd happily follow a twelve year old in twd
