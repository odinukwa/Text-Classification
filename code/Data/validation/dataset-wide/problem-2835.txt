As with everything, it depends on what we mean by "Platonic form" and F=ma. If we mean a form that Plato himself articulated, then clearly F=ma and a^2 + b^2 = c^2 are not forms. If we want to be more charitable in our interpretation, we can presume that we mean that they would qualify under the rules Plato has for forms. Here, I think there's good reason to think your professor is right to call them forms. In your question, you explain what a force is, relating that forces only occur in time, and that forces are independent of human reality. I will address the last point first. For Plato, forms do not depend on human reality. They are not derived from our experience and exist regardless of our existence. So this is a point in favor of your professor's claim -- not against. Moving to the first half, existing forces only occur within time as changes in momentum. But this actually doesn't prove that F=ma is not a form. F=ma is an equation that describes the relationship between mass and acceleration, but it is not itself F, m, or a. To illustrate, it takes a force of 4 Newtons to accelerate 1 kg ball 4 m/s^2. So the force = 4 N. The mass = 1 kg. The acceleration is = 4 m / s^2. But where is the F=ma? It is the relation that holds between them. But if we think this is an unchanging law, then it's quite similar to a form. We generally understand that as empirically discovered, but for Plato reality is recalled per the Meno and Phaedo. And what is recalled and reimplemented is the forms. So if this is a fundamental law that is untainted by the world, I don't see why it can't be a form. The evidence against your professor's claim seems better for the denial of the Pythagorean theorem. Namely, if we can prove something isn't true or is merely contingently true, then its not clear how it can be a form. The hard part will be figuring out whether things like mathematical relations are so. 

Based on context, it seems that Adorno felt that "visits to the cinema" where a species of "idle chatter" (to use a Hedeiggerian expression). And thus he felt that they dumbed people down because they involved the use of language in a way that did not accomplish any sort of meaning discourse. From the same Minima, he includes several other examples: 

Is this the "appeal to nature" fallacy? I don't really think so. Whereas I'd probably call this an "appeal to nature" fallacy: 

Interestingly, this to will is to make the self finite and particular is also central in Hegel's critique of Kant which can be found in Phenomenology of Spirit, Natural Law, Philosophy of Right (which may also make oblique reference to Descartes model but no where that I can recall is as clear as the above passage on the Descartes' angle). (For further reading on its success or failure, there's Allen Wood, Hegel's Ethical Thought and Kant's Ethical Thought (along with an article in Ethics); Sally Sedgwick has a few article that seem to repeat similar themes; it's also touched on in commentaries on Hegel's works such as Charles Taylor, Hegel (1975), Dudley Knowles' Hegel and the Philosophy of Right , Adriaan Peperzak Modern Freedom, and articles by Kenneth Westphal and Thom Brooks) 

I don't think there's any one answer that all will accept on this question, but to simplify the sorting process for you, the real question you are asking is: "What is a state?" and then within this specifically the question of how such a state relates to its members. In terms of philosophical theories of the state (in this case the polis), the earliest two philosophers, I know of, in the West who consider this question are Plato and Aristotle. For Plato, the state is either a small village (early in the Republic) or a complicated system where the members of the state are split among three roles: philosopher-kings, guardians, and producers (for an extended treatment see here: $URL$ On such an account, the parties all agree that this is the best way to accomplish justice as they are enlightened by its presence. On such an account, it makes no sense to split off from the state. From what I understand, there's a different account in the Laws of how things should be arranged but I'm not familiar with the details. Moving to Aristotle, Aristotle believed the state was prior to the individual and the family. What this means is that the state is the organic whole of human living (like a hive to bees or pack to dogs). On such an account, it seems unlikely that it would make sense to split off, but it seems distantly conceivable. Many contemporary Aristotelians are communitarians which means that they think each community is determined by a shared set of values, and that these sets of values are incommensurate with others. On such an account, each community is a polis which can be held together in a larger federation -- but this federation is dissolvable. 

Given these definitions, I do not find the critique against Searle damning to his position. I take the force of the critique as you've articulated to be. 

Many contemporary utilitarians and consequentialists (such as Peter Singer) don't care whether the pleasure/pain is being experienced by a self-aware being or not. Thus, they wouldn't care about the distinction between "intelligence" and "self-awareness" wherever that would be drawn. Instead, the fundamental question would be whether the amount of happiness in the world (or the amount of suffering in the world) would be maximized (or minimized) by the reintroduction of mammoths or neanderthals. This consideration only begins to frame the problem of how to consider this. A second consideration is whether we are looking at actual happiness achieved or at reasonably expectable happiness that might occur. Those who side with the former are going to be more apt to be what are called "act utilitarians" who make judgments de novo at each moment. Thus, for instance, they might say 'let's give it a shot!' and make some neanderthals. If that turned out to make a large number of human people happy or provided us with benefits and didn't create an extreme amount of suffering for the neanderthals, they would say it turned out well. Well, until it doesn't. But if it was just the neanderthals who were suffering, it seems a purist act utilitarian should not have a problem with killing them all. Rule utilitarians, in contrast, are trying to maximize happiness by coming up with a framework that they think will probably yield maximal happiness. To do so, they are going to think about the potential suffering and unhappiness neanderthals could unleash more carefully than act utilitarians before they go ahead and make them. I take it that many (if not all) the concerns would be scientific. But the science is not so difficult to imagine -- would creating them create risk for diseases spreading (mutates in one species jumps to the other)? Would they be treated with sufficient dignity to live enjoyable lives? A third consideration is the harm principle which Mill suggests in On Liberty. At the simplest, do we accept doing harm to some in order to maximize happiness for the many or not? If yes, then there's less reasons to worry about experimenting on making them. If no, then there's good reasons to think we should not even try this experiment as undoubtedly there'd be several trial runs resulting in dead neanderthals. 

But this question is centrally important to your other questions because it provides the scope of what we are answering. So now we can return to your middle question: 

I think the central thing that makes it fallacious is that the unifying feature is that someone is offended by each. But that's not really unifying. Instead, it merely shows that two things have a common effect on certain people -- which does not mean they have the same moral standing. 

There are several ways people can object to this argument, including (a) accepting the infinite regress as okay, (b) denying the validity of the definition of motion [often made under a somewhat suspect claim that QM has defeated this concept of motion -- made by people who still function under it when managing to type and submit things], or (c) suggesting multiple unmoved movers. Also, a semi-unrelated move is to reject the identification of this unmoved mover with God. 

This sort of phenomenon is still present. While not perfect, take a look at the $URL$ and the sub-area rankings. That will show roughly speaking where different departments in the anglophone world are strong or weak. To give a few examples, MIT's philosophy department is known for being centered on philosophy of language, places like Memphis, Boston College, etc., are known for being "continental". NYU is known for being strong in metaphyics. 

Your question is an interesting one -- but there's a second issue that compounds it which mixes a question of empirical psychology with a question that doesn't greatly interest me. The philosophically interesting question is
