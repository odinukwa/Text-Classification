The idea is that under 'normal' conditions we do not get uncertainty principle since inanimate things do not make choices or 'observe' and work purely under deterministic principles, but the moment conscious entity gets involved that can introduce multiple possibilities e.g is able to make choices we get multiple possibilities and worlds start splitting from superposition world into multiple distinct worlds in which versions of different choice-makers live on. Who was first to come up with this idea? What is this theory called? Are there any academic reads around this? 

I however don't see why 'weakly' omnipotent being would break logic by creating another 'weakly' omnipotent being (like copy of itself). Is 'strong' omnipotence required to create another 'strongly' or 'weakly' omnipotent being? 

What philosophical frame is used in this Wolfenstein: The New Order Tekla Monologue? -B Jesus Christ Tekla, aren't you asleep? -T I try not to sleep. No telling if I will ever wake up. -T Let me ask you something. -T Where do you go when you loose conciousness? -B What? -T You have a brain, a brain is a biological computational device running on electrochemical process. -T Your conciousness is an emergent property of said process. -T In other words: you are electrochemical process -T Fundamentally you have experience of continuous existence. -T You are you, at this point in time. You have sensation of riding along this continuum of being you, into the future. -T On occasion brain can be subjected to trauma, temporarily discontinuing electrochemical process. -T Such as a boxer being knocked out. -T As this occurs the brain is no longer running. It's electrochemical generating process. -T Hence conciousness is lost. -T You loose conciousness. Pay attention now. -T At this point in time, your consciousness, all that is you... -T your continuum of being you has caused to exist in the physical world, -T Now, moments later, the electrochemical process may start up again... -T ... allowing consciousness to emerge out of the information stored in the brain. -T But I wonder. Where are you in the meantime? -T Must we not assume that at the point when consciousness is lost, the person dies? -T If a new consciousness appears or not in the same brain is entirely inconsequential to the dead consciousness. -T The new consciousness is simply a new person. -T Because it emerges from the same brain it has access to all the memories and cognitive structures... -T ... as the dead consciousness, so it thinks it is the same person -T But in actuality it is just an impostor. -T Inheriting the body and brain from the previous, now dead, inhabitant. -T Yes? -B What about the soul? -T Soul... -T There is no such thing as a soul. -T We are machines of biology. -T Nothing more, nothing less. -T The soul is simply a pointless concept dreamt up by priests and fairy tale men. 

Bible The book of Proverbs or Ecclesiastes should date before Thales, and I am pretty sure there are even earlier philosophical writings. EDIT: Now that I am thinking of it, 10 commandments are from book of exodus 

Populism is methodology how to achieve your personal political goals by manipulating general population. Democracy is form of government that allows people to govern themselves, through elected politicians or other means. Which to be understood that politicians are elected to serve interests of public, and not those of their own. Populism is form of manipulation it is unlikely to lead to public benefit, such politician would promise to improve lets say healthcare and elected would make contracts with private medical companies that would belong to his associates, and then sink billions of Ruppes with little benefit to public. Such politician would also use 'they will limit your freedoms' tactic to deal with political opponents, even if limiting those 'freedoms' is beneficial to you. I hope this answers why populism is viewed negatively. 

I think it would give you the answer that you will stand (in 10s), but the moment you would decide to oppose and sit it it then would change its answer that you will sit, and if you would not want to sit any-more to oppose it again it would change to stand again and then to sit or however you would think of opposing it. For model to be correct the answer would be valid only for certain amount and your actions such as looking into prediction would have to be variable that is affecting the model so it would be changing it all the time no matter how much you would try to contradict it. I am now facing different problem: Same apparatus in next room should be telling the correct prediction all the time (will you sit or remain standing) as you cannot see and oppose it. How these different outputs should be interpreted? 

Why would it turn good: I can't think of a single reason why TBH. Any sort of symbiosis is not very likely we are simply to slow. Why would it turn evil: How much of an evil doer do you feel when you are eating potato? About that much evil will it feel using you as fuel. Concept of good and evil can hardly apply here. With having this much of a difference between us we would look more like plants to machines, not like something whose opinions should be considered. 

I am programmer I sit in front of PC and produce web systems (in a nutshell). Where does philosopher work and what does philosopher do in his work place? Update: Teaching others does not count, as it is by definition teaching (of philosophy). 

I have couple of 'theories' of my own in this regard. It requires a bit of explanation what I am basing this on. Universe exists because you cannot experience the universe that you do not exist in. So imagine there is universe that in which big bang happens and laws of physics are not just right so it just collapses in to big black hole you do not exist in that universe so you cannot experience it. So you exist only in the universe that is just right for you to exist - not only laws of physics have to be right for life to exist, but your parents have to be in right mood at certain time (wink, wink) or you will never be asking and I answering this question to you. Now you might ask of so there is bunch of universes and we all sit in one of them great - but that doesn't really answer my question how come all the universes came from nothing. How come anything could come out of nothing? This isn't logical! Remember I said experience universe, so how do you know that you exist in this universe? I know question sounds stupid, but you are likely to answer this with that 'I can feel', and here comes Descartes and ruins the day. He says that only way to experience anything is through your senses and then that your senses can be fooling you all along. Then he says that only thing he can be certain that 'He thinks therefore exists' as there has to be something that is doing the thinking but there is a catch. You cannot be sure of this as logic that you are basing 'I think therefore I am' is learned (remembered) and might simply not be true. Now why this stuff about logic and experience - well your question is based on that you have experienced all your life that logic 'works' so something appearing out of nothing breaks this. But this is all based only on your perception and past experience so you pretty much cannot work with logic on this... This part is purely speculation. But based on MWI by Everet () My gut feeling tells me that there must be 'infinity' e.g to anything you ask a question 'does it exist?' answer is always 'yes', and we are just being part of it...
