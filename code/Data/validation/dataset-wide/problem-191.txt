Problems abound. Ceramics are hard and brittle, but this is a common problem with all swords. The weapon will remain somewhat usable as long as the jacket on either side mostly holds together. A steel induction core would allow a temperature just below it's own melting point - depending on alloy, this is likely around 2500 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 1370 degrees Celsius. This particular design could never be held by an unshielded person, so we're probably talking about mechs or powered armor. Either way, hitting one with this would take an appendage with it, but not why you might think - we're not talking about "hot knife through butter" so much as "I annealed the thing I just hit and made it a little softer so I could destroy the inner workings." However, if you could subdue a victim and hold this thing to it's cockpit for a while, you'll have subdued the pilot; and certainly pressing it to something with force will eventually make it through. But I wouldn't expect something like this to work after more than, say, 10 swings against an armored target - 1 if your powered armor is particularly strong. 

Why doesn't anybody ever ask the sailor? In your case, the anchor isn't very likely to be down. Anchoring is a purposeful operation. Abandon ship is a different one. They'd have to have been at anchor first. Also depending on the nature of the emergency, they might have attempted to scuttle the ship, a process of self destruction which leaves classified material destroyed and the ship 100% unusable - every critical system would be hopelessly damaged, usually right around the special, hard to find parts. I can say without a doubt in my mind that the hull can last for countless generations, especially if the ship isn't moving under its own power. The reason hulls have to be maintained is because you are pushing a piece of painted steel through the water at (nautically speaking) high speeds. This is an incredibly erosive force. Sitting (maybe at anchor) for centuries is nothing compared to that, even if the thing is getting hammered by hurricanes. The barnacles would be obscene and it would need a serious amount of work to restore its original performance at speed, but it wouldn't rust through just sitting there. Even after the paint finally gave way and rust eventually set into the (rather high quality) steel, rust doesn't rust once it rusted. Something would have to physically remove the outer layer of rust to expose new metal to the sea. I have no doubt that the ship itself will be ran aground by prevailing currents before the hull simply springs a leak from sitting too long. Now, a carrier group has lots of ships in it. If every single sailor in every single ship bailed out, and none of them were properly set at anchor (I'm telling you, this takes planning), the thing that's going to sink these ships is them bumping into each other. Eventually they'll bob up and down against each other's hull a few times, and eventually the damage will be severe enough to make the ships take on water - and then down they go. This scenario wouldn't take that long - unless they drift apart, this could happen in a few weeks to a few months depending on conditions. 

This depends on who he answers to. Traditionally in maritime law, the master of the vessel is the captain. This legal distinction is to mark a difference between the actual master, and the current conning officer, pilot, helmsman or such. If your person has vested in him the power to decide where to go and who to shoot at, he is probably the master of the vessel. Now if he is not the highest ranking person on board, and especially if he wasn't the only person who could do this, then he would most likely be the conning officer. No helmsman would ever have this level of control of a vessel - helmsman is one of the very first watches new personnel learn, and they couldn't reasonably be expected to maneuver the ship in battle - they just turn the vessel how they were told by the Conn. If there were commercial shipping lanes with hidden obstructions, this person could also be a pilot. The pilot is brought on board a vessel because he has specific knowledge of where to go and not to go for vessels of a certain draft- accurate to inches. If the system was interoperable, professional pilots could come aboard and take control for the duration of the lane, usually no more than a few miles of difficult waterway. 

Control rods are suspended, controlled and monitored very carefully, but any control system can be subverted if you falsify the inputs and/or override the outputs. I cannot and will not give details on how to do this, but rest assured that there is no built in simulator that will just let you fake these. And if you tried it on my old submarine you'd have to kill every last one of us to manage it. And you'd have to bring your own power source, because I will personally destroy every piece of generation equipment before I let you do this. In all cases, a SCRAM is simply the removal of power (or other motive force) from the latching device and allowing it to drop. It is trivial to lose the fuses, smash the controls or axe the cables - all engine room personnel know where they are. The last option is to critically damage the unpressurized side of the rod drivers themselves. All I have to do is make sure there isn't enough wire left to do anything with. In the specific case of slow-fission water moderated reactors, I can also blow all the reactor coolant overboard. It seems counterintuitive until you know that these use water to slow neutrons to the point where fuel will absorb them. The core will probably melt - but you will never achieve criticality, much less the kind of criticality accident this scenario would require. Sources: My training as a former nuclear operator for the U.S. Navy is specifically designed first and foremost to understand and prevent this specific scenario at all costs. 

Let's take a walk through poorly adapted interpretations of high level physics. String theory is probably the closest thing we have right now to a "theory of everything". It holds that all fundamental particles can be modeled mathematically as a string that vibrates in a wave that describes its interactions with the fundamental forces of the universe. One form of the theory, called Bosonic string theory, models all particles except the theoretical tachyon as a set of forces vibrating in 26 dimensions. That's science - the rest of this is pretty much not. First, this depends on these vibrations being completely real, rather than a mathematical model - this may or may not be the case. But, if it is, and if he could sense and control these vibrations, in real time, he could make absolutely anything happen, without exception. Everything involves strings at some level. Invisibility? Flat line the vibrations of the photons bouncing off of you. Teleportation would only be limited to the range in which our subject could make a copy of himself using strings that are at the target area. Walk through walls? Make them incorporeal. Fly? Turn gravity off. Black hole? Convert all incoming light from all sources into solid matter for a while and then force it into a singularity. Note that energy still cannot be created nor destroyed, so adding or removing complexity to these strings will take something from the character. He will have to learn to get that back before it kills him. Fortunately, he will have a readily available source of energy - he could flat line the strings of the immaterial dark energy the planet is (probably) completely awash in. If any of this is possible at all, he could also convert any ordinary matter to energy as a matter of course. It is important to note, that for any of this to have any viable interpretation at all, our subject essentially has telekinesis - and not only that, he has super-subatomic remote viewing, and his brain has to be more effective than a server farm to use it effectively. 

Let me start with the obvious reason why combat aircraft will remain in use - my aircraft will still be needed to operate in my airspace after my lasers have established air superiority for me. Current laser projects are being geared toward anti-aircraft efforts, but the number one goal is anti-missile systems. Now let me give you a brief primer on how to fly over a basic anti-aircraft weapon. 

I have a dear friend with whom I share a deep love of science fiction writing. One day, he told me something that I find to be rather profound: "If you can control gravity, then controlling gravity becomes the least cool thing you could do with that." I understand your need to develop energy weapons that have a reasonable working theory. I'm not going to shoot you down necessarily, but do bear in mind that many, many writers have tried this, and it almost always employs serious handwavium for a reason. If the basis for any of these weapons were particularly possible, it would probably have a counterpart in the real world. For instance, the fictional meson accelerator weapons could target individuals and buildings through a planet without missing. Don't miss out on writing the next epic space opera trilogy just because you feel the need to be very specific. Star wars never bothered to explain its weapons, they just worked. Now, on to the weapons - I cannot for the life of me imagine why kinetic weapons are off the table. A bowling ball moving at 99.999999999 the speed of light is exactly what you are looking for. At that speed, anything you shoot at will be unable to tell that it was a bowling ball - upon impact it will degenerate into a mess of subatomic interactions that will look an awful lot like a nuclear weapon detonation. Surely building a cyclotron accelerator for a bowling ball is trivial to a civilization that can generate stable wormholes? Another point of caution. This wormhole thing may get out of hand faster than you think. Provided that you can arbitrarily connect two points in space and time, you just win, without further discussion. Why not connect the enemy fuel tanks to their crew cabin? Why not put their ship in front of their weapons? Why not suck the entire crew out into space? Or connect their faces to their butts? There is a very good reason "ancient" or "lost technology" is a recurring theme in a lot of science fiction - if the protagonist has a great degree of control over something cool, you have the Superman problem of finding bad guys that pose a threat. Again, I would urge you to consider employing copious amounts of handwavium and unobtainium to build weapons with cool-sounding names and pseudo-scientific mechanisms. The meson accelerator is one totally reasonable example. Neutron bombs, rail guns, and lasers/masers/gasers are real. "Blasters" - as in, beams of light that don't move at light speed and act like sci-fi machine guns - can be reasonably explained as throwing metal pellets through a electromagnetic contraption that makes them wildly hot and accelerates them violently. One could also make a reasonable argument for "plasma weapons" that can quickly build a specific geometry of high energy plasma that is relatively self-contained until it strikes a solid object. You may also want to look into Von Neumann machines and universal assemblers. Beyond that, you're totally making it up, so make it awesome. 

So I learned a lot playing with this idea, and the question lends itself rather well to a thought experiment. If we built a perfectly uniform shell around the earth and it's moon, the net change in gravitational effects inside the shell would be zero. We could build any size shell around any size orbital system and not disrupt the existing orbit. The gravity of each mass object inside the shell continues to behave exactly as it did before. So the real question becomes, could you develop a working orbital mechanic inside a planet sized space? And of course the answer is yes, but the objects inside the space are going to have to be significantly smaller than the space. And while each orbiting body could theoretically have an atmosphere, I suspect that orbiting bodies inside of a thing the size of the earth won't be able to sustain a breathable atmosphere, unless they were surprisingly massive. Of course the outside of the shell gets to be an interesting place. Instead of just having the single center of mass of the shell, it has a vector composite center of gravity depending on the location of each internal orbiting body. The shell itself could support an external atmosphere, but if internal bodies had enough mass, the shell's external atmosphere could compress and develop wild weather patterns in response to internal mass shifts, especially if the orbiting bodies get very close to the shell. And then there's probably a star to contend with in the center of the system. The shell has no correcting affect on anything inside of it, so the shell and all of its contents must independently have developed a stable orbit around that star, and the composite mass of all object needs to also have a stable orbit. Would this develop naturally? No way. Could you build it with a lot of energy and unobtainium? Absolutely.
