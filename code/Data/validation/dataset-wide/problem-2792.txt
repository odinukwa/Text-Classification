First of all, if copying is really involved, why assume the original is destroyed? Instead, assume both survive. It should not change the logic at all. Now, if we are linked to our bodies in such a way that we would share the duplicate's consciousness, then we could transport the duplicate far enough away that the speed of light made a significant lag between our experience and the duplicate's. But if we really share experience due to some underlying identity transcending the body, we should receive that experience immediately. This allows various contradictions to arise in relativity. So I would say, given current science, that this is no longer a reasonable outcome to presume. We have to deduce that every physical copy has its own sense of self, and that one cannot really transport the original by destroying and reconstructing it. 

Weirdly, the most popular ethics is absent from the suggestions, so, although I personally dislike it, I think one of the early entries should represent Utilitarianism of some sort. Real hard-core Utilitarianism would instruct you to consider the effects on everyone, how much they care about those effects, and how this will play out in the future. But that is impossible, and trying too hard is a bad idea. We witness the instability of realistic systems and the Law of Unintended Consequences $URL$ So a lighter-weight, less invested form of Utilitarianism is in order. I would suggest that the one that makes the most sense is probabilistic, prima facie, rule-Utilitarianism. Since paths in the future can almost always be reversed in political contexts, the way to consider Utility best is to look at the most probable immediate outcome of the kind of decision undertaken, to leave it at least partially subjective, and not to drill into the complexities of the future. On that basis, if you are in the majority, the odds are that the benefit going to you is likely to make more people happy, and likewise if you are in a minority the benefit going to the opposition will. This is most likely to add up to the overall good, unless some people will be very drastically impacted for the worse. Marginal utility works in a way that benefits increase happiness less than losses undermine it, (an aspect of the first of $URL$ and that changes to the status of those who are already happy have less effect than changes to those who are already struggling. So there needs to be a special consideration given to negative effects. If there are significant negative effects among those already unhappy with the system overall, you should ignore your own state and favor limiting their loss. This also works to resist hegemony and manipulative oppression. It is important that the rule itself not be complex and cause agonizing uncertainty, or we would be making our Utilitarian decisions in a counter-Utilitarian manner. Hypocrisy really does bother people. Therefore, it is unwise to adopt any more specific rule. The simple two-factor analysis limits your potential guilt, and the worry you are wrong. It also acknowledges human psychology to a limited degree, in that we are not really self-serving individuals, psychologically. We have a certain innate value for fairness. It may not be our primary concern, but we should consider it when it becomes one. Choosing the actual balance point where the minor factor overwhelms the major one is best left up to subjective judgment, presuming the distribution of the factors in the population will be reflected in the individual balance-points chosen by individuals. (Averages of averages are averages, and the aggregate of psychological responses represent social values.) 

I would argue along with @Geremia that the OP's framing is reversed. Science is part of philosophy, philosophy is not an area of science. So it is impossible to classify it among the branches of science. But I would give a less classical and authoritarian reason for believing so. Kuhn would say that sciences arise out of philosophy when they become paradigmatically embedded. They accept a certain philosophical basis and no longer consider it progressive to think foundationally. Even large shifts in foundations, such as the contributions of Einstein to physics, can be borne without abandoning a standard for progress judged from a single philosophical framework. One can interpret challenges like that of Feyerabend as attempts not to abolish paradigms, but to require paradigms with equally strong philosophical roots to be allowed to run in parallel over the same domain of discourse. This emphasizes that each science's system does in fact have philosophical roots. We see this relationship played out clearly when, occasionally, the foundations of a science truly break, like those of mathematics did around basic conflicts between negation and universality, and like physics did around finding an interpretation of quantum behavior. In those cases, those sciences turn to the surrounding areas of philosophy (including theology) in which they are embedded, for ideas on which to base new foundations. 

It is hard to believe anyone can avoid a least some level of relativism, except through hypocritical denial. We have observed that obvious human concepts like universality and negation are not compatible (you cannot have a set of all sets in a universe with the law of the excluded middle.) We have seen the notion of science as a straightforward cumulative form of progress disappear when history is taken seriously (We have Kuhn and the notion of 'revolutions' which seem to be traceable historical facts.) We can no longer seriously believe any notion of meaning that can avoid circular interdependence between domains of definition (Wittgenstein and Desassure have spoken...) We can look at our attempts at truly non-relativist morality and see that they are driven by dialectical cycles (be they those of Hegel's God, Marx's Material or Nietzsche's Genealogy.) So yes, what is true depends on who and when you are. To avoid that notion requires a purposeful blindness that should bar anyone from the field. Reality is intersubjective and non-convergent, and that point of view has been dominant long before 2002. The inability of all forms of 'positivism' to deal with the necessity of paradox inserted into the domain by the dark side of modernism leads us ultimately to Existentialism as a contributing thread to all of our Realisms, in a thoroughgoing form we can never entirely dismiss. Trying to have an absolutist ethics layered on top of an intersubjective and evolving ontology and physics is just hypocrisy. We want to feel as though our current consensus morality is simply right. But we need to look much more often at our own past and the current state of other cultures around us as given facts, not subject to our judgement. We know better, as we have historically judged the world by our own standards and found "them" lacking, which has allowed the righteous among us to do reckless damage and disown it. 

Self-reference and negation have limited compatibility (Russel's paradox and all its relatives) Infinity and ordering have limited meaningful application with respect to one another (the unexpected independence of the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis) Continuity and identifiability have limited compatibility (sorites issues, the quirky limitations of infinitesimals, and the Banach-Tarski paradox) The ability to know which generalizations constitute definitions and which do not, is implicitly limited (important Goedel-Bernays-VonNeumann collections that cannot be sets -- e.g. the 'group' of all groups under products, which cannot be a group because its base set would contain sets of every size but simply is a group from any normal perspective.) 

There is a thread running from Kant all the way to Daniel Dennett, and backed up by our current understanding of how decisions are made in the brain, that implies we do not so much experience space, as project it onto the world. From that point of view, space precedes experience and does not develop. We do develop a sense of physics, but we are ready to move through space from birth. We do not have the ability to focus our eyes, or direct our movements, but we already know things are in places. We are more amazed to discover our hands are the things that produce our own sensations of touching our hands than we are to discover that Mommy's face moves around in a smooth way that we can predict, and that it gets closer or farther away instead of getting bigger and smaller. Space is then an instinctual framework that humans share, that allows them to communicate about the world, and not an aspect of the world itself. Our overall difficulty dealing with discoveries about matter and space not being smooth, flat and infinitely divisible point up both how space might not be as real as we imagine, and how deep our intuitions about it run. 

OK, so you have this prime cause, and you want to name it God. Then basically everything else you predicate of God is bound to be utterly illogical. Especially if words like 'cause' are related in meaning to what happens when they apply to humans. Omnipotence seems highly unlikely. Causation and control are unrelated. Humans cause things they cannot control all the time (starting with children). So to get from First Cause to Omnipotence is basically impossible. Omniscience is also baseless. In fact we witness no intelligence in the universe until relatively late, so this prime cause would probably lack intelligence entirely and would not know anything. Benevolence is irrelevant. Having created something very seldom links you to its final fate. We create material waste constantly, and we are not positively inclined toward it. So this may be a correct argument, but it serves no purpose. This thing you have labeled God is the hyper-Deist God with no mind, no agency, and no moral content. 

I think the general notion you are after is 'mood' or 'modality', as it is deployed in modal logic. But English has such bizarre modal structure that we can't tell from the question which pair of must/must not you mean... In its the most literal meaning, it is the complement of 'can', and the category would be 'necessity', a 'fixed' or 'alethic' mood. In this sense something must happen if it cannot not happen, and it must not happen if it is not true that it might happen or can happen. But we also use must in a sense that is the complement of 'may', and the category would then be 'obligation', a 'cardinal' or 'deontic' mood. In that sense you must do something if you may-not not do it -- to the degree that I or some set of rules I am referencing have the power of obligation, but not coercion, over you and I say what you may and may not do. In that sense you must not do it if it is emphatically not true that you may. 

As religions themselves mature, we may be reaching a point where one can reasonably manage their own faith, seeking between genuine options without being coerced. But we are not there yet. Historically we can see in every era that 'faiths' have been constructed by power structures and tuned for the advantages of certain groups, generally not for that of their whole base of believers. Turning over part of your basic thinking to a group is a weakness because it concedes control over certain things to someone who does not answer to you in any way. It means that if you decided something was wrong, you would be subject to a certain level of bullying about it, and would be likely to concede to that bullying in order to have harmony. At the same time, scientific paradigms and cohesive cultures do the same thing. As an American in a technical business environment, I am subject to a certain kind of bullying when I question the effects of gender roles. It is exactly the opposite kind of bullying than what my mother and grandmother faced, and that my (erstwhile) religion pressed on me in my youth. But the culture is seeking a norm, and in the process it wants cohesion. And we see folks coming from a strong faith in certain aspects of science pull them out to use as a bully club at whim, often to shut down religious opponents, but sometimes just to assuage their own insecurity. (I find Richard Dawkins open bitterness and endless insistence to be a form of subtle bullying. And Christopher Hitchens seems to have no reservation about using his intelligence as a weapon in ways that are sometimes not entirely forthright.) So this is not a weakness that is specific to religion, as religion is not the only form of faith. And since we are social animals, what is personal weakness contributes to group strength. Knowing that members of a given labelled group will sacrifice for one another and compromise can create something that in the composite is very helpful - social cohesion. That group strength, in turn, can feed personal strength. So the overall effect of many forms of faith is to trade one kind of weakness for a different kind strength. The reason it is not seen as unexplored is that we have spent millennia exploring it. The unfettered mind has traditionally always been expressed in religious imagery. It is very difficult to escape. Even when people become atheists most reserve a sort of mystical reverence for the human mind that has a definite religious content. There is no shortage of exploration here, and there is no reason why mystical thoughts that are not structured by a tradition are any less capable of continuing that exploration.
