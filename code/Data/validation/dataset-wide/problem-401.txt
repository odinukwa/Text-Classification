To start with: I don't think it is feasible to make a weapon like this that can be used in a fight. As a display weapon however, any of the other answers would probably work. Something to take into account is the incredible amount of force that acts on various parts of a bow to fire an arrow. I don't have math to back this up but I do DO archery - something that can absolutely destroy any bow is to "dry fire" it. That is - to draw the string and release without nocking an arrow. There is no resistance against the string in this case and it can BADLY damage the bow to even do this once. I think that the force of swinging swords against stuff would probably mimic damage similar to this. I will say however that since they would be probably made of metal or other "stronger" material than laminated fiberglass and wood, then they may survive this better than a normal bow-limb would. Running with the idea anyways: Regarding disassembly, there are plenty of bows that are intended to disassemble. They are typically made of three sections: two limbs and a handle-section. (the black piece in this image is a stabilizer that is unnecessary to have) $URL$ When the bow is strung, the curve in the limbs is actually flipped around such that they are curved in the OTHER direction - this is what allows them to "snap" and fling the arrow effectively. More traditional-style bows do use straighter limbs, however I do not think that they shot as far or as accurately. The feasibility of this sword-bow will also be dictated by how effective you want the bow portion to be. Do you want to be able to hunt with it and hit a small spot on a moving target (ie. a kill-shot)? Or do you simply want to be able to fire an arrow in the "general direction" of a target? If you want any measure of accuracy, then the limbs must not have any "twist" in them, and there must be no variance in how the bow portion is constructed each time. For example: a handle sliding together together to grasp the limb portions by the hilts as others have suggested MUST lock into place at the exact same spot every time. The string cannot vary in length or twist either. (Bowstrings are composed of several strands that have been joined into loops at the ends and twisted down the middle. More twist means a shorter string and more "shooting force" and a short string forces the limbs to bend more.) Furthermore, unless you are assuming a "very good or above" level of archer, then there are other "must haves" on a bow to allow/help with repeatable shot placement and reasonable aim: a reliable shooting platform ("arrow rest"), a string that only fits on the bow in one direction (ie. it cannot be flipped upside-down) as there is a "nock-point" that should be attached to the string to enable consistent arrow placement every time. This nock-point is not centered (it is close however) but is positioned according to the arrow-rest so that the arrow shoots straight. Perhaps the string could be stored inside the handle section on a spring-loaded roll. One end would be fixed to the handle and the other end could be pulled to run the string up the front of the sword-limbs (and sit in a groove to stay centered on them) and then down the backside of the bow to hook into a notch on the bottom sword-bow-limb. (The string would be attached in the middle to the front of the bow handle and looped over the bottom bow limb as a normal bowstring would be.) That would at least handle the string issue and keep a nock-point in the same place every time. If the user were to carry a middle-section to join the sword-limbs to, then that could potentially also work and would take care of the arrow-rest portion. It might take a few moments to switch from one form to another however so it probably would not work in combat. You would have to carry a quiver of arrows, although some quivers do actually mount to the side of the handle-section of a bow to store 3-5 arrows by clipping them into place. 

Small hole and pressure led me to a thought... a cannister of compressed gas (soda syphon CO2 or a cycle emergency inflater CO2 or a soda-stream gas bottle) connected to a needle and release valve. Whack it in through some convenient place (temple?) and hit the gas release, taking the inside of the head up to considerably over-pressure. If the device is fragile the pressure shock may break it. The temperature shock of expanding highly compressed gas may also be enough to break it. If it isn't broken by that, the brain being driven out of any convenient apertures (ears? eyes?) and carrying the device with it would probably prove fatal to the device. I think it's fair to say that the person carrying the device in their head wouldn't survive the experience. You'd need to use CO2 or nitrogen or some other gas that had a high vapour pressure at ambient temperature... butane used like that would kill the person but wouldn't elevate the intra-cranial pressure that much. 

With the context above, why would they work together? I want them to work together, I just don't know why would they? I have not yet finalized these predators, I am looking for suggestions, or ways to modify or design them so that cooperation will work - maybe something symbiotic? 

You are set on the word "mimic" but really what you want is a creature/trap that looks like a chest to fill the role of "mimic" from other traditional fantasy settings (or D&D). I have a solution that can make this work, but it will mean abandoning the chameleon-like nature of the creature/trap. The creature/trap would perhaps be better as a plant, such as the Venus flytrap 

Have no prevailing wind... such that for some part of the year it blows one way, for another part of the year it blows another way... For instance a mountain range that sits at around the line the jet stream would like to follow, fluctuations in the jet stream could mean that the side of the range that gets the rain would be changing on a irregular basis. If you consider somewhere like the UK, some of the time the wind comes from predominantly the west, but under the influence of waves in the jet stream low or high pressures get held over the UK and wind instead comes from the south or the north west. 

Someone else mentioned D&D. Expanding on that: Clerics have a really large pool of spells to choose from but can only have a certain amount known at a time and these are divinely given knowledge. They really have no idea how they work, other than they do. Sorcerers are the innate, powerful type that have inherent talent but a fairly limited pool of spells. Wizards are the scholar-type magic user - they have to spend time each night to memorize the spells they want to use the next day. They have a wide array of magic (though not as much as the cleric) and can cast some powerful spells but tire quickly. Perhaps you can make distinctions in the effort it takes to learn/cast the spells that is tied in to the source of the magic. For instance, a genetic-ability person could cast some instinctively but have a hard time learning and casting more than that. A cleric type may be at the mercy of their deity and randomly forget some spells overnight - education and training for them may involve learning how to recognize what they have available each day or learning to actually learn the spells once they have them so they can still cast them after they would otherwise forget albeit at a less powerful level. A wizard would simply need to be in school for EVER and take a while to learn new things - in this sense wizards would typically focus on one or two specialty spells and market themselves as masters of certain useful things. Healers may get their powers from nature (perhaps they are human-dryad half-breeds) and need to be in contact with some form of flora or fauna to actually cast a healing spell. I like what you did with the Hexer class - using life-force is a good way to make a distinction and at the same time give them a limit. Also, I love what Jonah said (and don't know how to properly quote him): " [Witches] won't kill themselves trying to stop the tide or do something similarly ridiculous. Maybe they look down on sorcerers, who always seem to be setting their villages on fire." I play D&D with a sorcerer who randomly farts out bursts of uncontrolled magic... It makes things really interesting when he is trying to kill a zombie and instead casts levitate on the skeleton archer. 

In terms of low-tech bakeries (typical medieval bakeries for instance) the oven would be internally fired to get it hot and the bread 'just' plopped down in free-form dollop shapes onto the oven floor. There's no expense of buying tins to bake in, there's no effort needed to clean the tins and no need to store tins for each type of loaf that is made. And if fashion changes and a 'new' shape loaf becomes fashionable then you'd need a whole new set of tins. Given the absence of cheap tin-plate, bread tins would be heavy, take a lot of heating up and therefore take a lot of heat out of the oven. When it comes to transporting bread... sacks don't pack hexagons much better than dollops. All in all, there's no benefit in making bulk bread in medieval times in tins. Also if you're using an artisanal flour with your own variety of yeast, the behaviour of the dough won;t be consistent. Making consistent loaves from inconsistent ingredients would be an extra overhead. Now if you accept uniform ingredients and cheap tin plate you can more easily make a hexagonal tin (a closed two-part tin with ends) and make a consistent hexagonal loaf. In the UK there's a loaf called 'milk roll' that is mould-made in this way... as a ribbed cylinder with flat ends. But it's dependent on knowing that an amount of bread will rise in a given time to fill the tin completely, that the oven temperature will be reliable and consistent across the loaves cooking at any time. It's a high-tech loaf rather than a low-tech loaf. If you want to consider authorities imposing dimensions on bread... consider the laws in France about dimensions and weights of baguettes. See for instance $URL$ that hints at the law. So it can be done, but not in hexagonal tins! 

I imagine there would be many small points of failure, but likely these would have backups, replacements, and redundancies.. But how do you guarantee no major, or critical systems or resources won't fail? Some systems to consider: 

So in the process of creating my world, I came across a question that I could not find the answer to. When do you decide that a nation is a City-State, a Kingdom, or an Empire? I am going to start by saying that any small settlement or town that is not at least a "City-State" (ie, with an army and a local government of some kind) are not relevant to this question. Throughout history not all City-States had Kings, but some did. Some Kingdoms only had a single city in them, and some Empires were only a single Kingdom. So where do you draw these lines? Are these definitions arbitrary? What makes a Kingdom a Kingdom and not a City-State or an Empire? etc. 

Something like a Mallen streak... with both parent and child initially being so thoroughly dirty that they can't see each other's hair colour oddity... or both wearing headgear that covers it... or it being considered a mark of something bad so it's normally masked by dye and gradually grows out in the child. Or as in GoT... a blond child produced from a family that only ever produced black-haired children. 

If you build with arches (or vaulting which is sort of the 3-d equivalent if you consider a wall as 2-d) there's no tensile strength needed... all the load is compressive. You can use precision-cut blocks or just about any material that will stick together to fill the gaps between blocks that are not precision cut. So you can build using whatever rocks are available... and anything that is vaguely cement-like for gap-filling. The building material doesn't have to need any tensile strength and nor does the filling material, it just needs enough strength to hold itself in place. You could even use something like lead hammered in. Look at all the mediaeval cathedrals in Europe, Roman aqueducts, castles... all of them are just about 'heaps' of stone in compressive loading with nothing tensile at all. You only need reinforced concrete or steel or timber to make lintels and flat spans... without it, you're limited to arches and somewhat more massive floors - you built a barrel-vault 'ceiling' and then you probably fill the top of the barrel vault up with loose fill to get a 'level' surface for the next floor up. Okay, no wood for the roof, you just make it vaulted and waterproof... and fit drains. No skyscrapers, but you can build several floors up before the walls at the bottom get so massive they use all of the room space. But it's a lifeless planet... so you can build wide and low, there are no neighbours to complain. 

The question is pretty straightforward: Why would two species of predator with the same prey cooperate? I am looking for answers in the following context: 

Lets say you have developed a Utopian society. Let's say this society has in some way made a self-sustaining fully self-sufficient ecosystem. For the purpose of answering the question, let's say its a society of 1,000,000 (one million) humans living in a huge space station. You would ideally want this ecosystem to sustain itself indefinitely. How can such an ecosystem be designed to have no single-point of failure? 

If your handwavium gas is a compount of gravity-negatium (say for the sake of chemistry handwavium gas is gravity-negatium pentahydride) and gravity-negatium has a nucleus that really massively is repelled by normal mass... and ignoring the fact that all the handwavium would have scooted up out of the atmosphere just as fast as it could... you could make a suit of armour that had no weight at all. But as others have pointed out, it would still have mass. You could stand up in your brass/handwavium armour that masses 1 tonne, but the amount of power needed to get a single leg moving would be akin to towing sacks of sand. And once it was moving, it wouldn't readily stop. So if my some miracle you got your leg moving, you'd have to expend the same amount of energy to stop it when you put your foot down for the next pace. And if my some miracle you got yourself running at full charge towards the enemy, you'd be like an oil tanker with a five mile stopping distance. Effectively, you would be about as mobile as if you were standing inside a pill-box, great for getting in the way of things but useless for fighting.
