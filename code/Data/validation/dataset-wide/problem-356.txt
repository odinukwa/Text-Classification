(This organism is based on the "pequeninos" from Speaker for the Dead with some inspiration from the specworld Illion.) Is such an organism and its reproductive cycle plausible? 

So a species has three phenotypes. If any two of the phenotypes produce offspring, it will display the phenotype of either of its parents. There is no possibly of displaying the third phenotype even if one paternal grandparent and one maternal grandparent displayed it. How could this work under Mendelian genetics? 

Under what circumstances would a species develop an adaptation to employ surrogate wombs of their own species or others? The species implants its zygotes/eggs in the uterus/brood pouch of a surrogate mother/father, of its own species or another, which gestates and births to the offspring. This is not endoparasitism, parasitoids, or external egg laying. This is an exaggerated form of brood parasitism. 

What sort of planetary conditions would create an environment like this? High gravity? Dense atmosphere? An extremely powerful magnetosphere? EDIT: After researching the floating mountains from James Cameron's Avatar, I found it is technically possible to have floating mountains composed of room-temperature superconductor propelled by a powerful magnetosphere and would cause massive radio and electromagnetic interference. The downside is that the magnetosphere would be strong to shred vehicles and rip the iron from your blood, but the alien biosphere and civilization presumably adapted to use non-ferrous metals and shielded electronics. 

Some species which reproduce sexually will replace one sex with (or add) hermaphrodites. The coexistence of males and hermaphrodites is androdioecious, females and hermaphrodites gynodioecious, and all three trioecious. In the absence of a male or female to mate with, a hermaphrodite is capable of self-fertilization. On Earth these strategies are found in plants, nematodes, and rarely fish (the same terminology is applied to both plants and animals in papers). In all these cases the species only ever has two sexes. A sex is defined by the types of gametes produced: males produce sperm, females ovum. Hermaphrodites do not constitute a distinct sex because 1) they produce ovum and sperm and 2) they reproduce by fusing ovum and sperm. To constitute a third sex, a species must produce three structurally distinct types of gametes and all three must be required to reproduce. 

Trioecious reproduction The definition of a sex is that each sex produces a unique type of gamete. If it does not produce unique gametes then it is not a sex. A caregiver that does not contribute genes is a caste or morph. The advantage of being triploid and trioecious is that this reduces the risk of genetic bottlenecks and inbreeding depression. The disadvantages are that three individuals are required to reproduce and, contrary to popular belief, reduce phenotypical diversity. Recessive alleles are fair less likely to display phenotypes because three copies would be required. An environment where trioecious species outcompete dioecious species would need to place greater selection pressure on genetic redundancy over the costs of finding mates and reduced phenotypic diversity. An example of a true trioecious species occurs in the speculative fiction novel Silent Runners (Source). Hybridogenesis Hybridogenesis is a form of sexual parasitism where one species is limited to a single sex and must parasitize the opposite sex of a closely related species in order to reproduce. The genes of the parasitized parent are discarded from the germline of their hybrid offspring, ensuring that the parasite species' purity is maintained. Thus, species that engage in hybridogenesis may qualify as possessing multiple sexes on the demographic level. For example, the Iberian minnow consists of triploid males, triploid females and diploid males. The diploid male is a sexual parasite whose offspring are always diploid males, and ultimately requires both triploid males and females to reproduce. Social Hybridogenesis Social hybridogenesis is a form of hybridogenesis found in certain eusocial ants. (Source) Symmetrical social hybridogenesis occurs when the parasitized species adopts the same strategy to parasitize the parasitize. The ant genus Pogonomyrmex, for example, has two species with four sexes on the demographic level. Each colony requires three individuals to reproduce: the female mates with males of her species and the other. Males are spawned asexually by females. Same species mating produces only reproductive females. Cross-species mating produces sterile hybrid females that form the worker caste. Collectively all four sexes, two males and two females of different species, are required for both species to survive. To put this by analogy with cells in one organism: reproductive cells require gametes from the other species to produce somatic cells. This would not work the same way on the organism level. There the analogy would be the female produces a sterile hybrid offspring which she parasitizes similar to the anglerfish. As far as I know this strategy does not occur in any known species. 

On this hypothetical world the niche that would be occupied by plants is instead occupied by fungi living in symbiosis with cyanobacteria and/or algae. For example, the tissues of the tree analogues are actually mycelium, highly specialized in a manner similar to the zooids of siphonophores. How plausible is this scenario? What other adaptations would the lichen be expected to have? 

Virgin (parthenogenic female) impregnates herself with female (sexual female) offspring male comes along and fertilizes the females inside the virgin's womb females are born or eat their way out of their mother Females gestate male and virgin offspring Males and virgins are born, hatch from eggs, or eat their way out of their mother See step 1 

So I have a brain parasite that needs to enter the skull of a host organism (in this case humans) with the least amount of effort, but is too large to enter through the circulatory system and must physically crawl inside a host. Drilling through the skull is the most difficult option and will likely cause fatal infections. This is fine for brain parasitoids that eat the host from the inside out, but not for parasites that need the host alive for longer periods. Going through the ear canal still requires destroying the middle and inner ear which would cause deafness and loss of balance in addition to still drilling through the skull and causing fatal infections. At this point the most efficient and least destructive options seem to be to enter through the nostril/nasal cavity or eye socket where the brain casing is thinnest or absent and drenched in insulating mucus. What option makes the most sense? 

Biradial symmetry occurs in ctenophores: the body plan consists of two halves which independently display radial symmetry. Spherical symmetry occurs in Volvox algae: any cut through the center of the body results in two identical halves. Hypothetically, an organism could display spherical symmetry. For example, an organism resembling the mythical amphisbaena with a head analogue at either end of its body. How plausible is a spherically symmetrical body plan in animals, or at least in basal animals or ancestors of derived animals that discarded this symmetry? EDIT: Spherical doesn't have to be literal. The organisms might be worm like with a gut that opens at both ends, but the gut orifices are two way or the anus is located ventrally. I expect that as the spherical symmetry organisms grow larger and enter more niches they would undergo cephalisation. I would think there would be vestiges of their ancestral symmetry. Similar arrangements of body parts in front and back? Vertebrates have two eyes and two gonads by chance, but maybe in this organism the eyes and gonads develop from similar embryonic structures? If the basal gut was a two-way tube, then maybe the derived organisms have a anus in the ventral region rather than the posterior? 

Since I cannot accept magic without redefining the laws of the universe around it, I use "sufficiently advanced technology" as a substitute. I have given much thought to Sanderson's laws and Clarke's laws. Where Sanderson's laws and Clarke's third law intersect is where problems arise. Technology trumps magic in every one of Sanderson's laws. 

If the soul isn't suffering, it's not wrong If the soul is not suffering, then there is no moral reason that animation is wrong except for respecting property rights. The corpse, by most laws of inheritance, defaults to the ownership of surviving relatives who are free to do with the corpse as they wish. If they want to donate the body as a laborer in order to pay off bills rather than deal with the additional costs of a funereal, that is their right. For an example of how arbitrary the morality is, look no further than the Necroscope series. The protagonist is a medium or "necroscope" who speaks with the dead and may call upon them to rise from their graves and assist him. The antagonist includes "necromancers" who mutilate corpses to learn their knowledge, which the dead souls feel despite being dead. Otherwise the dead don't care about the condition of their unfeeling remains. 

A hypothetical organism alternates between plant and animal stages over its life cycle. The organism exhibits equally extreme sexual dimorphism. The generations are diplobiontic a la some species of red algae: gametophyte (androphyte and gynophyte), carposporophyte (microcarpophyte and megacarpophyte) and tetrasporophyte (microtetraphyte and megatetraphyte). The life cycle occurs like so: 

Something I find deeply unsatisfying in my reading of fantasy fiction is that magic is invariably treated as a means to cheat real physics. The fantasy world is built to operate according to the way modern science says our world does, and then a self-contained set of magic rules is tacked on to allow magic-users to arbitrarily cheat the laws of physics transplanted from our world. If technology is introduced then it operates according to real physics and thus separately from magic; in some cases technology and magic may be actively opposed (conversely, magic-users relying on real physics for their biology are not poisoned by using magic). In contrast, when what is more or less physics cheating magic appears in science fiction settings it is usually treated as advanced technology, a quirk of physics or simply left unexplained. Star Wars has magic powered by mitochondria, Farscape has alien wizards, Andromeda gives stars intelligence and humanoid avatars, etc. How could one devise a magic system that isn't just a shortcut to cheat physics whenever the user desires? Replace magic with sufficiently advanced technology? Make all physics work according to magic rules? 

In superhero comics the world is identical to our own aside from horrific collateral damage being wreaked every week. Super villains regularly destroy cities and murder millions. The mundane crime rate is unsustainable orders of magnitude higher than in the real world. Clearly something is maintaining the status quo so that civilization doesn't collapse. The ashes of cities are raised up good as new; the mountains of corpses are resurrected and sent back to their jobs. Life goes on as usual. Another day, another world ending disaster. Why would that world even remotely resemble our own? If people are living in Purgatory, why aren't they acting like it? Why do civilians keep going about their daily lives? Why do criminals keep committing crimes if everything resets? 

I am attempting to develop a coherent argument for a "prime directive," or law that respects the right to self-determination of less advanced civilizations. In Star Trek the Prime Directive is generally used to justify genocide, which I would attribute to bad writing. If there wasn't a prime directive, then what would protect less advanced civilizations from being forcibly colonized and sanitized by an more advanced civilization? This has happened many times in human history and the disadvantaged civilizations are still rebuilding centuries later. Japan rapidly industrialized and became imperialistic conquerors in direct response to the USA's gunboat diplomacy. The government still denies that they committed numerous atrocities that were extensively documented. China has a cultural imperative to assert their superiority after the self-described "century of humiliation" inflicted on them by the British. The British, in another display of gunboat diplomacy, coerced countless innocent people into addicting themselves to opium. Vietnam is still suffering the effects of Agent Orange. When they tried to sue the USA for damages their claim was thrown out of court. The descendants of USA veterans suffering those effects did get compensation. Africa has numerous active war zones. Most of the indigenous civilizations were wiped out by Europeans and they had to rebuild from scratch. North America used to have numerous ancient ruins, rivaling the pyramids, which were demolished to make parking lots. Like Africa, most of their indigenous civilizations were wiped out. I cannot imagine any reason not to have a Prime Directive that prevents interference in the affairs of civilizations that cannot adequately defend themselves. (I don't count natural disasters like asteroids. Starfleet has a moral imperative to stop those.) Imagine how a space faring civilization would go about forcibly uplifting less advanced civilizations ostensibly for their own good. A medieval planet would see the arrival of benevolent invaders who force them to give up their culture because it the invaders find it repugnant. If the aliens refuse, the invaders would have no choice but to enslave and indoctrinate them. Essentially, the Borg. 

Two vastly dissimilar organisms turn out to be the same species upon gene sequencing. In this hypothetical animal species one or more components of the life cycle is a fungus, algae, plant, lichen or other vegetative organism. The species may transition from animal to vegetative or vice versa between instars, it might alternate between vegetative and animal generations, or one of the sexes is vegetative. How feasible would this be to evolve? What selection pressures would promote this adaptation? The ancestral organism doesn't need to be an animal. (Inspired by Descolada from Speaker for the Dead and Orks from Warhammer 40,000.) EDIT: here are some more detailed examples. 

Real parasitic plants target only plant hosts and in certain species fungal hosts. How plausible are parasitic plants (or algae, lichen, or other photosynthetic organisms) that targets animal hosts similarly to parasitic fungi? What would be efficient survival strategies? What evolutionary pressures would select for animal hosts? 

A genetic engineer devises a symbiotic virus that permanently copies itself into the genome of its hosts and the germlines of all their descendants. The purpose of this virus is to genetically modify the population without their knowledge or consent, thus there is an impetus for medical professionals to be on the lookout. The engineer and their opponents are now locked in an Red Queen style arms race. What strategies would enable the virus to evade detection? 

I am trying to write a story occurring in a retro-future setting. The civilization in the story is a hodgepodge of contemporary Canadian-American culture and faster-than-light travel. I know this is unrealistic compared to posthumans strip-mining the galaxy to build dyson spheres, but I am writing for a general audience. I am using the Alcubierre drive as my point of reference. It requires multiple stellar masses and exotic matter with negative mass to be feasible. I keep running into the question of why the space military are not deploying singularity projectors, offensive teleport, time travel, and similarly apocalyptic weapons when fighting an interstellar war. I cannot fathom how this civilization developed god-like manipulation of gravity but only use it to make cruise ships.
