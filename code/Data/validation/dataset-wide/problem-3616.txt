I'm going to assume that the point about reading during cardio is that you will be exercising at a lower intensity. Low intensity cardio exercise is very effective at burning fat if you are doing cardio first thing in the morning, or if you are on a low carb diet. If you are not on a low carb diet, which was not popular when the bodybuilding bible was written, then you will be more effective at fat loss with higher intensity cardio activities which would be inhibited by distractions like reading. 

The two are definitely related. Changing the orientation could help, but then maybe you would have the same issue in another area. Being aware of the fact that your head orientation does affect the musculature in your neck is a good star to finding a solution. I am a big fan of regular massage. While massage will alleviate some issues, daily stretching is the thing that will keep these pains from developing into a chronic problem. There are lots of good neck stretches that you can do while sitting in your chair. Grip the bottom of the chair with the left hand. Reach over your head with your right hand and place it on your left ear. With your neck in neutral position, pull your right eat down toward your right shoulder. Hold for 2 to 3 seconds, release and return to neutral. Repeat several times then duplicate on the opposite side. Next turn your face 45 degrees to the right, and reach your right hand up and place it on the back of your head close to your neck. Pull your nose down toward your right pec. Hold for 2 to 3 seconds, release and return to neutral. Repeat several times then duplicate on the opposite side. For the last stretch, turn your face 45 degrees to the left, and reach over your head with your right hand, and place it on your left ear. Pull your right ear down toward your right pec. Hold for 2 to 3 seconds, release and return to neutral. Repeat several times then duplicate on the opposite side. You can do these stretches several times a day, but don't stop doing them just because it feels better. Unless you change your work conditions, you should probably continue to do these on a daily basis. If these stretches do not alleviate the pain you're experiencing, I would suggest you consider seeing a physical therapist to address a possible underlying problem. 

The basis of any exercise for muscle strengthening is a stretch and a contraction. The type of aggressive stretching you are doing is actually similar to a strengthening exercise, and soreness is to be expected. You're actually tearing your muscle fibers to create that soreness and your body will repair the muscle afterward making it stronger, but that is the natural process of increasing strength. If the soreness has not alleviated by the time you are attending the next class, I would ease up on the stretching. You don't want to tear your muscle fibers stretching, and repeat that activity before your body has the opportunity to repair it. That could easily develop into an injury. 

If you have cellulite, it's going to be the last place your body loses fat because it's the hardest to access for energy. You have to lose cellulite through diet and exercise just like any other type of fat. Try taking Yohimbine HCl to help mobilize the fat. It seems to redistribute the fat and you should lose weight more evenly when taking it. Even when I am getting ready for a bodybuilding contest, the cellulite on my butt sticks around until only a few weeks out. I can be ripped everywhere else, and still have a little cellulite texture on my butt. To some degree it's genetic, and there's not a whole lot you can do about it 

I am a bodybuilder, and can give you some tips on form in the chest press movement that will help you to focus the work toward the pecs. Of course, in a pressing movement you cannot strictly isolate the chest, but these tips will help you to minimize the involvement of the shoulders and triceps and lats. To isolate as a bodybuilder would, you want to do the opposite of what a powerlifter does. Powerlifters try to recruit as many muscle groups as possible to move the most weight possible. Arching your back allows you to recruit your lats into the movement. To keep from using your back, keep it flat against the bench. If you have trouble doing this, raise your knees up and put your feet on the bench, and this will flatten the low back out. You can even lift your feet up and bring your knees toward your torso while doing the exercise. A narrow grip on the bar allows you to recruit your triceps. To keep your triceps involvement to a minimum widen your grip until your forearms are able to remain perpendicular to the ground through most of the movement. Slipping your shoulder blade out and Rolling your shoulder forward allows you to recruit your shoulder muscle more. To avoid this, you have to do two things. First, start each set by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Leave them together throughout the set, and keep your shoulder back. Do not push your shoulder forward as you extend your arm. The other thing you need to pay attention to is your elbow position. Your elbows should be tucked slightly toward your torso, more in line with your chest than your shoulder. This also keeps you from putting your rotators in a compromised position. Another technique you can use is to pre-exhaust the chest with an isolation movement (machine flyes) before the compound movement (bench press). Do not be concerned with the amount of weight you are lifting rather pay attention to whether you feel the pecs working. One exercise that is severely underutilized is dumbbell pullovers. Lie perpendicular to a bench with your rib cage supported by the bench, feet on the ground, and knees bent. You may slide down so that the edge of the bench supports part of your neck if you need to. Allow your hips to drop a few inches below your chest. Hold a dumbbell vertically by one end above your chest with arms extended. Move the dumbbell back over your face and toward the ground until your arms are parallel to the ground pivoting in the shoulder and keeping the elbows straight, then lift the dumbbell back to the starting position. The pullover targets the area of the chest that attach at the collarbone, highlighted in the second muscle picture. It also targets the pec minor, and the serratus. 

Usually the reason people mix protein powders is to have differing rates of absorption of protein within one meal. Whey is absorbed the fastest. Casein is absorbed the slowest. Egg and soy protein is absorbed at a rate between whey and caesin. Whey is ideal for post workout. Casein is used by some before bed to have protein available for recovery while fasting overnight, but this is not necessary for the average fitness enthusiast. Mixing proteins is thought to sustain you longer when using a protein shake as a meal replacement. 

In my opinion, there is nothing "beginner" about exercises in sets of 10 and explosive movements...even if it is only a 16 minute workout. When you train your body, you tear muscles so that your body can repair them in the time between workouts. It's great that you're not usually sore, because that leads me to believe that you are recovering properly. However, tendons and ligaments do not tend to strengthen and/or recover as quickly as muscle tissues, so when you do lots of explosive movements and low to moderate reps sets (as opposed to high rep sets), your muscles have the ability to keep up with the increasingly difficult workouts, but your connective tissues tend to lag behind. Under continued stress over time, you'll set yourself up for injury. You could be experiencing a soreness in the connective tissues that are beginning to wear down, and you really should switch your training to higher rep sets and elliminate explosive movements for a couple weeks and then transition back to your current training program and see if the pain persists. The vibrams are going to cause you to move in a way that your are not conditioned for, so there are going to be pains in one place one day and they'll move to another place the next. You can easily acrue an injury wearing them for the types of workouts you're doing if you make a cold turkey transition. You should treat this as if it were an injury. Take some ibuprofen, and ice both knees several times a day for 20 minutes. I'd back off of the rolling for a couple days too because it could contribute to inflammation while your body is trying to heal. Another thought (although from the area you're complaining about, I really don't think this is it) is that your glutes and/or piraformous are tight. It is not uncommon for tightness in the glutes to cause pain in the knee. In fact, any imbalance in flexibility between the quads, hamstrings, glutes, or hip flexors can cause pain in the knee. It's just most common that it's tightness somewhere in your butt. If this is the case, there are 2 stretches you should try. Sit on the floor with the right leg straight in front of you, and the left foot on the ground on the right side of the right knee. Wrap your right elbow around your left knee, and pull it toward the center of your chest. Repeat on other side. Sit in a chair with your right ankle on your left knee. Sit upright and lean the lower part of your rib cage down toward your right shin. 

You can probably increase your pace for the 3 and 4 mile legs, but hitting an 8 mile pace for the 7 mile leg I would consider and accomplishment. The fastest way to increase your conditioning and pace is to incorporate interval training into your runs. It can be done on a treadmill, but you should really get out and run outside if that's where you're race will be. Do some sprint intervals where you sprint 20-30 seconds every 2-5 minutes. Do some long intervals where you run a strong pace for 3-5 minutes every 10 minutes. Do hill intervals where you drive up the hill, then jog or walk back down. I suggest doing 3 of these types of workouts per week. Combine the interval workouts with with 2 easy runs per week, one paced long run for distance, and an off day. 

This is a completely different problem than that of your shoulder. If your left hip is clicking, your left knee and/or foot probably turn inward slightly which causes the left hip bone to drop a bit in the front. Any time you have a tightness in the hips and glute area, it creates an imbalance in the position of your pelvic bone. An imbalance or instability in the hips will cause other muscles in your hips to work harder to stabilize the area. The difference between this situation and your shoulder problem, is that your shoulder has long periods of rest throughout the day, whereas your hips only rest while you're prone. Simple daily activities are causing the problem to persist even though you are unaware of it until you exercise. You should see a chiropractor and have him/her x-ray your hips and show you the likely rotation that is is your pelvic area. They may suggest a treatment plan. Even if you choose not to go back for regular adjustments to address the problem, I still suggest that you go for an initial visit. This way you can understand what's going on. To fix the issue, you will need to relax the muscles that are encouraging the rotation in your hips, and you may find that you have pain in a new place that is the root of the problem. To relax the muscles, you should get regular massage. I suggest once a week in the beginning. Make sure that you find a massage therapist that does deep tissue work, and doesn't avoid the front hip area and glutes. That is where you'll need the most work, and some LMT's tend to work arms, legs, and back which isn't going to serve the purpose you need. It is also possible that there is no root of the problem, rather that you favor one leg strongly to the point that your habits have allowed muscles in a certain area to shorten and muscles in another area to lengthen. Added via edit... As for exercises to strengthen the hip...Without knowing the exact root of the problem, I can't really give specific exercises that would benefit your particular issue. I would say that any exercises that work your quads, glutes, hamstrings, abs, and low back would benefit you if done with light weight in sets of 20 or more followed by lots of stretching. These exercises could include but are not limited to squats, dead lifts, lunges, stiff legged dead lifts, hypertensions, and crunches. 

I would not suggest gaining that much weight in one month. You are not going to build more than 1 pound of muscle in one month which means you'll be gaining over 20 pounds in a month. That is very unhealthy! That type of weight gain will negatively effect your hormone levels...increasing your estrogen level, lowering your testosterone, and slowing your thyroid. It's a really bad idea. 

With any sport, repetitive motions can cause injury, so cross training is always a good idea as opposed to narrowing your training regimen by adding more boxing days. Weight training can be a good compliment to boxing. In the beginning, you may feel as though it interferes with your boxing due to soreness, but that should pass as you adjust. Plyometrics, olympic lifting, and/or kettle bell training may be an even better form of resistance training than standard weight training to add as part of your regimen. The explosive movements can help you to become faster and more agile in boxing. Maye sure that if you choose to take up this type of training that you have someone teach you proper form. Any type of endurance training can also be a great complement to boxing training, so running, biking, or swimming between boxing days is a good idea too. 

Okay...I have the answer. I'm a bodybuilder, so this is the kind of stuff we do... Do not lift heavy weights for large muscle groups. I will make you swell. Do not do a colon cleanse this close. It can make you hold water. However much water you drank on Sunday, do the same on Monday. Assuming you drank a gallon or more of water Sunday, Drink half of that on Tuesday before 6pm. After 6pm, only sip as needed totaling less than a pint between 6pm Tuesday and 12pm Wednesday. I'm assuming you're weighing in at 12pm Wednesday, so adjust accordingly. Stop eating all carbohydrates immediately, including fruit. Also stop any dairy products. Only eat protein and veggies with no sodium added. For protein, do not eat egg whites. I suggest ground turkey of ground beef. For veggies, I suggest asparagus because it is also a natural diuretic. As for exercise, just sweat as much as possible. Do not soak in a tub or hot tub. Dry sauna would be fine. On Tuesday and Wednesday, only shower very quickly...in and out. 

Most people would chalk this up to a lack of conditioning, but focusing on your breathing can help. Try breathing in your nose, and out your mouth. Also, time your breathing as some people described as exhaling on a certain foot. I always timed my breathing by inhaling for an even number of strides and exhaling for one. That means you'll exhale on the opposite foot each time. 

The first thing I would do is revisit proper form for your parkour workouts. You could be overusing your grip to compensate for weakness in your back or somewhere else. As for lifting, make sure you're split is such that you only lift each muscle group once a week. Before training you should stretch your forearms. There are 4 stretches. Extend one arm in front of you with your hand up and your palm facing away. Rotate your hand clockwise, and use the other hand to push it further around until you feel a stretch. Then, rotate your hand counter clockwise until you feel a stretch. Repeat on other side. Next, extend your arm out with your hand down and your palm facing you. Rotate your hand clockwise, and use the other hand to push it further around until you feel a stretch. Then, rotate your hand counter clockwise until you feel a stretch. Repeat on other side. After training, you should stretch again and ice your wrists every time. It sounds like you have a weakness more than an injury, so as for some type of wrist brace or support, there are pluses and minuses. The plus is obvious as you are taking some of the work away from your body which will alleviate some pain, and most importantly it will help protect you from possible injuries. The minus is that in supporting and taking some of the work away from your body, it also keeps it from opportunities to improve. This is the case with any support equipment like lifting belts and straps. You have to find a balance where you do not wear the support during easier movements that you know you do not have trouble with, but you do wear it at the most intense parts of your training. Maybe you don't really need a support during weight training except certain exercises, and maybe you want to wear a support during parkour where there may be impact or you may not have the opportunity to move in a slow and controlled manor all the time. Lastly, any time you have muscle soreness that won't seem to go away, you need to consider every opportunity for recovery and see if you're shorting yourself somewhere. Do you eat enough protein? Do you eat enough carbs? Do you eat healthy fats? Do you drink enough water? Do you get enough sleep? Oh...one more thought...in reference to it being your right wrist and left forearm. I think you might just have weak forearms, and you are allowing the extension of the range of motion in your right wrist to support your weakness to some degree which puts extra tension in the joint. Since you have several days when you cannot workout in a row, you should probably do forearm specific exercises on your non-workout days. That may allow your forearms to catch up.
