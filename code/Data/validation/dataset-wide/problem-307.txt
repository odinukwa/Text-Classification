Banks. You don't bring a tuck load of bottle caps to buy your house, you bring the seller of the house to the bank where your bottle caps are kept and with the help of the banker, transfer ownership of your bottle caps to the seller of the house. The banker is also happy to store a record of the transaction in case the ownership of the house is ever called into question. In fact, it's been years since you've actually laid eyes on your bottle caps. What if the bank doesn't actually have your caps anymore? Does it even matter? Maybe it doesn't matter. And BAM! you have a Fiat currency. 

Earth experiences pretty significant tidal forces, and it doesn't seem to affect habitability too much. The crust flexes, the oceans rush in and out, and we're fine. Some life actually relies on it. Io, a moon of Jupiter, experiences significant tidal flexing, enough to generate serious heat and geological activity. So, it seems entirely possible for tidal forces to be strong enough to effect habitability. Constant volcanoes filling the air with ash and toxic chemicals, serious earthquakes moving dirt around and preventing plants from taking hold. So, you're question really boils down to "How strong are the tidal forces experienced by horseshoe moons?" Which is a very difficult question. The strength of tidal force is mostly based on distance, and it can be very difficult to predict how close these moons get to each-other. To get extremely close together, they would have a large difference between the innermost and outermost radius of their orbits. They would approach each other at a higher velocity. They would swap quickly. They would repeat their swaps more often. (relatively, we're still looking at several orbits to complete the swap and several hundred orbits between swaps) A horseshoe orbit that never gets very close is pretty much the same thing, but slower. The two moons are always close to the same distance from the planet. The swap places at a greater distance from each other. Since they interact with each other more weakly, the swap takes longer. It might be tens of thousands of orbits between swaps. tldr; It can probably be whatever you want, but the details are hard. 

There are scenarios where it can work without changing the history: transport aluminium spoons and crowns, get back the DNA of Michelangelo and Nero - insert a passage of Newton being nagged by a microrobotic mosquito probe; or just fingerprints of past celebrities for collectors. Speaking of DNA samples of the past: how about female/gynoid agents seducing and collecting genuine reproductive genetic material for those willing to pay enough to have a child of a male celebrity of the history? (maybe it can work for ova as well?) Any ethical conflicts for a story here? On the line of just the empty vanity of the customers, the children are missing the "nurture" side to realize the potential of the "nature"? 

In between, various other scenarios - regular pulses being improbable, though not impossible - e.g. still happen if the "cloud" is instead a "galactic stream of cosmic dust - after repulsing a "wave" by a gamma burst, the stream renews the density of the cloud with other incoming matter. 

See also: Herbig-Haro objects - protostars for which the accretion disk falling into the forming stars ionizes and the created magnetic field ejects polar jets at "supersonic" speeds. Those jets collide with the surrounding nebula and produces EM emission in visible spectrum (recombination and bow shocks) without the corresponding (for a mature star) IR part of the spectrum. How's the above relevant? Well, astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics is complex enough to allow a pulsating phenomenon (caused by the described configuration) to actually occur in the right conditions. It is also conveniently complex enough to allow for quite a fair bit of plausible hand-waving; feel free to do it I don't think someone will jump to say: "No, that's impossible", especially after accepting the presence of an anti-matter planet. To asses the safety of handwaving, a google search for "pulsating bow shock" brings in something like: 

A neonatologist (doctor who cares for newborns) I talked to recently pointed out that a larger percentage of babies need serious medical care after being born. This change came about about a generation after some serious improvement in the way we care for premature and sick babies in the 70s and 80s. He concludes that the genes that make it impossible to give birth without the help of advanced medical infrastructure are already spreading in our society. If you take this doctor's assertions to the (possibly ridiculous) extreme, you might imagine a race of highly advanced being with no reproductive organs at all who are only capable of reproducing by combining genetic material in a lab. You and your partner both swab your cheeks, pay the fee, and in nine months the lab calls you in to make you parents. 

Or Flat Jupiters, maybe. I'm imagining a space station with a large population orbiting very close to a gas giant. The horizon stretches away in all directions and an infinite variety of cloud patterns wiz by below. Some individuals get it in their head that they are flying over an infinite flat plane rather than going around an impossibly large sphere. Assume that, like modern Flat Earthers, they reject information from authorities outside of their social circles and measurements from equipment they can't use themselves. These people also wont or can't (perhaps for economic reasons) leave the space station to view the planetary system from a different vantage point. Is there something about their situation aboard the station that would make it plainly obvious that the planet they orbit is spherical and prevent this idea from spreading? 

Filters will never fix this problem. The problem is getting oxygen into your blood. Humans can live down to about 40% of sea level pressure. (356 millibars) That's called the Death Zone in mountain climbing. (~8000m on earth). With an oxygen mask, you can survive down to the Armstrong limit, at about 6% of sea level (47 millibars). So, your medieval civilization needs to produce pure oxygen, bottle it and distribute it. That does not sound like medieval technology. Maybe someone with modern understanding of chemistry would be able to do it with medieval tools, but I would still call that modern technology. 

Others have contributed good thoughts about the efficiency benefits of a small number of large reactors. Those points are valid and I think you should take heed of them. I'd just like to contribute a point which heads the other way, as much as anything because I think it might make for some interesting plot devices for your story. I have no direct knowledge of fusion reactors, but I did work for a while with the largest (by physical dimensions, not power output) nuclear Fission reactors ever made. An interesting property of physically large reactors is that controlling the reaction becomes harder compared to smaller units. Neutron propagation time across the core becomes significant, so they don't respond to control inputs as quickly as small reactors do. Now I'm not even sure if this transfers to fusion reactors as they are quite different beasts, but if we suppose for a moment that it does, it seems to me that the following might be true 

lots of good answers already, but there's one no one seems to have mentioned which, coming from the UK, was the first one I thought of. Say you overcome all the problems everyone has mentioned and build your mega-dome surrounding your city. It's great, your city is now completely immune to all natural disasters and adverse weather from a light dusting of snow to a mega-tsunami. As a result, everyone wants to live in your city. Your population increases, you look to build more houses, flats, etc and......oh. Your dome is full, your city can't expand without doing the whole mega-project over again. For examples of something like this which has happened, look at every European city dating back to medieval times. They all had walls once, to defend against barbarian hoards. Look where the walls are now, they certainly aren't outside the city anymore. Come to think of it, since this is WB, that might make a good basis for a story in your world. What happens when the city expands/wants to expand too far?
