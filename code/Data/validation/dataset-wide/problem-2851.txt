Now the why of the valuation could be anything. It could be a utilitarian calculation. It could be Singer's pain minimization view. It could be religious. It could be spiritual but not religious. It could be Kantian. It could be intuitionalist. It could be purely economic. Depending on the reasoning, it might be acceptable to kill of the last two hawks to save millions of momonga. Say for instance, if your preference is the cuteness of the animal or its relative intelligence. Alternately, you might consider some species to have prices and others to have worth but not price. (I for instance place the price of mold at about 200 yen). 

I think there are two errors or at least ellipses that need to be solved to make the critique forceful. First, before (C1), it does not specifically matter that a subject experiences mental states that that subject does not perceive and which are part of the social ontology. Or to restate it, I don't think Searle commits himself to a universal perception thesis regarding ontologically subjective social reality. It is possible for one or more subjects not to perceive such a state without eviscerating the existence of the state. The second gap seems to me to be between (C1) and (C2). There the problem appears to me that Searle is protected through his definition of social reality. If social is by definition something ontologically subjective, then the discovery of some mental state merely would indicate that state is not part of the social reality. To give this second conclusion force, you would need to prove that social reality is an empty category. And all states lie outside of it. I don't take (at least on my brief reading) the interpretation that Searle believes all of our reality is social reality, so proving one thing is not social reality is not enough. You either need to prove something that appears as the quintessential case of social reality is no ontologically subjective or that there are no such cases where something is social reality or that they are so rare that we should ignore them. 

Where they differ is that one regards the negation and the other assertion, and one is first-personal and the other third. 

Where he differs from Descartes is in what is called the "Copernican revolution" whereby he looks at our understanding in a different way that hints at a cognitive faculty that has power over the world that we perceive. (note that the domain of its power is the "world" which here refers to a concept in the mind). Basically, Kant turns to the mind in a different way than Descartes -- informed by and accepting Hume. Kant evades in part the question of how the moral self can interact with the world by making claims about the moral self that take it out of the world of our perception -- i.e., what we see is phenomenal, what we are as free creatures is noumenal. How the two meet is also beyond our ability to know, because knowing is the application of forms and categories to things (and we cannot know the things directly). 

There's a lot of bits in the question that are written with apparent certainty that appear to be idiosyncratic. I don't follow your vocabulary, so I'm going to ignore that and just give a general answer. The general answer across contemporary philosophical schools is that having an impression and attending to that impression are distinct. In most schools, they are also viewed as possibly different, but much of the difference hinges on what precisely is meant by "having" vs. "attending to". Probably, the clearest version of this is going to be in Husserl's phenomenology. But the basic idea is that consciousness is consciousness of, i.e., it is the directing of my attention towards an object whether that object be in the world or in my own mind. So then we can distinguish between: 

I wouldn't say there are "widely accepted (precise) definitions" for the two terms you mention. I would say there are several different well-known accounts that deal with relationship. The first one I would recommend is from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. For Aristotle, the end goal of life is eudaimonia -- a word that can and has been translated as "happiness." At the same time, this happiness also refers to a certain form of flourishing. Thus, Aristotle takes pain to explain that this is not identical to happiness nor is it necessarily identical to what agents take pleasure in. Instead pleasure/pain are signals that operate correctly in the virtuous person (evil pains them; good gives them pleasure), but that operate poorly in lesser mortals (where evil sometimes gives them pleasure; good sometimes gives them pain). The first part of this argument is BooK I. The concern with pleasure/pain happens in Book II. (I've written a little bit on this and continue to do so, but for more famous considerations, I would suggest consulting J.L. Ackrill's brief primer on Aristotle). In terms of other accounts, we can also see differing treatments in the Epicurean philosophy and in the Stoics. For the Stoics, pain and pleasure signal nothing about morality except insofar as experiencing any negative feeling due to one's circumstances reflects a character that lacks ataraxia. Conversely, the Epicureans sought to optimize pleasure in their lives. Moving towards more contemporary thought, the Stoic and Epicurean positions recur as the Kantian and Millean accounts. In John Stuart Mill's account, pleasure and happiness occur as synonyms. For Kant, happiness (in its rational form) is good, but otherwise the pursuit of pleasure is a sign of moral failing (see for instance his treatment of sex in the Metaphysics of Morals). There's a decent amount of contemporary literature on the subject -- centered on what is required for people to be happy. But "happiness" is generally called "well-being" instead in the contemporary literature to avoid self-helpers molesting the research. I believe a large part of the impetus is Derek Parfit. I can recommend at least two authors in this arena. Chris Rice who writes about objective list theories and Christopher Gowans who is also working on well-being. Objective list theories propose that people are happy (have well-being) when they have some or all of the goods on an objective list. This stands in contrast to subjective theorists who maintain that happiness is had in having what one wants. 

This is an interesting but also very complex question. On the simplest level, my answer is no for most of your list (specifically, to which I might add ethics, social philosophy, every era in the history of philosophy). Instead, these are the things that people research rather than techniques used for doing research. is a hard one depending on what is meant by the term. By and large, contemporary philosophers will associate this with Hegel's philosophical method or with Marx's -- both of which are (largely though not universally) despised by the majority of philosophers. is for most philosophers a key part of their tool kit. Here, this should be taken to mean sentential logic, categorical logic, analogies, and (to differing degrees) modal logic. (For those who specifically study logic or philosophy of math as an area of research -- I believe we had one researcher who answered a few questions here for a bit -- the may also study more esoteric things like tri-valued logics or deontic logic which are not a part of the universal toolkit). Having given the answer, no, I should explain several ways that this could prove to be an inadequate answer. First, I'm working from my experience plus how I've seen other philosophers work. I can think of four types of philosophers I've encountered: contemporary analytics, contemporary continentals, historical figures or periods - translation / exposition, and historical figures or periods - comparative. For all categories, a major component of research is reading. Maybe it might be easiest to start with the last two categories in terms of how the research process works. For historical translation / exposition philosophers, a good deal of what they do is read texts in the original language, provide translations, and argue about interpretations of the arguments. For historical comparative philosophers, they work with historical texts and contemporary texts to suggest either contemporary solutions to historical problems or historical solutions to contemporary problems (there's a good deal of variation where you could replace "solution" and "problem"). They key thing that makes this philosophy rather than history is that they are focused on offering arguments. For contemporary analytics, most of their reading is going to be contemporary, and comparatively, they will have taken more logic. Also, some of them are going to need to be up to speed on research in other fields -- like neuroscience, chemistry, or psychology. The point is that they are offering arguments using logic and analogies to support positions on issues that matter to them. Contemporary continentals sometimes do research like historical philosophers do. Others have what at least to me looks like a religious interest in some contemporary philosopher (for instance Judith Butler or Julia Kristeva or Martin Heidegger) where they mostly argue with others in their sub-discipline about interpretations or implementations. All of that being said, people who write about ethics, social philosophy, aesthetics, or other similar things may often also include metaphysics/epistemology/etc as tools. As in they may give an account of art based on Kant's ideas in epistemology and art. Or they may give an account of morality building on Aristotle's account of human persons. The same pattern can also happen with epistemologists building on preferred metaphysics and then metaphysics people building on more fundamental metaphysics and logic. But it's also possible that they are positing something that is simultaneously metaphysics and epistemology rather than using any of these as a tool. Others may have a different account of the sort of methods professional philosophers undertake... If so, I'll gladly defer to clearer accounts of how this works. 

Sure, but what does reason mean here? Is it a pure synonym for "logical analysis"? If so, then what justifies that choice? Can logical analysis itself justify itself? (your dictionary definition suffers from the same ambiguity. 

Because the negation of this or the loss of this seems to be problematic to universalize (assuming we ignore Hegel's critique that whether or not we have a system of transactions and property is a priori arbitrary). It does not guarantee success but Kant's morality is never about the guarantee of success. It's about the purity of the act of willing such that its accords with pure reason. Suggested References 

Er, I think there's several ways to answer this, but I'm going to give two thoughts that might help organize it for you. First, there's a problem with the sentence you wrote about negation: 

Your usage with your debate captain seems to be a version of 2. But there's an important problem in the formulation you gave and the formulation for 2, which is that "the good" is not defined. There's a lot of different species of consequentialism that focus on different things. If we define the good as "maximizing perceived positive impact on society", then you seem to be correct. I don't know how your debate captain is defining the good -- perhaps "the maximization of life." 

It's absolutely possible to prove both. I don't know your set of inference rules, so I'm going to make it easy for me by including material implication to solve the second one and to just let things follow directly from a contradiction for the first: 

I took Kripke to be saying that we can rigidly designate something, and we can rigidly designate anything precisely when we pick that thing out across all possible worlds. See $URL$ 

First off, I want to say this is a really good question that reflects real thought on an interpretative issue in Kant studies. Second, I think you're grasping some major things but also thinking backwards (by which I mean imposing contemporary categories on what Kant is doing). In terms of your question, one major issue is going to be where in Kant you are reading. The account you are giving sounds closest to the Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft). There, I take Kant's position to be as follows: 

The particular quote you're supplying does not explain why persons should be considered to have worth. While in the above, I've given Kant's account, there are many others. Another answer mentions Buber who also things persons have worth not price. Buber's justification is different from Kant. For Kant, we have worth due to being possessors of reason. For Buber, we have worth with respect to others, because we are for them a Thou. You can get a similar idea in Levinas as to Buber in which case all others are Other to us and above us in worth. One further possible route could be the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Or Kierkegaard's account of the "love your neighbor command" 

read a whole lot notice something interesting in primary literature focus in on secondary literature to see if I've got something interesting to say compile the paper revise and refine its arguments submit, rinse, repeat 

I could probably write more ... but it's been 8 years since I've read Kripke, and I'm not quite sure where you're going with this. Or to word it another way in answer to your title question, everything could have a rigid designator if anyone bothered to assign one to it, which often happens in the form of a name that is given to pick it out in all possible worlds from the privileged location of this world. 

The hedonist says we just need to value enjoyment and not waste our time thinking / having values. aha! the hedonist is thinking / has a value. Ergo, the hedonist has a self-referentially incoherent view. 

This is because the formal system is such that building on a small set of operators, we can prove either through truth tables, truth trees, or inference rules that any time an argument is formally valid that were the premises to be true, the conclusion would also have to be true. In a sense, this is more certain than "If I see a light bulb producing light, then there must be electricity flowing through it" because it is an abstraction such that by rule it will work. 

Early analytic philosophy did reject "metaphysics." But it's important to understand why they would be motivated to do so. The answer for English-speaking ones is the Oxford Hegelians. In other words, Hegel (or at least an interpretation of it) was the dominant philosophy in the English-speaking world in the 19th century. One of the humorous details of how this all works out is that McTaggart, now remembered for A-theory and B-theory of time was actually a Hegelian who rejected both in favor of C-theory: that time is an illusion. More generally, these philosophers were arguing against a background of highly convoluted philosophy in general. The project of metaphysics and epistemology in their modern forms (here modern as opposed to contemporary) was largely getting out of hand to the point where there are dogmatic competing systems that seem broken. Thus, two main responses evolved: positivism, etc., that rejected metaphysics and phenomenology that side-stepped epistemological questions. The rejection of this sort of idea of metaphysics by Russell is equally forceful with the later rejections by the logical positivists (though it must be admitted he accepts metaphysics under certain definitions). I don't have specific data on Moore and Frege. But my sense is that Moore's project in ethics is compatible with a denial of metaphysics but does not require it. 

Natural rights and human rights originally come from different vocabularies. It's not fair to construe natural rights as "simply a less developed and more concise version of what we now consider human rights." First, I want to start by pointing out an important but crucial ambiguity in the term "natural rights." Viz., the problem is that "nature" can mean many things. Thus, one meaning of natural rights are those rights granted to an individual by Nature (though in naturalized versions not capitalized); another meaning is those rights granted to a person as a result of their nature. Thus, the US Declaration of Independence speaks of natural rights as those granted by the Creator in making humans the way they are. The second meaning of natural right could be stated in saying people have rights to food, community, and procreation, because these follow from human nature. The senses are somewhat integrated in that most rights granted by Nature (as God, Nature, nature) are generally presumed to accrue as consequences of the sort of creatures that are made. To make it simpler with an analogy, if God declares we have the right to free tacos, then this would be natural in the first but not the second sense, but if God makes us so that we need food, then we may have a natural right in the second sense to the provision of food [thought not necessarily tacos]. Human rights can differ from both of these senses or overlap. Here, the adjective identifies those things which accrue to humans (an objective genitive) rather than those things that follow from being human. Thus, any right that we think people deserve and/or we grant to people is a human right if we grant it to them because they are human. To give an example, the UN declares that all humans have the right to a country of citizenship. This can be understood in one of two ways. Either you could believe this follows from the nature of human beings and is thus a human right we should recognize or you believe that this is a right we have given humans by legal force and thus becomes a human right. Again, we can return to our example. If the UN council passes a bill saying we deserve free tacos, then we have a human right to free tacos in those places where UN pronouncements mean something. The UN might argue that these rights follow logically from what we are in which case they are claiming a natural right-basis for this human right or rather that they are merely pronouncing an already existing natural right and codifying it. We can now return to the sense in which you viewed human rights as progress over natural rights. This is definitely there in the literature. But this does not mean human rights are necessarily better. What it means is that our idea of rights has shifted. When rights talk first takes off in the natural rights form, it is seen as the perception of a pre-existing right inherent in nature (in the second sense) or a right God/Nature has woven into the fabric of existence (first and second senses together). Human rights talk can also include positive rights -- rights that exist only because we've decreed that they do. But with this comes the critiques. Human rights can wind up being arbitrary precisely insofar as they are not necessarily grounded in nature. They also tend to be revocable or if rights with no basis are granted, deleterious to a society. Moreover, this type of rights talk requires a certain Western type of legal system. Thus, we see many critiques from Chinese philosophy (see Confucian Ethics: A Comparative Study of Self, Autonomy, and Community and the work of Theodore de Bary) and from Western communitarians (e.g. Alasdair MacIntyre) and from feminists sand others.
