This method would work, almost without doubt, on humans. There would always be some doubt in their minds as to whether the universe was real, so they would probably not kill everything. Probably. Now, consider AI. What is AI? Code. So, if your AI doesn't have sensors, yes, this method works. It can't sense its environment (and more importantly can't affect it), as it's just code on a hard disk, perhaps with a keyboard and monitor attached). You start to have problems when the AI is linked to sensors and effectors. One wrong move and it'll know you're lying; then it might never believe you again and go on a killing spree (though you might want to see Dan's answer for reasons why it wouldn't). For example, if you kick the box and it senses some more light, it knows there's something outside the "universe" causing that. If someone walks by it and casts it into shade, the same thing. Once it has effectors and sensors, it can not only tell it's not in the real universe, it can do something about it - like get out of the box and thump you. 

Get artistic. Hire an artist. Get them to draw, in perspective, a projected map of the city. It'll end up looking sort of like an isometric projection (as in Samuel's answer), but with sufficient detail, you can show passages going over and under one another, and coming out in the right places. Combine this with cutting away walls and/or ceilings to show the insides of caverns and the like (so you can see the connections), and you've got yourself a map. Use contours. Like on real-world maps, use lines that designate a height. Have one line be 0 feet elevation, the next -10f, -20f, -30f etc. They should be drawn in a conspicuous color, and should go over the parts of the underground network that are at that height. Combine the two. Take your isometric artistic project from the first point, combine it with contours from the second, and you'll have an easy to understand map of the underground which clearly demarcates the elevations it's all built at. 

You've touched on the major points already: vitamins and skin colour. They are linked to an extent. Vitamin D is the major vitamin we get from sunlight. It's partly a "happy vitamin" in that it provokes serotonin neurotic responses, which makes you happier (have a look over at Biology.SE for more details on this response). So, one big problem you'd have is higher depression rates (and at risk of being a bit more morbid, higher suicide rates). You would, however, find that light-skinned people suffer less: they are capable of producing vitamin D through UV-B exposure faster. On that note, bring the tanning beds underground with you. Melanin is a pigment found in hair and skin. It is the chemical that determines your skin colour. It appears to be an adaptation to sunlight. This is why, generally, people who live by the equator have darker skin. When underground, this chemical would be needed far far less, so you would find that over time and several tens of cycles of macroevolution, most people are fair-skinned. Depending on the conditions underground, you may also find people's senses altering. Moles, for example, live their entire life underground and have almost no sense of vision, despite having binocular eyes. If the underground homes that humans now live in are dark, you will find that through both adaptation and evolution, they de-evolve having such good vision. You can find better definitions for micro and macro evolution on Biology.SE, but in general terms: 

Method 1: Change the development order One very simple way to ensure a canal has a very long lifespan is to change the order of development so that railways aren't developed until long after canals. This does, after all, make sense: it is easy to see how the sea could be 'extended' to form a canal, but railways are far more complex. In our world, canals did actually come first - there are some examples in the comments - but railways (at least in this country) were popularised not long after canals were. Method 2: Make it hard for railways The other way to do this is just to make it hard or not economically viable to build a railway. If, for example, the nearest railway is 150 miles away and the nearest canal is just 10, it's pretty obvious which you're going to build - especially if the costs of a railway are higher. This is not to say that railways wouldn't make it to that area eventually, but it would be a much longer time and canals would have been around much longer. 

Those are more luxury implants. On the other side, I can see a lot of uses for technologies like this in medicine. Nanobots With nanotechnology, you can create healing nanobots. Having these circulating in your bloodstream means your chances of dying from injury are suddenly much lower. 

In my world, the humans left Earth a few centuries ago because it was too heavily polluted with chemical smog. They've settled a new planet and have so far managed to keep it clean. However, they are looking to restore the Earth and conduct periodic checks on its health and the state of the chemical pollution. The current situation is this. The last check on Earth revealed that the chemical pollution is now negligible. So, the humans filled up a spacecraft with supplies, a team of 10, and enough fuel to get to Earth. However, these astronauts get there, land, and soon discover that they're not safe: although the chemical pollution is less potent, one of their number drops dead after a few days from chemical poisoning. The chemical smog is a mixture of a few chemicals: primarily carbon monoxide, with some vaporised phosgene and (just for variety) some LPS. The question now is how the remaining 9 could survive until their rescue ship arrives in a years' time, given a 5-4 split of women to men and anything from the 21st century that might have survived on Earth. Assume they know their way around and have enough skilled people that they can use any method of transport; additionally, they have brought a 21st century nuclear fission reactor with them for power. Their ship can support them for 5 days each month before the oxygen runs out and needs to recharge. What methods could they use to avoid chemical poisoning? 

You've got a good setup for your little group, so you can now try to make contact with other groups of survivors. There might be one 2 miles over the hill; your explorers should find them. Any lost souls you find, you can take in: you should have some surplus food and water, and it strengthens your group. 6. Start Building This should now be several years down the line, where you have food, water and materials stored up. You can now start building: homes for people, storerooms so your cave and homes aren't so cramped. As you get new materials in, invest them in building to last - you want what you build to survive as long as possible so you don't have to expend materials repairing it. 7. Start Innovating This is even more years down the line. You should have a permanent camp set up and teams going out every day to get food, water and materials. Set up another team or few at camp to start making things that might be useful for you: 

Emphasis mine. People would pick holes in the proof. Both atheists and believers of other religions would nitpick and find holes that - while not THGTTG-style excessive - still "prove" that the proof is wrong. The "proof denies faith" argument is a fairly strong one: if someone claims to have proved the existence of a god, someone else can claim that the basis of their proof was something put into the universe by the real God to see how humans would react to it. There are other people who are just plain stubborn and will point-blank refuse to believe that the new proof is valid. This has happened with many other important scientific discoveries: perhaps most relevant is the discovery that the Earth revolves around the Sun not the other way round. The discoverer of this theory was placed under house arrest due to the Church's demand for heresy; they didn't like how his idea went against what they'd thought for centuries. 

And life continued such for a while. People traded things they had for things they wanted. But the problem was sometimes the person who had the thing you wanted didn't want the thing you had. And so the goldsmith comes along. 

So how are they getting global recognition as a joint Union? This situation is far more likely to lead to other countries viewing them as separate countries. And, to expand on a comment made, without national law how do they govern the use of the military? Instead they would have to call a conference every time they want to use it, and by the time that's over there'll be no point, the situation may well have gone. 

This method seems a bit extreme... if you want to destroy Earth's politics but keep their culture, there are far easier methods. However, some solutions anyway: Nova Bombs In Andromeda, all Commonwealth warships carry Nova Bombs. These are bombs powerful enough to cause a star to nova by negating its own gravity, thus causing a nova due to the pressure and a lack of gravity containing it. According to the wiki, this nova causes an explosion of hydrogen undergoing fusion, which obliterates everything in its path, destroying the entire solar system. There is a theoretical way to do this, using a rotating ceramic disc above powerful electromagnets, although whether it could be done on stellar scale is doubtful. Scaling down... Planetary Destruction There are plenty of fictional weapons capable of destroying entire planets, most notably in the Star Trek series. For example, the Xindi superweapon was a directed energy beam capable of collapsing entire planets. However, my personal favourite idea for destroying planets is a Doomsday device, which would kill all life and render the planet uninhabitable for a few centuries at least, but it leaves the option to re-settle the planet later. Keeping Culture Alive If you want to keep Earth's cultures, you need their people. There's no doubt about that. So perhaps you should take a few (say 5) people of each culture you want from Earth to survive the annihilation and come with you. You could even select these people by posing as a human for a few years and running a high-tech selection program on Earth's inhabitants. 

The point of telling that story was this: money is actually a promise. A promise that if you take your paper to the bank, they will give you its value in gold. Technically. (It won't work in practice, I don't advise trying.) And originally, it was a promise from a banker to give back whatever it was you gave them to keep safe. So my answer is this: paper. More specifically, bits of recognizable, fraud-safe bits of paper with promises on them, promises from a Universe Bank to give back whatever they've been given for safekeeping. The Bank would also be the entity that sets the value of each type of planetary currency. It's a bit like the money we already have. 

N.B.: All these figures require that the force is applied in a non-axial plane. Applying the force directly to the top of their head won't work, as it will all transfer down the spine and spread across the body like it's meant to. You need to effectively push sideways. 

I hate to spoil this one, but Bill Gates likely won't exist after this thing hits the earth. As Jimmy360's answer says, if the spear truly is a projectile, it will hit the Earth at Mach 29. That impact will cause: 

It would not discourage oceanic shipping, but it would make the times it can be done more selective. If you have a port that is 20m deep and full at high tide, with our Moon you should still have at least 10m left at low tide (depending on the tides in that area). That's plenty to operate big ships in. If your Moon is closer and your tides bigger, your 20m harbor might be empty at low tide. This means ship captains need to plan more accurately: they need to be in and out of a harbor this shallow within a couple of hours. Delays in voyages would lead to big delays at the destination waiting for the next tide. The alternative is that harbors are built bigger, which costs a lot more in both money and time. 

As for the effects of the enchantments, this is impossible to define within the boundaries of science. However, since your magic does not operate on a closed system, it makes it a touch easier, so the basic principle goes like this:
