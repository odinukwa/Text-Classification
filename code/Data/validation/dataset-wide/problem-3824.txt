Let $G$ be a discrete group and let $S$ be a generating set for $G$; assume that $S$ is symmetric (i.e., $g\in S$ iff $g^{-1}\in S$). Let $L=L_S=\frac{1}{|S|}(\sum_{g\in S} g-1)$ be an element of the group algebra. For $F\in \ell^p(G)$ and $g,h\in G$ let $\lambda_p(g) F$ be defined by $\lambda_p(g) F (h) = F(hg^{-1})$; this is the regular representation of $G$ on $\ell^p(G)$. Finally let $L_p = \pi_p(L)$. It is a classical result of Kesten that $G$ is non-amenable iff $L_2$ has a bounded inverse (i.e., $0$ is not in the spectrum of $L_2$). What is known in the case of $p=1$? Clearly if $G$ is amenable, then there are functions $f_n\in \ell^1(G)$ with the property that $\Vert L_1 f_n \Vert_1 / \Vert f_n \Vert_1 \to 0$ showing that $0$ is in the spectrum of $L_1$ and so $L_1$ is not invertible. Also, if $G$ is not amenable, then such $f_n$ cannot exist under the additional assumption that $f_n\geq 0$. Given $G$ non-amenable, can one find a generating set $S$ with the property that $L_1$ is invertible? 

It may be easier to understand what is going on if you interpret your character $\tau$ in a different way. Let us examine the argument for why amenability of $\Gamma$ implies existence of a character $\tau : C_r(\Gamma)\to \mathbb{C}$ (which I will call $\epsilon$ from now on to avoid confusion with the group trace). Now, extension of the trivial representation $\epsilon : \mathbb{C}\Gamma$ to $C^*_r(\Gamma)$ exists iff $$|\epsilon(x)| \leq \Vert x\Vert_\min\qquad(*)$$ for any $x\in \mathbb{C}\Gamma$, where $\Vert x\Vert_\min = \Vert \lambda(x)\Vert_{B(\ell^2\Gamma)}=\Vert x\Vert_{C^*_r\Gamma}.$ Indeed, if the character does extend, the extension is unital and thus must have norm $1$; and if the inequality holds, then $\epsilon$ extends by continuity. The inequality $(*)$ is equivalent to amenability (use weak containment of the trivial representation in the left regular representation for one direction, and the spectral radius characterization for the opposite direction). If you consider $C^*\Gamma$ instead of $C^*_r\Gamma$, the question of whether $\epsilon$ extends to all of $C^*\Gamma$ once again has to do with a similar inequality: $|\epsilon(x) | \leq \Vert x\Vert_{C^*\Gamma}$. However, the latter inequality is always true (by definition of the full $C^*$ norm). 

Isn't the point that human reason is generally frail altogether, especially when making conclusions by using long serial chains of arguments? So in mathematics where such extended arguments are routine, we want their soundness to be as close to ideal as possible. Of course, even generally accepted proofs are occasionally later seen to be lacking, but to give up proofs as the ideal changes the very nature of mathematics. I heard that the example of parts of the Italian school of algebraic geometry of the 19th century was an important example of this overextension of intuition. Furthermore, it is only in the attempt at proof that the real nature of the reasons why a statement is true are finally exposed. So the reformulation and refoundation of algebraic geometry in the 20th century is said to have exposed revolutionary new ways of seeing mathematics in general. Finally, it is only by proof that the limits of applicability of a theorem are really understood. This comes into play many times in physics, say where some "no-go theorem" is elided because its assumptions are not valid in some new realm. 

a. Euler's computation of Zeta(2), (at first with only very weak, handwaving, or no convergence arguments), as redacted in Polya or here. Obviously amazingly ingenious, and interesting for artists, connecting numbers and circles. Requires unerstanding that a polynomial is equal to the product of its first degree factors, possibly it is too well known, however. It also allows one to then revisit the convergence argument and show what mathematicians actually worry about, after the "flash of ingenuity" b. A lovely agument I heard a long time ago on sci.math relating to Sagan's book "Contact" in which a message is encoded in the bits of Pi. Someone asked whether a deity could arrange for Pi to be a different real number. Opinions went back and forth relating to spacetime, etc. Then someone asked, in light of any of the familiar series expansions, "If Pi were different, which natural number would be missing or duplicated, and how might that be?" Leads to a discussion of the Peano axioms. Everyone goes home wondering. :-) 

Recently Malliaris and Shelah (see their preprint $URL$ have shown that theories with $SOP_2$ are maximal in the Keisler order. A preceding result of Shelah shows that theories with $SOP$ are maximal in this order: specifically Shelah in his book on classification theories gives a proof that the theory of $(\mathbb{Q},<)$ is maximal in Keisler order on theories. Is there another reference source where to look at this proof? Recall that $T_1\leq T_2$ in Keisler order if whenever $G$ is a regular ultrafilter on $\lambda$, $M_i$ is model of $T_i$, and $M_2$ is such that $Ult(M_2,G)$ is $\lambda^+$-saturated, then also $Ult(M_1,G)$ is $\lambda^+$-saturated. Keisler showed that this relation defines indeed an order on theories (i.e. it is transitive and reflexive) and gave a set theoretic characterization of the maximal theories in terms of the combinatorial properties of the ultrafilters which saturate them (which are the good ultrafilters). There is still much work to do to understand the model theoretic properties of this order and Malliaris and Shelah's result is one of the recent most significant advances in this area. However it is not so easy to find in the literature a variety of results regarding the properties of this order. Any bibliographic indication on these matters is very welcome. 

Suppose $\langle P_\alpha,\dot{Q}_\alpha:\alpha\leq\omega_1\rangle$ is a full support iteration of (semi)proper forcings. Is the full limit $P_{\omega_1}$ (semi)proper or at least stationary set preserving? 

The question may be trivial, but has eluded me, may be it is more appropriate for mathstack-exchange. Let $B$, $C$ be boolean algebras and $i:B\to C$ be an homomorphism. By Stone duality to each such $i$ corresponds a continuos map $\pi:St(C)\to St(B)$ defined by $G\mapsto i^{-1}[G]$ for any $G$ ultrafilter on $B$ (where $St(B)$ is the compact $0$-dimensional space of ultrafilters on $B$ with topology given by the base of clopen sets $N_c$ given by ultrafilters to which $c$ belongs, as $c$ ranges in $B$). It is easy to check that if $\pi$ is open then $i$ is a complete homomorphism (i.e. it preserves arbitrary suprema whenever they exist in $B$). Does the converse always hold? The converse holds in case $\pi$ induces an order preserving map $\pi^*:C\to B$ defined by $N_{\pi^*(c)}=\pi[N_c]$ for all $c\in C$, which occurs for example if $B$ is a complete boolean algebra. What if $B$ is not complete and $i$ is complete? In this case I'm stuck. Here is a sketch of the easy implication and of the partial converse: (1) Assume $i$ is not complete. Let $D$ be a predense subset of $B$ such that $i[D]$ is not predense in $C$. Fix $c\in C$ such that $c\wedge i(d)=0$ for all $d\in D$. Then $A=\bigcup_{d\in D} N_d$ is a dense open subset of $St(B)$ and $\pi[N_c]\cap A=\emptyset$. Since $St(B)\setminus A$ is closed nowhere dense, this gives that $\pi[N_c]$ is closed (since $St(B)$ is compact Hausdorff) and nowhere dense, hence it is not open. (2) It suffices to show that $\pi[N_c]$ is clopen for all $c\in C$. Let $A=\{b\in B: i(b)\wedge c=0\}$. By completeness of $B$, $\bigvee A=d$ exists, and by completeness of $i$, $i(d)\wedge c=0$. It is not hard to check that $\pi[N_c]=N_{\neg d}$ (since $G\not\in \pi[N_c]$ if and only if $G\cap A$ is non-empty). 

Suppose we call a knot an equivalence class of embeddings of S1 --> R3 under ambient isotopy, a knot representative a particular such embedding, and a knot diagram the "2 1/2 dimensional" shadow of such a knot representative on S2 from a particular vantage point P, i.e. the light source for the shadow is at P, and the "2 1/2" means that the over and under information is shown. My question involves how the set of knot diagrams of a particular fixed knot representative vary as P, the viewpoint varies. We know about the Reidemeister rules, which generate a group of transformations of knot diagrams in a way such that the underlying knot remains invariant under changes of both ambient isotopy and projection. Intuitively there is also a smaller group of pure "projective" transformations of knot diagrams under which any fixed knot representative remains invariant. Assuming that, what are the relations between these two groups of transformations of knot diagrams? 

How to form your own math circle or some other teaching movies, especially with kids solving problems and having fun at it. I mentioned this in a comment, but it could use elaboration and advertisement. Museums are for people, especially kids. One goal is to empower kids to feel they can think. Some sort of exhibits on what really good mathematics teaching feels like could be tremendously inspiring. The museum could be a living organizing center for this.
