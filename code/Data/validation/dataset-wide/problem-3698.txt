I have a problem to assess when it's ok to stop during a stretching exercise. My pain tolerance is pretty high and some people say you have to stop the moment you start to feel pain/discomfort ( stop or hold the stretch, it depends on what protocol you are following ), some other instead say you have to go a little bit further. So I am about confused on the topic. Is there anyone that can show me some evidences on how to perform a stretch in terms of pain perception? 

It depends on your goals actually. And on what you want to improve. Instead on focusing on zones, why dont you focus better on volume of training? Because you dont even mention about it: its just a 3x meters and thats it. If you feel a certain zone is conservative try to increase volume. But again, it really come down to what feature you're trying to improve. 

What your trainer said you is in part right. Just in part. First of all you have to understand why it works like he said. Muscle activity i mostly based on contraction, and on firing rate of muscle fibers. When you have a low and constant rate of contraction you activate different proteins inside the muscle and tend to change you muscle fenotype thowards an oxidative type. Vice versa, with higher peaks and stronger contractions you will get a glycolitic type of muscle; and this type of muscle is the one you want to get if you are trying to aim at power/strenght sports and/or hypertrophy ( composed mostly of IIa and IIx fibers ). The two actors of this tale are the AMPK and the mTOR What your trainer said to you happens when the AMPK and and some of its downstream transcription factors are activated in a much robus manner than mTOR. Vice versa, when you practise resistance training ( train with weights ) something different occurs. There is a higher appearance in the muscle of the mRNA ( that indicates at which level a protein is transcribed and this present, in this case ) that transcribe mTOR and other of his downstream targets. This means hypertrophy. The solution is that you do cardio actually before training with weights. This will be no detrimental at all. Here is a link to the one of the studies I'm referring to: Exercise-induced AMPK activation does not interfere with muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance training in men. 

Obviously the amount of protein and carbohydrates in the diet are crucial while you're going in a deficit. First of all, training with weights is going to decrease the catabolism in your muscle tissue ( catabolism is a wide concept, and always occur in your body in different contexts ). This is due to the molecular axe Akt-mTORC1 and their downstreams. The anabolic nature of this axe will prevent you from loosing more lean tissue than you would if you didn't actually train while you are in a deficit. This particular pathway is enhanced also by the pulsatile secretion of testosterone due to training, and so has a good protective effect. You have to consider that this process is happening even while you are on a hypercaloric regimen and trying to bulk up. But in this particular scenario you're in its blunted depending on you dieting pattern. I'll explain you how: 

Now we can go on with the actual periodization finally. Even if litterature has tons of good reviews on the subject resistance training for beginners, I want to give you my approach. However, this is a comprehensive review that at the best of my knowledge is the most accurate. Goin on from this you want to focus on mostly one thing: FREQUENCY over volume. First of all because is a known FACT that novices needs not big training loads to induce a supercompensation phenomenon and I could reference you with plenty of books, but I limit myself to two: 

There's this long going notion that you cannot re-shape a muscle through trainig: what do you think about it? 

You have to build economy in the tecnique of run. This means you want to increase your speed as much as you can but without going above the 4 mmol threshold of lactic acid in the blood. For the breaks If you want to use them in training, you can use repetition of 1/3 or 1/4 of the distance you want to run at slightly higher intensity ( for exemple 4x10km at >10 beats x min of your normal %HR ) And you can train even for the distance itself, trying to improve the running skill aswell as the metabolic machine to endure such a race. It all about the total weekly workload. On top of that you require instruments to measure your Hear Rate and use it as a parameter to work in the right "zone". Now, if you wanna use it during a race just use it whenever your pace is starting to decrease or your movement is not synchronized ( sign that fatigue is starting to build up ). It will prevent you from overheating as long as you are hydrated, and yes it will remove waste from the muscle ( that is a process always ongoing ) as quickly as possible. Im telling you as soon as you feel tired because you dont want to indulge in glycolitic metabolism too much expecially if you dont have a great oxidative system or your muscle are still not at that level of fenotypization. 

First of all, I've found some reference that state in a very well designed study that the improvement in mood occur regardless of the time of the day[1]. ( Take in consideration that in this particular study the exercise protocol was only lasting 20 minutes ). You have to consider that some times the improvement in the mood is even not related to measurable parameters of exercise ( it doesn't depend on the nature of the exercise itself ). Experimental procedures to assess exercise impact on the mood should be very precise because there are a lot of studies out there that are not so precise[2]. In conclusion, to answer your question: yes is it possible that your mood improves in such short time. But there will not be ONLY strictly scientific clues to that; mood is not a scientific concept in close sense, and there will always be other variables that influence it other than hormones and neurotransmitters. The second reference however, if you can get it in full paper, is a comprehensive meta-analysis on all mood studies. You will not see in the tables the duration of the exercise protocol, aswell as the type and the intensity ( actually more influent variables ). 

If found in litterature loads of papers challenging the concept of AT ( Anaerobic Threshold ). Most of them explain how this is only a construct and how and why previous expert were lead into believing that there is a POINT where metabolism shifts. Who can explain me better this topic and possibly clarify if in the scientific realm has finally someone drawn a endpoint to this? 

Let's make this clear and net. First of all you can also avoid eating just after a workout if you're not hungry ( it's relly common ); just wait an hour or two maybe and then eat, unless you have a second workout later on the same day. Your body is actually using the energy from pervious meals to replenish what you have used ( mostly in terms of glycogen ) during your workout. This is called an excessive post-exercise oxygen consumption. The slow component of this phenomenon happens in actually about 1h after you train ( mostly at high intesities ). Your body is actually consuming more oxygen than normal resting condition and relying mostly on the oxidative type of energy. This untill your energy stores are replenished. And this is crucial for one reason: you have to replenish your energy levels first and then starting the adaptation cycle in terms of protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is an extremely expansive process that tends to not occur when you have low energy levels, due to some molecular signals. Now that I set this straight, we shall proceed with nutritional advices. First of all I want to quote the most comprehensive review of litterature on the subject ( at the best of my knowledge ) in regards to the topic. Determinants of post-exercise glycogen synthesis during short-term recovery. This is an article published on Sport Medicine, so I don't know if you have full access ( if you don't, you can request the article here ); I will try to quote the highligts of the article referring to your questions: 

To do this you have to run in sets at that speed increasing the volume of training. Instead of doing straight 3Km, try and do 3x 1.x Km ( where the x stand for a certain amounts of meters that you will decide ). That x will be your incremental each time you feel your comfortable at that pace and that time. You have to take in account that going uphill or downhill will be a variable that you must take in consideration ( so if you can avoid, do it ). On top fo that, try to be on point nutritionwise ( cannot give you any advice because largely depends on you nutritonal habits ). Once you have done that you will find that your maximal anaerobic lactic speed will go up and eventually you will end up being capable of running more. In between sets try active rest ( reduce your pace trying to stay around 50% HRmax ). 

So basically this is it. Periodization advices could be given more in depth if your objective was more specific and in relation to a known sport. How to asses ANT There are plenty of tests to asses the ANT. The main problem here is actually the sport in which you perform. For cycling you want to use a cyclo-ergometer, but for running there are plenty of field tests. Take in consideration that you want to asses the correlation with speed/power and the time it takes to reach exhaustion. Here some good indication on some tests. 

Let's make this clear Periodization is a way to conceptualize training developed by russian coaches that helped to manipulate the time with which an athlete reacted to training. Even for a beginner periodization is actually more useful than going blind. The issue between advanced athletes and beginners is about two majour points: 1- Minimum load necessary: the minimum load that an athlete requires to produce a supercompensation and thus results. 2- Heterogeneity of skills targeted: dividing the workload on multiple target will diminish the amount of workload each one is going to get. If for beginners is good to target multiple skills at the same time ( because each one of them will get the right amount of load ), its not the same for an advanced athlete. And when I say "skill" I'm referring either to a conditional capacity like anaerobic power or a coordinative skill like trowing a hammer. At this purpose in the 80s, Vladimir Issurin came up with the Block Periodization: a multipeak performance concept of periodization that helped to reduce the hours/year ratio of training and eventually improve performance. Right now is a concept widely adopted from most of the top level coaches. Anyway what you're asking is simpler: yes, you will actually benefit of periodizing your training regimen EVEN if you're a novice. The timing is based mostly on how well you know the athlete and his/her body ( or yours, in the case you wanna apply this to yourself ) and the reaction it has. The reduction of volume in strenght training is actually crucial, because at the same time intensity goes up if its a realization microcycle and in that time you notice most of your progress.
