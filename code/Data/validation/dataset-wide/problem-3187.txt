Conversely, in the Eastern societies (at least, the named examples with royal harems), all sons were acknowledged and given a place in the succesion line. 

This is stylistically typical of Qajar period, Persian walrus ivory jambiya hilts. As user @Spencer noted, human figures are rarely depicted in Islamic art other than in paintings. However Qajar artworks were the exception that proved the rule, and exhibited significant European influence. Likewise, such hilts were commonly decorated with Gothic-esque reliefs, and inscribed in either Persian or less comonly Arabic, in the nastaʿlīq or taʿlīq scripts. The inscriptions are often some relevant, cool sounding phrase. The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds one item where the nastaʿlīq inscription reads, "the handle of your dagger is world-seizing." Harvard Art Museums has one example commissioned by Aga Khan, with a ta'liq inscription that described its relief as the: "likeness of the incomparable Muhammad Shah, a heaven of grandeur, a vessel of beauty". 

This is the crest, a rather obscure design used by the Aki Clan of (surprise, surprise) Aki Dstrict in the Tosa Province of Shikoku. The Aki Clan is said to be descended from Soga no Umako, a powerful minister in Ancient Japan whose descendants were later exiled from the capital after a power dispute in the royal court. 

Thirdly, and going hand in hand with the second point, because many countries felt they had something to gain. Most of them sought civilian/economic benefits from nuclear technology. During the negotiations for the NPT, these countries - as a condition of their acceptance - extracted concessions in this regard. The security concerns of the non-nuclear states also resulted in promises by nuclear states that they would not use them on non-nuclear states. Although such a provision failed to be formally incorporated into the treaty, the Great Powers did make formal promises to that effect. Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union all made some variation of an assurance to not attack non-nuclear states. Although there are loopholes, this helped confirm the growing consensus that nuclear weapons are not regular bombs and shouldn't be used lightly. 

The Austrians were a bit ahead of the curve here, having abandoned the cuirass in 1859. Previously however Austria alone of the major powers maintained cuirassiers through both the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Most other cavalries had entered the 1700s with cuirassiers, but abandoned them over the course of the century. Napoleon's success in deploying cuirassiers as shock troops heralded a renaissance (or rather, a last hurrah) for the armoured heavy cavalry. The cuirass thus curiously re-emerged in several armies after Napoleon's defeat. Prussia, having abandoned the armour in 1790, re-equipped her cuirassiers with captured French cuirasses in 1814, as did the Spanish in 1810. The Russians likewise began equipping their heavy cavalry with personal armour in 1812. 

One example of this is the House of Brown, the leading Anglo-American trading bank in the 19th century. By 1832 it controlled 1/6 of all Anglo-American trade. In Britain Brown, Shipley & Co. was established in 1810 and in America the Browns, Bros. & Co. in 1818. The former handled, for instance, cotton imports from the American South to Britain. As you'd expect, at times of instability hard currency became preferred. For example, when the threat of war was looming, credit was swapped out for hard currency and shipped home. 

Pilgrims from all over Greece came to Delphi to seek answers from the priestess, the most prestigious of her kind in the classical world. Many of them would disembark at Cirrha, the closest port to Delphi. The city took advantage of this to impose a toll on pilgrims, a sacrilegious act that ultimately provoked a war with the Amphictyonic League. 

This is a subject of some dispute, but perhaps the most common view is that Hannibal probably crossed the Pyrenees via the mountain passes of modern Le Perthus. 

Labour groups attracted vigilantes and popular condemnation for a different reason. Since much industrial and mining concerns were now considered critical components of the war effort, industrial action became represented as treasonous pro-German plots. Such accusations attracted the hateful attention of the populace easily. An illustrative example is the infamous deportation of striking miners in Bisbee, Arizona. Convinced that the strikers were foreigners engaging in a seditious German plot, a massive posse and summarily arrested over a thousand mine workers at gun point. They were then forcibly deported to New Mexico by rail, where they were dumped without food or water. As it turns out a majority were in fact American citizens, with most of the rest being British, Russian or Serbian. Many had purchased Liberty Bonds or were registered for the draft. Such actions, both from the civil population and later with the assistance of government forces, severely demoralised workers, who were the natural support base of socialism. Socialists would subsequently discover that they were more successful in cities that had not yet experienced the bitter failures of industrial action 

Regardless of hypothetical scenarios, ultimately the United States never attempted a ground invasion of North Vietnam. Thus, bluff or genuine promise, China was never confronted with the choice of whether to follow through with their threat of intervening in Vietnam. 

Unfortunately we can't know for certain how the nomination operated. Nonetheless, the prevailing understanding of scholars is that a dispute between the censors would be satisfactorily resolved through allotment. 

However, Professor Knecht rejected this explanation by arguing that the French nobility did not experience a general economic collapse. I include it only for reference. 

In the Netherlands, by the middle of the period, the mean ages at first marriages for women were estimated to be about 20-21 at mid 16th century Leiden, and 23.5-25 at late 16th century Amsterdam. Both groups married husbands who were on average 1-2 years older. These numbers further increased after the 17th century. Overall, the evidence is that European marriage patterns resembles that of the 20th century. 

The division of Egyptian history into Old and New Kingdoms was pioneered by Carl Richard Lepsius. In his 1858 Königsbuch der alten Ägypter, Lepsius grouped Manetho's Dynasties under the categories Alten Reich and Neues Reich, assigning Dynasties XVII to XXXI in the latter. This periodisation seem to have been inspired by Baron von Bunsen's work in the 1830s or 40s. I'm not sure why the Oxford Companion to Archaeology chose to credit Meyer over Lepsius here. 

The key point here is that Chamberlain's rearmament was opposed by the Labour Party. So even if people were to argue Chamberlain was too much of a pacifist to be a war leader, such an attack would have needed to come from within his own party, not the political opposition. As we shall see, he retained the support of the Conservative Party right to the very end. That's not to say some individuals may have suspected Chamberlain of cowardice or inaction, especially as the phony war drew on, but it would have been an incredible claim shortly after the Chamberlain ministry declared war in 1939. In any case, up to his resignation but there was no general feeling that Chamberlain couldn't be trusted to fight. Of course, whether he could fight well is another question entirely. Why didn't Chamberlain resign much earlier, since his championing of appeasement had clearly failed? The premise here seems to be that people would have wanted to punish Chamberlain, so to speak, with removal from office for pursuing Appeasement. The thing is, that is an anachronistic view of the road to war, one certainly not shared by Chamberlain or his contemporaries. The reason is simple: most of them advocated or applauded appeasement just a year ago. Chamberlain didn't invent or "champion" Appeasement, he simply believed he had no other realistic option. Historians now realise that British leaders including Chamberlain were acutely aware of just how weak the British military was, how adverse the strategic situation was, and how constrained they were by the poor economic and financial resources available. The British public at home was still in no mood for war - Chamberlain was universally cheered in the press when he returned from Munich. Overseas, the Dominions refused to support a "war of aggression" against Germany, and the United States remained stuck in its isolationist ways. 

Farming and Trading In 1873 the government began offering the shizoku a lump sum payment and government bonds, in exchange for surrendering their perpetual stipends. The measure was intended to simulate economic growth by providing investment capital, as well as to reduce the heavy burden of stipends on government expenditures. About 135,800 members of the shizoku accepted the offer. Many of them used this money to purchase land (the Ehime Prefecture recorded 70% declared intent to buy land for farming in their applications) and became farmers. The government provided assistance in buying forest or abandoned lands cheaply. Some however chose to going into commerce (from the same Prefecture, 18%) but due to their inexperience tended to be less successful. Things were particularly difficult for those caught by the Matsukata Deflation. Hokkaido Settler During the Meiji era, Japan began actively colonising Hokkaido, a project in which many samurai participated. The earlier waves came from Northeastern Japan, which was the primary centre of opposition to the Meiji Restoration. After a brief war from which government forces emerged victorious, the Tokugawa loyalist domains were heavily penalised. The rebel domains had their territory confiscated by the new government, and could no longer support their samurai retainers. Many returned to farming, but some decided to seek better fortunes by settling Hokkaido. For example, Date Kunishige of the Sendai Han saw his territory reduced from 23,853 koku pre-war to a mere 58 koku. That was far too small to support his retinue, whose members plus their family numbered 7,800. Thus, Kunishige sold his heirlooms and funded nine expeditions to Hokkaido, settling 2,600 of his samurai at what would later become the City of Date. Similar efforts from the rest of the Sendai Han sent about 4700 shizoku in total. Other domains such as the Tokushima Han and the Aizu Han also sent out smaller bands of samurai colonists. Military Colonists The second type of shizoku settlement in Hokkaido emerged after the Meiji government converted all stipends to government bonds forcibly in 1876. To alleviate the ensuing hardship, various schemes to provide the shizoku with property, called were devised. In addition to selling them government land cheaply (à la those who voluntarily surrendered their stipends earlier), one project was to colonise Hokkaido using the shizoku as armed settlers. They would serve the dual purpose of both establishing settlements on the frontier, as well as forming the first line of defense against Imperial Russia. A total of 7,337 families, or some 40,000 military settlers, took part in the resulting tondenhei system. The government began recruiting civilians in later years, but participation was limited to the shizoku until 1893. By that stage around 3,000 former samurai families had been settled. Other shizoku families also migrated to Hokkaido as civilians under favourable government arrangements, but that was ended in favour of the tondenhei by the early 1880s Commerce and Industry Setting the samurai to work on reclaiming farmland was a major plank of the government's relief programme. Another major component of the policy, however, was to encourage them to start businesses and participate in industry. To this end the Meiji government made available cheap[3] loans and provided advice on setting up businesses. By 1882, the shizoku had created almost 200 commercial or industrial entities. Some became leaders in profitable export products such as tea or silk. Others became producers of their regional speciality goods. Still others assisted in the national westernisation effort by transplanting foreign technology into Japan, such as the example of Onoda Cement. These companies would employ some 100,000 shizoku, who would have been a valuable source of educated[4] workforce. 

Let us disregard the role of sexual jealousy and focus on the practical impact of such succession laws. Since any of them could produce the future emperor, all sexual partners of the ruler must be guarded from other men. This is to ensure that they could only be impregnated by the ruler himself, so that the correct progeny continue to sit on the throne. Indeed, this is why harems were commonly staffed by eunuchs6: 

(In recent years this has been rendered as "America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves". That is rather more similar to McCarthy's purported "quote", but post-dates his speech by decades.) Of course, we cannot know for certain who (if anyone) McCarthy meant, since he failed to explicitly name this "outstanding historical figure". Nonetheless, it is worth remembering that McCarthy made the reference while delivering a Lincoln Day speech. In fact, he began with:
