If this is part of her job role, then the only thing you can do is say your opinion and give her an impact analysis with the cost and other consequences the requested change will have. Give your feedback verbaly at first and if she does not change her mind, send an e-mail with a detailed analysis. After that you will have to accept her decision, whichever may be. If this is not part of her job role then you have to escalate the issue to higher management. 

Low severity If the consequences of the bug are minor, then you have to convince your boss that the cost of fixing the problem is much greater than the benefits. Then the manager will have to handle the customer. If you cannot convince your manager then say to him, that you will work on the problem for one hour every day, and that you cannot estimate when this problem will be solved. This will give you three benefits : 

Embrace the criticism. If there are any good points talk it over with the person that made the critisim, and incorporate in your solution any valid alternatives offered by this individual. But at the same time the team must not loose the control of the project. Make sure your manager understands why you must behave this way. Quality reviews by expered outsiders can be very helpfull and efficient, if done correctly.

Remember that your resume will probably find its way past a parser at some point. As such, adding a section like this - and making it as complete as possible - is only a help to you! Obviously, if you include a "buzzword" you should be able to back it up in an interview, but including the concept on the resume prevents the parser from denying you that interview in the first place. 

Communicating to get results really boils down to one simple principle - Hone your message done to what the listener is going to hear. This has been expressed in several ways by several great books, but here are few ways of seeing this principle at work: 

The question can be used to illustrate what you value as important - you just need to phrase it in a negative way. It can be answered in such a way as to show that you and the company hold the same values. For example: 

I don't think it matters directly. I.e. I can't imagine any recruiter paying attention to which city you got your experience with technology X in. Your choice has indirect consequences though. In big cities with busy IT life, you obviously have more work opportunities to choose from in the long run, but also fiercer competition. More challenges can help you grow, but can also crush you. Moreover, you have more opportunities to network with like minded people, participate in local user groups etc. which can help improving your skills and career chances if used wisely. However, now in the internet age, you can self study and connect to fellow developers from almost everywhere if you have the determination. And one final point, which may actually be the most important in the long run: career growth and salary are good things, up to a point. But (IMHO) these shouldn't be the sole aim of one's life, rather just means to create and secure the life one desires. So the overall quality of life is important. Making a big career and earning lots of money via spending a large part of your life in a city which is polluted, ugly and hostile may actually make you burn out or even ill in the long run, which, needless to say, breaks your career too. Depending on your preferences, you may very well be better off living in a clean, beautiful and friendly place even if you earn less money and don't get as high promotions as fast. But happiness and satisfaction with your life makes you perform better at work too in the long term. 

You get the idea - try not to us a buzzword, try not to use the same old lines everyone else does. Really, this is an exercise in vocabulary, creativity, and salesmanship. Have the adjectives before hand, and you'll ace it. Finally, if you can ascribe an adjective to something people have actually said about you, that earns you "objectively great." 

Its a classic question of specialization. I have a great deal of Lotus Notes experience - a technology that is greatly loved by a very small community and pretty well dismissed by everyone else. If I chose to headlight those skills, I could get jobs very, very easily in a very, very small pond. As the number of people with that expertise dwindles, it becomes more and more lucrative for the few people still using it - but it limits you at the same time. The question you have to ask yourself is whether or not you want to play that game or play the game of being the best on a wide range of new technologies. In other words, are you going to go broad or go deep. Going Broad has the advantage of allowing you to advance in terms of leadership (if not necessarily salary) and in my case, helps me to sleep at night, knowing that when the last Lotus Notes shop moves to something else, I don't have a massive retraining. (And no, I haven't used my Lotus Notes background for about 3 years now). On the other hand, if you like to stay put and go deep on one thing, you could do a lot worse than VB6. Sure, its nearing EOL, but as recently as 2009, 87% of companies were still using it. There will be VB6 apps around for a long time, in the same way COBOL is still out there. Will you have the pick of jobs anywhere? No. But will you have security? Sure. 

Peter got mad mostly because he thought his brother worked behind his back, not because of the interviews. And Paul regarded your action as a kind of complaint or snithcing. All this would have been avoided if Paul talked to Peter first. Patience and time is probably the best remedy. At some point Paul will ask you something, and gradually the whole thing will be forgotten. 

You did nothing wrong but in my opinion it would have been better to ask Paul to get permision from your boss. For example 

First of all let him talk a little about his favor subject, as long it is not offensive to you. He would appreciate it and this will strengthen the friendship. Then, after a few minutes change into a subject that is mutually interesting by saying something like "Meanwhile, what to you thing about ZZ ..." 

There is definitely a conflict of interest between the CFO and your direct manager. One option is to try to resolve it. Arrange a meeting between you, the CFO and your direct manager and try to set some acceptable unambiguous rules regarding task assignment from both of them. 

Again, in each of these things, the point of effective communication is this simple - Focus on the recipient, not yourself. The best communication has a hint of yourself but is made concrete in a way that says "You are the most important recipient of this." 

What you value in yourself How well you can describe a situation using a few words How quickly you think on your feet. 

*Clarification, based on a good comment. If, after you have gotten through the interview, and been given a job, you may be asked to complete an application that says "Please list all jobs." If you are feeling particularly supercilious, you should probably list it at that time - on the off chance somebody decides to do a full life audit. At worst, the hiring manager may ask, "What's this?" You say: "It's a job I held for two weeks. It really wasn't worth mentioning, because ..." and you then explain. The resume is about the first impression here - the application comes when it is pretty much a done deal. 

The only "bad" answer here is to use generic adjectives that don't set you apart or boring, vapid ones that say "He's a muggle." (Obviously, you don't want to get too wild and wooly - "hard-drinking, life of the party, etc..." But an interesting adjective has a lot to commend itself.) Oh, and you don't need 5 - you just need one really, really good one. (And 4 backups, in case you don't wow them on the first.) Everybody is "smart," "hard-working," and "creative." If you choose interesting adjectives and can back them up this is an opportunity to set you apart. 

And from your part, it would be better to give them examples and stories showing how your self-study improved your skills and experience in the past, and why you are eager to continue that. This may give a much more realistic picture of your skills and motivation to your prospective employer than telling you spend on average 1 minute or 3 hours per day studying. As well as this way you avoid the dilemma over getting committed into something you may not want to. 

I think that from your points it already shows fairly well, that it is most likely not going to do you a service to continue this in the long run. 

I think you need to understand the different cultural background of people from Eastern countries (in the broad sense). In these cultures openly admitting a fault is seen as a weakness and personal loss, hence people try to avoid this at all costs and fight back at any perceived attempt to criticize them or their actions or decisions. Which of course does make it very challenging for people from other cultures to work with them and solve problems together, but this is just a given which IMO you need to understand. So if you want to continue working with them and succeed with the project, I think you'd better avoid any direct criticism, and try to frame it instead as an improvement idea, or try to give them subtle hints only and allow them to "invent" the great idea by themselves. In this way their ego will not be threatened and they can be made to accept new ideas. The obvious backside is that they will most likely take the credit for any success and any novel idea. If you can live with that, go ahead; if not, try to get out of this as soon as possible. 

Wear the tie. If the environment is such that it is inappropriate, you can always take it off. Indeed, the act of taking it off can even signal that you feel relaxed, and non-verbally cues others to this fact. If you take the tie, you can remove it. If you don't take the tie, it looks silly to be putting it on if you feel you need it. On sales calls, even if I suspect the environment is casual, I always aim for one notch above. You never know when you will need it, and you can always kick it back. It is harder to kick it up... 

Unfortunately, you can't just say "Well, if you think it can be done in 2 hours, I'd love to see you try!" The truth is that in order to get projects approved, one often needs to underestimate the project. Once approved, the developers want a cushion. This expands the estimate. The conflict between these two imperatives is inextricably part of the estimate negotiation between you and your manager. One of the most successful tactics I've found is to expand the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). In project management, this is a list of the tasks that must be performed, presented in an outline form. When initially recievieng the estimate, you probably have 3 levels of WBS. PMP Methodology says you can have up to 6. By enumerating all of the tasks, you can build in a better margin, spread out over more tasks. Not only is it easier to estimate a smaller unit of work, but by defining more of what must occur, you can justify it more easily too. Within each of these tasks, however, its also easier to "hide the camel." Is it really going to take you 1 hour to update DNS for these new websites? No. It'll probably take about 5 minutes. The rest of the hour is all research. The downside, of course, is that it is very hard to say agile when expanding the tree. As such, just putting it all out there, even if informally, is your best defense. 

Mentioning to HR that you have another offer should not be a problem in itself - every job seeker is looking for multiple options, just as well as every company is interviewing multiple candidates before hiring. And the better you are, the more options you have. So it might even increase your desirability, but certainly won't decrease it. I think it is also OK to ask for a timeframe, you just need to be careful to avoid making the impression that you are pressurizing them for a decision. That would basically be the same trick as what HR at company A is playing with you when they say you need to decide about their offer by Wednesday. And since HR people all know this trick, most of them probably don't like it applied on them ;-) From what you describe, this may be interpreted by B in a bad way. To make a decision, you need to rank your priorities. Is it more important for you to get a job fast, even if it is less than ideal, or are you looking for the best job you can get, even if it takes longer time to land in it? Assuming the latter, my suggestion is
