When you can't be accurate, you need a decent spread. Therefore I suggest you fire a planet at them. Fill it with planet busters and explode it like a giant cluster grenade upon entering the system. This has the advantage of costing a planet to take out a planet, making it a relatively limited resource as all good superweapons should be. 

They are likely going to be a social recluse, as their ability to empathize with others will lead many to open up to them, which could rapidly become overwhelming. They might take advantage of this to become a psychologist, although they may not like the idea of listening to people's problems on a daily basis - hence the likelihood of becoming reclusive. They will often cause frustration in others, as their empathy to all will often likely prompt them to play DevIls advocate, which less empathetic types will not appreciate when all they're trying to do is get their own, self centred point across without wanting to hear the other person's side of things. This depends whether they're empathetic to the person in front of them, or people as a whole. They will be capable of incredibly convincing arguments, as they will be aware of the motivations lurking behind people's denial of their statements, and with practice will be able to isolate and confront these. They will be introspective, likely philosophical, as their empathy will show them patterns in people which they will naturally look for in themselves, and draw potentially insightful conclusions from. They might see society as an aggressor, forcing people's thoughts down certain predefined paths. They may believe most people are sheep - but not blame them for this, as many would - and so attempt to throw a spanner in the works when social norms are hurting someone without their knowledge. They will probably be pretty funny, as they'll be able to find situations that are comical from the perspective of the person they're talking to, not just from their own subjecive perspective. They will be masters of hypothetical arguments, making them capable of stunning insights not related to empathy. Empathy is essentially hypothetical at its core, and so generating multiple possible scenarios with various outcomes will become the norm to them. They will probably make an excellent scientist, if they so desire. Finally, they will probably be full of self doubt, as they will see the many irrational thought patterns exhibited by others, and constantly worry that they themselves fall into these patterns (this may force them down a hyper-rational route, vetting everything they believe). They may have anxiety issues, due to the overwhelming nature of empathizing with all, and it's plausible that they'd require some sort of character arc to deal with this. 

It could have something to do with the fact that it's an area that doesn't corrupt the light that hits it, or something like that... perhaps the portal's created by tweaking the method by which the mirror manipulates the light, to do something beyond my understanding, which causes a portal to form. For this to work, I imagine the light would have to be pure both before and after reflection, and a mirror is the obvious choice for this. You could have it being possible to create portals on less reflective surfaces, like ponds etc, but have them be more unstable, or only able to be used for viewing, not transporting, etc. 

Paid Labourers, if they can build the pyramids they can transport goods across a desert. Edit: Paid labourers are capable of moving tons of goods across long distances, and can be made to carry water where necessary. Nothing else needs to be said really, it's the obvious answer considering the limitations stated in the question. Failing that, use slaves. 

Women are generally predisposed toward seeking someone higher up the power structure than they are. An alien is so far above a human, they'd be appealing almost by default, to many people. If they couldn't have a kid that might cause problems, but I imagine aliens could do some trick where they make a clone of the lady, and swap out half the DNA for theirs, I guess. Gonna suck if they then find out that their new space-husband is an intergalactic street sweeper, eventually the situation may become normalized and they may regret rushing into things with the first alien they met, that could make for a fairly good arc. 

The red suits are optional, worn by crew members who find a post-scarcity life too boring and risk-free for their liking. As a group they see themselves as the elite, willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, when nobody else is willing to take up the mantle and don the red. Such a worldview is intolerable to the C.A.S.T principles of equality, however as those afflicted with such moral superiority complexes are already taking measures to lower their lifespans, it's seen as a problem that is solving itself. 

A dog has intelligence, so using human consciousness as a marker of AI is flawed - this is why the Turing test is based on ego, not a pure definition of intelligence. I made a YouTube video on this very subject, I'll try to summarize. Remember - An intelligence can remember things it has experienced Reason - An intelligence can draw conclusions based on past experiences Reflect - An intelligence can look back on its actions and change its behaviour based on previous outcomes I think these three R's represent pure intelligence, and that what most people are trying to emulate is AC - Artificial Consciousness. Realistically, they're aiming for AHC - Artificial Human Consciousness, which is a flawed target due to the many external biological influences that impact how the brain works, but it is what it is. 

Based on the other answers, it sounds like human nerves are the limiter here. If you're willing, your protagonist could have undergone some procedure (think riddick eyeballs), but relating to their nervous system instead, letting them react faster than other people are able. Perhaps then they'd be able to dodge bullets, and also potentially some other cool stuff that I can't think of right now. 

Have regular elections, the same as usual. I believe the theocracy will always win a majority, if they're the only ones who can stop the demonic hordes, and mention that they'll pull their support if they lose - nice and neat, although somewhat shady on the part of the theocrats. No shadier than regular politics though, really, if you think about it. 

Most people do not have the geographical knowledge to distinguish between good and bad representations, and so I would say it looks fine - better than fine actually, it looks natural enough to be entirely plausible to the layman. 

I'm one of the test subjects for a new device, capable of sending an individual back to any point in history. I've been told that - due to certain problems with the process - I'll arrive naked, and so have no means of returning to the present, meaning if I want to provide feedback and/or data, I'll have to leave a message that will survive long enough to be picked up by the research teams of today. Some of the previous test subjects have already accomplished this, but they've all been sent into relatively stable time periods, where humanity was already well established, so they could get away with time capsules, hidden codes in the bible, etc. Due to my skillset as an extreme survivalist, I'm being sent back to well before humanity had climbed out of the trees - they're aiming for the Mesozoic era. This means dinosaurs (including T-Rex), and likely a whole host of other things unseen by anyone. My mission is to a) survive, and b) leave a message that is likely to be found by my team in the present, documenting when I arrived (if I can figure this out they can possibly bring me back) along with anything else that may be of interest. This message will hopefully contain the first human account of dinosaur behaviour, but we'll see what happens. Assuming I can stay alive, which method of storing a message would be the most likely to survive until the present, considering the earth will be hit by a meteor sometime after I arrive (not too soon after, I hope). If the message can be concealed in such a way that only my research team would be able to decipher it, that would be ideal, but is a secondary concern - for me, at least. Note: This is not a duplicate of Million Year Time Capsule as the length of time is 65x as long, and involves meteor impacts 

My answer would be: They believe they understand it. Come up with an explanation that is not valid science, but that the humans believe is valid science. No further investigation needed, and anyone claiming it is supernatural is ridiculed. 

Politics should go against the very idea of Bakuninism. Ceding anything to a political power, regardless of its formation or virtues, would be conforming to a hierarchy. No political structure will have any power, without the ability to enforce some sort of ruling upon its members, otherwise it is entirely redundant - yet that very act of enforcing places it in direct opposition to Bakunin's claim that none should have any authority over an individual. Cryptocurrency is not going to change that, and the abolishing of corporations and middle entities will only see them replaced by new corporations and middle entities. After all, if you cannot impose your will upon another, who is going to stop them from - voluntarily - forming? There is huge advantage in pooling resources, and as long as a resource such as currency exists, those who pool the most will have power over those who do not. You could abolish currency, but that would be imposing authority on others, as if they wanted to create their own currency - voluntarily - it would be beyond anyone's right to stop them. What do you do? Ban people from pooling resources? That goes against the principles of Bakunin. Allow them to pool resources and exert pressure on those who choose not to do so? That goes against the principles of Bakunin. His arguments make no sense, and appear designed to appeal to those with nothing - an easy argument, as they have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
