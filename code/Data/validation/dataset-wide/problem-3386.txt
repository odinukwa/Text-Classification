By 'complex system' I mean a system of interrogative pronouns which includes more than just 'animate/inanimate' classes of prounouns, like these of 'who' and 'what' in English (e.g. a special interrogatiuve pronoun for each one of Bantu-like classes - if there is such a thing; or gender-specific interrogative pronouns (like 'which one?' having a feminine/masculine/neuter genders in Russian, or French quel(le)? with a close meaning). Another sub-question is: are person-specific interrogative pronouns possible at all? Like who+you? / what+we? / when-(s)he, etc. This could be a fairly economical way of a language strategy, but I am not quite sure if that is possible at all in any language. At least, none of the languages I am familiar with has such a feature. 

Tibetan alphabet is an abugida divided by groups of four syllables in tonally descending order. The syllables can combine into ligatures with other syllables by either writing a (part of a) syllable sign above or below each other, making altogether about 15,000 possible combinations. Tibetan has ancient written tradition and an abugida ligature written as e.g. 'rgyud' may be roughly read as 'juhd', a syllable ligature of 'bzhi' as 'jih', etc. Since Tibetan spoken in my environment differs greatly from its dialects spoken by native Tibetans elsewhere, I would very appreciate any answer(s) to the following question(s): 

In my opinion, a suitability of a language for creative writing is a matter of creative witer' s language proficiency. Any language fits just fine, the trick is to let its poetics flow. Speaking on Slavic languages, I thing that irregular word order together with, say, irregular word stress (like in Russian) is more like a disaster for a poetic rhythm than an advantage. 

Suppose a person speaks several languages, occasionally making mistakes in grammar(s), using untypical patterns, clichés and/or calques. Can such a level of language competence be defined as bilingualism/multilingualism? Do bilingual speakers ever make language slips? Do multilingual persons make language mistakes more often than bilingual or monolingual speakers? 

Translationg the terms makes a semantic rendering important. The English resourse translates क्रोध [krodha] as 'anger' wrath, passion, etc.' with the same definition for कोप​ [kopa] plus defining it as 'morbid irritation or disorder of the humors of the body'. The compound noun कोपकारण [kopakāraṇa] is rendered there as 'cause of anger', by which I deduce that in English translation these two words are mainly synonymous and covered by a same semantic field. Tibetan language renders both क्रोध [krodha] and कोप​ [kopa] as ཁྲོ་བ་ [khro ba] and ཁྲོས་པ་ [khros pa] respectively. The German resourse covers both terms with the word 'wrath' with क्रोध [krodha] being in some context synonymous to 'passion'. Ah, and कोप​ [kopa], too. So my question is, are there any other possible distinction between the meaning of these two words except of possible [structured] क्रोध [krodha] VS [non-structured] कोप​ [kopa]? Are these two words cognates? 

If you choose to be more Tolkien-like and less punctual about centuries, you could mention Forest Finns as well. As we can see from Ukrainian story, neighbors and kins are more likely to have an issue with human lives than more distant nations. Karelian and Votic have a lot of consonant clusters (unlike Finnish). Same with Veps. So, my offer is either to use one of these survivors among dialects, or (if the consonant clusters are OK for you) to choose for one of the Saami languages. It's Fenno-Ugric (although not as much Fenno-Ugric as to be mistaken for Soomi by anything save its name), and the Saami tribes were driven northwards by Finnish and Germanic tribes since Medieval period. Another interesting option is Komi language. Despite of being heavily russified by now, it has an interesting history, a fantastic grammar and even its own writing system that predated the Cyrillic alphabet. 

From what I see at this wiki page, these two versions of Armenian show differences in phonology and sometimes in grammar which are greater than, say, a difference between Russian and Polish (and quite close to that between Finnish and Estonian). So, are books written in each one of these two dialects equally intelligible for a speaker of each version of Armenian? Or is there one-direction understanding (as it is the case with Estonian speakers, who can intuitively understand most of spoken and written Finnish, but whose speech is hard to be deciphered by an unprepaired Finnish speaker)? 

Finally, the Passive Form would be svaras (it is answered = ´svara+ s ') and svarades (it was answered/answering = 'svara+*de*+s'). But there is more of agglunativity in Swedish nouns, though:-) Consider e.g. the word eld (fire). The plural form is eld+ar (yes, unlike -or, the -er and -ar endings are applicable for nouns and verbs, although the adjectives have a different plural - or, actually, emphasised - form). The postpositional definite article is -na; hence, 'the fires' will be eld+ar+na => eldarna UPD: the -na here conveys the meaning of both plurality and definitiveness, and can be divided into -n- (postpositive plural definite marker) + a (emphasised form of a noun applicable in plural only). So, this form of word can be further structured as eld+ar+n+a => eldarna Morover, there is a common Germanic survival of the Genitive case, which is - suprisingly! - s. Hence, 'of [the] fires' (like in 'light of [the] fires') will be [[eld+ar+n+a+s] ljus] => eldarnas ljus 

That depends mainly on whether a learner is an introvetive or an extravertive person. For extravertive persons, speaking and live communication is more natural and it takes less efforts, but the best way to memorize words, rules, etc. is to read and to practice language studies alone. For introvertive persons, the opposite strategy is more efficient. That is, introverts spend less energy while reading or doing study-alone language practices, but the most efficient way to memorize anything is to do some group training/real-life communication activities. 

Intervocalic lenition (which, according to Jaskuła, was one of the most probable characteristic of Celtic languages). Word order (which is specific for Continental Celtic and differs from e.g. Italic languages). The state of prepositions (if there were any). Case endings (if there were any). Correspondenses between vocal systems of (Proto) Celtic and Lusitanian, which can be given by e.g. theonyms. 

A sample of any text written constraitively and/or according to grammars of avoidance speech styles (including honorific speech styles for languages with honorific lexemes but without neutrally polite speech styles) would contradict the Zipf's law. This can be best shown by the phonetical and lipogrammatical example of A Void by Perec. This novel has been written without E, the most frequently used French letter, and hence has none of the frequently used words in French vocabulary (e.g. it contains no de and des, which could have the highest freequencies in French texts elsewhere). In short, the conversation would present a large diversity in lexical occurrence due to the very existance of ideolects. 

Everyday communicative patterns. How to ask for things you want to buy? What are everyday words for groceries, housewares or fastfood (provided they are not English)? What are clichés used by speakers of a corresponding sociolect? Sociolects. Not a problemme for languages like Swedish or Dutch, with their minimal socioliguistic distinctions, but starting from French, Spanish, Russian or Arabic a learner meets certain difficulties while choosing from you/You, gender markers, etc. Not mentioning languages with honorifics or more exotic sociolinguistic markers. Immersion is compulsory, books are not. I am not trying to promote a compulsory education, but rather an idea that one can never turn off an inner speech in a studied language while picking up an immersion strategy. Aggressive (or otherwise unexpected) speech patterns. Yes, life is life, and human beings sometimes face aggressive rhetorics, from sarcasm and bullying to swear words, where the other side of communicative channel is not friendly or neutral. This can be extended to any unusual/unexpected speech situations and strategies as well. Personal experience building a linguistic sub-personality installed into learner's cognitive framework. Of course, this can also be achieved from the books as well, but in such a case a learner has to continue with one's inner monologue in a language learned inside one's mental reality without adequate response from the outside world. 

To clarify, pre-positional articles are the articles positioned before a noun they refer to, like English the or a(n). Post-positional articles are those positioned after a noun they refer to, like Swedish -en/-ett, or -na in en skog => skogen (forest => the forest), ett barn =>barnet (a child => the child), Romanian -l/-le in codru => codrul (forest => the forest), or Bulgarian -ът /-та / -то / -те, e.g. гора = гората (forest => the forest), etc. If we look at the languages which have pre-positional articles (not to be confused with languages with articles merged into prepositions, like French du, or Italian della) but which have no post-positional articles, then we notice that these languages also have zero articles. In English, the zero articles are used with mass noun singular. In French, the zero article (or article zéro) serves to denote 'neither massive nor countable' non-partitive noun (which, to my understanding, is somewhat similar to that of Sumerian types of plural). In Spanish, the zero article (or artículo cero) stands for non-possessivness (?) and group partitive. Dutch also has zero articles, although it is difficult to find any reliable work on this topic. What is the situation with prepositional zero articles in other languages?
