This would not be a giant version of eLISA, but a small (and complicated) one. The distance between the LISA satellites will be 1 million kilometers, while the moon is on average 380.000km from Earth. So that arm would be less than half as long. Geosynchronous orbit is at 36.000km, not even 10% of the distance to the moon. The difference in length between your proposed detector arms is much shorter than the coherence length of any laser, so your interferometer would not work. Further problems: 

Lastly, it is not clear to me how you want to replace precision measurement by calculation. What is PLL? How do you get meaningful interference patterns with lasers of different wavelengths? Also note that the "exact distance", if you want to count waves, must be better than half the wavelength of your laser, so a few hundred nanometers. At the distance of the moon, that is better than $1 : 10^{15}$ (hope that calculation is correct). 

Warning: I never worked with spectra, and I don't have a complete answer. Anyway, here's how I understand it: A spectrograph has a resolution $R = \Delta \lambda / \lambda$ that tells us how well it can distinguish light of different wavelengths. VIMOS from the paper has a resolution from 200 to 2500. With the same flux from the source and for a low-resolution spectrograph, you get more photons per wavelength bin than for a high-resolution one. This means you'll also get better SNR. So, giving SNR / wavelength makes inherent sense. Here's where I'm very unsure: giving a SNR / $(0.1$nm$)$ should be equivalent to a magnitude limit, if the spectral energy distribution is the same. Or it could be a minimum quality criterion on the spectrum - stop taking data as soon as the SNR is reached. 

I haven't seen the movie Interstellar yet, but I read in Wired that the famous GR physicist Kip Thorne provided the set of physical equations from GR to the movie's graphical arts team. And that a lot of cpu time was expended solving them. This produced a realistic view of the complicated rapidly varying gravitional lensing of the field of background stars that is seen as one approaches a rotating black hole (according to GR theory). I suppose this would include the stars at the other end of the wormhole as well. The calculations also included the accretion disk surrounding the BH and two scientific papers are expected to result from these calculations. 

What we see at the outer reaches of the observable universe is a surface of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is at the time when the universe, still quite homogeneous (perturbations were a few parts in $10^5$), cooled enough for the electrons to combine with the protons and make hydrogen atoms. Each day, we can see a light-day farther and so we slowly see a different (larger) surface of the CMB (but there were no galaxies at this epoch). Therefore, as we observe the CMB over many years, we will always see the same time epoch, but at different spherical shells. Will we see new galaxies? Yes. Galaxies are forming continuously in view at high redshifts (2-20?). In a few million years, the small perturbations that we see today in the CMB will develop into young galaxies within our view. One cannot provide numbers for how many we might be seeing because small galaxies merge into bigger ones and those merge again. At high redshifts there is a lot of merging going, so the rate is particularly ill defined there. How is this changed by the acceleration from the cosmological constant (aka dark energy)? From the Friedmann equation one sees that the Hubble constant reaches a final constant value of $c\sqrt{\Lambda/3}$ or about 40% higher than its present value. Eventually, in billions of years, the CMB will shift from $3^oK$ to much lower and then the CMB will fade (redshift) away. After that, those new distant galaxies will also fade away. And then more and more of the universe will go dim. 

Atmospheric transmission: FAST observes in a wavelength regime in which our atmosphere is quite transparent. In contrast, the ALMA dishes are located in one of the driest deserts of the world at an altitude of over 5000 m, in order to minimize the effects of water vapour in the atmosphere. Collecting area: FAST has a much larger collecting area. Also (I'm uncertain in this point, please correct this if I'm wrong) you lose some sensitivity when doing interferometry compared to just pooling the collecting areas of the single telescopes in ALMA. 

First off, I'm not going to calculate an answer to the "significance level of 1%" part. This is more a rule of thumb kind of answer. We're moving in a spaceship and want to see 

In other words, the red- and blueshift due to our motion must exceed the peculiar motion of the individual galaxies. Cosmologists have been dealing with a very similar problem trying to measure the Hubble constant. I remember from a cosmology class (can't find a source at the moment) that the Coma cluster is the first cluster whose redshift is dominated by the Hubble flow as opposed to peculiar motion. This is mainly due to the fact that the local group is moving towards the nearer Virgo cluster. From the above wikipedia link: Distance ca. $100 \textrm{MPc}$, apparent recession velocity ca. $7000 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$. So, at that speed, you would definitely see a systematic difference in redshift of galaxies ahead of and behind you. How long to get to that speed at constant acceleration of $10 \frac{m}{s^2}$? \begin{equation} a = \frac{v}{t} \Rightarrow t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{7\cdot 10^6 m s^{-1}}{10 m s^{-2}} = 7 \cdot 10^5 s \simeq 8\, \textrm{days.} \end{equation} Note that this is a worst-case scenario. People have used much closer galaxies to determine the Hubble constant. This paper's abstract says 

The resolution of a telescope is the resolution of the image created by the primary mirror at the focal plane. It provides the minimum separation between two equal brightness stars that appear separate in that image. Often, astronomers put a photographic plate or a CCD at the focal plane, create long exposure photos and these can then be examined at arbitrary resolution (with a magnifying glass, microscope, or zoom software on a screen). But, no matter how much you magnify the image, stars separated by less than the resolution will appear merged. It is true that if you use, say, a wide-angle lens when observing directly with a telescope the resolution that you get can be limited by the resolution of your eye. What is happening is the telescope is forming an image on your retina that has the full resolution, but your eye cannot make use of the finest details. On the other hand, a hawk looking through the same eyepiece may get full resolution benefits since hawks' eyes have better resolution than humans'. 

The first two have to do with the spin of the planet with respect to the remote stars and therefore the complexity of the stellar system does not enter, to first approximation. The 'stellar day' depends on how much time it takes for some remote galaxy, for instance, to come back to the same point in the sky as seen by an observer on the planet. The 'sidereal day' depends on how much time it takes for the direction that is at the extension of the equator of the planet with the plane of the orbit (pick 1 of the 2 points) to come back to the same point in the sky. So presuming that the spin axis and orbital plane are not changing much (and conservation of angular momentum law helps here), this is all well defined. If the planet's orbital plane is changing rapidly then there simply is no well defined sidereal day, but still there would be a valid stellar day. The 'mean solar day' is the average time it takes for the nearest star to return to the same spot in the sky. Generally, even in a binary or triple system, the planet is close enough to one that this is well defined. This is because, if not, the planet is probably not in a stable orbit and will quickly leave the system. However, if the stars are in a tight configuration and the planet's orbit is wide and far enough away from them, it could be stable. Then the simplest definition for 'mean solar day' would use the center of mass of the stellar system instead of the nearest star (which would change over time). There are a few stable complicated orbits, like a figure 8 orbit, where the planet can switch back and forth between two stars. Unlikely, but theoretically possible. In such a case, the mean solar day is ill-defined, but the stellar and sidereal day are well defined. 

so they seem to have repeat observations a bit more often than once a month. Cepheids have a period of typically 2 to 45 days (says german Wikipedia - didn't find it in the english article). If your sampling is regular, you should be able to get a decent light curve for at least some Cepheids. Complete guesswork on my part: Apparently, longer period Cepheids are redder at the minimum. Perhaps they use that to distinguish between the actual period and higher harmonics? 

Like the other answer stated, stars usually emit a good approximation to black body radiation. However, under certain conditions, a star can emit monochromatic microwaves. This is known as a MASER. For this to happen, the star has to be either very cool (since the emission is from molecular gas) or embedded in a star forming region - in the latter case, it's not the actual star emitting the radiation but the molecular cloud it is embedded in. Now, the "normal" starlight is still present even if you have a MASER, and the emission is highly directional. So you might not see the MASER if you're looking from the wrong direction at the star, and it will not be purely monochromatic, but the MASER emission might be quite dominant. 

Surprisingly, we will soon be able to do this well enough to go back several hundred million years and place ourselves, if not in the solar system, inside the Galaxy and roughly in the right part of the Galaxy. It turns out that we know, with high accuracy, the Earth's motion with respect to the microwave background radiation, which provides a well defined frame of reference for motions. Therefore, we will be able to work out which direction and about how far the MW has moved with respect to this universal frame and separately the Earth with respect to the center of the galaxy. It requires solving for the growth of what is called the 'microwave dipole velocity' over time. Some of this velocity develops from nearby objects like the MW and the nearby groups of galaxies. So, we need to know their masses and relative motions a bit better than we presently do. But, by far, most of the velocity is from objects quite far away, and this allows us to use the simpler and well understood 'perturbation' techniques. The biggest uncertainty for the Earth's position might be the interactions with local stars back in time and what effects they had on perturbing the Suns orbital motion about the center of the galaxy. Again we need to know better the masses of local stars and their relative velocities to calculate the Earth's trajectory back in time. As it happens, the space telescope GAIA, which is about to make its second release of data, will greatly improve our knowledge of the motions and, indirectly, the masses of all these stars and nearby galaxies. So, if you have got that time machine working, we are nearly ready to go! 

Yes, astronomers call it Faraday rotation. The polarization angle of radio waves changes dependent on the wavelength because of the galactic magnetic field. Sunglasses do not polarize radio waves, the wavelength is too large. You can polarize radio waves with a wire mesh. 

That should be in western China, since all of China uses Beijing's time zone. Reference: $URL$ --- Edit below --- In response to the comment by @adrianmcmenamin: I'll leave this as guesswork since I simply don't know the peculiarities of every timezone there is. Here's a back-of-the-envelope calculation for local noon in western China. The Sun covers 15 degrees in a period of 1 hour. All of China is on Beijing time (UTC + 8 hours). With the above, it's centred on $15 \cdot 8 = 120^{\circ}$ east. As a consistency check, Beijing is at $116^{\circ}$ east. The westernmost part of China is at about $73^\circ$ east (See here). Local noon there is delayed by $(120^\circ - 73^\circ)/(15^\circ/h) \simeq 3h$. So, local noon is a little later than 3pm. This is discounting daylight savings time, which is not currently observed in China. 

No, the more I read about it, the more difficult it seems to be. In principle, if you sample regularly and often, you should eventually get a light curve, unless the period is the same as or a multiple of your sampling period. It's not easy to find how often GAIA observes a given patch of sky, but here it says that after one year of observing 

Modern astronomers are not instructed on the constellations and pay little attention to them except as a naming convention for stars. Positional information is nearly always either equatorial (ra,dec), or galactic (gl,gb), or supergalactic (SGL, SGB). To improve the speed in which information on a region can be extracted from a database, a scheme called Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM), is often used. The sky is divided into three sections (0,1,2) and each of those is divided into 3 sections (00,01,02,10,11...) and this iterated until the level of finest size is reached. One can address the finest region by using all of the digits or a larger region by dropping some of the final digits. 

The tide would be locked in place, roughly, because the Moon always shows the same side to the Earth (tidally locked). But the height of the water at the location facing the Earth and the opposite side should be greater than the mean height, and at the limb, as we see it, the height will be lower than the mean but by half the magnitude of the high tide. Imagine installing a pipe with cross-section 1 cm$^2$ from the top of the ocean at its high point down to the center of the moon and then back up to the top of the ocean at a point where the net tidal field from the Earth is 0. Fill it with water until one side is equal with the water level on one side and its level on the other side will automatically be equal to the water level there. The weights of the water on both sides need to be equal if it is static. For now, we will ignore that g changes when one gets deep into the moon. Therefore, roughly speaking $\rho$gh should be the same in both sections of the pipe, and: $$ \rho(g_M - g_t)(h_t + r_M) = \rho g_M r_M $$ where $g_t$ is tidal acceleration $$ g_t(Moon) = 2\frac{GM_Er_M}{d^3}. $$ Subscript M means Moon and E means Earth and d is the separation between the Earth and Moon. Solving for h$_t$ gives: $$ h_t = \frac{g_tr_M}{g_M - g_t} \sim \frac{g_t}{g_M}r_M $$ We could substitute values in here, but if we do this in comparison with the height of the tide on the Earth, 54 cm, we cancel out some of the error in the approximation and get an even simpler formula, namely, $$ \frac{h_t(Moon)}{h_t(Earth)} = \frac{M_E}{M_M} \frac{g_E}{g_M} \Big(\frac{r_M}{r_E}\Big)^2 $$ The mass of the Earth is 81.3 time greater, the acceleration at the surface of the Moon is 1/6.25 of Earth's g force, and the diameter of the Moon is 0.2725 of the Earth. So, that is 81.3*6.25*.2725$^2$ = 37.7 time higher than the Earth's tide or 37.7*54 cm = 20.4 meters. Note that the height of the ocean does not matter as long as it is considerably more than 20 meters. On the other hand, the water would begin boiling since it is at 0 pressure until a water atmosphere is created, but the moon is too small to hold an atmosphere for long and the whole ocean would be gone in a while. 

The half-light radius doesn't change if you go from an upper end of 1000 to 100 or even to 10. It does change quite dramatically, though, if you change the resolution from 1 to 0.1 to 0.01. If we increase it to 0.001, it starts to slowly stabilize. This brings us to the next problem: These are the results I get when I increase the resolution: 

Basics: FAST is a "classic" filled aperture telescope. This means it consists of a single large dish that focuses incoming radio waves on a single receiver (this is simplified). In contrast, ALMA is an interferometer: Many (> 60) dishes each focus incoming radiation on their own receiver. The relative positions of the individual telescopes is known to great precsion, and both amplitude and phase of the incoming radiation measured, which allows astronomers to combine several or all of the telescopes for a single observation. The maximum achievable resolution is then not determined by the diameter of a telescope but by the distance between those furthest apart. (Again, this is greatly simplified; interferometry is complicated.) In principle, FAST could also become part of a huge interferometer called VLBA. Wavelength: FAST is a "classic" radio telescope, observing in the centimeter to meter wavelength range. ALMA is a sub-mm telescope operating at smaller wavelengths of 0.3 mm to about 1 cm. Resolution: since the resolution is $ \propto \lambda / d$, with $\lambda$ the wavelength and $d$ the diameter of the telescope, ALMA has a much higher resolution - smaller $\lambda$ and greater $d$. ALMAs resolution is given as 10 milliarcseconds, while in the ideal case FASTs is $1.22 \cdot 0.1 / 500 \cdot( 180 / \pi \cdot 3600) = 50$ arcseconds at 10 cm wavelength. For comparison, according to wikipedia the unaided human eye has a resolution of about 60 arcseconds. Sensitivity: 

Transmission gratings on their own introduce chromatic aberration. This is because they change the effective focal length and do so as a function of wavelength. The chromatic aberration can be eliminated by introducing a prism of the correct dispersion. Known as a grism, the grating/prism combination provides an unaberrated image at the 0th order in addition to the spectrum, although the spectrum has fairly low resolution. 

I think the biggest issue is the precision of the photometry. The atmospheric turbulence limits ground-based photometric precision to 1%. In space, Kepler achieved about 0.001% on bright stars over a few hours. This precision is needed to detect an earth-sized planet transiting a sun-sized star. 

The sunlight intensity is the cosine of the sun's elevation angle $\alpha$. How to calculate the position of the sun is described simply at PVEducation.com. To summarize the relevant equations: $\alpha$ is given by, $$\alpha = \arcsin[sin\delta\sin\phi+cos\delta\cos\phi\cos(HRA)]$$ where $\delta$ is the declination angle of the sun: $$\delta = -23.45^\circ \times \cos\left[\frac{360}{365}(d+10)\right]. $$ $\phi$ is the latitude, d is the day of the year (Jan 1 is 1), and HRA is the hour angle: $$HRA = 15^\circ(LST-12).$$ LST is the Local Standard Time. This should simulate the intensity of light hitting level surfaces throughout the year, however to be really natural one would have to change the position of the lighting (according to these equation) rather than the intensity because early morning and late evening mean a low sun to me rather than a low intensity sun.
