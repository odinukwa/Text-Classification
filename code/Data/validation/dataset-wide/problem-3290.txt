Irish clann "plant; offspring; child" (the source of English clan) is borrowed from Welsh plant with the same meanings, which is itself a borrowing of Latin planta. Why did Irish change the initial p into c? PIE p was lost in Celtic, so the explanation I've seen given is that Irish did not have initial p at the time of the borrowing. But this leads to other questions: 

kratêrés eisin ... hôn krât' érepson "There are mixing bowls ... the rims of which fill!" (="the rims of which you must fill") oîsth' hò drâson? "Do you know what do (impv.)?" (="Do you know what you are to do / what I'm telling you to do?") 

The Attic-Ionic dialects of Ancient Greek underwent a sound change whereby, in a sequence of a long vowel followed by a short vowel, the quantities were switched: -V:V- became -VV:-, e.g. -e:o- > -eo:-. Has a metathesis of this kind occurred -- or does it occur as a synchronic process -- in any other language? 

The answer mostly has to do with the specific history of how the Romans acquired and adapted their alphabet, rather than with any particular features of Latin itself. The Roman alphabet was derived from the Etruscan alphabet, which in turn was derived from the Greek alphabet (which in turn was derived from the Phoenician alphabet, but we don't really need to go that far back for our purposes). The answers to your first three questions all have to do with sounds which the Greek and/or Etruscan languages happened to lack, and which therefore weren't written in those alphabets. 

Does this construction exist in early Indo-European languages (e.g. Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Hittite)? If not, how do these languages express such meanings? What syntactic and semantic analyses of such clauses (in any language) have been proposed? They have the unusual property of not having an antecedent and modifying an otherwise syntactically independent sentence, which is odd for relative clauses. 

Putting all these features together, you arrive at breathy voiced stops. That said, this conclusion is far from unproblematic: first, because only one sub-branch (Indic) then actually preserves the original sounds into the historical period, which is maybe a bit strange; second and more importantly, because the system of contrasts that you end up with for PIE stops (voiceless / voiced / breathy voiced) is cross-linguistically either extremely rare or nonexistent. So it's still an unsolved problem. 

It is an iambic trimeter, with synezesis in θεῶν (i.e. it counts as a single long) and resolution in πατρίδα (i.e. its first two shorts are equivalent to a single long). The τε counts long because of the following initial rho. The foot boundaries look like this: 

The Abbreviations list of that book is viewable (if you search for "abbreviations"), and says "A = agent-like argument of transitive clause" and "S = single argument of intransitive clause". 

As to the definition wikipedia, agglutinative language Esperanto indeed is highly-agglutinative. And "malsanulejo" (there exists a hundred year old alternative, but rare, "hospitalo") indeed is often cited by both the pro and contra E-o factions. Having the same stem and same endings for deriving adjective , noun , verb () is one property. For E-o this has a funny effect on the "internationality," but assumedly makes the language easier for members of other language families. The "highly" makes only sense with sufficient affixes being used: 

Low threshhold: internet news, internet television, subtitled movies. Reading of light lecture. Passover in the country, at best something like a pen pal conference, goal oriented (whatever is of your interest). Quiet tourist evading others, in a pension. To the flash cards, which one acquires relatively passively. Try stories, sentences, fibulation. Talk to yourself. Finding a native speaker and making it work is hard for me. Maybe sit in on a group of native speakers, if they meet in a student café, to at least learn by hearing. 

(It goes without say, that I personally still see some viral power in Esperanto. It would at least cost least effort, go fast and provide quality. A nice light-weight second language.) 

The English perhaps: can happen, and the Dutch misschien (geschieden): might happen have similar roots. The German vielleicht seems to deviate on first sight, but there is the Dutch wel-licht with the same meaning: "yes easily (possible)" - wel = indeed, yes, yeah (compare the English well). Both vielleicht and wellicht stem from the same spoken form evidently. 

For this scenario to happen, something drastic has to happen in China. Maybe some reform. As China is a major driving power in the world. Conclusion: I doubt the future will take this course. Considering the parallels with the decline of French, and the smaller world, English will dominate for another 20 - 30 years. World resources are draining in absolute numbers. So it may well be a world crisis turns over our international culture in another direction. Hopefully not Basic English with reformed spelling. 

In general language standardisation happens after changes in the language communities. Only reforms in Chinese is a counter-example. The impetus of changes derives of the cultural changes in the communities. Historical American English and Brazilian Portugues changed faster. One language with many more or less isolated communities (historic Greek), isolated Portuguese in Portugal and Brasil. Small Dutch/Flanders may have easier reforms. Regulation like revisions, and cross-community standardisation, are conservative (though still receive much opposition). Take the reform of German where some occurrences of (but not all) were replaced by . Regulation authorities are seldom speeding things up to a larger degree. In general they start to allow new orthography and finally make some new spelling the standard. They also cannot really hinder new cultural terms. The dictionary though intending to be non-regulative, in fact is regulative. As people tend to follow spelling and word choice as provided in the dictionaries. Conclusion: The mosquito steering the elephant. Though language regulation is linguistically important, its controlling function (negative or positive) depends on other factors, like the Chinese in the past wanting to do a huge simplification. 

After a bit of searching I can now partially answer my own question 1, about these constructions in Latin and Greek: apparently both have basically the same construction as English, using an indefinite relative pronoun (usually quisquis in Latin, ὅστις or ὁστισοῦν in Greek) and a verb in the indicative. Latin: hostem qui feriet, mihi erit Carthaginiensis, quisquis erit 'whoever kills an enemy will be a Carthaginian in my eyes, whoever he may be' (Cicero Balbus 22.51) ita ille faxit Iuppiter, ut ille palam ibidem adsiet, quisquis illest, qui adest a milite 'I wish Jupiter would so make it, that he were openly in the same place with me, whoever he is, that has arrived from the Captain' (Plautus Pseudolus 4.1.22-4) Greek: δεινῶς γ᾽ ἔοικεν ἀποκεκρυμμένην τέχνην ἀνευρεῖν ὁ Τεισίας ἢ ἄλλος ὅστις δή ποτ᾽ ὢν τυγχάνει καὶ ὁπόθεν χαίρει ὀνομαζόμενος 'a wonderfully hidden art it seems to be which Tisias has brought to light, or some other, whoever he may be and whatever country he is proud to call his own!' (Plato Phaedrus 273c) Greek additionally has a slightly different construction which places the free relative clause inside a conditional: μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ ἀσεβοῦντι μηδ᾽ ἂν ὁστισοῦν τυγχάνῃ ὤν '[we ought not] to let him who acts impiously go unpunished, no matter who he may be', lit. 'not even if he happens to be whoever'. (Plato Euthyphro 5e) 

In neither language is this the normal construction for counterfactuals, but it's common enough in both that anyone with an eighteenth-century classical education would have been likely to encounter it, and it's odd enough to stick in one's memory as a neat rhetorical effect, so my guess is that Gibbon, whose style is highly classicizing, copied this usage from classical authors he was familiar with. 

There's no single agreed definition of "linguistic distance" or method of calculating it, so it depends what you mean by that term. For an intuitive sense of "linguistic distance" which negatively correlates with similarity and mutual intelligibility, the difference between Ancient Greek and these modern languages is pretty close to maximal. Their structures are extremely different and there is zero mutual intelligibility. Even though there are numerous cognates between Greek and these languages, those words have changed so much in both sound and meaning as to be unrecognizable for the most part except to specialists. If you're asking for a lexicostatistical measure of difference, which only asks how many cognates the languages have in common, then the difference would be smaller. I don't have a number for you, but searching for "Indo-European lexicostatistics" could get you started. 

A possible hypothesis is that words for "yes" tend to undergo replacement faster than words for "no". Think of the various near-synonyms for "yes" in contemporary English: "sure", "definitely", "absolutely", etc. If one of these were to become so common that it takes over from "yes", then the English for "yes" would no longer look like (for example) German ja. On the other hand, synonyms for "no" tend either to be phonetic variants of "no" ("nope", "naw") or to contain "no" ("not really"), so if one of those became the standard word for "no", it would still look related to nein.
