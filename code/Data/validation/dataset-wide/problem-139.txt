1 Bombers now are designed with escape routes and landing gear doors that do not involve electricity and can be operated manually. Same goes for fighters. 

To the Greeks, the use of flight sounds a bit like Helios (though Daedalus (a human) could also do it, do some extent). The fire sounds like the work of Prometheus (a Titan). The mysterious voices coming from nowhere could be the Anemoi (basically wind gods) whispering. The robots could be the work of Daedalus). These miracles could be the work of any of a number of mythical figures put together. 

I decided to start working on my own answer after I asked the question, so here's the result of a few days' work. An excellent (and very recent) paper regarding accretion is Debnath (2015), which can be applicable at least for material gathered onto the surface of the red dwarf. Debnath assumes a static1, spherically symmetric metric: $$ds^2=-A(r)dt^2+\frac{1}{B(r)}dr^2+r^2(d \theta^2+ \sin \theta d \phi^2) \tag{1}$$ which uses the (-,+,+,+) sign convention. For now, we can leave $A$ and $B$ undetermined functions of $r$. We have to treat the surrounding matter as a perfect fluid, with a stress-energy tensor of $$T_{\mu \nu}=(\rho+p)u_{\mu}u_{\nu}+pg_{\mu \nu} \tag{2}$$ with $\rho$ and $p$ being the density and pressure, respectively.2 $u_{\alpha}$ is the four-vector, with the condition that $u_{\alpha}u^{\alpha}=-1$. For this fluid, though, $$u^{\alpha}=(u^0,u^1,0,0)$$ We can then re-write the earlier condition as $$g_{00}u^0u^0+g_{11}u^1u^1=-1$$ Substituting in that $g_{00}=g_{tt}=A(t)$ and $g_{11}=g_{rr}=\frac{1}{B(t)}$, as well as assuming (for simplicity) that $u^1=u$, we get $$\left(u^0\right)^2=\frac{\left(u^1\right)^2+B}{AB} \to u_0=g_{00}u^0=\sqrt{\frac{A(u^2+B)}{B}}$$ We can also calculate $\sqrt{-g}=\sqrt{\frac{A}{B}}r^2 \sin \theta$. The law of conservation of energy states that $u{_\mu}T_{; \nu}^{\mu \nu}=0$.3 Putting this together with $(2)$ gives $$u^{\mu} \rho_{, \mu}+(\rho+p)u_{; \mu}^{\mu}=0$$ Doing it out, we find that $$C=-ur^2M^{-2}\sqrt{\frac{A}{B}} \exp \left[\int_{\rho_{\infty}}^{\rho_R} \frac{1}{\rho + p(\rho)} d \rho\right] \tag{3}$$ where $\rho_R$ is the density at the radius of the red dwarf and $C$ is a constant (which will be used later). The rate of change of mass of the black hole, $\dot{M}$ (the negative rate of change of the mass of the fluid) is expressed as4 $$\dot{M}=\int T_0^1dS \tag{4}$$ where $$dS=\sqrt{-g}d \theta d \phi$$ From $(2)$, we get $$\dot{M}=4 \pi CM^2(\rho + p) \tag{5}$$ Abramowicz & Fragile (2013) give a slightly different expression in place of $(4)$ (Equation 125): $$\dot{M} = \int \sqrt{-g} \rho u^r d \theta d \phi \tag{6}$$ and use $(5)$ for the energy flux. Both expressions are applied to jets on black hole accretion disks. Working off of Debnath, the total mass transferred to the red dwarf's surface is $$M=\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \left[\int \sqrt{-g} \rho u^r d \theta d \phi \right] dt \tag{7}$$ where $t_0$ and $t_f$ are the initial and final times during which the red dwarf accretes material. I haven't quite figured out the full Roche lobe calculations just yet, but I was able to find some of the major equations. Paczynski (1971) mentions that the radius of the Roche lobe of the red dwarf is $$r_1=\left[\frac{2}{3^{4/3}} \left(\frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2} \right)^{1/3} \right]A \tag{8}$$ where $M_1$ is the mass of the red dwarf and $M_2$ is the mass of the B-type star, and $A$ is the distance between them. The issue is that this is typically applied in binary systems, while, presumably, the red dwarf is traveling at a speed greater than the B-type star's escape velocity. It is, therefore, not orbiting it. So I'm not sure if the formula is valid. Let's say that the civilization places a planet-sized object into the disk, inserting it at an orbital velocity $V_0$. It would then undergo Bondi accretion, as shown in Bondi (1951).5 In that paper, he goes from the expressions derived by Hoyle & Littleton and Bondi & Hoyle to get the accretion rate of $$\dot{M} = 2 \pi (GM)^2 (v^2 + c_s^2)^{-3/2} \rho \tag{9}$$ where $v$ is relative to the fluid. Taking the limit as $v \to 0$ gives the approximation shown on Wikipedia, although it differs by a factor of 2. We can't just use this, though, because there are other things to consider. First, all the gas and dust in the disk is orbiting at the same rate as this object, so $V_0 \neq v$. Second, the conditions change. For each orbit the object makes, the density of the matter in the path through the disk changes, because it has been swept up. Finally, the object may be severely affected by Stokes drag. The density issue can be dealt with by simply assigning the object a number of orbits $n$ at time $t$, and saying that during each orbit, it accretes $x$ percent of the gas and dust in its way. Once this is known, an expression can be derived for the accretion during each orbit. The Stokes drag is slightly more interesting. As shown in a derivation by Gavnholt et. al. (2004), the formula is $$D=6 \pi \mu U a \left(1+\frac{3Re}{8} \right) \tag{10}$$ where $U=v$, $a$ is the object's radius, $\mu$ is the viscosity and $Re$ is the Reynolds number. This means that $$\frac{dv}{dt} \propto v$$ Knowing that, and placing the object in a circular orbit such that $$F_g=F_c \to G\frac{M_sm_o}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$ where $M_s$ is the mass of the B-type star, $m_o$ is the mass of the object and $r$ is the distance between them. we can write $v$ as a function of time and then solve for $r$ as a function of $v$, eventually witnessing orbital decay. Also, if $\rho$ is a function of $r$, we can further complicate everything. This also goes for the accretion experienced by the red dwarf. I feel bad about not doing any actual calculations (i.e. with actual numbers), so I'll discuss a special case here: A dust disk surrounding a spherically symmetric body. In a dust solution, $p=0$, so our generic equation of state $p=p(\rho)$ goes to 0. Imposing spherically symmetry means that $A=B$. Accounting for all this turns $(3)$ into $$C=-r^2uM^{-2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{1}} \exp \left[ \int_{\rho_{\infty}}^{\rho_R} \frac{1}{\rho + 0} d \rho \right]$$ $$=-r^2uM^{-2} \exp \left[ \ln \frac{\rho_R}{\rho_{\infty}} \right]$$ $$=-r^2uM^{-2} \frac{\rho_R}{\rho_{\infty}} $$ Plugging this into $(5)$ gives us $$\dot{M}=-4 \pi r^2u \frac{\rho_R}{\rho_{\infty}} \rho$$ Just take a given $\rho$, pick a velocity, and solve for $\dot{M}$. I still haven't put in any numbers, but it's at the point where you don't have to do much to find the result. Accretion by planetary-mass objects in debris disk has been observed, such as in Epsilon Eridani's debris disk (Greaves et. al. (2005); explored also by Backman et. al. (2008)). A good overview of the process is given by Janson et. al. (2013), while it was simulated by Stark & Kuchner (2009) and Nesvold & Kuchner (2014). The only issue now is to establish whether or not a Type II civilization could build such an object. 

Using this envision, two typical speakers talking about a relatively common subject. Go through it in your head in your native language, and figure out what words you'll need. Many dialogues will have some common features, even if the precise content differs. Again, there will be common speech patterns and shared phrasing. The reason I would choose a conversation over a word list is that the most common words in English may not be the most necessary words in this language. Various factors will influence which words are essential for every conversation (which is why I gave greetings as an example), and which ones aren't. Frequency is not always the best determination of importance. 

Hereâ€™s Figure 2, the results of some of the simulations in the same conditions but with that tiny change in the orbit of one of the planetesimals: 

I know, the image is tiny, and so the captions aren't readily visible, but the link should help. Anyway, the yellow one is the Gran Telescopio Canarias, and it's the biggest optical telescope in the world. At only 10.4 meters. Yep, there are bigger things in the image. The Thirty-Meter Telescope, the European Extremely Large Telescope, and the Giant Magellan Telescope are all still planned . . . but not ready until the early 2020s. The large pale outline is that of the creatively named Overwhelmingly Large Telescope - cancelled. And the big white thing is the Arecibo Observatory, which - while, in my opinion, one of humanity's most extraordinary feats of engineering - can only detect radio waves. Anyway, there's a rather large problem, which is that there is a limit to how big you can make mirrors. Notice how all of the big telescopes are actually composed of smaller mirrors. Whole mirrors that size simply can't support their own weight while still being scratch-free and in the desired shape (parabolic). Now, the biggest of these still-in-the-pipeline telescopes, the European Extremely Large Telescope - ironically planned for construction in Chile - is 39.3 meters across, and will be composed of 789 hexagonal segments. A telescope on your scale would require hundreds of thousands of times that amount - because the number doesn't increase linearly. There are advances in larger mirrors, but you'd still need loads of mirrors 20 meters across to create just one 160-meter-wide telescope. Is this possible? Yes. Feasible? No. Operable? Most likely not. Each mirror segment needs actuators to help it adjust to make miniscule changes, correcting for various effects. The actuator system for such a large mirror would be enormous, and I doubt that you could successfully take many images without some problem cropping up with a segment or two - or maybe a hundred or two hundred. Complex systems are always susceptible to disaster. 

Prevent contamination. Contamination is something that NASA and other space agencies are careful about when sending rovers to other planets (e.g. Mars). Rovers could accidentally release bacteria from Earth, thereby making it harder to tell if organic material is from Mars or from Earth. Returning samples to Earth is also a problem, as there is an even greater risk there. Ideas have been proposed to solve this problem. However, it would take a while to prepare: 

I wrote an answer on Physics Stack Exchange that discussed this a bit. I'll present a shorter and more focused version here. There are two main processes by which a planet can lose atmosphere: Jeans escape (for lighter particles) and dissociation/non-thermal escape (for heavier particles). Jeans escape The speeds of particles in an atmosphere are not uniform, but follow a statistical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This means that some particles will have speeds greater than the escape velocity of the body at a given point, and these particles may escape the atmosphere. This motion is due to temperature, and so it is called thermal escape, or Jeans escape. The Jeans flux of escaping particles of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of the planet is $$\phi_J(m)\propto n_c\sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}}\left(1+\frac{GMm}{kTr}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{GMm}{kTr}\right)\tag{1}$$ where $T$ is temperature, $M$ is the mass of the planet, and $k$ and $G$ are constants. Now, escape velocity at a distance $r$ is given by $$v_e=v_e(r)=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\implies \frac{GM}{r}=\frac{v_e^2}{2}$$ We can therefore make some substitutions into $(1)$ and get $$\phi_J(m)\propto n_c\sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}}\left(1+\frac{v_e^2m}{2kT}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{v_e^2m}{2kT}\right)\tag{2}$$ Let's say that the planet is Earth-like and the particles are molecular hydrogen (and thus likely to escape). We then have $$T\simeq288\text{ K},\quad m=3.3\times10^{-27}\text{ kg}\implies \frac{m}{2kT}\simeq4.15\times10^{-7}\text{s}^{-2}\text{ m}^{-2}$$ Therefore, $$\phi_J(m)\propto 1552n_c\left(1+4.15\times10^{-7}v_e^2\right)\exp\left(-4.15\times10^{-7}v_e^2\right)$$ Graphing this shows that planets with higher escape velocities have lower particle fluxes, and thus should retain more of their atmospheres. Conceptually, this should make sense. If two sets of particles have the same speed distribution, more will have speeds above the lower escape velocity than above the higher escape velocity. Surface gravity on the whole does not matter because there are other variable parameters in play, as Cyrus wrote. Escape velocity at a certain radius (not necessarily at the surface) is the quantity you want to look at here. Non-thermal escape A planet can lose heavier atoms and molecules (such as $\text{O}_2$ and $\text{O}^+$) through processes involving the solar wind and the magnetosphere, which dissociate (i.e. break up) heavier molecules into ions and lighter molecules. This is one way Earth loses $\text{O}^+$ ions, mostly in the polar regions. The same can happen on other planets, including Mars and Venus. Obviously, mass and escape velocity matter here, but properties of the magnetic field (if the planet has one) may be much more important. We can assume that otherwise similar two planets with different escape velocities/surface gravities would lose gas roughly equally in this way. 

Agriculture Okay, back to farming. It's hard to grow corn in the Himalayas. Just think about that sentence for a while. Crops are incredibly important to a civilization, and so humans will also settle where there is room to grow food. The Three Sisters (corn, squash, and beans) were important to the indigenous people of North America. They could be grown in a variety of regions, from rocky New England to the sunny Midwest. Sure, they needed a certain climate to thrive in, but open land was another factor. Can you grow corn in the Rocky Mountains or in the eastern woodlands? I didn't think so. So open land definitely draws people. Livestock I hope that satisfied all the vegans out there, because they aren't going to like this next bit. The other good thing about open land is that animals like it, too. The tribes of the North American plains used it to their advantage by hunting buffalo. Later on, cattle ranchers drove out the tribes and used the land to raise cattle. Both groups were drawn by the allure of open land and the possibilities it held. Why waste your time staring at corn kernels when you can just go out and kill a buffalo?
