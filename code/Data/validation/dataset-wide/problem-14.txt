I think the issue can be easily thought about by using different stats. There are more black people in prison than whites in countries with a mix of races. Does this mean black people are inclined to be criminal more than white people and should we chain black people up to reduce crime rates? Of course this is fallacious - sure, there are more black men in prison than white men, but the idea that being black in itself makes you more likely to be criminal is stupid. So the reasons for the difference in prison population must be attributed to other factors - lifestyle, upbringing, social pressure etc, and not genetics. So, does this mean that women do not commit more crimes because they are in fact made of sugar and spice, or because the same social pressures and lifestyle choices preclude them from committing crimes? I'd say yes. There is evidence that domestic violence towards men is significantly under-reported, and more prevalent in lesbian relationships. this suggests that women do not commit acts of violence simply because they do not think they would win, but in environments where they are more comfortable with the potential outcome, they are just as violent as men (and often more dangerous as they are more likely to use weapons than fists) So your question - can we "neuter" men to reduce crime... no. If you want to reduce crime, you need to consider other factors. Is there something more in common with criminals (as I understand the majority of crime is committed by a very few people - I recall "blip boy" who was so-called because when he was released or escaped from youth custody, the crime stats would increase significantly, causing a blip in the graphs). Is there something in poverty (unlikely as there are very rich criminals too), or is there something in the detection or justice system that doesn't deter these people? I can't answer any of those, but there's probably a bit of truth to all of them, that's where you should focus your crime-fighting efforts. 

In importance terms, none of them are individually important - they are all 1 man in a squad or team of others. So 100 fighter squad is considered as important as the 100 crewmen of the capship. That means its not the ship that sets the story, but the individual acting within the group that develops the storyline. You should ignore what the ship is capable of relative to the other ships and consider the impact of either the interpersonal relations within the respective groups, or (if you must bring the ships into it) of the ships relative importance within the fleet. The fighter squadrons have as much importance within a war as a capship does, but I think you'll be losing a lot of the human story if you treat the ships are important. 

Perhaps the simplest answer is not to kill anyone, but to stop more people from being added. Bonus points for reducing the rate of replacement. So China's one child policy, if implemented globally, would easy solve the issue in 2 generations. Sure, you'd have other issues to deal with - mainly an ageing population that requires either less pension, longer working lives, or automated elderly care (all of which are solvable - pensions are dealt with by keeping elderly people working on a part-time basis, which happens in 3rd world countries anyway, or keeping them working longer as I personally know lots of people forced to retire when they didn't really want to) The net result is that the population slowly reduces. Children are better educated (as there are fewer of them and they are now considered more precious and important to be good citizens) and they in turn will have fewer children anyway because they are better educated! (This is happening in China, they will have a demographic problem in the future as, apart from the stupidity of old cultural thinking that boys were better, thus skewing the male-female ratio to an imbalanced state where the total number of male-female pairings for reproductive purposes will be constrained by the lower number of females, the female children that are born into this system have been educated and expect careers and perhaps, not even to have large families like their parents or grandparents did. So ultimately, the population will slowly stabilise, and will be an all-round "better" set of people. Your trouble is persuading everyone to do this, but the easiest way is via money. child benefit for the 1st child only and that's it, no more, will have an effect on many; in other places, families with 1 child will be entitled to government assistance for (say) elderly care so they do not need to have loads of children to look after the parents. You could ensure that 1 child families are first in the queue for state housing or jobs, etc. You don't even need to mandate 1 child, just nudge the population to have fewer children via these incentives, depending on how quickly you want to change the planetary population. In 20 years time, there will be fewer children, in 40, fewer adults, in 60 the problem will be solved. If are a villain who wants to force it on everyone, then start researching a GM virus that makes half the population infertile. Drop it in the water, job done. Make sure to double test it first! So while this doesn't kill 99% of the population, it effectively does the same job, only a lot slower by employing age to do it for you. 

You're maybe missing a point here: an elemental baby who cannot control their powers quickly kills their parents in an accidental flood/fire/etc. And then the baby dies itself, of starvation at the very least. So you either have even fewer elemental people being raised, perhaps lucky enough to get to an age where they can fend for themselves, and end up running wild - thus elemental adults are loners, or outcast from society they were never part of in the first place; or you have to change the scenario so that these babies don't develop their powers until they're older (usually puberty is common). Of course this also allows for the idea that elemental adults might try to find and adopt these destructive babies (assuming that an elemental adult can avoid being killed by the same elements they can handle) to build a form of society for themselves or to protect the society of the everyday folk. Interesting stories to consider: The film Looper has a child in it that has powers. Also A World of Ptavvs that concerns itself with a society of entities with powers that could provoke more thought on how society would develop. PS. In Runequest (IIRC) Elves stop ageing (past puberty) whilst they live in their forest, which gives a reason for both immortality and why they mostly stay put and don't venture out too often, and why you can have both old and young elf people. 

They don't all have long carrier flight decks, though there are ones like Battlestar Galactica that have fast-deployment rail tubes to shoot the fighters out at high speed, presumably to get them far away from the carrier and into action asap without using the fighter's fuel reserve. Other sci-fi places have a more realistic approach, such as Babylon 5, seen here launching StarFuries in this youtube clip. 

I think the simple answer here is to understand that no power is ever absolute. King Charles I was an absolute monarch, yet still got his head cut off. King John was an absolute monarch but the barons still told him to sign the Magna Carta (or else!) There are ways of using this - while the King has absolute power, it effectively can be limited in many ways by political means. For example, after the English Restoration, the King was absolute, but he gave parliament various powers over boring stuff, like raising and collecting taxes. As a result, although the King had power over everything, if he wanted to go to war, he had to ask Parliament nicely, and then it was up to them to refuse (rarely happened, but by god did they extract various promises from the King in return) or delay collection. So you have a democratically elected parliament, and you have an absolute power king. None of which gets to exercise that power without restriction. If you want absolute freedom for the king as well, you're pretty much looking at a pre-law society. (IIRC Capet was the first king to set down laws that also bound himself), once you start making laws like that, you open a can of worms that grows. Guilds get little exemptions or powers for themselves that they then guard and little islands of power grow. Gives endless scope for plots! 

As answered have said - there needs to be a deterrent to ensure treaties are enforced. But you don't need to revert to pre-treaty days against an adversary who breaks them. eg. Dropping chemical weapons on an adversary who has started to use them. Instead you hit them with other deterrents, such as trade embargoes or asset freezes. A country unable to trade with anyone else is either so powerful they can do what they like anyway, or will quickly crumble and end up as a feeble dictatorship followed by collapse, and either way the rulers will not be able to get and enjoy their riches as they otherwise would. I think most treaties have punishments either written into them, or the organisation managing them has deterrent powers to bring to bear, with the means to force other treaty signatories to be involved in enforcing the deterrent. In these cases, a lot of countries would find it in their interests to damage the offending country - to steal their trade or seize their assets for example. 

It depends on 2 factors really - you either want a large number of "sweet spot" trained troops, or a few "super" trained troops. The difference in skill will tell you which you need (ie, take football, you can have the super skilled Messi still be beaten by the less-well skilled League 2 team so you'd train all your troops to the easy-and-cheap-to-achieve League 2 level, but if the skill levels were so different that the top player could take on a team all by himself, them you'd want to specialise in having a couple of them). So assuming that as skill levels increase, they start to plateau and the difference is not so great, then you want a training programme for troops like we already have. You can see the difference here between troops of varying skill levels: a whole company of ill-trained troops will not be a match for a platoon of trained ones, or a handful of special forces troops. However, assuming that you have D&D style experience where a level 1 untrained grunt will easily be outclassed by a level 5 veteran, and a level 20 elite soldier will take out whole armies single-handedly, then you're n the world of superheroes, where you needn't bother with any number of ordinary armies, you'd have them for peacekeeping and civilian suppression duties, and a couple of stars. Your position in the military world would be dependant on these, a bit like any story you'd find in a Marvel or DC comic. Of course, the difference doesn't have to be down to skill: you can use technology instead. So a reasonably trained trooper can be issued with an iron-man suit (or whatever) and be a very effective fighting force by himself. In this case, you're limited to how many suits you can manufacture and support - your military might becomes one not of soldiers but of technological industrialisation. Similarly, if you developed remote-control robot troops, you don't even need soliders as you'd want them piloted by guys sitting around all day in front of a VR monitor (though ones with a good sense of discipline). In this case your battles are better fought by experienced tacticians than soldiers and your training will be more like a war game. 

Anything can make sense - it depends on the situation. For example, although Earth as plenty of iron in its crust, you still have to dig it out of there in a reasonably unpleasant manner. If you have a very overpopulated planet and need every inch for agriculture and housing, there's limited scope for creating a huge hole just to dig up iron. The difference between whether you will go for the hole or the planetary transport depends then on the cost. If transporting stuff by bulk is cheap (as in, staff costs are next to nothing, ship costs are a single sunk cost, fuel is cheap once you push it in the right direction etc), then it can be cheaper to mine asteroids and ship the refined material back home. Its the same argument for shipping shoes to the local store - is it cheaper to make them in Vietnam and transport them to your local Walmart rather than make them in a local factory? You bet - otherwise they'd be made in the local factory. For iron this might not be quite so clearcut, but for rare earth minerals the costs can make sense, particularly for minerals that are required in quantity but not available on Earth (think platinum for example). In such a case it might be cheaper to dump a huge amount of asteroid into an automated refinery and by the time it reaches earth, all the rock is chucked away and you have a ship full of refined precious metal. Of course, you then have the problem of having a huge amount of precious stuff that would be cheap if allowed onto the market at once (think diamonds that should be cheap but are currently kept expensive by the traders hoarding them) 

No reason at all, and I assume the only reason we generally have 2 eyes is for either wide field vision (in the case of prey) or distance-determining vision (in the case of predators). However, in an imaginary world, there's no reason some other form of determining your location would appear instead of a passive light sensor. Take dolphins or bats and their echo-location senses. It could be possible a species would develop in (perhaps gloomy conditions) where a light-emitting sense would be more useful than a passive light-detecting sense: a species that would flash a light and detect the results using a single eye, maybe the light emission is more directed (to avoid detection from predators) and so multiple detecting sensors would not be useful. So you can have sharks with lasers on their heads! 

Depends what you think a vampire is. If its a dead body walking around by "magic", then the energy requirements are solely that needed to keep the magic working (whatever that might be). If vampires are supernatural entities (that don't really exist, hence you cannot see them in mirrors etc) then the blood might not even be required for energy expenditure but to give them some "magical" link to the physical world we live in. Some vampire traditions require human blood - cow's blood doesn't work (or they could just live without the conflict we expect from vampires). That suggests its something special from the blood that is more supernatural in itself (ie human blood contains some magical energy that makes us sentient or 'alive', and the vampire needs this to exist rather than the physical material that makes the blood cells) I think from all mythological concepts of traditional vampires, they do not need to feed on blood like we need calorific energy from food. So the answer is all down to what kind of mechanism it is that allows a vampire to exist. 

Well, quite often they do - look to history, when our forebears were knights in armour that could kick the ass of any number of peasants armed with pointy sticks (I guess the closest analogy we have to the supernaturally powerful) They ruled like a different class. In some countries the peasants were considered property. And these powerful guys banded together to ensure their dominance. In the UK, it took the black death to break this system - when the peasants all died, the landed nobility found there was nobody left to make their sandwiches and were forced to change the system. Similarly, the first world war changed the established practices of a ruling class for a similar reason. In a fantasy setting, the only thing stopping them are other powerful entities (via war or invasion) or themselves (because they can't be bothered with the boring task of ruling, or they have different interests like the wizard who can command armies of undead simply prefers to play with his books)(note some of these guys will simply get a steward or chancellor to do the boring ruling jobs instead and he sits around as figurehead for the glory) 

There was a TV series many years ago called Ultraviolet by Joe Aherne that tried to explain everything vampiric as if it were real, though with plenty of "we don't know". It was very good - worth digging out a copy. One of the ideas is that, because a vampire has no reflection, it follows that there is no light reflecting off its body, and therefore has no physical presence that we'd recognise. So, no reflection in a mirror also means no image in a CCTV camera, or a photograph, and no ability to use other electronic devices such as a telephone. The idea is that a vampire doesn't truly exist in this world as physical matter. So why can humans see and interact with them? Possibly its a metaphysical thing, 'spiritual' forces that we can detect that physics cannot, similar to how ghosts work in the world but with a bit more power behind them. TBH it doesn't really matter exactly why, but the effects of such a situation go beyond mirrors.
