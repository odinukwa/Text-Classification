So, Constantius was a Flavius to begin with. Probably this means that there is no way to trace his name any further back, as we know next to nothing about his background and family (except that unhelpful probably-fake genealogy). Salway's paper mentions a soldier by the name Flavius Euclides, by the way. P.S. The absence of pre-nomen is not a mistake. According to Salway's theory the "New Romans" (i.e. those enfranchised in 212 by Caracalla) did not take to the use of pre-nomen outside of official documents (where most people were called M. Aurelius Something anyway, like our friend Flavius Euclides who was officially listed as M. Aurelius Flavius Euclides in his unit's roster). Read the whole paper for more fun stuff about names. 

Partial answer: this page indicates that the trials were paid for by the Control Council of Germany, aka Allied Control Council. I couldn't find an online budget for the council, but perhaps the printed 9 volumes of its papers, duly mentioned in the wiki article, contain this information. 

In the Mediterranean area, these elements were all present with the advent of Christianism. You also find them in the case of Buddhism at the time of the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution (9th century AD in China). 

There are many calendar systems, many of them still in use. It is expected that the year count in any given calendar should be less than 10000: recording of dates in a universal scale don't make a lot of sense without any written records, so the calendar scales have not been in use for more than five or six thousands of years at most; and there is an incentive to keep year counts short, if only to be able to use them in everyday administration and for engraving with minimal hassle. If you take 30 random number in the 1 to 10000 range, then it is mathematically expected that the minimum difference between any two of them will be a decade or two (this is linked with the so-called birthday paradox: if you split the 10000-year range into 500 chunks of 20 years, and take 30 uniformly random values in the range, then chances that at least two of them will fall in the same 20-year chunk will be close to 59%). Therefore, scientifically, this is perfectly compatible with a simple coincidence, and there is nothing more to explain. In other words, trying to find an "explanation" for that match of Epoch is, by nature, un-scientific. 

Presumably this would be ancient Rome during the early Empire. The best numbers available come, I think, from Augustus' official autobiography. The English text can be found here. In paragraph 8 he says that in the Empire-wide census of 14CE "were counted 4,937,000 of the heads of Roman citizens". Now, it seems to be a vexing questions for historians what this number actually means - some think it includes women and children, who could not vote. Also, a great number of the citizens didn't live in Rome so could not vote. How many voting citizens resided in Rome then? Well, in paragraph 15 Augustus goes on to say: "I gave to 320,000 plebs of the city HS 240 per man". So, I'd say 320,000 is your brutto number. How many of those actually bothered to show up for the elections? I don't know; to judge by modern participation ratios, it could be as few as 20%, i.e. 64,000. Of course, it is rather ironic that absolutely nothing hinged on the result of the elections at that time. EDIT: Playing it safely, we can go for Athens at its height. There are various estimates of how many citizens there were, but 50,000 is very near the top of the high end. There we can presume a very high participation ratio (Athens, the birthplace of direct democracy and all that). So I'd shoot at about 40,000. Maybe Republican Rome had more but not by an order of a magnitude. Perhaps experts on Roman assemblies could weigh in here. EDIT2: The modern high end estimate for Athenian citizen population is the work of Mogens Herman Hansen who developed what he calls "the shotgun method". A brief summary of the figures I was relying on can be found here. 

As @Mark points out, the Empire was too large to be efficiently managed from a single central point in the 4th century: at that time, the complete area consisted of provinciae, full of Roman citizens who had to be protected (no client state to serve as buffer), and the external borders were under high demographic pressure ("barbarians" on the other side of the Rhine/Danube boundary were more numerous and more organized than in the 2nd century). This called for fast reaction time (militarily speaking) which could not be obtained with pure centralization (or at least so it was thought). Diocletian thus got himself a co-emperor, and both of them had each a co-caesar. However, Diocletian was still the formal master; Maximian was not his equal. The real split was done in 395 (Theodosius I was the last "common" emperor) and things were already going sour at that point. Honorius evacuated Britain only 15 years later, the same year that Alaric sacked Rome; Adrianople was already in the past. The East and West empires did not have much time to be allies or enemies. We may note, though, that the split occurred on a linguistic/cultural boundary between the Latin and Greek worlds; the same split was much later reenacted in 1054, when Catholic and Orthodox churches went separate. This is a profound division which still has some relevance in modern geopolitics (e.g. remnants of that division were still at work in the Croatia-Serbia war twenty years ago). In any case, the Eastern half was richer, with a much bigger population, and a lot more trade with the rest of Asia. Notably, when Diocletian instituted the Tetrarchy, he chose the Eastern half as his specific dominion; similarly, Constantine ruled from Constantinople, not Rome. The Western empire was mostly rich in area, which would make in particular future France agriculturally wealthy and a demographic giant throughout Middle Ages, but this was for later times. In the 5th century, most of that area was still covered with forests. 

Howard Roark explains why the Parthenon is not great architecture and in passing explains that the whole of architectural history has been nothing but a series of copycatting: 

This is a huge subject so I'll restrict myself to one eloquent quote by from Robert Walpole: (taken from here): 

So, it seems that wikipedia's current characterization of him is not correct. It is ostensibly based on the book by Olusoga & Erichsen which I don't have access to so I can't check wiki's source myself. 

Technically, the gulag might have been abolished but the current Russian penitentiary system, the FSIN, retains the same spirit and the same sort attitude to inmates. They no longer intentionally try to kill the inmates off by hard labour, untreated illness, and frostbite, that much is true. They still don't give a damn, though, if that's what happens. More to the point, while the gulag might have been uneconomical in the proper sense, it enabled Stalin to accomplish a number of megalomaniac projects (e.g. the BAM). So as far as Stalin was concerned, he was getting things done, no matter what the cost. Likewise, the decision to close the gulag and to abolish the most atrocious practices was based on the general softening of the regime after Stalin's death, not on an economic calculation. 

Gospels are a source, like any other. If we were to exclude sources simply because they were written down four decades after the facts, then most of History would disappear. For instance, most of what we know on Genghis Kahn is from The Secret History of the Mongols, a document which was written several decades after his death. Fact is that known sources on Jesus, written by people who saw him or at least people who could talk with eye witnesses, are from early Christians, because only them really thought that keeping track of the teachings and adventures of Jesus was important. Gospels, Apostles' Acts... are religious in intent, not historical, which means that they must be processed through appropriate tools in order to be usable for serious History. But that's not impossible. It just requires good methodology. Early non-Christian sources on Jesus include a sentence from Flavius Josephus (which was unfortunately "interpolated", i.e. greatly modified, in ulterior copies), and some passages from Suetonius. These sources concur to show that back in year 49 AD, proto-Christians were already active in Rome. This recent biography of Jesus is good reading, well researched and done with all historical seriousness in the argumentation and usage of sources (I don't know if there is an English translation). One notable point of that book is that it uses the relics (specifically, the Shroud of Turin, the Sudarium of Oviedo and the Tunic of Argenteuil -- these three are the only ones that the author find "serious enough") to work out the details of the last hours of Jesus (and boy it sure wasn't pleasurable to be flogged and crucified); Petitfils' stance is that these artefacts have a strongly documented history with few "black areas" and any historian would consider them completely authentic sources if they were for any other figure than Jesus. Of course, History can tell nothing about resurrection, post-mortem wandering and teaching, or changing water into wine. These concern Theology, not History. An historical biography of Jesus necessarily ends on the cross. 

I've seen a claim that Alexander Nevsky's helmet has Arabic writing on it, saying something like "With Allah's help" and "Speedy victory". The claim sounds about right, giving Alexander's close working relationship with the Golden Horde, but it'd be nice to have a proper confirmation for it. 

This is, as I said, highly conjectural and I can see some holes in the asrgument. But it does make sense. 

I, for one, am not quite convinced. Ienaga's evidence is mostly of two kinds: reports by the Western journalists Snow, Smedley and Stein and a number of scattered comments which he collected from memoirs by Japanese officers and civilians. Taken all together these data may seem convincing but then one must recall that all three Westerners were known as Communist sympathizers who lived and worked among the Communists. Though they were honest and competent journalists, their perspective was very slanted and their sources were ultimately Communist, and they had little access to Nationalist sources to rectify their bias. Thus, I think that their data has to be taken with a lot of caution. The quotes from Japanese sources are rather few and episodic (about 5) and when considered on their own and not buttressed by the previously discussed data they do not amount to much. For example: after the war was over, the Communists treated some Japanese residents in Manchuria well, unlike the Russians and the local population. Presumably true, but not very relevant. Etc. In fact, Ienaga does inadvertently show at one point that his analysis is superficial when he writes: 

Latitude To measure latitude, you must measure the elevation of some celestial body. Basically, you will use the the Sun, or stars (trajectory of planets and the Moon is too complex to serve much here). If you use the Sun, then you are using a projected shadow (you don't look at the Sun directly). You have some big pole, that you try to erect as vertical as possible; and you measure the length of the shadow at noon on the equinox. You will need to do some year-long measures to work out when the equinox actually is. The crucial point is that the Sun is not a point in the sky; it has an apparent diameter of about 30' (half a degree). This is the reason why, when you look at the shadow of some building, projected on the floor, the shadow edge is blurry: this transition zone between shadow and non-shadow corresponds to the floor spots from which the Sun is partially visible, and partially hidden by the building. The bottom-line is that a Sun-based measure of latitude tends to be imprecise: accuracy is within half a degree, but no better. (With a sextant you can have a much better accuracy, but that's because that apparatus includes filters allowing the operator to actually look at the Sun, and target the disc edge, instead of "the Sun in general" as in a shadow-based measure.) With stars you can do potentially better, because they are points (at least to the naked eye) and you can stare at them directly without going blind. If you use stars, then you must follow several for a night, noting their azimuth and elevation throughout the night: this is sufficient to recompute their apparent trajectory, and then work out the latitude. The accuracy of the human eye is, at best, 1' (1/60th of a degree). However, it is hard to achieve in practice. Notably, even if you can see a 1' angle deviation, the measure will depend on the accuracy with which you know the geometric characteristics of the device you are using (including the measure of "vertical" and "horizontal"). Also, prior to Gauss and Legendre in the early 19th century, astronomers had no systematic method to deal with measure errors and smooth them out with averages and statistics. As a data point, Tycho Brahe, in the late 16th century, achieved measures with about 2' accuracy on average. These measures would translate, indeed, into a computation of latitude with the same accuracy. It must be noted that Brahe had very good eyesight, was exceptionally stubborn, and benefited from the precision offered by late Renaissance instruments when it came to measuring the length of, say, a ruler (according to David S. Landes, we have to thank clockwork technology for the availability of such tools in the Renaissance). As another data point, the Great Pyramid of Giza (built circa 2560 BC) is aligned on the cardinal point within 4'. From all these informations, we may conclude that astronomers from around 1 AD could achieve a measure of latitude with an accuracy of about 4' or so, but at considerable expense. Hipparchus has apparently done so in some occasions, but he had dedicated his life to such matters. Longitude Longitude is much harder: it can be measured by the difference between the local time and a reference time. If the Sun appears to reach noon while your watch says 2 o'clock (while it matched the Sun in your home town), then you know that you went 30 degrees to the West. This is about the only direct way to measure longitude: you need to bring a clock with you, and you will get as much accuracy as your clock provides, with 1 degree of longitude for every 4 minutes of time. Since clocks in antiquity were awfully inaccurate, this was not workable at that time. Indeed, longitude is measured by the difference in time between a sundial (which measures local time) and a clock (set to the reference time). When the clock is less accurate than a sundial, it is quite hard to reach any conclusion at all. Some indirect measures can be done in rare occasions but need astronomical devices that were not available at that time (e.g. telescopes to observe the transit of Venus when it passes between the Sun and the Earth). All longitude estimates in antiquity use the indirect method by which the longitude is inferred from the actual land distance, obtained through some other mean (mostly triangulation with notable geographical features such as hills and buildings). This works well with short distances (e.g. between Athens and Corinth), much less for long distances, and very badly when a sea is involved. Contrary to latitude, astronomers in antiquity could not get a notion of absolute longitude, only relative for locations which are close enough to each other. 

Returning to watches, I found a Russian blog post which deals extensively with Soviet watches (for example, during 1930-1935 there was just one factory (bought wholesale from a bankrupt US enterprise) in the whole SU, making 50,000 units per year, distributed to cadres - everybody else just had to make do somehow) and with trophies. It points out that trophy watches were not always appropriated by the soldiers acting on their own. Often, the commanders would hand out watches acts for exceptional bravery and these were, the story goes, often prized more than medals. The blog also claims that a Selza warehouse was taken by the Soviet troops in Berlin with 17,000 watches. Perhaps the watches in the picture were from there. (I was not able to find independent corroboration for the Selza claim). 

If I understand correctly, Thucydides actually called his book just History. If that is correct, then at what point did it become known as History of the Peloponnesian War? EDIT: Here is how he begins: 

The Holy Roman Empire, as an "empire", did not have a territory of its own. It must be understood in the context of feudalism: a number of princes/kings/bishops/whatever were tied, through sworn allegiance, to the elected Emperor. In a way, we can say that the Empire extended exactly as far as these constituent elements extended. On the other hand, the Emperor did not "own" these lands. In the vassal-suzerain relationship, the vassal owes support and a solid does of obedience, but is still the rightful owner of his lands (and in the feudal world, land ownership is merged with the judicial power). The Emperor could own some territories, not because he was Emperor, but through personal inheritance. The imperial crown did not come with a specific dedicated domain. This matters a lot from a strategic point of view: in Medieval times, the size of the army you could muster depended on your resources, i.e. the lands that you owned. The Emperor could, as the ultimate suzerain for all Empire territories, requests his vassals to provide for troops (that's what Frederick I did for the ill-fated Third Crusade), but in order to maintain order within the Empire (i.e. to keep his own vassals under his control), the Emperor had to rely on his own resources. So, in practice, the Holy Roman Empire had not so much a territory than an influence zone (thus with a "border" that is necessarily fuzzy), and the Emperor's regime was chronically weak. Some principalities that were formally part of the Empire were paying heed to what the Emperor had to say only on a very occasional basis. To a large extent, the Empire was operating in ways very similar to the contemporary Caliphate, with the Caliph being recognized as the formal commander of all Muslims, but with an actual power heavily dependent on his personal force of will and political guile.
