"Get out as fast as possible" doesn't make sense considering you are "hours or days" from a trailhead. If the allergic reaction is going to kill you, like swelling up your throat to the point you can't breath, it's going to happen within about 20 minutes. If you have someone in your party with such alergies, it is imperative you bring medications to deal with it. Certainly you need some antihistamine. That's a good idea to have in your kit anyway. Someone with known severe alergies to things in the woods should also bring epi-pens and show others where they are and how to use them. The epi mitigates the immediate symptoms in the short term. That allows you to give them the antihistamine that hopefully kicks in before the epi wears off. 

This was just built last year. It has a packed stone dust surface suitable for wheel chairs and strollers. It is only about Â¼ mile long, but is completely in the woods, with a beautiful view over a old oxbow of the Nashua River at its end: 

Your legs aren't as sensitive to temperture extremes. Right now it's winter here and I'm walking around outside with a regular shirt, a wool sweater, and a wind breaker on my torso. Inside I take off the windbreaker an sweater. However, inside or outside, I'm wearing the same single-layer pants and it's not a problem. My legs don't feel hot inside or cold outside. If I had that same single layer on my torso, I'd be pretty cold outside. 

The tent. Whatever you are tying the hammock to is obviously sticking up a bit. Let's assume trees. Things that stick up are more likely to be hit by lightning. Since the hammock needs to be tied to two things that stick up, one would be hit by the lightning and the other not. The hammock is now a conduction path for some of the lightning to connect to ground via the tree that didn't get hit directly. You don't want to be in that hammock. You may feel you are more immune to ground current by being up off the ground, but not necessarily so. If the ground current from a nearby lightning strike runs parallel to the line between the two trees, then the two hammock supports could be at substantially different voltages. That voltage would be applied to the hammock. Again, that's not good for you in the hammock. The main danger in the tent is from ground currents. Since you have the option of using a hammock, there are taller things than the tent around. That's good for avoiding a direct hit. However, the current from a nearby hit can still be substantial thru the ground the tent is sitting on. A "tent" implies some sort of floor, presumably made from a insulating material. You would also usually have something dry and insulating on that floor, like a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag. Between the tent floor, pad, and sleeping bag, you have at least some protection from the voltages caused by ground currents. So while neither a hammock nor a tent is safe in the lightning storm, the tent is the better option for minimizing the probability of getting hurt by lighting. 

You've already done the AT, so know what the terrain of the Berkshires, Green Mountains, and White Mountains is like. Obviously that gets a lot more difficult with 2-6 feet of snow on the ground. With the right gear, it is of course doable, but at too high a hassle level for most people. The Long Trail is the first that came to my mind from your description. Don't expect accommodations anywhere along the trail, like there are in places along the AT in summer. You'll be pretty much alone, except where the trail passes near ski resorts. You'll have more options where to camp than in summer, but much less options for anything other than finding and making your own campsite. For a tamer and less wild experience, you can try some of the smaller lesser-known trails. I'm from north-central MA, so the ones I'm most familiar with are the M+M and Midstate Trails. Permission to camp may be a issue. These kind of trails cross a lot of private lands with public access rights negotiated. Those rights often do not include camping. If you look at any of these secondary trails, you probably want to secure permission for camping spots in advance. Then of course there are lots of options in the White Mountains. Some of the huts are still open in winter, usually with just a single caretaker. You won't get a meal and other accommodations like you can in summer, but you can sleep indoors. Check ahead. In this case, contact the AMC at the Pinkham Notch visitor center. There are lots of beautiful and wild trails in the White Mountains that are not part of the AT. Just get a map and look around. As one of many possible examples, you can park at Lincoln Woods, then take the Wilderness Trail to Bondcliff (my favorite spot in all the White Mountains), Bond, Guyot, the Twins, etc. Or stay in the valleys more easterly. There are many many options. Another totally different possibility is to do a few day hikes on the many local trails that are all throughout the region. These are harder to find, since there is no larger organization that lists them. For example, my town (Groton, MA) has over 110 miles of trails on over 10 square miles of land open to the public. We have more miles of trails than we do paved roads, but anyone more than a few towns away probably has no idea of that. You'll never be that far from a road or a house, but you will discover some amazingly pretty places. Overnight camping is generally not allowed without advance permission, but these kinds of trails are best done as day adventures anyway. Permission can also be arranged, but that's probably more trouble than it's worth. 

It's not as lush green as Dalveen Pass, but if it was it would have to be warmer and there would be trees there. However, the vast open expanse is certainly there, even more so than Scotland seeing as ANWR is the size of all of Scotland, and that's just one part of the North Slope. If you're willing to give up on some of the lushness, then there are more options. Again, in North America lack of trees requires either that it be too dry or too cold for trees. For example, here is the Laramie Valley in northern Colorado: 

Since you want more open rocky areas at lower elevation than above treeline in the middle latitudes of the country, you have two choices. As gerrit so aptly pointed out, one choice is to go north. The treeline gets lower as you go north. The second option is to find dryer areas. Fortunately for you, these are abundant in the US southwest. There are large dry areas in southern CA, pretty much all of NV, much of AZ and UT, and parts of NM, CO, and TX. Not only is much of this public land with lax rules and cross-country hiking quite possible, but few people are out there. It's always surprised me how few people I run into less than one hour drive from large cities like Phoenix. Here is looking east down into the Bloody Basin not far north of Phoenix: 

The total number of incidents, even over a defined period of time, is meaningless by itself. There is no absolute scale for danger. What we really want to know is how dangerous one thing is relative to another, with the second being something familiar that we have some intuitive sense about. Let's say you had absolutely accurate statistics that there were 100 crimes on the Red Trail. So what? Is that high, low, normal? You can't tell from this alone whether you should consider it dangerous to take the Red Trail. The Blue Trail had only 50 crimes. But does that make it safer? Is the same time period being compared? How many people went on each trail? How long did they stay on each trail? What was the nature of the crimes? If 10 of the crimes on the Blue Trail where stabbings, but 97 out of 100 on the Red Trail were theft of unattended items, does that change your mind which trail you'd rather take? Even if you knew all these things, that still doesn't put either trail in perspective so that you can relate its safety with ordinary circumstances. In roughly April of 2017, there were 61 shootings in New York City. Does that mean you're safer on the Red Trail than walking the streets of NYC? Maybe, but you need a lot more info to draw any conclusions. How many of these shootings were on the street of people walking around? You plan on doing only day hikes on the Red Trail. How many of the 100 crimes were during the day? How many of the NYC shootings were during the day? It's really hard to get a apples to apples comparison. Also beware of anecdotal evidence. People tend to remember and report unusual incidents more than the ordinary. Your cousin's friend's sister tells of this creepy-looking guy following her on the Red Trail. However, there were probably far more creepy-looking guys going the same way as her last time she walked around NYC. She doesn't tell stories of those since people going the same way walking behind you in NYC is a expected occurrence. In neither of these cases anything bad actually happened. So not only is there strong reporting bias, it's not clear there is anything to report. The one creepy-looking guy on the Red Trail might have just been there by random chance with no ill intent. However, two of the many people that happened to be walking behind her in NYC might have been thinking how to maneuver themselves to snatch her purse, but didn't get a chance to pull it off. Basically, without a lot of detailed information, most of these statistics mean very little. And, those details are either just not available, or would be a huge amount of work to gather. If you like hiking, go hiking. Take the usual basic precautions, but don't obsess about them to the point it detracts from your hiking unless you have specific actionable information. Realize that specific actionable information is very rare.
