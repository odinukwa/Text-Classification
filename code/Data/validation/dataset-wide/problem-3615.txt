No one can say how much you can train before you become overtrained. Firstly, there are too many factors involved, such as nutrition, weather conditions, your cardiovascular fitness, your fat percentage, your strength and explosiveness, the presence of any diseases (in particular autoimmune or inflammatory). Even if science knew how all those factors affected training capacity, and how much, there is still the individual factor. Your personal biochemical profile; level of cortisol and how quickly it rises, testosterone and growth hormone, enzymes and proteins at the cellular level. This is the big problem with the overtraining syndrome; no one can really know beforehand how much he/she can train. It is only when you start experiencing symptoms of overtraining that you can begin to titer your training down to maximal, but safe, levels. One simple thing thing that you can do is to measure your morning heart rate. It's simple, and everyone has the equipment for it. Keep track of your morning pulse every day, and if it starts going up about 10 beats on average for 3-4 days, then it's time to rest or decrease training intensity (I speak from my own experience. For you the numbers may be different, however the principle is the same). I had overtraining syndrome a couple of years ago, and of all the symptoms, the most objective one, that I could gauge, was my morning heart rate which was around 80 instead of the previous 40-45. Since then I have kept track of my HR every day. So to sum up: you can't know how much you can train before becoming overtrained. What you can do however is to keep track of your fitness and recovery levels. This is most easily and objectively done by measuring changes in the morning heart rate. 

No exercises will automatically improve imbalances. It is important to work on the specific imbalance one might have. For instance, if someone is kyphotic they should certainly put more of an emphasis on rowing type movements to improve the strength of the back muscles. Doing the same amount of pushing and pulling work will not yield any change in the issue. Form also plays a huge role in the fixing of muscle imbalances. Two examples where this point can really be seen would be the row and squat. If a person performs a row while in flexion, they will not be helping their body get back to extension as it should be. As for the squat, not hitting parallel would not help the imbalance between the quads and hamstrings. Since only when the lifter is squatting down to parallel do the hamstrings really come in to play. 

I understand that in order to get results out of a workout one must invoke progress overload into the workout. One way of doing this is to have less rest time, and another way is to increase the amount of weight being lifted. My question is though, if say i do 2 sets of bicep curls with 25 lbs dumbbells for seven reps is there any benefit of doing another set or is it simply better to go up in weight or cut my rest time? Some things i feel i should point out to help you answer. Firstly my barometer to know when its time to go up in weight is when i can do 7 reps on my last set (i know some of you may do more reps per set before increasing weight, but i am currently trying to get stronger hence the low rep range). Another thing i should point out is that i do not only do 2 sets of bicep curls i also do 2 sets of hammer curls for a total of 4 sets. With that in mind is there any benefit to adding another set? 

The acute effect of exercising (any type of exercise) is that the muscles become engorced with blood. This serves to increase oxygenation, remove metabolites, deliver nutrients and anabolic hormones. A muscle that is engorged is, obviously, larger and tighter than one that is not. This is the reason behind your "toned" muscles". Another thing that happens during muscle contractions is that the neural imput it recieves increases. This has the effect of an increased post-exercise tonus; tonus is when a proportion of the muscle is contraccting, even in the absense of force production. This is another reason why your muscles feel harder after exercising, but this effect also disappears after a couple of days (even faster with warm showers and massages). Basically, there is no change in the structure of your muscles the way you train. You exercise, and then wait for the effects to completely disappear before training again. In order to progress, you must stress your body. I would suggest you read up on "supercompensation". This is called the one-factor model of training and is kind of outdated, but still very similar to the more accepted two-factor model of training. However, unless you plan on becoming a professional, there is a minimal difference as far as results go. On another note, I see that there are a couple comments about toning for the previous answer to this question. "Toning is a myth" - Yes, in the sense that people portray it. Toning will not increase your fitness markedly, nor will it get your muscles stronger or harder. What people refer to when talking about toning is when slow twitch muscle fibers undergo sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. So, in one way, performing low weight/high rep exercise can increase muscle cross section area. It will not however increase strength. Also, the hypertrophic potential of slow twitch muscle fibers is much lower than that of fast twitch fibers. Aiming to get "toned", in the sense that people do, is a waste of time. Classical body building methods, medium weight/medium reps, are more efficient. 

I just got a new client who informed that both of his rotater cuffs are torn. From My understanding, it seems as though I should avoid all upper body exercises so that I don't injure them further. I also know that external rotations are used for prehab to strengthen the shoulders before they get hurt, but can this exercise be used once the damage has been done? Can I help this client gain some strength in his shoulders using external rotaions? 

Actually we have some fairly massive muscles such as our abs, traps, and calves which are made up mostly of slow twitch fibers. Now with that established i think i can answer your question. You asked if big muscles are always piles of fast twitch fibers. Well most muscles are, but like i mentioned those 3 muscle groups are not. Now the way that we train these muscles is by doing a lot more reps. For instance the abs and calves are muscles which are usually trained to failure, the reason being is that in order to make them bigger or stronger we must go after the slow twitch fibers which require more reps. The traps too are muscles which require more reps, meaning if say somebody usually does only 1 to 5 reps per set, like in a case where he is training for strength, he will still do somewhere close to 15 reps for his traps. So what im saying is, yes we do workout those muscles differently, we do more reps. By doing this we will not lose muscle as you pointed out in your question because that only happens if your endurance training, but if the muscles is made up mostly of slow twitch fibers then doing more reps is not endurance training . 

Cycling has been shown to shorten the rectus femoris. This happens because its range of motion is smaller than in for example running. The same thing happens to any muscle that is used across a shorter range of motion, so I presume that the exact same thing happens to the hamstring. There is another factor that plays a role there as well. The hamstring has two functions (and thus two distinct parts, at least the biceps femoris). One part of the biceps femoris only bends the knee, the other part both bends the knee and extends the hip. When cycling, the knee-bending part works at shorter ranges, while the hip-extending part is stretched because we reach forward for the handles. This can eventually lead to impalances, as one part of the muscle becomes tighter than the other. 

There is one thing that might not be as serious as rhabdomyolysis or kidney damage, but it is far more frequent. It is the fact that people use NSAIDs as pain killers during training. I am a professional athlete, and to my experience more than 90% of athletes have this habit of taking NSAIDs for DOMS and pain to get through training. What is the function of pain? To alert the person that something is either inflammed or damaged. By covering that pain during training you put additional strain on an already damaged structure. This puts you at risk of not only futher injuring yourself, but also of overuse through faulty movements or other types of strain that pain would have signaled. Using NSAIDs during competitions, to rid the pain and achieve maximal performance, is fine. But to use them for that purpose continually can only do harm. Furthermore, NSAIDs are a frequent causative agent of peptic ulcers. Long-term use puts you at direct risk of this. To further aggrevate the problem is the fact that the sympathetic nervous system gets activated during training, which decreases mucus (protective mechanism for the gastric acid) production in the stomach.
