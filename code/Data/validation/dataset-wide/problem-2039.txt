Choose your battles wisely. Changing the policy on your own and only for your team will provoke feelings of resentment ("Why are we the only ones that have to deal with this?"). The more so if the company values flexibility and the employees share this value. Note that normally the policy is there for a reason. You are not the only one that might face this problem, and obviously they decided that the upsides outweigh the downsides. And what could you win? The problematic situation has never arisen up to now, and it might never arise in the future. Also, only very limited damage would be done, since a sudden absence due to illness is something that always has to be considered, and someone being not there for a few days should never be a show-stopper (or the planning is questionable). Also, if you know in advance that day X will be a critical day, you can emphasize this in front of your team. This will greatly reduce the chance of someone taking that day off and forgetting to tell you (I assume no deliberate troublemaking here, only accidental slip). Bearing that in mind, I simply would take the risk. And if the situation should really occur that someone is on vacation and would have been needed on-site, you can afterwards still implement a new rule for the team, referring to the actual events. The acceptance in this case would be much higher than for a rule that relies on theoretical events. Of course you can just implement the rule, it is not really a big thing. It is just that the battle is not worth it, and you might need your (political) credit differently later on. 

I want to record our meetings, especially discussions about projects, because I often miss some important details they tell me and my writing cannot catch-up. However, I don't feel like I need to tell them as they may feel it's an invasion of privacy. I have no malicious intent whatsoever, just really so that I can review the project details / comments and not miss out any. 

I'm working overseas and almost all of my colleagues speak another language (their native language). They talk to me in English regarding work-related stuff and everyone speaks English during meetings. So this is fine. However, during lunch time or other personal conversations in the office, everyone almost speaks their native language and I feel excluded. Like, whenever we all go out for lunch, I would sit with them quietly while they all talk about something I don't understand. Sometimes, they would change into English and that's only the time I can join in the conversation but after a while, they'll speak in their native language and I'll feel excluded again. (Personally, if I am talking to someone who speaks my native language and someone joins in who doesn't speak it, I would automatically switch to English. I would feel very uncomfortable with someone sitting there not knowing what we are talking about.) I'm not used to this set-up because in my previous work (in this same country), all my colleagues would speak English once they know that someone in the table cannot speak their native language. That way, I was able to make good friends in the office (who are friends outside the office too). Most of my waking hours in a week are spent in the office and it's very frustrating to have no friends in the office where I spend 8 hours a day, 5x a week due to the language barrier. And even more frustrating because they all speak fluent English, just that it's not their preferred mode of speaking. Which I understand because it's not their native language. My question is how do I deal with such an environment? Should I just consider the people in the office as just colleagues, start distancing myself (like maybe lunch on my own?), and give up on any hope of making personal friends there? On one hand, I won't have friends in the office and I'm just there purely for work but on the other hand, my life would be easier if I remove any expectations of making friends. If I distance myself, then I won't feel intentionally excluded (although they may not intend it, that's how I feel). It's just a bullet I have to bite by working in a foreign country. 

Did you make sure that expert knowledge in A is really necessary? It might be that they would like to get an expert, tried to find one for a while, and gradually reduced the requirements (internally - they will still ask for an expert officially) until even someone with at least a bit of experience is acceptable for the job. Sometimes you just don't find what you want, so you have to take what you can get. Just make sure that they know that your expertise in A is limited. If they still accept, fine. 

While you can't (and shouldn't) do much to stop this - after all, the burden of prove would be upon you, as well as the problem to deal with an angry manager afterwards - it is advisable to be very careful concerning this guy. After all, if he is ready to blatantly lie on an online profile, he may also be able to blatantly lie about his (and thus, your) achievements in the company. For me, this would be a severe warning signal, and I would recommend to try changing the team, maybe even the job. Expect such sort of people to take advantage of you whenever they are able to. And him being friends with the VP, you will always be in an inferior position should any sort of conflict arise. 

And even if it works out, you might be in a situation where this manager sees you as owing her for getting the job and urging you to do other questionable/unprofessional things later on in return for the favor. Thus, my clear advice is: Decline the offer politely. Not only for reasons of professionality, but also in your own best interest. 

As a background, I am currently working as a foreigner where in 90% of my colleagues speak the local language and while the other 10% speak another language. Cut the story short, I'm the only one in the office that is of my nationality. We recently shifted office and my seating arrangement changed. I am currently sitting in the middle of a group of all-locals and they'd often speak their language unless they're specifically speaking to me (where in they'd switch to English). For one, I am not complaining that they should speak in English. It's their country and they can speak their local language. However, I feel very distracted and feel unintentionally left out when they banter which I didn't feel when I was seated further. It makes me very unhappy in an otherwise friendly and nice environment. Is it reasonable for me to ask one of my colleagues, who was actually was previously in the same seating position I currently am to swap seats? I say same position because the arrangement of the group didn't change even if we shifted office. Only the two of us swapped. His seat is on the edge and I'd feel more comfortable to be a little bit further from the rest (which was where my old seat was). I don't know how to say it to him without offending anyone. Like, what if my current seat mate thinks I don't like him (which isn't true) because I wanted to change seat. And without coming off as fussy. But it really affects my concentration. 

If you broke your arm, you can't carry heavy loads. If you broke your leg, you can't run quickly. Trying to do so will cause more harm than good. And it's not different for anxiety and depression disorders. This is an illness that needs a cure as well as a broken arm or leg. So tell your business partner about your medical condition. Get a doctor to examine this and give you an attestation of your condition (and of course also to help you with your ailment). Since you already tried to commit suicide, this is an emergency even if you feel you can currently avoid another suicide attempt. What would you have done if you had a severe car accident and had to stay in hospital for several weeks? Such things happen. Let your business partner be angry, that happens too. It is of no use to anybody if you end up dead from a successful suicide attempt. And even if you could avoid this and force yourself to work, the results will be of low quality. You may have a bad conscience now, but in hindsight, you will be glad that you took the break. 

That would be a stupid move by your manager since he could just ask you directly to take up these other responsibilities. There are many reasons why the current situation is as it is. Maybe the manager thinks that your workload is higher than it actually is. Maybe they want four eyes instead of two for the job. Maybe there currently is just not enough work to do for you and your co-worker. Who knows? But it is not your job to do management decisions. More important are the following questions: 

Currently, we have built products that are not yet out in the public. However, they make up quite a huge and important chunk of my portfolio.. to demonstrate what I've done for the project. I am a UX specialist and I need a lot of visuals to showcase what I've done. And I am not even sure if I can even mention about these unreleased products. How do I handle this? 

Is it alright to take 1-2 days leave if you are still on probation? I would almost be 3 months in the company during this period but this trip I'm planning is 2 weeks earlier than the end of my probation period. And I cannot move the date. How do I negotiate with our HR about this? I'm willing to be unpaid during this 1-2 days leave. 

I went for an interview and the employer asked for my current salary to which I replied X amount. However, I included in the amount the yearly bonus that we receive which essentially bumps up my monthly salary by a little bit (whether this is ethical or not is another discussion). However, to continue with the process of hiring, they asked for my payslip which doesn't reflect the bonus that I've received. This is also the first time I've been asked of my payslip during the hiring process. How do I answer to them if they ask me why my payslip amount is a little less than what I've mentioned?
