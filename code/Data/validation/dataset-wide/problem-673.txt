I feel like there are almost as many bike multi-tools out there as there are bikers. In a single trip to REI, I found nine different bike tools each ranging from only four to over thirty individual tools! But how many of these tools do I actually need? I feel like some of the tools included in these multi-tools aren't really ever going to be necessary in the middle of a ride, but are actually better suited for at-home repair. So, what tools do you actually need to carry with you, that you might actually need while out riding, and what tools are you can safely leave at home? 

Probably the easiest way to fix your problem is to reduce the amount of power the GPS on your phone is using. By default, most GPS tracking programs eat up an enormous amount of battery because they default to maximum-accuracy settings. However, if you're going on long enough bike rides that you are worrying about battery life, you can probably afford to turn down these settings. The way to do this is different with each of the different tracking apps, so I can't tell you exactly how to fix this, but if you dig around in the settings for a while you should find something. I know that the two apps I've used (Runtastic and My Tracks) have both allowed me to do this. 

The Scott-Peterson SE brakes used standard canti bosses. You're probably safe to replace them with standard cantis or V-brakes (what type of levers are you using?). 

This is an odd question. The sentiment that the only security here is physical security is correct. Think about the following: 

The recessed mount isn't a new thing. It's been standard on road bikes since the mid-1980's. Either way, Harris Cyclery has several nutted models available for the situation you describe. You're relegated to brands like Tektro, as the major component manufacturers cater to recessed mountings. 

Given all of this, use common sense. You can just keep the bike secured or limit access to the bike's junction box (think low-tech, like duct-tape or hot-glue). Or you can inspect settings and check firmware revisions. In the end, the Di2 junction box is the brain of the system. Someone with ill-intent (and physical access) could just replace the entire module in 30 seconds or so. You're seeking a technological solution to a people problem. 

I'd say get any cheap thumb shifter. Much easier to operate than grip+twist shifter. Click down is very easy. Shift up requires a firm push with the thumb. My daughter when learning to shift gears had a big problem. She's a tough cookie but more delicate hands than average and the twist shifts were just too stiff. You don't notice this with big strong adult hands. We replaced her twist shift with cheap thumb shift and it made a huge difference. Also make sure gear cable is well oiled and moves smoothly and derailleurs cleaned and oiled for smooth operation. 

I'm afraid I think the other answers on here don't have it right. It's unlikely to be your rear cassette which is the problem. Your problem is most likely to be with your chain and rear derailleur. Happily not expensive just can be a bit tricky to fix. Three things to check: 

In my experience, that sound is caused, not by the hub, but because the tire is rubbing against the brake pads. This can happen if the tire is slightly out of alignment or isn't properly trued, or if the brakes got accidentally bumped while riding (depending on your type of brakes). Try spinning your tire and watching it move between the brake pads, and you should see some wobble to it. If this is the case, try removing the wheel and putting it back on (spin it again before tightening it in, and adjust it accordingly). If that doesn't do enough, try adjusting the brake pads (a different procedure depending on what type of brakes you have, so I can't really elaborate). If it's still giving you trouble, then the wheel is misshapen, and needs to be re-trued, which is probably best done by a bike shop, but isn't too hard to figure out on your own. 

It's over politically-correct to say "you cannot do it" or "you have to ask permission". I find that it's not really that possible to chat / ask permission. I don't think it is rude. Most cyclists do not mind. You might exchange a word if you stop at traffic lights. Depending on relative speed and road situation common sense (ahum sometimes not that common maybe but not all that uncommon either!) is a good guide. There's a long steady uphill section on my commute home mostly with mixed on-road and shared foot/cycle path. I often find I'm riding at the same pace as other cyclists so drafting happens somewhat naturally. I don't find that taking turns happens at all much. On SAFETY(some of the common sense): you have to be HYPER-aware of what is coming up in front as well as road situation all around/behind (as usual!). You cannot draft right on wheel expecting signals as in road racing. It is an informal arrangement! When drafting like this I try to be of safety BENEFIT to the cyclist in front. You can back off frequently and give space as the cyclist in front encounters hazards, move to the side to look in front and behind, signal to front and behind and look after both yourself and others. I generally have flashing lights on and I have a bell :-) and I find riding as a pair like this is better for safety against car traffic. Also, I don't know is this just Dublin, Ireland, but many cyclists don't have(illegal here) or use bells. I find the tinkle of a bell + voice from well back mostly gives enough warning to pedestrians/dog walkers/other hazards(:-)). Warning enough that multiple cyclists can pass in a friendly way as opposed to all coming to a grumpy slow halt or blazing past close by in a dangerous manner. I find I might be the only one sometimes in group of 4/5 that will offer a tinkle! 

You can pick up any low-cost standard-reach rear brake. In a pinch, some of the models from Nashbar work. You can zip-tie or run cable clips to route your brake cable. Be sure to acquire a long length of cable housing. 

The easiest solution is to use the right tool to make sure the star nut is aligned and set to the right depth in the steerer tube. I'd really recommend taking this to a shop and asking to borrow the proper tool. I own one, even though it only gets used once or twice per year. I've tended to go more towards compression plugs instead of the old star-fangled nut. If you're looking for an alternative to using the proper tool, you can thread a bolt in the nut and tap carefully with a hammer, or perhaps use a dowel or socket of the appropriate diameter instad of a bolt. 

There are a number of changes you can make that can help, and I've found that it is a matter of personal preference what solution you ultimately choose. Creams and lubricants are very effective at preventing this rash, but they can be messy. Something as simple as Vaseline will work, though there are a number of other options out there. It could be possible that you need to trade out your old seat, but this solution can tend to be hit-or-miss. If the seat is the problem, then replacing it will of course work, but there could be any number of potential issues that are causing it. It might be better to look into some more versatile solutions instead of spending money on a new seat only to find that it wasn't your problem in the first place. Another option you can look into is synthetic underwear. It can aid in the dissipation of moisture, and provide an extra layer to help reduce the friction on your leg. I personally swear by the ExOfficio briefs, and have had no problems since switching over to them. 

New chain is the right length? The new chain should have the same number of links as the old chain. Did you line up old and new chain (allowing for wear so the line-up will be asymmetrical!) and put on new chain with the same number of links? I used this recently: $URL$ OFTEN rear derailleur can get a bit twisted or bent. You were riding in the forest and chain snapped. Might you have bumped something? :-) Especially your rear derailleur is exposed to bashing off things when mountain-biking. Check does your rear derailleur cog line up correctly with your rear cogs? Applying some gentle brute force in the right place on the rear derailleur can help. This is very good: $URL$ Check something in your drive chain. I got a notch in my front derailleur which chews and snaps chain! So check front and back drive-train. Is your back wheel aligned correctly also? 

I was thinking about this today. I have a similar KMC chain and own the Park Tool Master Link pliers. Following chain removal for maintenance, the KMC master link began to cause an audible click every time it engaged the cassette. The noise grew over the course of several weeks. I'd just as well go without the link from now on. I think the utility of a master link has diminished over time as tolerances grew tighter and cassettes narrower... 

It depends. You've thrown out a few options. I'm a track cyclist, so I prefer the track bike on the rollers. However, that's mostly to work on form and comfort at high RPM's in my race position. That's the main benefit of rollers. For strength training and resistance, I used to use a mag or fluid trainer. I would do so with a road bike. The main benefit there is the ability to change gears/resistance by shifting. That would be more appropriate if you're looking to ride along with a video... Nowadays, I take a completely different ($$$) approach...
