The initial statements about fractional reserve banking are not a question. The simplified example you give does not reflect the complexity of bank lending. The article "Money Creation in the Modern Economy," by Michael McLeay, Amar Radia and Ryland Thomas of the Bank of England link to paper is one place to start to get a more realistic discussion of money creation. 

The tricky part of this question is that it does not specify that we are on a coupon date. If we are away from a coupon date, we normally assume that if we say that a bond “is trading at a discount”, we are talking about the clean price (which excludes accrued interest). On a coupon date, we can use a simplified pricing formula and derive the relationship (as seen in another answer here). The exact formula for the clean price will depend on the market convention. However, we could use the following structure for all market conventions. 

In practice, the uncertainty around rate expectations by investors prevented such extreme outcome during the period when the Federal Reserve bond yield peg was credible. (Since no one is completely sure about the expected path of short rates, investors will not dump their entire bond portfolio, or proceed to buy up all of the central bank's holdings.) However, once the commitment to keep short rates low was questioned by the Fed, the peg was abandoned before such a "run" started. 

Direct. Government demand is obviously lower, and is a component of domestic demand. Indirect. The recipients of income from government spending have less money to spend. 

Depending on your data source, the debt level will either be the face value of debt, or its market value. The usual choice is face value. The debt level is a stock. Interest payments are an expense that will show up in the deficit, which is a flow variable. If nothing else happens, then new debt = old debt + interest. More generally, (new debt) = (old debt) + (fiscal deficit) is the simplified relationship. (Note that this will be an approximation to real world data, as it is possible for some transactions to affect the debt level, but are not part of the definition of the fiscal deficit, and vice-versa.) 

No. The auction uses the highest yield, which means the lowest price (for the same coupon). That is, for bonds, price up -> yield down (and vice versa). (The only tricky bit is that the coupon is not known until the auction concludes.) For a discussion of U.S. Treasury bond structure: link to TreasuryDirect. Not all bonds are issued via an auction process (one alternative is “tapping” issues). Sweden is an example of using a multi-price auction - link to Swedish auction description. 

Interest on reserves is not that significant a factor in a low interest rate regime. If the bank did not hold reserves, it would hold Treasury bills as a liquidity buffer, and they pay about the same amount as the policy rate. I believe the reserve ratio is 10%, so the difference between paying and not paying interest on reserves is worth 15 basis points (.15%) if the policy rate is 1.5%. So the interest spread might be a bit tighter than was the case when interest was not paid on reserves. The net interest margin and fees are how banks pay expenses, and earn a profit. In order for a bank to offer banking services, it needs an interest advantage on deposits versus short-term wholesale borrowing. Otherwise, it can be replaced by a non-bank financial intermediary that grants loans and funds itself entirely in the money and bond markets. Since banks of the same size have a similar cost structure, their target interest margin is similar. I believe that the idea behind a perfect equilbrium is that there is a potentially infinite number of new entrants to compete away profits. That is obviously impossible in the banking industry; you need capital, and there is a large time commitment to getting a banking license. Furthermore, you will have large fixed costs (branch, personnel, capital) that have to be covered in order to be viable. It is not hugely surprising that customers are not too sensitive to posted rates on deposits. The availability of services and other fees may be far more significant than what they earn. Where there is competition for deposits is in the certificate of deposit (CD) market. (I believe, I am Canadian, but I believe that our GIC’s operate similarly to CD’s.) A major factor for customer stickiness (on top of what you mention in the question) is a significant number of households and firms have debts with banks. It would be awkward to have your deposits with one bank, and your mortgage with another. Since the bank sees all your cash flows, it is presumably easier to negotiate new borrowing with your existing bank. 

A recession is a temporary drop in economic activity, while resource depletion is a structural factor. One could easily imagine resource depletion causing a permanent drop in the standard of living. However, even if this occurs, there would still be a business cycle, with the economy moving between expansion and contraction (recession). Since resource depletion is a steadily increasing process, the theory that it causes recessions would suggest that recessions would be more frequent as time passes. In fact, recessions have been less frequent in recent decades. (One can examine the recession dating information for the United States from the National Bureau of Economic Research at this web page.) Unless you can specify some theory linking historical recessions to resource depletion, this question cannot really be answered. I am unaware of any such theory in the literature, so there is nothing to point to. There may have been such ideas in the Peak Oil literature, but short-term economic forecasting was probably not that literature's greatest strength. 

The Treasury auction process is described here: Treasury Direct Bidders can either enter competitive or non-competitive bids. Non-competitive bids are limited in size; the price is set by the competitive bids, which generally come from Primary Dealers (that are obliged to bid). As a simplified example of the bidding process, assume that the government announces an auction for $2 million in 30-year bonds. (Note that this example ignores bidding size limits.) There are three bids: 

“Capital” is not an asset (as that would be on the right hand side of the balance sheet) they are long maturity instruments on the right hand side of the balance sheet. Common equity is one major component. It’s the residual you get after you subtract all other items on the right hand side of the balance sheet from total assets - which is what forces the balance sheet to balance. (There are presumably some accounting details I am skipping over.) If we simplify things, it’s how much more its assets are worth than its liabilities, and so it cannot get put anywhere. All that can happen is that assets it owns (a loan to another bank) can lose value, and so the credit loss reduces equity (and hence capital). (I think perpetual preferred shares are the other major component of Tier 1 Capital. These are issued by the bank in question, and so the failure of another bank has no effect on them.) 

Central banks generally publish statistics with money supply numbers, with the various components. The St. Louis Federal Reserve has a statistical page called FRED. This is a link to the series for monetary aggregates (over 1000 series!) Since it may be difficult to browse all of those series, you could look at the H.6 Release link to latest release, which lists the components of the money supply, and their values.
