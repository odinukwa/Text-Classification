When dealing with the "causes" of events there are no facts. You are in the world of interpretation and opinion. Characterizing the American entry into the war as the sole product of a Rothschild PR campaign is as ridiculous as it is unprovable. Your statement that the revolutions were having no effect on the war seems incorrect to me. To which "sources" are you referring? One of the main pressures on the Germans to agree to the armistice was that people were rioting in the streets and it was getting worse. There were mutinies occurring left and right on both sides. If you think this does not have an effect on the calculations of military leaders, you are mistaken. 

The biggest difference between the way a non-historian and a historian do history is the type of sources they use. A historian will attempt to use primary sources, meaning sources written by actors or reporters at the time of events. For example, letters, newspapers and other contemporary accounts. A non-historian will tend to use secondary sources, meaning books and articles written by historians, possibly at a much later date. For example, let's imagine we are studying the Medici family. A historian will try to use letters and documents from 14th and 15th century Florence, all written in Latin or Italian, of course, to understand the Medici. A non-historian will use a book like "The House of Medici: Its Rise and Fall" by Christopher Hibbert to learn the history. 

In the church of Rome there was no contradiction between being both a member of the church and being titled. In fact, some entire states were ruled by priests. For example, the Archbishopric of Salzburg was an independent principality for centuries right in the middle of Europe which was ruled by an archbishop who was inevitably from some noble family. The ruler of state was called a prince-bishop. A typical example was Conrad I of Salzburg. 

2012, Port Said-Cairo match in Egypt saw over 70 people killed accompanied by massive riots and burning down of the stadium and nearby buildings. 1985 European Cup Final, Heysel Stadium, Brussels. Liverpool and Juventus fans fought a pitched battle resulting in 39 dead and over 350 injured. In 2012, a match between FC Olympiakos and FC Panathinaikos in Greece featured a large riot in which the fans set the stadium on fire and injured 9 police. At the 1974 UEFA Cup Final, Tottenham Hotspur vs Feyenoord, angry English fans rioted, doing significant damage to the stadium. In 1985, Birmingham vs. Leeds a massive riot erupted resulting in property damage. At the Turkish League championship in Istanbul in 2012 Fenerbahce fans rioted and started setting fires in the stadium and in the vicinity. One man was seriously injured. In 2013, the Czech Cup had to be postponed when the fans of opposing teams started a massive brawl and riot. The 2003 Wroc≈Çaw football riot featured an armed battle between opposing fans in which one person was killed and dozens injured. The famous Kennilworth Road riot of 1985 occurred after a match between Millwall vs. Luton match in England. 47 people were injured. In Zagreb in 1990 the match between Dinamo and Red Star turned into a violent brawl that ended in the stadium being torched. The event was considered a factor in the genesis of the Yugoslavian civil war that broke out the next year. 

They did send more aid. Hasdrubal, Hannibal's brother, came with a whole new army which miraculously made it all the Italy, but then was unfortunately wiped out at the Battle of the Metaurus. 

William Stanley did not support Warbeck. In fact, he helped put the king on the throne and strongly supported him. Henry had Stanley set up by being falsely accused by a stool pigeon named Robert Clifford who was put up to it by Henry's men. Henry disliked that Stanley was very popular with everyone, and moreover he looked forward to seizing Stanley's estates which were considerable. In short, Stanley was framed and killed for his money and to eliminate him as a possible rival to the king. The whole story can be found in "Memoirs of the rival houses of York and Lancaster" (1827) by Emma Roberts. 

The design commonly used in American cards today is derived ultimately from French decks going back to the Renaissance. The earliest common American interpretation was by an artist named John Cazenave about 1800 about whom little is known. His designs were improved and much more widely printed by Charles Bartlett circa 1830. Then, around 1850, Samuel Hart of Philadelphia started publishing a lot of cards. Below is a Hart design: 

As you pointed out, your basic premise is wrong. There is nothing "homogenous" about the Egyptians. Just for starters, centuries of Arab conquest changed that. Even in ancient times the Egyptians had different ethnic groups living in different parts of the country, and the ethnicity of the royal family and nobility was considered different altogether. In modern Egypt the Copts, a Christian people, are considered to be descendants of the ancient (Roman) Egyptians and Alexandrians, not the Arabs who are muslims. Speaking of Alexandria, it is worth noting that the Greeks ruled Egypt for many centuries and there was a huge diaspora to Egypt out of Judea in Roman times. In Medieval times the Byzantine Greeks and the Turks both occupied and ruled Egypt, creating their own sub cultures and ethnic groups. So, whoever told you that the Egyptians are "homogenous" or somehow descended from the pharoahs or whatever, has no idea what they they are talking about. 

Even though samurai, in the form of armed retainers, were abolished, the class divisions in Japanese society remained, though in a relaxed form. A much more far-reaching change was the introduction of private land ownership in 1873. Before this most Japanese were poor tenants on huge tracts of land all belonging to a single lord, each lord employing samuarai. By distributing land among yoeman and allowing private ownership it broke down this feudal structure and eliminated much of the structural power of the samurai. That being said, the samurai and noble families continued to be influential and have a privileged place in society, and this remains true even today. For example, a Japanese employment form (which is the same for EVERYONE) looks like this (as an American would fill it out): 

It is difficult to make exact estimates because reliable figures from different publishers making the same book are hard to come by, especially in the case of pirated editions, which were rampant at that time. The popularity of Uncle Tom's Cabin has been somewhat exaggerated and there were many publications that compare to it. For example, if you include magazines, Harpers was gigantic, publishing 2 million volumes every year. In 1853, over 300,000 copies of Uncle Tom's Cabin were sold, but the same year Phiney & Ivison sold over 500,000 copies of Sanders' Reading Books. Also, Dickens way outsold Uncle Tom's Cabin. Bleak House alone sold over 250,000 copies, just in its initial runs. Little Dorritt was even more popular and Great Expectations sold millions of copies. Hoyle was also very popular and probably outsold Uncle Tom's Cabin if you counted up all copies and pirated editions. Certain standard school texts like Smith's Geography which racked up 100,000 per year easily probably outsold Uncle Tom's Cabin if you counted all copies over the years. Probably the number one book of all time from the period was Great Expectations (1861) which has probably sold more than 100 million copies total over the years. 

It is very unlikely such a thing existed. The Nazi cult assigned very specific roles to men and women. Working women in the Third Reich did exist and included not only secretaries, but even some combat roles. For example, it was found that women were much better AA gunners than men, so boom, they made every single AA gunner a woman. However, by the same token, roles that were designated to men, such as secret police, were invariably men. Women did act occasionally as spies, so you might be better off making her a spy of some kind, temporarily thrust into the role of interrogator. That would be more realistic. 

After the voyages of Columbus, who sailed for Spain, the Portuguese and Spanish divided up the new world in the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494). The later pattern of colonization followed this treaty in general outline. Your question has an incorrect assumption, that the Portuguese were only traders. They had a global empire that included Brazil, islands in the Caribbean, the Azores, many places in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. 

The idea behind this question seems to be to better understand what it would have required for the Germans to have invaded England in WW2. How close were they to that objective? To conduct an invasion like this, there are two main factors: (1) tactical (can your weapons beat their weapons) and (2) logistical (can we move across enough stuff?). Your question focuses on item (2), how much stuff do we need? Unfortunately for the Germans, they never really got to step (2). Let's consider problem #1. If you solve that problem, problem #2 is actually pretty easy. With enough tactical domination you can move guys across in canoes if you have to. The real issue is the tactical problem. From a tactical point of view, the British had 3 capital ships and a bunch of destroyers, like 20 or something like that, defending the channel. To invade you would need to destroy those ships or drive them away. The British constantly patrolled the channel with Spitfire fighters looking for enemy ships and planes. Even a single battleship can absolutely annihilate any number of troop carriers, and it is much faster than a troop carrier or logistics vessel. Even a single destroyer with just four 5" inch guns could just tear apart any invasion force. It would be sickening to watch that. Imagine 20 destroyers and a couple of battleships. Unthinkable. To neutralize these ships, the Germans needed to get air control. With air control, they could use dive bombers like Stukas to destroy the ships or confine them to harbor. They failed to get this air control in the Battle of Britain. If they had succeeded in destroying all the British Spitfires and other fighters or forced them to stay grounded, then the British would have had to move their ships out (or watch them get destroyed). The inability of the Luftwaffe to do this meant an invasion was impossible. What if Air Control Had Been Achieved? Now, to get to your main questions, if air control had been achieved, what kind of land army would be needed? The British home army had something like 20 divisions and 1000 guns. By comparison the Germans used about 100 divisions just to invade Poland alone, including 9 armored divisions. If they had landed a holding force of 5 divisions with enough artillery battalions, about 50,000 men (including logistics) and 500 or so guns, that would have been enough to establish a base to import the rest of the army, which would of course have been completely decisive. Nevertheless, getting 50,000 men across the channel would have been a non-trivial exercise. You would need hundreds of landing craft plus logistics vessels to provide food, water, ammo, and fuel. These were all solvable problems, though. The problem that did not get solved was the war in the air. 

He is citing Andre Favin who wrote the book Theatre d'Honneur et de Chevalerie, an early and well-known tome on chivalry in the 16th century. Of course, what might be said at various times and places would be completely different and the ceremony could range from being perfunctory or elaborate. As a general rule, a knighting pronouncement had three parts, the admonition (warnings and advice), the blessing and the bestowal (the actual title(s) and rank conferred announced). 

It is true this particular king was very energetic and made many campaigns against the Arabs into Persia and even upper central Asia, but these campaigns were just military expeditions, not a controlled empire. The enduring Karkota Empire was much smaller and only lasted for about 200 years. The following map shows the situation in 700 AD and this situation was not fundamentally altered by the Karkotas. 

First of all, carbon dating is a highly inexact science to begin with. If you submit identical samples to different labs you will get widely differing results. Also, all labs I know of require the submission to describe where the sample came from and provide an estimated age of the sample. In fact, a lot of labs not only require you to estimate the age of the sample, they require you to justify your estimate. Obviously, this is not scientific. A scientific measurement is "blind", meaning the tester does not what the result should be ahead of time; carbon dating does not fall into this category. As far as stratigraphy is concerned, infiltrated remains, the kind of error you describe are always a concern. Usually any kind of single piece of evidence is not sufficient to date an object; an overwhelming and diversified set of evidence is necessary. For example, if a bone is found in a tomb, that is not enough to date the construction of the tomb, because the bone could have been placed in the tomb long after it was constructed. There is no way to date a stone carving based on just the stone itself, because the chemistry of the situation is too variable and too complex. For example, moisture and temperature fluctuation will have a big effect on how a stone weathers. So, one excavated stone might look brand new, and another one very ancient and degraded. Usually stone carvings are dated either on the basis of style or on the archaeological context they are found in. 

He did not say it. The bon mot was well known in France and was originated by Voltaire in Chapter 24 of his book Siecle de Louis XIV which was published in 1751. According to Voltaire's account Louis XIV said this in a speech before the parliament on April 13, 1865, which would have been 85 years previously to when Voltaire wrote it. In the actual speech Louis several times referred to "mon etat" (my State) and this was reported by the Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris which Voltaire undoubtedly had read. Apparently Voltaire then took it on himself to change what was in the report to the famous phrase which was of his own invention. 

Daniel completely perverted the original sense of the sentence to his own purpose. Hendricks was borrowing the phrase as well. In 1890, a meddlying clergyman named Wilbur Crafts, who tried to get all kinds of moralistic laws passed in New York, wrote a tract promoting the banning of work on Sunday containing the paragraph: 

There were several factors to account for conversion, but the main one was that the culture of the Albanians was much more suited to Islam than to Christianity. First of all, the rebellion of Skanderbeg in the 15th century infuriated the Pont, so after he was finally defeated, they made a special and determined effort to convert the Albanians to Islam. This gave them a toehold for the later growth in the country. The main factor, however, was the warlike nature of the Albanians. Albania is a mountainous country and the people there have always never been simple farmers. They have often lived by sword and have a long tradition of being mercenaries, just like Skanderbeg. The style of rule there is "mountain chieftain" where each valley and hill has a mini warlord, who, in many cases ruled very tyranically over the locals. This political reality was much more conducive to the nurturing of Moslem tendencies over Christian ones. Even when Albania was a "Christian" land, they were notorious for being very fainthearted about it. Another big factor is that the Turks kind of loved them for this. While the Turks treated other captive nations contemptuously and meanly, they loved Albanian military style and often hired them by the thousands as mercenaries, who were called Arnauts. Turks even dressed up their little boys in Arnaut soldier outfits, like we used to dress up boys in cowboy outfits. The Albanians were kind of the "Navy Seals" for the Turks. This created a bond between the Turks and Albanian chieftains who were heavily Moslem. Ultimately, the upper classes and property owners in Albania became so dominantly Moslem that they were able to forcibly convert the whole country and this was done en masse.
