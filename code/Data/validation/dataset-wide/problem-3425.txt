You can see how the first type of deflation is quite bad in the long run, but the second type is very good for the consumers and in the long run. Normally, governments that aren't in debt will seek the second type of deflation, however indebted governments seek inflation and dislike both types of deflation. Why? Well, deflation is bad for debtors because they have to pay back debts tht were borrowed with higher-valued dollars, this effectively increases the amount of debt -- this is bad for indebted governments. A lot of economists also believe that under deflation, consumers will choose to not spend and will wait for the prices to go down further -- however, some economists disagree with this idea because most people are going to buy something when they need it, they aren't going to wait a long time for the prices to go down and then buy it -- we have a mentality where everybody wants things when they're new and there are also certain things (like food) that we need now, not in the future. Though, this generally depends on your view. 

Deflation is when the purchasing power of money goes up because of either a reduction in available currency or an increase in productivity. A sympton of deflation is a persistent decrease in the cost of goods and services. Well, we should look at the two possibles causes of deflation. The first possible cause of deflation is a reduction in the amount of available currency and the second is an increase in the amount of goods and services available to consumers. Let's take a look at this example. There are four oranges and four pounds, if we were to evenly distribute the amount of available money (£4.00) to the amount of available goods (four oranges), then each orange would be worth £1.00. Now, let's take a look at this second example. The amount of available currency decreases from £4.00 to £2.00. Again, if we were to evenly distribute the amount of available money (£2.00) to the amount of available goods (four oranges), then each orange would be worth £0.50. You can see how the cost of each orange has decreased -- this is good for consumers because the price of goods goes down and they can buy more (this is known as an increase in the purchasing power of money), but its bad for the government because it shows the economy is moving very slowly (known as stagnation) and they need to respond by stimulating the economy and encouraging more people to spend money -- if the economy moves too slowly and stagnates, then the economy will grow very slowly and might begin to collapse. 

He didn't define turn-taking mathematically, so I feel like it's a vague definition. There should be like an index of possible turns with max value $n$. But I'm not sure how to write it formally. He doesn't define how we map from strategies selected to payoffs. Presumably, the set of payoffs should include a value for every possible combination of strategies selected. But there should be a way to state this formally as well. He doesn't define what a strategy is. I suppose one could simply say that a strategy is the object we map from in the domain to an element in the set of payoffs (ie codomain). In that sense, anything that can be valued is a strategy, ie a possible action. 

These are points my mates and I are arguing about as we prepare for our midterm. Also, I prefer rigorous answers so if you can, feel free to be as thorough as you want. 

I have seen the capital transition equation take two forms $$K_{t+1} = sY_t +(1-\delta) K_t $$ $$\dot{K}_t = sY_t - \delta K_t$$ Obviously I can rewrite the top one to get $$K_{t+1} - K_t = sY_t - \delta K_t $$ So that suggests somehow $$\dot{K}_t \equiv K_{t+1}-K_t$$ But as far as I know, $$\dot{K}_t \equiv \frac{\partial K_t}{\partial t} = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{K_{t+h} - K_t}{h}$$ which is, as far as I know, not the same as $K_{t+1}-K_t$. my question Is $$\dot{K}_t \equiv K_{t+1}-K_t$$ right? If so, what does this mean and why isn't it the usual derivative? 

and I was supposed to use the scarcity axiom. But what does it mean to show this claim is false? The principle of scarcity is just that "resources are scarce". That's not mathematical. How can I prove the above statement is false using it? My Question: How can I tell when a question requires a proof versus merely conceptual reasoning / explaining? What is the difference between the two? 

There was a time when they did, but it's a less common tool of monetary policy now. At any rate, altering the minimum reserve ratio at this point would be pointless due to the huge quantities of excess reserves banks have been holding since the 2008 bailouts and subsequent rounds of quantitative easing. The reserve ratio is a relevant tool of monetary policy only if banks are actually at or near that ratio, which few are at this time. 

As I had hoped to learn enough macroeconomic theory to get some research ideas, my goal at the beginning of this summer was to read through and complete the problems in an introductory advanced macroeconomics text (my first-year PhD macro courses left me more stunned than enlightened). I started with The McCandless's ABCs of RBCs, and quickly found that it was above my ability level when I reached problems I didn't even know how to set up, so now I'm trying Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics. I've gotta say that after having to consult the solutions manual several times through Chapter 2 out of 12, I'm feeling rather discouraged as the solutions involve methods that are not intuitive to me and not discussed in the text. Is there even any point in someone with my skill level tackling such a task? I can't really see myself being a macroeconomic theorist after this, and it seems that the vast majority of empirical macroeconomic studies use reduced-form linear models backed by hand-waving arguments based on principles or intermediate theory, so I'm starting to doubt the utility of studying advanced theory at all. I understand this may be an an "illegal" question here on Stack Exchange, so I won't protest if it's closed. But if not, does anyone have any tips for how to proceed? 

$$AC(q) = \frac {C(q)}{q}$$ $$MC(q) = \frac{\partial C(q)}{\partial q}$$ These are the definitions. But I don't understand what the difference is. Is the average cost the cost per unit while the marginal cost is about infinitesimals? 

I am considering the Ricardian model. There is an economy with two countries $S,T$. Two goods $a,b$. Each country has linear production technology with labor ($\ell$) as only factor of production. $$y_i^j=\alpha_i^j\ell$$ where $i \in \lbrace a,b\rbrace$ and $j \in \lbrace S,T \rbrace$. $$\ell_S + \ell_T = 1$$ The firm's maximization problem is $$\max_{\lbrace \ell \rbrace} \pi^j_i = \alpha_i^j\ell p_i-w^j \ell$$ There are 3 cases to this problem Case 1: $p_i^j \alpha_i^j <w^j$ $\ell = 0$ $y_i^j = 0$ Case 2: $p_i^j \alpha_i^j > w^j$ $\ell = 1$ $y_i^j = \alpha_i^j$ Case 3: $p_i^j \alpha_i^j = w^j$ $\ell \in [0,1]$ $y_i^j = [0,\alpha^j_i]$ My Question Apparently, cases 1 and 2 aren't valid. I'm not sure why. Can someone explain? The logic is supposed to be 

My friends and I are taking some introductory macroeconomics courses and these terms keep getting thrown around without being clear how they are related. Can someone provide brief definitions for each of these and how they are different? 

Suppose I have two teachers: Adam and Bob. Suppose Adam takes 20 hours to lecture and 30 hours to grade, while Bob takes 100 hours to lecture and 60 hours to grade. In absolute terms, Adam is clearly a better teacher because he does the same work in less time. But supposedly they could still benefit from trade and specialization of labor. Why does only relative price and not absolute price matter in international trade models? 

My professor said, in practice, Marshallian demand follows the law of demand (ie that increase in price decreases demand). But he said in theory, the Marshallian case is ambiguous and it does not follow the law of demand. MY QUESTION: Why isn't the Law of Demand true for Marshallian demand? 

This would represent an extreme increase in long-run aggregate supply. In the AS/AD framework, this would result in a long-run increase in production growth and a decrease in the inflation rate. How "badly" it will disrupt today's global market? You've built an assumption that it's bad into your question, but sure, it will be bad for anyone who has invested in current energy sources. It will be fantastic, however, for anyone involved in literally any other entrepreneurial activity. The only disruption in such a sudden and unexpected technology improvement would be that some financial institutions would find themselves overinvested in the energy sector. Insofar as they cannot handle the financial capital losses, there may be a private debt crisis that pushes politicians to bail them out again (ideally using the increases in tax revenues caused by increased productivity), or to simply declare their debt null and void. This would cause some consternation, but given that people tolerated financial bailouts after the housing crisis (where financial assets were wasted without any obvious social benefits at all), it's unlikely that there would be overwhelming protest in such a scenario. The negative impacts of such a productivity shock would only be temporary, however. Energy is one of the limiting factors of production, so free energy would cause production to grow as fast as entrepreneurs can find a use for it, which would be very quickly. 

You generally set the price of "all other goods" to \$1, as "all other goods" is usually measured as "dollars worth of all other goods." Then the maximum quantity of all other goods is just the available income. Then to find the quantity of other goods Hulk buys, just find out how much money is available after he vists the gym 20 times. 

Short answer: Yes, the SRAS curve will shift after the LRAS shifts to return the short-run equilibrium (SRAS/AD) back in line with the long-run equilibrium (LRAS/AD). The reason the SRAS curve doesn't shift immediately with LRAS is that there are so-called "frictions" or "nominal rigidities" such as contracts and information gaps that prevent firms from adjusting supply plans instantly. Long answer: There are two simple "stories" we can tell to explain the dynamics of the elementary AS/AD model: the "inflation gap" story and the "output gap" story. Both of these stories are compatible with each other, so they're usually taught as both occurring at the same time. Inflation gap story: SRAS is modeled as shifting upward when expected price levels increase. We can consider the long-run (expected) equilibrium to occur at the intersection of LRAS and AD, and the short-run (actual) equilibrium to occur at the intersection of SRAS and AD. If you start in a long-run equilibrium where all three curves intersect, but then impose an LRAS shock on the model and shift the curve, then the expected price level and actual short-run price level will differ. This is what we call an inflation gap. As firm owners come to the realization that the supply shock is here to stay, they adjust their production processes to match and the SRAS curve shifts to bring the short-run equilibrium in line with the long-run equilibrium. Output gap story: SRAS is also modeled as shifting whenever prices of factors of production change. Thus the output gap generated by the supply shock becomes relevant, with actual short-run output out of line with the long-run sustainable level marked by the LRAS curve. For example, after a positive LRAS shock, the short-run equilibrium will have less output than the long-run sustainable level. The result is an abundance of resources, and the prices of factors of production will fall, causing firms to increase production and shift the SRAS to the right until actual output matches the long-run sustainable level. An opposite story can be told to explain why SRAS shifts left after a negative LRAS shock. 

If solutions exist either to UMP or EMP, then solutions exist for the other and they are inverse functions. If an inverse exists, it must be a point. 

What is the difference between constant elasticity of substitution and elasticity of substitution? Are these formulas related? How are they different concepts? I just did a whole problem set involving these and got the right answers. But my thought process was all math. I don't feel like I understand them economically. And that's what I want explained. By CES, I mean $$U(x,y) = A \left(\alpha x^{-\rho} + (1-\alpha) y^{-\rho}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\rho}}$$ By ES, I mean $$\sigma = \frac{\mathrm{d}\log \left(\frac{x}{y}\right)}{\mathrm{d}\log \left(\frac{U_y}{U_x}\right)}$$ 

Regarding question 1: From the assumption that the consumer has a single income value $m$, there can only be one value for $m$. So by the notion that $e$ and $v$ are inverses, there can only be one value $e$ for which $m$ corresponds to and thus only one $u$. So there is only one point. Regarding Question 2: If we have (1) a utility function that is continuous and locally non-satiated and (2) if $m > 0$ and (3) if both UMP and EMP exist, then they are equivalent. And $e$ and $v$ are inverses. Claim 1: Solving UMP solves EMP. Proof: Suppose bundle $c^*$ solves the UMP but not EMP. Let $c'$ solve EMP. Then (1) amount spent on $c^*$ greater then that on $c'$ and so $u(c') \geq u(c^*) $ because obviously spending more means worse off or same utility. But (2) by local nonsatiation a consumption there exists a bundle $c''$ close enough to $c'$ such that amount spent on $c''$ is less than amount spent on $c^*$ and $u(c'') > u(c^*)$. (3) Contradiction because we assumed $c^*$ solves UMP. Claim 2: Solving EMP solves UMP. Proof: Suppose bundle $c^*$ solves EMP but not UMP. Let $c'$ solve UMP. Then (1) $u(c') > u(c^*)$ even though we spend the same amount on each. That is, $c^*$ doesn't solve UMP since less utility for same $m$. Because amount spent positive, we can find $t$ where $0<t<1$ such that amount spent on $tc'$ is lower than that spent on $c^*$ yet $u(tc') > u(c^*)$ because $c^*$ does not solve the UMP. (3) Contradiction because we said $c^*$ solved EMP. Summary:
