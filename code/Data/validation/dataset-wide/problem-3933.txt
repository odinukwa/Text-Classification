Given an abelian variety $A$ over a base scheme $\text{Spec } \mathcal{O}_{K_p}$, we define the functor $P$ as taking $A \mapsto \text{colim}_n A[p^n]$, its associated $p$-divisible group. What is the essential image of $P$? Further, take the functor $\circ$, which takes a $p$-divisible group $B[p^\infty]$ to its associated formal group $B[p]^\circ$ (the connected component of the $p$-divisible group, under Tate's categorical equivalence of connected $p$-divisible groups and formal Lie groups). What is the essential image of $\circ$? In other words, how much of $p-Div$ and $FG$ can we touch via the study of abelian varieties? 

Here is my question: How do I compute the $p$-series of the 1-d formal group law associated to this higher dimensional abelian variety $\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C} / \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_7]$? I'm curious if this can be done without finding an explicit model of the variety. I have a vague idea that this can be done using its invariant differentials, but I don't know how to find the invariant differentials in the higher dimensional case. 

My understanding is that a complex-oriented spectrum is a ring spectrum $E$ with a map $MU \to E$. Analogously, a ring with a formal group law is a ring $R$ with a map $L \to R$ (where $L$ is the Lazard ring). This analogy can be made explicit (assuming that $L \to R$ is Landweber-exact for all primes): 

However, the explicit lifting condition can't just be Landweber exactness. For example: the additive formal group law, though not Landweber-exact, corresponds to $H\mathbb{Z}$; the $n$th Honda formal group law, though not Landweber-exact, corresponds to $K(n)$. 

Given a map $L \to R$, $$MU^* \simeq L \longrightarrow R \simeq Ell^*$$ This gives us a map between their Atiyah-Hirzebruch SS? $$MU^*-AHSS(X) \longrightarrow Ell^*-AHSS(X)$$ The formal group law associated to our elliptic curve $\hat{E} \simeq \text{Spf } Ell^*(\mathbb{CP}^\infty)$. 

Summary: The automorphism group of this variety at least contains $Z/2 \oplus Z/6 \simeq \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_7]^\times$,and is isomorphic to it if the variety is nondegenerate. More generally, I learned today that given $A$ of the form $\mathbb{C}^{\phi(n)/2}/\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$ (with the appropriate choice of embedding); then $Aut(A)$ is indeed simply $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]^\times$ (and $End(A)$ is $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$. To convince oneself that this is at the very least a subgroup of the endomorphism group, recall that endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^g/\Lambda$ are maps which preserve the lattice $\Lambda$ (or at least map the lattice to a scaled version of itself, such as $\Lambda \mapsto 2\Lambda$. For example, for any $x \in \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$, we can multiply component-wise every point, taking the lattice to an $x$ scaled version of itself (where we consider $\zeta_n \in \mathbb{C}$ as $e^{2 \pi i/n}$): $$\mathbb{C}^g \to \mathbb{C}^g$$ $$(p_1, ..., p_g) \mapsto (\sigma_1(x)p_1, ..., \sigma_g(x)p_g)$$ 

Let $Ell^*(X)$ be the elliptic cohomology theory (associated to a given elliptic curve $E$) of a nice space $X$. Recall the Landweber-Ravenel-Stong construction: $MU^*(X) \otimes_{MU^*} R \simeq Ell^*(X)$, where $R \simeq Ell^*$. How does the Landweber-Ravenel-Stong construction of $Ell^*(-)$ tell us how to actually compute $Ell^*(X)$ with the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence? Let $L$ be the Lazard ring, and $R$ is flat over $L$. It seems like the Landweber-Ravenel-Stong construction tells us that: 

Quick Review: The Baas-Sullivan construction cones off generators $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n \in \pi_*(MU)$ from $MU$ to get a new spectrum $MU/(\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n)$, which is isomorphic to some spectrum $E$ we wish to present as a bordism theory with singularities. This is a "geometric" alternative to tensoring out generators as we do in the Landweber-exact functor construction. 

Here is the set up of the variety of interest: Let $K= \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_7)$. Then $[K:\mathbb{Q}]= 6$. Let $A$ be the three dimensional abelian variety $\mathbb{C}^3/O_K$ over $\mathbb{C}$ where $O_K$ is embedded in $\mathbb{C}^3$ by the following three homomorphisms: $h_1, h_2, h_3: K \to \mathbb{C}$. $h_a$ is the homomorphism $K \to \mathbb{C}$ which sends $\zeta_7$ to $\zeta_7^a$. Then $A$ has complex multiplication by $O_K=\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_7]$. Let $p$ be a prime number such that $p \mod 7 = 2 \mod 7$. Then by the theory of complex multiplication, for some number field $F$, $A$ is defined over $F$ and of good reduction at a place $v$ of $F$ lying over $p$. At $v$, the formal group associated to $A$ at $v$ is the direct sum of a 1-d formal group of height $3$ and a 2-d formal group of height $2$. I think this is due to the Shimura-Taniyama formula ("Introduction to Shimura varieties" by J.S. Milne), which tells us that the slope of the Frobenius is 1/3 or 2/3. Now we know that this 1-d formal group law of height 3 exists, but what is its $p$-series? 

I have a 3 dimensional abelian variety whose formal group law breaks into a formal summand where one of the pieces is one-dimensional. I am desperately wondering how to compute the $p$-series of this one-dimensional formal group law without finding an explicit model of the abelian variety. 

Recall that a complex-oriented spectrum is a ring spectrum E with a map $MU \to E$. Analogously, a ring with a (1-d commutative) formal group law is (represented by) a ring $R$ with a map $L \to R$ (where $L$ is the Lazard ring). In the cases where $L \to R$ is Landweber exact, this can be made explicit: 

I'm trying to understand why on earth the first chern class of a line bundle in K-theory $c_1(L) = 1-L$. I understand that the first Chern class of the trivial bundle is zero, and that $H-1$ generates the reduced K-theory of $CP^1$ (where H is the canonical line bundle over $CP^1$), but there must be more reasoning behind this! Additionally, I have seen $c_1(L)$ as both $L-1$ and $1-L$, and I'm curious if this has to do with choosing the universal line bundle to be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ or $\mathcal{O}(-1)$, respectively. 

Here's my question: Given a Shimura variety, how does one compute the maximal order of its automorphism group? For example, the variety $\mathbb{C}^{\times 3}/ \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_7]^{\times 3}$ where the embedding is given by $\sigma_1 \times \sigma_2 \times \sigma_3: \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_7]^{\times 3} \to \mathbb{C}^{\times 3}$. Here, we look at its automorphisms over $\mathbb{F}_p$ where $p$ is $2$ or $4$ mod $7$. I have heard that Shimura varieties have finite dimensional automorphism groups (analogous to the fact that $Aut(A, p)$ is finite, where $p$ is a polarization of the abelian variety $A$). What is the automorphism group of this Shimura variety? 

To construct TMF, we're looking at $T: (Aff^{et}_{/M_{ell}})^{op} \to E_\infty$-$\text{Ring spectra}$ It's my understanding that to make sense of $TMF := \Gamma(T) := \text{holim } T(U_i)$, we need our target category to be enriched in spaces (where $U_i$ := an affine cover of $M_{ell}$, and $T(U_i)$ : cosimplicial diagrams). Over a point, $TMF$ looks like either height 1 or height 2 Morava E-theory, both of which can certainly be presented via the Baas-Sullivan construction (Morava E-theories can be constructed by starting with BP and killing off generators). I've been told that we don't have a method to check that presentations of Morava E-theories (as bordism theories with singularities) are $E_\infty$-ring spectra. Can we construct a Baas-Sullivan presentation of TMF? It doesn't quite make sense to construct a map from the (derived?) Landweber-exact theory to the Baas-Sullivan presentation to show that the presentation has $E_\infty$-structure, so I'm not sure what to do here. 

Background: Given an elliptic curve $E$, it seems that $max(ord(Aut(E)))$ over the prime 2 is 24, and $(max(ord(Aut(E)))$ over the prime 3 is 12. The endomorphism algebra of an elliptic curve over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ is, after tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$, either an imaginary quadratic field or the unique division algebra $D_p$ which is non-split at $p$ and infinity. So, in order to compute the maximal order of the automorphism algebra, we just compute the units of $D_p$, and then count them. 

Let $E$ be an elliptic spectrum. We know the ring spectrum $MU$, and thus our choice of elliptic curve determines $E$. In other words, the formal group law (associated to the completion of our elliptic curve about the origin) gives us a map $L \to R$, which determines $E^*(-) \simeq MU^*(-) \otimes_{L} R$. Despite this relatively clear path from elliptic curve to cohomology theory, the following is frustratingly unclear to me! How does changing the elliptic curve actually affect what its associated cohomology theory detects? More explicitly: What's an example of 2 elliptic curves over the same ring s.t. their associated cohomology theories detect different things? 

Let $//$ denote the Hopf algebra quotient. We know that: $$HF_{2}^*(ko) \simeq A//A(1)$$ $$HF_2^*(tmf) \simeq A//A(2)$$ By Hopf invariant one, we know there is no $X$ such that $HF_2^*(X) \simeq A//A(3)$. I ask for the next best thing. What are some examples of $X$ for $n \geq 3$ such that $$HF_2^*(X) \otimes A(n) = \bigoplus_i A \text{, or more generally, } HF_2^*(X) \text{ contains } A//A(n) \text{?} $$ I have heard that Stong has some results along the lines of $X = MO\langle 9 \rangle$ contains $A//A(3)$, and in general $MO\langle 6+n \rangle$ contains $A//A(n)$ for $n \geq 2$. However, I was not able to find the source. 

Grojnowski constructs a $S^1$-equivariant cohomology theory over a complex elliptic curve $E$, designed to trivially satisfy: $$E^*_{S^1}(pt) = E$$ The functor $E^*_{S^1}(-)$ takes in a space $X$ with an $S^1$ action, and is stalkwise defined over each point $e \simeq (e_1, e_2)$ in the elliptic curve $E \simeq S^1 \times S^1$, where $X^e := X^{e_1, e_2} = \{ x \in X \text{ s.t. } xe_1 = xe_2 = x \}$. $$(E^*_{S^1}(X))_{(e)} := H_{S^1}(X^{e})$$ Grojnowski proves that $E^*_{S^1}(X)$ is a sheaf over $E$. More specifically, he proves that $E^*_{S^1}(X)$ is a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded sheaf of super-commutative $\mathcal{O}_E$-algebras. How can we similarly specify such a sheaf on an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$? I understand that over a curve $E$ in positive characteristic, if the curve is disconnected, we just use empty gluing conditions to construct a sheaf over $E$ that is stalkwise $H^*_{S^1}(X^e)$. However, with such a naive approach it seems like we can't expect to vary the elliptic curve $E$ over [a substack of $M_{ell}$ which has both height 1 and height 2 curves] and have the corresponding cohomology theories $E^*_{S^1}(-)$ which are defined stalkwise over this substack satisfy a sheaf condition. Here's my question: When we continuously vary the elliptic curve $E$, how does it affect Grojnowksi's construction? 

It was told that $Ell^*(X)$ is computationally simpler than computing $MU^*(X)$. But we seem to need to know $MU^*(X)$ before we can compute $Ell^*(X)$, so I must be missing something! Do we need to know the AHSS of $MU^*(X)$ before we can compute the AHSS of $Ell^*(X)$? Edit wrt computing the AHSS of $Ell^*(X)$: It was explained to me that we don't need $MU^*(X)$, we need $Ell^*(pt)$ and $H^*(X)$ (plus differentials) to compute $Ell^*(X)$. We know $MU^*(pt)$ and thus our choice of elliptic curve (or better, it's ground ring) determines $Ell^*(pt)$. 

Quick Background: The $p$-series of $F$ (where $F$ is a formal group law over a graded ring $R$) will be of the form $[p](x) = px + v_1x^{p^1} + ... + v_nx^{p^n} + ...$ ; $(F, R)$ is Landweber-exact if the sequence $(p, v_1, ..., v_n)$ is $R$-regular for all $p$ and $n$. Recall the the Landweber-Ravenel-Stong Construction: $MU^*(X) \otimes_{L} R \simeq E^*(X)$, where $MU^* \simeq L$ and $R \simeq E^*(pt)$. The Landweber-exact functor theorem states that if $(F, R)$ is Landweber-exact, then $E^*(X)$ will satisfy the generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms. An object $M$ in an abelian tensor category $C$ is 'flat' if for all $X \in Obj(C)$ , the functor $X \to X \otimes M$ preserves exact sequences. 

However, naively gluing these octagons together gives me no insight on how to visualize the $\gamma_i$ as loops on these octagons, much less write the necessary associated line integral. In attempting to understand how to write $\gamma_i$ as line integrals on these octagons, it seems that I must understand how to tile a 3-torus with octagons (since every gluing of my octagons I seem to try gives me a horribly embedded 3-torus). So, I am attempting to mimic Klein's tiling of $x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$ by heptagons in order to get a tiling of a 3-torus by octagons. In other words, finding a part of the {8, 3} hyperbolic plane tiling which glues together to give a 3-torus. In conclusion, I restate the same question: 

My question is not "are there rings with (1-d commutative) formal group laws for which there is no corresponding map between ring spectra," but instead along the lines of "how do I build an explicit example." Edit: A stupid explicit example of a formal group law that doesn't lift to a complex-orientable spectrum is any formal group law over $\mathbb{F}_p$ that is not isomorphic to the additive formal group law over $\mathbb{F}_p$. The only complex orientable spectra associated to formal group laws over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is $H\mathbb{F}_p$ (everything is concentrated in one degree). However, we can of course have a formal group law over $\mathbb{F}_p[[u_n, u_n^{-1}]]$ which lifts to a periodic ring spectrum. What are explicit obstructions to realizability of formal group laws as complex-oriented ring spectra? A vague guess is that the difference might come from the algebra of the ring $MU^*$ behaving differently from the 'homotopical' algebra of the ring spectrum $MU$, but I'm not sure how to proceed from this. 

Notation: $G_{n,m}$ is the formal group whose Dieudonné $W(\mathbb{F}_p)$-module is isomorphic to $W(\mathbb{F}_p)/(F^n - V^m)$. For step 2, he uses the Jacobian variety $J_a$ associated to the family of curves $y^p - y = x^{p^a-1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p^a}$, where $a = 1, 2, 3, ...$. The decomposition of the formal group $\hat{J}_a$ contains all $G_{n, m}$ such that $m+n \mid a(p-1)$. So, for any pair of coprime $(n, m)$ and any $p$, $\hat{J}_{n + m}$ contains a piece isogenous to $G_{n,m}$. (There is the subtlety that we are working in $FG$ up to isogeny rather than isomorphism here, so this answer only tells us about the category $FG$ up to isogeny.) A note on the difference in base field from my original question: I asked about $\mathcal{O}_{K_p}$ where $K_p$ is a finite extenstion of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, whereas Manin considers $\mathbb{F}_q$. It seems that since the varieties $A$ are defined over finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_q$, if they have good reduction we can extend them (via the Néron model?) to $\mathbb{Z}_q$, and take their special fiber to get to varieties defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$.
