This Wikipedia page on Stellar Evolution is a good starting point with lots of links to more info. A star is a huge sphere of mostly hydrogen. Like any large mass it has a gravitational field and that field acts on star itself. So it would always want to collapse to as dense a sphere as possible under it's own gravity. Now as the density increases, particularly at the center, the pressure also increases and so does the temperature. When these are high enough the core of the star will be able to fuse hydrogen (and later other materials) into heavier elements. Doing so releases huge amounts of energy and this is what creates all that light we see. But the energy released also prevents the star from collapsing more. And it can stay that way (more or less) for billions of years. It is this energy produced by fusion at the core that balances the gravitational force (weight) of the rest of the star trying to crush the core. So fusion that generates more energy than it requires to happen is essential to keep a star "alive". After a long time, the hydrogen at the core runs out and the star starts to burn heavier elements at the core (helium, carbon, etc. ). It does that until those run out and (roughly) we reach elements like Iron remaining. At that point fusing those elements no longer generates enough energy to stop the star collapsing and it starts to collapse again, but very, very rapidly. Exactly what happens next depends mostly on the mass of the star. It can end up as a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole. But the final collapse is a very rapid process and quite violent. Once the useful fuel at the core runs out, the stars dies a spectacular death one way or another. What is a black hole (in simple terms) ? Gravity is a result of the way mass (or even energy) can distort space. Beyond a certain point this distortion becomes so great that everything on one side becomes trapped inside a "surface" called the event horizon. An event horizon is what a black hole actually is - no event horizon, no black hole. Within the black hole, space is distorted in a way that's basically impossible to describe without some mathematics. The effect is that there is no direction you can move in and no speed you can travel at which will not lead you to the center of the black hole - the singularity. Don't even try and visualize it, it just isn't a common sense idea. This even works with light. Now an event horizon is not a surface you can feel. You can actually travel across an event horizon (but only inward, not outward !). So this change in the way space-time is distorted is not something that is sudden or obvious to the person doing the falling. Back to our star collapsing. As it collapses (without energy from fusion to stop that), it becomes denser and denser. Now if it is large enough it will collapse to a black hole, because the core will become so dense from the collapse that it will be enough to form an event horizon. Our Sun is not large enough to do that. 

This seems to be the core of your doubt. I'd really suggest you read the answers to questions on this subject on Physics SE, but a few notes on this specific point. 

You can use Celestia to get a view of the sun in the night sky from other solar systems, just like this guy did, although the post is a little old. 

There are roughly 100 billion stars (quite probably more) in the Milky Way galaxy (ours). Of those it is thought that about 85% of them are in multi-star systems (binary, triplet, etc.). There are thought to be of the order of 10 trillion galaxies in the visible universe (for this I used this article on Space.com). So something like $100\times 10^9 \times 10 \times 10^{12} = 10^{24}$ stars in the universe. Let's says about half of the stars in multi-star systems are in binary systems (not triplets, etc.). That gives us a (ludicrously rough) estimate of about $4\times 10^{23}$ binary systems in the universe. Which brings us back to : 

Yes, or at least to a good approximation. Because the planets affect each other's motion to a small extent (and also because of relativistic effects) the motion is not quite elliptical. 

You should use one of the precisely defined terms of specific measures of orbital period, which are described on this Wikipedia page. You might get away with just "orbital period" is you're not using it in a context that requires precision. For length of day there's synodic day as well as sidereal period. There's a discussion on the difference between these here. 

The furthest distance Venus is from the Sun is 0.73 AU The furthest distance Jupiter is from the Sun is 5.46 AU The closest distance Jupiter is fro the Sun is 4.95 AU So if we assume the orbits are concentric circles (they're not !) then : 

There's no problem : you can't travel faster than light : keep repeating that mantra and all will be well. :-) 

Strictly speaking the Sun's motion is going to be dominated by the gas giants and the planets and one asteroid is going to have negligible effect on it compared to those. However if we assume there are no other items we can get an approximate idea of the effect. You can use the similarity of the orbits. The Sun ( in this simplified model ) follows a complimentary orbit around the center of mass of the two bodies. The distances you have for the size of the obit scale like this : $$r_1 = \frac \mu m_1 r$$ $$r_2 = \frac \mu m_2 r$$ where $\mu$ is the reduced mass : $$\mu = \frac { m_1 m_2 } { m_1 + m_2 }$$ And as you can see $r = r_1 + r_2$ is the distance between the two bodies. Now as you can see from those equations, the most massive body moves the least. The mathematics comes from the way the standard two body problem is solved. It might be instructive for you to compare the effect of your asteroid to that of Jupiter or Earth. 

The centre of something ( anything ) has to be defined in some way by the properties of the something and a coordinate system. So you can in principle define a centre to the universe, but it only has a meaning in the context of the chosen definition. You could easily define a different measure that produces a different centre. And you can define a centre even on the surface of your balloon, simply by arbitrary selection. An edge to the universe requires a context. How do we define it ? How do we detect it ? The only meaningful measure of this ( in a human sense ) that I know of is "how far can I see ?". That keeps changing. So at the moment I would say "centre is arbitrary" and "edge is unknown". 

On this point note that the black hole and the rest of the galaxy already effect us gravitationally, and have done for about 20 galactic orbits already with no obvious effect. The black hole at the galaxy's center is large, but actually not very much of a problem - it's gravitational influence is pretty relaxed until you're very, very, very close to it - think light year. This is not an issue we're going to have. Gravitational forces between individual stars are pretty small on average, and we'd expect no major effect from those unless we had a relatively close approach. The most "worrying" of these is the one coming in about 1.3 million years with Gliese 710. I personally expect to be dead by then, but good luck to the rest of you. There is another possible close approach by a star in about 250,000 years, but that's not as widely accepted an estimate. Again, I'll be dead by then anyway, but there's plenty of time to build a shelter in the basement if ya want to. 

We'll simplify things by using the pretty good approximation that Earth and Venus have circular orbits. We'll also assume Earth is a perfect sphere - another good approximation. We're also assuming Earth's rotation is not at an angle to the plane of it's orbit (that's the worse approximation !). Finally we're going to assume the orbits are not inclined (not a bad approximation, but not strictly true). The maths would get messy if we didn't do those things, so it turns out that the maths works out that the number of degrees that's the maximum the Earth can rotate through and still see Venus after the sun goes down is approximately : $$\theta = 90^\circ-cos^{-1}\left(\frac {r_{venus}} {r_{earth}}\right)$$ Now $\frac {r_{venus}} {r_{earth}} \approx 0.72$ and this means $\theta \approx 46^\circ$ If you think about $46^\circ$ of rotation out of a quarther circle that's slightly more than half, and a quarter circle's worth of rotation of the Earth is about 6 hours, so that angle represents our ability to see Venus for (at most) three hours after sunset and three hours before sunrise. This is also discussed in this article. The technical term for these angles is elongation. The actual maximum elongation is slightly over $47^\circ$ so the simplifications didn't do much damage to our estimate ! As it happens this year (in January) we had an elongation of Venus that was almost the maximum. It varies (due to the factors we simplified) between $45^\circ$ and and slightly over $47^\circ$. 

It doesn't work that way. No one has found a repulsive version of gravity and there is no evidence this is even possible. And in science, we go by the evidence. 

Gravitational waves are a distortion of space-time outside the black hole. They don't have to escape, because they're already outside. 

The rotational period ( or whether a body is tidal locked ) is a factor here. A tidal locked body has a hot spot on one side and a cold spot on another. Rotation may also affects average temperatures. Season depends on orbital factors. Simply saying it's one season or another does not tell you the distance you are from the star, which is the single most important factor ( combined with the power of the star ). However in terms of making a very basic calculation you can use a black body radiation calculation and thermal equilibrium to get something. You can see more on this at these links : $URL$ $URL$ It's a pretty good predictor considering it's simplicity. Note the impact of atmosphere and ocean. Note also that significant energy is being radiated by some bodies. This slide show has several equations that may help you. It also has an interesting model on the effect of an ice cap, which I'd not seen before. $URL$ 

We don't have theories that can describe the big bang (or whatever happened) properly so we can't say anything definite about the big bang itself, let alone if/what was before it. We would need (at a minimum) something like a quantum field theory for gravity and we don't have one yet. We've no reason to think that's all we'd need. It's not even possible (as I understand it) to define "before" the big bang. Time, in essence, started at the big bang. It has no common sense meaning beyond that. 

Normally three planets would not line up along a simple line like that. Planets have orbits with different inclinations, so at best they'd be in the same plane. Working that out requires a detailed calculation of their motions. The simplest approximation is to actually assume everything has the same inclination and treat the orbits as circles (which they're not precisely). For this simple model, a planet's angular position $\theta$ at any time $t$ is given by : $$\theta(t) = \theta_0+t\frac {2\pi} T$$ Where $T$ is the orbital period and $\theta_0$ is the initial angle. What you want is the value of $t$ satisfying : $$\theta_1(t) = \theta_2(t) + 2m\pi = \theta_3(t)+2n\pi$$ Where the $n$ and $m$ values are integers. Now doing this for two planets is easy, we get : $$t_{12}=\left(\frac {\theta_{10}-\theta_{20}}{2\pi} - m\right)\frac{T_1T_2}{T_2-T_1}$$ $$t_{13}=\left(\frac {\theta_{10}-\theta_{30}}{2\pi} - n\right)\frac{T_1T_3}{T_3-T_1}$$ Remember we have to work out those $m$ and $n$ values to get a result ! But the problem is that we need to get integer values and all the other values are real numbers. This means that there may be no (exact) solution that produces integer values and hence no one time when they all line up. Now in the real world their are some other issues : 

Dark matter does not mean that it's just not radiating in the visible part of the spectrum. It means it's not radiating in any part of the EM spectrum much. If dark matter exists (and that's not certain) it won't interact with most matter much at all. If dark matter were in star-like objects, it sounds very unlikely that there would not be any EM radiation as a result of the interactions that would result in a star-like object. We'd detect it if it were there. So I don't think that's likely. 

Perhaps try the PBS Space Time channel on YouTube, as it discusses these things at a reachable level. It recently discussed life ( advanced technological civilizations ) and why we cannot see any evidence of them in several videos. Worth a look and they also make great introductions to advanced current thinking in space-time physics, including ideas like the multiverse, which often mislead people. They usually supply links for people who want to get more serious about study as well as the video overview. 

If it has internal heat and that the main source of energy in the ocean, then it won't ever be in equilibrium. The internal heat must slowly decrease anyway and the ocean will be warmed from the bottom, setting up a bottom-to-top circulation. It would be a bit like a giant pot on a stove. But in principle any body of water can have a dissolved oxygen content. I don't know how the circulation of water would affect it.
