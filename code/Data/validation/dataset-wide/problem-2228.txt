Since "He" can be tagged, after he has been forced to advance, then I would say yes - a tagged forced runner is a force out. The language describes how a forced play happens, but does not differentiate between the methods of getting the forced runner out for it to be a force out. 

Since the ball needs to be struck "directly to the front wall" it cannot hit a side wall before hitting the front wall. However, there are no restrictions on what it can hit between the front wall and the bounce in the quarter court (except the floor and any "out" area). Rules: $URL$ 

To give a little context, in most stages the time is rounded to the nearest second. But in time trial stages, the times are recorded to the nearest hundredth of a second, specifically to act as a tie breaker in this situation. It seems that if that's STILL a tie, then they look at lowest rank-sum over the entire competition. The rules are here. The English version starts on page 27 (of the pdf - page 26 of the printed version) and Article 24 starts on page 38/37. There are other tie breakers in place for the other big awards given out at the Tour De France, but I stuck with just the time winner (yellow jersey) for this answer. $URL$ 

The rules are a bit complex. The word "let" is mentioned 39 times in the online US Squash Rules. Under rule 12, Interference, here are some of the more common uses of "Let", "No Let" and "Stroke": 

This situation falls under the first category (intentionally interfering with a thrown ball). Even though he doesn't gain an advantage, the rule does not provide an exception for that (and the comments under rule 7.8b are relevant to plays being attempted on a batted ball, and are not relevant to interference with a thrown ball). The comments for rule 7.8b, however, do provide interesting comments on your second scenario, where "the base is no sanctuary" for a batted ball. The comments on rule 7.8b say the following: 

There are a couple reasons, but the primary one is thinking about the location of the runners by the time the ball is picked up. There are a few things you're correct about: 

You weren't specific as to your question. Are you asking what should you actually do in that situation, or how you should improve your reaction to defenders? If the first, it depends on the situation and the defender you're facing. Good defenders will try to force you to the outside, which means that's the easier way to go, but then you're generally looking to cross the ball, not shoot it yourself. A fake to the outside can sometimes draw a reaction, or rolling your foot across the top of the ball and quickly reversing direction may get you around him. Attackers can sometimes put the ball between the defenders legs, or if you have support a simple give and go can also work. There isn't one solution to this, since it's so situation dependent. If you're asking how to improve, then you should find a defender who wants to practice his/her defense and go practice with them. In practice, decide what you're going to try beforehand so you don't have to make the instantaneous decision. Practice a move 5-10 times, then another move 5-10 times, then another move 5-10 times, then cycle back around and try the first one again. You can start off with a "dummy" defender - just put out a box or a backpack to mark where the defender is until you get the moves down. Then bring in someone live who will actually respond to you. Once you've practiced it a lot outside of the game, it'll make a big difference in the game. Once in the game, pay attention to the defender's body language. If they are trying to force you to the outside, their body will be angled upfield so that they can more easily cut in (but not as easily cut out). If they're looking to slow you down, they'll be facing you about 1-2 yards away. If they're challenging you directly, they'll be approaching close. The situation will help you make the decision. Defenders in motion can be more easily cut around with a small move backwards or to the side. Charging defenders most often warrant a give and go, but if you're good with you feet you can get around them yourself. A defender who's trying to force you out may warrant just taking the outside and putting a cross in, but only if you have support in the box. 

FIFA Club World Cup is NOT the actual World Cup. The two tournaments are not related whatsoever. FIFA World Cup This is a competition organized by FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association). This tournament is played . This is contested by the 209 member . These 209 countries compete in the qualifiers of each region and 31 teams qualify (The 32nd spot is reserved for the hosting nation) for the actual World Cup. The current champions are Spain who defeated Netherlands 1-0 in the finals in Johannesburg, South Africa on 11th July 2010. The next World Cup is scheduled to be played in Brazil in 2014. FIFA Club World Cup This is a competition organized by FIFA that is played . This is contested between the top of each continent. Totally 7 teams contest (Champions League winners of the 6 continents along with the current champion of the host nation) for this trophy. The current champions are Corinthians who defeated Chelsea 1–0 in Yokohama, Japan on 16th December 2012. The next Club World Cup is scheduled to take place in Morocco in December 2013. 

There is no limit to the number of red cards that a referee can give, though the game would be stopped as soon as there are less than 7 players of a team remaining legally on the pitch. As of Law 3 in the FIFA Law Book, there cannot be less than 7 players of a team, on the field during play. In effect, a maximum of 4 on-field players of the same team can be dismissed. Once 5 on-field players (substitutes do not count) of the same team are red carded, the match ends. If the referee has red-carded 4 players and all 7 substitutes of each team (22 players in total), the game can still continue, provided there are no further red cards to players of either side. The law (for continuation of the game) however, states only the on-field players. There is no limit to the number of red cards that can be shown to the substitutes on the bench, the manager and the coaching staff. Also, red cards can be handed to the on-field players/substitutes/coaching staff after the game has ended based on the referee reports and video analysis (wherever applicable). The record for the most red-cards handed out in a single match is during a fifth tier Argentinian league game between Claypole and Victoriano Arenas, where 36 red cards were shown. 

Over the past couple of seasons, overtaking in Formula 1 has moved from sheer car power and driver skill to also include technology like KERS and DRS. 

Basic level of fielding or batting is simpler for a newbie as it is just stopping + picking up the ball or swinging arms trying to make contact between the bat and the ball. However bowling which consists of a run-up, a leap with simultaneous swinging of arms just before releasing the ball makes is sound like a sequence straight out of a Bollywood song. Like with any other sport, technique is easier learnt and mastered as kids than with an adult trying it for the first time. However, with practice, anyone can learn to bowl with a decent level of competence. The trick is in not rushing things, instead taking it one step at a time. Maybe you can follow the below steps, 

No. this will not be a dismissal as it has neither touched the the batsman's bat nor the glove holding the bat. 

Free-hit delivery: The delivery that immediately follows the no-ball (overstepping) in limited overs cricket is a . This means that the batsman cannot be dismissed in any way apart from a run out, handling the ball, hitting the ball twice or obstructing the field. So, if the ball hits the stumps and goes to the boundary, the batsman is not-out. Instead the batting team get as for the ball reaching the boundary. If the batsman has nicked the ball before it hit the stumps on its way to the boundary, then all 4 runs are awarded added to the batsman's score. Long story short, if a batsman gets bowled off a free hit and the ball goes to boundary, then YES, 4 runs will be added to the batting side. 

Take a look how quick professional players are on the T and fast they move around the court. They are well-trained top athletes and can easily reach all four corners from the T. Against players on this level a drop shot is a high risk shot to play if the opponent is in front of you on the T. The opponent has a short way to the ball, probably even shorter than your way back to the T. If your drop-shot isn't inch-perfect it'll backfire: You'll either get a counter-drop or a straight/cross drive against the direction of your movement, and suddenly find yourself under pressure. Even worse, your drop shot might go wrong and end up in the tin or bouncing back towards the T and your opponent. These are gifts to your opponent (in the latter case the opponent will hold on the ball until you've committed to a corner, then send the ball another way, beyond your reach); your attack gave the opponent a cheap and easy point. 

In a tournament however you should rather not ask; it would just reveal your weak spot to the opponent and show them that they hit a sore point. I would not blame your opponent for making even more compliments afterwards; it's part of the game and a legitimate strategy to win—we see weaker players beat better ones just because of stronger focus and better mental protection every day, even in professional tournaments. Instead, take it as a training exercise to improve your focus and your psychological stability. Casual chatter and compliments should not put you off balance in a tournament match; if they do that is something that you can work on with exercises and mental training. I used to play against "talkers" a lot, even against people who would make entire games by fishing for cheap points and lets (which is hard to prevent without a referee). It's not fun per se, but it's a great exercise to learn to shut all else out and focus on your game not your opponents behaviour. And in the end, a confident victory against a "talking point fisher" feels all the better 8) 

Hence the "drill-like" length game you'll typically see on professional games. It's goal is to move the opponent out of T position: If you hit a perfect length the opponent will have to move deep into the back corner and struggle to play a good return, at which point you can attack towards the front wall with a drop shot and force your opponent go a long way at least. 

Rules 15.5 and 15.6 could apply, theoretically. Among dangerous play and direct abuse these rules also bar unfair behaviour and deliberately distracting the opponent. With a favourable referee you might have luck with complaining about your opponent, but I think it's unlikely. I doubt any referee is likely to award conduct warnings for mere casual chatter under these provisions; not only do we see far worse conduct on professional tournaments every day with no referee action, even in everyday life you would have a hard time convincing anyone that casual compliments are "unfair" or "deliberately distracting". Squash is no chess, and psychology is just part of the game. You are not entitled to have your focus protected from casual chatter, and indeed, you are responsible for maintaining your focus regardless of court action all by yourself. 

In a casual game I would just politely ask my opponent, along the lines of "Hey, thanks for these compliments. I'm sorry to say though that they really affect my focus; would you mind if we played silently for the rest of the match?" If you ask politely, and as a question, I think a decent person would do as you ask; if they don't they are perhaps not the person you should play against if their behaviour stresses you. And that's totally fine, not everyone is fun to play, and you wouldn't go to a pub for a beer with some folks either, would you? After all, in a casual game you are playing for fun, so you should not force yourself to do so much emotional labour.
