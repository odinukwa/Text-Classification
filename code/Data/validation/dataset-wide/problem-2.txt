This society is run as cross between a caste society and medieval fiefdoms. It should be trivial to keep the lower classes in their place. This is a shipboard culture. Remember the lower classes are actually the crew. Anyone steps out of line, who breaks the proper lines of command will be stepped on promptly. Essentially this is Naval discipline writ large. Expect it to be brutal and unforgiving. Remember the lash and keel hauling. Walking the plank is always a choice option. Probably, most of this is unnecessary. Ships are fragile and easily destroyed by the vicissitudes of the marine environment. The crew will stay in line for the survival of the vessel. Note well the same thing applies to the officer class. Everybody has to work together to survive. As for thousands of ships where the crew have taken over and formed their seafaring nation, that couldn't easier. Discipline can always break down. It only takes a few bad officers and rumbles of mutiny will start quickly. Bad commanders can endanger everybody on a vessel, and it's easy enough for them to go for a walk over the ship's railing. Usually when no-one is looking. Some fool of an officer will want to make an example of some of the crew, just keep them in their place, and before you know it the rest of the officers are swinging by the yard arm. Life at sea can be unforgiving. If this maritime society is run as a cross between a caste system and medieval fiefdoms, then revolution will always be bubbling beneath the surface. Good communications will give the crew examples of successful mutinies which, given the right circumstances, they will eagerly follow. The officer class will try hard to control the information reaching the crew. Underlings are often past masters at outwitting their so-called superiors. 

Hydraulic shock using explosives will crush steel. The cube of steel needs to be immersed in water, held firmly in position, and an explosive charge is detonated. The resulting shock wave will crush the cube into whatever shape the outer structure holding it underwater is. 

The Earth is better surveyed than is generally realized. It is probable that geophysical survey techniques would have revealed the existence of an underground megastructure. 

Other posters of answers and comments have discussed the impossibility of a nearby massive back hole. Also, the hypernova has too many problems to be worth considering. This does not prevent there being three pairs of binary star system with the 10 to 20 light year range. This is reasonably plausible. So how to do it? You can follow the example of previous science fiction authors. For example, Fred Hoyle and Geoffrey Hoyle's Fifth Planet (1963) has a planetary system called Helios, with a system of five planets, passing close to our solar system. Now this is something that hasn't, isn't or will not happen. The close passage of Helios happens in 2087. If this had happened in the real world Helios would have been visible in our skies for millennia. It would have a major aspect of astronomy which it would have dominated culture, been part of our stories, and integral to history. Fred Hoyle was a major scientist and would have known he was rearranging the universe to make interstellar travel easier to do, for the story. Basically you can do the same thing rearrange space within ten to twenty light years and add the three binary stars you want to have in your fictional future. Too many writers allow themselves to be dominated the tyranny of the real world, forgetting writers have the privilege of rejigging the world to better help their story to happen. Just take a list of the nearest stars within 20 light years and add your three fictional systems. Bingo! If you want to devise a plausible means of slipping your three binary stars into being within 20 light years, just assume there is a compact, dense cloud of gas and dust that blocks seeing the three binary stars. The three binary stars can be relatively close to each other, or arranged in an approximate line of sight from our position in space to be blocked from observation, so effectively all three binaries are invisible. The dust cloud could be relatively close to the solar system as long as the three binaries lie along that line of sight. 

"How can I explain polytheistic humanoid gods without creating two contradictory mythologies"? By creating a mythology in which a monotheistic deity creator creates the world with polytheistic humanoid gods as part of the mix. The short answer is a deity did it. Sorry to say, it's that simple. Now I shall rest on the seventh day. 

As I said in my comment above the question of convergent evolution is a tautology. Now certain functions have evolved several times independently. For example, flight has evolved several times and in different ways. Similarly for eyes where the vertebrate eye and octopus eye perform the same function but are structurally different. In essence what we need to consider is whether on a planet sufficiently similar to our own Earth in terms of its age and physical characteristics, and possessing a well developed biosphere is likely to evolve humanoid lifeforms. So does convergent evolution have a preference** for humanoids? The real question is whether the tetrapod bodyform is a morphology that has a high probability of arising on earthlike planets. The humanoid morphology is a modified tetrapod, and able to stand upright, at least, enough of the time. What we call humanoid is a bipedal tetrapod, i.e., a four limbed organism that walks on two legs. Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart's Evolving the Alien: The science of extraterrestrial life (2002)***, reprinted in paperback as What Does A martian Look Like?, proposed evolution will create two broad categories of organisms and ecosystems. They call these two categories parochial and universal. The universal is easiest to understand this are biological adaptations that will appear whether environmental conditions are similar. While the parochial will be unique or extremely rare adaptations. For example, we can expect adaptations for flight and eyesight to occur on any life-bearing earthlike planet with a mature biosphere. This is a universal adaptation. But woodpeckers may be rare. This assertion is based on the rarity of woodpeckers-like species on this planet. Then this is a parochial adaptation. If this set of conditions applies on other earthlike planets, then woodpeckeroids will few and far between. If the humanoid bodyplan is a universal adaptation, then we should reasonably expect them to be present on earthlike planets. If it's parochial adaptation, then no convergent evolution won't favour humanoids on earthlike planets. Is there any way of determining whether the humanoid form is either a universal or parochial adaptation? Scientifically no. Short of exploring earthlike planet similar to our own, and interviewing their sapient inhabitants. If there is an abundance of humanoids in the cosmos, then we can safely say that convergent evolution does produce humanoid lifeforms. If the most prevalent sapient lifeform on earthlike planets is something that resembles the cross between a giant spider and a jellyfish, the answer is no. Also, on the downside we're the ugly ones in the universe. This answer has come down on the side of scientific uncertainty. There is no litmus test to determine the question either one way or the other. This is why any question about convergent evolution is a tautology. But you need to have lots of examples of the same form or function evolving multiple times and each effectively independently of the others. It's possible, but who knows? The prevalence of humanoid lifeforms in science fiction is old-fashioned hominid chauvinism and a lack of imagination on the part of writers. In cinema or TV, it's due to the deplorable lack of non-humanoid actors, despite all their claims of trying to encourage diversity, and the high cost of special effects in realising non-humanoid aliens. Frankly all we know how humanoids can walk, talk and chew gum. But when it comes to those convergently evolved giant spider-jellyfish hybrid creatures, what do they do? **: The use of the word 'preference' is only a figure of speech. Evolution only favours probabilities and not specific outcomes. That way teleology and madness lie. ***: Essential reading for any budding xenobiologist or junior worldbuilder. Highly recommended.
