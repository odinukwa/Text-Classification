Set up a wiki for the various useful professional links that people find. Put your links here. However, you will never teach people new techiques simply by sending them links. It sounds as if your colleagues are in need of updating their training, so propose some training classes to your boss. You have written a new process, train them in what you did and how to maintain it. Set up an hour a week for training and everyone gets a topic to train on in a rotating fashion. What we did in one place was have the presenters be either people who were good at a particular technique or people who needed to learn it. But no one got out of presenting. The boss or the team could determine the list of subjects. We put out a schedule for a couple of months at a time. Code review is another good way to get people up-to-speed. If they can't follow your code in a code review, they will never be able to maintain it. Plus it gives the person a chance to ask questions about what you did and why and because they are trying to ensure your code is right, they are more likely to listen to the answers if only to prove you wrong. Code review can also ensure that the new techinques are used. Code fails if it uses bad technique. 

Consider that there may be a third choice - ask if you can make up the hours through the rest of the week and then go and still get paid the full amount. 

Many of us in the IT world have ideas we would like to see implemented, things like agile processes, code review, new technologies, refactoring, even, in some places, source control. Many of use would like to have more influence in the way the products are designed and created rather than just being given a set of requirements and told to build them. We want a chance to exercise our creativity. We hate being stuck with a bad idea because that is what the client already agreed to before we were ever asked if it was a good idea. Many of us in IT would like to get rewarded for the work we do. Even if we don't want a promotion (because we are at the highest technical role avaiable), we still want good performance reviews, pay raises, and bonuses. We hate it when the product is delivered and the client hates it and immdiately wants changes because we made assumptions that weren't the same as their assumptions. Perhaps you have had a conversation along the lines of: 

Organizations restructure all the time. Sometimes they add layers of management especially when the company is growing and that just means there is too much work for the director to directly supervise everyone. To evaluate if this is a problem for you then you need to think about the answers to these questions: Have there been any performance issues brought to my attention. If so then yes you have likely been downgraded. Has my pay been affected? If yes, then you have been downgraded. How does my report status compare to others in the organization who are doing equivalent work? If you are the only person reporting to this mentor and all the other devs report to the director still, then there could (note could not must) be a problem. If the group you are in does something specialized like say Data Science as opposed to a general development, then probably not, otherwise, this is a key signal there may be a problem. Is there an obvious organizational need for a new group? If so, then no you are not demoted. They are simply splitting up responsibilities above you. Is the organization growing rapidly? Then it is likely just that more layers need to be put into be able to effectively manage. This can be a plus or a minus, more layers and more people generally means more opportunity to move up in the organization but it often comes with more bureaucracy as well. Is your new boss well respected in the organization? If yes then you likely don't have a problem, If no then you and he have been shunted off to get you out of the way and it could be a very big red flag. Is it always best to report directly to top management - not likely unless you are very senior. As long as you are organizationally at the same level as your peers, there is not likely to be a problem due to organizational position. Junior people are expected to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. And nothing stops you from impressing the top person even if you don't directly report to him or her. Significant accomplishments that are known in the organization count for far more than who you report to (unless the person you report to is someone who has no organizational influence). 

First, nobody can demotivate you except yourself. You can choose to let his lack of praise bother you or you can choose not to. It is your reaction causing your problem. You can change your reaction. I've worked for people like this (In 40 years, I have worked for just about every type of boss there is). With someone like this you have to understand that silence is high praise. If he is not complaining abut something you did, then he likes it. Take that as praise. Next, use this a motivator to show him how much better you really are. Be so much better that he has to reward you or you get the reward elsewhere by getting a much better job. Letting your performance slip is cutting off your nose to spite your face. You want to show off accomplishments when you look for a new job as you almost certainly will. Living well (or in this case performing well) is your best revenge for a boss that doesn't care about you. Do great work and get a new job with a 60% pay raise because of how awesome you are and then go tell him that. I did that once and it felt great. try it, you will like it. Instead of talking to him about praise which he dislikes, discuss what you need to do to get a raise or a promotion. Some bosses who don't praise, never give raises and some do give monetary rewards when they feel they are deserved. So find out where he sets the bar for those things. If he can't tell you where he draws the line, then get yourself some stellar accomplishments and get a new job. Remember, think of your current performance as auditioning for the a better job. Never worry about getting a perfect annual review. I got one one year and the boss left the next year and my new boss was appalled that he had to explain to me that even though my performance was outstanding, it wasn't perfect and never had been, Luckily for him, he didn't know I had told the old boss the same thing when he gave me the perfect review. No one wants to have to maintain perfect performance either. We all make mistakes (although certainly some make fewer than others) and to have the expectation that you can never make a mistake without it downgrading your performance is an added stress. Perfect performance appraisals are not to be sought after. This isn't school where people get grades of 100%. 

First and formost, pay them at or above the market value for their professions. No one will ever identify with a company that is a wage thief. Next, value their input. That means listen to their concerns and take action on them. When people are telling you there is a problem and you don't listen, they shut down. Don't shoot the messenger. No one will tell you bad news if you blame them for bringing it up. Promote from within. If managers always come from outside, it is a bad sign. Don't micromanage. Give people some flexibility in how they do things. HR can't fix this problem by themselves, it is mostly a management problem when people are dis-engaged. 

You need to followup much more frequently. You need to micromanage people like this. Plan to sit with them all day for at least a week. Give them a task and watch them try to do it and then ask leading questions to help them figure out what to do. Under no circumstances touch the keyboard yourself. Let your boss know that you will not be making any progress on your other tasks until these people are straightened out. If they have not made significant progress after a week of sitting with them 100% of the time, then tell them they will have one more chance the next week before you recommend that the internship be terminated. For the person not showing up at all, I would recommend to your boss that he be terminated immediately. IF they are not able after 2 weeks of sitting with them and guiding them all the time, they are unteachable and the internship should be terminated and the college notified that they should not get credit for the internship. 

I agree totally with @TheWanderingDevMana with what has to happen soonest and for any future projects. However, I want to point out that in the meeting you should have spoken up and confronted the issue right then. By not speaking up, you agreed the code was production ready. You should have said, "I guess i was unclear, but this, this, and this still need to be done." It is critical to say it like this. You need to take responsiblity for the miscommunciation (even if you knew you communicated properly) so as to avoid embarassing your boss or confronting him with his incorrect interpretation. What you need to know is that bad news doesn't usually improve over time. You have to have the courage to bring it up as soon as you know about it. Right now the person who looks bad when this comes to light is you. Had you brought it up earlier, you are the one who saved two managers from embarrasment even if they aren't thrilled with the issue(s) themselves. How much worse is it going to be if they say deploy on Monday and then you tell then there is a month's worth of work left? When something is misinterpreted or is deliberately interpreted incorrectly, you have to address that at the time it happens or you become complicit and the blame will attach to you. Now that you have lost that moment, you need to follow up immediately with an email to both bosses stating your concerns about moving to prod and exactly what is holding you up. And by immediately, I mean it needs to be the very next thing you do at work. You are late communicating, you can't afford to be any later. 

You can't assume that the benefits are self-explanatory. You need to do as @JoeStrazzere suggested in the comments and detail the specific things you have learned that are useful for your specific job. In particular, detail what work-related problems that you found solutions for on Stack Overflow. If you can show that you spent less time solving problems by looking for them on Stack Overflow, then that would be a good thing as well. You also need to prove that you are not be behind in your work. No manager is going to support someone spending a lot of time on the Internet at any site, if the work is behind without specific proof that the time was spent researching the specific issue(s) that was(were) making your work delayed. Further, if your coworkers are solving their problems without spending hours on Stack Overflow, then it is best to bite the bullet and spend time here only when researching a specific issue. If you are learning new things that are not immediately useful, then I would suggest you do that in your off hours. 

First, social anxiety is treatable. You owe it to yourself to get treatment for it. In the meantime, you have corresponding with this person through email. Just tell her when she sets up the interview that you have anxiety issues. If you are more at ease after you get to know someone, then tell her that too. Can you talk to a camera? If so maybe set up the first interview over Skype. If that loses you the job, then that particular workplace won't be a good fit for you anyway if the issues are a bad as you seem to be saying. You need an understanding workplace and the best way to find one is to eliminate all the ones that aren't going to be understnding by telling them you have an issue. Be prepared to tell her what you are doing to fix the issue though if you bring it up, that is one reason why I told you to go get treatment first. Of course if you do this it will take you a long time to get a job, but it will take longer if you don't say anything and go to interviews and be unable to talk. At least if you have disclosed and they still want to interview you, then you know they are sympathetic to your problem. That should give you more confidence in the actual interview and you are likely to do better in those interviews than ones where you don't disclose. 

You don't have to lie, you simply do not tell them. You answer, "I'd rather not say." In general, it is not considered getting fired if you put in notice before they fire you. If they ask you to not come back after the day you get notice, they are simply changing the notice period. If they were thinking of firing you and had not done it yet, that is nobody's business. It is however best not to be in a position where you think you are going to get fired. Before you start your new job, you may need to do some soul searching about how you can do better in the new place. 

I have worked with some people through the years who have had inappropriate relationships at work that affected the people around them. It could be inappropriate displays of affection (no kissing, hugging or touching of any kind at work) or it could descend into worse with incompetent people being promoted due to the relationship or it could be that one person knew things from the person they were in a relationship with that they should not have known. I would never recommend any of those people for re-hire or for hire at a new place because they were unable to behave professionally not because they had a relationship. I have also worked with others who managed to behave professionally when they got into a relationship with a co-worker. Some of them are even married to that same co-worker now. I have no problem with them nor did any of the other people we worked with. Your problem isn't that you had "Friendship" with this man, it is that you behaved badly at work while it was going on. That makes you unreliable in your former boss's eyes. Likely there were some messes caused by this that she had to clean up. Alternatively, the boss was jealous and feels threatened by your relationship to this person. Even there, there is no going back. You aren't going to change this person's mind. You don't get a do-over for this type of mistake. You are not ever going to be hired back by that organization until the manager is long gone and maybe not then depending on how your personnel file is marked. You need to move on to other opportunities and you need to think very clearly about why your relationship caused a problem and how you are going to handle it the next time you are attracted to someone at work. 

I had to bring in fingerless gloves. Having my hands be warm made a huge difference. You can take them off when you leave the desk to still have the business casual appearance. 

HAve you tried asking the operations staff your domain knowledge questions? If you talk to them politely and with respect, they are highly likely to be helpful to you especially when the other devlopers are treating them as badly as you describe. 

My rule of thumb is that if the roles are closely related, they get one entry. This would be when you move from developer to senior developer for instance. If the roles are very different with different duties, I list them separately. If the job was some time ago and the experience isn't all that important anyway, you could combine them. If it was more than ten years ago you could just eliminate it. To list them combined, I would do something like XYZ corp - Senior developer (2009-present), developer (2006-2009) - then list the duties 

If you want that promotion then you need to do one thing. Get the team on your side. As long as the team opposes you, then you are unqualified to be their lead and promoting you would be a disaster for the team because they will resist everything you do and increase their efforts to look bad. This is especially true if you are appointed to the lead position without the chance for any of them to compete for it and make their own case as to why they should get it. They will resent that you got a promotion many of them would have wanted without a fair shot at it. So you start out being lead with a team that resents you for multiple reasons. There is little chance of a good outcome. So first you need to learn the people skills to get people to want to work with you. You need to read books like How to Win Friends and Influence People and put the techniques to practice. You need to read other books on how to deal with difficult people to see how you can help them learn to do the things they needs to do. Some training on mentoring and coaching would work too. Above all you need to learn how to present your technical choices in a way that sells people on why you want to do it that way and you need to listen to their ideas and incorporate them with your ideas.
