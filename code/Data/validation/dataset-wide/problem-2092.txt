Until the knowledge transfer to your replacement is complete, you are in part responsible for activities under the project. Since your manager has honored your request to be replaced, you should be going above and beyond to make sure the transition is smooth. Understand that your manager's overwhelming interest is the client's satisfaction, which should be your goal as well. Sometimes this means taking over when a colleague is incapable. I would recommend that you chalk this up as a lesson learned, and try your best to keep the client's interest as top priority. Don't let your manager think that you aren't the right person for your new assignment. 

Proceed as if there were no breach in confidence. You can request that your boss not forward your email, but receipt of email is not a contract, and your boss is under no obligation to honor your request. The number one rule of email (and probably anything written down as well) is that you must only write things that you want the entire world to see, because that is a potential side-effect (see Sony Pictures Entertainment). Do not quit on the spot. You will have no leverage when looking for another job. Start looking for another job immediately so that you have options if the time comes to resign. Schedule a meeting with your boss to discuss your issues, but try to be diplomatic, and try to understand things from your boss' point of view. 

Things change for the worse all the time. Giving notice only when you have to is a kind of insurance against financial disaster. Could the training be beneficial to you in the future? As an employee in good standing, you have in a sense earned the right to this training, based on your previous effort. It's a cost of doing business to train employees who will not stay with the company. It's rare to stay in one job your entire career, so it's expected that some who are trained will in fact move on. 

From your description, it sounds like the interview was ended abruptly, so I'm not sure this situation could have been avoided, or that you should have done anything differently. Perhaps you could have asked if they had a time limit on the interview. If they let you know that up front, you may have been able to manage the time a little better, and get your questions in before the interview was over. But most of the time, as you point out, the interviewer tries to leave sufficient time for questions. When I am interviewing candidates, and I'm running short on time, I cut my own questions short, to make sure I address any outstanding questions the candidate might have. 

It is not better to be forthcoming now. As you suspect, there is a distinct possibility you won't be asked to return to work. One of the advantages of a short notice period is the flexibility it provides. Anything can happen in the next three weeks, and it's possible you could change your mind about leaving. Resignation is a business decision, not personal. You are under no obligation to make things more convenient than required for your employer. Rest assured your company would feel no mutual obligation to make things easier for you. Enjoy your wedding, take your time off, and make your decision when you get back. 

Think about it this way -- if you were suddenly fired from your current position, would you contact the recruiter for assistance and a possible employment opportunity? If your answer is yes, then you aren't wasting the recruiter's time. This is a recruiter's job -- staying in touch with as many qualified people as possible to be there when the timing is right. A few minutes every few months isn't really much of an investment from either side. If recruiters feel you are wasting their time, they will simply not contact you. I would not consider it rude or inappropriate to stay in touch. 

In each of these cases there's no set timeline when/if any of these might be resolved. So continuing to contact them is fine, but I would not expect a guaranteed resolution any time soon. 

If you're talking about a physical library, I would say no unless you have the time, money, and staff to keep it current. We have a library that is woefully out of date because it's largely been replaced with online resources. Personally I would invest in company subscriptions to training/books sites such as Pluralsight, Lynda, or Safari Books Online. My evidence is only anecdotal, but access to training resources like these are considered highly valuable and sought after by employees. 

This is completely normal, but not well known because of the taboo surrounding salary discussions, at least in the US. You always have an opportunity to discuss requirements, but it comes at the price of perhaps having to leave if your requirements are not met. Truth is there's no inherent fairness in how pay is distributed -- it's a combination of how well you sell yourself, how skilled of a negotiator you are, and how valuable your given skills are to your employer at the time you are hired. You can certainly ask for a salary review and increase, but you have less leverage as a current employee versus a new hire. At the same time, you'll need to have reasons why you are worth being paid more -- simply comparing yourself to another employee will not convince your employer. You can certainly call attention to the things you do better than your co-worker, but you'll have to do that without making a direct reference to another person's abilities. 

It is reasonable and customary for companies to reimburse smaller expenses (e.g., lodging and food for business travel) that are variable. Core infrastructure costs such as office space and utilities, even in a startup, should be handled by the CEO or co-founders. This is especially true for cost commitments, such as a lease, where you are required to pay several months or more. As an employee, and not a CEO or co-founder, you will not share in the benefit of making investments in fixed costs of the company. You will only bear risk. And the more risk the CEO or founders can transfer, the better it is for them. I would tell your CEO that you would be happy to make the arrangements, but require a company account for billing, since you cannot afford to make payments yourself. Another possibility is to ask for reimbursement in advance, so you only pay for the expense once you actually have the money to do so. 

It's quite common as an employee to be asked to perform a task one doesn't want to do. Sometimes the best course of action is to accept the responsibility, and get it over with quickly. It's also not unheard of for managers to take the course of least resistance when assigning work -- give the mundane tasks to the person who is most junior, or one who is unlikely to say no, even if that person is very busy already. In those situations you have to be creative and positive. Give constructive reasons why you are not the best person for the task. Talk with others to see who might want to trade work with you. You may not get out of the work, but you'll certainly get farther than if you resort to telling your superiors where they can go, and what they can do when they get there. 

It's not at all unusual for the HR department and the people who the interviews to work in completely separate silos. Often HR has no interest in the process until someone is actually hired. Perhaps if your interviewees are not communicating this to HR, you might be able to do so yourself. When you are interviewed for the first time, or even prior to the interview, ask for the appropriate HR contact who deals with hiring issues. If asked why, you can simply state your concerns as you have done in other interviews, and want to confirm there would be no policy barriers to prevent you from working there. 

It's a good instinct that you want to complete your contract as you promised, and a longer first job will likely look better on your resume. A job search, as you've experienced yourself, can take a long time -- you should start a "soft search" now, doing research, networking with people you know, and contacting recruiters. Don't assume that you can wait 6 months and suddenly kick into high gear. For now, you have the luxury of looking around for options while still employed. If your gut is telling you you're on an informal PIP, then you probably are, or you should act as if you are. As you do your search, keep in the back of your mind that your employment can end at any time (I'm assuming your employment is at-will), and that you may need to convert job leads to a job offer quickly. If you're presented with interviews/offers, I would lean towards taking an offer, even if it's before the end of the contract. Trying to find a job when unemployed is a far more difficult task, and leaves you with very little leverage in negotiations. Having one short job on your resume will not be harmful -- it's when you have a series of short-duration employment positions that it starts to work against you. 

Recruiter performance is often measured by the number of contacts and hires -- by submitting to multiple people within the organization you may create confusion for them internally. I would submit to one initially -- if you do not receive a timely response, then send to another. Good recruiters will follow up with you as soon as they can, since it's kind of what they do. 

Never a bad idea to be prepared for any questions about your length of stay in any one job. Employers are typically more interested in why you are thinking of leaving your job -- good answers include:
