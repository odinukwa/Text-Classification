I disagree with most of the comments/answers to the OP. Aside from the obvious (already pointed out) that someone coming to you isn't the same situation as you in a meeting with some (unspecified) number of people, and the just as obvious comment that each situation is unique, being modest is useless. I've got 2 pat replies to someone calling me an expert: "An expert is someone who knows more than anyone else in the room on the subject" and "An expert is someone who you can call that is at least 500 miles away from you and who charges at least $500/hr." It's also obvious that no one can know everything about anything, so perhaps "specialist" or "student" are both as accurate as "expert", I'd hope. Probably my largest failure as a technical expert is my weak ability to ask the right questions. I am pretty good at listening, but not so good at cutting through the fog to the kernel. You need to understand the question in order to answer it effectively. You're not clear about whether your issue is with getting button-holed for ad-hoc, off the cuff solutions to complex problems, or it's having meetings fail to get to a conclusion. Big difference. So, another key thing you must identify is what exactly your goals should be. As you seem to realize, providing "the" answer is a very long way from having the correct solution implemented. It doesn't much help to say that the seals will likely fail at launch temperatures, if the decision makers are either not in the room, or aren't willing to listen. Buy-in is essential. To get that, you can't be part of the background. The best solutions I have created are ones that are arrived at without me. I want them to own it, not me. It's a life-long (or at least career-long) process of learning all of the various ways to foster change. And a solution is a change. Identification of decision makers, stake holders, competitive interests, side-effects (intentional and unintentional), are all complex social skills. They say "follow the money" but in reality, the economics is just one facet of it. There's also power/influence as well as appearances. It isn't form or function, it is form and function. So, I guess there are three or four different scenarios. 1. Button-holed with simple question - solution is simple answer ("1+1 = 2")(note that repeating the question back (as YOU understand it) prior to answering it should be second nature. 2. Button-holed with complex question - solution is to tell them that it's too complex and without more information and time, there's a good likelihood that you'll be giving bad advice. Offer them alternatives (schedule additional time, set up a meeting, etc.) Note that advice you give will effect your and your groups reputation, so be careful. Sometimes people just want a "common" solution, so again asking the right questions (about motives, scope) is important. 3. Small meeting, decision makers present. 4. Large meeting, general audience. The goals of each of those ought to be different, so the way you act is also going to be different. One KEY thing you didn't mention is whether or not you are chairing the meeting. I assume you aren't. But there's plenty that's been written on how to chair an effective meeting that everyone who goes to more than a few meetings a year ought to know. (Like for instance how to effectively shut down (quell) someone who is hogging the conversation, and how to make sure everyone in the meeting has a chance to be heard). Did you hear about the time a GE electric turbine broke down in Oregon? They called GE in NY and an expert flew out (charging $1000/hr INCLUDING travel time!) came into the power station, walked up to the turbine, pulled a hammer out of his bag and whacked the turbine once. The Head Engineer turned bright red and said:"We're paying you $30,000 to hit the f^%^ing thing with a hammer??" To which the expert replied:"No, you're paying me $30,000 because I know where to hit it." 

I am updating my resume, and am debating putting the fundraising run I did back in the spring on as Volunteer Experience. I had raised some money for a cause and did the run, would this be something worth adding to a resume? 

EDIT: djohnson has already mentioned what I've said below about the away status but I'll say it anyways to re-iterate. If you don't want to set up a new account, you could set your status to being 'Away' and write "At the office" in your personal message so your friends know not to bother you during that time. Also explain to your boss that he can still message you whilst you're on Away status and you'll specifically let him know if you're going to actually be away from your messenger, in a meeting for example. Also, why do you have people on your list that you don't want to talk to anymore? You should remove these people from your list so they're not an issue for you. 

I will be applying for an open position within my company, this position is looking mostly for external candidates. Last time I applied and was interviewed for the position, the interview was understandably geared more towards external candidates. This time around I have an idea of making a Power Point presentation outlining to my boss (and possibly one of the executives if they're in the interview as well), why they should promote me into the position rather than look externally for someone. I know it's highly unorthodox to do something like that in an interview, and I feel like it would answer a lot of questions they would be asking me anyways, plus would highlight why looking externally isn't as great of an idea as they think. I also feel like it will just be geared towards external candidates again and there won't be a whole lot my boss can ask me anyways. Would a Power Point be too out there? Or should I just stick to the 'traditional' format of an interview and just answer what questions I can? 

The only way I could see you negotiating for more would be after you're working in the job for several months to a year, but only if there's proper justification for it and assuming your probation period is done. Doing this during your probation period will likely just end with them showing you the door. For example, you approach your boss after 6-12 months of working at said job and make your case for a higher wage. This doesn't of course mean that you will get your higher wage, and very well could mean your boss says no. But when making your case bring up your work ethic, any special skills you have compared to other employees (additional programming languages you know that may help the company), something you've done for the company to save them money/make customers happier, etc. It also unfortunately depends on how your boss feels about you, if they disagree with your work ethic for example, and see you as a lazy employee they're less likely to give you a raise, or ask their boss(es) to give you one. If you have good rapport with your boss, it's more likely that they'll entertain the idea at the very least. Anything you can say that would reflect why you should get a 5k pay increase. TLDR; Ask boss about pay raise after having the job for 6-12 months, or more. 

Things change, and businesses will usually understand. If they value you, they will work in collaboration with you, i.e. finding a mutual agreement. However going down the technical route of not accepting hours, is a sure fire way to sour a relationship. Just because it's business doesn't mean morals are thrown out of the window, be honest and explain the situation, by the sounds of things it's out of your control rather than your lack of planning and therefore isn't unprofessional. 

Coming from a male dominated industry and having to deal with, 'banter' I get your situation. I always find challenging one person publicly will work, but you can do this indirectly. If someone says, X is better looking than you, or tries to smell your hair challenge them by saying, 'excuse me' (do this with an assertive tone) then put the enthuses on this by saying, do you think that's acceptable. This one person in this situation will back down, either that or will have to start an argument with you. Argument - don't retaliate, once he has started this just take the, 'i'm not arguing with you about this, if you have a problem I suggest you speak to the manager, however I feel it's unacceptable for you to act like this.' approach. continued banter - (i.e. calm down, I was only joking..) Carry on with the assertive tone, but he's got the point so lead with something like, 'I am calm, I just don't appreciate X) then move swiftly on with your work. Backs down - If he backs down carry on as normal :) The reality is, if you don't challenge the situation it will continue to get worse and people will think this is normal behaviour and is acceptable. 

I don't think that I completely agree with the above answers, learning something new shouldn't been seen passively by your employer at all. Personal and business progression should be a part of everyones careers it helps keep colleagues engaged, happy and satisfied colleagues not learning or progressing usually end up frustrated, much like you sound. In your career if you find yourself in a dead end job, i.e. no room for personal or professional development you should start to look at businesses that value employee growth. Just my thoughts though.. 

Short and sweet answer. Speak to your manager/hr and explain you would like the opportunity to learn more and carry on progressing but feel as if the courses wouldn't offer you much more insight. Then ask for their suggestions. 

Only if it compliments your teaching, i.e. I have recently been enrolled in a master's degree program in my field to help gain a deeper understanding to compliment my ability to teach X If it's irrelevant to your current role, i'd as an employer question your motives for doing this, and be concerned about your long term career within that institution along with you commitment to the role over your personal education 

I don't know how to go about doing this. About a month and a half ago we were asked what role we wanted within the company, I'm a developer and I chose Professional Services since up to this point that's basically what I've been doing is coding custom pages for clients, custom implementations, etc. I love it, it's what I went to school for, everything about coding is great (which is basically all they do over on the Research and Dev side of the company). I was also specifically told that I would still be a developer on the PS side of the company. Over the last couple of weeks I've been getting more and more support tickets coming my way as they wean one of the R & D guys off of support, I'll be the one that has to do client upgrades etc from what I've been told as well. It seems like my role is turning more from "Programmer/Analyst" to "Tier Two Support Analyst". This isn't what I want, I feel like I was sort of mislead (albeit not intentionally) or misunderstood what exactly my role would be. I was let go from my previous job, which was entirely support, because my support there was lacking, I'm really not suited to support. I don't want support to be jeopardizing my job with this company either, I am much better suited to coding. We're currently interviewing people to fill roles on both sides of the fence (R&D and PS), is there a way I can go about asking the management about them switching me over to R&D? I feel like it would disrupt some of their interview process by doing this however, what's the right way to go about this without stepping on too many toes? So to speak. 

As stated in the title, one of my coworkers is rarely in the office due to medical reasons. They do sometimes log on from home if they're feeling up to it, but their actual time spent in the office itself is maybe a third of the year. This coworker is also one of our support staff, and thus is somewhat important and it affects everyone else when he's absent. I can tell my manager is getting sick and tired of the situation and I know that firing this guy would be a slippery slope due to his condition. Is there potentially a reason in which this guy could be let go without it turning into a legal matter? I ask because it seems like a lot of my other coworkers are getting tired of this as well. But I realize this isn't really my business and is something my manager will have to take care of. My question is out of curiousity.
