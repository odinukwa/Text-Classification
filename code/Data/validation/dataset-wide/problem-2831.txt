You don't know that an axiom is true, you just accept it as if it was true. People will take the axiom, and other axioms, and logical rules, and make deductions. You then look at the deductions. If the deductions result in contradictions then your axioms are not well chosen. For example, in mathematics there is the axiom "for any two real numbers a and b, exactly one of the statements a < b, a = b, or a > b is true". If we replaced this with "for any two real numbers a and b, exactly two of the statements a < b, a = b, or a > b are true", then we would eventually end up deductions producing contradictions. Again in mathematics, we know that there are statements that can neither be proven to be correct nor can they be proven to be wrong. If you have such a statement S, you can take as an axiom. We get a slightly different mathematics. We could have taken (not S) as an axiom, and again get a different mathematics. So in this case, any one out of two contradicting statements can be taken as an axiom. 

A to B: "You are a bad husband because you cheat on your wife". B to A: "You also cheat on yor wife". This doesn't refute the claim "B is a bad husband", that's the "tu quoque" (you the same) fallacy. But it nicely refutes A's unspoken claim that A is a better husband than B. There is another possibility: A to B: "You are a bad mother because you allow your children to dring coke". B to A: "You also allow your children to drink coke". Here the real argument may be: "You do it as well, and you wouldn't be doing it if it made one a bad mother, so this isn't an argument to show I'm a bad mother". Now look at this: "You are taking drugs; that's bad". "Everyone I know is taking drugs". This is an attempt to claim that taking drugs can't be that bad, because everybody does it (or better, all aquaintances of that person do it). In that case, many people doing something that is bad for them doesn't make it any better. 

You get an ad hominem fallacy, if person X makes a claim, and you try to say that the claim must be false because X has some fault. Kony didn't make any claims, and nobody tries to discredit his claims. Shakespeare didn't make any claims and nobody tries to discredit his claims. Therefore no ad hominem fallacy. Now if Kony made the claim that he loves children and elephants, we would still have no ad hominem fallacy, because the attack against his character directly implies that he is lying. But if he claimed that the earth circles around the sun, then saying "this must be false because he is an evil man" is an ad hominem fallacy. (If he said the sun circles around the earth, it would also be an ad hominem fallacy. It doesn't matter for the fallacy whether the claimed fact is true or false). The fact that Kony is evil as claimed doesn't make his arguments true or false. If he said "2 plus 2 is 4", claiming this is false because he is evil would make you look stupid. If the pope said "2 plus 2 is 5", claiming this is true because he has a good character would make you look equally stupid. 

Geometry is a part of mathematics. It starts with axioms, draws conclusions from them, and so on. "Alternative geometries" has nothing much to do with it being part of mathematics; people had used a set of axioms that they believed to be sufficient and it turned out not to be, and it turned out that adding any one of three possible additional axioms would produce one distinct mathematical geometry out of three possible ones. On the other hand, practical geometry can be seen as either engineering or as science. There are many aspects that have nothing to do with mathematical geometry. For example, building precise instruments, how these instruments are affected by temperature, atmosphere pressure and humidity along a line that is measured, effects of the earth's curvature and of relativity. For example, when you determine the location of points precisely using measurements in geometry, it all starts working fine just in agreement with mathematical geometry, but then you measure more precisely and the results disagree because (1) the earth is not flat but a ball, (2) because it is not a ball but a rotational ellipsoid, (3) because it is not a rotational ellipsoid but a flattened rotational ellipsoid, (4) because it is not a flattened rotational ellipsoid but a deformed flattened rotational ellipsoid. And then you take into account relativity... So practical geometry is very much a science. 

It's asking the wrong question. Ethics is hard. It's very hard even for highly intelligent people with a generous amount of natural intelligence. And it's not something that you can "program into" a machine. Your only chance to create a truly ethical artificial intelligence is to make it intelligent enough to learn about ethics, and then to teach it. The alternative is an artificial intelligence with goals. You give the machines goals, and you give it the intelligence to try to achieve these goals. And setting the goals, you then try to set goals that tend to produce results similar to those that ethical behaviour would create. 

I wouldn't even try to translate it, because it is grammatically unclear, and the meaning of the word "they" is unclear, so I wouldn't think I can make any reasonable assumption what it is supposed to mean. Two reasonable ways to clarify: "Some philosophers love all those philosophers who love themselves, but not those who don't love themselves" and "Some philosophers love all philosophers, but any philosopher can only love all philosophers if that particular philosopher loves himself or herself". 

Let's say we found out that the speed of light changes, most likely very slowly. That wouldn't mean that any existing laws of physics change. It would mean that our assumptions what the laws of physics are ("the speed of light is constant") were wrong in this case, and that the correct law would have been "the speed of light changes slowly over time". 

I took an empty sheet of paper, wrote your statements on each side, and the earth didn't stand still, no angry god come down to earth and destroyed the paper, nothing happened. So it's not a bad deal. I can make four different statement now of the form "the statement on the front of the paper is true/false, and the statement on the back is true/false". Of these four different statements, two are consistent with what is written on the paper: "the statement on the front of the paper is true, and the statement on the back is false" and "the statement on the front of the paper is false, and the statement on the back is true". Mockingbird: I don't get what you don't get. First, you call it a paradox, I call it two sentences written on a sheet of paper. That means there is no big problem to solve here. It's nothing to worry about. Second, there are two statements, each could be true or false, making four combinations. Two of these four combinations are consistent with what is written. This is different from the standard liar paradox, where "the liar's statement is true" and "the liar's statement is false" are both inconsistent with the liar's statement. So we don't actually have a paradox at all - we know definitely that one statement is true and one is false, we just cannot say which one. 

It's a bit cowardly or sitting on the fence, but it isn't very wrong. In the situation described, your action or inaction will lead to one dead person or five dead persons. We all know that one path is the right one, and the other one is wrong. Unfortunately, there is universal disagreement which one is the right one and which one is the wrong one. Do you think that by thinking about the problem you will have a better than 50% chance of making the right decision? Maybe you will, but maybe you are bad at making that kind of decisions, and are highly likely to get it wrong. By throwing a coin, you ensure a fifty percent chance that the right choice is made. PS. The point of this answer is that sometimes problems are difficult, so what about throwing a coin instead of trying to find the best decision? That's independent of the actual problem.
