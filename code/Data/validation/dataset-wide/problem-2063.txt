edit: I've decided that a summary/profile is better then? I want to get out of the gaming industry and move into something more low-key. Is this effective? How would you change it? Do I need to explain why I want to leave gaming? I have a Skills Summary just below this 'profile' section. 

too many meetings like 5 hrs a week are getting in the way of me doing much new to ReactJS and the concept of it colleagues and boss didn't provide much guidance or anything about what is expected of me and where everything is the code base is a complete mess that requires a lot of re-factoring and I feel uncomfortable doing this/takes a long time as I am new to ReactJS because my tasks take a while to do because I'm new to the job and no expectations for speed were communicated to me I feel very uncomfortable the lead developer is kind of rude and curt sometimes 

I quit my old job because my boss was bullying me so I got this new one doing web development with ReactJS. While my new boss and colleagues are a lot nicer and friendlier, the nature of the job and project are really stressing me out and I want to quit already. 

I feel very stressed out and under a lot of pressure. What could I do to improve the situation? I would like to feel more competent and comfortable in the new technology. 

To evaluate that you need a lot more than "only" the salary. Does your boss now really underpay or are "surprises" in the new job that could explain the higher salary? More worktime? A company that expects 1 h per day overtime of course can pay more than anotherone. What do you know about the new job? Conditions, expectations...? Will you like it as you like the current job? What about the team, the company culture in general? Calculate what is left from the other salary, after taxes and eventually more commuting and all the rest. Then confront the pros and cons. 

Since WANTING to do that is important to keep everybody happy, you shouldn't select those people by rank. 

See the first comment to your question, the answer may depend on the region you are. Apart from that, what should be not acceptable? The situation you describe is underpaid and overworked. If it really is, can you state a reason why you would like to stay there? Except your attitide towards work which is laudable! But there is not only the company, you are there too! If the question is only about how to quit, then quit in a way that noone can tell you had left a mess behind you. Don't quit right now, leave a little time so you can clean up your stuff. You can mention that at your next employer. 

I went on an international vacation for 2 weeks. I went from Canada to the UK. 3 days in I came down with a horrible flu. My flight home is in a couple of days but this flu is still holding strong and I feel wretched. I doubt I'll be good for my first day back to work. How would you tell the manager since asking for sick days right after the vacation looks bad? Would you just request to work from home until recovered? I work from home 2 days per week anyways. I've no choice but to go back to work since I won't have enough money survive longer or buy new tickets. 

I hate my current job so much that it makes me physically sick. I've been there 2.5 years and on top of harassment I'm just not learning or growing. I have to quit because it's affecting my whole life. It was my first job out of university. Anyways, the tricky part is that my husband and I want to relocate in about one year as we don't currently have the funds to do so. We want to move closer to family. We hate where we currently live and it's wearing on us both. He's made up his mind that we'll go in a year with no exceptions. I've had an interview and it looks promising. It's much higher pay and a better company. I could try to transfer once I'm in as they have a branch near where we want to move but that might not work out. How can I minimize the impact this would have on my future career prospects? It doesn't look like I'd get a good reference from either places with my situation. Perhaps as a software developer who hasn't committed to being an expert in anything yet this won't be such a hit? 

It makes other employees scared to resign and shows that company doesn't trust their morality. It is also a bad idea, culturally. Coming from Europe I'd say that you can do this differently, we do this differently, and all the terrible risks and obvious reasons enumerated in existing answers don't apply. This is because they only exist in your brains and not your world. They are errors in your judgement. A company in financial sector. Some employees of IT dept resigned trough the history, who could technically: steal credit card numbers, introduce back doors, install subtle bombs that would fire in future. And who could with just a little bit of thinking devise how to do it anonymously (I said it already: IT). They worked 3 full months after resignation. They didn't particularly like to work these 3 months and stated it plainly, but they were legally obliged to do so. They didn't even like the company. The company could have legally walked them out on day 0, but the decision was to keep them. The bad stuff never happened. And they fixed some stuff during the time, cleaned some of 'their' mess, did some knowledge transfer. It was more than one occasion. Go figure. Employees actually have some morality. They don't go around harming others just because they see no immediate penalty. I think that after 3 months if they found on a sidewalk a wallet of their CEO, they would return it. Their managers trust in that morality. And the upper manager knows that they can trust the lower manager's judgement. The owners know they can trust the upper management. A magical chain of trust. It's bad I believe that other answers, maybe because of the immersion, didn't see what is obvious to me. If you (a person) hire yourself a janitor, and interact with him for years, and as he says he would like to resign the next minute you send guards to escort him? Really...? Because your stuff is so precious? Unacceptable risk, huge liability? A minute before it was acceptable, now it's not? Nevermind how long is the list of your stated reasons and justifications, the action brings a clear message about the employer. It shows how employer treats others, how much trust they have with morality, what you could expect of employer's own morality. (Update) Cause If you see a company that experiences this, and want to find the cause you ask a simple question: "what needs to change before this company can keep employees after resignation?" If you address all the stated reasons one by one, and somehow magically exclude them all (the risk that an employee would reduce staff morale, poach customers, sabotage, etc) I won't expect the situation to change. I expect they would still have been escorted out and I expect the enumeration of reasons would get new entries. So these are not actual cause: they don't influence reality. If you re-create the trust in human morality, I expect things to change. This is because you nailed the true cause, not just a stated reason. Now, how it is repaired, is there a recipe to change a mistrusting company, I honestly don't know. 

The software company I work for often hires junior developers when there is a lot if testing to be done and there is time/room for them to get up to speed. however the senior developers get extremely irritated when asked 'easy' questions that might be googled. Well not everyone wants to use google as their main source. They are horrified that the juniors didn't learn it in school but it wasn't a job requirement and the juniors didn't put it on their resume so I feel like they don't have the right to get so angry. They even expressed their disgust and annoyance in the team meeting. I find this behaviour to be horrid. How would you deal with it? 

I feel very distanced from my colleagues. I'm not sure if it's just this company or all software places so I am seeking your opinion. Also, I think it gets in the way of productivity because no one wants to mentor or share knowledge and that's not really my style. I like sharing knowledge. I work as a game programmer at a small company. When I first started it was just 4 very senior guys in a room and they did not talk to each other or eat lunch together. They set the tone for a silent and disconnected atmosphere. I can understand as they were working on separate projects. I was just out of university and started as a tester. They also gave me an old legacy game to convert and I had no clue what I was doing as I had never made a game before in my life and they were very very rude to me about my 'newbie' questions. That created even more distance than there already was because the manager hired me because there was room to grow into the role. The fact that I'm female doesn't help either. As time went on nothing really changed. I got married and didn't tell them - why would I don't think they would care. I also got pregnant and didn't tell them because a) was afraid of discrimination b) I didn't think they would care (a bunch of young unmarried guys). Also, they can be very judgmental. When I did share some of my personal life like I haven't traveled much in my life they looked down on me. The company grew and they took on more people. When I came back from mat leave they hired even more people but the culture didn't change. The new project manager said some border-lining sexist comments to me about why I'm not home with the baby. He appears to be small-minded and power-hungry. Because of this I am closed off even more to the point where I avoid taking lunch at the same time as anyone else and try my best to avoid any non-work conversation topics at all costs. I'm a very shy, quiet, geeky girl who finds any non-standard/'politically-correct' dialog or confrontation in a work environment to be extremely inappropriate. Is it normal for colleagues to be so closed off from each other? Is a non-game software environment any different? I don't think this place will ever change so what are some things to ask in the next job interview? 

My first thought was what's wrong in a company that needs to promote itself among people who work there. For the next project you might want to see if this is just a gift or there is something burried inside that could be solved better. Your CEO's argument could be wasn't it predictable that if everyone brings this lunchbox then all the same lunchboxes are all over? Don't tell them you had no idea this happens. They will doubt if you were the right one for this job. Say yes you had a clue that more than one identical lunchbox could be found in the fridge. But (shape this phrase to make it fit) in case your company is not the local kindergarten I assume you have to deal with adult people. Shouldn't the 2nd or 3rd person who puts a lunchbox in the fridge see there already are others looking the same and put her/his name on his/her box without getting this advice from the management? Let's think further, shouldn't people put their name on by default, even if they all look different? Shouldn't someone who finds multiple boxes or unknown food in his box try to examine which is his and which is not instead of just eat the first thing they grabbed? Don't let them make you responsible for their lack of social skills. You tried to do good and it's not your fault if (again, rephrase this) they are too stupid. For the next project try to ask around who might see any problems like that. Involve CEO, at least send them your suggestion and ask about their opinion. 

I'm a relatively-junior dev being out of university for 2.5 years. I've been working at a start-up game dev company and it's not working out. I just don't fit in at all. You can see my other posts to read about this. Here is what I'm looking for: 

I currently work as a game programmer at a startup company in a big city. I took the job out of desperation. I really hate living in a big city and would like to live in a smaller community of 300k people or less. When you approach 1 million residents you get more jobs but it's not really suitable for raising a family or making close friends with ease. It's also impossible to buy a house. 100k and less and it's still quite a small town. I also hate commuting - it's very difficult to commute when you have small children at home. I also find the gaming industry to be too intense for me - I like to have days and periods of time where it's not as extreme and I'm not scrambling to get things done all the time. Which kind of development would you suggest for my preferences? When I look there are jobs in the smaller communities but are they also going to be as picky because they have less people to chose from? Would you suggest just scoping out places that are more suitable for living and then check what the companies are doing there? Does anyone have experience with my situation? I don't necessarily want to stay in game development either. I have only been out of university for 2 years so I'm pretty green. 

You've stalled them. You never say how long you intend to think, and you don't promise you will actively get back to them to continue the conversation. Flat intonation means the pitch (frequency) of the sound you make should change as little as possible through out the sentence. My second approach. Say what you are currently doing, addressing as much yourself as them. Your tone shouldn't indicate you are responding to their question, you are simply friendly communicating your own actions. 

There is no obvious objective "right or wrong" here. Ultimately, any ticketing system aims at turning the unpredictable&unstructured human interaction to resemble a boring machine-to-machine interaction; it shows a staff as a machine, and to the staff the requests also look like a steady factory line. Your manager wants to strengthen this factory line abstraction; you don't. He wants keep the content as close to the (did I mention boring) facts as possible; you don't. In my opinion you're right and he's wrong. Others have their own opinions. What really matters is that you are not a slave. You are free to use your judgement in major things as well as in such minor things. I know I go against the standard Workplace.SE way, but sometimes you don't do as your told and it can harm your career only a tiny little bit. But you need to weigh the risk and try to predict the management response. If you proceed with good-karma-stupid-nice-smile way, your boss could go bonkers and turn this into a horrible ego trip. Another boss would just point the thing out twice more and then say to themselves "what a moron, well, I've seen worse, whatever". Another boss would just find some light punishment (like "so, mister nice guy now always gets tickets from our wonderful top priority customer XYZ") and forget about it altogether. Experienced managers more often than not are used to really serious discipline issues; they just don't let everyone to see it. Your problem is not so serious. I guess it's up to you to risk this tradeoff.
