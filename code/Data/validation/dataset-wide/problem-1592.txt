I think the original idea (burying the homes of 370,000 people to build an infeasible large structure, in order to ski and train for cycling) is ludicrous, but it was a joke. Ha ha. I like jokes. No problems. However, the claim that this idea is being taken seriously is also ludicrous - and yet is being reported as news. I would like to know if there has been any serious attempt to consider this proposal: e.g. a funded feasibility study or environmental impact study, the forming of a committee in a local government - basically anything more than a bunch of engineers and quantity surveyors drawing doodles and spreadsheets on napkins over a few beers. Alternatively, have there been any retractions from AFP or evidence that Zonneveld likes to play practical jokes on the media? I fear this is a bit of a silly question - but if I am right, I don't like it when nonsense like goes unchallenged in newspapers across the world. If I am wrong, this is an amazing story and I want to know. 

There is plenty of people trying ad hoc experiments about what happens to phones put in a microwave: 

In this study they were attempting to compare the digestibility of several proteins in humans and rats. We are only interested here in gluten and humans. Here's an extract from Table 4. 

Bishnu Shrestha's story seems to have undergone some embellishments in the re-telling, but the underlying accounts were considered veracious enough for several medals and honours to be awarded. Some notes: 

Parkes was an Australian statesman whose career spanned the last half of the 1800s. I found it odd that the word "secular" could be used this way 150 years ago, and checked its etymology. 

They looked at three types of alcohol safety laws, including "administrative license revocation laws", and concluded: 

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of vitamin B complex in the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps in elderly patients with hypertension. Chan P, Huang TY, Chen YJ, Huang WP, Liu YC SOJ Clin Pharmacol. 1998;38(12):1151 

There is certainly a lot of people claiming it to be true, including various dentists. On their web-site, Colgate make the claim, quoting the American Dentists Association in 2006. Visiting the ADA web-site, the closest I found was the claim appearing in some unreferenced teaching materials. But what scientific evidence is there? I only did a quick literature search, and what I found was less than convincing. One article in an industry journal made the claim: 

Warning: The abstract does not detail the size of the sample, except noting it was a subgroup of the main experiment. But, we are talking about the human body, so it is more complicated than that. If you want to lose weight by increasing your energy expenditure, exercise is a major factor. If you want to exercise for long periods, ensuring you aren't dehydrated is a major factor. Which brings us to another effect of water temperature. 

Anti-Semitic sites, such as Stormfront, use data like this to conclude that there is a Jewish conspiracy. This is not a safe assumption, due to a large number of potential confounding factors (ignoring the innate difficulty/impossibility of having a conspiracy of that size.) 

The researcher quoted in that page is Sandeep Salvi, director of the Chest Research Foundation. He was one of the authors of a paper that was presented at the National Pulmonary Congress, 2004, Ahmedabad. (Note: I assume that means it was not peer-reviewed.) 

You would be flabbergasted. This fruit-cake claim is riddled with errors. So is the original claim. Unclear Term What does "preserve the recipe" mean? Does it mean keep the recipe unaltered? Does it mean ensuring the recipe exists in the future? Does it mean ensuring the recipe grows in popularity? Does it mean ensuring the popularity remains the same? If it means keeping the recipe unaltered, then the act of altering it clearly doesn't preserve the recipe. Likewise, if "preserve the species" means keeping the relative distribution of genes in the gene pool the same, introducing a genetic change doesn't preserve the species. [No references. I'm arguing about (lack of) definitions here.] Further, the fact that homosexuality appears in other related species [Example], shows that homosexuality doesn't somehow stop evolution from happening, in the same way having sugar in the recipe obviously hasn't worked to keep recipes the same, or there would only be one sugary cake. Instead, cake recipes keep changing, and fruit cake recipes keep changing - which is to say, new mutations appear, and the relative populations of the different recipes change. And species with homosexual behaviours keep evolving. If it means ensuring the popularity/population remains the same, which is implied by "reduction in population growth", then the species is completely failing to be preserved. The population is growing, especially since the advent of homosexuality - i.e. the beginning of homo sapiens. [Ref] This weird argument defends a demonstrably false conclusion. False Premise 1 Fruit cakes don't contain formaldehyde. [Reference: I just made the claim it up, and I really hope it isn't true.] Homosexuality isn't a simple matter of genetics. Reference. Using a purely genetic argument to discuss the advent of homosexuality is flawed. False Premise 2 Even if fruit cakes did contain formaldehyde, it doesn't mean that it would act as a preservative in cakes. That would have to be shown empirically. Even if homosexuality was pure genetics, it doesn't mean that there is a reduction in population growth. That would have to be shown, and is possibly wrong. [Ref: one possible counter-hypothesis: kin selection] Mixing of Levels Even if cakes did contain formaldehyde and formaldehyde was a cake preservative, there is a huge difference between preserving an individual cake and preserving a recipe. They are at different levels of abstraction. The claim makes a similar (common) error of confusing how evolution works - the unit of evolution is the gene, not the species. Evolution works to preserve (i.e. increase the relative population of) the successful genes, even at the expense of the species. [Reference: The Selfish Gene] The suggestion that group selection might occur through natural selection is heavily disputed. This error in levels is further explained by evolutionary expert, Richard Dawkins, in his video addressing a similar question: "Is Homosexuality Nature’s Population Control?" Conclusion There are several false premises in the claim, showing a lack of understanding of populations and the biology of homosexuality. There is fault logic in the claim showing a lack of understanding of evolution. There is no clear definitions of the terms, making the question meaningless. I hope I have clearly demonstrated: both the original question and my invented analogous statement are fruit-cake claims, riddled with errors. 

They found no significant effect on mortality, complications of liver disease nor liver histology. They did find that : 

So, there are some false positives (tongue deviations in healthy patients) and a lot of false negatives (stroke and TIA patients without a deviation), but the results were promising in giving another sign to help a diagnosis. 

They found no evidence for this - they could only find flights that happened after the national airspace had reopened. 

Andrés Duarte published an analysis in Spanish, which is non-peer-reviewed and self-published, but fairly systematic. It was translated to English by Forgetomori. The sighting was not a single event, but a number of sightings spread out over two or three years. The conclusion reached was that the images were 

For this question, only the last two issues are relevant. Nanoparticles The nanoparticle debate extends past just sunscreens, into other personal care and cosmetic products. They are widely used and have had a good safety record. Nonetheless, some studies in rats suggested they may be photogenotoxic. 

Bed-wetting is a perfect place for sham cures to thrive. It is a non-life-threatening and largely self-limiting concern, where it is plausible a placebo could be quite effective. The Cochrane Collaboration examine and assess the evidence for medical treatments. Sure enough, they found a number of alternatives to health treatments had been tried, including chiropractic. 

I hope it is clear that a 2cm deep stab wound could be insignificant or fatal, depending on what part of the body is hit. The study authors seem to agree: 

I figure it is unlikely that there have been any formal peer-reviewed, rigorously controlled and blinded studies on this important issue, so I went to see what the manufacturers recommend. I randomly sampled some manufacturers (with perhaps some skew towards major manufacturers having manuals available online), and chose one manual each. Of the five I sampled (e.g. [1], [2]), four had lots of advice, such as turning pockets inside out and being careful of zippers, but no mention of snapping. One came close when it suggested: 

While they reviewed the literature, and list a number of health risks involved with body-piercings, there is no mention of fat, obesity or weight-gain. I conclude this is "evidence of absence" of studies showing that weight-gain is a risk. Note: I found the report to be less convincing than, say, a Cochrane Collaboration review. They didn't take the effort to demonstrate their search methods were exhaustive and clear from bias. Nonetheless, it was described as a "competent review" by the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-food Products Intended for Consumers, so I have accepted it. 

So, yes, reverse psychology can work in a clinical setting. (I am ignoring the more typical setting of dealing with recalcitrant children, because I think that has been shown to be somewhat effective in the short-term by virtually every parent.) 

From their graphs, we can see Antarctic Sea Ice is increasing from a (1981-2010) mean of 13.9 million sq km by 1.7% per decade, while Arctic Sea Ice is decreasing from a similar mean of 11.9 million sq km by 3.6% per decade. The decrease outweighs the increase. Addressing some of the other concerns in the Online Mail article, the NSIDC FAQ agrees that there is less attention of Antarctic Sea Ice 

One of the fundamental concepts of Chemistry - one of the most important ideas that have advanced science - is that everything is made of atoms. It doesn't matter, chemically, where the atoms come from, they still react the same way. So, from a health perspective, that they are waste products of another process is irrelevant. [Reference: Year 8 high school science class.] From a political standpoint that may be relevant, but that's not being argued here. From an emotional standpoint, we associate "waste" with "bad". If we replaced the emotive term "waste" with "recycled" suddenly it sounds positive! 

Now, suicide is not the opposite of happy, so the newspaper report was a bit off-the-point. One of the authors was involved in a later study: 

The claim that Uri Geller can read an envelope through paranormal means is unfalsifiable. Sure, we can show: 

I remember that event! The European IP Network's Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC - the acronym makes more sense in French) issued a case-study about the incident. 

In summary, while guests in Bahrain, people are expected to respect the local customs and laws (e.g. Ramadan), no matter what their personal religious beliefs. While guests in a US military base, people are expected to respect the local customs and laws (e.g. separation of church and state), no matter what their personal religious beliefs. 

That means, even though things change, they don't change as much as they could in the time available - which isn't that surprising. In particular, the author looks at mammals, starting in the Cenozoic (aka the Age of Mammals, 65 million years ago), and concludes the variation found is four orders of magnitude less (i.e. one ten-thousandth) than the time-scale permitted. Evolution is not constrained by time as much as it is constrained by form. 

Wikipedia provides several lists from different sources about the corporations with the largest number of employees: The Economist (2010) put Walmart after only the US and Chinese armies. The BBC (2012) agreed. Fortune (2012) excludes non-corporate employers, and has Walmart first. So these three sources agree that Walmart is the current largest corporate employer. Their estimates vary between 2.1 and 2.2 million employees, higher than the Facebook claim.
