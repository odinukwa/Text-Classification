Given that you're not training to become a professional juggler, I would advise against juggling the balls. 

On average I burn about 1-1.1 kcal / minute, which is pretty low given that my 2hr run yesterday burned an average of 12 kcal/minute. So while your mileage may vary, I'd probably burn somewhere between 60 and 90 kcal/hour regardless on what I'm sitting. To get 45 kcal more, you'd probably need to be in some very unbalanced position. 

To understand how these two sports might conflict, we need to delve deeper into how muscles are controlled. Chad Waterbury had this nice picture showing how a motor unit touches several muscle fibres. I suggest those who don't know what motor units are start reading up a little bit :-) 

The marathon training program I'm following has 5 workouts/week. If you do the Math, you'll see there's quite a lack of rest days. This program consists of the following runs: 30 mins, 2+ hr, 30 mins, 30 mins, rest, interval, rest. The need for rest days depends on the intensity of the runs, since in my case the 2+ hr run had to be performed at a relaxed pace. It was more important I ran for a long time, than that I tried to run fast. While your legs may feel heavy and sore the day after a long run, generally a sort relaxed run will actually make your legs feel better. This is most likely due to the increased blood flow, which helps get rid of any residues from the long run and supply your muscles with a healthy dose of blood, which can aid with the recovery. In my personal experience I always felt more sore after the interval training, than after the long run. Muscles get damaged more during intensive workouts, partially because the impacts are (much) higher and your muscles will need to generate a lot more energy in order to achieve higher speeds. You could switch your rest day to right after the long run, rather than before the interval training, but I think taking rest before the interval will help you perform that workout better. That way your muscles get the time to stack up on glycogen which you'll need for the interval. So no, you don't need a rest day right after a long run. But your mileage with my answer will vary with the intensity level of that run. If its a race, yes you will need some rest. 

Marathon recovery for me is generally very very easy jogs, riding a bike, walks, stretching 2-3 times a day, drinking water, and massages. Specifically stretching, massages, and light 30 min workouts of the affected muscles simply to get blood flowing in them are the keys in my opinion. Its kinda funny that the best way to recover from this is to do more of it at an easy effort for 30 minutes. I still have doubts about this method before doing it while Im sore but it works pretty well everytime so far. Id say reverse taper but if your friends weren't well prepared then telling them this likely wont be helpful to them. 

What does it mean to bonk or hit the wall during a run or a bike ride? That is the main question, but to generate a more detailed answer here please consider these corollary questions: Can this can be a fairly serious thing, so what are the effects of this that makes it so serious? Is bonking the same as hitting a wall?? Please explain what causes a bonk to occur, what things you would experience before, during, and after. Are there benefits to bonking? If hitting the wall is different then please elaborate on this too. 

I like Avery Bartlett's plan, but if you want simple then try this. Run easy for 30 min every other day and for one hour on the weekend. No pace or distance. Skipping is fine but try not to skip the hour run, and dont try to make up fo missed runs. This is generally called based building and the goal is to get out and run before actually starting any kind of training program. That seems to fall in line with your approach too which is nice. Do this for a month and if you want more then first get your weekend long hour up to 2 hours then start a program. By the way most of the training programs are very similar, and consist of running hard 1-2 times a week, easy 2-3 times a week, and long 0-1 times a week (2.5-3 hours once a month minimum). 

Its not bad. You are probably shifting your weight by doing this. I got the standard pushup PhD from the Army. There are several different ways to do a pushup and if you do a set each way you'll get more of a workout in and do more overall. The biggest boost in strength Ive gotten from pushups have come from repeatedly going through muscle failure in many different ways in the same workout. Using my knees became a normal part of my routine. Also became a fan of the 8 count pushup where you start standing and get down to do two then recover. Im not very strong in my arms so Ive always had to work harder than others to get that strength, so that was one good way for me to get it. For situps though I never grabbed my legs and followed the advice that it will hurt your back, but I did the same thing in general. There are a bunch of ways of doing a situp too. Actually Ive started doing the same thing for running related strength training. Yeah so the answer is yes because overall you extend the session training yourself to do that one fundamental movement... ... darn, another reason for long runs. 

On a side note, I had a roommate who suffered from overly lax ligaments (possibly as a consequence of Marfan Syndrome) and he got a lot of enjoyment out of volleyball and frisbee, although he gets most of his exercise by working on his farm. He enjoyed the double-jointed parlor tricks, but mentioned that he gets joint pain really easily, which is why he never did any sort of running. 

This question led me to this video, apparently of Dejan "STIPKE" Stipic, doing various feats of bodyweight strength. In the pull-ups, dips, and squats, there's a fellow beside him who gives a light slap to the limb in action at the top of the motion. You can see it being done with some of the other background athletes as well. Is this a standard thing to do when spotting someone in bodyweight movements? Does this do something physical like help the muscle to relax (seems unlikely to me, since they only seem to be tapping one side) or is this just a way to let the person know they've hit full extension (possibly hard to tell on multiple reps due to muscle engorgement causing numbness)? 

For a low tech solution, use a curb. :) Pavement is rough enough to rub them away, and it's easy enough, every time you're sitting somewhere, waiting for a bus or for your ride, to gently rub away at it bit by bit. 

From personal experience, I'd recommend doing something like gymnastics (many gymnastics schools offer an "adult tumbling" class so you won't be sharing the mat with 8-year-olds in leotards) or a martial art like Kung Fu or Capoeira which emphasizes mobility. In both cases, you're constantly moving, and building muscle tone to support yourself in various positions, but bulk is limited by the fact that you're balancing building enough muscle to support yourself against the need to keep bulk down so that you have strength enough to lift yourself. Plus, they tend to be fun, with a variety of different exercises so that you're not likely to get bored with it any time soon. Lastly, they obviously promote agility, since it's a core aspect of the work. Parkour is another possibility, albeit one that's more daunting for many people, and more difficult to find classes for. If taking an actual class is not feasible (I work full time and have other activities, so I know I haven't had room for a class in ages), these activities often have home study materials you can use. I'd probably edge towards martial arts in that case. If you live in a decent-size town, the odds are that you can get a Capoeira workout DVD from the library for free. Parkour is a bit trickier in that a) there are fewer codified resources and b) it can be tricky to learn to do safely without a teacher, although there are some very good YouTube videos (I highly recommend Amos Rendao's roll tutorial, both amusing and informative). Lastly, gymnastics may seem daunting for practicing at home without a teacher, but doing handstands against walls and practicing controlled cartwheels is doable without specialized equipment or instruction with little risk of injury. 

For myself I can do 2-3 times as many crunches, and always do some crunches after sit ups to continue working some of the muscles. The main group of muscles neglected in crunches seem to be the back and legs. In the military you get 2 minutes to do as many as possible, and I found that to do this I also had to push myself down and go up without relying on people holding your feet. So in my experience I usually used alot more than just the abs. Hope this helps 

My solution which is insufficient to someone is to hang my clothes up on a hanger in the shower immediately and use a towel just for cleaning up sweat and to walk around the house. This doesn't work when there is company though. Where are the close voters at? The economy really must be doing better. Plus I've been forced to use shoe deodorant now (which I'm grateful). Next I think I'll add a step to rinse out the clothes since they are hanging in the shower. 

The 400m distance is used to prepare for 5k races apparently, so can the times done in training be used to predict a 5k race time accurately? If not then is racing a shorter distance the only way to predict a 5k time? Actually this is the same as asking if there is a similar workout for 5k as the Yasso 800s workout for a marathon prediction time. 

Jeff Galloway's book can answer the question on how to correlate the run/walk ratio to a given pace using specific formulas, and from a given pace to the run/walk ratio. The gains to walking inbetween running drop off quickly past the 1 minute mark according to some research Galloway gives or I read somewhere else. From my experience the run/walk method gives your body a chance to recover, clean up some lactate acid, give your muscles a break, allows you to run longer, allows a faster method to change pace, and allows many short spurts of faster running. These last two are my conclusions. Ive found that it is harder to run too hard when your taking short breaks because just changing paces by walking takes some effort in itself. Also Ive found that at a start of a run interval the easy pace is significantly faster than if I slowed down while running. You might not run the same pace for any run/walk ratio for short distances unless that distance relatively long for you. For example if you cant run the 5k without stopping then 5k is long. Also dont assume that a 1 mile pace can be done over a 5k distance. If you look at the paces each world record is done at the pace will get slower over distance. Use the formula (your 1 mile pace)*(5k WR pace)/(1 mile WR pace) = your 5k pace. I think if the run distance part of the run walk ratio is much smaller than the overall distance then you'll find that the run/walk pace is faster. If you want an example then check out a 46 mile run Ive done using 5 min run 30 second walk (maybe 1 minute walk??) and the training I did to do it (not as much as you'd expect). Compare to a better trained 50k run but shorter without regular breaks. Sometimes checking out what other people are doing can help you achieve your goal too. I advise you to buy Galloway's book because he tells you exactly what to do. Local running clubs are the next best bet and you can get your running questions answered while your running, or at breakfast afterwards with your new running friends (or old friends that are now running friends too). Ok, last thing. Try 30 min to an hour of walking fast. Putting power into your hips, keeping your feet moving fast, and try to hit 15 min miles. Then aim for 12 min miles. I was surprised to hit a few 13 min miles while recovering from an injury, and I keep much of my speed from walking and biking during a 4-6 week recovery.
