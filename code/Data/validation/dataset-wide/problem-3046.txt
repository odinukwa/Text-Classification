In fact Abwher parachutists were infiltrated by air into Afghanistan and these men were responsible for collecting Bose from the Khyber pass and leading him to Kabul where there was an airstrip used to repatriate him to Germany via Rhodes. Some time later there was a flight to China made by the Italian Servizi Aerei Speciali using the SM 75 aircraft, "MM-60539." The original successful flight left via the Crimea at great peril so the second of these flights was proposed via the same airfield in Kabul. Some Italian archives are available which detail this: Sources: ACS, Ministero Aeronautica, Gabinetto, busta 69 Vol 9 Gabaereo to Ministero degli Affari Esterni November 13, 1942 Vol 10 Ministero dell' Aeronautica Appunto per il Duce November 13, 1942 Vol 10 Gabaereo to Stato Maggiore R.Aeronautica November 17, 1942 Vol 10 Gabaereo to Stato Maggiore R.Aeronautica December 1, 1942 There was no need to infiltrate Bose back into India as he was worth more to the Axis being sent back to Japan via the submarine base at Singapore to influence Indians in Malayan POW camps to desert and join the Axis cause 

There is further corroboration by a USN Intelligence report dated June 15, 1945 concerning "German Technology Transfer to Japan" In Chapter 14 of that document it states this: 

It was France and Britain who originally declared war on Germany for the invasion of Poland. For two years the United States sat on its hands and wanted nothing to do with the war in Europe. One might equally ask what gave USA the right to sit at the table, since USA only got involved after the attack on Pearl Harbour? 

More controversially, the USN made Magic intercepts of signals between Berlin and Tokyo discussing Japan's requirement for shipments of uranium for a secret atomic bomb project based in Korea (Imperial 8th Army Laboratory). Irrespective of whether one agrees, or disagrees that Japan completed an atomic bomb, Allies were aware from July 1943 of such a project in Korea. If japan had an Atomic Bomb project in Korea it needed to protect that project and give it time for fruition. Japan's secret War, Robert K Wilcox 

In another document prepared at the end of the war from interrogations of interned combatants by the US Naval Technical Mission Europe, cited as: “Investigations, Research, Developments and Practical Use of the German Atomic Bomb” dated 19 August 1945. In that document there was an affidavit actually written by an interpreter Captain Helenes T Freiberger of the testimony given under interrogation by pilot observer Hauptman Hans Zinsser who said: 

According to a wartime report held on microfilm file at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, S.R.A.4394, the US 9th Army captured a working German Atomic bomb on 26 April 1945 near Goslar. The device known as 76-Zentner weighed 3.8 tons and the document notes it was flown back to the United States by Col Charles Lindbergh who in addition to being a qualified B-24 pilot was also a consultant to the US Navy Technical Mission Europe. During 1945 Allied advances overran underground factories housing at least 60+ Anschutz Mark IIIB Uranium centrifuges each capable of enriching 250grams of Uranium by 7% per 24 hours. During each 12 day cycle these could produce 15kg of HEU enriched to 80% U235. At this rate Germany was capable during the second half of 1944 of producing enough HEU for one Hiroshima type bomb every 7 weeks. Sources; NARA G-344 (9 Apr. 1946) Jesse W. Beams, "Report on the use of the centrifuge method for the concentration of U235 by the Germans."

The Nazis had some bizarre supernatural beliefs and Himmler himself created a branch of the SS concerned with investigation of the supernatural called the Ahenenerbe. They sent investigators to Tibet to learn eastern mysticism. The Nazis believed in some kind of supernatural beings called the Vrill people who were supposed to reside within the earth. I don't know an awful lot about this but it is something one could research. The most disturbing aspect was experiments on human subjects at Dachau which gave rise to the myth of Nazi Zombies. This was experiments where camp inmates were literally frozen to death in cold water and then efforts were made to re-animate their corpses. 

After the invasion of Poland in 1939, but prior to the invasion of France in 1940 there was a joint Anglo-French plan to launch bombing raids against oil fields in Baku and Romania. These plans were stymied by Turkish opposition to overflights. 

Hitler put up a cogent argument from the German perspective that prior to 1918 Czechoslovakia had simply been a part of Austria and Czechoslovakia's independence had therefore isolated and disadvantaged large communities of Germans outside of Germany's new borders. It is the same argument playing out now in the eastern Ukraine as pretext for Russian intervention. With Anschluss in Austria, Hitler felt empowered to seek "reunification" of the old pre-1918 Austria and thus issued a series of demands known as the Carlsbad Program. Edvard Benes rejected Hitler's demands and mobilised the Czech Army. A propaganda war emerged and lurid false tales of Sudeten Germans being abused by Czech forces were relayed to Britain. The Nazis instigated a series of mass demonstrations and protests by Sudeten Germans inside Czechoslovakia. In talks with Hitler attempting to avert a crises Chamberlain agreed with Hitler to appease him. France and Britain gave the Czechoslovaks an ultimatum: to cede all the territories with a German population of 50 percent or greater to the German Reich in return for the security of knowing Czechoslovakia would remain independent. Czechoslovakia replied with a resounding “no.” Finally in September 1938 the Czech position faltered when Mussolini withdrew Italy's support for Czech independence. Benes refused to resist the Germans any further without western support thus Chamberlain pulled the plug on all hope of resistance. Benes placed his country's fate in the hands of negotiation by the British and French What is little understood however is that Czechoslovakia had very large Gold reserves lodged with the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland so Chamberlain and Daldier negotiated the Munich Agreement with Hitler to permit reunification of the Sudetenland. Hitler undertook to go no further into Czechoslovakia but the subsequent internal collapse of what was left permitted Hitler to take all of the country not long after. Shamefully France and Britain tied their acquiescence to German demands with their obtaining a share of the loot and seizure of Czech Gold reserves in Switzerland as German war reparations. This is the deepest shame of what Britain did to the people of a once prosperous little nation. Chamberlain did not merely let down the Czech people. He helped himself to that nation's Gold reserves. 

Less well known is that Dresden was home to a plasma physics laboratory led by Prof Max Steenbeck, part of the Ardenne institute for nuclear physics. According to the autobiography of Nazi nuclear physicist Rolf Wideroe he and a team of others recovered an advanced particle accelerator which earlier in the war had been used as a particle beam weapon against Allied bombers in the Frankfurt area. Rolf Wideroe Dresden "Death Ray" machine Wideroe noted that his team dug the device out of the rubble and transported it SW to Burggrub near Bayeruth where General Patton's Army captured the device intact on 14th April 1945. Auergesselschaft Given that the US 8th Air Force also pulverised the Auer Uranium refinery at Oranienberg on 15th March 1945, it may be that the destruction of Dresden was intended to destroy nuclear facilities to prevent them falling into Soviet hands. 

Germany had preparations to take Iceland itself by air in exactly the same way they took Crete. The proposal required one way flights by an armada of Ju-53/3m aircraft. It is possible that knowledge of German intentions sparked the Allied annexation of Iceland. 

Germany became a clandestine arms supplier as a way to build its own industrial capabilities, for example building U-boats for Turkey before WW2. foreign U-boats This included Bombers for the Swedes and fighters for the Spanish Civil War. Swedish Junkers Torpedo Bombers The He-115 floatplane was exported before the war to both Finland Sweden and Norway. MI.6 obtained and operated five of these Norwegian He-115 aircraft in clandestine operations against Germany during the war He-115 history Germany also supplied fighters and Wright Cyclone engine powered He-111 bombers to the Nationalist Chinese before WW2 and assisted the Soviets to re-arm. "The He-111 was exported and/or produced in a number of different countries. He-111s were shipped to China, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey and Bulgaria." History of the He-111 In addition to the hardware they provided mercenary crews as a way to gain experience. Source Bund Archiv Freiburg Russian pilot training for Luftwaffe 

The German scientists behind this 5kg warhead were Haxel, Schumann & Trinks. What they developed was a method for detonating sub critical fissile mass by a process known as Fusion boosted Fission. It uses the plasma Pinch concept to ignite a mass of uranium far below the critical mass by using nuclear fusion to replicate the neutron flux required in a fissile mass at criticality. 

The Kwantung Army in Manchuria was largely made up from a Division of Indian soldiers who had defected from the British Army in Burma. They were considered unreliable soldiers by both sides. Control of Manchuria ("Manchukuo") denied America the ability to forward base aircraft in China within easy striking range of the home islands, however that was just one consideration. It also safeguarded sources of coal and iron-ore, protecting Korea ("Choesul") where a large ammonia nitrate factory at Hamhung ("Konan") produced two thirds of Japan's explosives requirements. There was also a large Tachikawa aircraft factory at Shenyang ("Mukden") which still manufactures aircraft [Mig jet fighters] for modern China to this day. In January 1945 the Mukden Arsenal also began manufacturing V-2 rockets under the leadership of Dr Yamada who had returned from Germany, which were intended for the defence of China and the home islands. Indeed U-219 arrived at Djakarta from France in November 1944 carrying 12 dismantled V-2 rockets for Japan. 

Poland was simply ethnically cleansed by the Russians who force marched entire German families out of Silesia into east Germany. Before there was any civil authority created in Silesia Polish Jews freed from incarceration created their own Freedom committees. For at least the first six months after Germany's capitulation these were the only real authority. These former Kz inmates took over whatever accommodations they wanted. 

I have read that a German U-boat refueling at Villa Cisneros was attacked and sunk. I have also read that After Germany Invaded Russia in 1941 a Japanese technical mission returning to Japan was flown to Rio de Janiro via Vila Cisneros on the Atlantic coast. According to a book The "Nazi Menace" in Argentina, 1931-1947 By Ronald C. Newton, A German General was flown to Argentina to organise former crew members of the Graff Spee who escaped captivity in Uruguay into building an airstrip at Cordoba for receiving long range flights from Germany. Prior to WW2 and up until Brazil joined the Alliance against Germany in 1943, vila Cisneros was a regular waypoint for trans-Atlantic flights by the Italian airline LATI. Please can anybody enlarge upon this issue and provide any sources for further reading? What role did Vila Cisneros play in the later half of WW2? LATI carried mail 

Argentina maintained diplomatic relations with Germany until March 1945. Germany ran a clandestine air bridge to Argentina via Barcelona and Villa Czneros until the very end of the war. Gottfreide Standstede and Wilhelm Seidlitz at Delfino Shipping were responsible for an Abwher smuggling chain through Spain to germany to defeat the Allied blockade. 

Tantric Buddhism absorbed many of the Bon (shaman) concepts and the two religions co-existed in many ways. It was more an overlay of Buddist theology over Shaman practice and beliefs, than a total ousting of one by the other. On the other hand with respect to the previously warlike Tibetan Empire which the Chinese had feared, with the adoption of Buddhist values Tibet retreated into more of a hermit kingdom eschewing interaction with neighbouring states. Whilst various sects like Karma pa and Gelugs pa clashed with each other, their focus was inward and the impetus for territorial imperialism which had existed under former kings vanished. 

Nazi Germany developed tactical nuclear weapons as early as June 1942 This was detailed in a Magic decrypt held in NSA archives known as "Stockholm to Tokyo, No. 232.9 December 1944 (War Department), RG 457, declassified October 1, 1978. It was sent by the Japanese embassy in Stockholm decrypted on 12 December 1944. It refers to German development of a 5 kilogram nuclear warhead. This signal states in part that: 

Generally served either as minelayers or convoy escorts. Their net effect was more as a deterrent. relatively little success against U-boats with a few notable exceptions.

Oak Ridge Uranium enrichment at K-25 was a spectacularly inefficient project which only managed to enrich 15kg of U235 by April 1945. The German ultracentrifuge process was 30 times more efficient than the American gaseous diffusion enrichment process. The Haniford Plutonium project by contrast proved reasonably competent using un-enriched Uranium to produce Neptunium 239. When the Mark II Trinity bomb worked there was a collective sigh of relief. The Mark I Uranium bomb used against Hiroshima was in-fact a captured German bomb transferred to USA in April 1945 after its capture at Goslar. Under operation Overcast it was converted to US needs by captured German scientists with the the addition of a box shaped tailfin, known as the California Brake.
