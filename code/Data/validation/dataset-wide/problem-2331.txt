Let's assume you've not got to the kidney failure end of matters, which causes electrolyte imbalance and that we're not accounting for medical conditions or medications. Instead stick to those which are associated with dehydration and the causes of dehydration. Dehydration reduces the ability of the kidneys to remove excess calcium from the body. This will cause mild hypercalcemia and is likely to by asymptomatic. Equally, an increase in chloride can have no symptoms, but in some cases can present with thirst, difficulty breathing and weakness. And high levels of potassium can cause heart rhythm problems. Low levels of magnesium can be caused by sweating and the symptoms are normally associated with severe dehydration. These include muscle weakness, shakes & twitches, nausea, vomiting, lower limb cramps and changes in blood pressure which if low could cause fainting. You are unlikely to get a phosphate imbalance due to dehydration as far as my research goes. Sodium is the annoying one as you can have both low sodium because you sweat it out and high sodium due to lack of free water. Symptoms of low sodium include headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion and fatigue. High sodium can cause increased thirst, confusion, lethargy and muscle twitches. So, my original list of symptoms of dehydration are actually symptoms of electrolyte imbalance, but for the first one. This is because they are so tightly linked. 

The foam inside the mat prevents heat loss through convection which would be the case with the air if there was nothing to prevent it moving. This forms part of the open cell vs closed cell argument for sleeping mats. 

Woman here. No, I do not believe it's safe for women to hike alone. While most men in the western world would never harm a woman, women are magnets for the minority who would, and there are enough opportunistic predators out there that women find themselves being assaulted at the most random times while trying to perform the most mundane tasks. I don't think the good guys out there really are able to understand what women actually face with regards to their safety, unless they have daughters, but I don't fault these men for their lack of insight and understanding. In most instances, as they are good guys who are down right disgusted by the thought of a man hurting a woman, they just really have a hard time fathoming that there are any non-negligible quantity of guys out there that would hurt a woman at all. And they don't have the life experiences of a woman to show them otherwise. I spend 95% of my time surrounded by men, often in primarily male environments, and with that in mind, the number of times I've been threatened or harassed in some way by a man, for the fact that I am a woman, is small. However "small" is not "zero", and it only takes one instance of violence to harm or kill or victimize you. In my life, I've had random, often much older men try to coax me into their car on more than one occasion, and men online send me unsolicited photos of their genitals on countless occasions. I've been harassed on public transportation by men who have approached me to say sexually explicit things, and have then proceeded to follow me and would not leave me alone until crowds scared them away. I've had men become hostile because I've told them politely that I wasn't interested (one told me to "f#ck off and die"), and one acquaintance, who thought I had rejected when i informed him that I was busy on the day he had asked me to go out with him on, responded by tossing a full cup of ice out the window at me from a speeding car. I've had guys say "Hello" to me on the street as if they were nice, respectable people, only to start harassing me with sexual suggestions when I was kind enough to say "Hello" back. And this was in a city where, sure, you run into more people, and thus more bad people, but a lot of them are inhibited by the crowds. But what if I were to run into one of these guys alone in the middle of nowhere? What is to stop them from going as far as they want? I will level with you all. I'm 5'2, 127lbs and have trouble benching the bar, which is 40lbs. At my strongest, with serious training, I could never bench more than 65lbs. Do you think I could easily subdue the average sized man? Women do not fight men off with their strength. When you hear on the news that a woman managed to fight off her attacker, what actually happened was the woman made a commotion and scared the attacker off because he was afraid other people would come see what all the commotion was about and find out what he was trying to do to her. I'd love to live in a world where I did not have to deal with these issues and had the same freedom to explore on my own without the added liability that being a woman presents. Heck, I'd even settle for a world where taking the trash out at 2am wasn't something that forced me to ask myself "Do I take the trash out and risk getting raped? Or do I put up with the smell until morning?" but that's just not my lot in life. 

If you are sweating in your sleeping bag all night then the insulation level is too high. Try wearing less or no clothing as well as your ventilation solution. 

Your urine will be darker. You'll get a headache. You'll get a bunch of symptoms like lethargy and confusion which others are more likely to notice. You'll feel thirsty. 

I would not advise putting wet socks anywhere near anything that's preventing you from getting cold if it would generate a risk of hypothermia through decreased insulation or increased heat conductivity. Using your body heat to dry socks is dangerous in cold conditions as you're taking heat from yourself. With this in mind, you should use an external heat source to dry your socks. This could be a fire or as you mentioned, hand warmer. Socks can also dry in the wind, so if you can arrange for them to be exposed to wind whilst being protected from rain then that will also work. As you mentioned, water can also be extracted using an absorbent material, such as a towel. You would have to decide which is more important to be dry at the time. Greater efficiency can be gained by an arrangement where water has a good route for escape and does not pool. 

When we get cold vasoconstriction occurs. This prevents the blood at the extremities being subject to heat conduction away from the body. This is not an adaption, this is a reaction. The body emits heat all the time because the body working and but wants to remain at constant temperature. If the ambient temperature is such that we can lose this heat, we won't get hotter. If it's such that we lose more because it's cold, we will get colder. Sleeping bags keep us warm by insulating us from the outside world. We would not want to be totally insulated or we'd just get hotter and hotter. Rather, we need the level of insulation to be such that the rate at which we are losing heat is the same as the rate at which it is being conducted and convected away. This is why we have higher insulation in the winter where rate of heat loss to the environment is higher. 

Depends on what you are going for. If you are heading this up, expect it to be a full-time endeavor for at least a year, and then part time for the lifetime of the hut. Like Nivag said, there are lots of different types of huts, so you have to decide on what you want before anything else. This will depend a lot on how much work you want to put into it, the economic, political, and environmental climate in your region, what people who will use it actually want, etc. If there is no infrastructure already in place (and I'm assuming you still need to work a job to feed yourself), you'll probably want a very basic hut that is unstaffed - basically, an emergency shelter. As an American, I've used these sorts of things a lot. Here are the things I would like in a hut: 3-4 walls and a roof that doesn't leak. Leaving one wall open will stop the nasties from building up inside, and will discourage squatters. If the wind blows from a constant direction, you can face the open wall the opposite way. In a pinch, a tarp can be set up to make a temporary 4th wall to keep most of the weather out. However, very harsh weather might necessitate a 4th wall. An elevated floor. Getting flooded in the middle of the night sucks. Clotheslines/pegs in the walls. Places to hang things. When it rains, I want to hang my stuff up to dry. In addition, hanging my pack up at night clears a lot of space for other people. A broom to sweep out debris. A shovel to dig cat holes. A privy - maybe. Once you build the hut, it will attract people. Eventually, the number of people it attracts will be large enough that human waste becomes an issue. At this point, you need a privy. There are lots of different kinds. Do your research to see what works best for your needs in your environment. Some way to keep rodents out of my food. Tenting, they aren't usually a problem, because they are dispersed across the landscape. Building a hut, increased human population means increased food droppage in the area, which leads to a higher rodent population. Rodent hang lines can be made easily out of bits of garbage: $URL$ Also, try to build your hut without many small nooks and crannies, as rodents will build their nests there if not ousted from time to time. Water. A good stream nearby is always a plus. A view. Not necessary, and it should be superseded by other factors like weather. But when there is one, it is a very nice plus. I wouldn't recommend storing things that are small and easy to take, unless you intend or people to take them. Unless you plan on staffing it, your visitors should be prepared to make due on their own. 

Something to be aware of is that many of the above symptoms are also associated with thing that can happen outdoors such as heat stroke, hypothermia, sleep deprivation, malnutrition and low blood sugar. So to answer the question about "needing salts", you'll be looking for: 

There are two components to staying warm and it's all generally centred around thermodynamics. You want to stay at one temperature and physics wants you to become the temperature of the your environment. You body, if 100% efficiently insulated, would get hotter and hotter because it's generating heat from all the bodily processes and chemical reactions going on, especailly movement. The source of this heat energy is food which is processed and/or stored in your body and if no fuel is going in, then your body itself. Equally, if you were 0% insulated, you would cool down at a rate proportionate to the difference in temperature between you and the outside world. To this, you add the heat energy you're generating and ultimately you get a rate of decrease in temperature. Somewhere between the two is a level of insulation which essentially allows you to create an equilibrium between the rate of generation of heat and the rate of loss. This is how you stay the right temperature. So some tips are: 

You might consider boiling it up with some berries, (suitable) plants or pine needles. In terms of treatment tablets, there are neutralisers to sort the taste out, but they are not perfect. For a double solution, you might want to try those effervescent vitamin c tablets. Orange is nice.
