Partisan primaries Allow voters to choose who will represent their political party by a partisan primary. This empowers the extremes in a party, as it is much easier to dominate the party than the electorate as a whole. Commit primary voters Currently, primary voters in the United States can vote for the candidate of the other party in the general election. Change that. So moderates have even less reason to vote in primaries. But if they do vote, then they can't vote in the general. Their vote will be automatically cast for the winner of the primary in which they voted. Powerful and moderate judiciary If the judiciary rules on something, then it is much harder for politicians to rally support for the position that the judiciary took and much easier to rally against them. This is because supporters expect the judiciary to fix things for them. So they don't worry as much about what the politicians might do. Meanwhile, opponents feel powerless and marginalized. I.e. ready for extremism. Single chamber parliament Multiple chambers or a separate nationally elected figure require more cooperation for everyday operation. And the overlapping districts make it easier for big parties that compete in every district. Different candidates support each other. So reduce levels as much as possible. The same representatives for municipal elections as national elections. It's just that only some of them vote in municipal, school, county, or state parliaments. Appoint executive positions by legislative votes. So the head of state and ministers are appointed to the positions. 

Miracles The aliens could perform miraculous things and then see how we explain them. For example, it is common to use aliens or time travelers in science fiction to explain 

This plan might not immediately turn the interior desert into one giant oasis, but it provides immediate benefit in terms of placing people inside the desert. You don't have to open up the entire "canal" at once. You can dig the hole first and then connect the hole up to the ocean (or to the next hole) with a tunnel. Over time, you can build enough tunnels to cut through the continent. And over time, you can build more and more holes so that more of the tunnel is open to the sky. The biggest problem that I see with your original proposal is that it basically says to first dig a trench that may be six hundred meters deep and a kilometer wide at the bottom (more at the top). That's an incredibly huge project that offers no benefit until it's finished. This avoids that by digging a tunnel instead. The tunnel can be narrower in the beginning and made wider over time. It allows for incremental changes. Also, the mirrors allow for much steeper sides. One of the largest problems though will be to keep the tunnel open. The channel will likely need to be cleared of silt regularly. Fortunately this doesn't have to be done continuously, so it can be solar/wind powered. That would mean more silt clearers though (the less it runs, the more clearing that needs to be done when it does run). This proposal might eventually lead to your wide trench, but it has benefits far before that. 

When you optimize for a different statistic than the one that really matters to you, you get improvement in the wrong statistic. Fuel economy was not what was important. Fuel usage was. But instead of taking measures to control fuel usage, like a gasoline tax, they optimized around one possible solution, fuel economy of new things arbitrarily classified as cars. European gas taxes Contrast this with what European countries saw with increased gasoline (which they may call petrol) taxes: 

If you think of war as being like chess, war with robot soldiers is more like go. Instead of battling to control territory directly, battle will consist of trying to take control of the other side's robots. Then when you steal the other side's robots, you will control the territory that they did. In Terminator 2 and later, they had terminators that John Connor had reprogrammed. They'd yank the power and reprogram them one by one. Presumably robot armies would have better ways of doing that. Perhaps they'd just flash over the programming. Or they'd pull the chip and replace. Even ignoring hackers, consider what happens when the enemy captures your command center. Now they have physical access to the controls. Or destroy the command center so that the robots can't be updated. Multiple command centers to avoid that? Destroy or capture all of them. The more of them there are, the easier it is to capture one (and turn the robots against their owners). But the harder it is to destroy them. Or consider covert action. A spy gets access to a command center and modifies the robots' programming or uploads new software that turns them over to the enemy. Perhaps someone will eventually decide to work past these problems and try it. But there are reasons why militaries might prefer humans to robots as soldiers. 

Well, if you take the maximum carrying capacity of the Earth as fifty billion people, then the maximum city size is around forty-nine billion people. Presumably it would be located in Europe, Asia, and possibly Africa. If you have trouble seeing how we get to fifty billion people, remember that we aren't limited to farms on land. Sea-based farms can also provide nutrition and do not require irrigation. Another option is putting farms on top of the city. Build underground and leave the soil intact above. 

Distributed Distribution The key to allowing a document to spread is to distribute the distribution. If you only have a single source for the document, it's easy enough to stomp on that source. If others are disseminating similar versions of the document containing the original message, then it's much harder. So make something that is easy to transmit and modify the nonessential elements. An example would be an HTML document with variable CSS. So it might start with your image as the background, but people could change it to have their own image. Some might also turn it into a JPEG or similar image format. This makes the single document turn into multiple documents. You can't stop just the original. You have to stomp out all the variants as well. Two Parts Another possibility is to break the message into two parts. The first part goes out and becomes a mystery. What does it mean? It becomes an internet meme, but it doesn't get stomped because the critical people don't recognize it as dangerous. Then the explanation goes out. Because the original was popular, the explanation will be as well. And the explanation will travel much faster given that it just needs to follow the path that the mystery has already broken. Hackers Hack the censored network and allow the message to escape. This has long precedent in science fiction. The noble resistance taking over the airwaves to reach the populace. Perhaps someone pretends to be part of the system until trusted enough to have the access to slip a message into the stream. Or a small band of armed revolutionaries take over a television station while it's broadcasting globally. Or a computer hacker remotely bypasses the security to add a message. All of the Above You don't have to choose just one approach. Use distributed distribution to get the mystery out and then hack the network to get the explanation out. Or pick two out of three. 

First, most medieval walls are going to be rough enough that a good climber can just climb them. That is to say that they are similar to a cliff face, with enough holds to allow climbing. Even if we assume that your thief cannot do that. Look for narrow chimney-like spaces created by the fortifications. It's possible to climb those even without handholds. Some tips from rock climbing. The basic idea is to use pressure to maintain height and shift position frequently. I'm not convinced that knife blades in gloves is what you want. Knife blades in boots makes more sense to me. Carrying actual daggers in one's hands makes more sense to me than trying to put small, breakable blades at the end of one's fingers. Or even better, use picks that are tied to your belt by a slack rope. That said, most rock climbers go the other way and wear thin footwear and thin or fingerless gloves so as to be able to better feel the rocks. 

Of course, if they succeed, then those things will create their own problems. In particular, the definition of "proper" beliefs differs from person to person. Out of power, multiple beliefs can ally with the same people. They each expect to prevail after victory. In power, only one actually wins. The others can join the libertarian opposition. Violent? I'm not sure that violent revolution is the way to go. A libertarian government can always react to a violent revolution by becoming less libertarian. It can compromise its beliefs and respond. It is less able to respond to an electoral challenge. Initially, its opponents are the ones proposing compromise. They sound like the reasonable, accommodating ones. They can take over the apparatus of government democratically and use that legitimacy to prevent a response. They can gradually replace the defenders of the old system with their own people. A slow increase in repression means that no individual act of repression seems inexcusable to most people. A violent rebellion means that both the populace and the government are against the rebellion. Without the legitimacy of a democratic election, the rebels are immediately vulnerable to a counter rebellion. It also makes the opposition immediate. An electoral challenge allows them to concentrate on the popular aspects of their ideology. Either needs popular support. A movement with enough support for a violent rebellion would seem to have enough support for an electoral takeover. And a libertarian government is ill-prepared to resist electoral takeover. After all, if that's what people choose to do, freedom of action says that they should be able to do so. Meanwhile, a violent rebellion can be put down with self-defense, by the well-armed populace with help from what government there is. Becoming what you resist Another alternative is to have a fascist rebellion that loses but leaves the country more fascist in response. Because we can't tell who is and is not a rebel, we confiscate all guns. Because the rebels were so bad, we outlaw the speeches that they gave. Because the rebels were most effective when they assembled into large groups, we outlaw large groups without licenses. Once those kinds of controls exist, they are more likely to be used. Rebel speeches were bad, but so are those advocating lies. Or denigrating women. Or criticizing law enforcement. Or advocating against laws against speeches...
