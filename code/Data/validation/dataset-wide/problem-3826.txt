The Szemerédi–Trotter bound is known to be false for circles (it is true for circles with the same radii). There is a construction that gives $N^{2/3}|C|^{2/3}\log^{1/3}N$ incidences. The current best upper bound is about $N^{6/11}|C|^{9/11}$, and this is conjectured to be far from tight (see for example this recent result of Sharir and Zahl). You can find a similar correct argument in Claim 1.6.4 here. 

Many combinatorial problems can be reduced to bounding the number of edges in a given graph with $n$ vertices. Each time I encounter such a problem, I check whether the corresponding graph has a property that is known to imply a bound on number of edges (as probably most people do). For example, whether the graph is planar. My question is what graph properties imply a bounded number of edges. I assume that there are such properties that I am not familiar with, and it seems quite useful to have a list of these properties. I am only interested in cases where the number of edges is asymptotically smaller than $n^2$ (for example, Turan's Theorem is not relevant). Some properties that I am already familiar with: 

Very little is known about the question (and even about the easier case of vertex degrees), and it contains as a special case some notoriously hard questions: For example the case that all $d_i$s are equal to 1 (or to some $\lambda$ is the question on the existence of combinatorial designs of certain parameters. I suppose that even checking if a sequence is a dgree sequence is computationally intractable, for large values of $d$ but I am not sure about that. 

Micha Perles used Gale diagrams to compute the number of simplicial $d$-polytopes with $d+3$ vertices and of general $d$-polytopes with $d+3$ vertices. The computation can be found in Chapter 6.3 of Grunbaum's book, "Convex polytopes". My question is for formulas for the number of simplicial $d$-polytopes with $d+3$ labelled vertices and general $d$-polytopes with $d+3$ labelled vertices. The Gale-diagram technique should apply (and probably be easier) but I am not aware of this being done. One motivation would be in trying to compute the number of simplicial d-polytopes, triangulations of $(d-1)$-spheres (and related non simplicial objects) with $d+4$ labelled vertices. 

Assume we have a $3\times 3$ grid with rows and columns being short exact sequences of $C^*$-algebras. This gives a grid of 6-term exact sequences: 3 "horizontal" sequences and 3 "vertical" sequences, forming a torus-like diagram with 18 groups and 36 maps. Commutativity of 16 out of 18 squares follows from naturality of functors $K_0$, $K_1$ the index map $\delta_1$ and exponential map $\delta_0$. Two squares remain, and it seems, that they are "anti-commutative", but I didn't manage to prove this. These squares are the following. 

Suppose, for simplicity, that $N=\infty$, so you are just taking values from a distribution. In order to answer your question, you should have some prior knowledge about this distribution (i.e. a probability distribution in the space of all distributions). I will give you two examples of this. Example 1: Suppose, you are doing (many times) some experiment, which has 2 results: 0 or 1. You don't know the probability p of "1", any value $p$ from 0 to 1 is possible. Then you can formalize your knowledge as the following: $p$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. Suppose, that after a few experiments you have got the sequence w="1010110111", you can write the formula, for a posterior density $f(p)$ of $p$. In general, if you have $n$ zeros and $m$ ones then $$f(p)=\frac{(1-p)^np^m}{\int_0^1(1-p)^np^mdp}=\frac{1}{n+m+1}\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\n+m\end{pmatrix}(1-p)^np^m.$$ This formula is just a continuous version of Bayes' theorem Because mean of the result of experiment is exactly $p$, the formula, written above, is exactly formula for the distribution, you are searching for. If w="1010110111", then n=3, m=7 and this distribution looks like this: 

Here is an example: Sullivan's analogy (or dictionary) between complex dynamics and Kleinian groups. 

G(n,p) We are familiar with the standard notion of random graphs where you fixed the number n of vertices and choose every edge to belong to the graph with probability 1/2 (or p) independently. This model is referred to as G(n,1/2) or more generally G(n,p). Random graphs with prescribed marginal behavior Now, suppose that rather than prescribe the probability for every edge, you presecribe the marginal probability for every induced subgraph H on r vertices. (So r should be a small integer, 3,4,5, etc.) You make the additional assumptions that a) the probability $p_H$ does not depend on the identity of the r vertices, and b) It depends only on the isomorphism type of $H$. So, for example: for r=3 you can think about the case that $p_H = 1/9$ if H is a triangle or an empty graph and $p_H=7/54$ otherwise. Once these $p_H$ are assigned you consider among all the probability distributions with these marginal behavior (if there are any) the one with maximal entropy. (But this choice is negotiable; if there is something different worth doing this is fine too.) My questions: 1) Are these models studied in the literature? 2) When are such $p_H$'s feasible? 3) Given such feasible $p_H$'s say on graphs with 4 vertices, is there a quick algorithm to sample from the maximal-Entropy distribution which will allow to experiment with this model? Background This question is motivated by a recent talk by Nati Linial in our "basic notion" seminar on extremal graph theory. (Maybe these are well studied models that I simply forgot, but I don't recall it now.) 

Suppose $N=\|(I+K)^{-1}\|$. In order to calculate $N$ one can do the following. Write $$N^2= \\|(I+K)^{-1}(I+K^\*)^{-1}\\| = \\|(1+K+K^\*+K^\* K)^{-1}\\| = 1/(1+\lambda),$$ where $\lambda$ is the smallest eigenvalue of $K+K^\*+K K^\*$. Try to calculate it using your explicit formulas. 

I've tried to fit a $n(x)$ by $\Re(f(x))$ with $f(x)=1+\sum_i\frac{c_i^2}{x-a_i-i b_i^2}$ with $c_i,a_i,b_i\in \mathbb{R}$. Here is the result of the fitting: 

I don't know the answer, just some thoughts. Suppose you have $n$ vertices of the first type and $l$ of the second. Of course, you know the answer if there is no restriction on the number of edges (you want it to be odd). Therefore equivalently I can calculate cases, when it is odd with coefficient (-1) and cases, when it is even with coefficient 1 (I denote this amount by $N$). Let $y_1,\dots,y_n,z_1,\dots,z_l$ be elements of $\mathbb{Z}\_2=\mathbb{Z}/(2\mathbb{Z})$, corresponding to the vertices of the graph. Edges are given by $n\times l$ matrix $A$. Then $N$ is the coefficient of $h^m$ in $S(h,h)$, where $S$ is defined by $$S(h,g)=\sum_{y\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^n,\;z\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^l} h^{|y|} g^{|z|} (-1)^{\sum_{i,j}y_i A_{ij} z_j}.\tag{1}$$ Here $|y|$ is amount of components in $y\in \mathbb{Z}\_2^n$ which are equal to $1$. One can get rid of the sum over $y\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^n$ in the following way: $$S(h,g)=\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^l} g^{|z|}\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1+h(-1)^{\sum_j A_{ij} z_j}).\tag{2}$$ This for example solves the problem in two cases: 1. we fix the number of vertices only in one part of a bipartite graph and the map $\mathbb{Z}_2^l\to\mathbb{Z}_2^n\colon z\mapsto x$ with $x_i=\sum_j A_{ij} z_j$ is surjective (in this case we can omit $g^{|z|}$ in $(2)$, make described change of coordinates and apply again the trick we used to get (2) from (1)); 2. amount of vertices in one part of a bipartite graph is small enough (in this case the sum (2) has small enough number of terms and each of them can be calculated in a polynomial time); 

Graphs which are stress-free for a generic embedding into space is an interesting class of graphs that includes all planar graphs. One thing to notice is that edges of maximal planar graphs with n vertices do not form the set of bases of a matroid. (Still maximal planar graphs have one pleasant property of matroids that they all have the same number of edges 3n-6.) There are related matroids defined on edge sets of complete graphs on n vertices: the most well known is the matroid described by generic rigidity of spacial embeddings. Gluck proved that planar graphs are generically 3-rigid, and this result is based on Dehn-Alexandrov's theorem asserting that (embedded) graphs of simplicial 3-polytopes are infinitesimally rigid. 

$$q^{-[n/2]/2}\sum_{k=0}^{[n/2]}(-1)^k \sum X_{j_1}\dots X_{j_{n-2k}},$$ where the second sum is over sequences $0=j_0,j_1,\dots ,j_ {n-2k},j_{n-2k+1}=n+1$ such that $j_0< j_1< \dots< j_ {n-2k}< j_{n-2k+1}$ and $j_{l+1}-j_l$ is odd for $l=0,\dots,n-2k$. Is not this a simple expression you are searching for? 

P.S. Here is a proof I came up with after some trial and error. We would like to define $F=f(PP^*)$, where $f(x)=0$ if $x=0$ and $f(x)=1$ otherwise. To check, that $F$ is well-defined we need to check, that $f$ is continuous on the spectrum of $PP^*$. To do this it is enough to show, that the open interval $(0,1)$ doesn't intersect with its spectrum or, equivalently, that $(2PP^*-1)^2\geq 1$. Expanding we see, that this is equivalent to $PP^*PP^* \geq PP^*$. Define $A=P-P^*$. Then $A^*A\geq 0$. On the other hand expanding we get $A^*A=PP^*+P^*P-P-P^*$, so $PP^*+P^*P\geq P+P^*$. Multiplying by $P$ on the left and by $P^*$ on the right we get $PP^* + PP^*PP^*\geq 2 PP^*$ or $PP^*PP^*\geq PP^*$. Thus $F=f(PP^*)$ is indeed well defined. Since $f(x)$ is real valued and $f(x)=f(x)^2$ we have $F=F^*=F^2$. To show, that $FP=P$ notice, that $f(x)x=x$ for $x\geq 0$. Therefore $FPP^*=PP^*F=PP^*$ and $(FP-P)(FP-P)^*=(F-1)PP^*(F-1)=0(F-1)=0$. Thus indeed $FP=P$. Thus we have $$P=F+(P-F)=F+F(P-1).$$ Finally, notice, that $(P-1)F=(P-1)PP^*F=0P^*F=0$, so $P-1=(P-1)(1-F)$ and $$P=F+F(P-1)(1-F).$$ 

This is a natural question and indeed the property of being intersecting is quite interesting also in various aspect of influences. However, you cannot improve KKL's theorem if f is intersecting: An example is this: consider your variables on a circle and let f=1 if the longest run of 1's is larger than the longest 1's of 0's and in case of equality consider the second longest run (and continue lexicographically). In this case f is intersecting and the influence of every variable is logn/n. This example is symmetric under rotations and therefore all influences are the same. The sum of influences can be described as the integral over all configurations x of h(x) the number of pivotal variables. Here a variable is pivotal if changing its value changes the value of f. Given x with f(x)=1 typically a variable is pivotal only if it belongs to the largest run which is of expected size logn. There are cases of equality (between 1 runs and 0 euns or between two runs) that the number of pivotal variables will be larger than log n but those are rare. This explains why every influence is proportional to logn/n but for a complete proof some more work is needed. 

You can do a bit better than the bound in Dan's reply. For a sufficiently small $\varepsilon$, consider the polynomial $g= f^2-\varepsilon$. Note that the zero set of $g$ has at lest one connected component inside of every cell of ${\mathbb R}^n\setminus M$. Thus, the Milnor-Thom theorem gives the upper bound $d^n$. The above bound is asymptotically tight. By taking $f$ to be the product of $d$ linear expressions of the form $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n+b$ you get that $M$ is the union of $n$ hyperplanes. When these hyperplanes are generic, it is not difficult to show that ${\mathbb R}^n\setminus M$ consists of at least $cd^n$ compoenets, for some constant $c$. If you would like to have a more well-behaved polynomial, you can again replace $f$ with $g= f^2-\varepsilon$. 

A favorite example of this kind for me is the result that the set of triangulations of an n gon (or, equivalenty, the set of interpretations of the nonassociative product $x_1x_2\dots x_{n-1}$) has the structure of a convex (n-1)-dimensional polytope. (It is called the associahedron or the Stasheff Polytope.) This looked (to me) as a curiosity at first but it turned out to be very basic and natural construction which is related to a lot of exciting mathematics. See Ziegler's lecture on the associahedron. 

In computational complexity there are several conjectures which are stronger than $NP \ne P$ which have important consequences. To mention a few 1) The conjecture that factoring is computationally hard is the basis to much theoretical and practical cryptography. 2) More broadly the conjecture that one-way functions exist has many consequences. 3) The conjecture that the polynomial hierarchy ($PH$) does not collapse has many consequences. 4) Khot's unique game conjecture has many important consequences for hardness of approximation. 5) The exponential time hypothesis ($ETH$)and strong exponential time hypothesis ($SETH$) are strong form of $NP \ne P$ with important consequences. 6) There are stronger and stronger versions of the "derandomization" conjecture with many consequences. 

Not a good fitting :(. This is actually why I ask this question. But note, I haven't used the data I have for k(x). Let's check, how is it approximated by $\Im(f(x))$ (with coeffitients from the previous fitting). 

This is not a complete answer, but a collection of observations (mainly about part (1)), which may be useful for the problem. Let's denote maximal determinant with $D_n$. Case $n=1$ is a trivial exceptional case, where determinant is uniformly distributed on $[a,b]$. So we can assume, that $n\geq 2$. In this case the minimal value of determinant is $-D_n$, because we can always permute two rows. Moreover, by the same reason, the distribution of the determinant is symmetric with respect to 0. Lemma: the answer to 1 has the form $D_n = (b-a)^{n-1} \max_i (c_i a + d_i b)$, where $c_i,d_i$ are some integers, $i=1,\dots,i_{max}(n)$. Proof: First, note, that the determinant is linear in each of matrix elements. Therefore any local (and hence global) maximum and minimum will be achieved for the extremal values of the elements. That is, we can assume, that each matrix element is either $a$ or $b$. Let $A$ be such a matrix. Do the following:
