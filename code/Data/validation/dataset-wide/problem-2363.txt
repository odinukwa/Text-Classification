A good set of poles should last a lifetime, so don't be afraid to spend a few extra bucks on a better model. If you're about to be attacked by an animal or you start sliding towards a cliff, you'll be glad you didn't trust your life to the cheapest thing you could find. 

I'm not familiar with your specific tent, but you typically don't block ventilation in a double walled tent. The outer rain fly will collect condensation from your own breathing and the tent needs to breath to reduce it. You also need to seal the seams on a tent if the factory doesn't do it for you, and sometimes even when they do. You can find lots of products for this, including McNett Seam Grip (no affiliation): 

Each person is unique and may need one feature over another. But here is my take on the features in a rough order of importance: 

Builders typically get Tyvek in 9' rolls instead of 4' and 5' sheets. You may be able to buy a small piece off of the roll from your local building supply store or find some waste at a local construction site so that you don't have any seams to join. If you do need to join two sheets of Tyvek, Tyvek Tape is specifically designed for sealing the joints when applied to a house. It's waterproof and adheres well. It's also quite strong, but similar to packing tape, once punctured it can tear easily. 

The most important part is to agree on a strategy beforehand and to not continue forward when you're injured, lost, or disoriented. A typical strategy might be: Each hiker to go at their own pace to that day's destination. The first group there gets to setup camp so the slower hikers aren't trying to do too many things, like hanging their bear bag, in the dark. Every individual (or at least subgroup) should have enough to survive a few days alone in their own backpack. Everyone should also have a small first aid kit and a way to signal to others, e.g. a whistle. If anyone becomes lost, they should immediately stop, get their bearings, and begin hiking back to the prior day's location. Once there, they shouldn't move for the next day. On the morning after someone fails to make it to a way point, the group should organize a search and always travel in pairs or greater. If there are too few people to leave someone at the camp, then a note should be left. Anyone that remains at the site should have a predefined time to begin backtracking. The first priority of the search party should be to get to the last known way point. If the lost hikers cannot be found there or enroute, a pair of hikers should return to civilization to report the missing hikers and any pairs remaining can begin searching in any obvious paths in an organized fashion. Predefined signals are important. E.g. with the whistle, 3 long blasts is a standard emergency call, 2 long blasts could be "I'm lost, but otherwise ok", 1 long blast could be "I'm searching, stay put", and 1 short blast could be "I'm here, reply back with your location". Rocks can be placed in a row on side trails to indicate that a search party is currently down that trail. And note paper to leave messages at each way point are handy to indicate who went where, and when. 

You need to use rope specific to the knots' purpose. It does no good to practice a fisherman's knot on hemp or climbing rope, when fishing line is expected. You'll never understand the nuances of the knot if you do otherwise. Bends tend to require ropes of different sizes and/or materials. If you were to practice basic Boy or Girl Scout knots, then yes, any rope you have is a good start: hemp, clothesline, para cord, climbing. But once you start practicing with knots who have specialized purposes, you need to practice with the rope they're intended to be used with. You didn't specifically mention "splicing", but here, the best rope to practice with is Â¼" hemp. Such beginner practice will inevitably require the entire train commute home :-) 

All cutting should be done on a steady wood base to protect against cutting into the ground and hitting rocks or roots which can damage and dull the cutting tools, and which can reduce bounce-back if you strike it the wrong way For large pieces of wood (5" or more, depending on your strength, stamina, wood quality, and wood type), you might have best luck starting out with a mallet and splitting wedge. If you don't have a splitting wedge, start cutting large pieces from the outside working your way inward. Lean wood against (or stand it atop) the steady wood base Avoid the temptation to use a hammer to the back of an axe or hatchet to cut. Heads can be brittle and shatter. A hammer (or rubber mallet) might be used to help dislodge a stuck head 

This is how we teach our scouts: When cutting, your primary tool will be an axe (held with two hands) or hatchet (held with one hand), but a bow saw and splitting wedge can also be used. This focuses mainly on the former two. 

Do a head count before you enter the cave, and be sure of the names of each caver Do a periodic head count while inside the cave - for example, every hour - and be sure you can touch the person whose name whom you call out. It's not enough to ask them to say "here!" because they can be several yards away and be missed. And it's not good enough for a proxy to say "yeah, he was just here with me". Do a head count by name when you exit the cave Each person - not just the group leader - should indicate to a friend or family of their plans: when they're heading out, where they're going, and when they plan to return. That friend or family member should expect contact indicating that they've safely exited the cave. This is no different than going hiking above ground: leave a hiking plan with a trusted person who can call for help if you do not respond when expected to. 

Do hang the food (or use a bear can, etc.) In my experience, wild animals are not deterred by dogs very much. A bear that lives close to humans might even be attracted to dogs: dogs frequently have dog food with them. Not exactly on topic, but I have woken up to deer approaching my camp, while my large dog was barking her head off. They only stopped advancing when the human stood up. 

follow up (edited again - note that the question does not say the person is lost, just trying to get rescued) My answer sounds flippant, but seriously, if you can't move or send info out, it's useless. Maybe MacGyver could turn the GPS into a transmitter, but can you? You can use the batteries & wires to makes sparks, or maybe use the screen as a signaling mirror. Or, if it has an illuminated screen, use that as a signal at night. Other than that, your GPS is as useful as a brick. 

BTDT I think, but I don't remember ever having a 'problem'. As a guy who camps and also gets to use squatty potties once in a while, here's my advice: First, ditch the shorts/pants it'll be much more comfortable to squat. Second, the ground doesn't splash as much as a bowl full of water, so the problem probably isn't as bad as you might think. Third, if your cathole is located on a slight slope you'll probably be able to get quite close too it, helping contain problems. A nice benefit of this - less strain on the ankles. Fourth - you can pile up the dirt from the hole near your feet, as extra protection. Fifth -by the time you hike out, whatever's on your boots will be long gone. And final bonus comment - the backwoods is a place to enjoy, not to find out whether you can survive on questionable food choices. Eat food that you would eat in everyday life, cooked properly, and enjoy your trip! 

This isn't a scientific evidence based answer, but I think that line should not be changing much, as it should have more to do with snow cover than temperature. This article on the history of snow fall in the Sierras, asserts that there has been no change in snowfall over 130 years despite a change in temperatures. This isn't too surprising as air carries more moisture when warm, and the Sierras are known to getting a lot of powder (aka Sierra cement) days late in the season. Also note from the chart that there aren't very many 'average' years, it's feast or famine. The years with heavy snowfall might mean six months of snow cover, maybe that's too long for a rattle snake to wait for breakfast? Related trivia: The Tahoe basin remains rattle snake free (last time I checked) despite being theoretically in their range. The lake is about 6200 feet, with many passes well below 9000 on all sides, plus the Truckee River canyon going right down to known rattle snake territory (Reno). In a heavy snow year virtually all of the basin will have snow cover, nearly down to lake level, from December to March, with more snow in April and May. 

One downside I've recently found out is that some hammock use can violate Leave No Trace policies. If you aren't careful about the rig you use to hang the hammock, you could injure the trees. The wider the strapping around the tree, the better for the tree. I suppose this doesn't mean all hammocking is bad for LNT, but it is common to hang a hammock with ripcord or similar such rope, and that's supposed to be no good for most trees. Some of the boy scout camps we go to mention this, although so far none prohibit use. It's also part of our leadership training. As a result, the scouts are recognizing some downsides but which can be mitigated with better equipment and training. It is interesting to note that the BSA is also promoting the concept, and some troops are reporting complete conversion to hammock-only camping. Consider: 

Note: You asked about timing. That depends on your skill, stamina, quality of tools, type of wood, condition of wood, and thickness of wood. New pieces of oak will take forever to cut through; old pine can be a breeze to go through. If you don't have a splitting wedge, that can sap time and endurance as you slog through a large piece. You asked about youngest age to cut. That depends on each child; physical capability is important, as is maturity, and each person is different. We don't teach Paul Bunyan requirements to anyone younger than 14 and all must demonstrate some degree of physical conditioning. Those who are 11 and up, and mature enough, can use a hatchet and saw under supervision. Keep a first aid kit handy, though. 

I tried to research your question, but could find no information - credible or otherwise - which would suggest a deliberate behavior. So, my answer is just a guess. First off, Canada geese feed by dipping their head under water to feed on vegetation. As others said, this action can create enough surface movement as to prevent the water from freezing. But my observations of local Canada geese say otherwise: we're experiencing temps in the single-digits over the last several weeks, and the geese are happily playing (?) on the ice of a normally slow-moving river. So wherever they're getting their food from is anyone's guess - but it's definitely not from underneath the water. If you're seeing the geese in cold weather, then you're seeing the urban-adaptive nonmigrating Canada geese, and, that means, they've found ways to adapt by eating and nesting in ways that are different than their migratory brethren. So, to answer your question, I would say "they could - but only for more warmer cold climates, and not at all for very cold climates". To suggest "they would" suggests an instinctive action on their part, and I haven't seen any information to support this. You mentioned it is a local park pond. If the pond is artificially fed via a pipe below, that could be the reason that the water moves above and does not freeze over. It could also be that the pond feeds the pipe for local use. In this case, artificially moving the water using bubble machines could be in use (like that used on the sides of boats that are moored in fresh water to prevent freezing along side it). One last thought on why there would be a hole in the ice (which I realize is not what you asked) is, maybe there is runoff from local streets? This would add salt to the water, if your area does salting in the winter. This could create a salinity in the water that is both agreeable to the Canada goose, as well as make that part of the water less able to freeze. When that saline water is diluted as it mixes with the fresher water away from that entry point, that water can freeze. Living with Wildlife - Canada Geese Somewhat unrelated to your question, I found that the name of the bird is actually "Canada goose" (branta canadensis), and use of "Canadian goose" suggests its citizenship! LOL The link here gives examples and counter examples of other species' names, and shows why language (especially English), in my opinion, is a stupid form of communication... Canada (or Canadian?) geese
