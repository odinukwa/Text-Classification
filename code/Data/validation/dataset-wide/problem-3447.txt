Suppose, there are 100 banks in a country. 50 of them are government owned. What would be the possible effect on a country's economy if private banks are declared as non-profit? I.e. they can not show any profit. If they have any profit, they must return that profit either to the government's treasury or spend in government's humanitarian projects. How would that affect or effect a country's economy? 

2008 - Pakistan seeks USD9 billion IMF bailout to avert crisis 2013 - Saudi Arabia come to Pakistan’s Rescue with USD15 Billion Energy Bailout Deal 2014 - Saudi Arabia loaned Pakistan USD1.5bn to shore up economy 2015 - IMF approves USD506 million for Pakistan under bailout programme 2017 - China bails out Pakistan with USD1.2bn loans 

This graph shows that South Korea, Malaysia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh started around the 1970s. Income of South Koreans rocketed while Malaysia and China seem like they couldn't live up to their potential, and Indo-Pak-Bangla are sitting at the bottom with no visible change. What is the basic problem of 3rd group I am talking about? 

Developed Economy = low human capital flight, good infrastructure, low corruption, high per-capita income, dominated by hi-tech industry, high expenditure in R&D, high-quality higher education, high-quality health care, and so on. Developing Economy = high human capital flight, bad infrastructure, high corruption, mediocre per-capita income, dominated by agriculture or service sector, not enough expenditure in R&D, low quality higher education, low life expectancy, and so on. What is the first sign that a country is transitioning from a developing to a developed economy? If we want to point to 'only one sign', what would that be? And, Why? 

Why is the price of goods higher in India than that of Germany with reference to people's income level? An employer is paying me such an amount of money (say,₹10,000 ≈ USD 152.52) which apparently looks larger, but in actuality, I am earning much lesser than that of a German guy (say, €1000 ≈ USD1173.96). Why am I earning less? 

Countries in the gulf are oil rich. But they are lagging in R&D sector. Governments do not spend much on R&D. Most countries employ foreign contractors or import technologies. What is the reason? 

Let $b_i\in\{0,B\}$ be $i$'s strategy. Then $i$'s payoff depends on the strategy profile $(b_i,b_{-i})$, where $b_{-i}=(b_j)_{j\ne i}$. \begin{equation} u_i(b_i,b_{-i})= \begin{cases} v_i&\text{if $b_i=0$ and $b_j=B$ for some $j\ne i$}\\ 0& \text{if $b_i=0$ and $b_j=0$ for all $j\ne i$}\\ v_i-B&\text{if $b_i=B$} \end{cases} \end{equation} Thus, $b_i=B$ is a best response if \begin{equation} u_i(B,b_{-i})\ge u_i(0,b_{-i}) \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad v_i-B\ge (1-\Pr(b_j=0,\;\forall j\ne i))v_i.\tag{1} \end{equation} Since the game is ex ante symmetric, we could further assume that every $i$ adopts a threshold strategy, i.e. \begin{equation} b_i=\begin{cases} 0&\text{if $v_i\le\overline v$}\\ B&\text{if $v_i>\overline v$} \end{cases}\tag{2} \end{equation} where $\overline v$ is some common threshold value. Then, the probability in $(1)$ can be written as \begin{equation} \Pr(b_j=0,\;\forall j\ne i)=\Pr(v_j\le \overline v,\;\forall j\ne i)=(\overline v)^{n-1},\tag{3} \end{equation} where the last equality is obtained from the assumption that $v_j$'s are i.i.d. and $v_j\sim U[0,1]$. Consolidating $(1)$ to $(3)$, we can solve for the cutoff value $\overline v=B^{1/n}$. 

The gap between $TS^*$ and $TS$ is the DWL. The inefficiency arises from the fact that, in equilibrium (with asymm info), some cars are in the wrong hands: the last 400 lemons sold and the potential 200 plums that were unsold. 

Let $F$ and $G$ be two distributions with the same mean. $F$ is said to second order stochastically dominate (SOSD) $G$ if $$\int u(x)\mathrm dF(x)\ge \int u(x)\mathrm dG(x)\tag{1}$$ for all increasing and concave $u(\cdot)$. This above definition is equivalent to $$\int_{-\infty}^x F(t)\mathrm dt\le \int_{-\infty}^xG(t)\mathrm dt,\qquad\forall x\in\mathbb R.\tag{2}$$ I was told that the requirement for $F$ and $G$ to have the same mean is not really necessary. Suppose $F$ and $G$ do not have the same mean. Can we then still have the equivalence between $(1)$ and $(2)$? N.B. I was able to show $(2)\Rightarrow (1)$ without the same mean condition, but not the other way around. 

Converting my comment to an answer... I suppose the expression you wrote is almost correct, except perhaps for a notational issue. I would write $u(x,y)=[w(x,y)]^{-1}$, because $w^{-1}(x,y)$ is usually used to denote the pre-image of $w(x,y)$. More generally, inverse proportionality between $u$ and $w$ is defined up to a multiplicative constant $K$; that is, $u(x,y)\cdot w(x,y)=K$ for some $K\in\mathbb R$. In the above case, you implicitly assumed $K=1$. So generally, you'd have $$ u(x,y)=K[w(x,y)]^{-1}=\frac{K}{w(x,y)}. $$ 

There are no identical business plans. You have to adequate yours to your idea. A quick example: When there is a physical product, you must include the design, explain it, whys and why not. When there is a service, for instance, perhaps it is better to explain why is it different than other solutions (you know, reinventing the wheel, not inventing it). I hope these will help you work something around. 

There are many online. I don't recommend any of them, unless you're looking for a structure to guide you through. Business plans must suit the idea, and not otherwise. You can find generic templates out there, but I believe they should work as a guidelines - i.e., things you should include. But the point of a business plan is to explain everything about an idea/project and explore the outcomes from there. If you are able to explain every single detail of your idea, you'll find some weaknesses - which you must include, of course - and your exercise is now to think about how can you over come those weaknesses. Some questions for you to consider: 

From the equation, if $L$ rises, everything else equals, then $u_n$ will rise (that is, the fraction will be smaller). $Y_n$ will also rise and that is a fairly reasonable conclusion - Extra work force will lead to more outputs. Now, the misleading conclusion is in regard to the markup. Consider now the labour market. When demand (work force) increases and all else remains equal (supply side - firms offering job opportunities), wages will lower and thus that setup will have a new equilibrium - with lower wages and more work force. This is my interpretation of your question, although the answer may not be 100% accurate, or an answer that actually answers your question. 

I find them both easy to read and understand concepts, mainly the first one. When I first had to work with it, my common problem was with the math, but if your background is in Physics, I'm sure you'll have no problems understanding the functions transformations. Coursera also has some courses that slightly approach Industrial Economics, like this one, but I guess this will not suffice to you. 

There's no a priori reason that points on the UPF should equal to the sum of individual utilities, since utility is ordinal (unless assumed otherwise). It may be that the square root utility chosen for this question is what's causing the result. But I haven't done the math to verify it. 

There are strictly dominated strategies and weakly dominated strategies. Strictly dominated strategies have payoffs always lower (i.e. "$<$") than another strategy that dominates it. Weakly dominated strategies have payoffs always no higher (i.e. "$\le$") than another strategy that dominates it. You example features $L$ as a weakly (not strictly) dominated strategy. 

There's the well known step-by-step guide on "How to build an economic model in your spare time" by Hal Varian. Edit Based on further clarifications made in the comments that OP's interest is in behavioral, I'd recommend The Foundations of Behavioral Economic Analysis by Sanjit Dhami. The book covers, comprehensively, the various models in behavioral economics and how they are justified and applied. From the publisher: 

The utility function is concave, but the preference that the function represents is convex. It seems you're confusing between the convexity of two different objects. 

With more revenue and less cost, the monopolist will simply not be content at operating on the inelastic segment of the demand. 

So, Player 2 has four (pure) strategies: $\{AA, AB, BA, BB\}$. In comparison, since Player 1 only moves at one information set (at the beginning), her actions and strategies are identical: $\{L,R\}$. To represent this game using the normal/strategic form, we'd have It's not a 2-by-2 game, but 2-by-4, precisely because strategies and actions are not the same. Lastly, a note on Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) and other similar one-shot simultaneous-move games. If you consider the extensive form of PD, you'd see that each player moves at only one information set, and so their set of actions and set of strategies coincide (just like Player 1 in the above example). This is why you can use the two terms interchangeably in those games. 

The fact that "she knows her type" and therefore has no need to calculate an expected payoff presupposes that the play has reach a particular information set for player 2. Formally, let $\theta\in\{R,B\}$ be P2's type. Her utility conditional on her type being $\theta$ is \begin{equation} u_2(\sigma_1,\beta_2(\color{red}{\theta})\vert\color{red}{\theta}). \end{equation} where $\beta_2(\theta)$ is P2's behavior strategy at the information set associated with $\theta$ (i.e. the left decision node for P2 when $\theta=R$ and the right decision node for P2 if $\theta=R$). Here, no expected value is calculated since the uncertainty is resolved for P2. In contrast, in the normal form representation, P2's utility is an unconditional one: \begin{equation} u_2(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\Pr(R)u_2(\sigma_1,\beta_2(R)\vert R)+\Pr(B)u_2(\sigma_1,\beta_2(B)\vert B) \end{equation} where expectation is to be taken. The reason is that by converting an extensive form game into the normal form, the temporal aspect of the game is lost and everything is seen from the ex ante perspective. 

I believe your understanding of budget and GDP is a bit off. Comparing debt with GDP is more adequate, as GDP measures the country's production level, while budget is just an estimate. At least where I live, what is budgeted for the upcoming year is not always accomplished in the end, as there are gaps and things that missed the planning phase. In that case, it makes a bit more sense to compare what the country owes (debt) with what it is actually producing, rather than with what it estimates to produce, don't you think? I'm not exactly sure, but I believe GDP aggregates indirect revenues, while revenue size does not - hence looking more serious. 

You should seek for topics under Industrial Economics then. I have these books has reference (see below list). Keep in mind that Industrial Economics is highly focus on competition and market power. 

Deriving those functions, you can find $p^*$ and $Q^*$, which, multiplying both, should give you equilibrium profits. Now, if you take that tax rate (20%, I reckon?), you can calculate taxes over profits and the tax-free price. To find the equilibrium price $p^*$, you need to have those two functions in a system and solve for $p$. Then, just replace it on both functions and you should have equilibrium quantities. Now, I'm assuming demand absorves all quantities produced by companies, no production restrictions and that this market is one in perfect competition. If this last paragraph changes, then my solution will not be correct. To answer your question - what is the difference -, well, in this case, it is none because we are not considering production costs. If we did, you can see that both values would change. Nevertheless, to calculate taxes, you need to work around with the system. That will give you total revenues, cost and tax free. Applying 20% leads to net earnings, because you do not have any production costs associated with the problem - something commonly done in Economics. That or consider a variable $c$ of costs. This kind of exercises are also good to understand what are the effects of costs on revenues/profits. There's actually a financial term for that but I cannot recall :)
