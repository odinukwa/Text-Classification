I hope it is clear that this process is reversible. (In reverse: while the endpoint is above the $x$-axis, translate the path two units down, then take the initial segment from $(0,-2)$ to the first intersection with $y=-1$ and reflect this initial segment about that line.) Putting it together Now we have all the ingredients we need. Let us count the pairs of paths as described above. Since $n$ and $c$ have the same parity, we may write $n=i+j$ and $c=i-j$ for $i\in[0,a]$, $j\in[0,b]$. 

Question. Do these identities involving even-index Catalan numbers have a known combinatorial interpretation? They look as though they should. I haven’t seen one in the literature. $$\sum_{a+b=n}C_{2a}C_{2b}=4^nC_n$$ $$\sum_{a+b=n}C_{2a}{4b\choose 2b}=4^n{2n\choose n}$$ 

The claim of Lemma 1 should presumably be read in the context of the global assumption in Paulhus's paper that $w\leq l$. This assumption invalidates the instance I wanted to use (i.e. $l=\frac12$, $w=1$). The proof of the lemma seems flawed, as mentioned below and succinctly summarised in Yoav Kallus’s comment. Another example where the packing constructed for the proof does not fit is $l = \frac{9}{5}$, $w = \frac{7}{9}$, $n=2$, which I mention only since (unlike the example below) it has $w<l$. 

A path of $n$ steps from $(0,0)$ to $(c,2k)$ that does not cross the line $y=2k$, which we can think of as a 180° rotation of a path from $(0,0)$ to $(c,2k)$ that does not cross the $x$-axis; A path of $a+b-n$ steps from $(c,2k+1)$ to $(a-b,2k+1)$, which we can think of as a translation of a path from $(0,0)$ to $(a-b-c,0)$. 

Are there two rational points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on the unit circle such that the numbers $y_1 + y_2$ and $y_1 - y_2$ are also the y-coordinates of rational points on the unit circle, except where $y_1$ or $y_2$ is zero? Are there are three distinct double points on the unit circle whose y-coordinates are in arithmetic progression, other than the trivial case where the middle one is on the x-axis? Are there two double points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on the unit circle such that $y_1 + y_2$ is also the y-coordinate of a double point on the unit circle, excluding the trivial case where one of $y_1$, $y_2$, $y_1+y_2$ is zero? Are there three distinct rational points on the unit circle whose y-coordinates are in arithmetic progression, where the common difference of this arithmetic progression is also the y-coordinate of a rational point on the unit circle, other than the trivial case where the middle point is on the x-axis? 

What about definitions that are elegantly concise to such an extent that they confound intuition? A classic of the genre: 

This is clearly a bijection. There are ${i+j\choose i}^2$ paths of $(i+j)$ steps from $(0,0)$ to $(i-j,0)$. The four directions N,S,E,W may be obtained by starting with $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}-1\\0\end{smallmatrix}\right]$ and adding neither, one, or both of $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}1\\1 \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ and $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}1\\-1\end{smallmatrix}\right]$. Build a path of $i+j$ steps, initially all $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}-1\\0\end{smallmatrix}\right]$. Add $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}1\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right]$ to $i$ of the steps and, independently, add $\left[\begin{smallmatrix}1\\-1\end{smallmatrix}\right]$ to $i$ of the steps. There are also ${i+j\choose i}^2$ paths of $(i+j)$ steps from $(0,0)$ to $(i-j,\geq0)$ that do not cross the $x$-axis. There is a bijection between these paths and the paths of the previous section using a raising/lowering transformation [GKS]. Suppose we have a path from $(0,0)$ to $(i-j,0)$ that may cross the $x$-axis. 

(There must be a guard in each of the grey triangles, and there are $k$ disjoint such triangles, so we need at least $k=\frac n3$ guards.) The problem, then, is to place no more than $\lfloor\frac n3\rfloor$ guards into a simple polygon with $n$ vertices in such a way that one of the guards can see any point in the interior of the polygon. Fisk’s algorithm is as follows: triangulate the polygon to obtain a planar graph whose vertices are the vertices of the original polygon and whose faces are triangles, and then three-colour the vertices so each face has a vertex of each colour. At least one of the three colours occurs $\leq\lfloor\frac n3\rfloor$ times: position guards at the vertices that are painted this colour. Since each triangle has a guard at one of its vertices, and a triangle is entirely visible from any one of its vertices, the whole of the polygon must be visible to at least one guard. Thus a difficult-sounding purely geometric problem is solved by three-colouring the vertices of a planar graph. 

Notes. I came across these identities while thinking about an unanswered question of Mike Spivey from 2012. I can define a bijection for the first one – I imagine the second can be done in a similar way – but it isn’t obviously a very nice bijection, and it uses Garsia-Milne involution. Here is a description of it, in the language of species. If $D$ is the species of Dyck paths with matching up/down pairs labelled (or binary plane trees with internal nodes labelled, etc.) then $D=1+XD^2$, where $1$ is the species of the empty set (sometimes denoted $E_0$) and $X$ is the species of singletons ($E_1$). Split $D=D'+D''$, where $D'$ represents paths of odd semilength and $D''$ even, so we have the mutually recursive isomorphisms $$\begin{align}\tag{1}D''&=1+2XD'D''\\\tag{2}D'&=X(D'^2 + D''^2)\end{align}$$ (using the $=$ sign to denote isomorphism). The aim is to define an isomorphism between $D''^2$ and $1 + 4X^2D''^4$. We shall do this by defining an isomorphism $$D''^2+Y=1 + 4X^2D''^4+Y$$ for the species $Y=(2XD'D'')^2$, and appealing to the Garsia-Milne principle. Here is the isomorphism, from right to left: $$\begin{align} 1 + 4X^2D''^4+Y&=1 + 4X^2D''^2(D'^2+D''^2)\\ &=1 + 4XD'D''^2\tag{using 2}\\ &=1 + 4XD'D''(1+2XD'D'')\tag{using 1}\\ &=1 + 4XD'D'' + 8(XD'D'')^2\\ &=D''^2 + 4(XD'D'')^2\tag{using 1}\\ &=D''^2 + Y \end{align}$$ 

These paths also have an interesting interpretation as NSEW lattice paths (where the set of steps is the four cardinal directions N, S, E, W). They correspond, under the usual bijection between one-dimensional paths of length $2k$ and two-dimensional paths of length $k$, to NSEW lattice paths from $(0,0)$ of length $n$ that intersect the $x$-axis only at positions with an even $x$-coordinate. In other words, to paths on the perforated plane obtained by removing (punching out) all the odd-numbered lattice points on the $x$-axis. 

Let $E_d$ be the group of rational points on the elliptic curve $$y^2=(x-d)x(x+d)$$ It is well-known – and easy to verify by elementary algebra – that $(x,y)\in E_d$ belongs to $2E_d$ precisely when all three of $x-d$, $x$, $x+d$ are squares. This seems too neat to be a mere coincidence. Is there a natural generalisation of this fact? Or a more conceptual way to understand why it ought to be true? 

From the abstract: It is well known (indeed, as Paul Erdős might have said, every child knows) that the rationals are countable. However, the standard presentations of this fact do not give an explicit enumeration; rather they show how to construct an enumeration. In this note we will explicitly describe a sequence $b(n)$ with the property that every positive rational appears exactly once as $b(n)/b(n + 1)$. 

When this identity was posted, it struck me as something that ought to have a combinatorial explanation. I have now found one, using a decomposition of NSEW lattice paths: paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ consisting of unit steps in the direction N, S, E or W. Many of the ideas here may be found in [GKS], though not the decomposition itself. The expression $\frac12{2a+1\ +\ 2b+1\choose2a+1}$ counts paths of $(a+b+1)$ steps that start at $(0,0)$ and end on the half-line $(a-b,\geq0)$. To see this, decompose each path step as two half-steps $±\left[\begin{smallmatrix}½\\½\end{smallmatrix}\right]$ and $±\left[\begin{smallmatrix}½\\-½\end{smallmatrix}\right]$. If the $+$ option is chosen for $(2a+1)$ of the $2(a+b+1)$ half-steps, and the $-$ option for the other $(2b+1)$, then the $x$-coordinate of the endpoint is $\frac12((2a+1)-(2b+1))=a-b$. Thus there are ${2a+1\ +\ 2b+1\choose2a+1}$ paths of $(a+b+1)$ steps from $(0,0)$ to $x=a-b$. By parity, the end position must have an odd-numbered $y$-coordinate. Reflection in the $x$-axis is therefore a fixpoint-free involution, so half of these paths end on the half-line $(a-b,\geq0)$. Such a path may be split into a pair of paths with $(a+b)$ steps in total. The endpoint of the path is $(a-b, 2k+1)$ for some $k\in\mathbb N$. At least one step of the path must therefore be an N step from $(c,2k)$ to $(c,2k+1)$ for some $c$. Remove the first such step, to give a pair of paths with $a+b$ steps altogether:
