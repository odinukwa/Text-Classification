You can measure a metre while having a bad idea about what should count as a metre. The standard for what counts as a metre has changed over time. It used to be defined in terms of a special type of metal bar under suitable conditions and is now set in terms of the speed of light. The metal bar standard was good enough for a lot of measurements but not good enough for some more recent measurements, see $URL$ The only question to ask about measurements in terms of the old standard is whether they require the accuracy of the new standard or not to test the ideas they were supposed to test. For example, if a biologist measures the length of a dolphin to presumably does not care about the length down to the last angstrom so then he shouldn't care about the change. Next you write: 

Free markets are necessary for production. If a person successfully bids for a piece of property, that means he has convinced people to give him the means to make that purchase and has convinced the seller to give him the property in exchange for the money. He has no means to get the money or the property but argument. If somebody else has a better use for the property they can bid it away from him. And if he tries and fails to make money with the property, he may lose it. Making a profit is a signal that people prefer what he is making to the other goods they could obtain with the same money. Without that signal he has no way to know whether he is providing good that people prefer to their other options. The alternative to this system is to squander and destroy resources, see $URL$ The current economic system in every modern economy is a mix of free market and interventionist and socialist policies. You can find lots of discussions of specific policies and problems at places like the Cato Institute. Taking this or that country as a pure example of socialism or capitalism is extremely misleading, except in some very extreme cases, such as North Korea. 

You should stop conflating people like Friedman with Ayn Rand. Friedman was far less consistent than Rand in his advocacy of freedom. So I'm going to address the sort of thing I think Rand would say. Also, Rand wasn't a libertarian in part because libertarianism is such a big tent that it includes people like Friedman who advocated anti-capitalist policies: Friedman advocated a negative income tax. Your example talks about a poor village 500 km from a pharmacy, where a child will die if he doesn't get the medicine in 24 hours. There is an old man who owns some of the medicine but doesn't want to give it over. You ask whether the authorities should make the old man give it over. I think there are several remarks one could make about this example. Let's start by clear about what you're advocating. When the authorities do anything, those who disobey the authorities' orders may be killed. If the old man doesn't want to hand over the medicine and refuses to open his door the authorities may bash it down. If he tries to defend his property they may kill him. So anyone who says the authorities should take the medicine are staking a position that implies it is okay to kill the old man to save the child. Now, suppose it really is the case that the old man doesn't want to hand over the medicine although he doesn't have much use for it. Well then his neighbours might think he is a bastard and they don't really want anything to do with him. So they might decline to trade with him. If they refuse to sell him food or clothing, then he might hand over the medicine. This doesn't require the authorities to do anything. Also, if the family concerned are good people, the neighbours might be willing to help them raise money to buy the drug. And if nobody will lift a finger to persuade the old man or subsidise the family voluntarily, you should be interested in why this is the case. You should be very cautious about using force in that situation. Some families have bad traditions and do bad stuff like theft, assault, murder etc. Also, if they don't have enough wealth for a medicine, perhaps they are layabouts who don't take responsibility for their lives. Forcing people to subsidise such behaviour is a bad idea. See, for example, the description of Starnesville in "Atlas Shrugged". Also, you don't say anything about the institutions in the village or the country in which is situated. For example, perhaps the village government or the central government is willing to pillage the belongings of anyone who is deemed wealthy. In that case, the old man might be endangering his life by supplying the medicine since this would indicate wealth. Such policies might also make it inadvisable for anyone to show off the wealth required to save the child, or to make that wealth in the first place. 

Most emotions and feelings are learned. They inexplicit knowledge learned in order to solve various problems to do with getting along with other people, and possibly for some aesthetic stuff too. If you do something that pisses off somebody else, then you and the other person has a problem. Should that person cooperate with you in future? If you are sorry then they might still be willing to cooperate with you in future because being sorry is conventionally taken as a sign the off-pissing act in question. Other emotions solve other problems like this. Some people think of moral problems solely in terms of their emotions. If the person feels pissed off with you, then that person may claim you were in the wrong regardless of the actual situation. This emotional way of dealing with problems has some flaws. First, people can pretend to feel an emotion when they don't. If you are interested in trying to explain what's going on rather than taking emotions at face value you might spot this. So thinking of morality in terms of emotions alone leaves you without a way to spot problems. Secondly, the emotions don't supply you with the knowledge necessary to solve moral problems. Hence the problem of the person who feels sorry for doing something but does it again anyway. What is needed is for him to think of a better way of living, not just a feeling of sorriness. Sometimes other people may not want to deal with you if you don't exhibit certain emotions because that's the only way they know of to deal with moral problems. They have no reason to change unless you explain your position properly, so they are not necessarily in the wrong. In addition, it is not enough for you to simply say you're not going to feel emotions or whatever. You would have to go to the trouble of replacing emotional ways of dealing with problems with non-emotional ways of solving problems. so deciding not to feel is not enough to actually stop feelings. Replacing emotions with better ideas may be worth doing in cases where your emotional way of dealing with a problem gets in the way of solving the problem. But in the absence of such problems there's no point in wrecking what works. See $URL$ $URL$ 

A political economic system is a set of ideas, habits and institutions that purport to solve problems when people deal with one another. For example, if I would like my house to be painted there are a number of potential solutions to that problem. I could get somebody else to do it. I could get paint and do it myself. I could change my preferences so that I no longer want my house painted. And there may be other solutions, e.g. - I should paint some rooms and not others. So there is a problem to be solved: how can I and other people come to agree on those issues that we have to agree on for me to paint my house or not paint it or whatever? The free market way to solve this problem is to allow people to bid for resources, like paint, ingredients for paint, a house painter's time and so on. If I can reach an agreement on resource X with its current owner, I will buy it, otherwise I will not. Marx pointed out what he thought were flaws in this way of doing things. Some people called capitalists paid other people to do stuff with equipment they owned. He alleged that the value of a particular item had something to do with the amount of labour people had done to make it. The capitalist wasn't working on whatever widget the worker made with his machinery, so he was exploiting the worker by getting some of the value of his labour. Now, if it was true that the value of an item is dependent on the amount of labour alone, then it would always have to be true. For if this were to change then there would have to be some explanation of the change and that explanation would contradict the labour theory of value because it would say that sometimes the labour doesn't determine the value. So there is no question of saying that Marx is right at some times and wrong at others. Either he is right or he is wrong and that does not change over time. However, as early as 1898 the economist Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk published a criticism of Marx's ideas pointing out lots of problems with them: $URL$ For example, not all work is the same. Would you pay a brain surgeon the same amount for an hour of his time as you would pay a cleaner? No. If you want a brain surgeon's services you're willing to pay a hell of a lot more than you would pay for a cleaner. There are other problems with Marx's ideas. Marx was in favour of violent revolution to replace what he claimed were bad systems of political economy:
