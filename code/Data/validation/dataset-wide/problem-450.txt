It seems you asked several question about multiple-body configuration. As there is no solution to such problems, simulators could be an option to test your models. You can try for example : 

If your bullet has a conventional shape, its energy will simply enable it to go through your target's body and maintain a very decent speed after this. So you can probably kill a bunch of people in one shot. If your bullet has an unconventional shape, it can become funny (except for the target) : 

You can. But there is competition in the area, with a nearly saturated market. Main competitors are the Abrahamic religions : Christians 2.07bil., Muslims 1.2bil., and a few other for a 3.35bil. total. Dharmic (mostly Hinduist and Budhist) are 1.2bil. Non-religious people are about 0.92bil (source Worldmapper). Now, your religion seems definitely a classical one, based on belief and faith, not verifiable, without any proof of its veracity. But this is definitely not an issue ; your competitors prove it. People are begging for answers to complex questions about themselves, about their own death, about their depressing and meaningless existence, about the place of mankind in this small muddy place turning around a second category star, in an universe incredibly vast, hostile, and merciless. Facing such reality is hard, so provide anything that can help people believe something better exist and they will run for it. Alcohol, drugs, psycho-active substances, are too clear workarounds. But structuring people's belief, that is shaping their perception so that the reality matches some distorted view that explains most of the observable reality but biased enough to provide happy answers, and you will have followers. Forever happiness, love that never disappear, are good starting points. You may want to enforce this love for the afterlife by creating hate of the current world, making people hate their bodies, their sexuality, their fantasies. Here and today will become places of the evil, of the enemy. Your religion must have an enemy, so that your followers have a common cause and a clear target. You can use scapegoating here, it usually works very well. Pacific and non-fighting minorities are good, provided they stand long enough to build up the required hatred. You can always change thereafter, as the main authority. Please tell use more, so that we can follow your progress ! 

Are there existing collaborative websites (or tools) for world building ? Examples of result could be very developed creations like $URL$ or roleplay universes. I do not need/want to create a website by myself (this topic is covered by other questions), but have feedback on existing tools, especially regarding the usability, the ways to manage the contributors (motivate and reward people) and the creation (reviews, votes on suggestions, etc.). 

First, hiding information about an alien item observable from earth is unlikely. Deep and far space observation is done for science purpose and not by the military, so the global policy is usually to share information. And a government trying to hide such information will lack a lot of credibility when it will become public. This is not an option for democracies. Military people will get nervous, as the number of unknown factors of the alien menace are high, and the technology level is likely to exceeds earth's one. They are very likely to ask for specific budgets to be able to deal with space warfare (which is currently underdeveloped if existing at all) and nuclear weapons (which are the best we can do regarding destruction). There may be suggestion to create defensive systems around Earth: thios start with basic orbital explosions to create debris fields, but this is rather desperate as human satellites will be impacted. Science guys will be excited ! What does alien biology or mathematics look like ? They are likely to try to propose a pacific Post-detection policy and try to understand as much as possible from all available information. But the fact that intelligent life exists already has lots of implications. Especially that if one alien life exists, there are probably lots. Religious people may be at pain if their religion is human-centric, which is often the case. However, religious guys are used to manage inconsistencies between belief and reality since centuries, so they should be able to deal with it. Some people may see the aliens as [representatives of] gods and create new specific cults. But that's just because we have the ability to create weird cults anyway. Expect suicidal guys, fanatics, etc. Politicians will lean toward the military as they are in charge of the defense of their citizen and countries. Some are likely to try to take advantage of the situation, like by establishing exclusive contact with the aliens, or try to have access to their technology first. Others will probably try to create big planetary global human alliances. From earth experience, the contact with a more advanced civilization usually brings no good to the less advanced one. Globally, the economics will freeze with such a high risk pending : people will recover their assets and prepare for the worst : food, weapons. Police and army will ensure no panic appears and emergency state is likely. Expect lots of funny TV shows to keep people busy watching. 

In both cases, stars are very bright and emit strong radiations, putting high pressure on lifeforms. Species will avoid exposure to direct sunlight and develop special protection mechanisms, like ADN-multiple replicas. In the unlikely case of a tidally-locked planet, the dawn area will be an interesting location, with reduced exposure but enough energy. Now, we have an issue regarding the lifespan of blue stars. Our earth is 4.6 billion years old. Simple cells appeared 1 billion year thereafter, closely followed (well, only 200 million years) by cyanobacterias which ruled the day. 1.5 billion years after this, multicellular life appeared. A blue star is unlikely to stay for that long, so your lifeforms are likely to be very primitive. 

Joker The ultimate hidden location: a black hole. While getting there is challenging, no information can come from it. 

A late answer, but as most other replies that essentially rely on devices, I would put emphasis on more knowledge-based elements. What about banking ? In the past, Jews were not forbidden by their religion to manipulate money, and they made great profit at it. Same goes for for the Knights of the Temple, who had the trust and a network that enabled the lending of money on a large scale. Understanding some fundamentals of economics may really help to make money. Note that in both cases, some powerful people desperate for gold may try to grab, like the king of France Philippe IV le Bel did. Cryptography may also provide help to powerful leaders, both to help confidentiality and break some (usually basic) codes used at that time. Labor division and organization would allow for proto-industrial development, event with the local energy (water mills). Medicine and basic understanding of the body may really help to give advice. Remember that sterilization is a relatively recent discovery. 

Problem is not with AI, but with humans. We manipulate a lot of concepts without defining them, but everybody has a rough idea about them and most of the time it is ok. If you throw an AI in this, things start to get weird. An example: You ask - somewhat naively - an AI to provide "Happiness for mankind". Happiness is not well-defined. Does it mean living forever ? If the AI can copy a brain or human consciousness and store it in a safe place, is that a "good" or "bad" things regarding happiness of the subject ? You hope that Mankind is clear ? Well... Does it include only living people ? Where do they begin to live ? If it includes dead people, do we try to resurect them ? What about future people ? How do we ensure they will born ? Must we maximize their number and make today's people have a tremendous birth rate ? Must we create a gigantic factory creating newborns ? AI have no sense of scale. Their objective goes beyond any other concern and that's why it has nefarious consequences. They will transform all the matter of the universe in a supercomputer to answer that question that they themselves are not able to solve. They will destroy mankind, earth, life, just to produce what you ask them for. Until we can model things like ethics to give it to AIs, they are a hazard and a good inspiration source for technology nightmares. 

Path 2 would not be my choice, but as a defender of lost cause I would like to make it a slightly better candidate so that it falls back in the race. In particular, you insist on the destructive scanning of the brain required to build a sim. If the destructive part is not a technical choice, but a fundamental issue because the reading require to be quantum-precise and breaks the original, then this option is the only viable one. Some theories relate consciousness and quantum physics. I do not buy it but it gives credibility to the scenario. And you could still have fun by mixing sims : like having half of the memory of A and half of the memory of B, and the emotions of C (and you would be able to tell what part of us depend of our memories, btw.). Damn russian hackers ! 

Warning: some well-intented authors heavily abuse the use of unknown words to make the writing more "exotic". The end result can however be hard to immerse in, with constant thinking like "What is this kagklgor beast the hero is jumping on again ? Is that the 6-legs horse thing ? Or the flying giant rat ?". The remark stand for names, locations, species, etc. Language being used by human to communicate with each other and transmit information, using meaningful words also has its advantages. Starting from a descriptive word combination, and subtly playing with it can be an option. An example is Stephen R. Donaldson using imager for some magi that get their power from images in mirrors. Isn't that simple and understandable ? For a comic example of what happens in you readers mind when abusing exotic names, enjoy this funny strip. [edit]As stated in the comment, xkcd provides a perfect illustration of the point: 

Combos are possible. Chasm and volcano match well together from a geological point of view. Permanent eclipse can also have effect on the crust and trigger geological activity. 

People won't care. At least, most of them will not. Most people do not enter resistance when their country is invaded, most people do not bother about damaging their ecosystem. As people eventually die[citation needed], they focus on self-preservation at an individual sort-term level rather than on a long-term global level as a specie. This self-interest implies that unless their very daily existence and comfort is threatened, you can expect that nobody will really care. People will continue their business as usual. If they can make money with your threat, it will even be better. Expect a few extreme behaviors from a minority that will not be happy with the mental pressure caused by the situation, and maybe some superstition, myths, or religions about this new threat. And finally, expect politics and people in situation of power to gather as much information on this threat so that they can use it for their interest. The underlying actions and competition may even cause the initially friendly aliens to react.
