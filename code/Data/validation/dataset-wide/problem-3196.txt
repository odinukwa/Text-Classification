Ukrainian nationalists formed the OUN, which worked from exile after WWII (mostly Germany but also the US). Soviet authorities alleged that the OUN supported or controlled anti-soviet partisans in the Ukraine in the immediate aftermath of WWII, this partisan activity ended in the early 1950ties. To cite German wikipedia on OUN: 

TL;DR: The Hussites were famous for using flails and sang during battle, and so a possilbe inspiration for Hugo. This is not really relevant to your question about scythes, but may shed some light on how this passage you quote came about: 

This also points to a problem with definig overpopulation: The "carrying capacity" will always depend on agricultural and other technologies used, consumption patters etc. Chaco Canyon, Anasazi & southwestern Native Americans, Maya: 

When I read the question, my first thought where leather bags or water-tight basket that you heat by placing hot stones from a fire inside, as was done by some great plains first nations. It seems, however, Inuit also used soapstone and clay cookware (I presume some still do, along stainless steel and china). Soapstone: 

My - entirely speculative - take is that, due the use of cornel as a synonym for spear, maybe spears made from any suitable wood where sometimes referred to as cornels, making if hard to know centuries later what actually was used and if cornel really was such astrategic supply. (Wikipedia on cornel) 

I think it likely that local Wehrmacht commanders wanted to take the city at one point or other, but ultimatley the grand strategy called for encircling and siege beforehand. Despite attempts to feed and evacuate the city via the frozen lake, a million civilians lost their lives. The conditions in the city were desperate, to put it very mildly. I think this question comes from looking at the siege of Leningrad as a purely military set piece, and sees just a baffling military decision to not take the city. I think you need to look at the political and economic goals of the Nazis, and at the immense suffering of the people in Leningrad. Further Details on the Hunger Plan can be found in Götz Aly's "Vordenker der Vernichtung" and Felix Wemheuer's "Der Große Hunger: Hungersnöte unter Stalin und Mao" Both should be available in english. If you read German, here's a lengthy excerpt about the Hunger Plan and the siege of Leningrad from the latter. 

In 1920, Alfred Erich Hoche and Karl Binding published "Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens" - "The permission to destroy life not worth living" (my translation). The main point that certain disabled people are a mere "ballast" on society and that there should be a mechanism to legally kill these people. They argued from an economic standpoint, not from a true eugenics standpoint - heridarity of conditions was not their focus. Still, this text was widely and positivly received by the eugenics movment in Germany. The economic argument for murder was later used by Nazis in implementing the euthanasia murders. during the 20ties and 30ties, there where eugenics movements in many countries around the world, and not all of them associated with the far right. Was the proposal by Binding and Hoche discussed in these movements (in their own press, at conferences etc.)? If so, can we say that the reception was rather critical, or approving of the proposed murders? 

The Nazis did not plan to capture Leningrad at this point. Rather, their plan was to drive many people into Leningrad and then starve them there, as laid out in the Hunger Plan. The Hunger Plan called for the mass murder of 20 million people via starvation. The wikipedia on the siege of Leningrad has also some details: 

My question is if there where other broader societal classes where people might have a similar scholarly training, or might even work as advisors or teachers. Possible literate classes could be merchants, clergy, or even slaves or servants if those served as teachers or scribes. 

I found a relevant passage in this (German language) booklet on women within Bundism. Note that his concerns the Rayon within Zarist Russia, I don't know if this is western enough for you. 

Easter Island: The case of easter island, deforestation is often seen as the primary cause of collapse: 

We could go on with the Armia Kraiova, greek partisans or the resistance (and maybe I'll do that later). For now my comclusion would be that access to guns matters, but not as much as having an organization that can sustain a prolonged struggle. Guns can - at great risk! - be obtained from enemies. In all cases listed above, guns owned prior to the war played a role only in the first phase of the resistance struggle & I can't say how big or small it was. 

Maybe not Joseph Tainter argues, in Archeology of Overshoot and Collapse, that so far there is no evidence of a Malthusian catastrophy. wetheryou follow Tainter in this assertion will in part depend on how wide or narrow your definition of overpopulation is. Problem with definition According to Malthus, population grows exponentially while food production grows linearily, until the first outstrips the latter. This definition of overpoulation is IMO overly narrow, as any case where food production drops would be excluded. As we see, in numerous cases food production would rise for a while and then collapse through environmental degradation or other causes. This overshoot theory is applied in the case studies below. Case studies Tainter adresses several cases commonly cited as overshoot, I'll cite only conclusions regarding the examples from Jared Diamonds Collapse: Henderson and Pitcairn Islands: 

Maybe not. This article makes no mention of archimedes pumps in the far east: Evolution of Water Lifting Devices (Pumps) over the Centuries Worldwide They also treat china and quote old (but not ancient) chinese technical manuals. 

So it appears integration into mainstream society was possible near the precarian bottom rungs or in the educated upper middle class, but not into the respectable working class. 

During the most infamous famines, the great famine of '32 in the Soviet Union and the Great Leap Forward in China, the rural population was hit the hardest: The state took away food from them for export (to pay for industrialisiation) and to feed the cities. One survival strategy that was tried, and worked sometime, was indeed to migrate into a city where rations where higher. Police and military tried to stop this (also to keep the famines a secret from the urban population) and succeeded for the most part, though. This is true for both China and the SU. The SU suffered several famines, most importantly immediately after WWI, during WWII and again shortly after WWII. In these cases, the city population was hit harder. Source: Felix Wemheuer: Famine Politics in Maoist China and the Soviet Union (Der große Hunger. Hungersnöte unter Stalin und Mao), the author also did extensive research and interviews with survivors of the famine in China and published several books about this. 

This is from memory and I'm sure the wording is wrong. I though I read the quote a few years back in this text by Loren Goldner - "Communism is the Material Human Community", however, all I find is this: 

In the linked paper, the authers experiment with indirect and direct cooking methods. It turns out that indirect cooking (via stones) takes a bit longer using large logs, but not substantially so. However, when using smaller wood chips in the kind of fire on might make indoors, the researches failed to bring water to a boil even using a substantial amount of wood. So under the circumstances on the arctic coast, where wood was scarce, direct boiling was more efficient. 

The Hussites, a religios and movement that faught the Hussite wars, where known for thisbattle tactic: They fired with cannon and crossbows from the cover of carts until the enemy was in diasarray, then hussite infantry with pikes and flais would attack. It was alleged that they would sing church dittys while bashing knights with their flails. The hussites founded their own tradition of religos singing. That the Hussites sung while fighting may be hyperbole, but according to German wikipedia at one battle their enemy ran away because of the intimidating songs - or so one story goes. So maybe Hugo heard of the Hussites and their battle songs, decied it to be a cool detail for his story and exchanged one farming implement for another, taking some artistic license.
