I've attached lights etc. with anti-tamper torx screws and normal screws in awkward places (like under the rear rack). Both have some deterrent value over normal screws in easy-to-reach places, which in turn are better than clips that need no tools at all. Some modifications may be required to replace the thumbscrew with something more secure. But I had half a front light stolen because the rest was well screwed on - they opened it as you would for changing the batteries. Most lights are designed to be easy to take off, which might as well mean hard to secure. For anything other than cheap rubbish lights you should reckon that they'll be stolen or destroyed in the attempt whatever you do. You should probably make the same assumption even for cheap rubbish if you reply on them, or at least have a backup (in my case a cheap rear light on my pannier - which comes with me - and a headtorch on my helmet). 

It's common etiquette, at least everywhere I've been, to stay away from wet and muddy trails (unless they're supposed to be or always are a mudfest). Riding on a muddy trail makes ruts which make the trail conditions worse for everyone once the mud dries and the ground hardens. In addition to ruts, if the trail is muddy and you slide out a front wheel going around a turn, for example, your wheel can scrape several inches of trail off. This can cause erosion problems later on. However, as alluded to earlier, if the trail is a known mudbog and stays muddy year-round, one more rut probably won't hurt anything. Another common counterexample is when the trail is melting in the afternoons but can be ridden early in the day when the ground is frozen. If you're crazy enough to be out riding then, more power to you. But generally speaking, it is in good taste to stay off melting, muddy trails. Any time your presence can alter the trail physically (ruts, slide-offs, feature damage), everyone else who shares the trail with you will be glad you stayed off. 

A double-sided chuck for both Presta and Schrader valves, with sturdy lever "Universal" chucks don't work as well and aren't as durable (IME, so not the most expensive), while the type that involve switching bits inside are one thing for carrying on the bike when space/weight is at a premium but another for workshop use. 

My daughter still goes in a Hamax siesta at nearly 3. It's seatpost mounted and we swap it between bikes. The seat is rated to 22kg (which from the growth charts should take 99% of children up to age 4 and 75% to 5Â½. We're anticipating being able to use it when she starts school. You don't need to include the weight of the balance bike as that wouldn't be carried on the toddler seat. The rack-mounted seats don't have a much higher limit - in fact then the limit is usually the rack itself, which has to carry the weight of the seat and the balance bike for you. So you may actually find a lower weight limit overall despite a higher child weight limit. But on both bikes we have a rack underneath. I haven't tried carrying her balance bike at the same time yet - she's not yet into going very far on it. But putting the balance bike vertically, with the handlebars at the top rear resting on the rack, and strapping the balance bike frame to the rack should work (at least on 700C/29er etc.). I managed to get some quick pictures (I didn't even have time to arrange everything somewhere less cluttered so sorry about the quality). I wasn't quite how I envisaged: 

It will probably depend on terrain, speed, and other aerodynamic (or lack thereof) factors whether one would even notice a difference between an "aero" frame or a "normal" frame. If you're climbing lots of hills, riding in traffic, or otherwise not in a position where wind resistance is your chief enemy, I doubt you'd see a benefit from going aero. If you live out in the farmlands and ride on fast, flat roads, or somewhere that has lots of wind, you may notice a difference, because wind/air resistance becomes a factor. 

In small neighborhoods like this it's also not a bad idea to stay out in the lane and not hug the curb. This gives you much more time if a car or child comes hurtling out into the road and you're not going to be slowing down a following car very much. Edit: include the warning to watch for dogs. This is pretty important. 

The difference for 2 years is that the degradation is more certain, leading to your bike being more likely to be scrapped as abandoned. If the bike isn't special enough to take with you it's probably better to sell it and replace it when you get back as after a couple of years it will probably need more than it's worth spent on it. A few weeks doesn't seem much worse than a weekend if you oil everything and can keep the worst of the rain off (I do this several times a year under the edge of a canopy on a station platform). 

The short answer is yes (with apologies to jimrings). The long answer is that your choice is very limited (and depends on your definition of road tyre - do you mean road-bike tyre or road-use tyre)?. You'll need to look at $URL$ or similar for what widths are compatible, and for urban riding (debris) or light off-road tracks (thorns) I would strongly suggest a kevlar anti-puncture belt. The thinnest of the popular kevlar slicks available in 26" appears to be the Schwalbe marathon, but you could also try the Schwalbe road cruiser (I use these on my hybrid) or continental's comfort-contact 

I've never ridden a belt-drive bicycle, but I've ridden both belt and chain drive motorcycles and the belt drive is considerably smoother and quieter. One of the features being used to tout belt-driven bikes is that they don't require lubing, so that would be a plus. In addition to not needing to take the time to properly lube your drive-train, the lack of lube would mean less attractant for dirt/dust etc. Each manufacturer would probably have their own recommendations about operating temperature range and how often to change them. 

Lube your chain frequently. As in every time it rains if you need to. Depending on the drive-train, you can get Shimano or SRAM chains at places like Nashbar or Performance Bike, but even top-of-the-line, expensive chains will get rusty if they're out in the rain all the time. The same will hold with a Brooks saddle. No matter how awesome it is, if it's exposed to poor conditions without proper maintenance, it will deteriorate quickly. So lube your chain frequently, and dry it off whenever you get a chance before storing it. Disclaimer: If you go riding around with tons of lube on your chain in dry, dusty conditions, you'll pick up lots of dirt in your drivetrain. 

In this case it would also be possible to get a bike round the gate. Some care is needed in designing the layout of bollards and similar to ensure that recumbents and especially trikes can pass, but a straight stretch of path makes this easier. I suggest that blocking cars isn't the hard part. Blocking motorbikes is the hard part and not one I've seen a good solution to, as off-road motorbikes aren't much bigger than bikes (narrower than trikes) and can be lifted over a step-over gate. 

The simple cheap design of bell that makes a single ping when the lever is flicked against its spring should be more robust. I've never had one fail. The screw that attaches it to the bar should stay tight but anyway can be tightened if it works loose. The adjusting screw (if there is one) should have some friction. 

I have used SPD and Crank Brothers (I have a set of Mallets on my mountain bike, and Candy SLs on my road bike). Both the Mallet and the Candy are built around the egg beaters. I have to say I greatly prefer the Crank Brothers. 

Don't expect much until you know the guys that work at a bike shop. I bought my first road bike (a single speed) from my not-so-local LBS because it was on sale (45 miles from my house, with several bike shops in between). In the process, I discovered that I got along well with the guys that work there. In return for our growing relationship, they started giving me pointers about maintenance, and discounts on accessories (computer, bar tape, etc). When I referred my father-in-law to them to get a bike (he's a doctor and doesn't have the same price constraints that I do) they gave him a pretty good deal because I sent him. I have no doubt that when I've saved my pennies enough to budget for a new bike I'll get as good a deal as they can offer me, without having to ask for a deal. Most bike shop employees and owners could make a lot more money doing something else, but own/work at a bike shop because they love cycling. I appreciated the desire to stretch your dollars as far as they'll go, but nobody is entitled to special deals without earning them.
