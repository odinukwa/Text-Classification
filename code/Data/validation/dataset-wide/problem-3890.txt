The study of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Riemann surfaces with boundary can be reduced to the study of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of closed Riemann surfaces together with the study of separating antiholomorphic involutions on them. More precisely, the data of a compact Riemann surface A with (nonempty) boundary can be recovered from its double S=double(A) (a closed Riemann surface), the natural antiholomorphic involution $\iota$ on $S$ and the choice of one connected component C of $S\setminus Fix(\iota)$. Thus Isomorphism classes of compact Riemann surfaces A of a given type are naturally identified with Isomorphism classes of triples $(S,\iota,C)$ (for a separating antiholomorphic involution $\iota$) such that C is of the same topological type as A. In your specific case, the doubles are tori. As Riemann surfaces these doubles can only degenerate in one way, but there are two distinct isomorphism types of involutions on the limit: In one case the fixed point set of the involution has a component consisting of the node and a circle disjoint from the node; in the other case the fixed point set consists of two circles, both passing through the node, but otherwise disjoint. The first case gives rise to a disk with an interior puncture, the second to a disk, meeting with two punctures on the boundary, which form together a boundary node. If the conformal modulus of the annulus A goes to zero (i.e. $R\rightarrow 0$, the latter case), then the geodesic contracting is simply obtained by doubling a segment joining the two boundary components of $A$. 

Question 2: Yes, there are conformal metrics on a divergent sequence of tori with Area=1 and bounded diameter: Cutting the torus open along an embedded essential curve, you obtain a cylinder, conformally equivalent to $[0,R] \times S^1$. The fact that the sequence of conformal structures diverges, means that we can choose the cutting curve such that $R_n\rightarrow \infty$. However this is not really relevant here and we just directly construct such a conformal metric for any such cylinder (which gives rise to a conformal metric on the torus). Note that any conformal metric on such a standard cylinder has the form $h|dz|^2$. If $R\leq 5$ choose just any function $1\leq h\leq 2$ which glues nicely back to a metric on the torus; up to rescaling we obtain conformal metric of area 1 and bounded diameter. If $R\geq 5$, choose $h\leq 2$ everywhere and $h\geq 1$ on a neighborhood $[0,1]\times S^1 \cup [R-1,R]\times S^1$ of the boundary (and such that it glues nicely) and arbitrary small away from the boundary, say $h=1/R^2$ on $[2,R-2]\times S^1$. Up to rescaling by a factor in $[1,10]$, we can ensure that the area is 1 and clearly the diameter is bounded. Question 3: The argument of Thomas Richard shows you can embed any cylinder of the form $[0,R)\times S^1$ for $R\in (0,\infty]$ into any torus. The cylinder $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ cannot be embedded into any compact Riemann surface $S\neq S^2$, since it would extend to an embedding of $S^2$. On the other hand, covering maps give immersions from $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ into any torus (but no such immersions exist into surfaces of hyperbolic type). If the embedding is supposed to be $\pi_1$-injective, then the maximal $R$ such that $(0,R)\times S^1$ embeds into a complex torus $(T^2,j)$ is determined by the length $l_j$ of the systole of the torus in the conformal class determined by $j$. Indeed one can see that the maximal $R$ satisfies $R=1/l_j^2$. 

Conway and Sloane, as well as Cassels, and also O'Meara, all have their own idiosyncratic way of expressing the following result (for good primes): Every quadratic form with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is equivalent by a change of variables with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}_p$ to one expressible as $\oplus_{i} p^{e_i}h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$, where $h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$ is $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+y_{m_i}^2$ if $\epsilon_i=0$, and $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+ry_{m_i}^2$ with $r$ a quadratic nonresidue if $\epsilon_i=1$. Furthermore there is a quadratic form $f$ over the integers with given local components $f_i$ if and only if the compatibility conditions for rational equivalence are satisfied. In the case of rational equivalence this has been given an effective treatment by Kirschmer and a coauthor whose name escapes me right now: given a discriminant and a list of primes where the form should have negative Hasse-Witt invariant, they compute a quadratic form. What I would like is a function that given a discriminant (as an integer), and a list of local components, computes a quadratic form in the given genus, i.e. computes the form $f$ described above. 

I've got a new criterion for comparing Galois reps which are four dimensional if we know the kernel of the residual representation mod $5$ (or any large odd prime) and the Sato-Tate groups (should be same for each one) are connected. Note that we don't need to have a large residual image, so this applies to a different set of representations than Faltings-Serre. It also doesn't use a large tower, making it stronger and more efficient than existing variants of the Livne method. What I don't have are some good examples: the one I was working on when I discovered this method really requires a criterion that works for $p=2$, which is a lot more complicated (and I don't have a handle on yet). So does anyone have some Galois representations to compare lying around meeting my critera? The kernel of the residual representation may be hard to determine on the automorphic side: I'm working on ways to fix that. 

One can get some upper bounds based on the classical results and some new results. However, I do not know whether these upper bounds are sharp. Therefore my answer should be considered as comment and not as the actual answer to your question. I will just repeat the well-known argument and I will try to extract the information regarding the bound. Let $T$ be a Calderon--Zigmund operator and $b \in BMO$. Consider the analytic function $T_{z}(f)=e^{zb}T(e^{-zb}f)$. Note that: $$ [T,b]f=\frac{d}{dz} T_{z}(f)|_{z=0}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|z|=r}\frac{T_{z}(f)}{z^{2}}dz, \quad r>0 $$ Then Minkowski's inequality together with weighted norm estimates justifies the following chain of inequalities \begin{align} \|[T,b]f\|_{L^{p}}\leq \frac{1}{2\pi r^{2}} \int_{|z|=r}\|T_{z}(f)\|_{L^{p}}|dz|\leq \frac{1}{r}\sup_{|z|=r}\|T_{z}(f)\|_{L^{p}}=\frac{1}{r}\sup_{|z|=r}\|T(e^{-zb}f)\|_{L^{p}(e^{pb\Re z})}\\ \leq \frac{1}{r}\sup_{|z|=r}\|T\|_{L^{p}(e^{pb\Re z}) \to L^{p}(e^{pb\Re z})}\|f\|_{L^{p}} \end{align} Now we would like to minimize the constant $c(r)=\frac{1}{r}\sup_{|z|=r}\|T\|_{L^{p}(e^{pb\Re z}) \to L^{p}(e^{pb\Re z})}$ over $r\in (0,\infty)$. For the large class of Calderon--Zigmund integral operators $T$ we have the following bound $\|T\|_{L^{p}(w)\to L^{p}(w)}\leq C(T,p)[w]_{A_{p}}^{\max\{\frac{1}{p-1},1\}}$ See for example Theorem 17.1 $URL$ (you can also find in the book that the inequality holds for the operators when the modulus of continuity of the kernel satisfies some integrability assumption). Hilbert transform does satisfy this condition, and as I am aware of, the bound $[w]_{A_{p}}^{\max\{\frac{1}{p-1},1\}}$ is sharp. In the case of Hilbert transform one can extract the sharp (maybe?) bound for the constant $C(H,p)$ (from other papers). I would suggest to ask F. Nazarov regarding this question. This implies that $c(r) \leq C(H,p) \frac{1}{r} \sup_{|z|=r} [e^{pb\Re z}]_{A_{p}}^{\max\{\frac{1}{p-1},1\}}$. In order to get more explicit estimate one has to solve the following extremal problem. Let $\|b\|_{BMO}=\varepsilon$ and let $t>0$. Then what is the sharp upper bound of the quantity $[e^{pb t}]_{A_{p}}$ in terms of $\varepsilon, t, p$. The last extremal problem can be solved by Bellman function technique, and if somebody will be interested I can show how it works. Remark: surely instead of estimating integral by its maximal value one can leave the integral and get the bound $C(H,p) \inf_{r>0} \frac{1}{2\pi r^{2}} \int_{|z|=r} [e^{pb\Re z}]_{A_{p}}^{\max\{\frac{1}{p-1},1\}}|dz|$ 

The image of $\Lambda_2$ in $G/\Lambda_1$ is finite. Take a set of representatives $s_1, s_2, \ldots s_n$ in $\Lambda_2$. Now consider $\cup s_i F_2$. I claim this is a Borel fundamental domain for $F_1$. It is Borel as it is a finite union of Borel sets. Let $g\Lambda_1$ be a coset of $\Lambda_1$. Then $g\Lambda_2$ intersects $F_2$ in a single point $x$. Now, $\Lambda_2 = \cup s_i \Lambda_1$, and so $x$ is in some $s_i$ translate of $F_2$, and hence in $F_1$. It is unique as otherwise we have $s_i \lambda_1 = s_j \lambda_1'$, which would mean our set of representatives was too big in the first place. 

In Claus Sorenson's PhD thesis, he proves a theorem about level lifting of paramodular forms whose associated automorphic representation has component $\pi_{\infty}$ that is the "cohomological holomorphic discrete series representation". But it isn't clear to me why the definite article is appropriate, or how to translate this description into Blattner parameters. So what is this representation, and why it is unique as defined above? 

Numerical Recipes, 3rd edition, Chapter 3 describes a vast number of interpolation methods with source code. It seems from what you are telling us that something is confused in the paper: Chebyshev interpolation has to do with picking points at which to minimize error of the ensuing result, but perhaps something else was meant/the usage is slightly different. 

Let $K$ be an abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We know that $[x, K]|_{\mathrm{Gal}{\mathbb{Q}^{ab}}}=[\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} x, \mathbb{Q}]$ where $[x, F]$ is the Artin reciprocity map. Given a modulus $\mathfrak{m}$ of $K$, we get a modulus $\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathfrak{m}$. While I can write down abstractly how the Galois groups of the corresponding ray class fields are related, I don't know how the fields are related: will they embed in an easily understood manner? 

Consider an elliptic curve. This is $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a lattice. As a real manifold this is a two dimensional manifold. Therefore, if we want to have an etale cohomology theory compatible with the real cohomology theory the dimension should be two. 

In the latter case I think I can show that $c(k,n)>C(A,\varepsilon)\, n^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}$. But I am almost convinced that the right lower bound should be $C(A)\sqrt{n}$. I also think that this should be somethig well--known, so any reference would be helpful. Remarks: 

How do you find these family of segments (or it is the same as to ask how do you find directions $(\cos(\alpha(s)),\sin(\alpha(s)))$). How do you glue a global picture? Under what conditions this ``roughly speaking'' is justified? 

In general one has the following bound on your integral $$ \frac{2}{3}L^{3/2}+ \frac{L^{1/2}}{\sqrt{2}}\ln \left(\frac{1+2K}{2+2(K-L)}\right)\leq \mathrm{integral}\leq \frac{2}{3}L^{3/2}+ L^{1/2} \ln\left(\frac{3+4K}{1+4(K-L)}\right) $$ Let us make change of variables $x=Ly$. Then we want to estimate from above $$ L^{3/2}\int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y \left(1+ \frac{1}{K-Ly}\right)} - \sqrt{y}\; dy $$ We have $$ \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y}\left(\frac{\sqrt{K-Ly+1}-\sqrt{K-Ly}}{\sqrt{K-Ly}} \right)\; dy = \frac{1}{K}\times \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}(\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}+\sqrt{1-(L/K)y})} \right)\; dy \leq \frac{1}{K} \times \int_{0}^{1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}} \right)\; dy = \frac{1}{L}\ln\left( \frac{1+2K+2\sqrt{K}\sqrt{K+1}}{1+2(K-L)+2\sqrt{K-L}\sqrt{K-L+1}}\right)\leq \frac{1}{L}\ln\left(\frac{3+4K}{1+4(K-L)}\right) $$ Update (lower bound): $$ \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}(\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}+\sqrt{1-(L/K)y})} \right)\; dy \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{1/2}^{1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}} \right)\; dy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\int_{1-\frac{L}{K}}^{1-\frac{L}{2K}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{z}\sqrt{z+\frac{1}{K}}}dz $$ Now let us use the fact that $$ \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^{2}+\frac{z}{K}}} = \ln \left(1+ 2Kz +2\sqrt{Kz}\sqrt{Kz+1}\right) - \ln K, \quad z>0 $$ which can be checked by direct differentiation (but I will skip it), then we can continuo our chain of inequalities $$ =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\,\ln \frac{1+2(K-\frac{L}{2}) +2\sqrt{K-\frac{L}{2}}\sqrt{K-\frac{L}{2}+1}}{1+2(K-L) +2\sqrt{K-L}\sqrt{K-L+1}}\geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\,\ln \frac{1+4(K-\frac{L}{2})}{2+2(K-L)}\geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\,\ln \frac{1+2K}{2+2(K-L)} $$ which is pretty much the same. 

The answer is negative. As you said if you take $\frac{t}{2\pi}$ to be a rational number, say $\frac{p}{q}$ then it converges to the Gaus-sums: $$ \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \cos(k^{2} t) = \Re \frac{1}{q} \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} \exp\left( 2 \pi i \cdot \frac{p}{q} k^{2}\right) $$ Now if you take $t=\frac{4 \pi}{5}$ (i.e., $p=2, q=5$) I think it should no be difficult to show that the latter sum is a negative number $< - 0.4$ (even without taking the real part). 

The following should answer to your question: if you denote $f^{2}=g$ then the log-Sobolev inequality can be rewritten as follows: $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} \left( g \ln g - \frac{1}{2c}\frac{|\nabla g|^{2}}{g} \right)d\mu \leq \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} g d\mu \right) \ln \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} g d\mu \right). $$ Consider the case $n=1$. Lets start from a slightly general optimization problem: \begin{align*} B(t,x,z) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \sup_{f \in C^{1}(\mathbb{R})}\left\{\int_{-\infty}^{t} F(f,f')d\mu, \; f(t)=x, \; \int_{-\infty}^{t} f d\mu=z \right\}. \quad (1) \end{align*} where $d\mu=\varphi(x) dx$ is a nice measure with density $\varphi(x)$ (in your case it will be the Gaussian measure), $F(x,y)$ is a fixed smooth enough function (in your case $F(x,y)=x\ln x - \frac{1}{2c} \frac{y^{2}}{x}$). Clearly if you find explicitly $B(t,x,z)$ then log-Sobolev inequality simply is a statement that $$ B(\infty, x, z) \leq z \ln z \quad \forall x \geq 0 $$ for the function $F(x,y)$ mentioned above. But how to find $B$? It is the fundamental principle in optimization theory that $B$ should satisfy a Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. I will briefly summarize it in the following two lemmas. The next lemma shows that sometimes you do not have to find $B$ precisely. Lemma Let $M(t,x,z) :\mathbb{R}^{3} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a $C^{1}$ function. If \begin{align*} F(x,y) \varphi(t) \leq M_{t} + y M_{x}+x\varphi(t) M_{z} \quad \forall t,x,z,y \in \mathbb{R} \quad (2) \end{align*} then \begin{align*} \int_{\mathbb{R}} F(f,f')d\mu \leq M(-\infty, 0, 0) - M\left(\infty, 0, \int_{\mathbb{R}} fd\mu\right) \end{align*} for any smooth compactly supported function $f$. Proof Indeed, \begin{align*} &0 \geq \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\left[F(f(t),f'(t))\varphi(t) - \frac{d}{dt}M\left(t,f(t), \int_{-\infty}^{t} f d\mu \right) \right]dt=\\ &\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F(f,f')d\mu-\left[M\left( t_{2},f(t_{2}), \int_{-\infty}^{t_{2}}fd\mu\right) - M\left(t_{1}, f(t_{1}), \int_{-\infty}^{t_{1}}d\mu \right) \right]. \end{align*} And the rest follows by taking $t_{1} \to -\infty$ and $t_{2} \to +\infty$. $\square$ The next lemma shows that actually $B$ defined in (1) does satisfy (2) Lemma We have \begin{align*} F(x,y) \varphi(t) \leq B_{t} + y B_{x}+x\varphi(t) B_{z} \quad \forall t,x,z,y \in \mathbb{R} \quad (3) \end{align*} Proof Take a time $t+\varepsilon$ and consider an optimizer $f$ on the interval $(-\infty, t)$. Next extend it as $f(s) = f(t)+(s-t)y$ on the interval $[t,t+\varepsilon]$. Let $z(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t} f d\mu$. Then we have \begin{align*} &B\left[t+\varepsilon, f(t)+\varepsilon y, z(t)+\int_{t}^{t+\varepsilon} (f(t)+(s-t)y,y)d\mu \right] \geq \int_{-\infty}^{t+\varepsilon}F(f,f')d\mu=\\ &B(t,f(t),z)+\int_{t}^{t+\varepsilon} F(f(t)+(s-t)y,y)d\mu \end{align*} Moving $B(t,f(t),z(t))$ to the left hand side of the inequality, dividing everything by $\varepsilon$, sending $\varepsilon \to 0$, and comparing the first order terms we obtain (3 at the point $(t,f(t),z(t),y)$. Since this point can be chosen to be arbitrary we obtain the claim. $\square$ The last lemma looks very convincing but it still requires some justifications, for example, why the optimizer $f(t)$ exists? These are deep questions and we are not going to talk about this right now. Thus we have obtained almost a PDE on $B$ (see (3)). Clearly (3) implies that \begin{align*} B_{t}+x\varphi(t) B_{z} + \inf_{y}\{ B_{x} y - F(x,y)\varphi(t)\}\geq 0 \quad (4) \end{align*} The last observation is that inequality (4) should be equality, otherwise we could slightly perturb $B$ and make it smaller (this also requires further justifications). Thus we have finally arrived to Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman PDE. $$ B_{t}+x\varphi(t) B_{z} + \inf_{y}\{ B_{x} y - F(x,y)\varphi(t)\}=0 \quad (5) $$ and any solution of (5) or supersolution (i.e., the one which satisfies (4)) gives rise to the functional inequality $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} F(f,f')d\mu \leq B(-\infty, 0, 0)-B\left(\infty,0, \int_{\mathbb{R}} f d\mu\right) \quad (6) $$ It's funny isn't it? The measure $d\mu$ does not matter, $F(x,y)$ does not matter.. In the paper you mentioned I would guess that the authors guessed from Euler--Lagrange (or new from Gross' paper) the optimizers for the log-Sobolev inequality in (1) where $F(x,y)=x\ln x - \frac{1}{2c} \frac{y^{2}}{x}$ and they just plugged them into (1) and found $B$. Then it was pretty straightforward to check (4) and obtain (6). For me this looks like a "cheating" :D. The paper is nice and it is very nice application of Control Theory in this field. But I believe one should start from solving Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman PDE (5) which is the first order nonlinear PDE, so the characteristic method should work. 

Let $L/\mathbb{Q}$ be a Galois closed field with Galois group a subgroup of $S_6$. Is it the case that $L$ is the compositum of Galois closures of linearly disjoint fields of degree at most $6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$? Currently this looks true from a bashing argument: taking each subgroup of $S_6$ up to isomorphism and either noting it is a direct product, or it has a large subgroup which is not normal and whose normalizer is the whole subgroup. Bashing argument isn't complete yet, so this might still be false. I'd like something more elegant though, and if it works for $S_n$ even better. 

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups over the ring of integers $R$ of a local field $F$ with finite residue characteristic $p$. Suppose we have a surjection $\phi$ from $G(F)$ to $H(F)$, and another surjection $\bar{\phi}$ from $G(k)$ to $H(k)$. Is this enough to conclude the image of a parahoric in $G$ is a parahoric in $H$? 

Sato-Tate has a much more general form in random matrix theory stating that the Satake parameters are distributed as the eigenvalues of some random matrix in a compact Lie group related to the Zariski closure of the image of the associated Galois representation. The measure is just the Haar measure on that group. This applies to abelian representations, and recovers Hecke's equidistribution result. 

The answer is yes. There is a sign walk entirely within each compartment that removes the minus signs and produces the same normalized symbol for each train. Therefore the compartments of the two different trains are isomorphic as they have the same normalized symbol, even if that normalized symbol isn't the symbol of an actual quadratic form. 

Let $A$ and $B$ be Hecke eigenforms of some weight $k$ and level $N$. We know that there are irreducible representations $\rho_a$, $\rho_b$ of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ whose trace of Frobenius of $p$ is given by $a_p$ or $b_p$, the Fourier coefficients of $A$ or $B$. $AB$ is a modular form of weight $2k$. It isn't clearly a Hecke eigenform, but its Fourier coefficients are still algebraic numbers, and it can be expressed as a sum of Hecke eigenforms and possibly an Eisenstein series of weight $2k$. We also have $\rho_a \otimes \rho_b$ a representation. It isn't irreducible, but can be expressed as a sum of irreducibles. The obvious hope is that this would correspond to the product, but that cannot be true because the characters don't match up. But convolution if appropriately defined would produce a form related to $\rho_a \otimes \rho_b$. So my two questions: what is multiplication of modular forms representation-theoretically, and what is tensoring of representations on the modular forms side?
