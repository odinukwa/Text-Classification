I've applied for positions and not received responses for months. Most recently I received a text from a company I applied to more than a year ago. It is a side job kind of deal, so something I wasn't going to actively pursue. You can play the patience game or actively find a way to contact the appropriate person with the organization. Use manta or LinkedIn to find a working phone number. Be persistent yet polite. If you really want it, go get it. Don't think someone will be beating down your door to hire you. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of people applying for the same job every single day. Good luck! You might receive more specific suggestions if you let us know what kind of job this is. Specific job classifications have "typical" personality types expected to apply. I'm in sales so if I'm not aggressive when applying for a job I'm not showing my potential employer my skills in that area. 

Hand written thank you notes will get you bonus points. Don't go too cutesy. Be professional and mention specifics from the interview. Address it to the person you interviewed with, not HR. 

Why argue with this situation, unless the time punch system is cumbersome or unreliable. I'm salaried and have to fill in a time sheet every week. For HR purposes it is sometimes necessary to have all employees track hours. Also, some types of exempt employees are required to work 40 hours per defined work week but aren't given overtime for days they work +8 hours. Even high level executives are required to submit time sheets or record hours within my organization. Just clock in and out and stop complaining. Honestly, it makes you less desirable as an employee to protest against such a simple request. 

TL;DR There is a disconnect between what my boss (Manager X) remembers and what the rest of the team see and hear. Regardless of what was agreed or discussed in the past, even when it is in writing, what he later recalls can be substantially different. How can I hold a manager demonstrating a lack of consistency in their actions to account? Background Examples of the Manager X's behaviour include that he will: 

Background I manage a team of about 12 employees in an engineering business. Although I am the manager in the organizational structure, I've structured the team to have two senior engineers work as 'project leads' who manage projects on a day-to-day basis. My team are all located in our head office. Our company recently purchased another firm operating in the same market but which is substantially smaller and located in another city. As part of merging the two firms I've been reallocated three staff who were a team providing a similar function (one manager plus two juniors). All three will report to me in the new organization structure. Job titles and responsibilities may change but there will be no change in salary. Given my new responsibilities due to the buyout, I have a need for additional staff. Problem Integrating the two junior engineers into my team isn't an issue, but having the team manager (manager X) report to me is causing some concerns. In practice, this would mean Manager X reporting to one of my senior engineers at a project level under the current structure. Manager X has about the same level of experience (in years) as the senior engineers. From a functional perspective, I have no desire to change the structure of my team. I am also unsure about what Manager X's capabilities are - I have his CV but that's very different to what someone is capable of in the real world. However, I realize from the perspective of Manager X, reporting to one of my senior engineers is a significant step backwards in terms of his career. I see my options as: 

You should consider asking the manager to explain what is going on. They sent the letter to the board, and as a member of the board it is up to you to act upon it. Just ask the manager questions until you fully understand the purpose of sending you the letter, the history of the manager with this assistant and the history of the manager with previous assistants s/he has worked with. Ask why the manager felt it was necessary to involve the board in this. Ask why the manager's manager wasn't involved. Try to understand if there really is a problem with this employee or with the manager. Maybe the manager really is doing the right thing, due to things of which you haven'been appraised. Maybe the manager treats all staff like this, and is a cancer for the organization who should be replaced as soon as possible. Or maybe s/he just wasn't ever trained in how to manage and needs some formal training. 

Talk to your manager and coworkers and ask how they solve problems like this. There might be a process you don't know about. When you talk to the folks in the US, assume that there are good reasons for why things are done as they are, and that there's a process for what you need. Ask them how to go about solving this challenge. It might be very simple, like submitting a request and getting your manager's approval. And assuming that they are coming from a good place helps to attain collaboration instead of antagonism. Don't complain. You'll turn off your audience and you'll make things harder on yourself. Be as helpful to the person from whom you need help as you can. If they tell you that something will take them time, ask if there's anything you can do to help so that it will be easier or take less time. The answer is usually 'no', but the offer is usually appreciated. Keep your manager up to date as you work on this. S/he needs to know if you are making progress or if your are running into roadblocks. When emails don't work, use the phone. If you have a phone call with someone in the US, try to have the call at a reasonable time for those in the US. We in the US are often forced to have calls with people overseas at very uncomfortable hours, either before normal work hours (and before we usually wake up) or after normal work hours (sometimes after we normally go to sleep). While they should make a reasonable effort to accommodate your schedule, you should make an effort to accommodate theirs. Smile when you are on the phone. You may not think it makes a difference, but it changes the whole tone of your voice. If you think that there's any chance that a cultural difference may be in the way, apologize and admit that you really aren't an expert in the US culture and you don't want to offend. It's not your fault, but apologizing deescalates and helps things move along. If you can't make any progress, talk to your boss and ask them what to do. When you ask for something, and you are told 'no' ask 'what is the process for getting access?' If they give you a process, follow it. 

Tell Manager X that he'll be reporting to one of my senior engineers for project work. If he doesn't like it he can leave. I see the risk here is that he hangs around for some time while looking for a new job and drags down team morale. Restructure my team to bring Manager X in as a senior engineer (thus having three project leads, one located remotely) and run the risk that my team dynamic changes or that Manager X is a poor leader. Suggest to HR that Manager X is in fact surplus to requirements and have him made redundant. This would make other employees from the company we bought quite concerned given that they were told there would be no redundancies resulting from the merger, and undermine my case for additional employees in the team in future. 

Question Are there any other risks I should be considering when making my choice about how to proceed, or a 'fourth' option that should be considered when dealing with this type of situation? Clarification: A number of comments asked "why haven't you discussed this with Manager X yet". To be clear: I have on several occasions. HR and our respective bosses were part of those conversations at the early stages, followed by one-on-one discussions to sort out the details. In these discussions Manager X has indicated a strong preference to maintain his manager-level position and the status quo. This is not an option because other changes in the company have meant that the functions previously performed by Manager X's team are no longer required by the business. Also, I have now been told by my manager to 'just get it done'. Note that my concern with (2) is not about changing the structure of the team, but in bringing in a potentially disgruntled employee into a leadership role who is not familiar with our product and creates more work for my current team.
