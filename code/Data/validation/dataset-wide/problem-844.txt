To answer my own question: no, not that I can find. Here is an attempt to identify them by image search. Let me know if there is an image/legend match that seems wrong. I can upload a higher resolution (466x426 px) version of the image. The images were cropped from the original image when it was oriented so the the 'HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE' message read from the bottom to top of image, and I will try to identify them in the same order. As such, we do 1 column at a time from top to bottom, starting from the right most. The column is marked in red above/below. But first, here is the captioned video created from combining the captions with a video slideshow of the images! Column 1 

Titan is roughly ten times more massive than Pluto or Eris, the most massive known Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). (Titan is in fact more massive than any other moon in the Solar System except Ganymede.) It would be a rather strange coincidence if the object that was by far the most massive of the KBOs was in orbit around Saturn, well interior to the Kuiper Belt. Titan's orbit is prograde (it orbits in the same direction that Saturn rotates) and barely tilted with respect to Saturn's equator (less than half a degree), the rings, and most of the other moons. That strongly suggests it formed out of an accretion disk around Saturn, as the Galilean moons formed around Jupiter. Titan also has an extremely dense atmosphere, unlike any of the KBOs. So it's rather unlikely that Titan is a captured KBO. (Neptun's moon Triton, by the way, is thought to be a captured KBO. But it is only slightly more massive than Eris or Pluto, and it has a peculiar retrograde orbit that is very difficult to explain if it formed around Neptune, but easier to explain if it was captured. And since Neptune is the furthest out of the (known) major planets, it's not that surprising that it could have captured a KBO.) 

(Alex is also correct that you have almost no resolution near the value of r_eff that you are trying to find.)

I have a 6000px x 4800 px version of this image (reduced & rotated to 480x600 here) that I use for an image slide show. I would like to add the description of each image into the slide show software. On this system the file name is but I suspect I coined that title (it was a long time ago it was downloaded). The original image is 5,150,779 bytes in size. Searching on the smaller, rotated version of the image points to pages like Astronomy Printshop, but there is nothing closely related to NASA in the first pages of the search, and the pages listed did not have much detail (certainly no legend). It might possible to search on the clipped, individual images, but I was hoping to avoid having to do that 88 times. 

China is pretty well integrated into modern astronomy -- there are regular international conferences held in China (the most recent General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union was held in Beijing in 2012), lots of Chinese astronomers at other international conferences, Chinese participation in international observatory projects (the Joint Institute for VLBI, the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Square Kilometer Array, etc.), and so forth. I'm not sure I'd say they have any really significant facilities yet (with the possible exception of LAMOST), but they have very ambitious plans, as you've noted. (ITAR has very little to do with astronomy except when it comes to a few things like nuclear physics codes produced by places like Los Alamos.) I don't know how much international participation is anticipated for the FAST project, though I gather the instrument development has some involvement from British and Australian institutes, so they'd likely get some time. Yes, results from the Changâ€™E-3 mission have been published in scientific papers, e.g. $URL$ There are several Chinese astronomy journals (e.g., Acta Astronomica Sinica; Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics), but like most "national" journals they aren't that important internationally. 

In addition to the diffraction issues pointed out by Conrad Turner, a Fresnel lens would suffer from all the other problems that large lenses in telescopes suffer from: 

A spectrum imaged onto a CCD or other detector consists of photons spread out along a wavelength axis. Signal-to-noise (S/N) depends on how many photons you have from the source, how many from the background, intrinsic noise from the electronics, etc. -- and what kind of bin you're adding up the photons in. If you summed up all the photons across the spectrum (over all wavelengths), you'd get one number with a very high S/N, but no spectral information. If you divided the spectrum into N different wavelength bins, you'd get a lower S/N per bin, but more spectral information. What the S/N ratio you mention means is that if you divided that spectrum into bins that were 1 Angstrom wide, you'd have enough photons in each bin for a S/N of 10 in each bin (at least for some region of the spectrum, probably near the central wavelength). You can then have some idea how the S/N would improve for bins larger than 1 Angstrom in size, or how it would get worse for smaller bins. S/N per Angstrom is conventional for optical spectroscopy, both because Angstroms are traditional and because moderate resolutions spectrographs often have scales of a few tenths to several Angstroms per pixel along the wavelength direction.

You're right; the effect of solar tides on the Earth would be to increase the Earth's (or Earth+Moon's) orbital angular momentum around the Sun. But it would be difficult to compute this properly, and probably impossible to measure the effect, because of all the other small alterations to the Earth's orbit going on. A simple way to see the effect (which I gather you've already worked out) is to imagine two equal-mass objects in circular orbit about their common center of mass (midway between the two), one effectively a point mass (e.g., black hole) and the other being the Earth. If all motion is prograde (Earth rotates in same direction as orbit) and the Earth rotates faster than the orbital period, then the Earth's tidal bulge will be slightly ahead of the Earth-Sun direction. Then the near-side bulge will experience a retarding force from the point mass (slowing the Earth's rotation) while simultaneously pulling on the point mass in approximately the same direction as the latter's orbital motion. So the point mass is accelerated, adding to the angular momentum and making the orbit larger. I believe that most attempts to estimate the solar tidal torque on the Earth end up with it begin about 5 to 10 times weaker than the lunar torque, so most of the slowdown in the Earth's rotation is still due to the Moon. Of course, in the real Solar System the Sun also experiences a tidal bulge raised by the Earth, which (because the Sun rotates faster than the Earth's orbit) will accelerate the Earth forward in its orbit, also adding to the orbital angular momentum. But then you have remember that Venus and Mercury will raise larger tidal bulges on the Sun with different periods (relative to the Earth's orbit), and so the combined effect gets complicated. As for Mars and Ceres: yes, in principle the same effect would apply. But it would be weaker for Mars (smaller planetary radius, larger distance from Sun) and much weaker for Ceres (same reasons, except moreso). In addition, all of the orbits are being affected by N-body interactions with the rest of the planets (especially Jupiter), which I strongly suspect means that any potential changes in orbital angular momentum due to solar tides would be washed out by the various N-body and resonant interactions. (My understanding is that solar tidal braking could explain the current rotations of both Mercury and Venus, though you really can't be sure because you don't know what their initial rotations were.)

The primary, traditional classification for galaxies in the local universe is based on "morphology" -- in other words, on their optically visible shape; this goes back to the Hubble Sequence. I'll list the main categories and the defining shape, and then some other characteristics which are not part of the main criteria. Elliptical Galaxies: These are circular or elliptical in projected shape (ellipsoidal or triaxial in 3D shape), with no visible disk and very little gas or dust, and little or no evidence for young stars. The stars are almost all old, and tend to orbit in random directions. Very luminous/massive ellipticals tend to have centrally concentrated radial profiles in the stellar density (now usually described using Sersic profiles with high values of the index $n$); faint, low-mass "dwarf ellipticals" have more exponential stellar profiles. S0 (or Lenticular) Galaxies: These have a prominent disk of stars, but one which lacks visible spiral arms and has little or no gas or dust, and little or no evidence for young stars. The disk may, however, have one (or sometimes two) stellar bars, and sometimes rings as well. The stars are mostly old and almost all orbit in the same direction within the disk, but the orbits may be somewhat elliptical rather than circular. They almost always have a prominent "bulge" of stars dominating the middle of the galaxy; the bulge may be a very centrally concentrated part of the disk, the vertically thickened part of a stellar bar, or a round collection of old stars with mostly random orbits (somewhat like a small elliptical galaxy) -- or a combination of all three. Spiral Galaxies: These have a prominent disk of stars, gas and dust; the disk has spiral arms in it (hence the name). The subclassifications within this category (e.g., Sa vs Sb vs Sc vs Sd) are based on a combination of three factors: the relative prominence of a central bulge (if any); how tightly or loosely wound the spiral arms appear to be; and the degree to which the spiral arms are smooth versus being broken up into fragments and stellar clusters. The stars and gas almost all rotate in the same direction, with orbits that are relatively circular. They are almost always a mix of young and old stars, with new stars being formed in the disk. They may have a bulge in the center, but some do not; the bulges may be as diverse and complicated as those in S0 galaxies. Irregular Galaxies: As the name suggests, these are more raggedy, lopsided, and generally "shapeless". They are usually rich in gas, and are almost always lower in mass than the other types; they are, like spirals, often forming stars at the present time. There are a number of different kind of dwarf (= faint, low-mass) galaxies which may or may not fall neatly into the above categories. For example, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are very faint and low-mass; in terms of structure, stellar orbits, and the absence of gas or current star formation, they resemble ellipticals, but are very diffuse rather than centrally concentrated. Recent and still somewhat mysterious discoveries include "ultracompact dwarf" (UCD) galaxies and "ultradiffuse galaxies".
