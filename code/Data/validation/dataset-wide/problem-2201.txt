(The linked contract is a split contract, so that player does receive a different salary at different levels.) 

None of these end up with a double play, you'll note; a runner always ends up on second base. The only way a double play would have been possible is if the runner from first had not touched the base; then it would be a force, assuming the fielder tagged the runner from second AND the base itself (just tagging the runner is not sufficient). So, if the runner from first was in contact with the base, and the first action on the part of the fielder was to tag the runner from second (prior to touching the base with his/her foot), then the runner from second is out, and the runner from first is safe. 

I asked my friend, who played hockey in college, and she said that it is a combination of a few things: 

And while it probably didn't slow the game down that much, coaches were challenging a lot, and not winning very many challenges: 

In this particular case, the Seahawks had just lost TE Jimmy Graham for the season the week before, and as such needed to fill a spot for a TE. It seems like they signed one player, and then decided he wasn't a good fit, so moved on. They probably had to move quickly initially to get someone into practice right away, and so didn't have time to do a thorough job looking for a specific person - by the second week, they had more time to find the right person (or, two people, apparently). This sort of thing is inevitable in the NFL, and happens frequently. Compared to Major League Baseball, replacing a player in the NFL is very complicated: there isn't a minor league to draw from, or a "system". There's a small practice squad, but that squad doesn't have very many players on it, so you often have to sign a free agent if you need to fill a spot. However, NFL contracts are generally not guaranteed contracts - so there's very little cost to signing a player on a temporary basis. Teams will have a 53 man roster and 46 active players on gameday (7 inactive, which includes injured players who aren't sufficiently injured for the IR), so signing one guy and then cutting him to sign another guy doesn't really cost them anything: they'd still have that spot filled by someone, it's now just a different someone. I imagine there's a small cost in terms of paperwork and tax/etc. overhead (since NFL players make so much money, they hit the Social Security tax limit fairly quickly, even the lower paid players, so changing players every few games would have a higher tax bill) but that cost is insignificant compared to the hundreds of millions each team is making. As far as why they want to make sure and have that full 53 man roster - even if a player is unlikely to contribute on offense, it's important to make sure you have a full set of players for special teams (And a 3rd string TE is very likely to be playing on special teams). While he wasn't activated, we don't know why that is; it may have been they just had him for insurance (in case someone got hurt), or it may have been that they wanted to use him but he didn't turn out to be talented enough or learn the system well enough. Finally - don't discount the value of 'attending practice'. Having a full set of players for practice is important, so they can run plays - even if it means being on the 2nd string offense whose job it is to give the defense something to play against oftentimes. Being short a player means either a starter is doing a backup's job as well as his own, or they can't run plays as smoothly in practice. Plus of course the chance to see how good a player is. 

There is no language in the CBA preventing a player from signing with a team after an option is not exercised. A few examples of this: 

It is always possible to define a faceoff winner, because the definition of a faceoff win is simply whichever team first has possession of the puck (a brief possession is sufficient, anything longer than a deflection). That must happen following a faceoff, so you can always declare a winner. 

On a side note, I think that the injury bit is relevant, though I suspect it's only because the odds of scoring are so low already. NFL teams have injury risks on every play, so it doesn't really make sense to try a play when you don't need to AND it won't give you a benefit. I think it would be hard to prove that coaches use this reason for kneel downs without asking them; but Bill Barnwell in the many Thank You For Not Coaching articles since 2013 certainly thinks it's relevant, and if he does, that's good enough for me. 

If you allowed eligible players to line up wherever they wanted, and allowed ineligible players to not be on the line, it would make it more difficult for the defense to determine who they should cover. 

This question is likely referring to this game between Northwestern and Wisconsin on 11/21/2015. Mike Pereira (a former NFL VP of officiating) notes on twitter, for example: 

The only rule in the NHL Rulebook that I could find addressing this situation is that a goal is disallowed if it goes in directly off of an official. 

I'm not sure where you get the idea that American football has meaningful links to association football (American soccer). It shares a name, sure, but otherwise it is much closer to Rugby (Union/League) Football - both in its rules and in its historical roots. However, I suspect the issue at hand is primarily that it's hard to define what would be called a "hat trick". Quarterbacks frequently throw three touchdowns in a game; so that's out due to its frequency. Hat tricks, in most sports, are difficult to achieve; for example, only 56 hat tricks have been achieved in Ruby World Cup history. In comparison, 179 QBs have thrown for 5 touchdowns or more in a single game, and over three thousand have thrown three. As for other feats - it's hard to say why a phrase didn't catch on, but I suspect because there are simply too many things going on in one game. I've certainly heard the phrase use in its common meaning - "three of anything happening" - to refer to sacks and interceptions; it's probably been used in other circumstances as well. This is similar to other American sports; baseball often uses it to mean three strikeouts in one game, which is pretty silly (as that's not a good stat, and it's a very common one) and to mean three home runs in one game (which at least makes more sense), but even three steals in one game might be called a hat trick. But in American football, what else are you going to call a hat trick other than passing touchdowns? Receiving touchdowns, rushing touchdowns, picks, sacks, made FGs... the number of things that it could be attached to is too large, likely, for it to have been attached to just one thing. The sports that it has become commonplace in are primarily sports with one major action - goal scoring - that is fairly infrequent. Cricket is to some extent the exception - and that's because it is the origin of the term, likely. 

It also is a "signal" to fans to not expect the team to compete and win; GMs or other team executives often want to make sure it's clear they're not trying to win in the short term, because otherwise their jobs may be at stake. If you signal a "rebuild", that may earn you a few more years (if people think it was a good idea and like your rebuilding plan, anyway). Some teams avoid "rebuild" and instead "refresh" or "retool". The Chicago White Sox are a good example of this: they went through several "retools" since 2005, where the team seemed to have fallen apart and the GM decided to be aggressive in the trade/free agent market rather than a full rebuild. This is often the case in mid-market teams, where an extended losing period might cost too many fans (in particular in a two-team market like Chicago, where the Cubs have the better presence, and so the White Sox need to pretend at least to be competitive). It's often hard to do this for long periods of time, unless you have nearly unlimited salaries available, because constant retooling means you never lose enough games to get high draft picks.

If the defensive team's manager plans to appeal the play, he/she should let an umpire know in a timely manner. 

In the case you noted above, the error was noticed before the next time the ball became live, so the official should have stopped the game immediately, corrected the error, then continued play (with the second free throw). I suspect the referees felt that the rebound and shot meant that a 'live ball' situation had occurred and thus the play wasn't correctable any longer. However, they have until the next live ball beyond that, even if they ruled the incorrect live ball counted as a live ball situation - which it probably shouldn't. 

A loose ball is out of bounds when it touches a player who is out of bounds. That means that in the first scenario, that ball instantly is out of bounds - it has touched a player out of bounds. It doesn't matter that it's the offensive player. However, if the ball was determined to be in possession of the defensive player, the rule is different: 

When replay was being re-considered, in 1996, not only did they try to do a better job of getting calls correct, but they also added the following rule: 

Against the Spread tells you how a team plays against the spread - so if you gave them their spread points for each game, what would their record then be? For example (made up numbers):
