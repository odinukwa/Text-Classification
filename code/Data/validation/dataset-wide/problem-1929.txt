It's almost inappropriate to list the job. Your resume is meant to provide (a) your experiences, and (b) what you've done with your time. While it's true that having a hole in your timeline is cause for concern under (b), plenty of people will have a gap of a week or so between jobs. Even when someone leaves one job for another, it's not uncommon to take a little break. After enough decades, you'll leave off jobs simply because they're no longer relevant (that COBOL experience on a PDP probably won't help land the next big position). It's clear that your three days is irrelevant. 

For late-stage candidates, there's a technique that's intended to eliminate biases arising from naturally getting along with one candidate more than another, but it works here as well. Make a short checklist of the qualifications for each person--basically a three to five word resume, focusing on their distinguishing traits. So you might compare two developers where A was more experienced and worked on mobile apps, where B was better in start-ups and scaling. You pick who you think you're leaning toward, say A. You then reverse the lists. Would you still want A with B's skills, and by as much? You may have been leaning heavily toward A and now only slighly toward B. If so, then you like A, not A's skills. For sales, that may mean A is a better fit--A sold you on the job regardless of skills. For most other positions, your bias is preventing you from deciding. You can hand off the decision having narrowed down the field, or try to imagine the person with the opposite characteristics of your former colleagues. Replace quiet with loud... still want them? Replace passive with forceful, etc. Hiring correctly is worth enormous efforts. You don't want to pass up someone good or hire someone inappropriate for whatever reason. Look things over carefully and really let things sink in, and play mental games trying to talk yourself in and out of everyone. You'll pretty quickly see your weak spots and learn to naturally compensate. 

Apply all the normal throw clearings of "I'm not an attorney" and "this is not legal advice" ... I can't imagine there's a jurisdiction in the world that can or should extend "rights" to a candidate as to when an interview is to be held. If they were really interested in you, or your skills were particularly hard to find, they would be more accommodating out of necessity. Consider yourself lucky. Not many companies advertise that they are going to be inflexible right from the outset. 

Scrum can be very useful, but it's a round peg in a world with a few square holes. Scrum is great when there's a large amount of ongoing work, divided between roughly similar people, and when partitioning or prioritizing that work is difficult. Although that describes a good number of teams, it doesn't describe your work. I have been on both sides of the fence in this exact situation, where scrum is being misapplied. It's usually obvious in a few sprints. Your legitimate gripes are being confused with the normal "this is useless", anti-process, anti-scrum blowback that is fairly common when teams start. So you'll have to let that phase pass on its own. To argue your way out, I'd focus on the benefits to your team and management of the process, and how you're ahead on that. They key benefits are visibility, speed, flexibility and predictability. How do you propose addressing those? Why did you management choose scrum in the first place? Answer those questions and you can probably wriggle through getting your work pulled from the meetings. On the flip side, you may still be useful in contributing to the conversation for everyone else's benefit, and the work that isn't yours. I imagine you have some skills that overlap, and you'll have a bit of an outsider perspective, while still being technical. That can be helpful for their sake, and would show good citizenship on your side. Continuing that a few weeks longer may help, and maybe then your managers will realize it is/isn't worth the investment of your time. 

The backup of the servers & support, etc., are either in the contract or not. If yes, you're being asked to change the product so it's no longer in compliance with the contract. Your business needs to decide if violating and losing the contract is worth the risk--punitive terms are likely in the contract itself. If no, then the backups & support, etc., are for your insurance, not the client's. If the client thinks your service quality is low, the client may opt to leave. That's a rational business decision on both sides. You may even offer to change hosts back for a re-negotiated price. That's also a rational business decision on both sides. Your company's reputation may be damaged, and it may not, but that's a business decision. Your reputation is worth a lot, but you may have to take a dent to keep the lights on. Your professional integrity only comes into play in whether you (a) highlight the issues/downsides to your management, and whether you (b) tell the truth when asked about the service change to everyone and anyone. 

You have, if you're controlling the deployment of the work, a metaphorical bully pulpit. You can simply reject the logo on copyright grounds, and not put it on the site. Tell the designer that the work failed a copyright check, and they'll need to take it to management to get approval before it can be posted. 

There is no substitute for knowing your own value. You're assuming your low-ball salary has something to do with his cut. In all likelihood, he's getting a percentage, and gets more when you get more. Not always, but it's beside the point. You are being placed in at a low rate because (a) it makes the recruiter look good to the company, because he finds A-level talent a B-level prices, and (b) he's likely to close the deal quickly. He's also probably told the company to expect to pay more than average, so when you come in low, you look like a steal, and you're working asap. This is a sales job. You are a product. If I can get a 10% commission on phones regardless of the price, I'd be selling iPhones for $20. Sure, I make very little per phone, but I'd be selling 100x more phones, and I'd come out way ahead. There is no substitute for knowing your own value. 

Simply cancel, the sooner the better. The company can likely exchange the ticket for the next candidate, or another purpose. If not, interviewing at this point will only waste time and money. For instance, "Thank you for your consideration. Since we spoke I have received and accepted an offer that is very in line with my personal and professional goals. I hope that you did not go to too great an expense or effort. I hope we will get an opportunity to work together in the future." 

Swing and a miss! You negotiated for more, and they didn't accept. Sounds like they're not going to. Your best bet is to wait in silence. If they're interested and can't find someone else at that price point, they may reach out again. It's unlikely, but it has happened. There's no real benefit in contacting them, they're likely to sense an upper hand and either back down on the price or just walk away.
