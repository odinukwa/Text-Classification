Yes, you can. I use a Newtonian reflector, 200mm objective, 1000mm focal length. Uranus is sometimes right on the fringe of naked eye but looks a lot clearer as a small but recognisable blueish disc. Neptune, sadly, just looks like a star to me ... but you can find it. 

This is a slightly tricky one. For a conventional Newtonian reflector, shining a laser collimator back over the secondary to the primary should present a small dot on the primary - the task then is to adjust the secondary to center the dot on the primary - there is hopefully a mark on the primary. This is a reasonable general primer: $URL$ HOWEVER, the 114 is special, having a Barlow lens embedded in the bottom of the focuser. This would have the effect of spreading the laser light back into the telescope, leading to a projected shape (a disk or oval) on the primary. It's not really possible to conclude whether the collimator is collimated from this. Reading the manual ( $URL$ ), the manufacturer recommends a simple sight test: remove the eyepiece, and look down the focuser, adjusting the primary to center your eye (hence not worrying about the secondary alignment). Alternatively, you should be able to remove the Barlow lens by racking the focus tube all the way out and unscrewing it (do remember which way around it is mounted ...), which would allow the use of the laser. Simplest solution would be to use a low tech Cheshire collimator, I think. These forum discussions might give useful background: $URL$ $URL$ 

NASA's predictions for the August 2017 solar eclipse show that about half of Kansas City will see a total eclipse and the other half won't (they'll just see a "near" total eclipse, perhaps even Bailey's Beads?). I thought this would be a great way of testing how accurate NASA's eclipse path prediction is: have people in Kansas City report, with location, whether they saw a total eclipse or not (of course, many people in Kansas City will probably head into the total eclipse zone just to see it, but hopefully few will remain outside it). It then occurred to me that someone must've already done this for previous eclipses (I know it's done for lunar occultations of other stars). However, googling only tells me that NASA's 2017 path predictions are more accurate than ever before, but not actually HOW accurate they are. Where can I find data about accuracy of eclipse predictions? 

In our solar system, the answer to this depends on how you define "annular eclipse" (as opposed to transit). I wrote $URL$ to see how big planets' moons appear compared to the sun. The full results: $URL$ Planet/moon combinations closest to annular eclipse (note these numbers are averages, not ranges): 

The Gary Seronik website that you cite is a good one - it's not leading you astray! There are a couple of important things to look at: 

Hmm - good question, Michael; and thanks for sharing your images with us. For me, it's about eliminating possible causes: 

I don't think stellar parallax would directly help us as it (in the modern day) just tells us that we are in orbit around the sun and little about the Earth-Moon system itself. Let's look at how a Ptolemy equivalent on the Moon (call him Moon-Ptolemy) might see it. He would have no way of distinguishing the Earth-Moon system from his assumption that he is just sitting on a solid object at the center of creation. Of course he wouldn't see a "moon" in orbit around him, but he would see the Sun, stars and major planets. Stellar parallax (to him, the Sun "moving through the Zodiac) would just tell him that Sun is rotating around his Moon, as are the planets. The existence of planetary epicycles would be a curiosity required to make his model work - but it does work and he has no notion of the Earth Moon-Galileo might (or might not) be able to develop the heliocentric model - he misses out on one key insight that Earth-Galileo had: that the Earth wasn't special because other planets also had moons. Moon-Galileo would find the orbital system of Jupiter interesting but not a key insight, so he might not develop the new model. Even so, someone else would. Nevertheless, in a qualitative scientific world, there would still be nothing to help the Moon observer deduce the existence of the Earth behind the horizon. I suspect the truth would become unavoidable when orbital mechanics developed sufficiently to incorporate mass and gravity into calculation. It might have been around the time of Moon-Kepler. I'm not sure I agree with the comments looking at observations of the planets - I don't see how they help distinguish between an Earth-Moon system as opposed to a simple, very large, rotating Moon body with no co-orbiter (which would be a natural assumption to make). Even the monthly changes in parallax caused by the rotation of the Moon around the Earth might be waved away by suggesting the simple rotation of a much larger Moon body - though our hero might certainly question the compatibility of this with the apparent curvature and distance to their Moon horizon. 

This frustrated me as well when I first used the Tycho-2 catalog. Not finding a well known bright star can be disconcerting. Quoting from $URL$ 

where the light blue circle is the Earth, the small blue dot is the geocenter, the black dot in the blue circle is the center of the ellipse, the black ellipse is the orbit of the satellite, and the two black dots on the ellipse are the perigee and final positions of the satellite respectively. Even allowing for the Earth's rotation in the 90 minute timefram, I'm not sure anyone on Earth could see the satellite both at perigee and at its final location. I'm working on a more complete answer at $URL$ 

You probably got this far yourself, but here is my absolutely wild speculative guess on why this could be 24 May 1587 on the Gregorian calendar: 

The star is slightly variable, but not enough to explain the following discrepancy: If the star's magnitude at 32.6 light years is -2.79 (definition of absolute magnitude), it would be about 9.6 times fainter at 101.06 light years (it's actual distance from us). However, that's only about 2.5 magnitudes fainter, nowhere near enough to bring it down to magnitude 4.66. What's happening here, and is this a one-off special case, or does this happen a lot? For reference, my calculation of the apparent magnitude: 

Are there stars - in our galaxy, as stars in other galaxies are not individually visible - that are 'dead' but still alight to us. The Slate article you linked is rather good in this respect: i) the lifespan of a given star is much longer than the time taken for light to reach us so it is unlikely that this is the case and ii) most stars have an extended extinction compared to the time taken for light to reach us, with few going out in a supernova flash. Hence it is pretty unlikely that this is the case at the moment - but it will happen on occasion If there is a specific star which is 'dead' but still alight to us - could we know? Not really, as no useful information will be travelling to us faster than the speed of light. The best we might do is to observe a supernova and then say "this event happened x years ago" 

Don't worry about only having one support rather than four. The key will be to identify your centre dot (you can just see it on Seronik's webpage, first picture ) and to see how it is centred when you look through the collimation cap onto the secondary. Maybe read this article: $URL$ Or search for Newtonian Collimation on Youtube? 

when the local sideral time is almost a minute ahead of the sun's right ascension. What's going on here? Since the Earth is an ellipsoid, and not a sphere, it turns out that "up", the direction perpendicular to a location on Earth, is NOT directly away from the center of the Earth (it turns out gravity acts in a direction that is neither towards the center of the Earth nor perpendicular to the surface, but that's not relevant for this question): see $URL$ for details. If you want really accurate calculations you'll have to use $URL$ 's $URL$ function. Although this doesn't cause the discrepancy above, another consideration is a location's elevation above the surface of the Earth, which can also have slight effect (since "up" isn't always towards the zenith). Happily, one thing you can ignore is refraction, since refraction at the zenith is effctively zero. My $URL$ is a very approximate representation of where the Sun is overhead and is generated by $URL$ 

Both of these look similar to my answer, so I'm reasonably confident that I'm correct this time. $URL$ if anyone wants to check my work Things to note: 

In theory, yes; in practice probably not ... i) It's perhaps helpful to take the Andromeda galaxy as a first working example. It is somewhat bigger than our own Milky Way galaxy but not so big as to be a problem. When we look at Andromeda, it appears to occupies an area about 3 degrees by 1 degree. By comparison, the Moon appear about 0.5 degree across. Andromeda is a good target to see, a little faint but it is just about visible with the naked eye on a good night. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away so, even travelling at the speed of light, it would take 2.5 million years to get far away enough from the Milky Way so we could look back and see our galaxy like we see Andromeda today. ( In Star Trek, the writers seemed broadly to limit themselves to adventures within our galaxy for the same reason: within the realms of sci-fi, perhaps they could justify getting around the Milky Way within a reasonable period of time - not so to travel between the galaxies ) ii) To reduce the apparent size of our galaxy to a dot would require travelling at least 10x further or probably more - depending on how you are observing. 50 million light years, anyone? 

OLD ANSWER FOR REFERENCE (note that Sirius does not have known exoplanets, so the Sirius solution I propose below wouldn't work): As others have noted, since Sirius is 25 times more luminous than our Sun (though still not luminous as Canopus or Rigel), so it would be the brightest star for most nearby star systems, and all the exoplanets we've found are fairly closeby. The only possible exception would be an exoplanet orbiting Sirius itself, since Sirius would be considered their sun, and not a star in the night sky. Unfortunately, Sirius' smaller companion, Sirius B, would be much brighter than our Sun there. I'm also pretty sure Sirius B would be in the night sky (not just in the daytime sky), so it would count. I'd like to poke around a bit more before declaring this answer complete. I think I can show that any point where the Sun is brighter than Sirius must be less than 4.3 light years (and probably much less) away from our solar system, so, unless we discover an star system MUCH closer than Proxima Centauri, there are no exoplanets where our Sun is the brightest star. 

According to CalSky ($URL$ there were two Iridium flares visible low in the south-east from Minneapolis at 21:18 (Iridium 60) and 22:28 (Iridium 55) on that evening. Both would have been about 15 degrees elevation and both in the right ballpark for brightness. Iridium flares occur when the rising / setting Sun's rays bounce off the antennae or solar panels of one or other of the Iridium communications satellites. By their very nature they occur around dusk or dawn. They'll flare up, persist for a few seconds and fade away. 

Firstly, if you're planet spotting, don't worry too much about light pollution. The planets are some of the brightest objects in the sky and some (especially Jupiter) can easily be observed even with a full Moon - the full Moon (along with the Sun!) is the biggest contributor to light pollution! Take a look at the list of brightest stars ( $URL$ ), which also contains estimates for the brightness of the Sun, Moon and major planets. There aren't typically any stars brighter from Earth than Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Mercury and precious few brighter than Saturn. I'm going to suggest you probably have seen many of the planets - but just didn't recognise them. +1 for Stellarium ( $URL$ ). It's free, intuitive and very visual to use. You can put in your local viewing location and it gives you a view for any time of the night, future or past. At the time of writing (23 July 2017), Saturn and Jupiter should be looking good for the Southern Hemisphere. This rotates throughout the year, and Stellarium will help with this. Do a web search for "the sky at night in the southern hemisphere" and you'll find a number of examples of websites with highlights to look for when you get out. Couple of final suggestions: 

This doesn't really answer your question, but the orientation of the moon is changing constantly, because we tend to compare the moon to the horizon, and think of the horizon as fixed. Here's a video demonstrating the effect (simulated) for the full moon over London on August 28-29 (all times GMT): $URL$ If you were changing location, you would see a similar gradual effect. The only real place you would see a true "flip" is near where the moon is at zenith (overhead), because, as you passed the zenith point, the moon may go from being 89.999 degrees high in the western sky to 89.999 degrees high in the eastern sky (and flip directions because you're now comparing it to a different horizon). Realistically, when the moon is that high, you probably wouldn't be comparing it to the nearest horizon. 

So why would the author write "month of moon in Taurus" instead of the actual month name? It's possible he was trying to be careful, since the months would be different in the many countries still using the Julian calendar. Of course, it may just be a reference to the lunar eclipse of 24 Mar 1587: $URL$
