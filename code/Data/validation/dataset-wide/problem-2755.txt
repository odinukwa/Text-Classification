Here's a quote from Hofstadter's Metamagical Themas (1985) where he provides a definition of superrationality: You need to depend not just on their being rational, but on their depending on everyone else to be rational, and on their depending on everyone to depend on everyone to be rational - and so on. A group of reasoners in this relationship to each other I call superrational. Superrational thinkers, by recursive definition, include in their calculations the fact that they are in a group of superrational thinkers. (Chapter 30) Prior to this, the idea appeared a number of times, dating back to Hume. See the linked SEP article for a discussion. I will present two mentions from the economics literature. In 2005, Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann shared the Nobel prize in economics for "having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis" (see the press release). Schelling in particular can be credited with preempting Hofstadter's definition of superrationality in coordination games: 

Not really. The idea had emerged several times in philosophy, economics and mathematics before Hofstadter wrote about it. Notably, Martin Gardener wrote about a puzzle involving the notion in Scientific American in the 70s, in the same column that Hofstadter ultimately took over and wrote about superrationality in. A good place to start would be SEP's entry on Common Knowledge. 

In John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's classic, the Theory Of Games And Economic Behavior (1944), both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory are introduced and explored. The full text is available online. 

What is this trying to achieve? The point of Descartes is that at this point in his systematic doubt he reached a point from which he gained certainty of something: That he exists, at least as a thinking thing (res cogitans). This is still true when you doubt that you are doubting: Maybe there is an evil demon trying to trick me, but maybe there isn't. Whatever it is, I can be sure of at least one thing: my existence. 

Humanity is not identical to the universe (universe is way bigger), although we are a part of it. So you can say: A little part of the universe is trying to discover the universe. 

What other questions are regarded as fundamental (nowadays*) by contemporary philosophers? *Since this particular question is new in the sense that neither philosphers in the antiquity nor middle-age philosophers addressed it. 

I am looking for contemporary proponents of the following thesis: Identity statements such as "a = b" are to be interpreted metalingustically, for example as "the names "a" and "b" are coreferential". (as opposed to: "object a is identical to object b") I know that Frege hold this view in the Begriffsschrift and that he argues against it in the beginning of Über Sinn und Bedeutung (On Sense and Reference). However, I'd like to know whether there are contemporary proponents who argue for a metalinguistic interpretation of identity statements. 

TL;DR: Assuming the axiom of choice, the answer is No for First Order PA. Given the axiom of choice, every cardinal can be identified with a unique ordinal. So an easier question is to ask is if the class of ordinal numbers can be represented in PA. The set of ordinals representable in PA is Kleene's O, the recursive ordinals. This set is bounded above by a limit ordinal ω1CK, which is still countable and thus less than &aleph;1. So using recursive ordinals, PA cannot express even the smallest uncountable cardinality. 

It's a bit of an exageration to say that there was a clear consensus regarding Aristotelian logic up through the late 19th century. Throughout the middle ages, scholars argued over the correct interpretation of Aristotle's Organon. SEP has a nice summary in its article, Medieval Theories of the Syllogism. In particular, Peter of Abelard held there were multiple forms of negation and rejected the logical equivalence of "extinctive" double negation in certain cases (here's an excerpt from the Cambridge Companion to Abelard regarding his logic). Abelard also embraced a form of relevance logic: the idea that in an argument the premises must somehow relate to the conclusion. This anticipates formal relevance logic in the 20th century; see SEP for details. Subsequently Abelard and other medieval logicians tended to reject ex contradictione quodlibet, otherwise known as Hilbert's "Principle of Explosion". Graham Priest has a brief history of this in his SEP entry on Paraconsistent Logic. A related to semantic issue is the slow adoption of the truth functional interpretation of logical connectives. While this was embraced by Stoics (along with bivalence), it was essentially forgotten by the middle ages. As consequentialist readings of Aristotle came to dominate, it eventually found a resurgence. Modal logic was also a point of contention for the ancients. Under modern interpretations of modal logic, it seems that Aristotle's ideas regarding the validity and invalidity of certain BARBARA patterns make no sense (here is a little exposition on this). Finally, bivalence was not universally accepted - the Catuskoti can be understood as a precursor to modern Dunn/Belnap 4 valued logic. 

First it is to note that some reports do not suffice to suspend an account. He has to have behaved often so bad that others reported him. Second, the argument is valid (I'd say), but it is not based more on P1 than on P3. So it is true. If he hadn't played with you, he would not have been reported. But at the same time if he hadn't used abusive language, he would not have been reported. Also you could question that it is true that low-level players are more likely to report abusive language. 

To be an academic philosopher, you need to socialize with other academic philosophers (which is quite a skill), you need writing skills to write essays and books, and you need presenting skills to give talks at conferences. Furthermore, you need some source from which the ideas come which you write about and talk about. That may be creativity or something else. 

The argument: P1 Playing with you causes the matchmaking to include people of lower levels in the opposed team P2 Low-Level player are more likely to report abusive language P3 He uses abusive language Conclusion: By 1-3, he got reported.

The difference is that in the first example, all quantifiers are in the front and that in the second the quantifier appears within the scope of the other quantifier. Is there a difference? If so, where?
