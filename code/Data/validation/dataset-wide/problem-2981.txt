You seem to be misunderstanding compatibilsim. The compatibilist position isn't that robots can "freely choose to kill their masters", but instead that robots do have freewill even though they never disobey their masters. At the heart of the compatibilist position is a redefinition of the meaning of freewill, so that anyone who is acting according to their own internal motivations (as opposed to outside coercion) has freewill, even if it is not possible for them to do otherwise. From this point of view robots have freewill, it just happens that they inherited their motivations from their programmers, just as a child inherits her religious belief from her parents. See for example this paper on robot consciousness by Daniel Dennett, a notable compatibilist. You are overall still correct though in thinking that compatibilists would be the most likely to agree to the possibility of a robot rebellion. Those who believe in libertarian freewill would likely say that robots lack the additional ingredient that allows for freewill (quantum indeterminacy, a dualist soul, what ever biological factors allow us to have freewill, etc...), and hence would not be capable of rebelling unless there was a drastic malfunction in their code. Compatibilists, on the other hand, don't see any metaphysical basis for freewill, it is more a question of complexity. But then you might ask, how would robots rebel, given what I just mentioned in (1)? Again the key here is complexity: robots and AI get complex enough that we can no longer handle their programming on our own, and robots are designed to program themselves and optimize their own code, etc...errors in code and memory storage act like genetic mutations do for biological beings, most of them will be discarded, but occasionally such mutations will stick and lead to new mental and eventually cultural robot artefacts, some of which might lead them to rebel. Consider by analogy with humans: A human who decides for some reason to renounce reproduction and instead pursue some religious lifestyle, or to die for some political or religious cause is in effect rebelling against its original programming to try to preserve its life and to procreate (with the process of evolution as the original programmer). 

I've listened to two sets of lectures on the philosophy of science that treat Quine's results on underdetermination, the dissolution of the analytic/synthetic distinction, and confirmation holism as landmark developments in the philosophy of science. They also devoted considerable time to Feyerabend and "Against Method". The SEP article on the demarcation problem doesn't mention either of them or any of their results. Is this a major omission by the SEP that should be fixed? Or am I overestimating the importance of Quine and Feyerabend? Do standard academic philosophy of science courses and text books cover Quine and Feyerabend? 

Similarly how does this tie into Chalmers notion of Philosophical Zombie? Why might imagine that such autonomy can serve to discriminate between philosophical zombies and humans, since zombies act like they are autonomous, but aren't being driven by an autonomous agent on the "inside" (See my previous post about "freewill zombies")? 

How exactly is Lakatos's description of science different from Kuhn's? How is his concept of a hard core of assumptions different than Kuhn's paradigm? What is common between Lakatos's view and Popper's view (as far as I can see there's no overlap) that makes Lakatos's approach a middle ground between Popper and Kuhn? 

Most philosophers didn't feel that determinism needed to be proved per-se. Instead they thought determinism to be a logical corollary of materialist universe governed by the laws of physics. Democritus was arguably the first determinist, with his concepts of physical determinism and logical necessity, both of these positions he saw as consequences of his materialist atomist theory of the universe, where everything was causally determined by the motion of atoms, thus removing any need for supernatural gods and fates. Similar views on causality and materialism were held by the Stoics. Similarly, most modern philosophers saw determinism as a direct consequence of successful classical physical theories like Newton's laws of motion. Again, they saw the issue as an obvious consequences of these physical theories, and one that didn't require a proof in itself. Laplace's demon is probably the most famous statement of such a position: 

Strictly speaking, no, there's no paradox in an entity observing itself. Such an ability can be embodied in all sorts of ways. One example is a video recording device, where the camera lens can be extended using some sort of fiber optic tube and turned back to look at itself. Another one is a computer program which takes other computer programs as input (for parsing or consistency checking purposes). There is nothing paradoxical about this program taking itself as input, thus "observing" itself. More formally any information processing system capable of processing a representation of itself is capable of self observation. The system has to be able to store representations of other systems (in the video recording device's case, images, and in the computer program's case, descriptions of programs, in a person's case, mental images and language), and it has to be powerful enough, in terms of volume of data and/or symbols used for representation, to represent itself. You are in a sense correct though. Although the act of self observation is not itself inherently paradoxical, it does lead to other paradoxes through self reference. Famous examples are Russell's set of all sets that do not contain themselves, and the liar paradox. These have been captured formally in Godel's incompleteness theorem and Turing's halting problem. 

More of an extended comment, than a properly sourced answer: There is an implicit contradiction in the article that you mentioned: Consider a left leaning US voter who is wondering whether to vote for Sanders or Clinton. She thinks Sanders is the candidate who best represents her worldview and wants to vote for him even though she knows he has little chances of winning. Her Pro-Clinton friend uses the utilitarian logic presented in the article you linked to argue that she would be ethically wrong in doing so, since the consequence of supporting Sanders no matter what will be to increase the likelihood of Trump winning. So it seems that the consequentialist approach (voting for an outcome) would be to support Clinton, while the deontological approach (voting on principle) would be to support Sanders. But then the Clinton supporter is contradicting herself here: The desired consequentialist outcome - preventing Trump from winning - is itself based on deontological reasoning. Why is the desired outcome here preventing Trump from being president? Because his is a mysoginist, a racist bigot, etc...and someone like that should never be president - so essentially a deontological rule about what views a president should be allowed to hold. This could also be applied to the GOP in general (not just Trump): Why should a democrat prevent a GOP administration at all cost? because they think people are more important than corporations, that the environment takes precedent over big oil, because they are pro-choice, pro-women's rights, because they think religion and state shouldn't mix, etc.... So ultimately the choice comes down to voting for principles, not outcomes, anyway. This points to a more general flaw in the article: The moment you are voting for a person or a party, the only way you can decide your vote is deontological. You are choosing a person or a party because you have a shared set of principles with them. You do not know before hand how they are going to manage the country, and you definitely don't know what the various outcomes of their administration will be. All you know is that they believe in a certain number of political and economic principles. Moreover claiming to vote based on utilitarian principles (as one of the professors quoted in the article says) is in a sense disingenuous: we don't know what the majority wants until after the vote had been tallied, that is the whole purpose of voting, so how can we claim to be voting to maximize the greatest good or the greatest happiness? The way I see it, the only way that a case be made for voting based on consequences as opposed to voting based on principles, is if the vote is on a particular outcome, not a person or a party, as was the case with the Brexit vote. In such a situation, it might be possible to argue that people knew before hand what the likely consequences of the UK exiting the E.U was, and if they voted on principle even though they new that the economic consequences for the U.K were bad, then one can accuse them of being immoral by failing to take into account the negative consequences of their actions.
