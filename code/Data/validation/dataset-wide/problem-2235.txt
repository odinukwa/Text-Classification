I would've thought that the combination of contact lenses and goggles would be a good solution as long as you can get used to wearing contacts. Anecdotally, I know plenty of racket-sport players who use contact lenses instead of glasses, my wife included. She insists they are better than glasses particularly because when wearing glasses, the ball/shuttle will be hard to track through her peripheral vision in which it becomes both blurry and slightly offset. I am an occasional contact lens wearer, for night cycling. I'm not aware of any serious health objections to contact lenses, provided good hygiene practice is followed. However, some people find contact lenses difficult to wear even after a period of adjustment/practice. If they are really not for you, it appears it is possible to get prescription squash goggles. 

If you have an existing weakness or vulnerability to ankle injuries you could consider wearing an ankle support or doing specific exercises to strengthen it. Note that I'm not a physiotherapist and you would do well to consult one to check that my general advice is appropriate to your situation. 

There are some improvements in technique that you can use, although they'll take practice. This page describes good lunging technique to move efficiently and prevent injury. With regards to keeping your ankles safe, pay particular attention to the following: 

I can't say with any authority how much difference the surface you play on would make, but I think you can build up injuries on any surface. Badminton is a high-impact sport and, anecdotally, I've seen that playing for years can lead to joint (especially knee) problems, such as: $URL$ Good shoes may help, as long as they fit well (so your foot doesn't slide around inside). Getting some help on proper footwork may also be worthwhile. For example, you should put your heel down first when lunging to encourage your foot to point in the direction you are lunging. 

I've heard reports of amateur players who are ambidextrous swapping a tennis racket from one hand to the other to have two forehands. I don't know about squash and tennis, but in badminton there's no rule banning moving the racket between your left and right hands. The reason is probably because, except perhaps at beginner level, there's no advantage to doing so. The shuttle moves quickly and it is relatively easy to disguise your shot, so players don't have much time to work out where the next shot is going and swap hands. Another reason may be that there are very few ambidextrous players and they'd have to practise specially to do this. Certainly my other hand forehand is much worse than my dominant hand backhand. 

What I would do, not necessarily what will work for you, would be to practice keeping your eyes open for the single somersault, until you get comfortable with that and figure out what works for you. During your take off you should look forward and focus on one point that catches your eyes so that you know when to kick out. So I would continue to practice this until you find out what works for you during the single somersaults, and then once you have figured out how to keep your eyes open for that, I would then advance to the double somersaults and try the same technique that was used to work for the single somersault. This may take a lot of time, and may be a little frustrating at times as it sounds as you have developed performing them with closed eyes as a habit, but having opened eyes definitely makes the double much easier (at least for me). 

Knowing how much vertical jumping is important in basketball, some safe plyometric workouts for 10-12 y/o kids would be to have them squat down and jump up as high as possible while reaching up with one or both hands and hit a flag or a point directly above them. Then, upon landing, immediately jump up again and attempt to reach higher. It is important to use both upper and lower body movement, to keep landings short, and to perform multiple jumps in succession. Another exercise to work on quick muscle twitching, and foot speed would be to have them run various ladder drills. Some good drills include:

It all really depends on what kind of running you are doing. I know that there are some who run distance workouts and take two days off in-between, but I also know some who do tempo interval workouts and take one day off a week. The long run can be the most beneficial, but also can cause the most damage if done too hard, too long, and too frequently. So you can continue doing your individual workout, especially if it seems to be working for you, but be careful with your body as to not overwhelm it. You only get one haha. Throwing some sporadic tempo interval runs may be beneficial for you, as training in only one area may decrease your abilities in another. Many believe there is only one way to run, but there are many different factors and abilities that are tested. Having tempo interval runs will allow you to work on running through tiredness towards the end of the race, and force you to focus on your running form, which one may not necessarily work on if they simply do distance runs and nothing else. 

Usually what is call a friendly match is a game outside a tournament. Like in many other sports, this kind of game is usually used as a test for both team. Usually in this kind of game, although all the rule book is used, sometimes there are a relax in some rules, like quantity of substitutes, and many times both team plays in a relaxed way, and the refeere usually donÂ´t show as many yellow and red cards. Some games, like the ones that are the last one for a player, includes several more relaxed rules, like the player playing for both team, or an unlimited number of replacement players. The last one are usually not call friendly match, are better know as tribute match. 

Maybe golf when you play foursome or fourball?? they are not playing all at the same time, but that's because how the field is made. At least they are all playing one after another, and in groups. They all are playing against each other. 

The size of the picth is not evenly in every field. There are maximum and minimun size. told us about it: Dimensions The touchline must be longer than the goal-line. Length (touchline): minimum 90m (100yds) maximum 120m (130yds) Length (goal-line): minimum 45m (50yds) maximum 90m (100yds) Dimensions for international matches Length (touchline): minimum 100m (100yds) maximum 110m (120yds) Length (goal-line): minimum 64m (70yds) maximum 75m (80yds) Competitions may determine the length of the goal-line and touchline within the above dimensions. 

Futsal is a very "quick" sport. Usually players has to run a lot (like in basketball). That's why this kind of sports has a big rotation of players on the field. If you are playing friendly, the last defender could be a nice position, only covering your own half and helping attacking from the center of the field. If you need a rest, being a goalkeeper is the easiest position to rest, since you barely leave the penalty area. That's always depends on the type of game you are playing. If you are playing in a league, you will have to make sure your teammates doesn't fill all the positions you can handle. Or make sure that the team has replacement players. If you have a good goalkeeper (this position needs a lot of reflex, the ball in this game goes very fast), then stick to be the last defender. And start training to regain your fitness. 

What rule should I apply in a situation like this. I know i very uncommon, but I should not touch the ball. Could be the plastic be considered a mobile obstruction? The ball is clearly inside the hole. 

According to this on line newspaper (that has his corresponding real version), the record is holded by a team with 7 penalties (but it doesn't said in how many matches). But it has info about this team, Talleres de cordoba, who in 1952 has 6 penalties in 5 consecutives matches.
