Difficulty is hard to say, but the reason a laser might work is because the laser is supposed to melt one side of the comet, which, as it melts, gas particles fly off at relatively high velocity, which redirects the momentum of the comet somewhat. It's not the pressure from the laser, it's the heat from the laser and the fact that comets are made largely from ice, which can be melted or "zapped" into fast moving jets of gas. The approach wouldn't be a laser on or orbiting Earth shooting comets from a great distance but spacecrafts flying up close to the comet and using lasers to target one side. It would be difficult to fire a laser so pinpoint as to target one side of the comet from earth and create localized heat that would create the necessary directional out-gassing. This article proposes spacecraft, perhaps several, flying adjacent to the comet. A nuclear weapon would be way more effective, however, depending on how fast we'd needed to push it. This article mentions a pulse laser landing on the comet or asteroid as well as other methods that might work. 

I'm not an expert in this, but it's a fun little blip in the history of SETI. Pretty much the only blip I think. 

What makes the periodic meteor shower is the dust trail, that follows (and precedes) the comet (not to be confused with dust tail - that's something else). Any solid debris that gets blown off the comet at low velocity enters an orbit with a very similar orbital path to the comet and over hundreds or thousands of orbits, as the comet effectively gets broken up each time it passes the sun, the comet generates a dust or debris trail that largely follows it's entire orbit, at least, that's where the greatest concentration of particles is. Not all meteor showers are periodic, but all periodic meteor showers happen in this way with a semi permanent orbiting ring of dust that the Earth flies through once a year. Dust trail (generally not visible, too spread out, unless heated by a close pass to the sun) 

Because the Moon is comfortably inside the true region of stability inside Earth's Hill Sphere, it's orbit can be considered stable. Ultimately all orbits are unstable, so, when I say it's stable, I mean, stable for hundreds of millions or billions of years. That's a nice round number. Phobos, for example, is expected to crash into Mars or break apart inside Mars' roche limit in about 10 million years. Some people call that an unstable orbit, but 10 million years is a long time. There's no precise dividing line between stable and unstable orbits, it's a term of convenience, more than accuracy. Using Kepler's laws and the Earth-Moon-Sun as an example, The Earth-Moon barycenter orbits the sun in basically a Kepler orbit. Pretty close anyway. If you want to be a stickler, it orbits the 3 body barycenter, but with the sun's mass ratio to the Earth/Moon being about 330,000 to 1, it's pretty close to just orbiting the sun. Kepler's laws are pretty close. The Moon does not orbit the Earth in a neat Kepler orbit because solar tides are significant, making the Moon's elliptical orbit pretty stretched and wobbled. The same sun-tides that affect oceans on earth affect the Lunar orbit around the Earth. This diagrams is exaggerated, so take with a grain of salt, but this is the gist of what the sun does to the Moon's orbit. It's still ellipse-ish, but visibly stretched. Apsidal precession 

The intuitive way to think about it is to understand that there are multiple changes that, in essence, amplify each other. Amplification in astronomy isn't all that uncommon. It explains why gravity can make massive objects so small, because as the massive object gets smaller, the gravitation and weight of the object grows exponentially. In a sense, the opposite happens with a Red giant. The gravity at the surface grows low enough that the star kind of enters a run-away expansion. The expansion of the star late in it's life is exponential. That's why it can expand so much. If the sun was to double in size but it's mass was to remain unchanged. In this hypothetical, the new Sun's surface gravity is divided by 4. It's escape velocity is divided by the square root of 2, so the outer layer has much less weight, but the escape velocity still binds it to the star. Everything being equal, expanding the sun should cause it to cool, but using the root mean square rule for thermal velocity, if the temperature is divided by 2, the velocity of the hydrogen and helium molecules is divided by the square root of 2. In this theoretical, they hydrogen atoms on the surface are moving slightly slower, but with 1/4 the gravity, they're more free and they can move further from the star based on their thermal velocity. If we keep expanding the sun, there comes a point where the outer hydrogen becomes incredibly loosely bound. At red-giant size, say, 1 AU in radius or 215 current solar radii, the gravity is some 46,000 times lower and the hydrogen on the surface only experiences 0.006 m/s^2 gravitational acceleration, but those same hydrogen molecules at red giant temperature (some 3,000 degrees K), are moving about 5.5 km/s. They can fly away from the surface for over a million km based on their thermal energy alone, compared to about 100 km at the surface of the sun currently (based on just under 8 km/s). In both cases, the outer layer of hydrogen and helium are in equilibrium, it's just that the gravity and red-giant size is so so so much lower that with the red-giant, equilibrium is this very loosely bound very disburse hot gas. But that's only part of the reason. Consider what else happens as the sun grows older. 

You're correct. While the 2 body system can (mathematically) remain perfectly circular, ignoring tides, gravitational lumpiness, etc, the minute you add a 3rd body, whether the sun or something much smaller, the perfect circle is no longer possible because the 3rd body stretches it. It creates a gravitational tug on the other 2 bodies. 3 gravitational body mathematics gets enormously complicated. See 3 body problem, so I won't get into that. What you've assumed wrong is in thinking that the Sun or 3rd body makes the Moon's orbit elliptical. The circular orbit is already elliptical because a circle is an ellipse, just one with an eccentricity of zero. When you add the 3rd body, it's gravity bends the shape into a kind of egg shape. It doesn't turn the circle into an ellipse, it turns the circle into an egg or it turns the ellipse into an elliptical egg or bent or stretched ellipse. 

Source. While I would be hesitant to try to prove this mathematically, the figure 8 orbit reminds me of balancing a pencil on it's tip. Slight variations tend to grow over time and it destabilizes quickly. (cool video on Pencil-balancing) 

I think dpwilson's answer is excellent and I voted him up, but I wanted to post this chart with the old picture is worth a thousand words point of view. 

Having given this some thought, it's a bit of a monster question with a few variables that you don't mention. Planetary tilt, which causes seasons is one. Length of day, for example, a rotation like Venus' 116 days would be quite different than an earth rotation of 24 hours and a tidally locked planet would also be different. Atmospheric pressure is another. I'm assuming Earth like tilt, 24 hour day since you didn't mention, and 1 ATM, but I think, if and when we finally get a good look at earth-like exo-planets, which, granted, might be several decades away, I think we'll see a few unexpected things. OK, moving on. Earth likely got much of it's atmosphere from comets which suggests healthy amounts of CO2, CH4 and NH3, maybe N2, some from the NO family, maybe some Helium, Argon and Neon, those 3 I think we can mostly ignore, some hydrogen perhaps from solar flares, which might get stripped along with the helium from the planet over time. The total amount of comet and asteroid impacts and ratio of gasses add some variability and a really important factor is whether or not the planet has life and undergoes photosynthesis. Photosynthesis would put O2 into the atmosphere and reduce CO2 and would also have the effect of, over time, reacting with and eliminating the virtually all of the CH4 from the air and any dissolved Iron in the oceans, turning the oceans from a muddy brownish/red to clear blue. Photosynthesis likely played a key role in turning the Earth from a hot planet to a snowball. So, lots of variables, but it's a fun speculative question, so I'll give it a shot. How much smaller than Earth? I'm going to go with Venus size but if you have different in mind, let me know. .815 Earth masses, 6,052 km in Radius and gravity of .905 of Earth. Source. 10 miles deep oceans (16.09 km), surface area, 4 Pi R^2 about 7.4 billion cubic km of water. (Earth, by comparison, about 1.37 billion cubic km) Source. Your planet has about 5.4 times as much water as earth (not counting water in the crust, but you didn't mention that, so lets not go there) - and planet size doesn't affect the predictions much. 

If the new moon is measured by moonrise then it's possible that it could land on a different day in different longitudes. Or, if it's not measured by day, but by astronomical position, it's still possible that it would fall on a different day in different timezones. 180 degrees of longitude should equal roughly a 50% chance of landing on one day before or after (2 days apart isn't possible). 30 degrees of longitude should be roughly 1 chance in 12 of landing on a different day. More detail is in the possible duplicate question. Map of timezones. While the lines aren't precisely straight, each line should correspond to about 15 degrees longitude. 

This is hard to say. Aristarchus of Samos ideas were less popular than Aristotle's (who came a little earlier) and Aristarchus' theories weren't central to Ptolomy's model which became the model for over 1000 years. I've often wondered what might have been different if Aristotle and Aristarchus could have exchanged ideas. Aristotle might have learned something and re-written his model, but Aristarchus was born too late. Ptolomy, who's model was accepted by the Roman Catholic Church, didn't pay much attention to sizes and, in fact, his model doesn't account for size well at all. It's one of the ways that his model breaks down, but his basic model had the Moon closer to the Earth than the Sun, so presumably he recognized that the Sun was larger than the Moon and it's not unreasonable to guess that Ptolomy might have said the planets are smaller than the moon. The stars, however, were for the most part, not addressed. 

Source of picture. That's why meteor showers have radiants and they happen at the same time every year. That's where the Earth intersects the orbiting dust trail from the comet. In the case of meteor showers, any part of the Earth where the radiant is visible in the sky can get meteors. The spread is significantly larger than the diameter of the Earth (but still a generally narrow band around the sun). In the case of shoemaker levy, with the breakup happening only one orbit prior to impact, the spread was quite small, and, relative to Jupiter's plane or orbit, the shoemaker-levy objects all hit Jupiter in about the same place, but over a period of about a week, in which time Jupiter was able to make multiple rotations. Jupiter has almost no axial tilt (3 degrees) so those impacts occurred nearly along a latitude line of Jupiter (3 degrees off). That's a result of hitting in nearly the same place as the planet rotated below the impact. In the case of Shoemaker-levy, where the fragments hit in single file over time, the impact site is on a plane perpendicular to the planet's rotation. 

Source You're right that there is a clear difference between Earth's surface where liquid water can exist, evaporate, make clouds, rain and repeat. Earth's water cycle in theory, could go on indefinitely so long as Earth's atmosphere and the solar input are maintained (and lost hydrogen is replaced), but it's, a circular system that only needs solar input. Jupiter is different because over time, the heavier gases in Jupiter probably will sink deeper towards the center and Jupiter's cloud forming gases should decrease given enough time. Some of Jupiter's "rain" probably does fall too deep in it's swirling mix of gases, and leaves Jupiter's cloud cycle permanently, similar to water seeping underground and leaving Earth's water-cloud cycle. So, in a 100 billion or a trillion years or so, Jupiter could lose it's clouds and cloud forming gases in it's upper atmosphere for the reasons you suspect. The reason this hasn't happened yet is simply mixing. While density of gas tends towards layers of increasing density, the internal heat inside Jupiter also wants to even out, so there's enormous convection going on pretty much all the way through the planet. This keeps some heavier gases in Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Jupiter's much too turbulent to have just hydrogen and helium in it's upper atmosphere. So, once we begin with the observation that Jupiter's upper atmosphere is (about) 90% hydrogen, 9% helium, 1% other gases and the mixing maintains the 1% of other, after that it's just cloud physics. Clouds look like puffy collections of water vapor (tiny droplets of ice or water, as water vapor is actually transparent). They look like objects with shapes, but that's not entirely accurate. If you are close to a cloud up close (flying in a plane for example), the clear edges disappear. A cloud isn't an object so much, it's a visible phase change. Atmosphere on Earth is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon and (usually not listed cause it's so variable), about 0.4% water vapor on average, as high as 1% with high temperature and high humidity and close to 0% in cold temperatures or dry-deserts. When you take warm surface air that's 0.6-0.8% water vapor, and that air rises (as hot air does), it's the phase change that creates the clouds. The cloud forms in the hot rising air as it cools. There's some electrostatic attraction, but mostly it's just a block of similar air undergoing cooling and the cloud looks like it has solid edges, but it doesn't. The same exact thing happens on Jupiter, different gases phase change at different temperatures/pressures, but the process is the same. And, just as on Earth, once the droplets or "icelets" form, they are denser and they begin to fall, but falling droplets are very small so they fall very slowly and for the most part, they are failing through rising atmosphere. Also, as they are a phase change, new cloud is being formed and old cloud is being disbursed or returned to gas all the time, kind of like sea ice. The clouds have the appearance of semi-permanence, but clouds are dynamic. If my explanation doesn't work for you, here's an explanation on clouds and how they really aren't bound together even though they look that way. But that's the gist of it, mixing keeps the upper atmosphere of Jupiter from being pure hydrogen and helium (or pure hydrogen), and after that, the cloud formation is pretty much the same as on Earth, just without a surface. Some of the heavier gases probably do get lost from the cycle, but the loss is slow enough that Jupiter still has some heavy clouds forming gases in it's upper atmosphere and will for probably billions of years to come. The greater density variation between H/He and other gases likely plays a role in how the clouds behave, as the density variation is greater, but the wind speeds are also higher on Jupiter. All that's really needed is mixing. After that, with gases that can become liquid or ice under temperature/pressure variations, the phase changes create the clouds. It's also possible that Jupiter's cloud forming gases, from time to time, are replenished by asteroid and comet impacts. Shoemaker levy 9 was about 5 km in diameter and a fair percentage of that was probably ammonia and water ice. That's a lot of cloud forming gas added to Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Jupiter's faint ring system, which might have been much larger millions of years ago, but since rained onto Jupiter, and Eruptions from Io might also play roles in keeping Jupiter's upper atmosphere rich enough in cloud making elements like water and ammonia.
