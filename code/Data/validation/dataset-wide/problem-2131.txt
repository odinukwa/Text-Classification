Asking about pay at this company is usually considered a faux-pas, how can I ask for a wage increase, and make an effective case? I don't think it's fair to be put under so much pressure to develop this stuff when I'm not even considered a developer and am getting the pay of a floor supervisor with much more responsibilities, stress, and skill requirements. I don't expect to meet avg. junior developer wages here, but having the ability to not constantly worry about my financial stability on top of my work stress would be nice. 

The management where I work almost completely turned over 1.5 months ago. My new boss (let's call him John) came in, and I walked him through our tools, processes, and reports. I also provided with with a documentation sheet that covers every tool, report, and data dump we have and how they are used. Fast forward a week, John pushes for a new process that directly conflicts with an existing tool, process, and report (all documented and previously described). Reinventing the wheel, and in such a way that it's less productive than it was before. Myself and several other affected brought this up and our concerns were discarded for the reason that he knows what he is doing. The next week, the same thing happens again, except on a much larger scale. Breaking several working tools and processes, increasing the time it takes to record, view, and retrieve certain information on the floor by nearly ten fold. We approached him again, received the same response, that he knows what he is doing, that he has done this before and it works. I was later confronted by him, asking why I am going off and making these things without permission. Why I am creating conflicting tools or processes. I explained that these have existed for almost a year now, and have been constantly evolving to be as efficient as possible. John asked for documentation that I was told to create these tools and processes, documentation that they were needed. I could not provide this as my previous (4) bosses essentially gave me the reigns to go about process improvement as needed. I was transferred to a new boss (Let's call her Jane) a couple weeks ago, a new hire that is to be the Director of Client Analytics. The best way to describe my experience is that I was put on a leash. Any time I would mention an idea, provide input or feedback to a process, or spend some time learning something new to increase my productivity I was met with what equates to a tug on my leash. Told that I need to not worry about that, that I just need to focus on the task at hand (there is no work to do right now, I'm browsing stackoverflow all day), that I need to take things one step at a time and not worry about the big picture. I was recently told by Jane, that she was informed that I go off and create things without guidance, permission, or planning, and without analyzing the need of the tool or process. That I am not focused on what needs to be done. The thing is though, I have not created a single tool, process, or report since any of the new management started. I have just been maintaining what we have. Previously, I was given free reign to do what needed to be done to improve productivity and meet the business needs, which I did, and completely automated. 

I like user13618's approach very much. How you handle this has in part to do with your level of seniority in the company. If you haven't been there that long, and/or if you are relatively new in your career, I can understand why you feel uncomfortable with some of the confrontation recommendations above. If you have a strong HR department that follow protocol, you could write up a written document about the chain of events that have occurred and your discomfort with them (i.e., your boss telling lies about you). This may trigger HR to hold a meeting to include you and your current boss, but this puts you on the offensive instead of the defensive. Bullies back down when you stand up for yourself, and this way you'd have the situation documented. Get a lot of visibility. Think like a politician and start making the rounds down the halls more often over the next few weeks. Go into the offices of your future colleagues and introduce yourself. Ask a few to lunch. Make the effort to get to know some of the reasons why they like about the work they do in their department. Build rapport. With your current boss, kill him with kindness if you elect not to do the HR route. If he's admitting to you or implying that he's said these things about you, smile and just say, 

I work as a Data Analyst for my current company and have been tasked with a lot of development work as of late. Most recent was a request for me to build a dynamic QA web app for the entire company (Call Centers, 1700 employees, ~65 clients). The requirements are: 

Good to note: This company has very low average wages, and is in the U.S. TL:DR: New project that I'm being put under a lot of pressure to do. I'm asked to perform full-stack developer duties as a low-paid data analyst. I feel abused at my current benefit level with the stress I'm under. It's not acceptable to ask about wage increases at this company, I need a way to effectively negotiate for a merit increase. 

To start, I work as a Data Analyst/Web Developer in a callcenter. I sit in the corner of the building, on the call center floor. Company culture and policy describes a very lax dress code, where wearing casual and comfortable clothes is actively encouraged over more formal wear. My superiors and coworkers often wear street clothes to work, a few of them regularly wear shorts as the building can get a bit hot sometimes due to a lack of thermostat control. My new boss, a lady late in her career, who has been very motivational and helpful. Told our new team that she expects us to properly present ourselves. Which means no casual clothing, we need to wear pants and a collared shirt. The reason is that we will periodically be in meetings with company executives and other high-level leadership, that she expects her team to stand out and be presentable. During this meeting, I said that I would be more than willing to wear business casual clothing when in the executive offices or when attending scheduled meetings with executives. But that I get hot easily in the company buildings, and would much rather work while comfortable than not. She effectively shot me down and the meeting ended. Today, we had a 1x1, and she said that she considered my comment on her clothing policy insubordination, that I was being selfish, and need to stop thinking about just my own wants. Along with how I'm being selfish to ask for a double-wide desk because I can't fit my work equipment on the 2.5ft wide cubicle I currently am at... I was unable to eloquently describe why I don't want to wear business casual clothing while sitting in a back corner programming all day, she was very effective at turning what I was saying back around at me. In the end I almost felt like a petulant child with how I was being treated. 

Then you can go on LinkedIn and look up their profile and get a feel for their past career - don't send them an invite before the interview). You should ALWAYS know who you're meeting with in advance. SALARY Don't afraid to ask this question to the recruiter or person who set up the interview: 

I have clients that have a daycare on site for their employees. Maybe it's time to start looking for a company like that. 

Interview Questions that you should ask your recruiter or person at the company that set the interview: 

Did you ask them on the phone what position you're being interviewed? If no, call them back and ask as well as for an agenda of the interview (how many people, their names and titles, what role they play with respect to the position you're interviewing for, what would they like you to come prepared to talk about). Normally a recruiter is prepping you and giving you all of this information, but if it's a small company and an untrained recruiter, that would explain why you didn't get this information. Adding to the above, if you speak with them before the interview (you should), ask them (them meaning whoever set the interview up), what in particular impressed them enough to want to bring you in? If you went through an external recruiter (one that does not work at the company, but is hired outside of the company to find candidates), make sure he/she can assure you that they understood the requirements of the position. I have seen time and time again rookie recruiters send candidates on interviews for positions that were a complete mismatch. Not fun. If it's the in house recruiter at the company, go ahead and ask them the same question.
