Not if the enemy can get around your wall. At this point in the battle, the Romans had very little maneuverability: they could push forward or to the sides or they could try to run out the back. The Carthaginians, on the other hand, had all the maneuverability: Hannibal could reorganize any forces not actively fighting Romans at his leisure, which is why he placed the cavalry behind the Romans to cut off their retreat. 

While the total encirclement might be the most impressive thing about Cannae, remember that it's just a special case of a pincer movement where the pincer goes all the way around the enemy. A pincer is itself just a special case of a flanking manuever in which both flanks are attacked simultaneously. The most important thing about Cannae was that Hannibal was able to flank the Romans; being able to then cut off their retreat thanks to his cavalry quickly driving off the Romans was just the cherry on the top. Flanking maneuvers were devastating to ancient (and modern) military forces. As you argue, it sounds like a flanked force should be able to reorganize itself, set up a shield wall or otherwise split itself up to take on an enemy attack from two sides. However, human beings can't fight effectively in two directions at once, and the goal of flanking is to force at least one soldier to do this, defeat them, and then move on to the next one. Flanking could also be extremely demoralizing: as long as your enemy was in front of you and allies to your sides, you knew that a path to retreat was open. If enemies began appearing on your side, it may only be a matter of time before they cut you off from retreat entirely. Being flanked was a major worry for ancient militaries, especially after it became clear that this was a major vulnerability for military units that were designed to move forward, such as a phalanx. Military formations were subsequently designed specifically to avoid flanks, such as by placing the strongest troops in the flank positions. To address the other points you raised: 

I believe they were in a half circle, not a full circle -- which means that the Roman line ended somewhere, which is where they could be flanked. If you look closely at the image you linked, you can see that most of the soldiers are depicted lined up fighting the Carthaginians -- the flanking is being carried out solely by the African Infantry and the Spanish and Gaulish cavalry, who are maneuvering past the Roman lines and attacking them from behind. 

Actually, I think they are literally saying that the Romans couldn't move their arms: I've always imagined the African infantry as pushing inwards into the core of Roman soldiers, causing the Romans to push inwards and back away from the Carthaginians and into other Romans. I can imagine that this would lead to severe overcrowding, where even non-panicking soldiers who knew where they should go and what they should do, couldn't, even as their compatriots died around them. 

Ideally, you'd like to shout "attack!" before the enemy army even knows you're there: an ambush. These are hard to pull off, but clearly happen without any negotiations, e.g. Hannibal at Lake Trasimene or the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. If there was no chance of hiding your forces from your enemies, your armies would maneuver around each other, trying to force battle at a tactically strong location. Some famous examples of such maneuverings include Pompey and Caesar in Greece and Hannibal and Fabius during the 2nd Punic War. If you could figure out where the opposing army was, you could send emissaries to negotiate, but both armies would be trying to hide their movements. An example of this type of communication is the delivery of Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal's head to Hannibal's camp by the Romans as a sign of his death. In this case, yes, generals could and would negotiate as long as it met the orders they were operating under. Once the armies met, the chance to hide was over: they would get into formation, with each side trying to get into a position that benefited them while costing the other side. Given that the armies would then march at or charge each other, their lines had to be pretty close -- which also meant that it was possible for generals to send emissaries to negotiate their way out of the battle -- since any battle held the possibility of a rout, any general would like to win by peaceful means of at all possible, but might not have been authorized to: few generals would be able to negotiate a peaceful solution if their leader had decreed merciless war, say. I think the examples you give in your question are good examples, but I don't think negotiated settlements would have been very common, as both generals would have had specific military goals to accomplish (capture some land, eliminate some army) and would know that they'd be unlikely to get these by negotiation. So, while this was definitely possible, it was probably not generally attempted. A good example of the closeness of the armies was at the Battle of Pharsalus, where Caesar's legions advanced to within throwing distance of Pompey's, paused to regroup, and only then charged. So, yes, even at this late state, negotiation was an option. It seems unlikely to me, though: negotiating might show weakness to the enemy or to your own soldiers, and you might be accused of cowardice. To respond to the other part of your question: the dwarves and elves had been allied not so many centuries ago and did not have perfectly contradictory goals here: the elves were looking for a monetary reward, and the dwarves could easily have paid them and both sides would have left peacefully. If the dwarves wanted to, say, eject the elves from Mirkwood, I don't think they'd've bothered to negotiate. 

As far as I know, legions weren't required to disarm or disband when returning to Rome, which makes sense: you didn't want the army to be unable to defend the capital if the Gauls or rival generals attacked the capital. The rule relating to Caesar crossing the Rubicon was that Caesar had been granted proconsular authority only over Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum (and later over Transalpine Gaul as well). This meant that he had no "power of command" (imperium) outside of those provinces -- it would have been just as illegal for him to lead an army into Spain or Greece as it would to lead it into Italy. Technically, he lost imperium when he crossed the border, i.e. his soldiers were under no obligation to follow him over the border and he had no authority over them. However, Legio XIII Gemina (like just about every legion Caesar commanded) were fiercely loyal to him, and continued following his orders even though it was against the law. To clarify: my understanding is that the law didn't say that legions were automatically disbanded when they crossed into Italy, but that it was illegal for a general with imperium to lead the army somewhere where he didn't have imperium. So who could lead an army in Italy? Anyone given that authority by the senate. This was generally the consuls, the highest elected officials in Rome. When Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, these were Gaius Claudius Marcellus Maior and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus. With Caesar's approach, however, effective control was given to Pompey, who was already under orders from the senate to raise 130,000 soldiers to defend Rome from Caesar. Note that these soldiers were in Italy at the time, armed and ready to fight -- so clearly leading an army in Italy wasn't itself illegal! Pompey opted to retreat to Greece with the soldiers under his command, where his allies could provide troops and supplies to him and his army. The rest, of course, is history. I couldn't find a lot of information on the no-armies-in-Italy rule, so hopefully someone else will contribute some here. There was definitely a no-armies-in-(central)-Rome prohibition, based on the Pomerium. This law was important enough that most of Sulla's commanders refused to violate it in 88-87 BC. Incidentally, all of this is based on pre-Imperial Roman history -- in 28 BC, the Caesar Augustus was granted imperium over every single province, so he (and all future emperors) outranked every general, magistrate, governor, proconsul or consul anywhere in the empire. To answer the rest of your question, I don't think Roman legions were often deliberately disbanded: there's records of legions mobilized over several hundred years, which I assume means that soldiers would be honorably discharged after serving for a standard 25 year term -- and, if they weren't Roman citizens, be granted citizenship for their service. I know there are some records of legions being disbanded, either because they could no longer be trusted, such as Legio IV Macedonica (in which case a "new" legion with the same number was immediately raied) or after a particularly brutal loss, such as Legio XVII, which was lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest and whose number would never be re-raised. but I don't think Roman legions would be uniformly disbanded at a particular place or time.
