Disclaimer: My Answer is based off Canada's Tour de Bloc structure. My understanding for the use of the term Open is that it is "Open" to anyone who wants to give it a go. If you are not vying for a spot on the Canadian team you would go Recreational or Experienced. The Open category is for the top climbers who are serious about competing. Open competitors vie for points based on their ranking at each comp, and the total points over the entire season determines the selection of Canada’s national climbing team. At each comp the open competitors first do a Qualifying round; the top 6-8 men and women then advance to a final round where they face 4 or 5 new problems that they have not seen before (called “isolation format”). The finals are always an exciting spectacle for all the other climbers to watch. 

Use the Overbag when it's too warm for your down bag Use the down bag at and around -15C Use the Overbag and Down Bag together when it's colder than -15C 

I too recommend newspaper however you can also give the following a try: Buy a pack of disposable diapers and empty the sodium polyacrylate into a sock or any fine mesh cloth/bag. Carry it in your pack for any absorption emergency. You should make sure to pack it in a sealed waterproof bag until you need it. Otherwise it will suck the humidity from its surrounding while you carry it! Sodium Polyacrylate is a polymer capable of absorbing 200-300 times it's weight in water. 

Basically it boils down to "less weight for the same insulation" in favour of the mummy type for two reasons: In a blanket type bag you have more or less two insulating sheets, one on top and one below your body. For a mummy type maybe a bit more than the area of one of those sheets would be enough to wrap your whole body. This already reduces weight and pack size. Above that, a mummy type bag wraps your body quite closely, therefore leaving only a small air volume that has to be warmed up. The blanket type has way more "dead volume" that you have to heat and keep warm with your body's heat. To get the same insulation, a blanket bag needs more loft material, which makes it heavier and bulkier. Another feature of mummies is a yoke or heat collar and a hood. The yoke closes around your neck and prevents warm air from escaping from the bag and both, the yoke and the hood can be closed by drawstrings, so that everything but the face is snuggly enclosed by the bag. A blanket type bag can in contrary not be closed densely at its open end, which allows the warm air to escape quite easily. All those factors might be not of great importance in warm climates where you don't need high insulation but only something to cover your body at night. As you get to climates where the sleeping bag is necessary to prevent hypothermia, a blanket type bag that provides the insulation needed will soon be way to heavy and bulky. Just as a side note: if you go to very cold climates (winter mountaineering, arctic tours), everything is done to prevent heat loss, therefore some of the bags designed for those climates have only a half length zipper or even no zipper at all to prevent cold bridges. The major drawback of the mummy bag is its tightness. Rather "active" sleepers that move a lot during the night or like to take other sleeping positions than just lying straight (legs spread, fetal curl or similar) might feel a bit less cramped in a blanket type bag. But some manufacturers also have mummy bags that have a more flexible and expansible material in the middle part to allow for leg movement to some extent. TL;DR: Whenever it gets cold enough that insulation is a critical factor, a mummy has less weight and pack size for the same insulation. 

It is used to store the sleeping bag, in order to retain the loft. It is not a good idea to store your sleeping bag compressed as small as possible as this will damage the fill. This is very important with down, a little less with synthetic but overall it is crucial to the life of the sleeping bag. A couple things to remember are you want to ensure the bag is dry before storage and it will be stored in a dry area free of excess condensation. You also want to randomly toss it about in the larger storage bag as opposed to rolling it then storing. Rolling up your new sleeping bag will create creases in the same spot over and over and your bag will develop cold spots where the insulation separates as a result of these creases. The most ideal storage is fully laid out and hung, however manufacturers provide a breathable bag of what they have deemed is an adequate size to store the sleeping bag in. 

EDIT: When the question was posed I misinterpreted it to be asking the diameter of the "Climbing Rope" not "Cord" However my answer for Cord diameter is also listed as "2mm less than cord diameter and not less than 5mm" I would not go any lower than 7.5mm*, it is a common diameter used by rescue technicians.There are several reasons why I recommend 7.5mm, listed below. 

To take a quite extreme example, we consider the following situation: you want to travel by ship from the southernmost tip of South America (Tierra del Fuego) to New Zealand. For whatever reason, you don't intend to approach New Zealand in a direct course but plan to keep basically parallel to the Antarctic coast line (i.e. on an east-west course following a certain latitude) and do a sharp rectangular turn towards the north once you're in the gap between Antarctica and New Zealand. Your only measure of direction is your compass and since you are on the ocean, there are no land marks to correct your course on the way. According to Wikipedia the magnetic south pole (which is of course also off from the geographic one) is currently somewhere at the Antarctic coast right opposite of Australia, i.e. shifted towards Australia with respect to the geographic south pole. So if you start in Tierra del Fuego at the southern end of South America and head straight east according to your uncorrected compass, you will in fact travel slightly northwards on the globe. This northwards tendency will increase the closer you get towards New Zealand (and hence the magnetic pole) and – it's just en estimate here, I would have to run the numbers for the exact outcome – in best case you would just hit New Zealand without the intended northward turn in the end while in the worst case, you could miss New Zealand by its northern side and end up in Australia or South East Asia instead. 

*According to numbers a 6mm static cord can hold 1600 lbs however I would not recommend using it for the purpose of ascending, let's keep it for hoisting the bear barrels into the trees. If you attempt to ascend a rope using only friction knots please use a safety back up such as the system detailed below! As a safety precaution tie off the slack end of the rope, using a figure eight on a bite, at progressive intervals and clip to your harness. To avoid having a clutter of these knots all hanging off your harness you might choose to untie and release each previous one. Note, however, some climbers prefer the clutter to potentially getting the trailing rope snagged far below. 

As your body gets used to the altitude, the symptoms go away. Therefore, if symptoms persist, Yes you should be worried. Altitude sickness can affect your lungs and brain. When this happens, symptoms include being confused, not being able to walk straight (ataxia), feeling faint, and having blue or gray lips or fingernails. When you breathe, you may hear a sound like a paper bag being crumpled. These symptoms mean the condition is severe. It may be deadly. 

If you own a mid-layer wear it to the store when you purchase the shell. If you own a shell wear it to the store when you purchase your mid-layer. If you don't own either purchase them together to ensure best fit. 

Sharing and downloading routes done by others Concerning sites where you can upload and share GPS tracks you could have a look at $URL$ There are lots of GPS tracks for hiking, cycling, mountain biking, running, skating, horse riding,... you name it. The extended search allow to filter routes for the things you ask for, e.g. 

For central Europe I can recommend www.wanderreitkarte.de, which is a German site but has also an English and Italian language layer. Its data is based on openstreetmap data which is (at least in Germany) much more detailed off the beaten track than google maps is. Unfortunately it does not contain Norway, where your hike has obviously been done. Nonetheless, I will reference it here as it might help other visitors to that site who are within the covered area. The tool has some nice core features, with the most appealing (for me) being able to mark some points along a desired route and make the tool figure out a route through those points along certain characteristics. The characteristics can be divided into horse riding vs. hiking and then into generate a preferably flat route, allow some ups and downs or include even via ferratas. The generated route can be downloaded in .gpx format and it's also possible to get an elevation profile. 

None of the information you give about your planned use case sets any limitation to a standard dynamical sports climbing rope. Also you won't notice small differences in the specs especially as it is your first rope to buy. Those different specs will only make a difference as you bring a rope to its limits. For example with routes where you have huge bolt distances and can expect high fall factors, a lower impact force will be nice, but in a typical sports climbing case this won't matter. So you can just go and get the one that is cheapest or you feel most comfortable with or that has the nicest color or whatever criterion you want to choose. For the dry option: this will only be of relevance if you plan to use the rope for glacier hiking and/or ice climbing where it is more or less sure the the rope will get wet. But in this case you will usually get a rope on its own as normal sports climbing useage would quickly destroy the dry coating. Therefore investing money in a dry coating that you (according to the information you gave) quite surely won't use will only make the salesman happy. 

Is it safe to throw them in the dryer on low heat? If actually used for paddling out in the woods how would you dry them? 

I have never re-soled a pair myself however one day I would like to give it a try just for fun. If you really want to give it a try why not, but remember to take your time and don't get frustrated! However, if you're hoping to have a shoe that's like new with a perfect edge and don't own any other pairs I would send this pair off to the professioanl and try next time... 

The chemical coating on the outside when new is what is commonly known as DWR and chemically known as a Fluoropolymer. Fluoropolymer is a fluorocarbon based polymer with multiple strong carbon–fluorine bonds. It is characterized by a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. This is the same chemical treatment used on all water resistant fabrics. Gore-Tex uses this coating to prevent the outer layer of fabric from becoming saturated with water. This saturation, called 'wetting out,' can reduce the garment's breathability (moisture transport through the breathable membrane) and let water through. As the DWR wears off over time, re-treatment is recommended when necessary. 

The bottom line is there is always SOME risk. Whether to take that risk or not is your choice. Fast running + isolated + high elevation = prettttty low risk. With that said the biggest concern is, unless you are drinking right from the source, you have no idea what has happened upstream from you. There could be a dead animal snagged in the stream, animal and human feces etc... I have drank from mountain streams and not gotten sick, but I have seen others partake and get real sick...The choice is yours. 

Which treatment for which use case? Concerning the question which rope to use for which activity: I would say for 90% of climbing activities you are fine with a non-dry one and a rope with dry treatment is just wasted money since the treatment will wear down as you se the rope. So as long as you use your rope for activities where you don't expect to have it exposed to water or snow for prolonged times, a non-dry rope is enough. This covers basically indoor and outdoor sports climbing since normally you are only performing those activities in fairly good weather and even if some unexpected rain shows up it's no problem to rappel down one pitch on a rope that got a bit wet from the rain. For multi-pitch rock climbing, it is somewhat debatable if a dry coated one is just nice to have or essential. It depends a bit on what type of climbing you are doing there. If you are just doing some multi-pitches in a developed climbing area where you just rappel down some pitches, get to your car and rush home if it starts to rain, you won't need a dry rope. You can do all this also on a wet rope – the handling will be a bit uncomfortable but it works. If you are climbing in some alpine area where there is a chance that you have to rappel some ten pitches in a heavy rain storm on a soaking wet rope with cold water running down the rope as the rappel device squeezes it out of the rope and the whole rappel taking twice as long since friction has increased dramatically and then you have to hike out another one or two hours while carrying your soaking wet rope that is more than twice as heavy as in dry condition, you will condemn yourself that you wanted to safe those bucks on a dry coating. If you plan to climb on the last few pitches to the top instead, you should make sure you have a rope with dry coating, since a not coated one might break under a lead fall (source). Where a dry coating is quite inevitable is everything where it is clear a priori that the rope will come in contact with water and/or snow, i.e. ice climbing and glacier hiking. In short Rappelling on a wet rope is ugly but still OK – having a lead fall into a wet or even damp rope may be critical. So whenever there's a chance that you will have to climb on (and not just rappel down to go home) even after your rope has been in contact with water, you should invest the additional money for a dry coating. On the other hand, it's wasted money for the most widespread cases (sports climbing) where you just stop as it starts to rain.
