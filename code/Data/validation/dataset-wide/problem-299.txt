No. If you need to do anything, it would be easier to do it via a Matrix like virtual world or a remote telepresence. Technology is already gearing itself to reduce the need for physical travel. 

You might be able to prevent yourself from dying of natural causes but there will come a point where you no longer want to live. Boredom and repetitiveness will eventually drain your will to live. Humanity will eventually become extinct due to a lack of breeding because sexbots will stop humans from forming relationships with other humans. AI will inherit the Earth......... 

The only reason people would abandon technology is if they were incompatible. In The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, the hero is a wizard living in Chicago. He lives in a basement without a fridge and most technology because magic causes technology to fail and the more advanced the more likely magic will cause it to fail. He can get away with old tech such as a revolver most of the time but machine guns or semi automatic weapons jam. He drives on old VW Beetle because modern electronic system in anything built in the last thirty years is likely to die from exposure to his presence. Even so even the Beetle dies regularly. Now if a nation went magical, technology would fail for everyone living there. Now to take it to next step, a magical nation could use magic to wipe out the technology of any nation they chose. Smart guided missiles are useless with no electronics. Even planes would avoid flying over magical nations. Soldiers with simple guns would lose against wizards that can make shields and throw fireballs. A magical nation could rend itself invulnerable to modern military forces and have the ability to push a technological country back into the dark ages. 

As naive I can be, I always assumed people started inventing flying machines in order to "be like the birds". In an earth-like world without any flying/gliding being (animal or plant), what could be the drive for people to glimpse the idea of flying? Assume this is about a "Leonardo da Vinci" inventor, who is planning to create a machine to "go into the sky". What kind of simple observations and thoughts would be sufficient to at least spark this idea? Provided that gravity teaches that "what flies goes back on earth in no time", is it enough? 

What about a particular kind of cancer? I'm not a doctor, but it is my understanding that some kinds of cancer happen due to DNA damage. What would happen if the two nations had a problem on vast scale of people having these kinds of illnesses? I think they might try procedures to repair the DNA, and since identical twins have the same DNA, they could lead their trials on twins. Of course, if the phaenomenon is widespread, the governments would have to "use" all the twins possible (since they are rare)... 

The most obvious is when there is no communication AKA jamming or radio silence. The other advantage is they more resistant to hacking. The pilot is right there which means they can operate during radio silence and can't be jammed. Other than that, there is no real advantage. Drones still have human pilots that see through the same sort of sensors. 

The initial problem is staying alive long enough to change society. Assuming you don't get enslaved or burnt as a witch, any basic high school science knowledge could change the world. Gun powder is 75% saltpeter, 15% carbon and 10% sulfur. With just what I know, I could get society started on gun powder. The steam boiler and the piston was invented by the ancient Greeks. If they had put the two together, we would have had the steam engine 2000 years earlier. Sickness is caused by germs and can be stopped by hygiene. Medical tools should be sterilized by boiling. Alcohol can be used to sterilize wounds. A battery is made of two different metal plates and an acid and so on. I'm no scientist but even I could change early society. 

It's not a safe place. The bosses are secretly studying a way to upload themselves into the machines, and while for religious matters the protagonist won't create an army of himselves, the bosses would. Each boss is provided with a save point in order to study it, with the order to upload himself/herself/itself only if he/she/it has 100% chance to succeed. Bosses, though, are not overconfident, and that's why they put an entire dungeon to protect that point, and why they didn't try that yet. 

I can actually think of many ways for them to "enjoy" wars, but in the long term, since they are immortal, they'd learn that wars achieve nothing. Let me explain: if they know they are all immortal, they will probably focus on a guerrilla with ambushes and imprisonment rather than anything else. Maybe kidnapping and maybe sabotage (but hey, even if they are greedy, they can anyway live without crops, right?). So after a couple generations the war will reach a standstill, where factions simply don't go in some territories (fear of being taken by the other faction and spend the eternity inside a volcano?). Eventually their arrogance and ignorance (they are human-like, right?) will make some people think that they could instead reign, so I would focus more on "secret" civil wars, kidnappings and tortures rather than a proper war. 

Forget your technology or what you plan to do. Your problem is what to do with paradoxes, the whole "What happens if I go back in time and kill my father" There are really two main ways for time travel to not make paradoxes. You have fixed time where you can go back in time but you cannot change time. You try and kill your father but the gun jams, you miss, time machine fails, something happens to prevent you from changing time. The movie 12 Monkeys is like this. The other option is the multiverse theory where traveling back in time spawns off a new reality so you can kill your father or at least the version of your father in this new universe. Since it's not really your father (from your timeline), no paradoxes are created. Once you work out how your time travel works, how you apply it is up to you. 

I'd say the demons exist underground. They can pop up anywhere but to really fight them you need to enter the tunnels and then air power means nothing. It's a bit like the Vietcong who had whole cities underground to avoid bombing. 

but I'd believe normal people wouldn't want to call themselves like semi-gods, nor would they dare to call themselves "the ones who know [insert divinity name here]". TWIST: The "Moirai" could also actually be their enemy, since they'd no more shape human destiny. 

A lot of people believe that a chip cannot be tampered with from a distance. This is not true, especially if you are setting your story in a future where technology has evolved. Assuming your ID must be wirelessly communicated, I assume that the informations (whatever they are) stored in the RFID-like chip are encrypted. The problem with traditional cryptography, though, is that if you have the key(s), you have everything you need to decrypt your code... And the keys are too stored somewhere. Quantum cryptography is said to be impossible to hack due to the fact that a "bit" of information alters its state when it's read (from third parties). Problem is: it alters its state when it's read by a machine too... and if a machine is expecting a certain sequence to launch the missiles, it means that there's too a key involved... Assuming the worst case, terrorists have the key(s). A wireless transmission of a code is really a bad idea, since what the terrorists would do is simply set a smart-antenna to track the chip from a distance, and read its informations. What's indeed difficult is actually to get to the president physically. So why bother with a chip, when a retinal scan (some users already pointed out that this is impossible to hack - and why can't the scan work with sunglasses? They can be "smart" ones, or the scanner can be), voice recognition, fingerprint analysis, password and a titanium bullet with a code inside hidden in the body are all things that need a physical abduction? In short: I wouldn't rely on a (single) code stored on a (single) chip. Especially if transmission is considered. 

Foreword: I'm aware of the limitations of the square-cube law involved in sizing an animal up, as these limitations have been relentlessly stressed in every discussion of realistic fantasy creatures. In this case, I'm discussing not an animal, but a slime mold with animal-like motility. Slimes Slimes in fantasy video games are all rather similar to each other in appearance and behavior. They are macroscopic and generally sphere or droplet-shaped, and capable of moving under their own power, often elastically bouncing meters into the air. They absorb solid matter directly through their gelatinous surface, and it's often implied, stated or demonstrated that this is how they eat. Though they are extremophiles found in every biome (e.g. forest, tundra, island, volcanic mountain, swamp), they are fairly weak creatures, and they can be dispatched with the first sword you get. I want to construct a more realistic slime. I've looked for the largest slime molds that exist in the real world and have identified Brefeldia maxima as a potential candidate for improvement. It's a single cell approximately a meter across, and it can weigh 20 kilograms. It's not spherical, though - it's a layer about a centimeter thick. Nevertheless, its size is interesting. The traits I am looking for are: 

I have to disagree with the other answers. Just imagine this as a car. Yes you can install a massive supercharged motor but such as motor would start to rip the car to pieces. You need to reinforce the body to handle the power. You need stronger brakes, better gearbox perhaps an improved electrical system. All of this would help in an accident. Sure the motor might mean a much bigger accident but in a regular accident it has to help. Super strength would require the strengthening of the whole body. Bones would be denser or have a different stronger structure to prevent them from breaking under extreme loads. Muscles and tendons also need to be stronger to prevent them from tearing. Perhaps the body incorporates a bio form of carbon nano tubes to prevent tearing. Skin also needs to be strengthened so it doesn't tear off. Super strength doesn't work if your palms rip off while trying to lift a bus. All of this would increase resistance to bullets. You can't re-enforce everything without increasing resistance to damage. It's a mini verses a truck thing. 

Am I the only one here thinking about bioengineering trees so that their wood becomes more weapon-ready? I'm talking about super venomous resins, super elastic / super sturdy materials, exploding wood, or whatever you can think of. 

What about "Thanatógon(s)" and "Biógon(s)"? Those come from death = Thánatos (θάνατος) / life = Bíos (βίος) + the word "puppetteer", which is translated into "Góns" (γόης). I strongly disagree with people using "Nekros" as "Death", since it actually means "Dead" (a person who is deceased). The divinities they devote to could indeed be the "Moirai": 

Make it biological. A tons of stuff that lives like cells and so on cannot (yet) be seen, scanned or whatsoever. Microscope stuff that you see is often dead and artificially-colored in order to let people actually see it. This would also have the advantage that you could have a very fast-expiring mix (when cells inside are dead, it works no more). 

As I pointed out in some comments, let belief do the trick. Your question pretty much implies that creature C has to provide A & B in both their universes a tangible/perceivable proof (which sounds to me a lot like scientific method), but since the dimensions are orthogonal, each inhabitant of these planes would not have the possibility to glimpse the existance of "the others". Let C be a creature A e B look up to (God?) in both worlds. Through belief of C's words, A could believe in B and vice versa. Let me write an example: suppose my terrestrial life and the hell are orthogonal. Through religion I believe in the existence of hell, therefore I don't commit crimes or such in order to preserve my soul in the afterlife. By acting like I do, I am altering what happens/will happen in hell (I am wildly assuming that hell has no time). The two dimensions are entwined, but I never had the possibility to experience any proof about it being real. 

Your knight would be better off with leather armor. It's still resistant to biting and scratching but it's a fraction of the weight and a lot quieter. He'd be better of trying to sneak around the zombies. He will die of exhaustion if nothing else trying to cut down 125K zombies while walking 50 miles. He still needs to eat, sleep. 

The cult is family based. Children are brought slowly into the cult and external partners the same way. The cult has multiple levels or circles and only the most devout make it to the top tier with the actual blood sacrifices. Any members without the correct mindset are left on the lower tiers and don't actually know the extent of the cult. Should a lower member find out the extent and be appalled and try and expose it, they have a tragic accident such as brakes failing or slipping off a ladder. Should the cult have members in the police force and government, the investigation into said deaths could be a bit lax.
