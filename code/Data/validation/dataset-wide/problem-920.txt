So when a huntsman stumbles over something, he blames his hounds. But how does that explain that "since 33% of the officers died in the attack, this was a sign that the army was to be victorious"? These two observations seem unrelated to me. Am I missing something? 

What is the meaning of this phrase? "The monsoon remains at the same low intensity for some months"? Why is the word *still** italicized? 

What is the meaning of from crowns to kicks? From the top of your head to the tips of your toes? Or "ranging from a crown (say, made of gold) to a pocket or wallet full of money"? The Merriam-Webster dictionary provided me with the "pocket, wallet" meaning for kick. I never knew about this meaning of "kick". 

What is the meaning of the line in bold? What is the first cause and what is the second cause? How can a cause know another cause? 

What is the meaning of made them fit for heaven? Why would a cuckolded husband be "fit for heaven"? (According to the plot, "his majesty" is a sultan who has been cuckolded by one of his wives: she ordered Don Juan bought on the slave market and brought to her in female disguise) 

Was Hardy here exposing his own anti-Semitic prejudices here, or was he merely commenting on the general sentiment in England at the time relating to Judaism? 

So: Did he actually die? Is he hearing the heart beating for real, or is this his crazy, guilty, conscience? 

He appears to be using it in a sarcastic manner. He is saying that they are so stupid, that he'll call them geniuses. It's like when someone says: "Washington DC is the capital of the United States?" "Yes, you genius!" You don't mean that they are actually super smart. In this case, 

When Sophie is taking her religion studies test, she writes this: (page 124 in my edition; chapter "Hellenism") 

It doesn't appear to be symbolic at all; a dog barking at a crow is merely an annoying sound that she would rather listen to. Crows are notorious for teasing other animals. I mean... look at this! In the above linked video, the crow is hanging around behind a dog, who's tied up, and repeatedly going and pecking the dog with it's beak and dashing away. It just keeps bothering the dog. Presumably the dog is barking at the crow, but the crow doesn't leave. Beatrice is taking an example of an annoying sound, and saying that she would rather listen to that then the man's declaration of love. She's giving a very clear message - I don't love you. 

In general "vessel" can mean a ship or boat, or a container for liquids. I suppose your quotation takes it in the latter sense. 

describing the scuttlebutt that Gareth heard in the scullery. Here "the Prophet" is Merlin. And elsewhere in the Idylls: 

This is not an exact answer to the original question. TROTAM was first published in Bristol in 1798 in a collection by Coleridge and Wordsworth, Lyrical Ballads. As one might expect, the very first edition is rare, and subsequent editions numerous. The earliest version I have found on-line is of a 1798 London edition. It titles the poem as ""THE RIME OF THE ANCYENT MARINERE,/ IN SEVEN PARTS." The parts are labelled simply "I." , "II.", on up through "VII.", (without the word part) each starting on a fresh page, with fancy rules above and below the numbers. 

It is clear from web pages such as this one and this one that (unlike "sonnet" or "limerick" or "tanka") the term "grook" or "gruk" is not a widely used term for a recognizable verse form but rather a word invented by Piet Hein for the poems he wrote. It is possible someone other than Hein has written grooks, but the Internet does not seem to know about them. Hein, with his starkly elegant design work (see this for a suprising instance), seems to have become a Danish culture hero. But I do not think his poetry is much imitated. 

What is the meaning of this all in plain English - especially the part in bold? My attempts at deciphering this: 

I've reread the stanza many times but I cannot get a grip on its meaning. Once I think I understand some particular phrase, the general meaning starts to crawl apart because it fails to dovetail with other phrases. 

Just to make sure: is the meaning here "only her husband thinks that she is not a whore, but all the rest know that she is"? 

I first thought that "Ignorance had palisadoed cohorns there, just like you may see in forts of Netherlands". But why is there the possessive s after "cohorn"? Okay.. let's try to assume that "Cohorn's ignorance" is subject in this clause. This "ignorance" had "palisadoed" something - but what exactly? And "palisades not higher than grass blades"? What is he talking about? I can't wrap my mind around this, and thus I fail to understand these three lines. What do they mean, in plain English? 

What is the meaning of this line? "Settled wind" is a wind that has settled, isn't it? If it has settled, how can any waves roll ahead of it? 

Now, I may be interpreting this incorrectly, but in my experience a 'gown' is usually a type of dress, with the exception of a 'dressing-gown', which is more like a bathrobe. This could be incorrect, as I'm a modern American and the book is rather old and British. More telling is this quote: 

...but I don't see anything about the 'many countries' that the Wikipedia page claims that it was banned in. Is this Wikipedia page accurate, that it was banned in many countries? Which countries has it been banned in? 

There's obviously something down there; that's the whole point of the story. However, is this at the bottom of every mine if you dig deep enough or only at the Pahpocket? 

On some books, I've noticed that they have colors on the edges of the pages. For instance, on my Tikkun: 

The oath didn't mean anything, but it made him more keen anyway. The way I'm understanding it, it's saying that it won't be kept. As Rand said, I'm not explaining why it won't be kept, because I'd need to actually have the book with me ;). But from what you quoted, it appears that the text - whoever the narrator is - is saying that the oath won't be kept. Perhaps it wasn't a strong enough oath; perhaps the person making it doesn't have the power to carry it out. But whoever the narrator is doesn't think that the oath will carry any weight. But, despite this, it makes whoever it was directed to more confident in what they are doing. 

What is the meaning of the phrase in bold? "Such days, brief but delightful, had not staid long, thanks to her (tragic) destiny"? 

What is the meaning of this? I looked up the meanings of Irish in Wiktionary, but remained a bit puzzled. The ear becomes "more filled with anger/passion"? What is "less nice"? Maybe the ear is clipped by the bullet, and becomes malformed? 

What is the meaning of this phrase in plain English? What are "boards" here? Sides of the ship? Both sides of the ship were trying to get away from water? I can't understand this. 

She had a symmetrical face ("regulated charms of feature")? Hm.. Or, to the contrary, her face and body were not symmetrical? Painters fail to reflect such "asymmetrical charms" in their paintings? In comparison, they fail to reflect "faces that sin against proportion". Painters "hit off" = "describe in few characteristic strokes of a brush" - in the beginning of their work upon a portrait. What does "that strike" refer to? The strokes left on the canvas by the painters "strike" the viewers as very interesting/beautiful? The phrase "still are like" leaves me completely baffled. Such strokes on the canvas, reflecting the irregular but characteristic features, are all alike, no matter who is being painted? 

It occurs to me that both might be true, and "hedgehog" is also meant as a diminutive form of "boar", in a contemptuous, put-downy kind of way. In zoology, of course, a hedgehog is not a kind of pig, but its name, the OED says (p188, vol 5, 1st edition) analyzes into "hedge" + "hog", the first because of this animal's habitat, the second because of its pig-like snout. So in a word-play sense, a hedgehog is a pig, but a small pig. A boar is a big pig (using big and small in their surface meanings of reference to size, and not moral quality), and this is the sense in which I'm suggesting "hedgehog" might be used as a diminutive in Anne's speech. Rhetorically, of course, to say something is small can be to belittle it, to put it down; similarly with a thing's symbol. According to this suggestion Anne might be saying Richard (that is, the man whose symbol or badge is a boar) has a pig-like snout, but might also be saying he is of small moral stature. By popular demand: here is another source for the fact that the boar was Richard's badge. As with the previous evidence, it was chosen because it was easy to find. Unlike the previous one, this is associated with a national museum: it describes an artifact (a boar badge) with a "Treasure number" (whatever that is), T359. And another: Brewer's Dictionary of phrase and fable (1970 "Centenary Edition", p.129) has an entry (in its entirety) 

Why does O-san have a 'vacant look on her face, as though she had been roughly wakened from some peculiarly delicious dream'? What does this imply? 

The book opens with the main character, Jimmy Carter, playing baseball - this could be what you're remembering as scouting. The cover does have the main character on it, wearing dark glasses. The book was published in 1994, so it's within the time frame. I don't know enough about it to say for sure, but it appears to match your description, from what I can tell. 

But while looking up the term "creative nonfiction", I found this definition, on CreativeNonfiction.org: 

What they are saying here, is that this character is making the other people do his work for him - and that these people are doing the same thing, pushing their work onto other people. (FWIW, they are commonly referred to as help vampires across the Stack Exchange network.) Since Tom Sawyer tricked the other people into doing the work that he was supposed to do, they are comparing these people to him. 

One possible way to read this passage is that Charles does not pay much attention to news from home, no more than he pays to the nattering chatter of other passengers on the train in America. Some people think Americans are especially given to striking up unwanted conversations with strangers on the train; in some cultures this can be regarded as a form of rudeness, an invasion of solitude and hence of privacy. Such facts about themselves as they offer ("my uncle Orley -- he came from Altoona -- was very fond of chili sauce, and said it was healthy, but he died of cancer at age 43", say) slip out of Charles's consciousness, and leave no mark on his mind. In short: in this passage, "fellow traveller" means "a traveller sharing location with me for a period of time", not "Communist sympathizer". 

But the contrast is not between abstract and useful knowledge, but between elaborate and simple literary styles. 

Here "Boar of Cornwall" is Arthur. So Layamon and Tennyson posit a different CV for Arthur than Malory does: childhood with the elves in Avalon, rather than with Sir Ector. Green uses elements of both.
