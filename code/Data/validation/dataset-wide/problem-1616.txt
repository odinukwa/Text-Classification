Residential refrigerator efficiency is a very well studied field because of the impact these appliances have on overall energy consumption, but I have not found any evidence of a specific study on this strategy. However, some reputable organisations do support the claim. According to the Consumer Energy Center of the California Energy Commission: 

The recommendation comes from "Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, And The Prevention Of Cancer: A Global Perspective": 

A known disposable razor company is claiming on their web site that their current product is superior to their old one because it has 5 blades instead of three. You can see the claim on the "science" page here, watching the "Why Fusion is better than MACH3" videoclip. Do five blades provide any proven advantage in comparison to three blades? For example, less cutting, or a deeper shave? The company only claims it's better, however I don't trust them, as they show only pseudo-scientific crap instead of real facts on their site. Does any science back their claims? See also The Economist: 

Unfortunately the EIA source seems to be really hard to find (404) and I can't verify their claim exactly, but given the other numbers, they are at least in the ballpark. 

Barks are one of the way in which dogs communicate. For example, some barks mean loneliness and can be methodically distinguished from other kinds. 

Alcoholic beverages have depressant effects, as the claim states. Ordinary, modern tequila is a normal liquor in this respect - I wouldn't expect any strange effect, besides some possible placebo.

The official site does not claim that he had the appearance of a recently deceased, in fact it was firstly "perspiring sweat & blood" and then it was merely "whole", however they claim magical lights and miraculous healings: 

Probably not, but I can't say this conclusively. It appeared without attribution on the internet in 1997 on an anti-veal-consumption web site [beware: gross images are displayed with the intent to disgust. The quote is in a 1997-style .

There are two types of precipitate that come out of hard water: those that form "scale" and those that form "sediment." Scale will cling all over stuff. Physical removal is almost always impossible, and you typically have to use chemicals to remove it. Sediment, on the other hand, is more loose, and if you were able to stick your hand in the water heater, you could scoop it out as if it were sand. You're supposed to drain the sediment out, but most homeowners don't, and even if you do, it's only marginally effective. 

Two out of every three United States corporations paid no federal income taxes from 1998 through 2005, according to a report released Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. ... In 2005, one in four large United States corporations paid no taxes on revenue of $1.1 trillion, compared with 66 percent in the overall pool. ... In 2004, a G.A.O. study said that 7 in 10 of all foreign corporations doing business in the United States, or foreign-controlled corporations, paid no taxes from 1996 through 2000, compared with 6 in 10 United States corporations. $URL$ The story also includes a quote from a fella from the Tax Foundation, an organization well-known to peddle corporate propaganda about taxes, about how the untaxed corporations are just simply the corporations that lost money, making no profit, and thus paying no taxes. Although such examples certainly do exist, the statement is false, as is most everything that you hear out of the Tax Foundation. In fact, a NYTimes author, in a blog post, linked a mash-up of articles rebuffing the Tax Foundation, and I found this in that mash-up: the actual tax rates paid by US corporations are extraordinarily low, around 6%. ... Remember the latest GAO report (reported elsewhere on ataxingmatter) that shows that two-thirds of US corporations pay no federal income tax. That's not just the ones that are losing money, but also many corporations that have record high profits (including some Big Oil companies) that end up paying next to nothing in taxes. ... As a result, the US is actually a corporate tax haven, with the lowest effective corporate tax rates of almost all the countries that participate in the OECD. That's a little fact that the Tax Foundation apparently doesn't want the American public to understand, since all its hype is in terms of statutory rates and not in terms of effective tax rates. $URL$ Just to give an example, one way to avoid paying corporate income tax is to provide goods & services, for pennies on the dollar, to a subsidiary operating in a foreign country that doesn't tax them. By doing so, you erase your domestic profits by sending it to a foreign subsidiary in the form of goods & services, which they then use to make even larger profits, which they then send back to you, untaxed.

Conclusion None of these studies is conclusive (the biggest study was on 27 patients). Given that in some cases, spermatozoa were found in pre-ejaculate fluid, the only conclusion we can reach, pending better studies, is that in some common cases it does indeed contain sperm. As such, it is not advisable to ever assume that coitus interruptus would be effective in preventing pregnancy.

—Why do veins appear blue? A new look at an old question, by Alwin Kienle, Lothar Lilge, I. Alex Vitkin, Michael S. Patterson, Brian C. Wilson, Raimund Hibst, and Rudolf Steiner In summary: there are other reasons why veins are blue (due to the color of the surrounding tissue), and blood is always different tints of red but never blue. 

It's impossible to prove or disprove the assertion that something is "typical", but there's much evidence that both effects occur (that science and tech benefit each other). There are many examples of science benefiting technology but the quintessetial example could be that a scientist, Sir Tim Barners-Lee invented the web while working on basic science at CERN. 

It is certainly possible to "harvest" power via induction from high voltage power lines. There is a vertical voltage drop from the wires to the ground. This effect can power stuff. For an example of this, see this (awesome) picture of a neon being lit by proximity to the power lines. source Also, this energy leakage is openly admitted by power lines companies, for example:

Caveat: Thermal energy from the sun heats buildings passively. Conclusion No as answer The graphs compare apples to oranges. Primary wind power should get a factor of 2-4, solar power a factor of 5-8 and hydro should also get some factor (but this is more difficult to figure out). I'm not sure how they calculated biomass, so I won't go into that. The graphs are representing primary energy according to an outdated definition, as renewables are wrongfully represented by their secondary energy. I see no indication in their report that they addressed the issue of defining primary energy with regards to renewables. Yes as answer The definition of primary energy is taken according to 3. By this definition the graph is correct.

Supporting claims based on primary and secondary energy definitions (NO as answer) Primary energy (1,3) is the energy contained in a fuel. So to speak the released heat in perfect combustion. Unburnt fuel is part of many energy conversion cycles. It is not the generated useful energy. Non-Fuel based primary energy would be the input to the system, not the generated useful energy. For wind turbines this would be the energy contained in the wind, a perfect wind turbine can only get around 60% of the winds energy (Betz's law). For solar we have around 15-20% conversion efficiency. Therefore the primary energy of renewables is many times higher than the listed numbers. Secondary energy (1,3) is the energy of energy carriers, these are for example fuels and electricity. Fuel can be an input for electricity generation, so even there are subclasses regarding the quality of the secondary energy. (Oil would be primary, gasoline a secondary energy in some regards, even though we don't use all of the energy in gasoline either) Exaggerated alternative data (just to make a point) Primary solar energy heats the earth during the whole year, if we assume that heating needs(relative to the avg temperature of space of a few Kelvin) are met by solar power, we get about 99.9+% (didn't calculate it actually) of the primary energy in solar. Counterargument (YES as answer) A claim arguing that the definition of primary energy is usually as probably envisioned by the authors of the Energy Report, from Ref 3: 

The important point to note here is that some mutations will be necessarily correlated with having more offspring, some other will be necessarily correlated with having less. This is called natural selection. 

$URL$ For more information, the wikipedia page on the Hockney-Falco thesis does a good job of describing the controversy. 

$URL$ He referst to this article which was written by authors in an undisclosed conflict of interest, they are funded by anti-vaccination propaganda groups. In any case, the article has been thoroughly debunked, and, if you think of it, it also contradicts the claim of Mihailovic. Mihalovic claims that some vaccines, when used together, are toxic/deadly: a bit like two-part glue, if you like. The authors of the debunked article claim that the number of shots is relevant -- which is ludicrous, of course -- and that they found a linear relationship between the number of shots taken (they call them "vaccines", but it's not what they are) and infant mortality. There's also another link that claims that vaccines cause type I diabetes, but that seems off-topic with respect to the original claim. Unsurprisingly, it's also written by a person which holds patents on "methods of testing vaccines for their ability to cause diabetes and methods of preventing diabetes", in other words, who has an open interest in making such claims. TL:DR; Vaccines are safe. Lack of vaccination is irresponsible and causes harm to children and immunocompromised groups.

There is no proof that this is the case While I found extensive citations that this legend exists (e.g. Wikipedia calls it a myth), it is clearly not possible to prove a negative. The Wikipedia article cites a book which I cannot check myself: Koch, Ebba. (2006) The Complete Taj Mahal: and the Riverfront Gardens of Agra. Thames & Hudson The official web site of the Taj Mahal has a fairly complete historical section and a legends section. In the historical section, it mentions the names of the actual workers without mentioning that their hands were supposedly cut off.
