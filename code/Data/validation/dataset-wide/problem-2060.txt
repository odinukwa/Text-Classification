Note that for this to work in the long run, these points do need to be true if you mention them. For instance: If you end up getting only 80% of the work done that others do after you made the second promise, you can expect to get kicked out sooner rather than later. (Assuming your labor laws are not too protective). 

If you choose 3, there are mainly just 2 relevant outcomes Outcomes a. You will be doing something that you feel good about (all other thigns are not really relevant, assuming that your feeling also takes account what will happen in the future) -> Problem solved b. You will be doing something that you don't feel good about -> Now you can go with option 1 (quitting) or option 2 (waiting) or even option 3 again (escalating) 

Quick should be less than 2 minutes, or less than 15 minutes There are 2 situations that I am often in, depending on this the definition of quick is set. If in doubt, go for the shorter one. Also check out my recommendation to mitigate the problem all together. Situation 1. Infrequent contact You have comparatively infrequent contact, and especially almost never ask trivial questions. If the other guy sees you coming, and, he knows that either you have something that is going to take a while or it is not too bad, then quick becomes 'it does not really mess up my daily schedule'. Hence an ESTIMATED time of 15 minutes (if it starts to grow as you go and projected time is raised above 30 mins, evaluate whether you want to continue or plan something instead). Situation 2. Frequent contact/ Other If you have more frequent contact, your question distribution is likely not centered around questions that take more than an hour. In that case, anything over 2 minutes can significantly disrupt the task that they are currently doing and hence 2 minutes is quick. (If you have too many 'little things' that is a different problem on which I will not elaborate here.) If you do not have a working history together or the circumstances are different than usual, just stay safe and assume that quick means less than 2 minutes ESTIMATED time. Resolution If your question is quick, simply respond with something like this: 

Knowledge transfer (e.g. Code to enhance productivity) Junk (e.g. Anaconda repository) Private (e.g. Copy of your passport and other HR things, Love letters, Private pictures...) 

Disclaimer: This answer assumes that there are no requests made of the employee that he could not reasonably expect when he signed up for the job, without this context my answer would probably be too harsh. If asking is not working out, consider telling him instead. Telling people to do their job is quite a normal practice in many companies. Though do read the end of this answer for possible consequences. If you him to do something, you basically give him a choice and force him to make it, perhaps in a way that is uncomfortable for everyone. If you have a situation where it can be expected that an employee has to work day 1 and 3 in his home town, and day 2 somewhere that is too far to reach by bike, don't ask whether he wants to work on day 2. Just tell him that you have 3 days of work that need to be done, and that you expect him to get things done properly. Based on the conversation examples you provided he will probably say something like 'how do you expect me to cycle X miles between workdays?', at which point I would recommend you NOT to discuss that topic at all, but just apologize and say that you need to make sure the companies work gets done. Considerations I already mentioned that this answer assumes that the employee could reasonably expect the requests that he is now getting. However, think about the following: 

I am a bit surprised that this has not come up in any of the answers, but the easiest solution seems to be: Use an alias Aliases are not that uncommon, in my country people with christian names often use an alias, as well as people from a different nationality. And then there is still a decent group of people who use it because they just don't like their given name, or don't want to be confused with someone else. Note that this answer is geared towards a given name only, changing the family name would be unusual. Advantages This has nearly all advantages of an official name change, without the drawback of it being published/costing money. I you would inform your references that you did a name change, you can also inform them that you are now called differently. Disadvantages At some point you will need to submit your formal name, for instance when you are going to sign/when they need to do background checks on you. At this point you will of course provide them with your formal name, and if any questions are raised you will answer them, but hopefully it leads to minimal distraction in the complete hiring process. 

Ask for an apology The feasibility of this of course depends on the circumstances, but strange as it may sound, the only way to make the working situation less toxic is if you display strength and state that you expect an apology. Perhaps the person who accused you was just in a (really) bad mood at the moment because the task did not get completed, and though this is no excuse to start threatening his underlings, it did happen and you may consider to forgive him for that. 

Other kinds of solutions exist, that might help here and which I did not see yet in the other answers (though 2 is mentioned in a comment): 1. Accepting the task, and indicating he will have it tomorrow morning. Though perhaps it may be common for you to pick up things right away, it is not mentioned that the task really has to happen now. Something like this could simply be enough: 

Note that if his common response is to push you to do it today, you may need to play with the wording untill he does not have the urge. An example: 

As you can already see from the replies here you will get into a swamp if you try to extrapolate behaviour from a strange encounter to his general personality, so I would absolutely stay away from those kinds of discussions. If you have to say something more specific because feedback must be defendable, just use one of the standard lines that applies here, like 'Not a good fit with the team'. 

Bottom line is: regardless of what happened 2 years ago, if the situation stays such that everyone feels that you may need to apologize then it will only keep getting worse for you. In that case it is indeed best to start packing as the existing answers suggest. 

The existing answers already point out that this can happen in for-profit businesses as well. However I will share my experience on how this could be dealt with in a reasonable way. This is something that I have seen in practice everywhere that I have worked: Give people a discretionary budget By giving people some leeway for small expenses, you avoid wasting time and decision effort on trivial spendings. In addition you can speed up the decision process, and give people the feeling that they are trusted to (know how to) act in the best interest of the company. Examples 

Focus on alternate means of communication If he really cannot talk properly, he can steer towards alternatives. For example: When someone calls, don't pick up but either use a voicemail message or directly send a text message like so: 

Focus on the root cause Rather than saying Yes, or No, which both put you in a horrible position try to shift their focus. When asked questions like this I usually choose one of the following answers, depending on what I think their root cause is: 

Note on moment of reveil Note that at some point early on before/after they hire you your name will come up. Whether you submit it, they ask you, or you tell it later during lunch. At this time it is critical to keep calm, and not encriminate yourself. Try answering in the line of: 

That way you do get the point across that your reason is purely financial, but may reduce the (potentially undesirable) impact on your own image. Note that this response does invite people to challenge your response. So consider in advance what arguments you want to use, and think of how far you want to go in a discussion. Note that the fact that you make this statement (and the arguments that you use to support it) will likely impact your image in a way as well. 

Keep it straight and simple If you tell lies here they may come out and hurt you badly. As such I would recommend you to stick to the truth, but leave out the details. It can be as simple as this: 

There may be indirect benefits On one hand I would not expect those in charge of your promotion to look at the shares you have when deciding on a promotion. On the other hand: 

Agree on timeboxes and stick to them The most basic version of this is: I will work at most X hours per week or per day. If the hours run out, and the work hasn't, then you stop. Of course X can be variable depending on the situation (e.g. you may increase it around a go-live) but it should always be something acceptable. A more detailed version would be: I work at most X hours per week on task A, and will work the remaining hours on task B. Typically you will be able to agree on strategic priorities (like A and B need to be done this year), but when there are a lot of milestones in A, and B only gets checked at the end of the year... then typically only timeboxing can prevent you from fully getting drawn into A. Practical tip: To avoid the timeboxes to be silently reduced, choose fixed (half) days which you block for A or B. You can of course leave some flexibility. Manage expectations with these timeboxes in mind Once these timeboxes are set, you know your capacity. The next day someone will likely come and as you to do some work on A. At this moment you should say based on your timebox, with the current workload I will work on it by T. From this point all kind of things can happen, (and it will be most easy to defend your timeboxes if two equally powerfull managers are responsible for each timebox), but at least now the long term work will not silently slide back on the planning. The manager can of course choose to re-prioritize and tell you to work on A, but at this point you must make him say explicitly that he is telling you to work on A instead of B which was planned.
