With so few males, they would be in high demand. The death of a male could provoke wars with other nations or black-ops-style kidnapping attempts of males from other societies. A male could find himself promoted from an abused stud slave to a king (albeit probably a figurehead in such an extreme case), or demoted in like manner depending on the fortunes of war, covert operations or diplomacy. While a male might be afforded the same rights as a woman, when it comes to biological necessity and international politics, they could find that they really don't have any more rights than those the women choose to give them. There could also be biological implications. Assuming that we're talking about humans, we could find the baculum re-appearing within a number of generations, as having a penis bone would be a distinct advantage for a male who would be in such high demand. While the duration of intercourse would not be longer as is generally the case with species in which a baculum occurs, the necessity for these males to spend a lot of time copulating effectively sequentially would select for the presence of a baculum. Another likely biological adaptation to higher levels of paternity would be higher testicular and prostate mass. In societies where men - or semen - were available to all women who wanted to have a child, we can expect the level of female attractiveness to decrease somewhat, as a woman's attractiveness to a man would cease to be a factor in reproductive success. However, in a society where the males have a choice of partners, female attractiveness would be more important - and selected for - than ever. A male would be well-advised to stay away from the homely women - they're likely the ones who practise sexual slavery. 

The Dr Watson AI must reduce insurance payouts and the company's running costs. This goal can indeed be assisted by providing advice to the insured, however there are additional measures that can be implemented in order to achieve this: 

Assuming that E.T. is an evolved being and not a poorly bioengineered survey drone or just the cutesy anthropomorphic invention of Hollywood filmmakers that it actually is... Environment Given E.T.'s feet and legs, it is apparent that this is a ground-dwelling non-cursorial being. Given that in the movie, E.T. does not display any superhuman strength or subhuman weakness, we can assume that its home world has gravity similar to our own. The fact that E.T. and its technologically advanced crewmates appear to be voluntarily exposing themselves to our atmosphere indicates that there are atmospheric similarities between Earth and E.T.'s world, most probably having a similar pressure and composition. There are most likely differences in the partial pressures of the various gases, but falling within the acceptable range for at least limited unprotected exposure for E.T.'s species. There exists the possibility that given that this species appears to go about naked, that it has some sort of internal technological breathing apparatus. Given E.T.'s short legs (especially when compared to the very long arms), we can assume that this is not an arborial species (since the toes are not long enough to be opposable given the size of the foot pad), and that it has no predators that need to be outrun, nor prey that needs to be pursued. Since its fingers are of unequal lengths, it is unlikely that it does much in the way of brachiation, again making it non-arborial. Diet Given that it has binocular vision, this, combined with its small mouth and long arms, indicates that it most likely eats small items of soft food that occur mixed with non-food items, for which visual discrimination is important, and can be readily picked by hand. This food may be sessile, or if motile, must be fairly small, like insects, capable of rapid acceleration but not high speeds over any long distance, hence the long arms that could grab a fleeing bug of some sort without requiring the whole creature to move much. Given the short legs, this food is likely available within reach, not significantly above head level (which is variable, given the extensible spinal-column analogue). The small mouth is suggestive that its food is not other large animals or plants that require significant effort to break up to an ingestible size. Given that we don't see dentition implies that this species has no enemies which might be deterred by a display of dentition. Otherwise, we cannot draw any conclusions about its dentition other than that no great number of teeth seem required to process its food, ruling out tough or fibrous foods that might require a lot of mastication to fit down the narrow neck. The luminescence displayed by these beings in their upper torsos and in their longest digit may be evolved, but in an advanced social and technological species (assuming that they built their own starships) which has demonstrated a facility with vocal communication, is more likely to be a side-effect of some technological devices that facilitate communication and environmental manipulation. Since it is unlikely that telekinesis could evolve where there are more efficient biological alternatives, the in-movie demonstration of telekinesis is most likely the result of some unobvious technological enhancement. Evolution While we can tell from this creature's body-plan that it has no enemies to outrun nor prey to pursue now, this does not exclude this from its species past. That its legs appear unaccountably elephantine, in contrast to its slender arms and neck, suggests that its species may in the past have had longer legs, and that they have evolved to be shorter, and that the folds of skin may have occurred as a result of a mismatch in the rate of evolution between bone length and skin tautness. That a species may have evolved to have shorter legs is suggestive that in its evolutionary past it did have a need for greater speed, but the species has long outlived such a need. The greatest probability is that this species has both eliminated potential predators from its environment, and has been producing constructed dwellings for a long period of time, leading to both a lack of advantage in long legs, and an advantage in short legs. This suggests a civilisation that may have lasted tens to hundreds of thousands of generations. The evolution of the extensible neck indicates that this species has not been particularly speedy for a very long portion of its evolutionary history, yet had a need to look at things on different levels fairly closely. This suggests a somewhat sloth-like metabolism, potentially as a response to low-nutritional-value food, which would tend to select for energy-saving traits. Society In the movies it is demonstrated that these are social beings, and it is generally accepted that sociability is a prerequisite for a technological society, such as one capable of building a starship. Given that one individual (who we should not presume is in any way greatly out of the ordinary for its species) is capable of audible communication, including with another species, it should be assumed that its primary form of communication was evolved to be audible, and that any 'telepathic' communication is a later technological add-on that has since superseded the audible communication channel. Also, given that these beings are slow and presumably patient and methodical and that given their physiology their society appears to have existed for a very long time, it can be reasoned that they have dealt with the issues of high energy consumption and the environmental degradation that a high-tech society tends to produce. This may of course have led to a global-city-world, with no non-domesticated species remaining outside preserves, if any still exist, hence their apparent interest in the natural environment of a presumably less-degraded world at the borders of a populated area. 

Another way to make this world plausible is to locate it in a binary star system. Put Nabirmo into orbit around a very dim red dwarf star near or even a little beyond the outer edge of its habitability zone. It would become tidally locked to the red dwarf, with its axis of rotation pointing toward the red dwarf, but if the red dwarf/Nabirmo system was itself in orbit around a larger, more luminous star, also near the outer edge of its habitable zone, we would get a situation where Nabirmo's non-constantly-illuminated hemisphere would receive just enough heat to prevent it from freezing entirely. If the orbital planes of the three bodies were closely aligned, the brighter star would be eclipsed by the red dwarf when Nabirmo passed behind its red dwarf star. One important factor is that while Nabirmo is tidally locked to a relatively distant dim red star, it is still rotating with its axis of rotation locked toward the red dwarf, so that when it is illuminated by the brighter star, it receives a day-night cycle over the surface facing that star while Nabirmo is to either side of the red dwarf in its orbit. When Nabirmo is between the red dwarf and the brighter star, both inwards and outwards faces would receive illumination over longer periods. When the brighter star is at the outer pole's zenith (the outer pole being the one facing away from the red dwarf), both hemispheres would be receiving constant illumination, which would be much dimmer at the equator, hence the equatorial ice ring. 

Presuming that you had a plant that could extract and concentrate a particular material, the answer is that it could happen at very low soil concentrations indeed, however in such a circumstance, the yield would be very low. A plant might concentrate material by absorbing water that contained dissolved material, or it might more actively release then reabsorb a solvent for that material. Once the material was in the plant, it would simply be a matter of transporting it to the site of expression and precipitating it out of solution. A plant which does this might produce nodules of the material in question, separate from its seeds. As to evolutionary advantage, if a plant evolved to do this and humans discovered it, its success would be assured, as humans would cultivate and protect it. There is relatively little other advantage to the plant except in the presence of humans, so this would be a symbiotic relationship. 

TL:DR: This is going to be very difficult, if not effectively impossible. At any rate, if the individual in question does not have at least a solid grounding in biology, and preferably at least a year of modern university-level microbiology, they are most likely to spend a lifetime re-creating the tools needed to even begin to search effectively for any effective antibiotic, let alone penicillin. Here are the problems: Growth Media Bacterial cultures don't generally grow on just anything. To get most strains or species to grow, you need a growth medium with basic nutrients added. I did Microbiology 101, which was enough to tell me what nutrient agar is, and how to prepare it (follow the instructions on the tin), but at that level it was only glossed over how to actually make it from scratch. Then, there are other types of agar, each designed to sustain fastidious bacteria with particular requirements or to assist in identification. You may well not even be able to grow some types of infectious bacteria without specific types of agar, let alone test them for antibiotic resistance. Then you have the problem of the moulds you are testing. They, too, will require suitable growth media, and for the most part nutrient agar will be suitable, though some valuable strains may be more fastidious, and may require special media. Equipment and Techniques The equipment used in microbiology labs is fairly basic for our society, but is not nearly so basic for a medieval society. Pretty much everything in a lab takes place around a Bunsen, Teclu or Meker burner, which is commonly used to sterilise things such as inoculation loops, which have wide application. Inoculation loops require wire that will not corrode, even at high temperatures. These burners wouldn't even have fuel readily available in the medieval period, and even a wealthy noble might baulk at being told that (very pricey) fine platinum wire is required. It takes a whole semester at Uni to train a student how to perform the gamut of basic microbiological techniques such as streaking (to isolate genetically pure strains of bacteria) without making mistakes that result in contamination. As one example, to streak an agar plate to isolate individual bacterial species from a basic liquid culture of mixed bacterial species, the microbiologist must: 

Okay, let's look at this: We have a yellow-white F8 star somewhat larger than our sun, with the planets orbiting at 1.6 AU. This is in the correct ballpark for the worlds to be in the habitable zone of such a star. However, please note the somewhat higher UV output of the star. A point to consider is that during the spring and autumn equinoxes, there could be repeated solar eclipses over the course of a number of local days - which, given the mass of the larger world as 7.1768*10^24kg (being 1.2 times that of Earth at 5.98×10^24kg) and the distance of 180,000km, would be 8d 0h 37m 5.59s. If I'm wrong, and the orbital separation is 90,000, the orbital period/day length would be 2d 20h 6m 2.97s. The latter would be more hospitable, though either way, there would be a large difference between day-time and night-time temperatures either way. Given the details given in $URL$ it would appear that a day length of 62h and an orbital separation of 90,000km is the correct figure. Using the stated planetary mass from that page and the larger world's geosynchronous orbital radius of 89,238km, we get an orbital period/day length of 2d 14h 6m 6.86s. This is around 6h different from the value obtained using the figures in the OP's question so please note the importance of exact figures. For the planets to be tidally locked at 180000km separation is also plausible, and even more so at 90,000km, given their mass. That their plane of common orbit is tilted 25° could be a problem - the sun 's gravity would be trying to pull this back into the plane of the ecliptic, but it isn't beyond the bounds of possibility. One point is made in the referenced thread, that: 

This may happen for reasons of pure human psychology, no magic required. Any soldier who experiences combat, and particularly close-quarters combat, let alone being an executioner, is likely to suffer from post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD). Humans are conditioned from birth to value the lives of other people in their society, and are predisposed by genetics to require the company of other humans, so the taking of human lives - even those of an enemy - is a traumatic experience. Even more traumatic is to witness the injury and death of comrades in arms or to be injured in battle. While some more militaristic societies may have means in place to minimise the incidences of PTSD - often taking the form of post-combat group discussions that have the effect of group therapy - it is inevitable that despite possessing any particularly exceptional combat skills, there may be individuals who are more affected by their military experiences. Additionally, being an executioner is also traumatic. While in some societies, those executed may have been found guilty by due process and the executioners insulated as far as possible from the act of taking the condemned's life, in other societies, particularly absolute monarchies or other autocracies, the monarch or autocrat may be more arbitrary as to the imposition of sentences of death, potentially ordering the execution of innocents for no reason other than opposing political views or even a whim or fit of pique. An executioner in this environment - who may also be required to take a more personal hand in performing the execution, such as decapitating or strangling the condemned in person - is more likely to suffer from PTSD, especially if required to conceal any disagreement with the sentence in order to maintain personal safety. It has been shown that more intelligent individuals suffer less from Ptsd, however, this may be due to the greater possibilities for an intelligent individual to find ways to minimise the effects. It is certainly possible that the OP's battle-hardened executioner may have been an intelligent individual who became affected by PTSD, and to compensate, took the personal choice to change their life from one of bringing death to one dedicated to saving lives, not only using accepted and known medical practises, but also by discovering new and better ways to save lives. Pursuing such a career could have the effect of allowing this individual to feel that he is atoning for the many deaths he has caused and to feel that his fellow countrymen need not die pointlessly if he can save them.
