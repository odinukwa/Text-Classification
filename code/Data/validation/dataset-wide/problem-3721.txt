I would like to explain why the answer to the question is negative in general, following the suggestion of Tom Godwillie (however see PS for a positive answer if $dimX<\infty$) Let us note first that there is an $S^1$-action on $\mathbb RP^2=M$ such that the quotient is a the segment. Now, apply the idea of Tom Goodwille. Namely take $\Gamma=\mathbb Z_2$, and consider the inclusion $\mathbb RP^2\to \mathbb RP^{\infty}=K(\mathbb Z_2,1)$ that induces an isomorphism on $\pi_1$. Clearly, this map is not contractible, so it gives a counterexample to the claim in the question. PS. However, using the remark of Misha it is also possible to prove that the answer to the question is positive in the case when the group $\pi=\Gamma=\pi_1(X)$ has no torsion elements. In particular, it holds when $X$ is finite-dimensional. Sketch proof. Denote $M/S^1$ by $Y$ and let $p$ be the projection map. I claim that the kernel of the homomorphism $\phi^M_Y:\pi_1(M)\to \pi_1(Y)$ induced by $p$ is generated by torsion elements. Since $\Gamma$ has no torsion elements, it follows that any homomorphism $\phi^M_X:\pi_1(M)\to \Gamma$ factors through a homomorphism $\phi^M_Y$, i.e. there exists $\phi^Y_X:\pi_1(Y)\to \pi_1(X)$ such that $$\phi^M_X=\phi^Y_X\circ\phi^M_Y.$$ Now, since $X$ is aspherical, the homomorphism $\phi^Y_X$ is induced by a map $\psi: Y\to X$. Finally note that the original map $\varphi: M\to X$ and the composed map $\psi\circ p$ are homotopic, since they induce the same homomorphism on $\pi_1(M)$. 

Let $X$ be a complex projective variety, $E$ be a rang $n$ bundle with $n<dim X$ and $s$ be a (holomorphic) section of $E$. There is a relatively straightforward criterium to check if the space $s=0$ is non-empty. Namely it is enough to know that $c_n(E)\ne 0$. Question. I would like to know how one could check that $s=0$ is connected. In the case that is of interest to me $X$ is a homogenious variety (i.e. it admits a transitive group action) and $E$ is an equivariant bundle. Maybe there is some kind of Lefshetz principle that says that $s=0$ is connected if $E$ is "sufficiently" positive? 

Recall that Kobayashi metric is defined on any complex manifold $M$. This is a pseudo-metric according to which a tangent vector $v$ at $P$ has length at most $1$ if there is holomorphic map from the open unit disk in $\mathbb C$ to the manifold that sends $0$ to $P$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ to $v$. $URL$ I would like to know if the following analogue of such pseudo-metric makes sense. Definition. Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold and let us say that $v$ has length at most $1$ (for the new pseudo-metric) if there is a conformal minimal immersion of the unite disk to $M$ that sends a unite vector at the centre of the disk to $v$. Question. Are there many examples for which this pseudo-metric does not vanish? Was such a definition studied by someone? Remark. Clearly in the case $M$ is a Riemann surface this construction gives us the usual Kobayashi metric (i.e it is trivial for $\mathbb C^1$, $\mathbb CP^1$, $T^2$, $\mathbb C^*$ and is a metric of constant negative curvature otherwise). 

I was reading chapter 6 in the book of Harris on Algebraic geometry and came to the following puzzle. It seems to me that every Schubert cell in a Grassmanian is obtaining by cutting the Grassmanian by a certain plane in its Plucker embedding (hope this is correct, I got this idea from Harris' book) Now, I was thinking always, that there is a whole theory of Littlwood Richardson coefficients that explains the intersection theory of Grassmanian and in particular explains what are intersection numbers of various cells. My question is as follows. Why do we have this complicated theory of Littlwood Richardson coefficients? (is this because Schubert cells don't always have expected dimension ?) Naively, if all Schubert cells were obtained by intersecting Grassmanian transversally by some planes the only number that would pop up would be the degree of Grassmanian in its Plucker embedding. 

It seems to me that the intersection is zero in general, i.e. the answer is YES. Let us prove that $f^{-1}(B)$ is a smooth curve in $X$. This clearly implies the desired result. The proof of smoothness of $f^{-1}(B)$ relies one the following definition and a lemma. Definition. Let $C$ be a complex curve in a complex surface $S$ and $x\in C$. Let us call the local fundamental group of $S\setminus C$ at $x$ to be $\pi_1(U_x\setminus (C\cap U_x))$ where $U_x$ is a sufficiently small neighborhood of $x$. I think that the following lemma is correct. Lemma. A complex analytic curve $C$ in $X$ is smooth at $x\in C$ iff the local fundamental group of $C$ at $x$ is $\mathbb Z$. If this lemma holds, then it is easy to see indeed that in your question the total perimage of $B$ is smooth, because for any point $x\in B$ and a sufficiently small neighborhood of $U$ of $x$ the map from $f^{-1}(U\setminus (U\cap C))$ to $U\setminus (U\cap C)$ is etale. I.e. all connected components of $f^{-1}(U\setminus (U\cap C))$ have $\pi=\mathbb Z$. Intuition for the lemma. I think that the lemma can be obtained as a corollary of Mumford's result stating that a point $x$ on a surface is smooth iff its link is the 3-sphere $S^3$. Here is why. Indeed, suppose that $\pi_1(U_x\setminus (C\cap U_x))=\mathbb Z$. This means that the intersection of $C$ with the boundary of $U_x$ is an unknot. Indeed, the only knot is $S^3$ whose complement has fundamental group $\mathbb Z$ is the unknot. Now, let us take a double cover of $U_x\setminus (C\cap U_x)$ and take its analytic completion. This is just a double cover of $U_x$ and its boundary is again $S^3$. So this double cover is smooth. Finally we see that $U_x$ is a smooth quotient of a ball by a smooth involution, hence its branching set (i.e., $C$) is a smooth curve. 

What is a simple way to prove that for any compact two-dimensional surface $S$ and an element $g$ in $\mathbb \pi_1(S)$ there exists a finite index normal subgroup $\Gamma\subset \pi_1(S)$ such that $g\notin \Gamma$? In fact, who was first to prove this statement? 

Let $\mathbb B^n$ be an open unit ball in $\mathbb R^n$ and let $F$ be a smooth function on it. Let $\frac{1}{2}\mathbb B^n\subset \mathbb B^n$ be an open ball or radius $\frac{1}{2}$. Let $\mathbb B^k$ be an open unit ball in $\mathbb R^k$, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathbb B^n\subset \mathbb B^n$ be an open ball or radius $\frac{1}{2}$. Question. Is it true that $F$ has a critical point in $\mathbb B^n$ if there exists a smooth surjective map $\varphi:\mathbb B^n\to \mathbb B^k$, that has the following property: 1) For any $y\in \frac{1}{2}\mathbb B^k $ the strict minimum $$\min_{x\in \varphi^{-1}(y)} F(x)$$ is attained in $\mathbb B^n$ at some point ${\bf x}\in \frac{1}{2}\mathbb B^n$. In particular, $\inf F$ on $(\varphi^{-1}(y)\cap (\mathbb B^n\setminus \frac{1}{2}\mathbb B^n))$ is smaller than $\min_{x\in \varphi^{-1}(y)} F(x)=F({\bf x})$ (if such an intersection is non-empty). 2) The point ${\bf y}\in \mathbb B_k$ where the maximum of $$\max_{y\in \mathbb B^k}\min_{x\in \varphi^{-1}(y)} F(x)$$ is attained lies in $\frac{1}{2}\mathbb B^k.$ Comment. This is a largely rewritten formulation. I hope that the answer is positive if the differential of $\varphi$ is surjective on the whole ball $\mathbb B^n$ I would be grateful for a reference (or a counter-example...). 

What are largest betti numbers $b_2$ and $b_3$ of three-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds that are discovered for today? Is there some nice reference? 

Let $X$ be a sub-variety of $\mathbb CP^n$ and let $p_X(k)$ be its Hilbert polynomial. It is well known that some basic invariants of $X$ (such as its dimension) can be read from $p_X(k)$. I am interested to know to which extent one can read connectedness of $X$ from $p_X(k)$. Here are two precise questions. ($n$ is fixed). Question 1. Is there a classification of polynomials, for which it is known that every subvariety in $\mathbb CP^n$ with given Hilbert polynomial is connected? If there is no such a classification, I would like at least to know a large list of such polynomials. Question 2. Suppose that $P$ is the Hilbert polynomial of a complete intersection on $\mathbb CP^n$ of positive dimension. Is it true that any subscheme of $\mathbb CP^n$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$ is connected? 

It looks indeed that this question is not as classical is it sounds, so let me provide a 2010 reference to a more general statement, at least to show that there is a reference. This is Proposition 3.2 in the following paper: $URL$ 

Let $M$ be an orientable $3$-manifold with connected boundary $\Sigma_g$, a surface of genus $g>0$. I would like to find a reference to the following two statements. 1) $\pi_1(M)\ne 0$. 2) $\pi_1(M)\ne \pi_1(\Sigma_g)$. 2)' If 2) is too hard I would be happy just to know that the map $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)\to M$ is not an isomorphism. I think I can prove the first statement by contradiction. If $\pi_1(M)$ were trivial it would stay so after gluing a handlebody to $\Sigma_g$. In the resulting simply-connected manifold one can chose loops inside $M$ that have non-zero linking number with loops inside the handlebody hence they are not null-homologous in $M$. Hence we get a contradiction with $\pi_1(M)=0$. But I don't see how to prove 2), and this might be hard. I would be grateful for some tips. 

Really sorry for this question, but googling for some time did not help me. I was trying to understand the meaning of the following phrase: Let B be an augmented algebra over a semi-simple algebra T. But I am stuck already with "augmented algebra"... -- can not find a definition on the web. 

It was proven by Batyrev in 1981 $URL$ that there exist exactly 18 smooth toric Fano three-folds. I would like to know if there is some place where the pictures of the corresponding 18 simple reflexive polytopes are presented. More precisely, I would like to see the moment polytopes, i.e. the polytopes that are dual to 18 reflexive polytopes depicted in the reference given below by David. These polytopes should be Delzant, i.e., each vertex can be send by an element of $SL(3,\mathbb Z)$ to the standard vertex given by equations $x_i\ge 0$. 

I am reading a wonderful article of Arnaud Beauville, called La théorie de Hodge et quelques applications $URL$ There is one place on page 12 that I can not understand. Beauville seem to claim the following: Claim. Denote by $K$ the field of meromorphic functions of the (complex) cubic $x_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3+x_4^3+x_5^3=0$. Then one can show that there exists an embedding $K\subset \mathbb C(y_1,y_2,y_3)$. Question. How to show this? I have to say, I doubt this statement (not anymore). Since the cubic is unirational, we have $K\subset \mathbb C(y_1,...,y_n)$ for some $n$. But it sounds strange that one can chose $n=3$. Is this a misprint or I miss something? (for a connection to Luroth problem see $URL$ PS. I guess Artie's comment explains that Beauville is 100% correct. So I would like to ask one more (non-trivial ?) question: Question 2 Is it known what is the minimal number $d$ such that there is a degree $d$ (dominant) morphism from a rational complex projective three-fold to the cubic? 

I hope this question is not unreasonable. We all know how to take products of numbers, this generalises to a huge amount of different types of products in mathematics. In a certain sense this notion is "on the surface". On the other hand there is a different operation, called "co-product" that seem to be a less intuitive notion (for example, things like co-algebras seem to be not so intuitive). Is there a real asymmetry between these two notions (or is this explained by the human perception?)? This question might turn out to be silly but I have not seen it anywhere and it seem to be a natural question... Motivation. This is not quite a motivation, but what led me to the question is the reflection on the (well known) fact that there is no product operation for homologies but there is one for cohomologies. 

Let $V$ be a subvariety of $\mathbb C^n$ with irreducible components of dimension >$0$. Is $H_{2n-1}(\mathbb C^n\setminus V)=0$? 

Suppose $S^1$ is acting smoothly on $S^n$ and $M$ is a connected component of the set of fixed points of the action. What can be said about $M$? Is it true that $\pi_1(M)=0$? (sorry this first bit of the question is silly since any $S^k$ can appear) Is it true that $M$ has to be homeomorphic to a sphere? If not, what kind of manifolds can one get? 

What is minimal $n$, such that there exists a smooth complex projective manifold $M^n$ satisfying the following two conditions: 1) The group of automorphisms of $M^n$ is $\mathbb C^*$. 2) All the fixed point of the $\mathbb C^*$-action are isolated and the set of fixed points is non-empty. Is it possible to get some sort of classification of such manifolds in low dimensions? Note that $n>2$... 

A Peano curve is a continuous map $[0,1]\to [0,1]^2$ whose image is the whole square. I would like to know if on can obtain "holomorphic" Peano curves. Namely, is it possible to find a continuous map $\phi$ from the unit disk $|z|\le 1$ to $\mathbb C^1$ such that $\phi$ is holomorphic for $|z|<1$ and the image of the boundary $|z|=1$ has non-empty interior in $\mathbb C^1$ under the map $\phi$.
