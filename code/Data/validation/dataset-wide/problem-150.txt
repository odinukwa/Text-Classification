For 99.99% of the cases, meme containment will be automatic. As long as you're traveling to a time period where easy access to information isn't readily available, the majority of the people aren't going to have the means to propagate your meme - thus it dies on the vine, as it were. In other cases, the context of the meme won't make sense to someone without the context - they will infer you're just an outsider speaking about things they don't understand or don't care about. Who cares if you 'Rick-rolled' the King. Is that even a bad thing? What is this 'Rick-Roll' you speak of? Is it edible? So, for the very small subset of cases where a change would actually have some sort of effect, you have three categories of how that change would affect the timeline. In the first, we make the assumption that time is either somewhat self-repairing as in most changes are 'smoothed' out to fix mistakes... OR.... Changes in time propagate up the timeline, making the future-past you remember change as you make them; meaning you'll remember your past as if you'd already made the change you just made. OR... you're creating another universe based on the changes you're making now, meaning the new universe was always the way you just changed it and your old universe never had you changing the past to begin with - because it already happened and never had you visiting there. Of those three choices, I would believe either A or B to be the most likely. And I personally prefer the A scenario; meaning the past will somewhat correct itself of any anomalies you introduce anyway. Thus, to answer your question, I don't think the meme containment is something you need to really be worried about. Most things will be handled on their own. The best way to ensure this is to make sure of the following: Bring back nothing that's out of period, minimize contact with the time-period natives, don't have random philosophical conversations with the few people of the period that might understand the deeper implications of your remarks. 

My current model of how to achieve this is as follows: 1- A interplanetary vessel is built in Earth orbit using reusable rockets descended from the likes of Falcon 9. 2- This interplanetary vessel has living space, propulsion and a solar sail (since that's totally all you need for a mission as complex as a manned interplanetary venture, right?). 3- Attached to the interplanetary vessel is a shuttlecraft designed for flying in low gravity, atmosphere lacking environments since planes wouldn't work on Europa. On Titan, it'd make sense but Europa isn't a jovian moon known for its thick atmosphere. 4- This shuttlecraft is manned and deploys both the encampment (using modular bubblehabs that can be dug into the ice for radiation protection- this is Jupiter so radiation is an inevitable issue) and the submarine that needs to be able to descend all the way to the bottom of Europa's ocean... And back. 5- Said submarine is able to gain energy from the hydrothermal vents if needed (and maybe even ride the convection current back up) and can supply the crew in said sub for about a Month with food. Oxygen in the sub can be derieved from the sorrounding water. The submarine is modelled partially on a bathoscaythe, however it is very simple in shape (very capsule-like, but with a heat drill on the front that likely can double as a defensive weapon encase a sea monster tries to eat it). There are also communication systems and some deployable aquatic probes for sample collection instead of arms like current bathoscathes use. Deploying a human in pressure suit gear might also be possible if the story demands it. However, I have a feeling that a pressure suit for Europa would be somewhat expensive (I state as I detail out a high-tech submarine and a manned space mission more ambitious than anything in human history up to this point). The problem I have is i'm not sure how expensive or massive all this stuff would be. My intuition is that being a manned mission carrying a ship that can deploy both a encampment and a submarine which 4 people can reasonably man is that it'll be a big ship, but i'm not sure how big. The Delta-V of going to Europa, orbitting and going back with a manned vessel also will be pretty intense. The speed of the ship on average would be 5x faster than the Juno Probe as well, putting it at a drifting speed of around 370 km/s. That is about a thousand times slower than the speed of light but still really damn fast. However, assuming no fusion energy how would getting to this speed on the scale of say, weeks be feasible? Gravity slingshot around the Earth? I come here since I don't know anything about the logistics of space travel and want to see how many holes can be picked in it and what I should use to fill those holes in. And also because this is likely going to be insanely difficult to pull off and the more information I have on what would be needed the better, especially in regards to the mass of the three crafts, what prolusion systems to use and how to better structure the time frame of said mission. Also tell me if 16 people is too much or not enough. I just picked the number out of superstition more than anything else. Since it's in 2057 the tech doesn't nessecarily have to be current day, but i'd prefer the tech still be based on or descended from technology in research or on the drawing board today more or less. Fusion energy is off the table, for instance. (As for the life itself, that's all spoilers. It's not Europa native but evolved in Europa-like conditions with the magnetic field of the nearby gas giant, acidic seas and the 'right' balance of tidal stress. The inhabitants didn't become space faring independantly, they gained space age technology from a much more distant entity and technologically degenerated in the thousand years they lived on Europa. They surveyed Earth early on but their ability to speak a human language is likely non-existent beyond a few words. Not to mention they speak more like whales or dolphins than humans. I mention this to anyone who objects to advanced life on Europa here, even if this is not the focus of the question.). 

I think they've already answered your question. It's buried in the math, yes, but it's there. While true that tidal locking is 'inevitable.' This period can be extremely long. The are three factors that determine this period: 

So, if the gas giant captured a planet sized moon with a fast and eccentric orbit, it should take a good long while before it even started to become tidally locked. Use poetic license here would be my advice. 

In short, your vampires might be hosts to some killer virus that alters their metabolisms to feed off of blood. As a bonus, it heightens their senses, increases their reflexes and strength and their ability to heal. In payment, it 'abhors' certain kinds of smells, perhaps the pheromones emitted by uninfected humans when they feel safe cause the virus to avoid the area and instead prefer areas where humans are emitting sexual pheromones (such as near a bar or maybe where prostitutes hang out). This would be way beyond deep at a near instinctual level and would be extremely hard for an infected vampire to fight or ignore. 

Recently i've read Worldbuilding by Stephen Gillett and one thing that struck me was that for one reason of another many of the alien worlds lacked the resources needed for metallurgy. However, the book also mentioned how crystals would be common on at least a couple of these worlds which made me start thinking. Could a advanced species develop on a acidic world (even with less energy available) that instead of using metals, uses crystals, clays some other material in the place of iron/copper and has to advance on very different lines from humans with their steel and silicon chips or those other aliens with their calcium rich bioships and moldy circuitry? Crystals and clays according to the book would be in abundance on the acidic worlds (which is a generalization- the author goes through nitrogen-oxygen worlds, worlds with chlorine rich atmospheres where plastics instead of cellulose is used for wood and sulfur rich worlds, all of these worlds he concludes would lack in iron/copper. Therefore leaving any civilization that develops on a acidic world with chlorine or sulfur all over the place 'In the stone age'. I am skeptical of this simply because is metallurgy really the end-all be-all to even consider technological civilizations? It seems like it is on Earth, but that's more or less because metals are attainable and iron is easily available. But on another world where that's not the case could some other technological base exist and could it still be possible to make a advanced civilization through some alternative form of conductors? Crystals and clays to my knowledge both have diverse applications, but is it possible for them to fill similiarish technological niches seen in the modern world at least in the fields of automation of labor and/or computing? 

While most of this is circumstantial evidence; a lot of it would be clear cut towards Alfred's innocence or extremely difficult to explain away. "And why, exactly, did this illusionary copy of you have your exact boot size and style while carrying Frank's body? In fact, the exact same size and style of boots found downstairs in your basement... covered with mud?" Sure - this kid of evidence is not exactly the same as having murder weapon with prints. But it's very hard to explain away by anyone - even with something like the illusion defense. In fact, the illusion defense makes it even more difficult because the premise there is someone else carried the body and dumped it and they just looked like you. Just some thoughts. I hope these help. 

It is 2057 and a manned mission to Europa has been comissioned in the prospect of further exploring the ecosystem and energy signatures of Europa. Unlike the implied unnmanned probe, this mission logistically has to be able to do the following: 

This is somewhat vaguely related to a old question of mine involving a alien species who spend three thousand years developing a post singularity spaceship armada in the mantle of a lava planet (Industrious). I try being realistic. So realistic that I figured that might somehow not work as planned. My logic at the time was so sound too! "Can't hide in space because of heat signature? Well, let's find some extremely hot place and hide in it where looking for heat signatures is impossible and no one will look anyways". Turns out trying to make a massive underground base in a lava planet has lots of problems. Problems that you can only throw so much technology at. So I wonder. Where in the galaxy is a safe place to hide from some genocidal spaceship entities who wanna kill everyone? And I mean anywhere in the galaxy. Empty space is not a option, too easy to be seen. Cold planets I presume would be useless because of the lack of heat. However, where in the Milky Way galaxy is a safe place to hide from swarms of genocidal aliens that kill anything they detect on sight while building a giant space fleet? -Will a lava planets work? -What about a hot jupiter? -What about near the galactic center? -Are globular or open clusters good or do they come with problems like being too much of landmarks? -Do red dwarfs or brown dwarfs hide things well enough or are they too cold to hide heat signatures? Technological limits are very few here, but hyper-spatial options aren't available. FTL speeds are around 10-20 Ly per day. Wormholes would require moving to other star systems if used. 

Domesticated Honey-Badgers. Dwarven Honey-Badgers. Or maybe Dwarven Underground Domesticated Honey-Bees... But I like the Honey Badgers better, just on principle. 

Let's break it down. First, we have to assume that, aside from magic, this world is primarily the same as our current world. And thus, the laws of physics and so forth still apply. Second, let's apply the Occam's Razor here and go with the idea that the simplest of explanations is usually the correct one. Based on those two premises, let's proceed. Here's what we know. Frank is dead and Alfred was seen with a weapon matching Frank's blood and was also seen dumping a body into the river by multiple witnesses. Alfred's defense was: It wasn't me, someone placed an illusion there and made it look like it was me. If I was the prosecutor I would test the following: 

Splashed with water Exposed to the heat Touched by a human or stabbed by one (in the latter case- do they bleed or does their blood boil away?) 

Be able to enter and return from the subglacial abyssal ocean in Europa. Have a crew of 16 people. (12 people for the surface and 4 people for the submarine) Be able to have both a surface encampment and a sub-surface exploration mission. Be able to retrieve samples back to Earth. Cost less than 250 billion dollars (if unattainable give me your own estimate) Have a travel time of around a year to Europa (those poor bones...) 

As a bonus question, would there be a difference if the Titanian was radiation resistant or would the results be the same? I ask since I am not really certain how to predict any of this.
