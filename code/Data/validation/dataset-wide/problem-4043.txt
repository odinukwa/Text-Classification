I am basically repeating what Nick already said, but it was to long for a comment: There is a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators and strongly continuous one-parameter groups of unitaries (Stone von Neumann Theorem). The one-parameter group for an self-adjoint operator is given by $\{U_A(t):=e^{itA}\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$ and vice versa given $\{U(t)\}_t$ one obtains a self-adjoint (in generally only densely defined) operator $A$ called the generator of $U(t)$ by differentiating $U(t)$ wrt to $t$ and take the value at $t=0$, which can be made precise and can be found in any functional analysis book. In the usual Fock representation of CCR, $t\to W(t f)$, with $W$ the Weyl operator is strongly continuous, and the generator of this one-parameter group is your self-adjoint operator. In your example $W(f)=e^{i (f_1 P+f_2 Q)}$ with $f=(f_1,f_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ is the Weyl operator and the self-adjoint operators $P$ and $Q$ are obtained as above. So in this (unique for finite degrees of freedom) representation of CCR, you see the two quantizations are exactly the same, after you checked that the Weyl relations "infinitesimal" give back the Heisenberg CCR relations. In particular they act on the same Hilbert space. 

(1) Let $\mathcal F$ be a spherical fusion tensor category. Then Müger showed that $R=\bigoplus_{H\in\mathrm{Irr}(\mathcal F)} H\boxtimes H^\mathrm{op}$ canonically has the structure of a Frobenius algebra in $\mathcal F \boxtimes \mathcal F^\mathrm{op}$ and that the category of bimodules ${}_R(\mathcal F \boxtimes \mathcal F^\mathrm{op})_R$ has a braiding which makes it a modular tensor category equivalent to $Z(\mathcal F)$. Further, the "dual" Frobenius algebra is $\hat Q=I(1)$, where $I$ is the induction functor, ie the adjoint of the forgetful functor $F\colon Z(\mathcal F)\to \mathcal F$. (2) Conversely, let $\mathcal C$ be a modular tensor category, then it is the center of a fusion category iff there is a Lagrangian algebra $A\in\mathcal C$, i.e. a commutative (Frobenius) algebra, such that $\dim A^2=\dim\mathcal C$. Namely, the right modules $\mathcal C_A$ have a tensor structure and $$Z(\mathcal C_A)=\mathcal C\cong\mathcal C\boxtimes \overline{\mathcal C_A^0}\cong \mathcal C\boxtimes \mathrm{Vect}\cong \mathcal C$$ Further, I conclude ${}_A\mathcal C_A\cong \mathcal C_A \boxtimes \mathcal C_A^\mathrm{op}$, because $\mathcal C_A^0\cong\mathrm{Vect}$. Question: Let $A\in\mathcal C$ be a Lagrangian algebra. I guess it is true that $A$ and $\hat A$ by (2) are in of the form as in (1), ie $A\cong I(1)$ and $\hat A\cong R$. Is there any reference for such a result, which is citable? Note: A special case when $\mathcal C \cong Z(\mathcal C_0)$ for $\mathcal C_0$ a unitary modular tensor category is contained implicitly in the subfactor literature $URL$ I am particular interested and most comfortable with the case of unitary tensor categories, so feel free to add the right adjectives. 

I would appreciate any reference that contains either a translation or proof of the following interesting observation of Berger (Sur les variétés d’Einstein compactes, M. Berger paper (in French)). 

Harmonic vector fields are critical points of Dirichlet energy function on the set of all unit vector fields on $M$, which is defined as follows: $$E(X):=\frac{1}{2}\int_M\|dX\|^2\mathrm{dVol_g}\qquad X: (M,g)\to (TM,g_s), \|X\|=1.$$ Where it's Euler-Lagrange equation satisfies the following: $$\bar{\Delta}X=\lambda X,\quad \lambda\in C^\infty(M)$$ where $\bar{\Delta}$ denote rough Laplacian. $p$-Harmonic vector field: If we use $p$-energy function instead of Dirichlet energy function: $$E_p(X):=\frac{1}{p}\int_M\|\mathrm{d}X\|^p\mathrm{dVol_g},\qquad X: (M,g)\to (TM,g_s),$$ The Euler-Lagrange equation of $E_p(.)$ in all vector fields (not in unit case) is as follows (for function case see this paper): $$\|dX\|^{p-2}\left(\tau(X) + dX\left(\mathrm{grad}(\log \|dX\|^{p-2})\right)\right) =0.$$ where $\tau(X)=\mathrm{div}(dX)$ called tension field of $X$. My questions are : Question 1: What is the Euler-Lagrange of $E_p(.)$ on the set of all unit vector fields on $M$? Question 2: Did one can hope to get statements which is generalized and new (not same to exactly) 2-harmonic (harmonic vector field) case? Thanks. 

An Introduction to Lie Groups and the Geometry of Homogeneous Spaces written by By Andreas Arvanitogeōrgos is a useful reference Read online here.

Take $C$ to be the category of dualizable $N$-$N$-bimoduls, $N$ a factor. A subfactor $N\subset M$ (or $N_0\subset N$) with finite index and finite depth gives an algebra object $A$ in $C$, namely $A={}_NM_N$ (or ${}_NL^2M_N$ if you prefer) and conversely an algebra object (more precisely a Q-system) gives a subfactor $N\subset M$. Instead of building artificially a category of subfactors, you take the category of (simple) algebra objects (Q-systems) in $C$. Each finite group gives an object $A_G=\bigoplus_{g\in G} {}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ with $\alpha_g$ automorphisms on $N$ such that $\alpha_g\alpha_h=\alpha_{gh}$ for $g,h\in G$ and ${}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ is ${}_NN_N$ seen as a $N$-$N$ bimodule, where the right action is composed with $\alpha$. A morphism $H\to G$ gives a morphism $A_H\to A_G$ between algebra object. This category contains also finite groups, their duals, Kac-algebras and weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. If you want irreducible subfactors, you ask $A$ to be haploid, then you lose weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. This also tells you how a "category of subfactors" should work... 

An euclidean theory which fulfills the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms gives a Wightman theory on Minkowski space via analytical continuation of the correlation function by the $URL$ E.g. a 4 dim theory gives a Wightman theory on 3+1 dim Minkowski space, so there is no additional dimension... 

For Q2 I found the following: In Ricci solitons and real hypersurfaces in a complex space form Cho and Kimura studied on Ricci solitons of real hypersurfaces in a non-flat complex space form and they defined $\alpha-$Ricci soliton $(g,V,\lambda,\mu,\alpha)$, which satisfies the equation $$L_V g + 2S + \lambda g + 2\mu\alpha\otimes\alpha = 0,$$ where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are real constants. In general, we can use this as generelization of $\alpha−$Einstein metric. 

This YouTube video is the intuition behind the Ricci flow in 1-dimensional and discussed by James Isenberg from the University of Oregon. 

In the studies of the calculus of variation, a map $f:M\to N$ said to be harmonic if it is a critical point of the Dirichlet energy function. i. e. \begin{align} E:C^\infty(M,N)&\longrightarrow \Bbb R\\ f&\mapsto E(f) \end{align} In general, a point $p$ in $M_1$ is a critical point of $f:M_1\to M_2$ if the differential $f_{*p}:T_pM_1\to T_{f(p)}M_2$ fails to be surjective. If $M_2=\Bbb R$ then $f$ has a critical point at $p \in M$ if and only if $(df)_p=0$. How to show that $C^\infty(M,N)$ is an infinite dimensional smooth manifold and What is its tangent space at a point $f\in C^\infty(M,N)$? Thanks. 

Q2: As you know Einstein metrics are fixed points of normalized ricci flow equation. Is there a PDE such as normalized ricci flow for $\alpha-$Einstein metrics? Thanks. 

Define a piecewise linear manifold that surrounds a component of the red set. Define an appropriate notion of curvature for piecewise linear manifolds. Show that if the sensitivity at a point is below a certain threshhold, the curvature must vanish there. Show that if the curvature vanishes everywhere, then the manifold has a geometric structure that is inconsistent with the nontriviality condition. 

The rest of this is devoted to fleshing this out a bit. Let $V = ({\mathbf Z}_N)^d$ for some integer $N$. (We don't work in ${\mathbf Z}^d$ because, for the time being at least, we don't want to worry about the possibility that the manifold we will construct is not compact.) Let $G = (V,E)$ be the cubical lattice, which is to say that it is the graph with vertex set $V$ whose edge set $E$ is the set of pairs $\{v,v'\}$ with $v_i \ne v'_i$ for exactly one $i$, for which we have $v'_i = v_i \pm 1$. Geometrically we will think of this as embedded in the torus $(\Re/N{\mathbf Z})^d$, which we endow with the obvious (flat) Riemannian metric. Suppose $V = R \cup B$ where is $R$ and $B$ are nonempty and disjoint. We can assume that subgraph of $G$ induced by $R$ is connected because we can replace $R$ with one of its components. We now want to wrap $R$ in piecewise linear cellophane, which is to say that we will construct a PL hypersurface $M$ that has $R$ on one side and $B$ on the other. The vertex set $W$ of this hypersurface will have one point in each edge in $E$ whose two endpoints have different colors. We now need to say what the simplices of positive dimension are. Let ${\mathbf e}_1, \ldots, {\mathbf e}_d$ be the ``standard unit basis''; we will think of these both as group elements and particular points. To be completely concrete, suppose that the origin is in $R$ and ${\mathbf e}_1$ is in $B$. Then $w_1 = \tfrac13 {\mathbf e}_1$ will be the point in the edge between these points where this edge intersects $M$. We need to define a neighborhood of $w_1$ in $M$. Let's first define the neighbors of $w$ in the 1-skeleton of $M$. Consider $j = 2, \ldots, d$. If ${\mathbf e}_j$ is in $B$, let $w_j = \tfrac13 {\mathbf e}_j$. If ${\mathbf e}_j$ is in $R$ and ${\mathbf e}_1 + {\mathbf e}_j$ is in $B$, let $w_j = \tfrac13 {\mathbf e}_1 + {\mathbf e}_j$. If ${\mathbf e}_j$ and ${\mathbf e}_1 + {\mathbf e}_j$ are in $R$, let $w_j = {\mathbf e}_1 + \tfrac23 {\mathbf e}_j$. Let $w_{-j}$ be what we get from this construction with ${\mathbf e}_j$ replaced by $-{\mathbf e}_j$. We would like to define $M$ to be the union over all such $w_1$ of the union the $(d-1)$-simplices obtained by taking the convex hull of $w_1, w_{i_2}, \ldots, w_{i_d}$ where each $i_j \in \{j,-j\}$. Of course we should verify that $M$ so defined is in fact a manifold, but I want to leave this aside and move on to the question of curvature. (If this construction doesn't work, maybe it can be fixed, or something similar does work.) There are of course many notions of curvature in differential geometry. For many of these it should be possible to define some analogue in the piecewise linear case, but any such project is likely to be tedious, and we would like to find some simpler way. For a surface in three space, the Gaussian curvature can be thought of as the determinant of the Jacobean of the map taking each point in the surface to the unit normal vector in the two sphere. If this curvature vanishes everywhere in some open set, then in this set the surface is locally isometric to flat two space. (This is a special case of Gauss' theorema egregium.) This suggests that we define the $dimension\; of\; flatness$ at $w_1$ to be the dimension of the largest linear subspace (I know we are inside a torus, but you know what I mean) $L$ such that near $w_1$, $M$ agrees with the sum of $L$ and a manifold $N$, and the sum of the dimensions of $L$ and $N$ is $d-1$. We would now like to study the relationship between the dimension of flatness at $w_1$ and the sensitivities at the origin and ${\mathbf e}_1$. Also, the dimension of flatness of the $M$ derived from the Rubinstein example may be a very useful guide to how to proceed. The general idea is that low sensitivity implies a high dimension of flatness, which in turn will have the implication that $M$ is the cartesian product (or a sum, algebraicly) of an $n$-manifold $N$ and a $(d - n - 1)$-dimensional torus. And of course there might be various other ideas to pursue in this general direction. 

Let $(M,g)$ be a $2n$-dimensional almost Hermitian manifold ($n\geq 2$) with a almost complex structure $\cal J$ (not necessary integrable). i.e., $${\cal J}^2=-I,\quad\qquad g({\cal J} X,{\cal J} Y)=g(X,Y).$$ Suppose that $\{X_i,{\cal J}X_i\}$ be any local orthonormal ${\cal J}$-frame and the following relations hold for $i\neq j$ $$K(X_i,X_j)-K(X_j,{\cal J}X_j)=\frac{1}{2n-2}\{\rho(X_i,X_i)-\rho({\cal J}X_j,{\cal J}X_j)\}\tag{1}$$ $$K(X_i,X_j)-K(X_i,{\cal J}X_j)=\frac{1}{2n-2}\{\rho(X_j,X_j)-\rho({\cal J}X_j,{\cal J}X_j)\}\tag{2}$$ where $\rho$ and $K$ are Ricci curvature tensor and sectional curvature respectively. Then 

I looking for a transformation that transforms a non-conformally flat Riemannian manifold to a conformally flat Riemannian manifold. I read definition of Ricci flow but I don't know it is useful or not? and I could not find any references. Are there any sources of this subject? Thanks. 

Update. Remark: Note that if $s=\Delta$ and without repetitive color then the problem reduces to usual edge coloring. this is useful for understanding this problem. 

According to Wikipedia (last edited on 31 March 2017, at 03:48.) the Hadamard conjecture is open still. 

Apart from known example of Prof. Bryant, the authors of the above paper have not provided any references for bolded examples. Does anyone know where can I find this examples? 

Obviously $s\leq \Delta$. Is the following clime true? Could someone provide a counterexample or a sketch of proof for this clime?
