So we have a splitting field $K_n$, explicitly constructed as a quotient of $K_0[r_1, \ldots r_n]$. Let $I$ be the kernel of the obvious map from $K_0[r_1, ... r_n]$ to $K_n$. The algorithm above also gives us a Gröbner basis for $I$: for each of the polynomials $q_i$, with $2 \leq i \leq n$ let $q'_i$ be a lift of $q_i$ to a monic polynomial with coefficients in the polynomial ring $K_0[r_1, ... r_{i - 1}]$. Then it is easy to see that $B:=\{q_1(r_1), q'_2(r_2), ... q'_n(r_n)\}$ is a Gröbner basis for $I$ with the lexicographic monomial ordering with $r_n > r_{n-1} > ... > r_1$. In general, if we have a ring $R$ with an ideal $J$, an automorphism $f: R \rightarrow R$ will induce an automorphism of $R/J$ iff $J$ is $f$-invariant, i.e. $f(x) \in J$ whenever $x \in J$. In particular, if $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\{ r_1 \ldots r_n \}$, and $f_\sigma$ is the corresponding automorphism of $K_0[r_1, ... r_n]$, we have that $f_\sigma$ induces an automorphism of $K_n$ iff $I$ is $f_\sigma$-invariant, or equivalently, $f_\sigma(b) \in I$ for each $b \in B$. Furthermore, we can test if $f_\sigma(b) \in I$ with multivariate division, which is convenient as $B$ is already a Gröbner basis for $I$. In summary, we can check if a permutation $\sigma$ of the roots of $p$ is in the Galois group by checking if $f_\sigma(b) \in I$ for each $b \in B$, and this can be done with multivariate division. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Fix a pair $T\subseteq B\subseteq G$ of a maximal torus and Borel subgroup, and let $\mathfrak{t}$ denote the Lie algebra of the maximal torus. Let $W=N_G(T)/T$ be the Weyl group. The Chevalley Restriction Theorem states that the the natural map $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]\rightarrow\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{t}]$ restricts to a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra isomorphism $$\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]^G\xrightarrow{\cong}\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{t}]^W.$$ The latter is generated by $r=rk(G)$ algebraically independent polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_r$. Now, one has the root-space decomposition $$\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{t}\oplus\bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Delta}\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}.$$ For each root $\alpha\in\Delta$, choose a non-zero root vector $e_{\alpha}\in\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}$. If $\alpha\in\Pi$ is a (positive) simple root, set $h_{\alpha}:=[e_{\alpha},e_{-\alpha}]\in\mathfrak{t}$. Note that $$\{e_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in\Delta}\cup\{h_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in\Pi}$$ is then a basis of $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $$\{e_{\alpha}^*\}_{\alpha\in\Delta}\cup\{h_{\alpha}^*\}_{\alpha\in\Pi}$$ be the associated dual basis of $\mathfrak{g}^*$. $\textbf{Question}:$ Is there a way to choose the generators $f_1,\ldots,f_r$ so that each is nicely expressible as a polynomial in the indeterminates $\{e_{\alpha}^*\}_{\alpha\in\Delta}\cup\{h_{\alpha}^*\}_{\alpha\in\Pi}$? This question is rather vague, but I'm really just looking for explicit expressions of the $f_1,\ldots,f_r$ in terms of the $\{e_{\alpha}^*\}_{\alpha\in\Delta}\cup\{h_{\alpha}^*\}_{\alpha\in\Pi}$. 

If $G$ is a simply-connected Lie group, then any Lie group morphism $G\rightarrow S^1$ factors through the universal cover $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow S^1$ to give a Lie group morphism $G\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ (by requiring the identity in $G$ to be sent to $0$). This gives a bijection between the Lie group $Hom$ sets. Is this the sort of answer you were seeking? 

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra of the group $G$. You might consider reading about the Springer resolution $$\mu:T^*(G/B)\rightarrow\mathcal{N},$$ where $\mathcal{N}$ is the nilpotent cone of $\mathfrak{g}$. The fibres of this map are isomorphic over individual adjoint orbits of $G$. These are called Springer fibres. For each such fibre, there is a representation of the Weyl group on its Borel-Moore homology (or dually, its cohomology). The fibre above $0$ is the zero-section of $T^*(G/B)$, giving us a representation of $W$ on $H^*(G/B)$. A reference would be Representation Theory and Complex Geometry, by Chriss and Ginzburg. 

The system is $i u_t + c_0 u_{xx} + u_{yy} = c_1 |u|^2 u + c_2 u \phi_x,\,$ $\phi_{xx} + c_3 \phi_{yy} = ( |u|^2 )_x.\,$ This is like the NLS but with the extra y-dimension. The NLS has the lagrangian formulation $\mathcal{L}=\frac{i}{2}(\psi_{t}\bar{\psi}-\psi\bar{\psi}_{t})-|\bigtriangledown\psi|^{2}+|\psi|^{4}.$ For DS since we have two eqns and unknowns, we will have two Euler-Lagrangian equations. But I was wondering if there is a way to express them as one Lagrangian (to make applying Noether's theorem easier). 

Many times I find myself going through analysis books, wikipedia and papers, looking for what is known for my functions/objects at hand. So is there any software that at least tries to move in that direction i.e. putting any hypotheses and spit out list of possible conclusions. For example, inputting univalent on unit disk, could output the top 10 results on them from a large database. In fact, it should be fun programming it myself if it has not been done yet. I understand that a big part of math research is coming across unexpected results while reading through papers for something else. But hey why not have additional help. 

In "Percolation in the hyperbolic plane" the authors study the properties of percolation in the hyperbolic plane. Smirnov and others proved convergence of isotropic percolation to SLE(6). Do these results follow for the hyperbolic case too? Findings: 1)L. Arosio, F. Bracci, "Infinitesimal generators and the Loewner equation on complete hyperbolic manifolds," So there is a natural candidate. thanks 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected, complex, semisimple Lie group with Lie algebra $\frak{g}$, and let $\xi\in\frak{g}$ be a nilpotent element. I am interested in understanding the structure of $C_{\frak{g}}(\xi)=\{\eta\in\frak{g}:[\xi,\eta]=$0$\}$, $C_G(\xi)=\{g\in G:Ad_g(\xi)=\xi\}$, and $\pi_0(C_G(\xi))=C_G(\xi)/C_G(\xi)_0$. I would appreciate any references you suspect would give useful structural information. Also, I would welcome any advice and suggestions. Thanks! 

You can prove that $G/H$ is quasi-projective, and a reference is Theorem 4.4.1 of Algebraic Quotients, Torus Actions, and Cohomology by A. Bialynicki-Birula, ‎J. Carrell, ‎and W.M. McGovern. 

Let $G$ be a compact Lie group with real representation ring $RO(G)$. Recently, I have been learning about some aspects of $RO(G)$-graded cohomology theories (for a precise definition, see Chapter XIII of May's book, Equivariant Homotopy and Equivariant Cohomology). One impetus for introducing this definition is that it allows one to properly formulate an equivariant analogue of the suspension isomorphism. Indeed, if $E_G^*$ is an $RO(G)$-graded theory with reduced counterpart $\tilde{E}_G^*$, then we have natural $\mathbb{Z}$-module isomorphisms $$\tilde{E}_G^{\alpha}(X)\cong\tilde{E}_G^{\alpha+V}(\Sigma^V(X)).$$ Here, $\alpha\in RO(G)$, $V$ is a real orthogonal $G$-module, $X$ is a $G$-space, and $\Sigma^V(X)$ is its equivariant reduced suspension with respect to $V$. To recover an underlying $\mathbb{Z}$-grading, one identifies a non-negative integer $n$ with the trivial $G$-module $[\mathbb{R}^n]\in RO(G)$ so that $$\tilde{E}_G^n(X):=\tilde{E}_G^{[\mathbb{R}^n]}(X).$$ The usual suspension isomorphism then determines the negative grading components of $\tilde{E}_G^*$. $\textbf{Question:}$ Suppose that $V$ is a finite-dimensional orthogonal $G$-representation. What is the relationship between $E_G^{n+V}(\text{pt})$ and $E_G^{n+\dim(V)}(\text{pt})$? I suspect this is well-known and understood. Yet, I am having difficulty finding references that directly address this issue. I would therefore appreciate any and all advice concerning references. 

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and $p$ a prime number. Let $K_i$ be the cyclotomic field containing exactly the $np^i$th roots of unity. Let $H$ be the inverse limit of $p$-power torsion of the class groups of the $K_i$. Let $V$ be the $\mathbb{Q}_p$ - vector space $H \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{Q}_p$. It is a result of Iwasawa theory that $V$ is finite-dimensional. For any integer $q$ that is relatively prime to $np$, we have an automorphism $f_q$ of $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} K_i$ which, for each root of unity $\omega$, brings $\omega^q$ to $\omega$. This induces an automorphism of $H$ and thus an automorphism of $V$, say $f^*_q$. What I'm interested in is whether $\mathrm{Tr}(f^*_q) \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ is rational, and related questions. Are there situations where we know this is the case, besides obvious cases like $q = 1$ or $V$ is trivial etc.? Are there situations where we know this isn't the case? Are there related operators on $V$ that nontrivially have rational trace? Can we ever say something weaker like $\mathrm{Tr}(f_q)$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$? The reason I ask: Given a smooth projective curve $C$ over a finite field $K$ with algebraic closure $\overline{K}$, the $q$th power Frobenius morphism on $C$ induces the $\overline{K}$-linear Frobenius morphism on $\overline{C} = C \otimes_{K} \overline{K}$, which induces an endomorphism of the $\ell$-adic cohomology vector space $H^1(\overline{C}, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$. The traces of powers of this morphism yield information about the zeta function of the curve, but the only reason this works is that these traces are rational numbers (more specifically, integers) so they can be seen as both $\ell$-adic numbers or as real numbers, the latter being what we need for applications to the zeta function. To relate this to the original question, I don't think these $f_q$ morphisms are analogous to powers of the $\overline{K}$-linear Frobenius, but rather a closely related morphism, which could be briefly described as the "inverse Frobenius on coefficients", and whose powers still induce endomorphisms of the $\ell$-adic cohomology vector spaces which have rational traces which give us essentially the same information as the $\overline{K}$-linear Frobenius. So basically I want to know if a similar thing holds in the number field setting, with $V$ playing the role of $H^1(\overline{C}, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$, in hopes that it might yield interesting information pertaining to non-p-adic L-functions (although I don't expect anything nearly as straightforward as in the function field case). 

Random Voronoi percolation is described in "The critical probability for random Voronoi percolation in the plane is 1/2" . They mention that Schramm and Benjamini, showed a form of conformal invariance. I am wondering, if we have any evidence that Random Voronoi should have an SLE as its scaling limit eg. numerical? Do we also know which $\kappa$? 

My original problem is to see if the following pde develops blow-ups in $(-L,L)$ $$u_{t}=u_{xx}+g(t)(u_{x})^{2}$$ for periodic boundary $u_{0}(-L)=u_{0}(L)$, where $0<g(t)<1$; specifically $g(t)=\Phi(\frac{\beta-t}{\beta})=\int_{-\infty}^{t}e^{-s^{2}}ds$ for some $\beta>0$. Do you think it blows-up? Any suggestions on books or papers that treat a similar pde? For $g(t)\equiv 1$, this is called the Potential Burgers equation as can be seen by differentiating and setting $v=u_{x}$. Attempt So to start I am checking $u_{t}=(u_{x})^{2}$ for blow-ups. We differentiate it and set $v=u_{x}$ to obtain $$v_{t}-2vv_{x}=0,$$ and by MOD $v(x,t)=v_{0}(x+t2v_{0}(x_{0}))$. So there is a blow-up if there exist $x_{1}<x_{2}$ with $$\frac{1}{-2v_{0}(x_{1})}>\frac{1}{-2v_{0}(x_{2})}.$$ Assuming $v_{0}>0$ we obtain $v_{0}(x_{1})>v_{0}(x_{2})$, which can happen for periodic IC as in our case (eg. exp(cos(x))). Next we check $u_{t}=g(t)(u_{x})^{2}\Rightarrow v_{t}-2g(t)vv_{x}=0$. By MOC we get curve $x(s)=-2v_{0}(x_{0})\int^{s}_{0} g(r)dr+x_{0}$ and thus $$v(x,t)=v_{0}(x+2v_{0}(x_{0})\int^{t}_{0} g(r)dr).$$ The derivative of the curve is $\frac{dx}{dt}=-2v_{0}(x_{0})g(t)$, so it's not clear from here. Two curves are equal if $$v_{0}(x_{1})-v_{0}(x_{2})=\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{\int^{t_{int}}_{0} g(r)dr},$$ for some $x_{i}$ and time $t_{int}$. Now I am trying to use Implicit FT to prove existence of such $x_{i},t_{i}$. But even if it does it is not clear that the original PDE blows-up For example, Burgers ($u_{t}=u_{xx}-u_{x}u$) doesn't blow-up but the semilinear heat equation ($u_{t}=u_{xx}+u^{2}$) does. So next I will try to mimic techniques from Burgers and Semilinear heat equation (Evans chapter 9) to find blow-ups. Interestingly, by assuming $g(t)\equiv 1$ we obtain that $u=Log(\phi)$, where $\phi$ satisfies the heat eqn $\phi_{t}=\phi_{xx}$. Since $\phi$ can be negative, we consider the complex logarithm. This can present blow-ups, so it is natural to guess that the PDE above will also. However, it is not totally clear because as $t\to \infty$ the $g(t)\to 0$. Very cool stuff. From numerical analysis (pseudo-spectral method with IC 8*exp(cos(x/128)) a blowup develops close to time 0.17. 

As a graded $\mathbb{Z}$-module, the structure of the group cohomology $H^{*}(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z};\mathbb{Z})$ is extremely well-known. Yet, I am having difficulty finding a reference concerning its cup product structure. I assume this is also well-known, but I would appreciate a reference containing a precise statement of the $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra structure. 

I'm not sure I have a direct answer to your question, but here are some thoughts. I would suggest you investigate some of the literature on "flat" connections. It is precisely the flatness condition that allows you to obtain a cochain complex for computing cohomology. More explicitly, suppose that $E\rightarrow X$ is a vector bundle on a manifold $X$. I will think of a connection as an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map $$\nabla:\Gamma_{E}\rightarrow\Gamma_{E}\otimes_{C^{\infty}(X)}\Omega_X^1,$$ where $\Gamma_E$ is the sheaf of smooth sections of $E$ and $\Omega_X^1$ is the sheaf of $1$-forms on $X$. Note that $\nabla$ naturally gives rise to associated maps $$\nabla:\Gamma_{E}\otimes_{C^{\infty}(X)}\Omega_X^k\rightarrow\Gamma_{E}\otimes_{C^{\infty}(X)}\Omega_X^{k+1}.$$ Flatness is then the condition $$\nabla^2=0,$$ so that you have a cochain complex $$\Gamma_{E}\rightarrow\Gamma_{E}\otimes_{C^{\infty}(X)}\Omega_X^1\rightarrow\Gamma_{E}\otimes_{C^{\infty}(X)}\Omega_X^{2}\rightarrow\ldots.$$ The cohomology of this complex can be interesting. If you take the trivial line bundle over $X$ with the exterior derivative as connection, then you recover the deRham cohomology of $X$. In other cases, you obtain things other than deRham cohomology. The things you are differentiating are sections of certain vector bundles, and you are differentiating them with a choice of connection. I hope this is useful. 

Let $X$ be a complex variety acted upon algebraically by a complex torus $T$. Suppose that $\{X_{\beta}\}_{\beta\in S}$ is a finite $T$-equivariant stratification of $X$, so that the $X_{\beta}$ are smooth locally closed subvarieties and $$\overline{X_{\beta}}\subseteq\bigcup_{\gamma\leq\beta}X_{\gamma}.$$ For fixed $\beta\in S$, we have the equivariant Thom-Gysin sequences $$\ldots\rightarrow H_T^{i-2d(\beta)}(X_{\beta})\rightarrow H_T^i(\bigcup_{\gamma\geq\beta}X_{\gamma})\rightarrow H_T^i(\bigcup_{\gamma>\beta}X_{\gamma})\rightarrow\ldots,$$ where $d(\beta)$ is the complex codimension of $X_{\beta}$ in $X$. The idea is to inductively compute $H_T^*(X)$ from a knowledge of $H_T^*(X_{\beta})$ for each $\beta\in S$. This seems eminently possible if the partial order on $S$ is a total order. In this case, $X=\bigcup_{\gamma\leq\beta}X_{\gamma}$, where $\beta\in S$ is the maximal element. However, there are some interesting examples in which $S$ is not totally ordered. Consider the nilpotent cone $\mathcal{N}$ of a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The nilpotent cone has a stratification into the nilpotent $G$-orbits, where $G$ is the simply-connected group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. $\textbf{Question}:$ Are there some general ways which to inductively compute $H_T^*(X)$ from the $H_T^*(X_{\beta})$ assuming only that $S$ is partially ordered? Are there some nice examples of this in the literature?
