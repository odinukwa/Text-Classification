So the issue is not with downfalls as such but the cause of these downfalls: not simply bad fortune ("bad luck") but a flaw in the character itself. Since nobody is flawless, this is neither misanthropic nor belittling. 

Goodreads lists an annotated Kindle edition (ASIN: B00751IMZM), but I can't find a trace of it on Amazon, so I don't know whether it fits my criteria. (The Kindle version from Signet Classics doesn't appear to have annotations.) 

Philip Stubbes or Stubbs, writing before the start of Shakespeare's career as a dramatist, criticised this type of crossdressing in his book Anatomie of Abuses (1583). So what was the first English Renaissance play that involved women disguising as men? Update in response to various comments: 

The source is Aristotle's Poetics, presumably written around 335 BC. In the publicly accessible translation by F. A. Fyfe (Harvard University Press & Heinemann, 1932), the quote is in section 1452b of the Poetics (emphasis added): 

"Prince" here means "ruler", not "the king's son". Nevertheless, based on Bacon's condemnation of revenge, Hamlet should have devised a different way to extricate himself from Claudius's plot, and Rosencrantz's and Guildenstern's deaths are not justified. Finally, there's early 21-st century Europe, where I live. Within this framework, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern do not deserve to die for carrying a letter, the contents of which they do not know (III.iii.1-25 mention the stability of the kingdom as a reason for sending Hamlet away), or for spying on Hamlet on behalf of Claudius (which Hamlet truly hates, especially from former schoolfriends; see IV.ii). 

The Scarlet Letter, Chapter II As time passes, the letter changes in meaning. Some people "refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification". The A comes to mean "able" in their minds. (Chapter XII) Eventually, the letter becomes somewhat sacred: 

Not really private islands, and they don't really retire either. When a star is old enough and has lost enough power, it can go to one of the islands on the Eastern Ocean. While there, it recovers its strength and becomes young again by eating "fire-berries". 

The scarlet letter has many meanings in the context of the story. In the beginning, it represented a sin and crime committed. As the story (and Hester) move on though, it becomes a symbol to be proud of (at least in Hester's mind): 

(I don't remember the main character's name) The book opened with the main character (an old man) living on a mostly abandoned world. I don't remember the exact setting, but it was barren of sapient life. There were animals that were like a cross between a racoon, komodo dragon, and velociraptor. They were sentient and hostile to humans, but the main character had somehow tamed them so they didn't attack him. A woman visits the man, asking for his help with something. I'm fairly certain it's not explicitly stated in the story yet, but the man understands what she wants. He refuses. It turns out there are two rival factions warring for control of pretty much everything, and he doesn't want to participate in the war. Furthermore, he doesn't trust the woman to be who she claims to be (she says she's from faction A, but she might be from B) At some point in here another man appears, heavily injured and unconscious. I don't remember much about this, except I'm fairly certain the woman kills the unconscious man. The story culminates with the reveal of the a piece of technology. This is some sort of wristband that allows the wearer to warp between parallel Earths. The old man's version of the device was older and in the form of a belt. There was an asteroid. In different versions of the Earths, the asteroid went from overshooting it on the right, to hitting the edge, to full-on collision, then hitting the left edge, to missing, etc. The old man was living on a planet where the asteroid had come close enough to obliterate life, but not actually hit and destroy the planet. The woman turned out to be evil (shocker amirite) and stole something (I think) from the old man. He chased her, and she kept running and warping from world to world. At some point they even warped to a place where the asteroid had completely destroyed the planet and there wasn't even an atmosphere. At the end, it turns out the old man was the creator of this technology. He couldn't live in a world with that tech being constantly used, so he left to live like a hermit on an Earth far away. He had created the device, and another person had refined it into a lightweight wrist device. He spared the woman and told her to leave, but she still tried to kill him. She failed, and I'm fairly certain the old man just left her for the komodo-racoon-raptor beasts to kill. He packed up camp and left for a more distant world, possibly using up the rest of his device's battery. At the end, the leader of the pack of the komodoraptors was implied to have gained human-like intelligence, implying that it would start a dog-eat-dog style civilization. Lastly, I'm fairly certain the reason the old man didn't like the technology was because he thought it would lead (spoiler: it did) to humanity exterminating other versions of humanity and pretty much any other animals they came across, cutting off their future and preventing them from evolving further. The ending possibly implied that he realized what the komodo lizards would become, but maybe not. I'm fairly certain I read this story in a collection of short stories from assorted authors, again in the US about 6 months to a year ago. 

Rhyme isn't just a bit of fancy dress for verse; it makes verse more memorable. It has even be argued that the rhyming tetrameters do not simply set them apart from the other characters but put them above nobility. ("Ordinary people" speak in prose, noble characters usually speak in blank verse, while rhyming lines are normally reserved for a special purpose. See Why do the witches in 'Macbeth' speak in rhyme? on eNotes.) 

When Richard Jones compared four English translations of Racine's Phèdre—by Richard Wilbur, R.C. Knight, Robert Lowell and Margaret Rawlings—he found that they all used pentameters. This corresponds with what Kenneth Muir said. Whereas French counts the number of syllables per line, English counts the number of feet per line. Gretchen McCulloch points out in her article "The Language of Poetry" that the importance of stressed syllables in English is illustrated by limericks. In a limerick, the number of stressed syllables per line is 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, respectively, but the number of syllables can vary. The above does not imply that English verse drama couldn't use anything else than iambic pentameter or that French verse drama couldn't use anything else then alexandrines, but it shows that the both languages' "affordances" (Gretchen McCulloch's term) make the opposite less likely. 

It's unknown, but it appears that although The Epic of Gilgamesh was written first, the Pentateuch (part of the Bible containing the creation stories) has the first description of the flood story. From the Idaho University page on The Epic of Gilgamesh: 

The Scarlet Letter, Chapter XIII In short, the letter started as a badge of sin, but due to Hester's actions later it became something, if not to be proud of, not to be ashamed of. 

TL;DR of this answer: There are definitely gender stereotypes here, of a more violent male passage vs a gentle female one. However, it's also a different resolution of the narrative. You can think of it as saying "gentleness will lead to a better end", but again it's unclear if this is what the author intended. It's also highly likely it was just a publicity stunt. Heck, if you even asked this question it sorta worked. Who knows, maybe the author intended people to read stuff into it that he didn't write. 

I was re-reading The Silver Chair recently, the 6th book in the Narnia series. Towards the end of the novel, 

The poem both honors their bravery, but notes that their bravery got them killed. To quote this article, "Tennyson's soldiers are bold, heroic, glorious, honourable, noble and dead." 

In both editions, the poem "Frühling" is part of a section titled "Aus den Jahren 1899–1902" ("From the years 1899–1902"); in the collected works, Volker Michels dates the poem to April 1899. It is not entirely clear from the information in these editions whether the poem was part of the volume Gedichte that Hesse published in 1902. Hesse wrote around 1400 poems, 800 of which were printed in 15 collections he published during his lifetime. By the way, Hesse wrote several other poems titled "Frühling", namely in 1907 (first line: "Der laue März und der feuchte April"), another one in 1907 (first line: "Es fahren leise junge Wolken durchs Blaue"), yet another one in May 1907 (first line: "Wieder schreitet er den braunen Pfad"), one in 1909 (first line: "Seit wir, wilde Knabenhorden") and one on 25 March 1915 (first line: "Am Waldrand tränen die Knospen"). So someone who doesn't check the first lines may get the dates mixed up. The first collected edition of Hesse's poems, Gesammelte Dichtungen (in 6 volumes), was published in 1952; since this is several years after the Four Last Songs, this edition can't have been Strauss's source. The only other volume of Hesse's poems from the years 1945–1962 was Stufen, which contains a selection that Hesse made at the request of his publisher. This selection was meant to replace the much bigger volume Die Gedichte from 1924, which had gone out of print. This 1924 edition already contained a section titled "Aus den Jahren 1899–1902" (see above). Hesse also wrote three poems titled "September"; the one that Strauss set to music dates from 23 September 1927. "Beim Schlafengehen", the third of Strauss's Four Last Songs, dates from July 1911. So James McColley Eilers is definitely mistaken when he claims (emphasis added): 

Here is also a list of place names and their equivalents, taken from the book linked above: (warning - really long) Wessex - Name - Region of Wessex Actual Name 

Rose doesn't recognize him, and when questioned about how to leave (to get to the Keep of Time), he abruptly tells them to try the trump again, and walks away. However, before they leave, he tells Rose: 

He also wrote more stories after LOTR, in addition to a couple (non-fiction) research papers before that. So he wasn't entirely new to writing in general. 

The only occurrence of "church" in the book is in the preface, "From the Publisher to the Reader". This is also fictional but not really part of the events of the book. 

There isn't a direct relationship, but here's a map drawn by Bertam Windle based on his correspondence with Hardy: 

It's well known that Silverberg wrote novels based on some of Asimov's stories. For example, The Child of Time was based off of The Ugly Little Boy, and Nightfall was based off the Asimov story of the same name. How many other (if any) novels/books/other works did Silverberg base off of Asimov stories? 

Hyperion and Endymion are poems by the famous poet John Keats, both based on Greek mythology. Hyperion talks about the Titan's despairing after their defeat by the Olympians, and was written in 1818-1819. Endymion is based on the myth of Endymion, where the moon goddess Selene falls in love with him, a king and son of Zeus. Are these poems supposed to be related to each other? They both cover Greek mythology, which prompted my question. 

I agree with your statement that "he openly admits that he's going along with Directive 10-289 because he's a racketeer". In discussions with the looters, Kinnan is aloof and jaded, and seems to despise them. He plays along with them as long as they'll keep his racket going. He knows they know it's a racket, but they're terribly afraid of unions because of their collective power and because it would be politically unpopular to cut them off or throw them under the bus. Kinnan is a crook, an exploiter, and a realist. But he is not a killer like Floyd Ferris or James Taggart. Consider the following from each: Floyd Ferris: 

John Galt was a genius. He invented "the motor" and executed the greatest strike in world history. And it's clear that he understood the danger he was always in (out in the world) and how the looters operate. So it has always been puzzling to me why, at the end of Atlas Shrugged, Galt thought it was a good idea to go back to the world so quickly after the final crash and bring all the strikers with him. Granted, the lights had gone out in NYC, the Taggart bridge had collapsed, and the nation was near starvation. But the political leaders such as Mr. Thompson and all his cronies were still--at least to some degree--in power. If the strikers had come back and started fixing everything, why would anyone believe that Thompson's gang wouldn't have immediately started exploiting them, regulating them, taxing them to death, and controlling them? I would have thought that the strikers needed to wait long enough for the current government leaders to be swept from power and run out of town, clearing the way for the strikers' return. Rand makes it clear that the strikers cared little for political power, so we cannot assume that upon their return they would have tried to step into the shoes of political power in order to achieve their goals. They simply would have gone back to work, and once again been exploited by the looting politicians. Admittedly, we don't know how much time passed between the rescue flight back from the State Science Institute and the moon-lit walk in the valley in which Galt declares to Dagney that "we're going back", but it certainly seems as though very little time had elapsed. Weeks? Days? 

Some members of the Kingsguard are of noble descent (most notably Jaime Lannister), but they don't need to be, unlike, for example, the Vatican's Noble Guard (1801-1970). However, I don't think that the oath is "for life" in these organisations; George R. R. Martin likes taking historical examples to an extreme. 

are a continuation in the same vein. Human speech, unlike the barking of a dog to a crow, has meaning to humans; Benedick's words have as little meaning to her as a dog's barking. One should not too quickly jump to the conclusion that she considers Benedick's words as "annoying noise" (see Mithrandir's answer). It was perfectly possible for Elizabethans to consider the sound of barking as pleasant. Witness the following passage from Act IV, Scene 1 in A Midsummer Night's Dream, where Hyppolita talks about a hunting experience (emphasis mine): 

Kenneth Muir (1907–1996) was an eminent and very productive Shakespeare scholar. Wikipedia has a short article about him that leaves out many lesser-known facts: 

Lassalle fragt Herbert nach Sonja. Die Szene ein Salon is a three-act play by the German author Christoph Hein. The play was first performed in 1980 in East Germany and criticizes Marxism. In the 1860s, Ferdinand Lasalle founded the first German labour party (one of the first socialist parties in Europe) but is not very active in the play. His private matters get in the way of his party work, so a delegation of workers needs to be sent away three times during the play. Lassalle's mother, Ms Lassal (no typo here!), who lives with her son, doesn't seem to have any impact on what is going on; the summary in the German Wikipedia article about the play does not even mention her. However, she is one of only four characters who appears in each of the three acts and she is the first character to appear in the first act, so it is unlikely that she meaningless. We learn early in the play that she secretly steals pieces of cake from the kitchen and that she puts her fingers in the jam in the kitchen; later we even learn that she wets her bed every night. So she is too out of the ordinary to be meaningless, but what does she represent?
