I had a similar problem as well. In my case, the other employee's reason for opening the blinds was to get a bit more light in their corner, where light was somewhat insufficient. The solution for me was simple: I would close the blind as far as necessary to make me able to see the screen, but it was still open enough let some light through. The next step was obvious: go to management and ask for better lighting. The main point in this issue is understanding. They need to understand why you close the blind, but ideally, you should know why they open it, too. Presumably, they don't simply open it to spite you, though I suppose that's possible. Once you understand each others' motivations, you can work out a solution, and if necessary, request better lighting from management or even (very much dependent on work situation) switch work stations. 

I've been in a very similar situation just lately. It's great that you feel concern for your current company, but in the end, you should look at your own interests first of all, as the company is doing the same (supposedly). If your boss knows since May that they need new developers and still hasn't hired anyone, that's your problem only inasmuch as it's keeping your workload high too; however, the problem is theirs to solve, not yours. I suggest either of these two options: 

Not some deep profound answer, but since this appears to be a recurring issue in your case, I'll just add an idea that worked in a university I'm affiliated with where they had a recurring issue with noise during examinations. One thing that can work, if there is a hallway outside the offices, is simply to put up a brightly coloured "Shhh... Please be quiet!" sign outside the office. Make sure it's very visible: one university I was at complained that even a sign in the middle of the corridor wasn't working, so they put up a red flashing bicycle light on top of the sign. They've rarely had problems since. Evidently, you should check for departmental permission before just putting up such a sign. However, if you can, it will have two major positive effects: 

I think that from your points it already shows fairly well, that it is most likely not going to do you a service to continue this in the long run. 

At this point you should make it clear that focusing on the issue in project X was the explicit request of your line manager, not your own idea. Like "Well, my line manager requested we deal with an urgent issue in project X before completing project XX. X has some internal problems that can be solved only by end of week." From this point on, they can (hopefully) fight it out between themselves. In case your line manager backs up saying he didn't explicitly request anything like that, it may have been a misunderstanding etc., you should request a private talk with him asap to address the issue, however unpleasant that feels to you. You should make it clear to him that your successful cooperation depends on mutual trust between the two of you, but double-talk ruins trust. One of the possible outcomes may be that in the future you only take such requests from him in explicit written form. Or that before complying to such requests, you always go and double check with the mini-CEO. And this leads to the underlying problem, which seems to be an unclear allocation of responsibilities. Why is it that both the mini-CEO and your line manager can make decisions about the allocation of resources to projects, and prioritization of tasks? You should strive to make responsibilities clear in this respect. There should ultimately be one single person to make the call. Find out who that is, and listen to him/her from then on. 

...since even when you have done the research, there may be too many options to choose from, I would recommend keeping three things in mind: 1. Be open and honest You don't have to shy away from the facts. Honestly tell the potential interviewer that you are swamped with interviews and really can't handle them all. Explain that you have already committed to other interviews, and that you simply can't handle all the possibilities. Though I don't recommend this approach, I know someone in IT who actually used the fact that he had multiple interviews offered to bargain his salary up before the actual interview. 2. Be appreciative Emphasize the fact that while you cannot take the interview, it really is a good fit for you, and you appreciate the prospective employer taking the time to make the offer. Express gratitude for his taking the time to make the offer. 3. Leave the door open as much as possible Offer to call him / her back if ever the other interviews fall through. It might not work with all employers, but some would be just as glad to have the possibility of having you call back later, and it leaves the door open if ever the other companies don't end up being a good fit. 

I don't think it matters directly. I.e. I can't imagine any recruiter paying attention to which city you got your experience with technology X in. Your choice has indirect consequences though. In big cities with busy IT life, you obviously have more work opportunities to choose from in the long run, but also fiercer competition. More challenges can help you grow, but can also crush you. Moreover, you have more opportunities to network with like minded people, participate in local user groups etc. which can help improving your skills and career chances if used wisely. However, now in the internet age, you can self study and connect to fellow developers from almost everywhere if you have the determination. And one final point, which may actually be the most important in the long run: career growth and salary are good things, up to a point. But (IMHO) these shouldn't be the sole aim of one's life, rather just means to create and secure the life one desires. So the overall quality of life is important. Making a big career and earning lots of money via spending a large part of your life in a city which is polluted, ugly and hostile may actually make you burn out or even ill in the long run, which, needless to say, breaks your career too. Depending on your preferences, you may very well be better off living in a clean, beautiful and friendly place even if you earn less money and don't get as high promotions as fast. But happiness and satisfaction with your life makes you perform better at work too in the long term. 

Suggest he take off his shoes. @DavidSchwartz's answer is excellent. If, however, he does not want to invest in anything, and your workplace is comfortable with this, he could simply take off his shoes. Very likely, he's building up static because either his chair or his shoes are not grounding as necessary to keep from building up static. I know it can sound very unprofessional in some domains - and it is - so I don't suggest it unless your workplace is very relaxed and is absolutely fine with him doing just that. For instance, if there are high profile clients going in and out of your office all the time, don't do it. But if you're a kind of back-end tech company who basically sits in a back room all day, this could be an option. 

Sounds like your problem is not so much with communication skills in general as with understanding and using English (a foreign language to you - as for many of us). To improve this, you need more practice and experience with English. Probably you aren't the only one having such problems at your company, so I suggest you to start by discussing this with your coworkers to find others in the same situation. The more you are, the more weight your plea has when you turn to management for help (which should be the next step). Management may help you by arranging (or sponsoring) training with native English teachers to improve your English vocabulary (in general or on a specific area/domain), verbal skills, comprehension of specific accent(s), expressing your thoughts flexibly and effectively etc. If this is unattainable, you may try enrolling to an English course yourself, or do self study: 

Communicate with your superior. From what you're saying, it sounds like your responsibility is essentially to get the job done at the price and in the time that your superior expects. From what I'm reading, at any rate, it sounds like you're basically a facilitator between the superior and the subordinates to, as you said, keep them "on track." When something like this comes up, your superior has to know about it. He is the one whose pocket is going to be hit: essentially, it sounds like you are there to keep this kind of thing from happening. When you talk to him, you should clarify at least two things: 1. Is this person your subordinate? You mentioned that it wasn't official that you are really responsible for this person. If you aren't, this issue isn't in your department, and you can just alert your superior of it and pass on to other things. Whatever the case, there should be an official position on it. Request that it be made official if at all possible. 2. What should be done in this situation? Mention that this is an issue, and ask him / her what (s)he recommends you do in this situation. Should you work out a different way to work hours? Should you send an official warning that this behaviour is not acceptable? Should you leave it totally in the hands of your superior? 

(as I noted above) she may be from a different culture / generation and is unaware of the unwritten local norms she may have a pressure on her to finish tasks asap she may feel the meeting is unproductive and is wasting her time she may be the single expert on her field, and is constantly in demand 

I also realized a deeper concern: the OP is asking about how to treat a symptom (report is not behaving on meetings), while it would be worth digging into the root cause(s) instead. There can be many reasons for her behaviour, including
