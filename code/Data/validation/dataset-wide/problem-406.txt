You need a new package. I'll assume that, because your customers can interact with the outside world via email, your simulations run in real-time - or at-least mimic it? We were in a similar situation to you last quarter (competitor here, willing to help). Most customers really did just empty their investments, savings, pensions and the like, just to get 50 odd years. But 50 years in a computer doesn't have to be 50 years real-time. Sure, some customers will want to match UTC. But others are really not too bothered and would rather max-out their time in the box. So we started offering just that. You can live 1000+ years in our Velox boxes. They just simulate faster. Meaning the customer gets more time and we run with less costs. Approximately 333.334 years in represents 365 days out. We noticed our sales shot right up. People simply want to live longer. This also opened up our platform to customers who or are still "alive". They can extend their life intermittently, if they really want. Dip into one of our boxes, for a few minutes, and get a few days to spend. Most tend to visit their "deceased" loved ones, others just want to experience something new. We know, a competitor. Why would we offer such advice? Well, we're already working on something new - so you get this one for free :) 

If enough supplies are sent, they can stiff the crew and just let them die in orbit. If those supplies aren't enough... well, more strife, as they say, must be stirred: 

Over the generations, this sort of phobia – where the crew is concerned with even being close to a gravity well – would turn into almost a religion. An ark ship travelling for generations could develop its own lore, traditions, and faith... meaning that arriving at the planet would be Armageddon, and the colonists would be the anti-christ(s). The (prophesied?) Captain, in turn, would be a sort of Messiah, or, at the least, the Pope. The colonists, then, must break this unified front into smaller groups. Fanatics are obsessed with purity. It's not enough to know who is opposed to gravity – everyone is – you need to know how tainted people are by gravity. How many people have passed through the parts of the ship that were able simulate gravity? Whose ancestors used those gravity simulators? Whose ancestors boarded the ship last (and were in a gravity well longer than others)? Alternatively, genetic enhancements probably were unevenly expressed – so who shows signs of muscle loss, weak bones, etc? Purity becomes paramount, hereditary even, and potential traitors are everywhere. The colonists can play on these tendencies. First, they should broadcast a series of pleas from families desperate for supplies – begging, please won't you send us the food/medicine/technology we need to live? Make the stories as sob inducing as possible – really ham it up. Next, broadcast a message (ostensibly addressed to the captain) saying: 

I would like to add that given 25 years, until their abilities develop - putting them on the frontline or in some type of fighting position just doesn't make sense, they're too valuable. 

Carving. Take the ancient Jordanian city of Petra, for example. They put giant steps into a mountain so that they could test the quality of the rock. The benefit to building steps was so that nobody would have to hang by ropes or dangle off the mountain - during the build process. It was this technique that enabled the constructors to stand on secure ledges while they literally carved around the mountain rock. That being said, I'll assume your builders don't have hundreds of years to commit with a hammer and chisel. So you might want to pack some impressive technology. 

Containers. Simply build the island upon containers that have the ability to act has weights or floats. In other words, containers utilise valves which can either let water in, or out. When water is let in, the island sinks. When dispensed and replaced with some type of (light) gas, such as helium, the island floats. 

As you can imagine, the message sends the zealots and high priests into a frenzy. Cries of 'HERETIC!' echo down the ships halls, neighbors rat out neighbors, minor scuffles break out ship-wide... The crew would review who tuned in to the sappy pleas from the colonists, and soon the saintly Captain (betrayed by his people's the lack of faith), must, with a heavy heart, sentence these sinners to the ultimate punishment: being sent down to the planet. How do the colonists convince the crew to send supplies with the sinners? Offer the ship an out. The ship's problem is twofold: they can't escape orbit because they can't set destinations, and they can't go on forever because they don't have fuel. The colonists probably don't have the answer to either of those problems... but the crew doesn't know that. The colonists can just lie: 

I see an interesting way of dealing with this (other than the excellent answers so far!). If the supply ships arrive all at once it would change the answer a bit, but it seems like the question asker and many answers here assume that it's not a simultaneous thing. The OP states: 

Message transmitters. Having heightened senses would be great for a spying role, but you're not wrong in mentioning their flames and long tails could give away positioning. So why not make use of that visibility? I would propose assigning them as message carriers. I assume they're energetic and fast? Why not have them physically travel between base camps, spreading vital war tactics. Their impressive agility would allow them to trek efficiently. Don't want to have them travel vast distances? Let's not forget about their magic. Flickering on and off their flames could represent visual transmission, similar to Morse Code. They could act as look outs and notify allies when dangers are spotted. Their super hearing and vision could also help leak encrypted, enemy, information. Perhaps they could utilise their magic in the form of code breaking? Medieval and Renaissance cryptography did exist and deciphering that kind of data could often be the key to winning a war. 

If you're sceptical about the data processing costs, don't fear. Our state of the art compression techniques are utilised through cryptography. Unlawful patterns are matched in the computers RAM, in which pulls learned formulas from a secured data centre. I'll quote you on $200,000 a year. I know, a slight increase in comparison with what you expected, but you'll need to configure your long game. Let's not forget about all of your other expenses.
