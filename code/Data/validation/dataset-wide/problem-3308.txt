In my opinon, English heteronymy is not the same thing. English words are not a single sign; each word is made up of multiple signs (letters) and even heteronyms have a phonetic basis for their pronunciation. A better comparison might be Chinese languages though. Chinese characters include about 800 polyphonic characters which can make up 25% of a typical corpus by frequency. Their existence has quite obviously not been a "major fail" for Chinese characters, as evidenced by their daily use by billions of people. 

Verhoef & de Boer in "Language acquisition age effects and their role in the preservation and change of communication systems" found that, if anything, language learning by children tends to help resist language change: 

(I.e., in Porteño Spanish, "MARÍA compró el diario" and "compró el diario MARÍA" were both found, while in Patagonian Spanish, "compró el diario MARÍA" was never found.) Of course this is limited to two Argentinian dialects, but it shows there is dialectal variation of focusing strategies. Interestingly it is also a bit different than what you say are Zubizaretta's original results. In your example above you say that [FS]VO was infelicitous to Zubizaretta; but your South American friend found the opposite, in accord with Gabriel's results. So that may be yet another dialectal variation; I don't have access to Zubizaretta's book to know. Also: Gabriel says that contrastive focus is treated differently than informational focus, and that phonetic stress is as important as movement for focusing constituents. Your examples above exhibit informational focus. 

Being the earliest area to split off from the Empire, in 271 AD - leading to loss of stabilizing linguistic influence from Rome Geographical and later social separation from the other Romance languages, leading to less influence by and fewer borrowings from Germanic. E.g. 'white', instead of coming from Germanic blank, is alb from Latin albus The Balkan Sprachbund shared with Slavic, Greek, and Albanian. The Sprachbund had a significant influence on both grammar and, to a lesser extent, lexicon. The influence of the Paleo-balkan substratum which is not inconsiderable - some scholars report up to 500 roots may be inherited from Dacian 

In reading a paper by Anand & Hacquard, I've come across the term "witness world," where a witness world can verify a proposition, p. I haven't been able to google an easily understandable definition of a "witness world," (although this is probably due to poor detective work on my part). This leads to my question: What is a witness world (i.e., how is it defined), and how does it do this business of verifying propositions? The closest thing that comes to my mind are witness sets, which, as I understand them, are the characteristic sets of generalised quantifiers, except that unlike characteristic sets for a GQ like [Q NP], which may have non-NP entities as members, witness sets only contain NP-entities. Szabolcsi (2010)'s example is "more than one robot," where a characteristic set includes non-robots (i.e., any set that has more than one robot), but a witness set is constrained so that it only contains robots. I figured I could construct a sort of parallel, where a world would be a set of pairs, so a "witness world" would be a set of these pairs (for a modal, or attitude predicate), but these pairs are somehow restricted by the prejacent or embedded clause's assignment. But I wasn't sure how to proceed here (or whether I even should, in case there is no parallel, or I was going about the parallel in the wrong way). Which is my second related question - is the notion of "witness world" related to the notion of a "witness set," and if so, how? 

They also observe that the "causer" reading is not possible with unaccusative verbs. (This relates to your observation that there is an agentivity requirement.). So all unaccusative verbs in the "have" construction will be interpreted as introducing an "affected" argument. (Or be unacceptable). 

As I understood their analysis, they aimed to account for this fact by arguing that "have" can only extend event structure, not introduce new event structure. And because unaccusatives don't underlying have causation/agentivity, "have" in an unaccusative construction can only extend the event's endpoint, so the introduced argument must be interpreted as the experiencer/affectee. (I don't know if this quite gels with your observations about awareness. Except maybe that "ignorance is bliss" and in order to be an experiencer/affectee, you have to know about your misfortune?) As for other languages with similar predicates, they propose that the Japanese adversative -rare is similar to "have," but specified as extending the endpoint (hence the argument is always an experiencer/affectee), and that the French faire is similar to "have" but specified as extending the initial point (hence the argument is always a causer). There are also both benefactive and malefactive interpretations for some Salish applicatives (see, for example, Kiyosawa & Gerdts 2010. Some googling has also resulted in a book "Benefactives and malefactives: Typological perspectives and case studies" by Zuniga and Zeppo (2010). That might give you a good place to look for the crosslinguistic morphosyntactic properties of malefactives. Sorry I've got nothing on the diachronic question. Totally not my forté. Sorry also that I haven't read the later article by Ritter & Rosen (1997) - I'm not sure if they stick with their 1993 analysis, or change it. Some References: Ritter, E., & Rosen, S. T. (1993).

There were other periods of rapid language changes in Western Europe besides the Renaissance. "Faster" is hard to measure. First, I think you need to specify your point of comparison. There have only been about 300 years since the end of the Renaissance. Of course people have lived in Western Europe for at least 40,000 years, but for this question I suppose we should limit our scope to Indoeuropean languages. IE speakers were certainly in Western Europe by the second millennium BC, 4000 years ago. So did the languages of Western Europe change at a greater rate during 1400-1700 than at any other 300 year period from 2000 BC- present? We just don't have evidence for most of that period. So let me suggest: what about the rise of the Romance languages from Vulgar Latin? That happened sometime between the breakup of the Roman Empire and the 9th century. Langue d'oïl is known since the 9th century, Old Spanish since the 10th, and Common Romanian since the 9th. I don't know how you propose to compare the rate of change. I would certainly say, though, that the rise of the Romance languages within 400 years is as significant as the changes due to the Renaissance. EDIT: Since you mention English above: Middle English arose out of Anglo-Saxon starting in 1066 and the transition was rather abrupt, complete by about 1154, the time of the Plantegenets. Invasions have long been a mechanism for rapid language change. 

Using a noun phrase without a determiner is already fairly common in certain registers of English -- notably newspaperese. I think that there you're also more likely to find formal-souding words like said used. The OED Online gives said simply as an adjective (ignoring irrelevant senses) meaning "named or mentioned before". In the examples they give, said is always used with a preceding determiner. So I think it's consistent with both of the above to say that: (1) said is just an adjective in this case and (2) some registers of English allow NPs to occur without Dets more frequently. thus leading to NPs like "said children". 

Mereological theories of events usually assume that the domain of events forms a join semilattice with no bottom element.(Landman 2004's "Indefinites and the Type of Sets" is one of the few exceptions I've found.) There are probably good reasons that most researchers assume that there is no bottom element - i.e., I assume that there are negative consequences to assuming a bottom element, and that these have been discussed somewhere in the literature. What are some of these negative consequences? (Or where could I find a discussion of some of them?) 

I can try and provide an answer for questions 1 & 3, based on Ritter & Rosen 1993's paper "Deriving Causation." The answer to 1 is more syntax-semantics interface than semantics though (given that Ritter & Rosen do more syntax-semantics-interface style analyses.) So Ritter & Rosen 1993 argues that "have" is a "functor predicate" which means that (i) it can introduce an argument (like a lexical predicate) but (ii) it lacks lexical semantic content (like a functional predicate), and thus does not encode a particular theta role for the argument it introduces. Rather, the "theta role" of the introduced argument is derived from the event structure that "have" introduces/modifies. This is meant to account for the observation (which you made above) that the argument "have" introduces can sometimes be introduced as a causer, or as an experiencer/affectee. They argue that the introduction of additional arguments to a construction correlates with the introduction of additional event structure to a predicate. So since "have" systematically introduces a new argument, it also systematically introduces more event structure. It is unspecified, however, for what kind of extra event structure it contributes. It can thus be interpreted as extending the event beyond the original starting point of the event - in which case the introduced argument will be interpreted as the causer of the event. Or it can be interpreted as extending the event beyond the original ending point of the event - in which case the introduced argument will be interpreted as the experiencer/affectee of the event. (I tried to schematize this below in a sort of diagram.) 

Onomatopoetic words do undergo sound changes. Sometimes this results in the word no longer being onomatopoetic, in which case new onomatopoeias are often introduced. Hock and Joseph in Language History, Language Change, and Language Relationship give the following examples: 

Older shorthands included the Tironian notes (notae tironianae), Greek tachygraphy (of which not much is known), and various forms of scribal notation (although these were usually purely phonetic in nature). Remnants of these can be found in modern European languages, e.g. and. Finally, there is the Moon System of embossed letters for the blind. In addition to symbols for the English letters, it includes signs for: 

For the front stops, they exhibit the contrasts you mention (in addition to a plain voiced manner). EDIT: The inventory above is not atypical of North American languages, for example Kiowa also contrasts voiced/voiceless/aspirated/ejective. And many of Africa's !Kung languages exhibit extensive contrasting manners of articulation among the stops; Ekoka contrasts up to 5 manners at each point of articulation, and that's not including clicks. It's not clear if this is the kind of thing you're asking about, though. 

Yes, it did. hen: From Middle English henne, heonne, hinne, from earlier henene, heonenen, henen, from Old English heonan, hionan, heonane, heonone (“hence, from here, away, from how”), from Proto-Germanic *hina, *hinanō (“from here”), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱe-, *ḱey- (“this, here”). Cognate with Dutch heen (“away”), German hin (“hence, from here”), Danish hen (“away, further, on”). See also hence. (dialectal) Hence. EDITED TO ADD: To be sure, this answer addresses the "Whatever happened to "hen?" Did that form exist in an earlier stage or dialect?" part of your question. hen did not really mean 'now'. 

Interestingly, Portuguese has just about the same number of phonemic diphthongs as Spanish, but in Portuguese they are all falling diphthongs (these are EP): (falling) (falling) While in Spanish we find both kinds: ` (falling) (falling) (rising) (rising) But perhaps diphthongs are more 'noticeable' in Spanish because of the active sound change that jogloran describes in his answer (vowel breaking). In Spanish there are verb conjugations like:
