Months Christians have put quite a bit of effort into getting the date of Easter right (though denominations disagree on what "right" is), so any calendar reform is going to have to preserve that. There are two competing goals here: getting the right date, and getting it to fall on a Sunday. These goals are incompatible most of the time, hence the computations involving full moons and equinoxes. Even while keeping the Sunday goal, the church could have made their calculations easier by saying "first Sunday after 14 (or 15) Nisan", the date on the Hebrew calendar on which the historical event is said to have occurred. Instead, though, the rule is based on the first full moon after the vernal equinox. Why not follow the Hebrew calendar? I suspect, from the centuries of animosity toward and persecution of Jews by the church, that the church was unwilling to rely on the Jewish calendar to fix their dates. Unless that aspect of the church has changed in your alternate history, we should therefore assume that the Christian calendar will continue to avoid using the Hebrew calendar as a basis. But you still need months, because the bible talks about new moons as significant days. I think it plausible that a new Christian calendar would develop its own lunar calendar. There are at least two examples to look at, the Hebrew calendar and the Muslim calendar -- the difference tween the two is that the former uses leap-months to keep special days in their proper seasons (a solar-adjusted lunar calendar), while the latter is purely lunar. As far as I understand, Christianity has only two important dates that need to stay in their proper seasons, so they could adopt a pure-lunar calendar with the seasons of Easter and Christmas fixed, rather than their months. Or they could implement something similar to the Hebrew calendar, but they'd call it something different. If you don't care about the month names for the holidays -- if Easter doesn't have to be in "April" or "Nisan" but just needs to be in the northern spring -- then you are free to have any number of months you want, though to approximately align them with the year you'll need 12 or 13. What would they name them? One possibility is "first month", "second month", etc, particularly if those turn into single words in Latin or Greek. "First month" should probably be the month containing Easter, since that's the transformative event of Christianity. Another possibility is to name the months after the disciples. (I think that more likely than naming after the tribes of Israel, a connection that Christianity might want to downplay.) If you include Judas's replacement, you can even get up to 13, for those years when you need a 13th month. (Maybe the leap-moth is Judas, so doesn't show up as much.) If we're naming months after disciples, shouldn't we name one after their teacher/leader, Jesus? To some Christians using the name of their savior in casual conversations ("your dentist appointment is on Jesus 12th") would seem inappropriate, even blasphemous, so I expect they would avoid doing so. Days The seven-day week is fundamental to Christianity, based on the seven days of creation at the beginning of Genesis. We have a problem here, though; the seven days of creation culminate with the sabbath, Saturday, while Christianity's special day is Sunday, the "lord's day". (I'm not a church historian, but I've read that they originally celebrated the sabbath on Saturday, as do Jews, but then moved the focus to Sunday to distinguish their community. Plus, maybe that Easter thing.) So they probably aren't going to want a close naming tie to the days of creation, because that makes the most-important day Saturday. If your alternate history doesn't have Jews still around (or Seventh-Day Adventists), you could shift everything a day -- declare Sunday to be the sabbath and the last day of creation, and most people won't know any differently. But if you can't just rename the sabbath, you could go looking for a different set of seven to use as week names. I suggest you name the days after the seven cardinal virtues, to keep Christian values front and center every day. (You could also consider Paul's seven spiritual gifts, but I don't think they're as widely known.) Example Putting these ideas together, here is one possible calendar. (I don't know the significance of most of those disciples, so I haven't attempted a complete ordering.) Days of the week: 

I'm going to refine the "study other languages" suggestion in many of these answers: study one other language and learn how it works. Your language will sound more plausible if you didn't take "one from column A, one from column B" when considering word order, conjugation, declension, aspect, and so on. But on the other hand, since most of your readers probably won't know the language you chose, you can copy elements and still seem "foreign". Pick a (non-Romance) language and look for a grammar that explains it. (If you're weak on formal grammar you'll want to work on that first.) If you get lucky you'll find a book that explains how the grammar works as compared to English; I found such a book when studying Hebrew. You don't actually need to learn a lot of vocabulary; after all, you're going to make your own. But learning a little will help you understand the grammatical principles of that language. If you're not a linguist or already multi-lingual, I would stop here and construct a language modelled on your exemplar. Yes, it'll be (say) Bulgarian with the serial numbers filed off, but you won't have to invent every aspect of the language yourself. If you need to adapt the language because, say, your aliens have three genders and your language is gendered, then go ahead and so something that feels consistent to you. As you work more with your invented language you'll probably get more comfortable with making minor tweaks. You probably don't want to completely change how you, say, construct prepositional phrases, but you can (a) introduce minor variations (in English there are lots of ways to say the same thing; why not in your language too?) and (b) build out stuff that you didn't do much with initially. 

I live in Pennsylvania. Let me answer this from local experience. No, the church doesn't control alcohol here, but the state Liquor Control Board does. Your question has two parts: how a body gains control initially, and how it holds onto this power. (You didn't actually ask the second part, but it's relevant.) Governments sometimes prohibit or restrict material that they consider dangerous. In the US, alcohol was prohibited entirely for a time by constitutional amendment, which means a large number of people with political power decided the matter. Then later, a large number of people with political power said "never mind", but even though it was no longer prohibited, it remained regulated. Some drugs are similarly prohibited (e.g. narcotics) and others regulated (e.g. marijuana, in some jurisdictions). Other matters of personal consumption are also regulated (e.g. tobacco). In your world, your government needs to decide (and popularize the idea) that alcohol is dangerous in some way and needs to be regulated. It can then entrust this regulation to the church (who probably lobbied for regulation in the first place, either secretly or openly). Your church should be broadly seen as doing good work and being deserving of the trust. (The PA liquor control board didn't need to meet this requirement because it's an arm of the government, but an outside body would.) Once they have control, how do they retain it? Political scheming can work, but popular support works better. In PA a lot of this comes from labor unions (who staff the stores); in your world the church will need popular support, like being the dominant religion. Your church, like the LCB, will make sure that there is widespread education about the dangers of alcohol. It might facilitate groups like Mothers Against Drunk Riding (sounds like you might have horses rather than cars). The church will ensure that people's alcohol needs are being met, that people can buy (perhaps-limited) amounts for their festivities. So long as people see that drinking isn't getting out of hand, but they can still get wine for celebrations, they'll leave well-enough alone. 

Centaurs are horse-human hybrids. Because they have human elements, we can assume that they have intelligence, culture, and a desire for a comfortable life. A stable that would be good enough for a mere horse just isn't going to cut it. So what would a comfortable residence for a centaur look like? Some considerations that would seem to apply: 

Recent news reported the discovery of three "earth-like" planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. This is interesting because the star is a small, cool red dwarf about the size of Jupiter. The three planets in the habitable zone are tidally locked and about the size of Earth, could have atmospheres, and receive 2 to 4 times the radiation that Earth receives from Sol. (More from the TRAPPIST-1 site.) Assuming, for the sake of this question, that both atmosphere and water are present, how advanced are native life forms likely to get? Is the development of animal life plausible? If so, what type? The combination of high radiation and dim light (especially if only the twilight band is viable because of the tidal lock) does not sound especially conducive to animal life to me, but I am not an expert. 

I'm not saying you should do all those things; those are just suggestions. You could, of course, make up whole new stories that fit your theme. Once you have the baseline narrative, you can then adjust prophetic messages, legends, and history to fit. 

I would like to have Earth slowly move away from the sun, taking somewhere between several months and a couple of years to reach the point where human life on the surface is no longer possible. (The story revolves around efforts to get protected in time and the resulting conflicts. So yes, we have some level of spaceflight, but not FTL -- the people who get out will be taking their chances on something like generation ships. Or, as pointed out in the comments, by building shelters on earth to give them longer to come up with a permanent solution.) My problem is that I don't know what could cause this. I can think of ways to knock the earth out of its orbit quickly that involve killing most or all of the inhabitants, but I need something that leaves many people alive and gives them time to stew about what's next. I want them to be slowly freezing, not slowly cooking -- moving away from, not falling into, the sun. Is this possible? If so how? It's ok to vaporize a region if that's needed. I'm not fussy about which people survive, only that many do.
