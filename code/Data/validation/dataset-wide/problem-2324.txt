At UK airports you are not allowed to take them into the cabin. They must be in the hold. You wont get them through security and they confiscate them, whatever airline you are on. 

Water proof spray would only help with the outside of the bag. Waterproofing is available that the bag is washed in which coats all the down with hydrophobic water repellant. Or ready made ones are also available. $URL$ 

Volcanic water is not a problem. Volvic is a popular spring water in France it filters through an extinct volcano. Of course any water could have nasty chemicals in it. Filtering through a garment will not remove chemicals nor will boiling the water. You should ask locals about the water quality or look for springs that have man made constructions such as a basin and a pipe. 

These laws are often to stop homeless people hanging around. In England the vagrancy act has not been repealed and the police still arbitrarily arrest people for being vagrant. So even sleeping rough without a tent is illegal. In other places they just want to extract as much money from tourists as possible and to make them use official facilities. In Scotland wild camping is allowed. Pedestrians can also camp near roads. Car drivers have to walk away. There are limits around Loch Lomond due to tourists leaving rubbish. 

If you're not having fun, figure out why and fix it for next time. As you gain experience things will become easier and you'll have more fun. 

lower air density which increases respiration and, therefore, water loss, and lower air pressure which increases evaporation of moisture from the skin. 

Safety equipment for each sport is designed, tested and certified specifically for that sport. Different sports have different and often competing priorities for the type of protection and comfort required. An example of competing priorities might be that climbing helmets need to provide extra protection at the top of the head to defend against falling rock, whereas, cycling helmets are designed to provide additional ventilation for comfort. In short, climbing helmets are not suitable for cycling and cycling helmets are not suitable for climbing. Wear the correct safety equipment for the activity you are taking part in. 

As Cryptosporidium is passed in the faeces of animals, the more heavily the land is used by animals, the greater the risk of Cryptosporidium contamination in water sourced from that land. This article suggests some ways (quoted below) to avoid Giardia (which has a similar lifecycle to Cryptosporidium), conversely, if you are unable to source water following these guidlines the greater risk of Cryptosporidium contamination. 

The key advantage of a geodesic design is the pole configuration can support a greater static load. This means they are favoured for mountaineering expeditions because they can withstand a heavy snow fall (compared with a tunnel design that would sag with the weight of the snow between each pole). Tunnel tents are preferred for polar expeditions as they generally have a better weight to space ratio (the walls are more "vertical" than an equivalent geodesic design), they are simpler and quicker to pitch and as many regions of the Poles have little precipitation (some areas being classified as desert) the ability to withstand heavy snowfall is much less of a consideration. 

Wild camping is allowed most places but due to car drivers leaving rubbish it's not allowed near the road at Loch Lomond in summer. Wishingwell Farmhouse campsite, Gartness and Drymen Farm campsite are both closed.(according to Google Maps) Shops at Balmaha, Loch Lomond. There are a few campsites besides Loch Lomond. Salachy Campsite is £5 which is the cheapest. But the campsite just before it is £7 and has much better facilities, including showers. Rowchoish Bothy - good bothy worth using. Doune Bothy - very poor condition, full of trash, don't use. Beinglas Farm is a good campsite with a restaurant with food and beer. At Tyndrum is a shop. Check the prices when buying, especially the fruit. Make sure you get a receipt. There is a small shop at the Strathfillan Wigwams Campsite. I bought a snack there (but didn't stay). There is a permitted wild camping on the north side of the bridge at the Bridge of Orchy but being near the road had noisy people. The Hotel has a restaurant and bar. The route passes the Inveroran Hotel, food and beer. Wild camping. Free camping at the Kingshouse Hotel. With beer and restaurant. 

Porridge is good for breakfast. The small packets of "golden syrup flavour" are the best, but a bit more expensive than regular porridge. (N.B. The more powdery it is the faster it cooks.) Carbs: rice/pasta/ cous cous (I like "Moroccan medley", "tomato & chilli"). [aluminium bubble foil: DIY shops sell this in the insulation dept. Use this to make a wrapper for your pan. Once that water is boiled, the rice/pasta etc put in and the brought to boiling again, the heat can be turned off and the pan put in the insulating wrapper. The stored heat will be enough to cook the rice/pasta. [For larger paster shaped eg spirals the water can be left till it's cold then re-heated] Saves weight. For long hikes I use a petrol stove because it is easier to find petrol supplies.] For faster pasta cooking use the very thin pasta (UK vermicelli, FR cheveux d'ange) When cooking pasta there is no need to use a lot of water. When cooked, instant soup can be added (eg "East Indian mulligatawny", "Italian minestrone"), or tinned fish (sardines), or tinned meat (bully beef). For all these for extra flavour squirt in some olive oil (high carbs) (transfer a glass bottle's oil to a plastic bottle), especially good with cous cous. Lumps of cheese can also be added and mixed in. Some butter is also good but melts easily in warm weather. (margarine is high in water and emulsifiers, it is not high in calories). Do not throw away any hot water. Soak it up with instant mash. (Instant mash comes in two forms: 1) flakes added to water 2) lumps where the water is added to the lumps. You need (1) as you can add as many as needed to get it solid.) Protein: tinned sardines, bully beef, soya ("wholefood soya mince" cooks a lot faster than the lumps). All sorts of dried meats and sausages on the continent. And cheese, harder varieties keep best. If you can get eggs along the way these can be cooked by mixing the egg into the boiling water with the pasta etc. Dried fruits, usually raisins, for flavoursome snacks. Biscuits, eg custard creams, and chocolate are also good snacks. On shorter hikes I also take fresh fruit, apples. After a meal I like a cup of tea. With lots of sugar. This can be made in the same pan used above without washing. The tea gathers up the bits and cleans the pan. ps If you prefer real coffee this can also be made in an ordinary pan if you don't mind a few coffee grains in the last couple of sips. 

Me and my partner will be spending a week in February in the Lake District, UK (Monday to Friday). We want to get as much walking in as possible and attempt a number of the peaks / ridges. We are very aware that we will find heavy snow and cold temperatures and that crampons / ice axes are recommended for that time of year. Neither of us have experience of using crampons and ice axes. We've had a look at the local centers who offer courses, and they all offer 2 day courses where they show you how to use the equipment and how to stay safe. However all the courses run at weekends. Does anybody know of a mid-week course? Or alternatively, does anybody know of a good guide we could hire for a few days to guide us on some of the hikes and show us the techniques along the way? 

If you are only going to use them to cross rivers and you are wanting to save on weight / space, I would suggest some neoprene booties. Surf or diving booties will do just fine. Some are like a neoprene sock, you will get a hole in these fairly quickly. Some are more substantial and are like a neoprene sock with a rubber sole. I would suggest you get a pair of these. They weigh very little and will easily survive walking over slippery wet rocks. You can also pick them up for well under £20 from any surf shop or online retailer. Try somewhere like decathlon or go outdoors or just do a goole search for surf booties. There are plently of online retailers selling them.
