At the very least the option (for men: taking an additional wife; for women: "upgrading") improves their negotiating power in marriage. Note that polygamy leaves many "generic" men without a mate (and without even a hope of getting one) which puts them in a desperate position (leading to very risky behavior). Historical perspective A promise of enforcing monogamy gives hope to the mass of "generic" males and thus is an extremely profitable move for any revolutionary in a polygamous society. Observe that both Jesus and Muhammad used this move: Christianity outlawed polygamy completely, while Islam limited the number of wives to 4 and gave the promise of conquered women to the mujaheddin (jihad participants). Current situation What really matters is not the legality of polygamy, but its availability. If a "desirable" man can have an "official" mistress and no one bats an eye, then the society can be considered to be de facto polygamous. I would expect more correlation between the spread of polygamy (measured by, e.g., Gini index of number of women / men or the entropy of the distribution) and the violent crime rate (which is mostly perpetrated by males), because, as I already mentioned, men without a hope for a mate tend to engage in extremely risky behavior in the off-chance of radically changing their status. The crime rate, however, can be moderated by an oppressive government or given an outlet in military adventures, so the formula would be something like 

I don't think we can get an exact answer, but we can at least set some parameters and make a reasonable guess. First, This light bulb in Livermore, California has been burning since 1901. It's been off for a few brief periods since then, but the point is to demonstrate that early filament bulbs lasted a long time and were left on. The first electric arc street lighting was installed in Los Angeles in 1876 and in London and Paris in 1878. These were likely turned off during the day. Now, we go back to the time just after Edison perfected his incandescent light bulb. The Menlo Park Museum website has this to say: 

Thus, in theory, Ukraine can claim that, unless US and UK protect it from the Russian aggression, it has the right to re-acquire nuclear weapons (but not claim a share in UNSC membership). In practice, Ukraine acquiring nukes will be counterproductive, as they will not nuke Moscow anyway and just chill their relationships with the West, while giving a pretext to Russia to invade in earnest. 

It appears that there are about a 100 currently unidentified murder victims in the US (that the wikipedia editors bothers to collect). Given that there are ~ 15k homicides in the US annually, I don't think there is much statistical significance here: it is rare for a victim to remain unidentified and it is very rare for such a crime to be solved. 

Aquileia is at the head of the Adriatic, but on the mainland, and closer to Trieste than Venice. Actually, Attilla's next target was Padua, but in 452 Pope Leo I somehow persuaded him to stop. Recall that the islands in the Veneto were settled by by people fleeing the various Gothic, Hunnic, and Lombard invasions near the end of the Western Roman Empire. Attilla was likely more interested in richer prizes (such as Rome) than pursuing a few soggy refugees into a swamp. 

(apologies for my attempts to transcribe the handwriting) Even better, an 1803 campaign broadsheet, "To the Independent Republican Citizens of the County of Philadelphia." (reproduced at the Library of Congress) has: 

Stalin was an ideologue, but not a very rigid one, and he was not an idiot. He supported Israel because it was a thorn in the side of the British Empire (and its Arab relationships), not because the Zionists were left wing. After all, left wing or right wing, anyone who did not toe the Moscow's line precisely was an enemy (cf Tito-Stalin Split). Stalin knew full well that people neither join the communist camp nor enter the prison camp voluntarily, and did not expect Israel to do so; and he did not have the resources to turn Israel into another Poland or Romania. 

Political parties inevitably appear for one simple mathematical reason: Shapley value is superadditive. IOW, the power of a coalition is more than the sum of powers of its members. Example: suppose we have a parliament of 3 members. Each has power (Shapley value) of 1/3 (because of symmetry). If two of them form a "party" (i.e., always vote as a block), then they always win and the power of the party is 1 while the power of the third MP is 0. Thus, by joining forces, each of the two party MPs increased their power by 50% (from 1/3 to 1/2). This means that whenever a parliament is formed, its members will start aligning into political parties to increase their personal power. 

My reasoned guess is that this moment in 1882 is your answer. Although an 1890 fire put the Pearl Street generating station out of commission for 11 days, it is likely that one of the buildings on Pearl Street had at least one light bulb on the whole time it was in service. In the meantime, of course, the use of electric lighting spread rapidly (in 1888, Tamworth NSW was the first town in Australia with electric street lighting), reducing the chance of a completely electrically-unilluminated Earth as time passed, until the Livermore bulb first turned on in 1901. 

To think outside the Matryoshka dolls for a second, Stanisław August Poniatowski was allegedly a lover of Catherine between 1755-1758 (and the father of her daugher Anna), and was placed on the throne of Poland in 1764. Although the Sejm voted him in, Russia was essentially in control of Poland at the time and they voted Catherine's candidate in. (They'd had to do it before in 1736 for Augustus III under Empress Anna). So although Poniatowski had to do Catherine's bidding, such as standing by while his country was dismembered, as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, he nominally outranked any of his Russian counterparts. 

T-34 was evaluated at Aberdeen, by the Germans, Finns, &c, and one of the common major complaints was poor visibility: 

Yes, until, more or less, mid 1950-ies (of course, the physical presence of Stalin in the room was irrelevant). It was not a "required code of behavior" (cf. grace after meal) and varied in time/space/status of the place (e.g., more likely in late 1930-ies, elite childcare in Moscow, less likely in late 1940-ies poor school in Siberia). However, if an adult (e.g., teacher or party functionary) prompted it, the refusal to comply would definitely have disastrous effects for the child and his/her family. The phrase "спасибо товарищу Сталину за наше счастливое детство" (thanks to comrade Stalin for our happy childhood) was a meme that even I knew as I grew up in 1970-ies. It was not said in earnest then, but more as a historical reference. 

Yes, they did (that is, the quoted assertion is not true) Some members of this party indeed called themselves "Democratic-Republicans", although not consistently. The Wikipedia article for this party states (in its main text) what I was taught in grade school, namely that the party was called "Republican" during the period it was in existence. Yet further along, they walk it back: 

Because people are quibbling in comments over the meaning of "overpopulation", it might suggest that this question is broad or unclear. So let's look at it from a different angle. In the 1960's, Dr. John Calhoun, working at NIH, conducted his famous (some would say infamous) "mouse utopia experiment". Mice were placed in an enclosure (named "Universe 25") where they were provided with an unlimited supply of food and water. The only constraint was the size of enclosure. For a while, the mouse population exploded, as one might expect. After a while the population leveled off, and in the crowded conditions, several peculiar patterns of behavior emerged. For example, there were gangs of unattached male mice who would get into violent fights with , and individuals that Calhoun dubbed "the beautiful ones" who would do nothing but eat, groom, and sleep. Eventually, all of the mice just went about their business, ignoring each other as if they were on their phones all the time, and the population plummeted. In fact, none of the mice survived despite having unlimited resources. The devolution of the mice's social behavior (called a "behavioral sink" by Calhoun), and only that, led to their extinction. Other researchers produced similar results using rats. It isn't clear how well this experiment applies to human behavior, and Calhoun's methodology has been criticized, but it is a good example of the effects of overcrowding that we should think about. 

They require fairly specific combinations of circumstances which probably never arose together, e.g., a nobleman marrying a low-born girl (instead of taking her as a mistress) for religious reasons requires that he has high religious conformance but low social conformance. PS. The above assumes "established feudalism". All royalty and nobility stems from warlords and their warriors and originally the boundary between high-born and low-born was relatively fluid. PPS. Another aspect is the level of stratification. No duke has ever married a commoner, but many squires did. 

The most common answer ("accepted narrative") to this question would be the Soviet Ambassador in Washington Nikolai Novikov's telegram of September 1946. However, given the traditional and consistent Russian/Soviet mistrust of the West, it can hardly be viewed as a "milestone" similar to The Long Telegram. Rather than shape and direct policy, it merely helped reinforce the existing position and alert Moscow to the Washington's awakening to Moscow's attitudes. Suffice it to observe that USSR suppressed democratic opposition to communism in Eastern Europe from the get go, even before the VE day. 

Wikipedia sources this from the website for the 1st Infantry Division Band, which indicates this happened on the notorious "Thunder Road" between Saigon and Quan Loi, but the description on the band's website does not date the incident. Mother Jones says this happened in March, 1969. There is also a list of campaigns the band served in.The last campaign listed is the first Gulf War in 1991.However, none of the others have any description of combat, so this incident during the Vietnam War was probably the last time for them. 

It's unlikely that the lights on Christie Street stayed on all the time; it's a bit more likely that the lights in the Menlo Park lab were always on. In 1880 Moseley street in Newcastle was lit by J.W. Swan's independently-developed incandescent lamps. Edison and Swan soon began selling lighting systems to early adopters, wealthy individuals who lit their mansions as status symbols. So the chances of some light somewhere being on all the time increased. And then came the summer of 1882:
