Are the commentaries of Averroes, in Latin or English translation, available online? If there are none available online, what are some editions of Averroes in Latin or English? The closest I've been able to find is this, but they are very hard-to-read and old editions. Are there OCRed or recently-published editions available? 

Disputations could be thought of as a public, open, oral form of peer review because they laid out all the arguments for and against a particular thesis, distilling out the truth. Also, European universities were under the control of the Catholic Church, which had ultimate say what was taught at the universities, what textbooks could be used, etc. See, e.g., the Condemnations of 1277, which liberated the universities from intransigent Aristotelianism. 

Józef Maria Bocheński, O.P.'s 1959 A Precis of Mathematical Logic defines "mathematical logic" this way on p. 1: 

Parmenides's is certainly the best because it is based on solid principles like that of non-contradiction* and that something cannot come from nothing†.*It is impossible that the same thing be and not be at the same time and in the same respect. †Ex nihilo nihil fit. His arguments are summarized in ch. 5 "Article One: Potency Really Distinct From Act" of Reality: A Synthesis of Thomistic Thought by Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange, O.P.: 

Of course every object has a property, that of being an object. In the absence of the OP stating what is meant by an object or a property, no other answer is possible. But it's clear that when it comes to abstract objects, at least, it's not necessarily the case that every object has a property that uniquely characterizes the object. The real numbers form an uncountable set; but if by property you mean a finite-length string over a finite or countably infinite alphabet, there can be only countably many properties. Therefore almost all real numbers have no property that applies to that number and no other. 

We want to show that (E v C) is true. Now, suppose E is true. Then we're done So, suppose E is false. Since D > E, D must be false. Since B v D is true and D is false, B must be true. Since B is true, ~B is false. Since ~A > ~B and ~B is false, ~A must be false and A must be true. Since A > C and A is true, C must be true. So either E is true, or else C is. QED. Or as I learned in a MOOC with a lot of French students, CQFD, ce qu'il fallait démontrer. 

Λόγος is frequently translated as ratio in Latin, and they both have a much broader extension than translations of them do in English. In philosophy, ratio can mean "reason," "nature," "concept," "aspect," "argument," etc. 

The question of the division of the sciences has a long history. Aristotle, Boethius (d. ca. 525 A.D.), et al. divided philosophy as follows (cf. St. Thomas Aquinas's Division & Methods of the Sciences): 

Aristotle outlined his ten categories in his Categories. Here's an example logical classification (ibid., p. 18): 

And why wouldn't they also need to study meta-"paradox structure theory," meta-meta-"paradox structure theory," meta-meta-meta-"paradox structure theory," … ad infinitum? Thus, you're left with the regress problem, which Aristotle describes in Posterior Analytics I.2: 

Is Einstein's opinion what Kant would also hold? Aristotle, St. Thomas, et el. say that the intellect is superior to the will with its "imagination," "phantasms," or "sense images". Aristotle said the human intellect is in a way everything because it can potentially understand anything. This "intellect" seems to be what Einstein calls "imagination" in his quote. Does saying imagination is more important than knowledge mean that Einstein held Scotus's view that the will is primary and the intellect secondary, subjected to the will? Have any philosophers specifically treated imagination vs. knowledge? 

You're mis-stating Chaos theory. You said: "I understand that chaos theory states that any small event or choice determines the next set of events or actions." But actually you need to say that SOME systems are extremely sensitive to small changes in their starting point. Other systems are stable. So there can be no counterexample. If you have a system that's stable in a region around a point, that's an example of a system that doesn't happen to be chaotic. It's not a violation of chaos theory. That's like saying, Some animals are cats. Can there be a counterexample? A hippopotamus is an animal that's not a cat. But it's not a counterexample to the statement that SOME animals are cats. Some systems are highly sensitive to changes in their input. Some are not. Some systems are chaotic, some are not. And you can't "argue" against chaotic behavior. You can just "do the math," as they say. The points around the boundary of the Mandelbrot set exhibit chaotic behavior. Tiny changes in your starting point produces strikingly different behavior under iteration. That's a fact. You can't argue against it any more than you could argue against trees. 

See this for the rest of this Aristotle quotation, followed by St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on it. 

"Being" requires "oneness" (unity).cf. St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics book X, lesson 3 ("The Nature of Unity"), #1974-1977: A completely random being cannot be one.Primary matter (cf. De Principiis Naturæ) is pure chaos, formlessness; form united with primary matter is what makes something an actual being. ∴, a completely random being cannot be a being. 

See St. Thomas Aquinas's short work The Principles of Nature (De Principiis Naturæ) for an excellent, concise summary of Aristotle's Physics. (cf. also this) 

What you say reminds me of Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy book 5, "Freewill & God's Foreknowledge," where he argues, through the lips of Lady Philosophy, that "nor, indeed, can any creature be rational, unless he be endowed with free will." Boethius discusses this within the context of necessity/determinism and divine foreknowledge, resolving the problem of how God can necessarily foreknow future events but how this foreknowledge does not necessitate such events, thus enabling us to have freewill. He, and St. Thomas Aquinas later, distinguish two types of necessity: absolute(ontological necessity) and hypothetical("necessitas ex suppositione" or "ex finis"). St. Thomas discusses this in In Physica lib. 2 l. 9 and In Posteriora Analytica lib. 2 l. 8. Boethius puts it succinctly: 

All physical measurements in the real world are approximate. To the extent that calculus is used to model physical phenomena, it is an approximation to reality [if one believes in an underlying reality at all ... a separate question.] However, within the scope of mathematics, calculus is exact. That's because calculus is based on a logically rigorous theory of the real numbers, which are based on a logically rigorous account of set theory. That is, we can start from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory, published in the early 1920s, and we can then develop the theory of the real numbers and calculus from those axioms. In that respect, calculus is an exact theory of some imaginary or fictional entities; since (as far as we know) there are no real numbers in the physical universe. So, you are entirely correct that calculus is only an approximation to the real world, whatever that may be. But within the domain of pure mathematics, calculus is exact. That's because the real numbers and sets in general are only abstract mathematical entities. They do not necessarily have any analog in the physical world. 

I found the second part particularly interesting because it treats the different schools of philosophy of science and delves into the problems of the logic of scientific demonstration and explanation. A few other good ones: 

The original Latin of these two phrases is "secundum idem numero" (lit. "according to the same number," i.e., "to be numerically one" or individual/particular) and "secundum idem specie" (lit. "according to the same species"), respectively. For example, Socrates and Plato are not numerically one (they're distinct individuals), but they are specifically one (they're in the same species, both being humans). §36 St. Thomas's short summary, De Principiis Naturæ, of Aristotle's Physics might help regarding this distinction (the context is the four causes as they relate to change): 

cf. also l. 2 "The Four Classes of Causes. Several Causes of the Same Effect. Causes May Be Causes of Each Other. Contraries Have the Same Cause" So, the sun is a remote efficient cause of me,* and my parents** are a proximate efficient cause of me.*The sun helped plants grow so my parents could live and procreate me.**Aristotle seems to have thought the father was the only proximate efficient cause, but St. Thomas knew the woman wasn't completely passive in procreation; she contributes the material out of which my body is made, so she is also an efficient cause. Two efficient causes can work toward the same end, just as multiple builders can build the same house. 

"Symbiosis (from Ancient Greek σύν "together" and βίωσις "living") is close and often long-term interaction between two or more different biological species." $URL$ Assuming these married people belong to the same species, their pair-bond is not an example of symbiosis, by definition. In order for your idea to work, you would need to change the accepted definition of symbiosis. You and your gut bacteria are in symbiosis. It's true that they don't cook you breakfast; but they do help you digest it. 

Now you can see that any horizontal slice of the upper half cone is smaller (or larger, depending on which way your cone is oriented) than the size of the boundary; and any horizontal slice of the lower cone is larger (or smaller, respectively) than the boundary circle. There is no paradox. You can do the same thing in the plane. Take the unit circle. It divides the plane into two regions, the inside and the outside of the circle. The inside disk has the unit circle as its boundary; and the outside shape (the plane minus the unit disk) has the unit circle as its boundary. The unit circle is the boundary of both regions. It doesn't matter how you assign the boundary points, all to the inner region or all to the outer region or some to one and some to the other. No matter how you assign the points, the two regions have the same boundary, namely the unit circle. 

Thus, according to St. Thomas, the liar's paradox "propositions" are not real propositions at all because there is no corresponding thing for them that "exists or does not exist" and they do not "signify that which" they have "been made to signify." 

St. Thomas Aquinas, in Summa Theologica I-II q. 64 a. 2, gives the following objections against "whether moral virtue observes the mean:" 

Physics deals with that which is in motion and is material. Mathematics deals with that which is material and is not in motion [∵ mathematical objects do not move or change, but they are abstracted from physical objects, which do move or change] Metascience deals with that which is not in motion nor is material. 

See St. Thomas Aquinas De Ente et Essentia, proemium, which references Aristotle De Cœlo bk. 1, specifically 271b: 

God is entirely simple (not composed of parts), and God is immutable. God does not change in time; God is not in time; nothing about God changes. If this is so, how can God, for example, prohibit the Jews from eating pork before Christ, yet after Christ God allows those Jews who converted to Christianity to do so? Christians believe the God of the Old Testament and the New Testament is the same, one God. There are three kinds of law, forming a hierarchy: eternal, natural, and human. There are three types of precepts of the Old Law: moral, ceremonial, and juridical. The latter two were meant to prepare the Jews for Christ, and they ceased to bind after Christ, but the moral laws (natural law) are forever binding. 

It's more interesting to consider the case of making two cloned copies. They each start with the same exact state, identical to you; but from that moment on, they're independent. They each have an I. Now, so do you. If you're then killed, you're dead. Two new I's come into existence; each initially feeling and thinking exactly as you at the moment of cloning; and for every moment thereafter, a separate human being. An I. A subjective consciousness. As it happens we have a real world model in common use. In computer programming, a process is a thread of control with its own private memory space. Typically a process is a running program, such as a copy of your browser or an instance of a word processing program Now, a process can create another subprocess. (In Unix-like systems this is called a fork, but other operating systems have analagous constructs.) At the moment of forking the subprocess inherits the entire memory space of the parent process. At that moment, these are two separate processes, or running programs, executing in that machine. They have the exact same state at that moment. But from the moment of cloning and onward, these are two separate processes. They are totally independent of each other (except for the relationship of "is the parent of" that the OS remembers). No programmer would ever think they're "the same process." They're two separate processes ... independent software entities running under the operating system. They do happen to a) Run the exact same code. They execute the same program. They have the same code. b) The subprocess is initialized to have the exact same state as the parent process at the moment of cloning. It seems to me that the field of computer programming already has a rich metaphor for the notion of cloning. A cloned human is a new human that runs the same code (DNA and basic brain wiring) and initially has its state set equal to the state of the parent human. From that moment on, the two humans function independently, have different life experiences, develop their separate minds independently, act independently in the world. Exactly like a parent and child process in a Unix-like operating system. And for that matter, exactly the way a human makes a new child now! You spawn a new human and initialize it to a new-born infant state. Everyone instinctively understand that the baby is a new human being. Likewise if you cloned yourself, your clone would be at that moment a brand new human being; just one whose initial state was set equal to your current state. But it's a different I. And if they kill you, you're dead. It's your clone who will live. This is conceptually no different than a human giving birth. It's merely a question of setting the initial state. [For that matter, why not clone me but make me a lot younger!! There would be a market for that :-)] Now, how strong is my analogy between operating system process cloning and human mind-cloning or Star Trek transporter technology? As a metaphor it's solid. I think it provides great clarity when thinking about what it would mean to transfer a human consciousness into a different substrate. Whether it's literally true in some way ... we have no way of knowing. The science of consciousness (the "hard problem," as they say) is a tough nut to crack. We shouldn't be deluded by the fact that we have cool computer technology, into thinking that we'll soon be uploading minds. We don't even know what a mind is. 

For an excellent historical summary of the medieval physicists' various interpretations of Aristotle's Physics (and De Cælo) regarding this question, see: 

There's always been a distinction between and classification of the sciences. Classification of the Sciences Ancient Classification For example, the Aristotelian-Boethian classification has lasted for many centuries. Boethius, following Aristotle, wrote that the "Speculative sciences may be divided into three kinds: physics, mathematics, and metaphysics" (§II of Boethius's De Trinitate): 

Is epistemology—the study of knowledge, how knowledge is acquired—really the same as logic? If not, what are the differences between epistemology and logic? By logic, I mean the art by which we order or thoughts or the "science of reason", as St. Thomas Aquinas calls it in the proem of his commentary on Aristotle's Posterior Analytics. 

No, only primary matter can be "potentially nearly everything"—i.e., be united with a certain substantial form to form any possible substance. 

Benjamin Peirce defined mathematics as “the science which draws necessary conclusions.” (CP 4.229). C. S. Peirce's definition (MS [R] 14:4):
