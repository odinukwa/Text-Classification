Does he want an exact answer, or an estimation? If you don't know then don't give them an exact answer! They will keep you to it, and 9/10x you cannot "keep your word". Don't put yourself in this position and keep it vague by estimating. Simply tell him that you don't know, because you actually don't: because you lack experience or haven't gone in-depth yet. 

Ask your boss/manager to follow courses or training that would benefit your skills, like a workshop where you'll have to think about (and actually design) functional software designs. Attend a seminar/webinar where people will talk about work-related stuff you're interested in. When finished with your tasks, try to come up with features that would benefit the project and discuss it with your boss/manager. Read books on design patterns. Go to a congress. Try anything that'll improve you and make you more valuable to the company, due do the sheer knowledge you posess. You will become more valuable to your company because you can do more. 

Do you have knowledge of programming mobile apps (iOS, Windows Phone, anything but Android)? It sounds to me you haven't talked to your boss yet about the "how". You see, a website can be very substantial and contain many elements and pages. Also, a website is often targeted at much larger screens, so that more things can be displayed or performed on the website. You can't just plainly transform a website into an app. It doesn't work that way. Here are 2 options you should consider: 

A portfolio is something personal to me; something I built/made. It highly depends on your field, though. I'm a software engineer, and on my own portfolio I only list stuff that I worked on on my own and in my spare time. Stuff that I worked on for a company (whether it be in-house/freelance, ..) ends up on my LinkedIn in the Projects list. Designers and web designers/web developers most often use their portfolio as a showcase. Since you're a web developer yourself, I would recommend adding projects to your portfolio. If you're not sure whether you're allowed simply contact your previous company and ask whether it's ok to list some projects you worked on in your portfolio. I highly doubt they're going to say no to that :) 

To prevent full-focus on functionality, have someone assigned to focus on the UI when about 80% of the functionality is finished. If that person can put all his effort into the UI, the non-technical people will be less likely to criticize your work as "job half-done" because you had someone take care of the UI. As for the celebration, why not do that after each sprint? I always used to be a bit relieved when we finished a sprint, and if everybody is happy with the work delivered in that sprint it's worth celebrating. You could do this by kicking back with a couple of beers, or some cake. Or whatever rows your boat :) I would recommend to keep it simple though. 

I think it's a good strategy. The company asks this to get a sincere offer from you, and based on that they can get to a conclusion: 

Pretty sure you're aware of this, but I'll point out the obvious anyways: test, test, and do some more testing. There's so much that can go wrong if you don't do proper testing, one of many being removing data by accident. By mimicking the production environment with actual data, you can test in an environment that's realistic and keep errors and bugs to a minimum. Do keep in mind, even after hours of extensive testing, errors do and will happen. If they do, report to your supervisor/manager and explain. If by any means your code shuts down a database connection, millions of records that should've be inserted will go missing (just an example, though). If you find an error or suspect an error: let people know. 

Junior, Medior, and Senior titles are based on years of experience. Software Architect is not a title - it's a role, just like developer or consultant. I would say you're on the edge of junior/medior, considering the years of experience you currently have. 

Wait until he is calm. You obviously trigger him and that gets him angry. Don't keep pouring gas on the fire when it's already roaring. 

1 and 2 should be more than sufficient enough. 3 is always possible when people ask for it. Afterall, you did write it. 

He overreacted, but I understand someone would be at least confused in this kind of situation. is quite trivial, but it could happen that at the time you didn't understand what he meant by it. In such cases, I would keep pressing for more explanation. If I don't understand something it's mostly because I cannot visualize it. At those moments I ask colleagues/supervisors to help me visualize (by writing out code, or literally drawing a database table/scheme) it. This helps me a lot, it might do the same for you. 

There could be a definite reason ofcourse. But this seems a lot like they can't be bothered with informing people they didn't make the cut. 

You won't graduate until September, but you've already got yourself an interview - that's nice. If you can, go to the interview next week, else let them know you will be there July 4th. If you can't make it on either given dates, let them know either way. Now, if you would to be hired, they will ask you when you can start. If you tell them you graduate in September, you could start 1-2 weeks (or whatever you prefer) after you've actually graduated. This way they've filled the position and you've got yourself a job. Ofcourse, things might not pan out that positively if they're looking for someone who can fill the position right now. 

Everybody has his own reasons for resigning or switching jobs. All the employer sees when a jobless applicant applies, is that he/she needs that job. An applicant who already has work, wants that job, because reasons. Wanting a particular job > needing a job. 

Lying, however, is not an option. It could bite you in the arse and you will never regain your employers trust. You weren't fired because you performed bad. You were fired/laid off because the company thought you, and all the other people, were no longer beneficial enough to the company to keep. It sucks, but it isn't something you can be blamed for. Everyone is replaceable. Reorganizations happens every day. During interviews you actually proved you have the desired skill, techniques and knowledge to perform well. Now you have to gain the interviewers' trust to hire you. Do this by providing a letter of recommendation and/or reference(s) and tell them about the massive layoff of your previous company. 

I would not list Company Y as your employee, because you were never really employed there. What you could do, though, is list projects done at Company Y while employed at Company X. My direct colleagues work for the large global food and beverage companies, but they don't list them as their employer - they merely did projects for them (whether it be in our office, on-site, or from home). 

Reference letter? No. References in general? Yes. I work for a large contractor and am currently working as a developer at a high-tech company in Eindhoven area on the R&D department. This company did not ask for references. The previous project that I worked on was in finances and did require references. 

Convert the website to be compatible with mobile devices Break the website into multiple, smaller parts (for StackExchange pages, i.e.: a View to view a question and its belonging answers, a View to create a Question, and a View to create an Answer, etc.). Out of those parts you can assemble an app 

Speak to your direct boss first. This would be Vincent. Let him know that this kind of behavior is not acceptable (in the Western world). The fact that he "grew up in the Red Army" is not an (acceptable) excuse. Sure, someone can lose his temper.. but this frequently? If your direct boss won't listen, go to Russell. According to your story, this guy is calm and acts more professional. As he is also the boss of your boss, he might (be able to) do something about it. 

Yes, you'll most likely look dishonest. A regular cab driver wouldn't describe himself as a private chauffeur, because he isn't. If you think Senior Software Engineer fits you more because of your role and responsibilities in the company and prefer this title over Programmer Analyst IV (first question on an interview will be to explain the title and job, by the way), then discuss it with your boss and change it if you both agree to it. 

If you did a good job and never bad a bad performance review, simply ask your previous employer/manager for a reference or letter of recommendation. You stated: 

Couple of things. First of all: this is a hobby project. Your hobby project. The other developer was brought on to help you out with the website. Maybe I'm missing some information, but why does he think he has a say in what you're doing with your project? You are most likely in a learning process while enjoying something you like to do in your spare time (assuming you are going to school/working). You have already spent 9 months on the project, are you willing to throw that all in the bin by porting it to other languages opposed to developing new features or improving stuff? His suggestions hint at scalability. I do not think that applies to a hobby project such as this unless you really plan on achieving a large user base. To come back to your question, seeing he wants to change a lot of made decisions it's best (in my opinion) to let him go and move on solo. He's helped you out with the website as per your request (and according to your story he had no other role) and you are happy with the work he delivered. It's fine to leave it at that. Also, opposed to what BoboDarph suggested in his answer, I would not allow him to fork your work. Again, this is my opinion, but this project is quite proprietary and has cost you a lot of hours (and not to mention possible headaches). Are you willing to let others run free with all that you've worked hard for to achieve (read: game in current state)? 

I would rephrase this to: "If I got the position, what kind of training would I get?" Aside from that, I've always asked the person interviewing me why they chose the company, and how they like working there now. They'll most likely be intrigued by those questions and are happy to answer them (honestly as well). 

I would not ask this question myself in this way. You could rephrase it to something like "How do you think I could make a better fit?" 

A manager relies a lot on his team, as does the team rely on him. There are times where there's a strong performing team, with a poor performing manager. That can still work - for some time - but eventually, the manager will be replaced. Perhaps even by someone who informally took a managing role on himself during a project. A very good manager can also have a poor performing team, ofcourse. However, in that case, the manager most likely has quite some experience already and will get rid of people who are not performing. He will then probably be part of hiring new people in order to get a stronger team. Managers are reviewed on the basis of the team they manage. The team, most of the time, reflects how a manager performs, because it's his job to steer people in the right direction and make sure they have all the necessary tools, experience, and information for their job. 

1) If you're keen on burning bridges with your colleagues, then by all means, exclude her right away without hard feelings from your side. I strongly recommend otherwise, though. 2) She probably has her reasons not to chit-chat around you guys: most likely she's not comfortable (and thus has no idea what to talk about). If you really want to talk about non-work stuff, you will have to try her to open up. This can be extremely difficult if she's an introvert. However, even introverts will open up when they're comfortable. Ask her what she did last weekend, or is doing next weekend. Ask her if she made plans for the summer holidays. Ask her if she ever been to place-x. There's so many options really. 3) If you don't want to be around her during lunch, you can also "exclude" yourself. Go to a local bakery or coffeeshop during your break, go have lunch in a park. This is probably not what you're looking for, though, so I would say try to go with #2. 

A bit contradictory, but ok. If the company were to truly comply to equal opportunity in the hiring process, that would mean if you're more qualified for the job, they should hire you. Same goes that if anyone else is more qualified than you, they should hire that person; regardless of gender (and race etc.). So would it be a good idea to answer with "prefer not to answer"? No, simply state you are male. 

At the company I now work for, people don't usually do overtime. When they do, it's 1 to 2 hours max. However, when deadlines approach, they might make more hours. Also, when a system crashes (since they are constantly working on and improving production systems), they have to fix it (on-site), even when it's the middle of the night. Then again, as said before, it depends on the industry you work in. "My" company does industrial automation, so factories lose a lot of money if my colleagues don't show up.
