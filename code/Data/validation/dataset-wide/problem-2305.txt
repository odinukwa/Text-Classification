I have found the differences are mostly subconscious, and a matter of personal preference. Black blocks your widest of peripheral visions. You almost never look out that far, but your brain does process it. Clear silicone masks instead blur that part of your vision, permitting you to see rough outlines and colors. Some people find the black masks constricting, others (like myself) find it improves their focus. Some people find the clear masks increases their feelings of immersion, others (like myself) find they're distracting. Definitely try both styles at the store, and try to feel which one is best for you. 

For all the reasons in the other answers, one probably should not ask to be belayed by another group of climbers. There's just a lot of awkwardness involved, and a lot of strange risk in trusting someone with your life. However, if you do want to try to get belayed by others, don't be afraid to use a social approach. Go up to groups and chat with them a bit, show your interest both in the climb and in them. There's a reasonable chance they will offer to let you join, if you play it right. And if they don't, you still spent your time networking with the climbing community. Who knows what you might learn! 

When using trekking poles with a twist-and-lock locking mechanism, I've experienced slipping (the poles will slightly collapse during use, making you frequently extend and re-lock it). Is there something maintenance-wise that helps avoid this, or is it simply a sign of poorly-made poles? 

When downhill skiing (although I assume this would apply to cross-country skiing or snowboarding as well), when should a gouge caused by a rock or other obstacle be considered large or serious enough to take the skis in for base repair, and when can it be ignored? 

Those are kind of contrived examples, but basically when is it appropriate to use a PLB? If the answers are different for different countries, I'm wondering specifically about use in the US. 

A quick search online shows there are dozens of different types of hiking socks, with different materials, thicknesses, and properties. In general, what should you look for when shopping for hiking socks? What are the main differences, and what would make you choose one type over another? 

When skiing in the backcountry (or even in the trees at resorts), what can be done to minimize the risk of getting trapped in a tree well? 

When going into remote areas, it would be great to be able to communicate with the outside world, for emergency purposes or just to be able to call home on long trips. Is it practical for an average person to obtain and use a satellite phone? In other words, roughly what do they cost to buy or rent, how large are they, and what is the cost to use them to place calls? On what kind of trips would it make sense to consider this option? 

For a long time, there was a trend towards heavier shoes with more support. The logic was that it provided protection for your joints, and your anecdotal evidence suggests that it works. Bear with me for a moment, and permit me to take the argument to an unreasonable extreme. Encase you entire foot in a solid steel block, well up into the calf. Now you can prove without a question that you're protecting your ankle. Obviously that extreme example is unrealistic, but it does demonstrate that the "best" answer has to be a balancing act. Clearly there are advantages to support, and disadvantages to support. Otherwise we would all be either barefoot or wearing steel boots. One of the issues with the heavy boots I have identified is that they encourage dependence on them. There is a set of skills your body needs to practice to keep itself stable without relying on ankle support. If you always have heavy boots on, that skill (and its associated muscles) atrophies. As you mentioned, you found it horrible to try to go even a short distance with lightweight shoes. On the other hand, if you have light shoes, you are obliged to maintain stability, and will damage your body if you don't. If you're the kind of person that likes to get distracted and let their body do all the walking, you'll likely put yourself in a bad position with a high likelihood of ankle damage. Another issue is shock. If you have intentionally restricted motion of the ankle joint, you lose the ability to cushion blows using those tendons. The force is naturally taken up by the ankles and hips. Do you naturally walk on your heels? Then you probably will find that that ankle restriction really doesn't impact you all that much. If you naturally walk closer to the balls of your feet, losing that mobility has a much larger impact. In the end, the best answer is to do what is comfortable for you, but don't be afraid to explore outside of the box a bit. Your definition of comfortable may move. Personally, I like hiking with lightweight shoes. However, if you look at the military, who have to make tremendous slogs with heavy packs without twisting an ankle, they're all in high-support shoes for good reason. I don't think we'll see our armed forces deploying in Vibram toe shoes any time soon! 

Is bear spray (pepper spray specially formulated to be effective against bear attacks) effective against other animals, especially mountain lions or wolves? Or is there something in it specifically targeted towards bears that would make it less effective on other attacking animals? 

When using a CamelBak (or other hydration bladder system), it is easy for mold to grow if the bladder is left sitting with water in it. What is the best way to avoid mold (or other nasties) growing inside in between trips? 

There are many different kinds of insect repellents and bug sprays on the market: sprays and lotions, chemical and natural, huge percentages of DEET and lower percentages, etc. What type of bug repellent is most effective against mosquitoes? What types should be avoided or are just a marketing ploy? I'm not asking for specific product recommendations, but general advice about types of insect repellent (e.g. 100% DEET vs. 30% vs. citronella oil, etc.). 

Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) can be carried during outdoor activities to use in case of an emergency. But are there any guidelines on what exactly constitutes an "emergency"? For example, what about the following situations: 

During certain times of the year, some of the hiking trails near where I live wind through herds of elk standing on or near the trails. What precautions should you take when hiking among elk? 

Equal expressions would be "Leave no trace." and the sentiment of "pack it in, pack it out." Do not be needlessly invasive on the environment. If the place is pristine when you get there, it should be when you leave. 

In English, a common greeting used would be "Tight Lines", more on exiting the area than entering, to wish others luck. Although not a literal translation, it is considered equivalent. 

I raised both domestic and wild breeds of geese and other water fowl for a number of years. Eating human foods such as bread are notoriously poor for birds, especially wild breeds including bird rescue work. They like it, but it is like allowing kids to have candy as a main course for dinner. Some of the issues it can cause are manifested in leg and feet problems. Without seeing further video or the bird, it actually walking and running around, I could not say with any certainty if this bird is effected. At first glance, it appears to be chattering as it is doing it, which I would interpret as just being a "happy dance", it claiming the treat and wanting more. Looking closer though, I would have some concern. The goose was stepping on its own feet and the feet were toed in. They can do this, and I have seen healthy birds do so, but it is not typical. This is far more common with birds with injuries or structural issues of the legs. The bird is not showing other visible signs that I would normally look for with nutritional caused deformities so I suspect it may be fine, but I would have loved to have seen it moving across the field to confirm that. If I were to actually observe the bird, other signs I would look for would be angel wing, structural bowing of the legs, flayed hips, over weight, none of which are apparent so the bird is likely fine with the exception of possible angel wing. The gif clip is way to short and single angle so I cannot tell on angel wing. The bird would also walk like this if its legs were pegged, such as fishing line between them, but no visible sign of that without much clearer angel and resolution.
