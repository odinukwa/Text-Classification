The version of the Baire Category Theorem I have in mind is the statement that a countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete metric space is dense. The question is: is it likewise true that the countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete uniform space is dense? A look at the proof suggests that the answer should be no---it makes crucial use of the fact that the canonical uniform structure on a metric space is generated by the $\varepsilon$-balls of radius $\frac{1}{m}$ for $m\ \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. I thus started looking at complete topological groups that were not first-countable for a counter-example, with no luck (topological groups because they provide easy examples of uniform spaces, and not first-countable because first-countable topological groups have uniformities generated by a countable collection of covers (and also because (I think?) first-countable topological groups are metrizable).) Surprisingly, a quick Google search only pulled up one source that seems to mention this at all---Joshi in his Introduction to General Topology states (pg. 363) 

(There are of course left and two-sided versions of the above definitions.) It is well-known that every field possesses an algebraic-closure, which is unique up to (nonunique) isomorphism. What about division rings? 

Note that since the ideals of a ring form a bounded lattice, the set $IdealClosure(R)$ is also a bounded lattice. Now if $\mathcal{R}$ is some set of rings, let $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ be the collection of functions which assign to each ring $R$ an element of $IdealClosure(R)$. Again, $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ is a bounded lattice by defining the lattice operations pointwise, ring by ring. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a set containing at least one representative from each isomorphism class of the finitely presented commutative rings. Then we can assume $\mathcal{R}$ is countable. It seems then that given a few more 'naturality' conditions the set $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ would likewise countable. For example, without going to far into symbolic logic, a natural ideal closure operator would be defined by one of a countable collection of statements in FOL or ZFC. One obvious condition is this: an ideal closure operation should treat isomorphic rings equivalently, or more formally: if $R_1 \in \mathcal{R}$, $R_2 \in \mathcal{R}$, $\varphi: R_1 \rightarrow R_2$ is an isomorphism, and $cl_1 = c(R_1)$, $cl_2 = c(R_2)$ where $c \in IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ then $\varphi[cl_1(A)] = cl_2[\varphi(A)]$ for all $A \subseteq R$. What other conditions are reasonable? Are such sets of closure operations studied? 

I guess it is possible to gain some understanding at least understand rough bounds. I will just consider the case $d = 1$. First observe that $$ \|p\| _{\ell^2(X)} \leq \|p\| _{\infty}. $$ Second we have on can always choose a one point set $X$, depending on $p$ such that equality holds. Next, one can derive for $\Omega$ an interval bounds on $\|p\| _{\infty}$ from $\|p\|_2$ using the inequality $$ |p'(x)| \leq \frac{n}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \|p\| _{L^{\infty}([-1,1])} $$ (I hope I remember the constants correctly). Versions for several intervals can be found in an Acta paper by V. Totik (around 2000). So what one gets in this case is that $C ~ n |I|$. 

Here is one cute analysis application. Consider a continuously differentiable function $A(x)$ on a real argument and taking values in the $N \times N$ matrices. Furthermore suppose that $\lambda(0)$ is a simple eigenvalue of $A(x)$, i.e. $dim(\ker( (A - \lambda(0))^N )) = 1$. Then there exists a small interval $I$ containing $0$ and a function $\lambda(x)$ such that $\lambda(x)$ such that $\lambda(x)$ is an eigenvalue of $A(x)$. The proof is just applying the implicit function theorem to $$ f(x,E) = \det(A(x) - E), $$ since $\lambda(0)$ being simple implies that $\partial_E f(0,\lambda(0)) \neq 0$. Furthermore, using the characterization of eigenvalues using the determinant, one can get some geometric information on how the curve $\lambda(x)$ looks. 

Looking at the proof, I definitely see where it would no go through if we were restricted to strict subnets, and it seems as if there would be no easy way to fix this with this restriction. Of course, this doesn't mean that it can't be proven---maybe we just haven't been clever enough to figure out how to do it with only strict subnets? I am quite confident this is not actually the case, however, and that there is indeed a counter-example. Kelley presents an example (pg. 77 of his General Topology, attributed to Arens) that is meant to demonstrate why strict subnets are not enough. He presents an example of a net with a cluster point to which no subnet converges. Unfortunately, the example he gives is Lindelöf, but not quasicompact (and personally, I could live with nets not having subnets converging to cluster points (this is already the case for limit points, for example)). So then, is there a well-known example of a quasicompact space and a net with no convergent strict subnet? 

Given a topological vector space $V$, let its density be the smallest cardinal $A$ such that a set of cardinality $A$ is dense in $V$. Naively, it seems one of two things happen: 

More concretely, are there other cardinality related restrictions one can put on a TVS to obtain decent results, or are such pursuits apparently fruitless? Is any cardinality restriction looser than separability useful? [Note: Model Theory would have a lot to say about this, but I'm looking for additional perspectives as well. In addition, we could ask the same question about other structures, but I'd like to start with something concrete.] 

Recently I have come across the books Combinatorial Commutative Algebra by Miller and Sturmfels along with Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra by Stanley. I will soon own a copy of each. I also purchased a used copy of Multiplicities and Chern Classes in Local Algebra by Roberts. My question is about the edge of research in commutative algebra. Which books (such as the above?) represent the edge of current research? By that I mean complete comprehension of such a book would prepare one to tackle a valuable (but doable) open problem for graduate research. Perhaps this edge is better represented by articles and papers. Are there a lot of these being published and how has this varied over time? I'm trying to get at the current state of the area of commutative algebra by considering the more concrete topic of current literature on the topic, especially the literature that is spawning new open problems. 

In what follows, $x$ is always taken to commute with the coefficient ring. This means that for any given polynomial, you can put the coefficients to the right or the left of $x$ as you please. This doesn't make a difference to the ring itself, but it will make a difference for the roots: a right root is an element that yields zero upon evaluation when you write $x$ to the right of the coefficients. (Similarly for left root. I suppose a two-sided root would be an element that is both a right and a left root.) For example, $\mathrm{j}$ is a right root but not a left root of the following polynomial (working in the quaternions). $$ \mathrm{i}x-\mathrm{k}. $$ 

What I have in mind is the following: a (sequence of) functor(s) $K_\bullet$ on the category of topological $^*$-algebras (with values in the category of commutative groups) that satisfies (among other properties one would wish a $K$-theory functor to possess) (i) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{op}}(A)$ when $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra and (ii) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{alg}}(A)$ when $A$ has involution the identity and the discrete topology. As a matter of fact, a quick skim of the construction of $K_0^{\text{op}}(A)$ (as the grothendieck group of unitary equivalence classes of projections in $M_\infty (A)$) seems as if would work verbatim for an arbitrary topological $^*$-algebra, and furthermore, would give the same definition in the case of involution the identity and the discrete topology (this uses the fact that if self-adjoint elements are conjugate, then they are in fact unitarily equivalent). (I suppose one possible issue with extending this to the higher $K$-groups in the most obvious way is determining the 'right' topology to put on the tensor product of topological $^*$-algebras in order to define the suspension.) Does there exist such an extension? If not, why not? If so, is there a reference? 

The eigenvalues are simple. In fact one has $\lambda_j - \lambda_{j-1} \geq e^{-c n}$, where $c$ is some constant that depends on the $b_j$. The eigenvalues of $A$ and $A_{n-1}$ interlace. 

Since, it hasn't been mentioned yet a short addition to José Figueroa-O'Farrill's answer. I will only talk about the finite dimensional case. So let's assume that $dim(P) = 2n$. Then the Hamiltonian flow is integrable if there exist these $n$ functions $f_1, \dots, f_n$ which are in involution with respect to the Poisson structure. Now, the cool thing is that there exist action angle coordinates. These means we can conjugate our possibly complicated dynamics to the simple dynamics $$ \partial_t I_j = 0,\quad \partial_t \theta_j = I_j,\quad j=1,\dots,n $$ this is something, we can all solve since it is just linear. Note: We will have $I_j = f_j(orbit)$, which is time independent. As a possible application, KAM theory is usually formulated as an application to systems in action angle coordinates. This in turn implies that integrable systems are stable (in a subtle measure theoretic sense). But I think this is what is meant with "integrable $\neq$ chaos". We have a great form of perturbation theory for integrable systems. 

If $x:\Lambda \rightarrow X$ is a net in a topological space $X$ and $\Lambda '\subseteq \Lambda$ is a cofinal subset of the directed set $\Lambda$, then $x|_{\Lambda '}$ is a subnet of $x$. We call subnets of this form strict subnets. Of course, not all subnets are of this form, and indeed, the definition of a subnet is chosen the way it is in part so that certain theorems we would like to be true are in fact true. I am in particular curious about the following standard theorem. 

but yet does not provide a counter-example either. Also, I doubt this will make too much of a difference, but I would prefer the counter-example to be $T_0$. Finding an example of a highly pathological space that is, uhh, pathological, isn't exactly what I'm looking for. 

For what it's worth, the motivation is that this colimit is the usual definition of the sheaf on a not-necessarily-open subset $K$ (or if you like, the global sections of the inverse image sheaf under the inclusion $K\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$), and so it would be nice if this colimit had a relatively concrete description. 

Entropy is not defined for a single probability measure! Entropy is a relative thing, you define between two measure $\mu$ and $\nu$. Then the entropy is defined by $$ \mathcal{E}(\mu,\nu) = \begin{cases} - \int w(x) \log(w(x)) d\nu(x),& d \mu = w d\nu; \\\ -\infty, & otherwise.\end{cases}, $$ I might have messed up the signs. $w$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivate of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$. 

The following might be too naive, it comes from my understanding of the self-adjoint case. Consider the representation on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ given by $$ U \psi(n) = e^{2\pi i n} \psi(n),\quad V\psi(n) = \psi(n+1). $$ Then, we want to consider $H = U + V$. Now comes the thing, where I am not sure, if $z$ is in the spectrum, then there exists a solution $\varphi$ such that $$ (H - z) \varphi = 0,\quad \lim_{n\to\pm\infty} \frac{1}{|n|}\log(|\varphi(n)|) = 0 $$ whenever $z$ is in the spectrum of $H$. We can assume that $\varphi(0) = 1$. A computation then shows that we must have $$ \lim_{N \to \pm\infty} \frac{1}{|N|}\sum_{n=0}^{N} \log|z - e^{2\pi i n}| =0, $$ which is the case whenever $|z| = 1$ (Here I use some ergodic theorem). 

Is there a single suitable reference to study for the smooth manifold (geometry) half of a typical Topology/Geometry PhD preliminary exam at an average AMS group I school? (Note: I know details about the presentation of these prelim tests varies, but at many schools there is a single Topology/Geometry exam, half of which is roughly smooth manifolds "Geometry" and the other half algebraic topology "Topology") Being a bibliophile, I've invested some time looking around at various qualifying exam syllabi until something stuck out: for Topology, relatively fewer books are listed. It seems quite often a book like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher is listed along with one or two others (seemingly to cover certain small gaps). Also, for Algebra, a few books often suffice... the books by Lang, Jacobson, and Dummit & Foote are often listed. One or two of these together with an outlier often suffice. Compare that to the situation with smooth manifolds. One site (which I lost track of... UCR?) I saw listed as many as 8 books as references for the topic! Many universities seem to use Guillemin & Pollack despite teaching manifolds abstractly, rather than as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is understandable, but somewhat pedagogically suspect and in my own experience as a student, confusing. It appears that the topic of smooth manifolds needs an expository text that fills the same role for Geometry as does Algebraic Topology (Hatcher) does for Topology. Some sensible criteria: 

Another suggestion Annals: to appear. Also other top journals. If a big problem gets solved, its solution probably gets submitted to a journal of this type, so its to appear lists are what you are looking for. Of course, you only learn about the solution of the problem a few years late (refereeing takes time), but you can be almost certain that the solution is actually correct. 

Here is how to obtain a formula for $R_{k,m}$. Denote by $x_1, \dots, x_m$ the zeros of $H_m$. We have that $$ H_k(x) = P(x) H_{m}(x) + R_{k,m}(x) $$ for all $x$, so in particular for $x_j$ that $$ H_k(x_j) = R_{k,m}(x_j) $$ since $H_m(x_j) = 0$. So we know $R_{k,m}(x_j)$ at $m$ points, and it is a polynomial of degree $m-1$, so it is uniquely determined. In particular, one could write down a formula for it using some interpolation method. I guess to understand this gadget, one would need to understand $H_k(x_j)$, which my first guess would be to check the already linked Abramowitz--Stegun book...
