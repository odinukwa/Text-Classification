In this case, we can infer both that Alex is not walking in the forest and that Alex is not walking on the street. Now let's make it a bit more formal. Valid in logic means that if the premises happened to be true, then the conclusion must also be true. By the counter example above, we have shown that the pattern you refer to as (2) can have a false conclusion with true premises. This pattern is the fallacy called "denying the antecedent." 

I know this dog has yellow fur. This dog by necessity has yellow fur. Yellow fur is a necessary property of this dog. 

A second feature of the quote that is all quasi-Socratic is that the Apology points out that the oracle has inscribed: "Know thyself" ($URL$ and that Socrates puts this to good use in the Apology in suggesting that his wisdom is that he followed this advice.... But the problem is that Socrates in Apology takes the thing he knows to be that he knows nothing -- rather than that he has solid knowledge of the definition of terms. 

But many modern views believe actual infinities are possible, solving problem 2, and many believe causality is in the mind -- semi-solving problem 1. In medieval logic, arriving at an actual infinite is the same as arriving at a contradiction -- a sign that something has gone wrong. 

I am not quite sure how to think about your question. In part, I don't have any idea where you are coming from or what degree of training you have in philosophy. I think one issue is that it's hard to define the "core of philosophy" so many of the people writing sociology and political science as continental philosophy do so because they think that is the core. Or to put it another way, many of them are engaged in a critique of standard notions of metaphysics and epistemology (I studied this for several years before deciding on modern philosophy as my AOS because I don't think their critiques are as effective as the hype machines make them out to be). For instance, I take it to be central to Foucault's history of ideas approach that he doesn't think we're doing much other than playing language games so we should be honest about things are moving. A similar historical approach with different results is taken by Charles Taylor. In both cases, there's a Hegelian heritage at work there. (On the analytic or "post-analytic" side, you may want to compare this with Richard Rorty). If you're looking for continental thinkers doing "metaphysics/ontology" or "epistemology" however they might define those terms or however similar their projects might be. Then I might suggest Martin Heidegger and his text "What is Metaphysics?" along with Being and Time as good intros to continental approaches to these questions. A major movement that builds (or at least grows) on this in epistemology is hermeneutics with Gadamer being a key figure. Alternately, you could look at the phenomenological tradition more broadly going to back to Husserl and then forward to a variety of thinks including Jean-Luc Marion and Jean-Luc Nancy. Levinas is hard to follow but also kind of about "metaphysics" depending on what you mean by the term (and falling in line with the phenomenologists in some respects). Sartre's Being and Nothingness is about epistemology and is an elaborate (and winding and confusing) critique of Hegel and several other thinks about the nature of knowledge. (It was also parodied by the philosophers of language on the analytic side). Derrida is also engaged in a kind of critique of knowledge project. 

considering what is universally required OR identifying what is necessary to respect rational beings as ends. 

The Kantian definition of talent in the context of imperfect duties is that these are abilities that can help others. The reason for this is that the justification for why we must develop our talents follows from a human limitation and the Categorical Imperative. Specifically, as human beings, (1) we need help at different points in our lives and The Categorical Imperative means that we need maxims that can be universal. But this means that we somehow need the Categorical Imperative to include requiring rational creatures to provide us with aid. So we universalize that and it applies back upon ourselves. Thus, the talents that matter are those that can help people. From this, however, it does not follow that juggling is excluded. Because we have wide latitude in selecting our talents that we develop. And there are many different forms of assistance we may need throughout our lives. What seems like it would be excluded is an ability that is improved which could never help others or an improvement in level in ability that one could not conceive of helping others. So then maybe playing video games is not a talent under this definition. But again, we are not required to spend every waking moment improving our talents. 

The second way is just to say that what she's saying does not square with reality. I don't think that shows up on any list of fallacies, but it is fallacious none-the-less. I guess you could say what she says is valid but not sound and she's confusing validity with soundness. Or you could just say there's an empirical defeater for her argument. 

Now this definition actually does some of the legwork for us. But there's more that is helpful in Kant. Returning to the two examples from the text (which based on your choices I'm going to assume is the Groundwork), we can see why Kant still (probably) can say they are wrong: In the case of lying, it's not merely that truth is lost but that the ability for other agents to act rationally is lost. Thus, it impugns the rationality of creatures and is thus immoral. Similarly, property is for Kant a rational feature of things (this is expounded in the Metaphysical Doctrine/Principle of Right). Thus, to undo it is to remove something he takes to be necessary to rationality. (This one is clearly the more dubious of the two proofs since the definition of property is far from evident in our retrospective capacity). Also, I must add as an addendum that there are two variants of the universalizability test in the Groundwork. One checks whether it is incoherent on a purely logical basis. The other asks whether it could be a universal law of nature. On my interpretation the latter adds what one takes to be the necessary laws of the universe. 

My memory of it's all a little hazy, but you could read hundreds of pages on this in the late medieval philosophy literature in both the Christian and Islamic parts. Obviously, outside of these options, you can say the incoherence is in the concept of God. But I take the hinge that makes the unliftable rock incoherent vis-a-vis God to be the account I mention in 1 -- that also appears in the SEP article on omnipotence. 

For Kant, morality only applies to rational beings. At some points, he will use the word "humanity" as a synonym. Thus, if we look at the second group of formulations of the categorical imperative we find: 

Augustine in the City of God adapts elements of Plato's philosophy to present the idea of dual citizenship for Christians in Rome and Heaven. On such an account, the state below is more arbitrary and maleable since the image of justice is through religion not the state. I'm not familiar enough with Aquinas's account of the state to provide the contours, but I gather it's a somewhat communitarian picture but not overly prone to allowing schisms emphasizing the holistic aspects of the Aristotelian picture. 

The face-value reading sounds plausible in a certain way, but it's also quite plausible to view him as never holding the naive belief that the people who said they were smart are not. If we want to restructure the argument in the terms of modern logic, we would state that he's doing a reductio against the assumption that they are wise and this forces him to recognize them as fools and thus himself as wise insofar as he doesn't make the foolish claim to know things. 

Before getting your specific example, we should specify a few things. First, there's more to Kant than just the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (you called it "Foundations" -- let's stick with that). There's also the Metaphysics of Morals itself ("MM"), and of particular concern to us, the Tugendlehre (which the second half of "MM") which is often translated "Doctrine of Virtue" or "Metaphysical Principle of Virtue" (we'll say "MPV"). Sticking just to the Foundation, the formula of humanity is paired with the formula of rationality. The idea behind both is to: 

I think there's a few problems with the argument you've formulated and attributed to Descartes. I'd say one issue that happens here is what "you" means arguably shifts throughout the argument. 1 maintains that "you" engage in acts of imagining without "your body" but it's not clear that the two uses of you are the same here. This unhinging where there's a separate thinking part is key to making the argument work, and it's also a problem insofar it is the assumption of dualism. A second issue is that it's (now) a contentious claim that conceivability = metaphysical possibility. But even if we grant that, it doesn't at all follow that merely because something is metaphysically possible that it is actually so or genuinely "separable" in any lose way. To give a trivial counterexample, it's metaphysically possible that the same person as me could exist without either his left eye, right leg, part of his heart, part of his kidney, or part of his bone marrow, ad infinitum. It doesn't at all follow that this mean the same thing can exist if all of these things are absent. (This is a variation on the ship of Theseus being used as a reductio). If the physical example is unwarranted, we can do the same thing with cognitive capacities. Descartes promulgates a list (once or twice in Med 2 at least; again in Med 3 I think) of all the different faculties of mind. Remove one and maybe it's the same res mensa; remove all and it's nothing. But if conceivable removability means not just non-identity or part-whole identity but that the part is not constitutive of the whole, then it turns out that none of these faculties are necessary for the "you." Of course return to the very top line here. I don't think this is quite what Descartes argued or even the best way to formulate it. I think Descartes' argument is stronger than what you've laid out (though still flawed) in that Descartes depends on two things to motivate his position: (1) the vicious cycle of doubt and (2) the circular relation between the proof of the self and the proof of God. A good source to read on this is John Cottingham. The vicious cycle is that either cognitive faculties are trustworthy -- in which case we can trust their judgment that a thinking thing exists and engage in these acts or they are not trust-worthy in which a thinking thing is engaging in the act of doubting them and therefore exists. (The thinking thing doubting that the thinking is doubting does not lead to a bad infinite regress because the argument does not hinge on the content of the doubting). It's also important to note that Descartes' all-things-considered view (not the caricature people present of him) does not deny knowledge from the senses or the validity of the senses, it just puts this beneath the divided line. 

When I say "argument", the most basic patterns are things like "modus ponens" and "disjunctive syllogism." 

The first sentence is just simply what is meant by the universalization formulation of the Categorical Imperative. You can find it in the Groundwork and elsewhere. The second and third sentences raise a claim that is somewhat debatable, because much hinges on how we describe human actions. Just to illustrate, Utilitarians are not committed to this since they think people act for pleasure (which need not be complex). Aristotelians and virtue ethicists tend to have a complex picture of action. A second issue is whether we should understand actions in terms of motivations. The other option is to understand them in terms of reasons. The motivation picture is more Humean than Kantian (see Marcia Baron, Kantian Ethics Almost without Apology and Christine Korsgaard). The relationship between these ideas is complex, but it seems like Kant believes it is possible to have a moral action which finds its origin in the will acting in accordance with reason. (This can be accompanied but not caused by a feeling or subjective motivation for Kant). If this is what the objection is getting at, then it may be the case that the OP and Kant just have different ideas about what action is. The second paragraph, however, highlights a real problem in Kant's philosophy. Kant never really gives us a clear explanation of what a "maxim" is or how it relates to one's action and how it becomes universal. Consequently, it is a real question whether we can pick the descriptions of the actions we undertake. Allen Wood, Henry Allison, and Thomas Hill (inter alia) have all worked on this problem. My memory may be a little fuzzy here but the parts that I found convincing in this account are : You cannot maxim shop -- it is not a question of picking a maxim that could explain your action and be universalizabe. It's a legitimate question of what you wanted to do when you acted. This seems pretty convincing to me, because maxims are not alibis; they are descriptions of the structure behind your actions. Actions do admit some multiple descriptions the same action could be described in multiple ways. Kant admits the same in the quodlibetal questions that follow each section of the Metaphysics of Morals: Doctrine of Virtue. Here, we have Kant saying that banter that includes untruths like "that's a splendid dress" or "of course you look fine" are not lies. Or similarly that willing that you die to protect others is not suicide. Or that killing in war is not murder. The danger is that once you open the door to these sorts of re-descriptions, it's not clear how you justify some and not others. In my view, Kant does not have great resources for defending the quodlibetal questions. This is a central part of Hegel's critique of Kant (in Natural Law, again in Phenomenology of Spirit, again in Philosophy of Right) -- that "pure reason" alone is not adequate to create descriptions of real human situations and that we need societal knowledge to bridge the gap. Many contemporary Kantians agree. Some of them argue that Kant was already saying this (Korsgaard, Rawls, Nancy Sherman, Thomas Hill, and Allen Wood -- who interestingly says this in conversion from the Hegelian position). Others admit Kant did not say this but don't care (Habermas). To recap, there's two issues going on here: 

Might I suggest, Cambridge's Critical guide to Kant's Groundwork edited by Jens Timmermann The purpose of the text is to help readers understand it, and the list of authors includes several good Kant scholars. A brief skimming on Google Books also says that it isn't too hard to read and while making the reader aware of complexities does not mire them into them. 

Ad hominem is the name of type of informal fallacy. I say that because the problem is that informal fallacies are more "rules of thumb" than hard fast strictly-defined philosophical terms. So often many different names will apply to the same fallacy or many different fallacies will occur in the same fallacious statement. That said, this looks more to me like the genetic fallacy.
