I recently bought a used Canyon Ultimate that has an Acros headset on it. I'm trying to remove the stem but for the life of me can't figure out how to take it off. The top cap doesn't have a vertical bolt but instead is just hollow. I've removed the stem bolts and the stem freely rotates on the steerer tube,but I can't take it off because of the top cap. I've never encountered this type of headset before, surely I must be doing something stupid? Picture of what I mean: 

On the other hand, it definitely worked and would let you tow the box or maybe 50 kilograms of stuff. I should have fastened it lower on the seat post, but that would mean the rack was unusable. 

You should get away with the new freewheel by itself, simply take the freewheel off the current wheel and fit that. You will need a chain tool to shorten your chain, and depending on the dropouts you may need a chain tensioner, or you might be lucky. Note that while you don't need new chainrings, you won't be able to shift front gear without either a chain tensioning arm, or leaving the rear derailleur in place, to take up the slack. 

Currently I am running a semi compact 52/36 up front and a 11-28 at the back. I'm planning on getting a 11-23 cassette for criterium races, and have the 11-28 for hillier rides. Will there be any issues with chain length when swapping back and forth between the two? If I leave the chain length as is (optimized for a 11-28), will I run into any problems when putting the 11-23 in? 

I've recently acquired a new set of (aluminium) wheels, and at first they were fine, but now when I brake the rear lightly I can feel a shuddering/vibration through the bike. If I press the brake harder, 9/10 times, it will make a loud honking noise, which kind of sounds like an angry goose (i.e. it is not a squealing noise) These are rim brakes btw, as most threads I've searched are a similar problem but are with disc brakes, not rim brakes. What I did was: 

I've been doing exactly this with a Raleigh Arena 10 speed bike. Its ridiculously expensive to buy new parts for this old bike, so I was fortunate to pick up a crash damaged road bike that had frame damage but the transmission was okay. You need long-reach brake calipers to move from the 27" wheel to a 700c wheelsize, which is 4mm smaller. I got some NOS Tektro R556 dual pivot calipers cheap, and while they fit the front wheel perfectly the rear still doesn't reach the rims. More work required here. From $URL$ The donor bike had Shimano 105 3x9 and that has transferred across okay. I was astonished that the cartridge BB fitted right in. The front derailleur is clamp-on and requires a shim for the smaller seat post. I also had to be creative with the pull cable routing given its bottom pull and the original front mech was a top-normal bottom pull "Spirt" Rear wheel spacing was also surprising in that the rear wheel fits perfectly, but in the smallest gear the chain binds on the frame. So this needs fiddling. Up the front end, I chose to stay with my original drop bars. The quill stem stays for now too while I fiddle with fit, but it will likely change to a much shorter one. You do not need to replace the fork to change the wheels. However aluminium rims will do a lot both for safety on braking and for overall lightness. The old Chromed steel rims didn't brake very well, and got worse in the rain. You can get Quill Stems down to 20mm in length, and it saves the cost of a replacement fork. Getting a safe 1" threadded fork is going to be hard enough, plus the threadded to threadless adapters are a bit of a bodge. I'd get a nice used quill stem off ebay, I intend on running 35mm tyres, mostly because I have them already and they fit fine. Not sure about the stubby mudguards. In reality they aren't worth it, but they look so right on the bike. But mine are completely rusted. 

I just installed a new 6800 groupset on my bike for the first time, and everything went O.K except for the front derailleur. I can't shift it into the big ring, if I push the lever to change to the big ring, it won't go all the way, and it won't make a click. If I push just the smaller lever (to get into the small ring) it makes a click just fine, but if I push the big lever, it will move a bit but not enough to click. If I disconnect the cable from the FD, I still can't get the lever to move and make a click. Is the cable stuck somewhere? 

Answer: Both Brakes are absolutely critical number 1 top priority to have working on your bike. The wheels being out of true will impact on your ability to fix the brakes properly. What tools do you have available? I would expect you will require: 

Practice Here's the big one.... You spend under a minute riding this MTB. It could take anything up to 30 minutes to get "dialed in" to the various inputs required. Changing between significantly different bikes can be hard 

The fix will likely involve removing your stem and handlebars, and cleaning/regreasing the ball bearings in your headset. Then adjusting them to be Just Right. At the moment I think they're too loose. Hopefully you've caught this problem before the bearing races have been damaged. 

This seemed to stop it for a few rides, but the noise has come back again. Any ideas on what could be causing this? I am also using the correct pads as recommended by the wheel manufacturer (Shamal Mille, with Campy blue pads). Note: An example of the noise can be found here: 

Turns out it was the rear skewer of all things causing the creaking! It seemed like it was from the bottom bracket area because it was in sync with my pedalling but I put a dab of grease near the contact points of the skewers and the noise is gone. So if anyone else is having similar problems, check your skewers first because it's a lot easier than taking your cranks and bottom bracket apart. 

Last resort is to use Strava's power guesstimate. Its pretty useless for peak power or instant power, but over the course of a ride, the average power seems "reasonable" as an estimate. Main bonus is this is free. 

The simplest way is simply stop in an open space and feel where the wind is coming from, using your face. Downside is that any trees or buildings will make the wind veer, and traffic makes its own wind. Plus you have to stop (anathema!) Flags work really well, because they're often up high and in the real airstream. You can also check the local weather report for your area. For me that's $URL$ but you should have something similar for your location. 

When pedaling with a decent amount of force a very loud creaking sound can be heard coming from the bottom bracket area (it is very loud when standing on the pedals). It makes a creaking noise on each foot's down stroke. So with both feet pedaling equals two creaks per full revolution. If I unclip either foot and pedal with only one foot, a creaking noise will be heard once per revolution (on the down stroke of the pedaling foot). If I pedal softly, no noise is heard. Things that I have done so far, yet the problem remains:
