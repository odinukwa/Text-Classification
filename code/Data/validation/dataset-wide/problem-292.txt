not releasing waste upstream from someone else (as hinted at by Mystagogue); having some waste-clearing system (analogous to our sewerage systems), perhaps a stand of specially cultivated plants that are known to be good clearers; And once the technology develops, perhaps a technological implementation of a device that can receive the required amount of water+waste, filter out the waste, and return the clean water back to the living environment. This could perhaps take the form of a cubicle or other enclosure where the elimination action could be done (in privacy), or perhaps some sort of suction head brought close to or in contact with the relevant body orifice (less private, perhaps more efficient). Privacy requirements would depend very much on the particular culture and its taboos. Cleaning would be less of an issue that for humans. No toilet paper equivalent probably needed. 

I think it may depend largely on the alien's physical makeup and/or cultural history. As others have pointed out, humans use base-10 (because of number of fingers), base-60 (historically for easier calculations) etc. So it is completely conceivable that an alien race may prefer base-3 (ternary). Perhaps this alien race has an Artificial Intelligence origin (intelligent machines based on computers) and some analyses here on earth have shown that a base-3 system would be the most economical way to build a digital computer (but only slightly more so than base-2 (binary) or base-4). Or maybe they have some special evolution that makes their brains very much like a biological computer, and selection selected the most economical brain structure (ternary) due to resource limitations. Thomas Fowler built a balanced ternary (-1, 0, +1) computer out of wood in 1840, and had this to say: 

Developed the idea of a difference in time units due to seasonal and astronomical observations. So you need to take that away, e.g. a civilization that has developed in an isolated valley with perpetual cloud overcast - in the tropics so no noticeable seasons or day length differences. Or maybe developed in a grotto system / abandoned mine. Or even in polar regions, staying indoors 24/7. (Perhaps it needs adding that an agricultural society is very much dependent on observations of the seasons so as to plant and reap at the right time. Agriculture and animal husbandry has been the first step away from hunter-gatherers, and archeology has shown that this led to a rapid development towards cities, specialized occupations, laws and writing - planning, wars, .... - in other words all things "civilization"). Developed special connotations for some time periods (rest day or day for festivities) due to religion. So you would have to prevent that from being developed - not sure what the prevailing theories are on the evolution of religion. 

A lot of suggestions have been offered, but none seem acceptable on all requirements. So here is an even more whacky suggestion. What about a poison that poisons the mind, rather than the body? I'm talking of something like Stockholm syndrome. A notable example in real life is Patty Hearst. Anybody with some knowledge of the appropriate science and the necessary means can apply the biological run-of-the-mill type of evil if needs be. To pull off this sort of psychological manipulation would to my mind require a whole deeper, darker level of calculating heartless Evilness, spelled with a capital letter. It also has the potential to turn just another action novel into a profound psycho-thriller... Let's look at the requirements: 

What about Decompression Sickness? Joe could be kept in a prison kept at a high air pressure - both the toxin and the antidote against the effects of ambient air pressure - (needs not be underwater, even though divers in real world are most aware of this). Joe could be unconscious while his prison is being pressurized, and he will never be the wiser: it won't leave any marks. Depending on the pressure, suddenly escaping from the pressurized environment would be highly unpleasant, harmful, or even fatal. The most obvious cure would be slow decompression, which can take a lot of time (and needs the necessary equipment). Building such a prison, one would have to design it so that an escapee does not have access to the airlock (or at least the pump) and will have no other choice than to emerge into normal air pressure at once. Well, perhaps disguising the airlock as an elevator... when you enter a certain secret code, it follows the slow decompression protocol, but when an escapee who does not know it just presses "ground level", it depressurizes rapidly to ambient pressure and opens to the outside world. Of course, access to Joe from the outside world would be through that airlock, which for humans may take a lot of time because of the same reasons. But not for robots or other mechanical means of delivering his food. Food in airtight packages (bags, bottles, etc.) would give the game away as the contents inside the package would have much less pressure than outside and so be squashed flat. He could be in contact with his captor (and other humans) through CCTV (etc.). No physical contact. Except maybe in emergencies, e.g. medical treatment, where the personnel could reach him fairly quickly, but will need to go through lengthy decomp when they leave. It would probably take some good money and specialized skills to build the prison (think spaceships or deep-sea vessels), but in a way that it is not obviously a high-pressure container to its inhabitant. But could be done, e.g. housing box made with conventional materials and techniques, inside a large high-pressure (round) cylinder. Or an old (still sound and tight) submarine hull could be repurposed if one has a handy one lying around... 

Oh, and "bathroom" would probably be an incongruous term to them. Can't imagine someone bathing that is submerged in water for pretty much all of his life. 

My observations of many higher-living land animals (birds, spiders, even monkeys) is that they do not have much concern for toilet habits: they just do it and let it drop out of their living space. Fish and other aquatic organisms very much the same, although in their case they depend on dilution and filtering by symbiotic organisms (if unknown to you, you may want to read up on aquaponics, a system to raise both fish as a protein source, in tanks, and circulate their water through plant crops for removal of their nitrogen-rich waste, which incidentally also is a very good nutrient/fertilizer for the (edible) plant crops). Of course, many surface dwelling social animals are known to create communal toilet areas or dung middens (quolls, hyraxes, some antelope species, rhinos, even modern humans on the conceptual level at least). But it is not a universal trait (one can argue that humans and monkeys are pretty close, evolution-wise). I would expect that merfolk would start out just like fish. Once they developed culture and society to the level that their increased numbers caused problems in the health department, they would develop some cultural solutions to the problem, e.g. 

Of course, not all iron-containing materials are equal. In the old folklore days one might have had much less choice between different alloys, but these days a lot of advances have been made in the metallurgy science. Manipulating objects (that have at least some iron content, e.g. nails) via controlling magnetic fields (perhaps induced via strong electrical currents in the brain) must seem like magic (google levitating magnets). These could conceivably be deflected via other ferromagnetic objects... I wonder if nerve tissue would really be able to withstand such quite powerful electrical surges... Maybe only certain people having such a very rare genetic trait, which may be passed on to offspring. Such an explanation would severely limit the kinds of "magic" possible, much less than what one reads about in fantasy novels. Then again, the folklore of old may have tended to exaggerate especially after some generations of oral transmission. Seems you are venturing into Magneto territory. 

Science-based: well, one can argue that psychology is "not really" hard science. On the other hand, this sort of thing has already happened and is documented (see references above). "Making it work" will leave a lot of leeway to the story-teller, much more than a (possibly implausible) chemical/biological/physical action would. Joe working for Dr E: once Joe is indoctrinated initially during his captivity, he should be a reliable minion to do Dr E's bidding. Not much risk in releasing him into the wild. (viz. Hearst participating in bank robberies). Dr E cruelly killing off Joe: He might not need to do that in the end. On the other hand, an antagonist capable of inculcating a subject with Stockholm Syndrome, could also quite conceivably be capable of implanting suggestions of sufficient guilt or worthlessness so that the subject commits suicide, or otherwise destroys himself (e.g. alcoholism/drugs). Antidote enabling Joe to escape: Well, Dr E might underestimate Joe's psychological clued-up-ness (because he is purported to be this stereotypical all-physical action jock with not much intelligence, see), so once (the more intelligent) Joe (with the deeper character) catches on to the mind games Dr E is busy playing on him, it's all cat-and-mouse subterfuge and counter-subterfuge from then on, potentially leaving the reader to guess "has he or hasn't he" until the end. But as said, that is a whole different story-telling ball game. 

Your advanced race could colonize it because of prestige ("the coolness factor" / "because it's there" / "because we can"). Prestige in the difficulty of not only getting onto the planet, but hardening the colony against the radiation, tidal forces, and all the other cons mentioned in other answers. Sort of a galactic "my tech capability is bigger than your tech capability" contest. Similar to the Cold War era "space race" here on earth. Not sure if that would be very advanced, or very immature, though... but hey, you might just have the need for such an antagonistic race in your story. 

I would imagine that constant hardships (brought about by the environment) may contribute to valuing constant productiveness and also bland food - I think that both entertainment and culinary developments (as well as specialized occupations) are very much a result of having "too much time". If you have to work form well before sunrise to well after sunrise to get enough food just to stay alive, you don't worry much how it tastes or how to keep yourself occupied until you need to work again - all available time is spent working or sleeping. Over time, this might get ingrained into such a population's culture even if circumstances change. 

A species that is so long-lived will have a very different culture compared to humans, because of their life cycle: Population "turn-over" (old individuals dying and being replaced by children) will be very low, thus preservation of knowledge will probably be much less of an issue. The spread of knowledge (and fiction) could in all probability be a lot more dependent on an oral tradition. This again would place a greater emphasis on memory and perfect recall. It would also lead to a more coherent social structure. This suggests the question: will they have a need for books, and if so, what for? I guess that such species will either have a very much slower rate of discovery of knowledge, leaving them in some pre-modern state of technology (which does go well with the oral tradition), or they will be constantly updating their book technology (along with all other technology), similar to the way many modern people go from one model of smart phone to the next every couple of months even though the device is still perfectly usable. This could lead to the problem of transcribing old media to new tech, and if neglected leading to "cultural amnesia" etc. etc. If I would need to create a book-like object with today's technology to last a few thousand years at least, I would look at some fibre technology (polymer, glass or carbon), which would be woven or matted into sheets and printed with a similar material with a contrasting color. But even these may be prone to deterioration because of surface damage (water and other fluids in nicks on glass surfaces are known to weaken the material below - and are used when cutting glass because of this). Glass and carbon (fibres) are often coated with polymer coatings so as to protect the surfaces to increase longevity. 

The crystal structure in the material being aligned in a certain way. Cooling your heated iron inside a magnetic field will align it to the field and retain that alignment once cooled (hence making it a permanent magnet). Or as in your example, break a previously strong alignment if the new magnetic field in which it cools is comparably weak, i.e. the earth's magnetic field. (Stroking an object repeatedly with a permanent magnet might also tend to align crystals, although the final effect will be much weaker.) Also, striking an object (with e.g. a hammer) can also weaken an alignment of the crystal structure. Some materials conduct magnetic field lines better than other materials (e.g. laminated transformer core vs. air), even if not especially aligned.
