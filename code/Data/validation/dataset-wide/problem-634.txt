A tube can usually fit a range of different tire sizes, because the tube can stretch a bit when it is being inflated. The range of tire sizes is written on the package that you see at the store. Since your tire is 26"x1.5", you need to find a tube that is labelled as being appropriate for a 26" (diameter) tire and a width range that includes 1.5". For example, look at this picture: 

I would start out by checking all the bearings and adjusting them. In my (limited) experience with cheap bikes, the people that assemble them don't care at all if they do it right. I've seen wheel bearings that were way too tight, so when you lift the wheel off the ground and spin it, it stops quickly. This means that when people ride the bikes, the bearings wear out quickly. Same thing for the headset (steering bearings), although probably not as critical, but easier to adjust. 

$URL$ That particular type is attached on either side such that you can open it without having the entire strap coming off the bike. Both ends are a plain nylon strap, and the middle section is stretchy. I've used these for motorcycle luggage and I liked them. 

From what I've read about the Alfine 11 and 8, the lowest ratio is about the same, but the Alfine 11 has a greater highest ratio. So you could use an Alfine 11 and a smaller front chainring. Then your top gear would remain about the same, and your lowest gear would get lower. Try this site for comparing gear ratios, I have found it to be extremely useful: $URL$ This link will take you to a comparison of Alfine 8 + 39T and Alfine 11 + 33T: $URL$ 

Among other things, the label says 26x1.5/2.20. This means that it's intended for 26" tires where the width is between 1.5" and 2.2". So this one would work for you. I hope this helps in deciphering the labels if you go to a bike store. A previous answer mentioned the two different kinds of valves; this is important. You just have to look at the valve on the old tube that you want to replace and figure out if it's Schrader or Presta. Presta valves look like this: And Schrader valves look like this: If you want to buy it online, here are two that would work: 

Tires can make a significant different in terms of comfort, especially on uneven roads. If you're comparing two different bikes, ask what is the largest tire that either one can handle. I used to have a road bike where some 25mm tires rubbed on the front derailleur clamp (a tire labelled "25mm" is not always 25mm wide). With that bike I didn't have a choice - 25mm or 23mm tires was all I could use. Those narrow tires require high pressure and are uncomfortable. Now I have a cyclocross bike that can use tires up to 40mm, and I'm currently running 35mm Schwalbe Kojak tires. It rolls as fast as any other road bike (I ride with a group, and coasting downhill behind other bikes, I can see that my bike isn't slower). But most of the impact and vibration from the road surface is absorbed by the tires. There are some road bikes, such as the Specialized Diverge and the Norco Search, that work with tires up to 32mm (with fenders) or 35mm (without fenders). These are sometimes called "gravel bikes", intended to be rideable on gravel roads. Obviously they also work very well on paved roads. You don't have to use wide tires -- but it's good to have the choice. You can try it out and see if you like it. If you're comparing specs, you probably want the following, based on what you stated as your goals in your question: 

I'm not sure about the term "cross bike", which doesn't seem to be used in English-speaking countries (except as an abbreviation for cyclocross, but that's not what this bike is); perhaps it's what we call a "hybrid bike" (although hybrids usually don't have a suspension fork) Cyclocross bikes are a totally different category. They are intended for racing, and are basically road bikes ('Rennrad' in German) that can accomodate wider tires (usually up to around 40mm, although cyclocross racing only allows up to 33mm). Usually the rider's position is slightly more upright than on a pure road bike. A suspension fork is only useful for bumpy trails with rocks sticking out of the surface. In my experience, they don't absorb tiny bumps (like gravel) or vibration. Unless you are riding on bumpy singletrack trails, a suspension fork doesn't do much. What makes the most difference for comfort is the size of the tires. Wider tires (35mm, or better yet, 40mm) absorb a lot of small bumps and make the ride a lot more comfortable. This is mostly because you can run wider tires at lower pressure, whereas narrow tires need high pressure and tend to feel rock-hard. The tires on the cyclocross bike you linked to are 35mm, which is pretty decent, but 38mm would be better. Maybe that bike can accomodate 38mm or 40mm tires, which would be good. A lot of people are under the impression that some frames have magical properties that allow them to absorb vibration, but in my experience this is just wishful thinking. There may be a difference there, but it is tiny compared to the difference between thin tires and wide tires. Tire pressure makes a much bigger difference, with lower pressure being more comfortable. You also asked about handlebars and lower gears. I used to ride only mountain bikes and have recently started riding a cyclocross bike. The more leaned-over position (lower handlebars) on the cyclocross bike is less comfortable and I'm getting a lot of pain in my shoulders and neck. However, the drop bars allow multiple different positions for my hands, which reduces pain in my hands on long rides compared to my mountain bike. If you ride steep hills, you are going to miss the lower gears of your old bike. Unfortunately, the cyclocross bike you are considering has an 11-28 cassette and a 46-36 crank, which means that the lowest gear is 36/28 = 1.28, while your old bike had a lowest gear of 26/34 = 0.76. That is a huge difference ! The advantage of the cyclocross bike is that the drop handlebars are more comfortable for your hands on long rides (more than 2 hours) and you can go quite a bit faster due to the more aerodynamic position. My mountain bike with slick tires is very similar to your old bike, and I used to go around 16-17mph on that bike. With my cyclocross bike, I can usually go 19-21mph with similar effort. I'm just hoping that the pain in the shoulders and neck will go away as I get more used to this bike. Bottom line: if you really enjoyed your old 'cross' bike and are concerned with comfort, then a cyclocross bike is probably not a good choice for you. 

These days I use a different bike with Shimano M-520 pedals, but I still use the M038 shoes for commuting occasionally. 

Stems come in a wide range of lengths (45-130mm), and they are generally fairly cheap (starting around $20, and generally around $50). It is very easy to remove the existing stem and install a different one. So I think it is worthwhile to get the shortest reasonable-looking stem you can find and give that a try. Raising the handlebars is not so easy, other than by getting a different stem. Unless there are spacers above your stem on the steerer (the part of the fork that the stem is attached to), in which case it is extremely easy to remove the stem, move the spacer below the stem, and reinstall the stem. It is fairly rare that a bike is sold with extra spacers above the stem. Beware: Sometimes there is a small (5mm) spacer above the stem that has to stay there; its purpose is to prevent the steerer cap from touching the steerer. Another way of raising the handlebars would be getting different handlebars with more rise built into them -- generally the bars would be horizontal in the center, then bend up at an angle, and then flatten out to horizontal at the grips. I don't think this would help much, because the amount of rise you get out of these bars is usually not very large, maybe an inch. Here is something else to consider: I'm 6'5", and for years I was riding a mountain bike that was too small for me, because it was the biggest frame that I could easily find in my price range back when I bough the bike. I got quite used to this bike, so when I finally got a new bike with a larger frame, I felt quite stretched out when reaching for then handlebars. Eventually I got used to that and I doesn't cause any problems even on long rides. But if you've had this bike for several years and it still bugs you, then you should probably get a short stem and see if that makes it feel better.
