Every time I do sports, I sweat really much - no matter whether I play soccer or do some bodyweight exercises. My fitness level is quite good and I don't get out of breath that easyly, but still I am sweating very much every time. What could be the reason for this? Does it mean that I am not as fit as I think I am? Other people, who don't have a fitness level like me don't seem to sweat very much. I am a little confused about what all that means. Should I have my heart circulation system checked or something like that? 

It is never too late to do something for your health. 26 years is not that old and it's a good thing you want to do something for your health and strength. Before you start, you should collect enough informations about what is best to do in your situation. Especially if you want to get super good and have really high ambitions: don't rush into working out. Begin slowly and take one step after another. You should do that at any age if you start something new, otherwise you can easyly be disappointed because you might ask too much of your body very soon and might even lose your ambitions. You can shape and strengthen your body at any age - even if you were 62 you could start doing something, the only difference would be that you had to take smaller steps to avoid you asking to much of your body. 

This is most likely DOMS which is normal. Just ice it, do very light stretching, massage the muscles gently and rest. Symptoms should get better and you should be feeling fine in a day or so. I've had the same thing and occasionally get a client who gets really bad DOMS that they can't fully extend their arms. It sucks but it never ever even comes close to being that bad again. Having said all of that, there is a tiny chance this isn't DOMS so if your condition gets worse or you start getting severe sharp pain then you might want to consult a health professional. 

Total: $19500 I hope now you can see how you are paying like 100000% just because it's a 'resort'. You will get infinitely more value if you bought the services yourself. 2.Their effectiveness is extremely questionable I've only watched several episodes of Heavy but I do remember seeing contestants relapse and go back to their habits the moment they go back home. Gaining dozens of pounds back. This isn't surprising since: Being fat is not the problem, it's a symptom of a problem. 

Calculate your BMR Multiply your BMR by an activity multiplier Add a caloric surplus (500-700 calories for example) to speed up muscle gain 

I will then be focusing on aesthetics (good overall physique) and hence am looking for a program for someone who: 

I want to do the lifts that I enjoy, i.e. Olympic lifting, deadlifts, rows but I also want to concentrate on Aesthetics, hence my question I have Strength goals I want to attain 

I think I need to mostly add in chest and biceps, and hence I put together a program because I couldn't find a suitable one (I can't really program the Olympic part currently because I am just getting used the the movements): The program is 3/4 days a week, alternating Workouts A and B. Workout A: 

To get to my strength goals (see bottom of Spreadsheet) Aesthetics (main goal after reaching strength goals) - arms, shoulder and chest lacking but focus will be on overall aesthetics Learn the Olympic lifts (least important) 

A related question - what SL5x5 accessorises would help to increase muscle mass in a more balanced way? 

I think you are asking will larger muscles and in particular which muscles will make me more attractive to women? This is not really the type of question for this site, as it's so much about opinion. However in my experience, for most woman, yes larger muscles do make men more attractive. But it's a scale and most don't like too much muscle and prefer a more athletic look. In terms of making this your goal - I don't think you should concentrate on one area - instead focus on building overall strength and size. 

I want to get a better mobility and flexibility. Therefore, I am going to start stretching several times a week. However, I don't want to get super skinny because of it. Does the stretching have negative influences on building muscles? Will I lose muscles because of too much stretching? I am a little afraid that could happen. Is my fear justified or am I worrying too much? 

I want to get a better mobility and flexibility. A first goal I have is touching my feet with outstretched legs. Also, I want to be able to lift the outstretched leg into a horizontal position while standing upright. How can I accomplish that? Is it effective to do a stretching workout on one day a week? Or is it better to stretch before a 'normal' workout? I really appreciate any help! 

I don't know about the dimensions of your hypermobility but it should work to do some push ups or similar exercises. You wouldn't even need to go to the gym anymore if you use your own body. Doing push ups requires almost all groups of muscles, so it would help you to gain some muscles and to get the six pack, as well. Of course, you therefore need to eat enough and really work out hard - until the limit. Therefore, you might as well do some crunches or shoulder lifts (you are on your knees and push your arms high - as if you would push a box. You do that four times for each push up you do beforehand. Continue that way until you are not able to do one more series. From that point, you start below the maximum going backwards until you do only one push up and four lifts again). Sounds weird, but don't underestimate it! You know what I mean when you try it. 

Coming to the end of the program in the next couple of months - what would be the best program to move onto after SL5x5? 

I have started Olympic lifting recently and have been looking around the internet for a good accessory routine that makes up for the muscle groups missed, but to no avail. My goals in order are: 

The Routine I have made the outline for a 4 days a week routine. Wondering how (and if) to incorporate the other lifts named in the spreadsheet and what rep schemes to use. Also learning Olympic lifting so the routine incorporates some practice of these movements. Workout Spreadsheet My goals in order: 

My chest and arms seem to be lagging. I have already recently added dips and chins on their respective days. 

Progressing well for the last couple of months on Stronglifts 5x5. (25 y/o, male, 6ft, 80 kg / 176 lbs weight / eatting a surplus of 3200 kcal) 

Progression: If I manage all the sets for an exercise, increase weight by 2.5 kg (5 lbs) next workout. I am looking for advice, recommendations for a suitable routine or criticisms of the one I have suggested. Thank!

You most likely have poor hip mobility and activation. Inside knee pain can be associated more with adductor tightness/hip external rotation, you should be stretching those anyway. Here are the steps to directly improve symptoms when training 

As for you, the best way to solve your problems is by addressing your diet, since nutrition is #1 when it comes to reducing bodyfat. Considering you have visible love handles you should aim to do a cutting diet where you eat at a caloric deficit until you reach the desired bodyfat level. You won't gain a lot of muscle if any during that phase, but that will get you looking the best possible in the shortest amount of time. From there you can transition to a composition shift diet where you either eat at maintenance or at a slight deficit or surplus depending if you want to focus more on the fat loss or muscle gain side. On bodybuilders Advanced bodybuilder's methods do not apply or translate to intermedia lifter since bodybuilders are working with an already large amount of muscle mass, not to mention the large amount of exogenous hormones and drugs that they take -it is impossible for Fabiola to look the way she does without exogenous testosterone for example. Also bodybuilders are focused on how they 'peak'. So a gaining and cutting cycle makes perfect sense. But the average person isn't going to sacrifice 6 months of the year looking bloated and fat in order to look good for 3 weeks. Here's one of my latest clients demonstrating how being leaner makes you look so much bigger even if you are 40lbs lighter overall.
