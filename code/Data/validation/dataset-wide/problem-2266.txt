I was reading the answers at Can I place a Dutch oven directly into/next to a camp fire? and recalling a recent TV episode about forging iron (coal fire) where they said the coals were hotter then the flame. I looked around the web, but am not finding anything that clearly shows what ranges of temperature I might expect to find in a normal campfire. What temperature do different parts of a wood fire produce? 

When firing a flare gun in the air, what is the risk of accidentally starting a forest or wildland fire? Does the flare go out completely before it touches the ground? 

Put a garbage bag in the pack, with the open top of the garbage bag sticking out of the pack. Pour water into the garbage bag one liter at a time, keep track of how many liters of water you use. Use google to convert the number of liters to any measurement you prefer. Empty the water from the garbage bag. 

I heard the phrase "Dry Camping" while watching an American RV show. What does it mean? Are there similar but different terms for the same thing in other parts of the world? 

The type of medication being transported can impact the answer to this question. But for Insulin a really good choice is FRIO cooling case it use evaporation to keep the contents cool. It needs to be someplace it can breath so in the center of your back pack is not a good choice, but an outside pocket might be a good choice. It can be used over and over again and can be recharged on the trail. We have used it extensively for day and week trips. It is not the solution for all meds, so as suggested in the FAQ check with a medical professional about the requirements of your specific medication. 

Comments at a recent question How many tea light candles are needed to equal the heat output of a person? suggest that burning a candle can produce water vaper that masses twice as much as the candle 

A black bear can climb a tree, faster than I can. In fact from the time we became aware of each other, I could not have climbed 20 feet up the tree nearest me. If I had stepped in front of the tree, and that bear had decided to climb my tree he would have gone right up me and then the trunk of the tree. 

In most parts of the world going through a working train tunnel on foot is illegal, in all parts of the world it verges on suicidal. I can imagine there are places in the world where, there are no other reasonable options. In this case, in addition to common sense items required for walking in a dark tunnel. 

Staple the screen to the wood cutout out, Notice the washer that will be used to manage the center hole for rope. 

Unless you are building a bridge you don't. If you don't have the tools to cut it down you don't have the tools to do anything with it once it is down. You are converting it from a big living standing tree to a big dead laying down tree. Neither of which you have the tools to modify. The only scenario where this adds any value to your life is if your life depends on crossing a river and you can make the tree fall across the river or gorge. Which would require a tree close to the river that is tall enough to span the gap. As pointed out in Erik's answer even when the tree falls it may or may not fall according to your plans. Once it hits the ground it going to bounce and the bottom of the tree may end up several feet from the stump, which could be over the edge of the gap you are trying to span. All of the above aside, it takes a lot of fuel and a lot of time to actually burn through a tree. Back in my homesteading days, there was a large stump in my front yard. I had a chainsaw, pick, axe and endless supply of scrap wood from a local mill. The stump was about 8 or 10 feet tall, and 6 or 8 feet wide. An old growth Douglas Fir. 

So how and/or why should you twist or not twist a tick? A ticks mouth parts have barbs, these attach inside the patients body making it difficult for the tick to be dislodged. While there is always a risk of leaving part of the mouth behind the correct technique for the tool will increase the chances of removing the tick without harm. 

I have searched and it appears the old style old style DePersia Bailer is no longer made, the only source for replacement parts are salvage if you can find them. Several options exist for entire replacement bailers made of plastic. It appears (not conclusive) parts from the new style plastic one WILL NOT work in the old metal ones. I sailed sunfish all summer, without using the self bailer feature once. I am looking for plug that I can use in the place of the bailer plug. I measured the plug hole, it seems to be about 1 inch or 7/8 of inch. I tried using a 1 inch snap lock drain plug, it is slightly to big. The only other size of this I found was 1/2 inch. I am not sure nor do I have the tools to measure the exact size of the opening nor thread count. 

The sunfish is a small sailboat with a lateen sail. Realistically you can not raise the sail while in it. Usually raising and lower the sail is done at shore. It is occasionally necessary to paddle the sunfish, due to lack of wind and/or obstacles. The spars on the sail are about the same 14 feet (4.2 meters) as the boat is long, and need to rest down the center of the boat when down. Pretty much this means if you are paddling a sunfish the sail is up, you are becalmed (or in irons, heading into the wind) and sail flowing directly down the center line of the boat, with any slight side breeze making the lower spar (like a boom) push against you (or bang you in the head). It is easy enough to raise the spar and put it to the other side. but it is not effective for long. I have been river sailing and sometimes need to move upstream past a wind block, so need to paddle for some distance. I am looking for a solution that will allow me to paddle for 10 or 15 minutes safely. I can add more pictures later if needed. Leave a comment if not clear 

It is important to notice that the CDC recommends fine tipped tweezers, not the wider version that are often used for pulling splinters or plucking eye brows. When wide tipped tweezers and/or fingers used to pull ticks, there is higher risk of causing injury to the patient by leaving parts of the tick or its gut contents behind. Well what about tools designed to be twisted, as recommended in this answer or in the image below? 

Unless you sever the spinal column near the top of the body there is no body injury that can be done with a knife that is going to result in instant death/disablement of any animal. Any injury that does not completely disable the animals neurological system is going to be dependent on the animal bleeding to the point that they become unconscious. Even if your head is completely removed from your body your brain can function for up to 15 seconds. Best case scenario of a human with a knife is to stop the heart or completely sever the carotid arteries supplying blood to the brain. 15 seconds in close proximity to an injured bear is likely to be an experience that last the rest of your life. You can find occasional reference of 'Bear against Man with Knife' where the Man lives and the Bear does not. But this is a scenario of last resort. 

So the answer to your question, is that it probably flew there, as part of its normal migration. It was cold and it stopped to rest sunning on a rock. 

bullet formatting is abnormal below not sure why, but putting in the line above fixed it, will re-address when text additions are completed. 

There are some great answers here that helped me make my decision. Making the final decision becomes personal choice. There are several options, with some more heavily weighted to certain needs. 

Most of the people I see standing in water fishing are wearing hip waders or chest waders essentially really tall rubber boots. They are not getting wet, they are getting farther from shore, and closer to the fish. They are not standing on the shore, for all the same reasons a person in a boat is not standing on shore. Getting closer to the deeper water where the bigger fish are. While you can't get as far in waders as you can in a boat, waders cost much less then a boat, and are easier to transport from home to the water then a boat. Waders will also allow you move around in water that it is to shallow or rocky for a boat. In the image below the man is wearing chest waders. The stream is to small to navigate by boat. It would be impossible to fish from shore on the far side. A bit farther down stream it would be impossible to fish from the near side shore. With the waders on he can travel up and down stream, get to where the fish are without getting cold and wet. 

I need a new mainsheet (the rope that controls the boom on the main sail) for my sunfish. Many of the online sailboat stores, are selling 8mm FSE Orion for the job. My local Hardware store does not offer this type of rope, but does have Blue Hawk 0.375-in Braided Polypropylene Rope (By-the-Foot), 7/16-in x 100-ft Braided Nylon Rope & 0.375-in x 25-ft Braided Polypropylene Rope All of these braided ropes seem fairly comparable to the rope at the online boat stores. 

I am looking for wildlife viewing areas that are open to manually powered boats (i.e. Canoe) in areas within a few hours drive of Pittsburgh PA. Criteria: 

We use Coghlan's Camp Soap when camping, it is available in handy containers at most stores that have any amount of outdoor supplies. But we can only find it in the 4oz bottle, we would like to be able to refill the bottle from a larger container or make our own. We know reqular dish soap is not the same as camp soap. How can we make our own camp soap that is going to perform like the product we are used to? Clarify: 

My vehicle has broken down in the middle of a desert, I have some tools but I am out of water. I have the ability to make a fire. I know that drinking antifreeze is fatal, but I am wondering if I can distill drinkable water from the antifreeze or any of the other fluids in the car. I am also aware that automotive batteries are usually refilled with distilled water. Automotive Fluids.
