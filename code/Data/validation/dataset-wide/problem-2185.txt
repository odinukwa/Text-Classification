It makes sense to give 2 weeks notice. That is standard US business practice. You can request the use of your remaining holiday. That request may or may not be granted. Some companies use the notice period to transition your work to others. Other companies would be happier not to see you in the office at all. 

In most shops where I have worked, estimates are an essential portion of the SDLC. If your shop is like that, then there would be no way for you to decline to provide estimates when asked. 

It is clearly a valid concern. Many companies don't care what you do in your own time, but some do. You said yourself you have experience with two companies who had different views on freelancing - one where " there is no problem" and one where you "were not allowed to work as a freelancer outside of the organisation". So if you intend to keep freelancing, then it only makes sense to include a mention of your current freelancing in your resume as a signal to those companies who wouldn't allow it. Clearly, you don't want a job with those companies anyway. And if you intend to stop freelancing anyway, or would be willing to drop it, then omit the freelancing from your resume. That way you avoid unnecessary worries by the hiring manager. (I'm assuming here that if a reference check with your current company talks about your freelancing, that they would be fine with it and that they would say that it never took away from your great work at their company.) 

It certainly makes sense to include all coursework that is relevant to the specifics of the internship, as long as it is expected to be completed before the internship begins. You should however indicate that this work is planned, to distinguish it from completed work. Something like: 

Almost certainly not. But if you really need to be sure, you'll need to consult an attorney. Otherwise, try to shake it off. While at best ham-handed, and at worst somewhat cruel, it's quite possible that your boss was just trying to make conversation, and doing a bad job of it. It's awkward for everyone on both sides when someone comes back after a lengthy absence. Hopefully this will all subside quickly and you will be back in the flow with your work. 

CVs/Resumes are meant to convey your background and capabilities to a potential employer. The style of your CV is far less important than the contents. Still, there are a few cases where more fanciful/artistic CVs could be a help, rather than a hindrance. If you are applying for a position in a company where creativity is the most important attribute in the job, then it's possible for a "creative" CV to be helpful. Color, format, images - all could be tweaked for a positive impression and to stand out above the crowd. However, those types of jobs, and those types of employers are few compared to the vast majority. And even then, many companies require that CVs are submitted electronically to a system which might strip out all the "creative" attributes anyway. If you are applying to a University for a job, and it's math-related, it doesn't sound as if this is the type of creative position/employer who would respond positively to a "creative" CV. Only you can be the judge of that. 

There's no real way to know for sure until you are in the job. But, based on my experience, large companies all have formal processes for generating a requisition to hire a new employee, get budget approvals, and handle the hiring process. Thus, others beside the hiring manager know and have approved of your hire. To me, there seems to be little obvious risk here. 

No. It's not unethical to ask. You are doing the work for school credits and the promise of eventual pay. You are getting compensated. The location owners would likely get nothing out of it if not for donations. But it's also not unethical for you to decide that you don't wish to donate. If you can't (or would rather not) spare any change, then don't. 

Yes, you should accept the request. The whole point of people sending you this "meeting request" is to put it on your calendar. That way, whenever you look, you'll see that they are out. This is becoming a reasonably common practice in many shops, including mine. With small teams, it seems to work well. 

Not directly. Instead, make sure your own work is under control such that you can take on an additional burden if you are asked. Your boss will be the one to decide how to handle her absence. That might include hiring a temp, a replacement, spreading the work around, or simply having the department do less for a while. It might involve you at some point or it might not. You don't know for sure if she is pregnant. If she is, you don't know to whom she has confided or if she even has. You don't know when she would leave. You don't know when she would return or if she would return. And you don't know how your boss would choose to handle things. Thus, you cannot ask her. And you cannot do much of anything other than wait and see. 

No. Depending on a single customer is very, very risky for obvious reasons. Most businesses avoid that situation. While it may be unavoidable for young companies, most try hard to change the situation as soon as they can. 

Since you haven't signed the offer, then you can still discuss the details, and perhaps have them changed. It's unfortunate that you have already negotiated to the point where you got an offer letter with a 7 day turnaround period. Better would be to have negotiated your desired salary first. But it's still possible to continue the negotiation up until the point where you sign the offer. Don't wait. Contact HR and tell them that after thinking about it more, you believe the offer is too low. Be prepared to give reasons why you feel that way. And be prepared to explain why you didn't give those reasons earlier in the negotiations. 

Yes you could be affected. If it gets out that you are supporting a lawsuit, there could be repercussions. Perhaps not overt, but the company may trust you less or even try to find a way to retaliate. And if you tip off your employer, the coworker may be very resentful and might try to get back at you. Depending on your feelings about the reasons behind the potential lawsuit, you might still choose to be involved. But you want to make that decision with your eyes open. 

It's far worse to wait until the time of the appointment. When I schedule an interview, I have to block time out of my calendar, and often time out of others' calendars as well. When a candidate is a no-show, or cancels right at the last minute, that's a huge red flag (and often gets them crossed off the list immediately). Don't wait. Call now and reschedule. Be apologetic and hope for the best. 

Yes, you should attempt to send your additional information now. Mistakes happen. Submission forms vary at each company. It's hard to remember the details for each. Just send you information, indicate that you forgot to attach it to your original submission, and hope for the best. (If this causes the company to think you are incompetent, then omitting the information would likely do the same. I suspect you are over-thinking this a bit.) 

As I understand it, different companies offer different rewards. While I don't know any that offer a supply of salad dressing, I do know some that offer money, and some that offer company swag. Where I currently work, they have a "Wellness Program", championed by HR. You attain "bonus points" for certain activities deemed "healthy" by the company. For example, if you have an annual physical, you get 50 points. If you have your biometric screening performed (BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc), you get 125 points. And so on, and so on. Once you get 300 points, you are given $250. And your spouse can earn $250 the same way. From an HR point of view, this improves the health of the company, is generally viewed as a "nice thing to do for employees", leads to a reduction in absences, and perhaps a future reduction in insurance premiums. I don't know the participation rate, although I'm sure it's less than 50%. 

I'm not sure how much of an answer you can get for this question. You certainly should ask for details concerning what kinds of reimbursement of expenses you will get. And you can always ask (politely) for anything. Perhaps something like, "Since it will be a burden to be away from home so many days, I'd like to be reimbursed for entertainment, clothing, (and whatever else you feel you should get)". If the company has a travel policy, you can usually get your hands on that and all the details will be spelled out. But absent that, just ask nicely and see what happends. Good luck! 

If you are laid off in the US, and don't have any specific language in your contract, and don't have any specific language in your severance agreement, I don't believe employers should attempt to tell you who you can or can not work for. In 40+ years of working, I've never seen nor heard of a case where any company could dictate your new employer unless you had already signed an agreement limiting your choices. I'd love to see a case that contradicts this. A few years back, I spoke about this with the CEO of one of the largest employers in my state. It was in regard to an employee who had actually signed a non-compete agreement, quit our company, and went to a competitor. The CEO told me that while the signed non-compete gave them the right to sue, in my state he'd never seen a case where the state penalized the former employer for that action, so he wasn't going to pursue it. For me, I'd feel bound by a non-compete agreement. But if I hadn't signed a non-compete, I would not feel bound, and would contest any attempt to restrict my employment. Remember, anyone can attempt to sue you for anything (or otherwise attempt to restrict you from anything). That doesn't mean they have a right (legal or otherwise). 

Ugh. A company that has to hire an outsider to establish "values" means they never had any to begin with. Always a bad sign. 

Promotions and raises don't necessarily have a direct correlation. In some companies for some roles, you could get promoted without getting a raise at all. In other companies or for other roles, a promotion would automatically result in a very large raise completely aside from any merit raise you may deserve. 

I have talked to my boss in similar cases and asked what was the process for collecting information on technical debt at this company. Often, there is either a bug-tracking system, or a system to collect "Stories" or such. Once I learned the expected process, I followed it. 

Every company where I have worked was able to state the percent of your salary you were eligible for, as a bonus. If that information isn't given to you when salary and benefits are discussed prior to an offer letter, then you should certainly ask. 

IMHO, being ready and able to give annual raises to those who deserve them is just the cost of running a business. If you don't want to give raises even though warranted, then your alternative is to continually hire replacements for workers who will inevitably leave after a year or two. My suggestion would be to give this good, trained worker a raise. You can base the size of the raise to match what the market will bear. Or you can offer less along with some equity in the startup. If you choose to give no raise at all, or a below-market raise, then start getting prepared to hire and train a replacement. 

Unless you are a high-level executive or unless your contract states otherwise, two weeks is indeed the standard notice period at US software startups. The fact that no Android developers or people with Java experience will remain once you depart isn't your fault. Sometimes startups unwisely choose not to have backups sufficiently trained. You should plan for how you will choose to react if your current employer asks for more time to find and train a replacement. But you are under no obligation to give them more time. It's always possible that a bitter ex-employer will choose not to give you a good reference, but that can happen no matter how much notice you provide. If you want to give more than the standard notice you can. But the standard is indeed two weeks. 

You were specifically tasked with making an important call on a Saturday, with an important client, after being put on high alert - and you somehow forgot to do it. You indicate that the client was furious, and that this was a grave situation. You agree that you should be punished. The choice of punishment seems silly to me, but your boss obviously chose a punishment that got to you. Somehow, your boss knew that this would get your attention, and it clearly has. To me, it appears that your boss has lost some confidence in you, and wants to "shock" you back into paying the kind of attention that earned you mistake-free, star quality work for 9 months. In some cases, if your boss didn't think you could be shocked into doing better, you'd have been fired. Perhaps your boss thought you are worth saving. You earn confidence back by paying more attention and not making mistakes - not by passive-aggressive slowdowns, and certainly not by quitting. You could complain to your boss about how mean it is to deprive you of your music - but this seems rather immature, and less than professional. Or, you could just gather your wits, accept your punishment, stop your slowdowns, work hard, and let it ride for a while. After a few weeks, you could talk with your boss, admit your mistake, and based on your recent professional demeanor and continued hard work ask if you can go back to wearing headphones. I'm guessing after a cooldown period like this, both sides could get back to the prior working relationship.
