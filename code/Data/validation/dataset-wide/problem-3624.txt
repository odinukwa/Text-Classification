Why are my legs cramping in cold weather the day that I work them out? Recently, after I workout my legs, usually pretty intense workouts that range from high intensity to low rep high weight, they will start to cramp if I am outside in cold weather. Yesterday was particularly bad after a particularly intense leg workout. I got home, stepped out of my car, the temperature was probably around 28F and my quads immediately cramped up. I had to practically crawl to my house and then sit on the floor until they warmed up. From past experience, if I stretch them out when this happens, my hamstrings will start to cramp and then it's just a vicious cycle of leg cramps. Also, I usually eat two bananas every day. How can I prevent this from happeneing in the future? Edit So far, the general consensus seems to be drink more water. I should have stated in the question originally that that should not be the issue because I drink at least a gallon of water every day. 

Of course, creatine is always an option. It is one of the most widely used supplements and there is plenty of research out there confirming its benefits for improving recovery, thus allowing you to complete more reps to improve strength. You should definitely do a lot of research before considering creatine though because there is a lot of information needed before taking it. I'd recommend reading a "beginner's guide" or something similar. Something like this. Recommended Supplements - 

In my opinion the importance of carbs (post workout) is generally overlooked. If you read this article and many others like it, it explains that combining carbohydrates and protein (in a 4:1 ratio) within 30 minutes of exercising is very important. Why? 

Edit: Here is an example of some of the things I came across. It seems that a lot of people say things like "Don't workout longer than an hour." I want to know why, and just blaming it on overtraining is not a sufficient answer. This article says this: 

I don't know quite as much about this question other than what seems like common sense. The answer is really in the question. Compound workouts are great for hitting multiple different muscles but in order to increase mass and definition you have to isolate different parts of those muscles which aren't necessarily worked by the compound exercises. Bench press does not work your outer chest muscles nearly as much as isolating them with flys. Still using chest as an example, your chest will not look proportional or very good in general if you only did flat bench press. Incline bench works the top of your chest while decline works the bottom. This is all directly relatable to other muscle groups as well and does not just apply to chest workouts. In my opinion and I think most people would agree, bodybuilding is about appearance - vascularity, definition, symmetry, striations, mass etc. Strength training is simply about getting stronger. The two are very different so don't be surprised that BB requires isolation workouts as well as compound workouts. 

Meaning: Old people are found to have a higher body fat percentage (statistically) for the same skinfold thickness, but that's not true for all old people (hence statistically). Regarding the shifting ideals: I can't find it anywhere right now but I read some where that with age a higher body fat percentage is found to be healthier. I think it was on a discussion on bmi where they found that a the bmi limits don't hold for old people and that the ideal bmi for them should be higher (independent of the point that bmi is a crappy measurement). 

I have no idea of cricket (other than some scenes from British movies that didn't help me in any way understanding the rules) and I'm not sure what a bowler does so I don't know how these translate but I do some gripping exercises for martial arts and use basically homemade tools for this. The easiest to build is a tennis ball. I have one in my office and one at home and just squeeze them. It's the same principle as grippers (spring loaded) but much cheaper. The other thing I often use is a wrist roller. It's easy to construct since it's one a weight on a string on a stick. So what you do with it is you hold the stick and twist it to wrap the string around the handle to bring the weight up and down. That's basically a wrist exercise but also works hands and fingers. An other thing that seems to be popular for grip strength are clubs but I haven't tried that so I can't tell you much about them. What also works for pinching strength is just grip some weight with your pinched fingers so for example grab a filled bottle of water or a dumbbell plate with you fingers by the rim but in a way that you only hold it by pinching you fingers (so no hooking the tip of fingers under a rim or anything) and hold it for a while. Not sure if that helps or if the Sri Lankan army does any of this. 

I find strict nutrition and exercise plans not very helpful because they are often very bias toward the personality of those who give them. That's nothing bad but sometimes it can get somewhat religious (don't touch processed food it's the devil work). The best approach for loosing weight I have found till now is "The Hacker's diet" by John Walker. It's available for free with everything you need provided. I used some of the approaches to drop 20kg over 1 year (while eating all kinds of stuff basilmir would send me to hell for ^^). A short summary of that approach: The premise is the known fact that to loose weight your body needs to use up more energy than it gets from the food you eat. So you can either reduce what you eat and try to burn more. By a simple comparison of effort it's much easier to reduce food than to try to burn enough calories to drop weight ("I ran @4mph for 30 mins burning 220 calories in tread mills" thats less than 5 oreos provide for). The only way to make sure you eat less than you need is to measure it. Calorie counting is tedious and calories are also not a very good measure for food (my personal opinion). So the approach of the hackers diet is to measure the thing you want change so the basic weight control measure is to check your weight regularly and act accordingly. To sports: Sports are great to make you feel better, probably live longer and maybe make your overall life easier (stairs) but not for loosing weight (see comparison above). So I would agree with basilmir on that. Play sports you like, use it to meet new people, join a club do it for fun. There is no use in running to an expensive gym in order to loose weight when you don't change your diet or just don't go because you don't like it. If you don't want to go anywhere to do sports there is a simplified version of the 5BX program in the hacker's diet which I didn't do (I played sports) but it's a very time friendly program (10-15min per day) with an included progression and has been used by the RCAF from 1961-2008. Summary: Exercise can help you feel better about your body and help you loose weight but it's not key to loosing weight. From my experience it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you eat less energy than your body needs (provided your diet includes all nutrients you need). @basilmir I agree with most of what you said I just think dogmatic rule hurt more than they help. If I don't like to eat something why should I spend my precious time on this earth forcing it down my throat just because someone said it's healthy? And why when I sometimes eat something that tastes good but is condemned as unhealthy should I feel bad? Where is the fun in that? 

Personally, I don't think BCAAs are worth the small, if any, boost in performance. According to examine.com: 

What benefits, if any, does Glutamine have on an experienced athlete? Given that the athlete has a balanced diet. In past research, mostly based on examine.com, I have come to the conclusion that Glutamine does not have any significant benefits on exercise performance on an individual. Given that this individual is an experienced, healthy athlete who has a balanced diet. Examine.com's Glutamine Article Recently though I was told thought that this is not true. The person that told me I was incorrect was basing his argument on information he had read in a textbook on nutrition. I have never been able to get a completely confident answer. That being said, I am looking for answers that are backed by scientific information and verified and unbiased sources. Meaning, I am not looking for the first article on Glutamine from bodybuilding.com. 

How can I increase bicep width? I am happy with my bicep peak, but I am having trouble increasing the width of my biceps. My arms look rather big from the side but when you look at them head on they are quite narrow/skinny. I have heard that hammer curls improve width, but I haven't seen much of an improvement in the last couple of months. Currently, I work arms once a week (as I do every muscle group) on Tuesdays. My routine usually consists of 3 bicep workouts followed by 3 tricep workouts. I don't have a set routine because I like to switch it up and hit different workouts each week. I will give a sample workout below, again, this is different each week. 

Casein can help refuel your body when you go for long periods without food (i.e. when you are sleeping). Recommended Supplements - 

It is definitely not bad for someone to drink a protein shake without working out. It is very similar to eating a chicken breast that has 35 grams of protein in it. 35 grams of protein is 35 grams of protein, no matter where you get it from. Some proteins are different, such as casein (slow release) and whey (quick release), but it is still protein. As Freakyuser said in his comment, if your diet is good enough you shouldn't need the shake. In your case though it sounds like you are simply using it as a meal replacement, which is totally fine. EDIT: This is all dependent on the rest of your diet. 

Wall Sits A good stationary workout (that shouldn't cause any knee pain) would be wall sits. These are definitely not easy and will work quads. 

Edit after clarification: I don't know of any tool that does provide resistance in a flicking direction. The two options I can think of to add resistance in an outward direction are either to do that motion against a rubber band (which will most likely fly off into your face if you don't find a way to attach it somehow so it can't get off your fingers (maybe sew it to an old glove)). Or do the movement in something like a bowl of sand (wearing gloves if you don't also want to condition your skin) or something similar (high viscosity liquid or something) to add resistance to the movement. Another edit: Found a few links on the extension topic: Here is one mentioning a commercial tool for this kind of excercise and showing how to replace it with a piece of thera-band. This one shows an easy way to fix a rubber band for resistance. And here is one realy adding anything new but mentioning the sand bowl method which was just a wild stab in the dark. I tried the thera band thing and I have to say I have very unbalanced gripping and extension strength... 

Let's take a look at what this method does: What you measure is the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer on your suprailliac. That does not give you your total body fat percentage directly because body fat distribution varies from person to person. So what you need is an estimate of your total body fat percentage in relation to the fat on your suprailliac. To do this statistical models are used. So a group of people has these measures taken and their body fat percentage measured (water weighting, x-ray, etc) and the most likely formula of the relation between the measured quantity and body fat is searched (simplified description). These models which relate skinfold thickness to body fat percentage often include more variables than just one skinfold. Most are sex specific, some take up to 7 skinfolds, bmi, hight, waist circumference, and some, like the Accumeasure chart, use age as an influence on body fat distribution. Note that all of these estimates are (meaning should be) based on statistics thus these estimates never will fit all. So how good they are depends on how specific the group was the estimates are based on and how well you fit into it. So to sum up: The idea is to relate an easy measurable quantity (skinfold thickness) to a hidden one (body fat percentage). This relation is most likely unique to each person depending on genetics and lifestyle. So the best that can be done is to gather enough samples to allow a statical estimation of the relation which will give an error depending on the statistics you gathered and the person that is measured. And now to the wikipedia:
