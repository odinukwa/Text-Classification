Not to be mean about it, but learning new things is kind of what programmers do for a living. I understand that this is probably miles out of you comfort zone but if your employer is really okay with you taking the time to ramp up to understanding the technology, I would, if I were you, use this as a learning opportunity. The chances are good that somewhere down the line you will be tasked with utilizing ASP.NET in some other fashion, be it fixing someone else's code or creating a project on your own with the constraints that for whatever reason it's got to be in .NET. If you really, really feel uncomfortable about this and feel that you have no other recourse but to beg off, I would couch this to your superior in terms that they would understand. If you're not familiar at all with C#/ASP, explain to them that it may take you several weeks to get up to speed on the task, time which may be better utilized on some other project. The big problem here is that if they don't actually have a PHP-based project for you to work on, the best business decision might be to let you go (which is reason #1 why as a programmer, one has to be flexible). 

In the specific case of a job you are contracted out to do, no, it's not appropriate because you should be working out the details of how much you're getting paid with your contractor, not your manager at the job itself. And trust me: you in all probability do not want to know what they are paying the contractor because it's likely to be a lot more than what they're paying you in turn (the premium that gets charged is for peace of mind on the part of the employer - the contractor is essentially leveraging their goodwill and reputation to tell the employer "trust us, this guy knows what they're doing"). In normal circumstances where there isn't a contractor in between you and the location you work at? Sure, you can definitely ask, although I would still recommend that question come towards the end (if you have a multiple round interview, for instance, you may wish to save that for the final round or at least the final round with a manager / HR person). Usually if it's not specifically broached, though, it'll be the first thing brought up if/when they extend you an offer. 

Do you have a contract that you signed? If not, and assuming you're in the States, the whole "two week notice" thing is just a courtesy. If you feel threatened at work or if you are skeptical that you're going to get paid, by all means don't go in to work. If this person has that kind of reputation otherwise, perhaps you can have the recruiter verify your employment instead if that becomes an issue? Otherwise, it doesn't sound like you have a particularly large amount to lose in your situation by no-showing your final week, and potentially a pretty decent amount to lose. As a side note, you appear to have figured this out for yourself approximately one step too late but you always want to make sure that you've cleaned out any personal data or vital information from your workplace (meaning your email but also potentially the actual desk that you sit at) before you provide notice because unfortunately sometimes bosses react like this. This doesn't mean you have to literally pack up in anticipation of stuff, but if you're keeping your 15 year Rolex at your desk and you 100% want to keep it, make sure you tuck that away before you hand your letter over to your boss. 

Outside of those 3 reasons, there really isn't a reason to send a follow-up letter. Again, they've already interviewed you and all you can really do from here is lower your chances of getting that job. I know it sucks to be in a position where you think you can do a really great job somewhere but you muffed the interview - been there, done that - but the most you can do at this point is use the situation as a learning experience. 

Pretty much any time you make a demand from your employer, I feel that it needs to be made from a position of strength. I don't mean that you ought to actually go out and find another gig before you approach your boss about this but you should at least have a good grasp of exactly how much you're underpaid at the moment (it sounds like you do) and the nature of the job market for your position. It is always possible that your boss is going to either give you an excuse to try to put it off for 6 months or flat out say "no, you're not going to get that". That being said, I'm a strong believer in the power of communication. It's always possible, particularly in a smaller company, that the company forgot about this. As always, even with something like this, I think it's helpful to talk about this with "I" rather than "you" statements ("As a condition to my taking this job, I was offered stock options with this company which, according to my calculations ought to have happened several months ago. I see this company going places and it's causing me some angst not being able to get in on the 'ground floor', so to speak"), as I think it's helpful in any situation, but I would err on the side of making sure they understand your position here. All that being said, one thing I would not do in your situation is make this into an ultimatum. First and foremost, it's just not necessary. If you go in to your boss's office and let them know that you are not receiving promised remunerations, they have to understand that the consequences of not providing those is losing you as an employee. In fact, it's even better this way because if they turn you down, you don't necessarily have to give them notice until you actually find that other job. On top of that, what would the endgame be of that ultimatum? Sure, ideally you get your vesting options, but you also open up a situation within the company wherein you have to threaten to quit to get your way. That's not the kind of environment I would have fun working at and I can't imagine it would be great for many other people either. The "I'm not here to make friends" bit doesn't need to be anywhere near this either. If your employers are paying you, they understand this already. So in summary: 

While I am admittedly a little bit skeptical that "lying" is the correct choice of words here, I feel like I need to weigh in with the option that you ought to use your probationary period on the guy. It is entirely possible that you are right, he just plain doesn't know what he's doing, and you need to cut bait. That ought to be almost as obvious in 6 months' time as it is now. On the other hand, if this person worked with a product for several years but has not worked with it in a while, it may take them a while to get up to snuff. In any case, there's no point, either, in providing this person with the full 6 months to grant themselves enough rope to hang themselves with. Once you've made a determination one way or the other, feel free to act on it. Some guys need a bit of time to get started. Some guys never do get it. If this is a developer job (and from checking on Joe's link, it sounds like it might be) it's not out of the ordinary at all to actually use the probationary period to determine if a person is up to snuff (then again, it's not out of the ordinary to have 10 interviews and zero qualified candidates, so there is that as well).
