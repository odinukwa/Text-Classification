Well designed front pockets can solve this issue There is a small New Zealand company called Aarn that has been working with a respected ergonomics lab to offer an alternative. By adding pockets to the front using an integrated suspension system, you can counterbalance the load and regain a balanced and natural walking posture. Here are the forces at play, as measured in the lab: 

It's great that you're being so supportive, but there's a limit to what you can do to help. Thru-hiking is all about self-reliance, so your mother really has to develop her own skills and mental resilience. It sounds as though you're already on top of your main role, which is to hold the fort in terms of managing her finances and resupply. To put your mind at rest, she won't be in "natural solitary for 6 months". The AT is a popular trail and highly sociable. If she wants company she won't have any trouble finding it. With the exception of the 100 Mile Wilderness, it's also mainly near to population centres, so she can be in touch with family and friends on a regular basis. And as you seem so concerned for her safety, it might be a good idea for her to carry a Garmin inReach Satellite Communicator so you can track her progress and exchange messages when there's no cellphone reception. It also acts as an emergency beacon if she ever needs help from Search and Rescue - this is a big deal for solo hikers and will greatly enhance her safety. As you say, there's no shortage of online videos and advice, so she should be well briefed. It's the world's most vlogged trail! Though from what you say, her experience is quite limited for such a big project. From what I've seen, many US thru-hikers set out under-prepared in terms of basic back-country skills. For your own peace of mind, you might want to double-check that she is up to speed in the key areas that people tend to neglect: 

Ask the locals! Something missing from the current answers and the first port of call in my opinion, unless you are somewhere very remote. For any mountain with significant difficulties or dangers I would always try to ask a local or two (especially in countries where the mapping is poor). Some suggestions: 

There's really no simple answer to this. Here are some variables that people sometimes overlook... Are the walls sloping or vertical? The first factor to consider is the slope of the inner at your head and feet. In some designs the walls are vertical. But in others the the space can narrow quite sharply with height - add a thick sleeping mattress and suddenly you have much less room than you would expect from the floor plan. On some tents with sloping walls the inner can sag quite badly, especially in damp conditions, so you might need more space to keep if off your face. Some people hate having the inner close to their face, while others don't seem to mind. The thickness and type of your sleeping bag A big winter bag can have considerable loft in the foot-box and the hood, so allow for this in addition to your height. If you're camping in high condensation conditions and you have a down bag, you might want a good margin of safety to prevent the bag from soaking up condensation from the tent outer. Ideally, get advice or try it out If you're buying from a specialist cottage maker, have a chat with them and they will advise you - they may even have larger models for taller customers. If you're buying something mass market try to find a store that will put up a demo for you and try it with the gear you'll be using, bearing in mind that things will often sag more in the outdoors. It's also worth going on the backpacking forums and simply asking people how they are getting on with the tent you're considering. Better safe than sorry... But in general, go for something with a good margin of safety - a tent purchase is an expensive mistake if it doesn't work for you. Don't fret over the odd extra ounce if you have to get something bigger - a tent you don't fit into is a false economy, I think. 

What are the issues? There are two issues here: the siting of official navigation cairns by whoever is responsible for maintaining the trail, and the building of unofficial cairns by visitors. Official cairns For official cairns, attitudes to waymarking vary widely in different countries based on local traditions and conditions. The locals will build and maintain any cairns that are required, and their decisions should be respected. In the UK we are broadly influenced by "Unna's Rules", which emphasise that land should be left in its natural state so far as possible and that walkers should rely on their navigation skills. Even official cairns are kept to a minimum. Unofficial cairns For unofficial cairns, it's not the role of visitors to alter the landscape. In the context of Europe, or of highly trafficked trails anywhere, I can't think of any valid reason for a visitor to build a cairn. These unofficial cairns are becoming a genuine menace here in the UK. In heavily used areas like Ben Nevis and the Lakes, local rangers and volunteers have to remove literally hundreds of cairns a year. They damage the landscape and can be misleading if not well sited. The new fad for stone-balancing isn't helping either - it's important that people dismantle their creations after they've been photographed. Please leave no trace! So to summarise, if you're part of a ranger service or club maintaining a trail, it's more than likely that you will be following well established local guidelines honed through generations of experience. If you are just visiting, please leave well alone and enjoy the landscape as it is. 

I only relax these rules in upmarket hotels and restaurants, and even then I'm careful. The worst experience I've had was when a group of us ate in a fancy salad-bar in Mumbai. It was popular with local Westerners so we thought it would be OK, but boy were we wrong... All this might seem killjoy, but the alternatives are not pleasant as you have discovered. And it can be worse - you can also pick up hep or even cholera. On my first trip to Asia I was studying with the great yogi B K S Iyengar. He spotted me buying street food and pointed out very forcefully that I was being an idiot as I simply wouldn't have the immunity to get away with it. The lesson stuck. In my experience people who try to be cool and go native inevitably end up getting ill - sometimes very ill. So be uncool and stay safe. 

Short answer - if you have to ask, you most certainly shouldn't do it! The Simpson is regarded as one of the ultimate challenges for cross-country drivers. There are no easy routes, and the dangers are significant. You would need a high ground clearance 4WD vehicle, and also a great deal of skill and experience together with detailed research and planning. A solo attempt would simply add to the danger - most people cross in convoy for safety reasons. Access is only allowed at certain times of the year, and expensive permits are required. Newbie climbers shouldn't attempt the north face of the Eiger, and newbie cross-country drivers shouldn't attempt the Simpson! 

While you are at it, ask about any local hazards: afternoon thunderstorms, flash floods, wild animals and the like. If you ask someone who doesn't know, they will often pass you on to someone who does. I've had a lot of luck with this approach over the years. 

And the final issue is the stability of the shoe on your foot. This is a function of the volume of the shoe over your forefoot, and of the design of the lacing system. Individual foot-volume varies widely depending on the height of your arch, etc, and different brands tend to fit different types of foot. It really is worth going to a store that offers a wide selection and properly trained fitters so you can find a brand with a last that suits you. For example, I've never found a Salomon shoe that fits me while Merrell's tend to fit OK. Other people have the opposite experience. You are looking for a fit where your foot doesn't slide forwards when you are facing down a steep slope. ADAPTABILITY FOR DIFFERENT SOCKS, INSOLES ETC If you're going to be using the shoe in a wide range of conditions, you may want to size on the generous side so you can use different sock arrangements or insoles. For example I tend to use a single thin lining sock in the summer, a thicker waterproof sock for severe winter conditions, and a more protective insole when I'm walking on sharp rocks for any distance. To give me this flexibility, I try to buy the largest size that will fit. If the last suits my foot and the lacing system is well designed, I don't have any trouble adapting to all the scenarios I need.

If you stretch yourself in the hills, this is the book for you. A comprehensive guide to training for mountain adventures, and by far the best in its field. BIOGRAPHY I'll take this opportunity to alert people to a classic that's little known outside of Scotland: 

More generally, it seems that Local Authorities are increasingly taking a US-style legally defensive attitude to any risky activity. Increasingly their reflex is simply to ban swimming to cover themselves. So from this perspective the notice may simply be an excuse for a ban. Here's the response of an official to an Outdoor Swimming Society petition for access to a lake: 

Treating clothing so ticks are killed on contact before they can reach your skin, and biting insects are repelled so you can wear more breathable clothing rather than uncomfortable, tight-woven insect-proof fabrics. Preventing bites on your skin. Avoiding the little buggers in the first place 

It's been a total liberation. My feet, knees and hips function as they evolved to function, and I'm experiencing far less fatigue, wear and tear. And I've never had so much as a hot-spot, never mind a blister. Heavy boots are supposed to provide ankle protection, but because they don't allow your power train to function properly I used to experience regular injuries - sometimes quite serious. Walking thousands of miles in more natural shoes, I've never had a problem. And being able to actually feel the ground beneath your feed adds a great deal of enjoyment to walking, at least for me. I wouldn't want to isolate myself from the ground again any more than I'd want to wear chain-mail to make love. Of course wearing light footwear does involve some commitment and a change of attitude. You have to transition carefully and rebuild the natural strength in your feet. You have to step lightly and accurately on difficult ground. You have to lighten your pack. You have to pick the right shoes for the job, or adapt them to the terrain with removable rock-plates. It's all part of a more lightweight approach to moving and living in the mountains. For me there's no turning back. I've walked long distances over tough terrain, and as I've built my strength and skills it's become an integral part of my enjoyment of the hills. 

They are tougher than the OS maps, without the bulk of the lamination. You don't need a map case - just fold and roll and stick them in a pocket. The footpaths are often more complete and accurate - they get on the ground and check them out. It's the same for rocky and marshy ground - they get out there and check the terrain. Subjectively, I find the contouring and shading is clearer - compare the mapping of the Cuillin, for example. They omit details like administrative boundaries that clutter the mapping and are of little interest to walkers. They name the popular climbing crags. They offer maps scaled and centered to show a whole area - eg 1 map for the Lakes, vs 4 for the OS. The Dartmoor map, for example, is more convenient than the two-sided OS Explorer. They offer strip-maps covering many of the National Trails, while you would need multiple OS maps for the same coverage. They offer useful specialist maps - eg large scale summit maps for complex tops and fell running maps for popular races and challenges. The contours are visible using a night-vision red light, while they are pretty much unreadable on the OS map. 

I think that Klara pretty much nailed it. I've been stoveless for a bit now, and I haven't found any hidden gems that people aren't aware of. What I do find is that on longer treks where the food becomes monotonous it pays to buy the best artisan products available, as they are usually a lot tastier than the mass produced stuff. On longer trips a lot depends on where you are, and whether you are re-supplying in supermarkets or in remote village shops. Treks in the UK In the UK I'd carry porridge oats, which are widely available. Soaked overnight they are quite pleasant cold, with powdered milk, nuts, dried fruit, salt and honey. You can do something similar with bulgur wheat, if you can find it. I might also carry oatcakes instead of bread as they are denser and pretty tasty - especially the flavoured ones like cheese. Treks in the Western Alps In the Western Alps resupply can be limited in small villages. But you can always find wonderful local cheeses, salamis and bread. You can often buy these direct from the farmhouse. I stomp on the bread to save volume. In the Germanic areas pumpernickel is dense and easy to carry, if you like the taste. You can always buy chocolate - and in Switzerland it's an art-form. But compared to the UK there's little choice of sweets. After resupply I carry a day's worth of fruit to stave off scurvy! When I start to get too thin I carry olive oil to put on the bread. The problem is that it's sold in large quantities, but people are often kind enough to fill up my little container. Ask in farm shops, cafes, small hotels etc. Be sure to use a bottle with a good seal! 

Letterboxing code of practice Rather sadly it's quite common to find boxes which haven't been re-sealed properly and replaced back in their sheltered cache - so the visitors book is destroyed by damp. Or boxes where someone has stolen the stamp. Please don't spoil other people's enjoyment: it will most likely be a kid that you disappoint. And as others have said, be sensible on the ranges and don't handle anything suspicious. Your chances of encountering dangerous ordinance are very low but there's no need to take risks. Most modern boxes are plastic containers but there a still a few in metal boxes. It's usually pretty obvious what they are from the way they've been hidden. 

The osprey does seem the most likely option. There are only a handful of breeding pairs in North Wales, but they are in your area so it's credible. The wingspan of a small common buzzard starts at around 110cm and a large osprey can reach 170cm, so although they are normally of similar size the wingspan differential is possible. And the osprey has the white chest and narrower wing tip. Here are comparisons in flight and in silhouette: 

I live on the edge of Dartmoor and have some hands-on experience of letterboxing. What is letterboxing? It was reportedly started by James Perrott, a Dartmoor guide who placed a bottle for visitors' cards on a cairn at Cranmere Pool in 1854. Before the modern military tracks this was the most remote point of the moor and a fashionable spot to visit. (The current remote point is Fur Tor - a much more prepossessing spot!). Gradually more boxes appeared at other sites, and as others have said, the hobby has now spread around the world. Boxes are usually hidden under overhangs around the tops of the Dartmoor tors, or in well-known woods and historic sites. They should contain a book for visitor comments, contact details for the maintainer and a stamp (with ink-pad) for your own log book to prove that you've been there. Dedicated letterboxers carry their own stamps for the visitors book along with an ink-pad as a backup. Sometimes people will leave stamped and addressed postcards - the idea is that the next visitor posts it back to them when they get home along with a message. Locals tend to leave them for visitors from farther afield, and I've heard reports of cards being posted back from all around the world.
