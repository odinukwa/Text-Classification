You need to add the word "oriented", in order to assign signs consistently to the intersections, and "compact" so that there will be finitely many intersections. To see the issue for unoriented manifolds, think about $\mathbb{RP}^2$. We have $H_0(\mathbb{RP}^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $H_1(\mathbb{RP}^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$, so cap product would define a bilinear map $\mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2 \to \mathbb{Z}$. Such a map must be zero, but two non-contractible curves in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ meet an odd number of times. (For example, two lines in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ meet at a single point.) After that, nothing is wrong with it. For a compact oriented $n$-fold $X$, Poincare duality gives an isomorphism $H^k(X) \cong H_{n-k}(X)$ so we get a map $$H_{n-a} \times H_{n-b} \cong H^a \times H^b \overset{\cup}{\longrightarrow} H^{a+b} \cong H_{n-a-b}.$$ Tracing through the definitions on a triangulation, one obtains the map you described. As far as I know, it is only important to distinguish cap and cup when one wants to move away from the world of compact oriented manifolds. (Cup makes sense when $X$ isn't a manifold at all!) 

Now, if $n$ is not prime, then there are lots of sets $A$ such that all the $b_k$ are equal. The special case $b=1$ is called a perfect difference set, and they are pretty plentiful. For example, $(0,5,6,9,19)$ is a perfect difference set modulo $21$, giving $$|1+\zeta_{21}^5+\zeta_{21}^6+\zeta_{21}^9+\zeta_{21}^{19}| = \sqrt{5-1} = 2.$$ According to the mathworld link above, there are perfect difference sets modulo $q^2+q+1$ for every perfect power $q$; taking $q=p^2$ we deduce that we can always find $A$ in $\mathbb{Z}/(p^4+p^2+1)$ with absolute value $p$. Based on skimming the results of a quick google search, my impression is that there are lots of methods known for constructing perfect difference sets, but no classification. Probably someone has studied the case $b>1$, but I didn't see it. But even if there were a classification, that wouldn't be a complete answer. Because $1+\zeta+\cdots + \zeta^{n-1}$ is not the minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ for $n$ composite. And I don't see how to control the other solutions that might come up because of this. 

No, this is almost never true. $|\# E(\mathbb{F}_q) -q - 1| \leq 2 \sqrt{q}$. So $\#E(\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) \geq p^2 - 2p +1=(p-1)^2$ and $\#E(\mathbb{F}_p) \leq p + 2 \sqrt{p} +1= (\sqrt{p}+1)^2$. So $\#E(\mathbb{F}_{p^2})/\#E(\mathbb{F}_p) \geq (\sqrt{p}-1)^2$. If $p \geq 5$, this is $>1$. Let's look a little closer at $p=2$ or $p=3$. Let the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius be $T^2-aT+1=(T-\alpha)(T-\beta)$. We have $\#E(\mathbb{F}_p) = (\alpha-1)(\beta-1)$ and $\#E(\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) = (\alpha^2-1)(\beta^2-1)$. So $\#E(\mathbb{F}_{p^2})/\#E(\mathbb{F}_p)=(\alpha+1)(\beta+1) = p+a+1$. So we will succeed if and only if $a=-p$. Such curves do exist for $p=2$, $3$. For $p=2$, consider $y^2+y=x^3+x$. This has $4$ points in the $(x,y)$ plane (namely, $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$) plus the point at infinity, so $\#E(\mathbb{F}_2) = 5$ and $a=-2$. For $p=3$, consider $y^2 = x^3-x+1$, with $6$ points in the $(x,y)$ plane (namely, $(0,\pm 1)$, $(1, \pm 1)$ and $(2, \pm 1)$.) So $\#E(\mathbb{F}_3) = 7$ and $a = -3$. 

Certainly not in general: If $p \equiv 1 \bmod n$ (but $n \neq \pm 1$) then $\mathbb{Q}_p(\zeta_n) = \mathbb{Q}_p$) so $Tr(\zeta_n) = \zeta_n$ which is not in $\mathbb{Q}$. To give another example, take $n=5$ and $p \equiv 4 \bmod 5$. Then $\mathbb{Q}_p$ contains a square root of $5$ and $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1 = (x^2 + (1-\sqrt{5})/2 x +1) (x^2 + (1+\sqrt{5})/2 x +1)$ so the trace of a primitive $5$th root of unity will be $(-1 \pm \sqrt{5})/2$. I am tempted to guess that the only time that this happens is when the $n$-th cyclotomic polynomial is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}_p$, which is equivalent to asking that $(\mathbb{Z}/n \mathbb{Z})^{\ast}$ is cyclic and $p$ is a generator. But I don't see an easy proof of that. Guess is wrong, see below. But it is right when $n$ is square free! 

I don't have a good, explicit description of the missing class. But I want to point out how we could compute anything we want to know about $H^*(MG(3,6))$. The group $SL_3 \times SL_3$ acts on $MG(3,6)$; the first $SL_3$ acting on the first three components of $6$-space and the second $SL_3$ acting on the last $3$ components. Let $T$ be a maximal torus in $SL_3 \times SL_3$; $T$ has dimension $4$. There are $18$ fixed points for the $T$-action on $MG(3,6)$. Namely, they are of the form $e_i \wedge e_j \wedge e_k$ where $1 \leq i < j < k \leq 6$, and $ijk$ is not $123$ or $456$. There are $72$ one-dimensional orbits; they join $e_i \wedge e_j \wedge e_k$ to $e_i \wedge e_j \wedge e_{k'}$. And $MG(3,6)$ is a smooth projective variety. This means that we can compute $H^*(MG(3,6))$ using the "moment graph" method of Goresky, Kottwitz and Macpherson. See Tymoczko's excellent introduction. In particular, what do you actually need? It seems to me that you need to know how $\mathrm{Aut}(MG(3,6))$ acts on $H^4(MG(3,6))$. Your twisted form comes from a class in the group cohomology $H^1(G_F, \mathrm{Aut}(MG(3,6)))$. (Here $G_F$ is the Galois group of $\overline{F}$ over $F$.) You need to know what that class maps to in $H^1(G_F, \mathrm{Aut}(H^4(MG(3,6))))$. Your question about descending cohomology classes should be some simple computation about this cocycle. If your base is a function field over $\mathbb{C}$, then I know how to do this, but your language makes me suspect you are working over a number field, and I don't know quite the right details there. My point is that the moment graph method is explicit enough that we can compute the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(MG(3,6))$ on $H^4(MG(3,6))$, and I think that is all that you need. 

Factor over what field? Over $\mathbb{R}$, this is false. The roots of chromatic polynomials are dense in the complex plane, a result of Sokal. So, let $f(t)$ be a chromatic polynomial which has a root in the left half plane, $f(-a+bi)=0$. Then $t^2+(2a)t+(a^2+b^2)$ is a factor of $f(t)$. 

Here is a simple idea, with no complexity analysis. Compute a basis $v_1$, ..., $v_{n-r}$ for the kernel of $A$; this can be done with exact arithmetic in $n^3$ operations by Gaussian elimination. Compute a basis $w_1$, ..., $w_{r}$ for the othogonal complement: Again, doable in exact arithmetic with $n^3$ operations. $\mathrm{Span}(w_1, ..., w_r)$ is the orthogonal complement to the $0$-eigenspace of $A$ and hence, since $A$ is symmetric, it is the span of the nonzero eigenspaces of $A$. So $A$ maps $\mathrm{Span}(w_1, \ldots, w_r)$ to itself. Let $X$ be the $r \times r$ matrix of this map. This is again a matrix of rational numbers, computable with exact arithmetic in reasonable time, whose eigenvalues are the same as the nonzero eigenvalues of $A$. Note, however, that $X$ is not symmetric. Invert $X$ and find its largest eigenvalue by one of the standard methods. What I am gambling here is that the advantages of working in exact arithmetic are greater than the disadvantages of passing to a nonsymmetric matrix. 

I think the answer is "no". As I suggested in a now-deleted answer, we can restrict ourselves to considering the restriction to a torus invariant $\mathbb{P}^1$. A line bundle on a toric variety is determined by its restriction to each such $\mathbb{P}^1$, and is anti-ample if and only if its restriction to such a $\mathbb{P}^1$ is. Let $P$ be a torus invariant $\mathbb{P}^1$. Let the normal bundle of $P$ be $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-1} \mathcal{O}(a_i)$. So there is a torus invariant open neighborhood of $P$ which has two affine charts: The first one is $\mathrm{Spec} \ k[t, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$ and the second is $\mathrm{Spec} \ k[u, y_1, \ldots, y_{n-1}]$ where, on the overlap, we have $t=u^{-1}$ and $y_i = t^{-a_i} x_i$. (I am using that $X$ is smooth. Otherwise, the normal bundle might not be a vector bundle, and I have to work harder.) Let your line bundle $L$, restricted to $P$, be $\mathcal{O}(-b)$. Since your line bundle is assumed anti-ample, we have $b >0$. Let $q$ and $r$ be generators of your line bundle in the two charts, so $r = t^{-b} q$. (I really hope I'm getting all the signs right. Someone please check!) We now want to consider the Frobenius pushforward, $F_* L$. This has rank $p^n$. In the first chart, a basis is $ t^{c} \prod x_i^{k_i} q$ for $0 \leq c, \ k_i < p$. In the second chart, a basis is $ u^{d} \prod y_i^{\ell_i} r$ with similar bounds. And $$u^{d} \prod y_i^{\ell_i} r = t^{-b} t^{-d} \prod t^{-a_i \ell_i} x_i^{\ell_i} q = (t^p)^{-N} t^c \prod x_i^{\ell_i} q$$ where $c \equiv -b-d - \sum a_i \ell_i \mod p$, with $0 \leq c < p$, and $N = \left( b+c+d + \sum a_i \ell_i \right)/p$. In other words, $N = \lceil (b+d+\sum a_i \ell_i)/p \rceil$ where $\lceil x \rceil$ is the "round up" function. Our bundle is anti-ample if $N > 0$. The first three terms are positive, but there is plenty of room for the last term to be negative. In particular, look at the toric surface whose fan has rays in directions $(1,0)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(-1, -1)$. The four boundary curves have self-intersection, respectively, $(2,0,-2,0)$. Let $L$ be the line bundle whose restrictions to these curves has degree $(-3,-1,-1,-1)$. Let $P$ be the boundary $\mathbb{P}^1$ with self-intersection $-2$, so $a_1=-2$. Then the restriction of $F_* L$ to $P$ has degrees $$\lceil \frac{-1+d - 2 \ell}{p} \rceil$$ where $0 \leq d, \ell < p$. This is $-1$ whenever $2 (\ell/p) - (d/p) > 1$, which happens for about $1/4$ of the possible values of $(c , \ell)$. 

I'll be the obnoxious one: The set of subsets $S$ of $\{ x+iy \in \mathbb{C}, \ 1/2 < x < 1 \}$ such that $\zeta(s)$ restricted to $S$ is zero. 

Even with your updated version, there is not a well defined answer (which does not make this a bad question!) You need to have a prior distribution on the probability that the box contained various numbers of balls to start with. Let's do some small examples. Suppose, that you are given a box with three balls. You sample one ball, and it is white. What should your estimate be that the majority of the balls are white? As we will see, we can't answer this question without some prior beliefs about how the balls were placed in the box. Suppose, at first, that you know the two balls were chosen at random from a large collection, with equally many white and black balls. So, before sampling, your probability estimates were $1/8$ for three black balls, $3/8$ for BBW, $3/8$ for BWW, and $1/8$ for WWW. The probability that the initial distribution was BBW, and that you would sample a white, is $(3/8)(1/3)=1/8$. The corresponding probabilities for BWW and WWW are $1/4$ and $1/8$. So, conditioned on the fact that you sampled a white, the probability that the balls are BBW is $(1/8)/(1/8 + 1/4 + 1/8) = 1/4$, and we see that the probability that the majority are white is $3/4$. But now suppose that white balls are very rare. For example, say your box was packed from a collection which had 9 black balls for every 1 white ball. Then the corresponding probabilities before sampling are $(9/10)^3$ for BBB, $3\*(1/10)\*(9/10)^2$ for BBW, $3\*(1/10)^2\*(9/10)$ for BWW and $(1/10)^3$ for WWW. The probabilities that these distributions would hold and that you would sample a white ball are $(1/10)\*(9/10)^2$ for BBW, $2\*(1/10)^2\*(9/10)$ for BWW and $(1/10)^3$ for WWW. So, conditioned on you sampling a white ball, the probability that the box holds BBW is $$\frac{(1/10)\*(9/10)^2}{(1/10)\*(9/10)^2+ 2\*(1/10)^2\*(9/10)+(1/10)^3},$$ and so forth. I'm too lazy to calculate the probability that the box is majority white in this case, but it should be much less than $3/4$. This is why polls always report their margin of error as a $p$-value. When a pollster says "75% of Americans will vote for Kodos, with a margin of error of $\pm 10%$", this means "the probability that I would have obtained these poll results, conditioned on the assumption that either fewer than 65% or more than 85% of Americans will vote for Kodos, is $<.05$." (The use of $.05$ as a threshold is traditional, and has no deep significance.) If you have prior reason to know that the majority is very likely to vote for Kang then, even after you see the poll, the odds of Kodos winning might still be slim. 

There are two ways to think about this construction. The one I understand well is the one from Cox's original paper. Let $\rho_1$, ..., $\rho_N$ be the rays of $\Sigma$. Let $Y = \mathbb{A}^N$. Each ray represents a class in $H$, and hence a character of $G$. Let $G$ acts on the $i$-th coordinate of $Y$ by the character of $G$ corresponding to $\rho_i$. Let $(y_1, \ldots, y_N)$ be a point of $Y$. Let $i_1$, \ldots, $i_k$ be the coordiantes for which $y_{i_j} =0$. Then $(y_1, \ldots, y_N)$ is in $U$ if and only if there is a cone of $\Sigma$ containing the rays $\rho_{i_1}$, ..., $\rho_{i_k}$. I'll cite you to Cox's paper for the map $U \to X$. 

Haiman's study of the isospectral Hilbert scheme (the reduced fiber product of $\mathbb{C}^{2n}$ and $\mathrm{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ over $\mathrm{Sym}^n \mathbb{C}^2$) features a lengthy combinatorial argument about the combinatorics of hyperplane arrangements and their coordinate rings (Section 4, on polygraphs). 

I suspect there are fields $K$ with $K \supset \mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $Gal(K/\mathbb{Q}) \cong GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4)$ where the map $$GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4) \cong Gal(K/\mathbb{Q}) \twoheadrightarrow Gal(\mathbb{Q}(i)/\mathbb{Q}) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/4)^{\times}$$ is not cyclotomic, and can't be made so by any automorphism of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4)$. Namely, there is a map $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4) \to \{ \pm 1 \}$ defined as the composition $$GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4) \to GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2) \cong S_3 \to \{ \pm 1 \}$$ where the last map is the sign character. This map sends $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ to $-1$, while determinant sends it to $1$. The conjugacy class of $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ can be intrinsically described as the only conjugacy class which squares to the non-identity central element in $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4)$. So no automorphism of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4)$ can equate these characters. I see no reason that this map $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/4) \to \{ \pm 1 \}$ couldn't correspond to an inclusion $\mathbb{Q}(i) \subset K$.
