I got this from the House of Representatives site noted below, and they give a little more on the tradition and how this was originally done by Junior Members, some who were the first's such as the first female Representatives from a state, first Asian-American woman who was the Representative from Hawaii. House History on the Farewell Address 

I could not find an overview of countries directly, but if you check the Gender Equality Index and look at the links they have by country you will get an overview. They seem up to date, even noting the decline of multiple wives in Saudi Arabia, the Country Overview will get you to the topmost listing. Additional Sources: 

Although it looks like this had been problematic for a long time, since apparently participation in this was falling off over the previous few decades. 

The US does provide money abroad for humanitarian reasons, although I am sure some money can go through certain channels (or agencies) and find it's way to foreign political parties that are pro-US. This is certainly the case with governments which receive funds from the US in order to keep the party in power, or certainly influence a pro-US point of view. It happens, has happened and in many ways is legal as it's money spent under Foreign Aid, although it is becoming a political topic now that the US is heading into elections and our budget can't readily support such subsidies. If there are political parties being given money I don't know, but it probably happens and in many cases is probably done so it's untracable. Political parties in power in the US do give money to support parts of their agenda, the most recent example I can think of is the Bush Administration stopped giving aid money to organizations that promoted abortion. There are controversies, but many either blow over when a scandal comes up, or a new Administration comes to power and then reverts any foreign aid assistance guidelines imposed by the previous administration. 

If anything, their choice in names indicates they were good New England protestants. When you see hoofprints, think horses, not zebras. Likewise, Bampett Muhamed and Yusuf ben Ali (formerly Joseph Benhaley) are also freed slaves, and while they undoubtedly indicate an Islamic heritage, without firm evidence it's unknown if they were practicing Muslims or simply Christians or agnostics who took back their family names upon emancipation. The historical record of Islam in Colonial America indicates only captured slaves were (sometimes) permitted to practice Islam, and they were usually subject to attempts at conversion by the slaveholders, as was the case with the famed author, scholar and theologian Omar Ibn Said. So, while it's plausible, there isn't enough of a record to say for certain. 

This argument only makes sense if the war in Vietnam drew away money, manpower and attention from the other regional Communist fights - in other words, did volunteer brigades from Singapore and Malaysia and the Phillipines take up the fight for North Vietnam? Did communists in those countries lend significant aid to the NVA or Viet Cong that stalled their own ambitions domestically? No, they did not. The Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge did, and their nations wound up under communist regimes. So the opposite of the author's assertion appears to be true. The United States radicalized and legitimatized communist rebels in neighboring nations through inept and callously brutal strategy, allowing them to gain and consolidate power. As to the notion that the resources of Vietnam's larger allies - the Soviet Union and its European allies and China - were enmired in the conflict, this is dismissed by noting the successful anti-colonial revolutions in Africa occurring at the same time (Mozambique, Guinea-Bisseau, Congo, Angola, etc.) that were backed by money, men and material from the communist powers. 

I was looking back at my grandmother's voyage to America, she made the trip from Zbaraz in the Ukraine through Warsaw and then on to Gdanks and through steerage class to the New York. I know she took a specific route through Poland and to Gdansk but not how, that was something we never documented. It made me wonder how emigres from the region might have travelled across Eastern Europe and to ports like Gdansk in the early 20th Century (for my grandmother this was about 1917), were train lines available as transportation and affordable to emigres? Would they have walked? Horse and buggy/cart/wagon or some other means? I'm only concerned for Eastern Europe at this point, but if anyone has ideas for how travel might have gone in the region I'd be curious to know. My own knowledge of the region and time makes me think most would have travelled north or maybe east, going south the Ottoman Empire or the Black Sea doesn't seem like the best method to emigrate to the US. Northern sea ports on the North Sea seemed to have the routes to New York and the US more settled than others, but I am not sure if there were ports east of Italy that might have been used (although there probably are and I am unaware of them.) edit: Originally I erred and noted Warsaw as the port when it should have been Gdansk, sorry about that! 

Ugarkina of Lagash, circa the 24th century BCE, is generally credited* as the first effective reformer in recorded history to grant broad legal rights to commoners, the poor and disabled, and elevate many more women into the ranks of the political elite while reigning in secular corruption and abuse of power by wealthy landowners and the priestly class. These reforms and rights are documented on the Liberty Cones of Lagash. The economic reforms are based on those of his predecessor Enmetena, but Ugarkina goes further in guaranteeing the rights of his subjects, and there is evidence of both their positive outcomes, and disastrous consequences (the reactionary military class stood by while the city was conquered.) (*Criticisms of this claim are typically from the extreme left and right wings of the political spectrum and not supported by available evidence, or worse, confused with Enmetena or other rulers not associated with Lagash.) 

They may be thinking of Zhu Yujian, the last prince of the Ming Dynasty who escaped the Qing with the help of Zhen Zhilong, who had the christian name of Nicholas Iquan Gaspard. 

Jared Diamond, a cross-discipline scholar who's work more or less accurately reflects modern thinking in History, Sociology and human evolution and biology, makes a detailed review of their work here. He's pretty enthusiastic about it overall, but he does note some problems. Here's the summary: 

The Soviets only had a small presence in Yugoslavia, during the capture of Belgrade where they only had an assisting role - Tito's Partisans proved more than capable of defeating the Nazis on their own. The troops in Yugoslavia, the 2nd and 3rd Ukranian Front, were needed elsewhere, and so were redeployed to Hungary once it was clear the Yugoslavians had things well in hand. The Wiki article on the Tito-Stalin split has some more background on how Yugoslavia avoided becoming a satellite state of the Soviet Union. 

While the legal conventions are there, and some laws limit it to 4 wives, it is the religious convention from the Qur'an (the spelling I will use) where it is strictly spelled out how you can have multiple wives. In The Qur'an and multiple Wives 

William Howard Taft is the first one that comes to mind, since he served as the 27th President of the United States from 1909 to 1913, he didn't really like it and later became a professor of law at Yale and then was nominated for the Supreme Court as Chief Justice. You can read a little bio on him at the White House web site. 

What you may be confusing in this case is what is termed the War Powers Act which gives the President latitude to actually engage in military operations for up to 90 days before declaring war or going to Congress. Part of this stems from the face that Vietnam avoided this with the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which then President Lyndon Johnson used to initially get Congress to accede into allowing soldiers to be sent to Vietnam. Later there were disputes about the accuracy of the attacks cited to get the resolution passed, note the end of the article which mentions the major points. While the War Powers Act has been side-stepped since its passing, the discussions on this came up most recently after the September 11th attacks, a good read on this at Slate which goes over the War Powers act and some of the discussions around sending troops into combat. So to reiterate my comment, its not like it used to be but times and the methods of war have changed since the Constitution and the Presidents powers have been written. 

The Green Gang were among Chaing Kai-shek's largest financial backers - they saw the communists as bad for business, and the Nationalist forces welcomed the money and street-level intel the triad could provide. Kai-skek needed the Green Gang to retain his hold on the KMT over challenges from Jingwei, and bring the left wing of the party to heel. 

The process of wrapping purchases in paper and twine is called packaging, and the resultant wrapped item is called a package. (You will hear purchases sometimes referred to as packages in old books, TV shows and movies.) It was replaced by self-service shops and sturdy paper bags beginning in the '30s. To begin with, paper was used as flexible packaging as early as the 2nd century BCE in China, and was introduced to America in 1690. The shopping bag was invented in St. Paul, MN by grocer Walter H. Deubner in 1912: 

He pushed for a private and independent central bank, the First Bank of the United States. It was similar to the Bank of England, except he expected it to loan money to private institutions and businesses as well as perform its government duties. He also founded the Bank of New York, which was a private lending institution similar to modern commercial banks. 

The earliest written reference to a war was between Sumer and Elam in 2700BCE. The earliest battle we have a written account for is Megiddo... Thutmose III vs. The Caananites, lead by the city of Kadesh. The Egyptians won, and tossed up a bunch of monuments to celebrate the victory, wrote a bunch of scrolls on the topic, and so knowledge of the battle was passed down to the present. The earliest archaeological record of warfare was also in Egypt, but between those who lived on the lower nile and those who lived on the upper nile in Sudan. 

About the only book I have come across in looking at the Mayan Calendar, which only came from a class exercise in looking for more information on the Mayan Apocalypse, was the E.G. Richards book Mapping Time. It noted some ideas of lucky and unlucky days, as well as more on other calendar systems. Honestly I don't recall how much he covered in all of it, and some of the book comes across as more of his way of showing how much he knows about calendars. Still its one I hope to use to teach my kids about calendars at some point. Although there is more about the Mayan Calendars regarding the Calendar Wheels a good overview from Harvard on the system but as to auspicious days much of what I have seen is more about the person than just general lucky days. In many ways its sort of like other star based systems where the conjunction of the stars and planets align and are then observed against a persons birth. From what I read before much of the practice and determination of "auspicious days" centered around Venus and its location in the Heavens, maybe its more noticable from their location or not. So if you could find a chart that noted the path of Venus across the Mayan calendar you should get your days. I haven't seen one. You can look at Richards book on Amazon if you want a little more on it. Also, I found another online source on the Mayan Religious practices you can check out.
