together with the rules of modus ponens A,A→B⊢B and adjunction A,B⊢A∧B. I read that axioms (2), (3) and (4) can be substituted by 2'. (A→B)→((B→C)→(A→C)) 3'. (A→(B→C))→((A→B)→(A→C)) 4'. A→((A→B)→B) and axioms (1) and (4) also by 1''. ((A→A)→B)→B 4''. A→((A→A)→A) (from which I see that the equivalence between A and (A→A)→A follows, as the authors say). I am inclined to think that can be substituted means that the systems obtained by substituting the respective axioms are equivalent*, but I have not been able to prove the equivalence of the systems obtained by substituting the respective axioms. How can it be proved? I heartily thank you for any answer! 

In Stalnaker semantics a conditional A↦B is true in world u if either A is not logically possible (ex absurdo quodlibet holds in the semantics) or A is logically possible and B is true in the nearest world where A is true. A↦B axiomatically implies the classical logic implication A→B. I read -in D. Palladino, C. Palladino, Logiche non classiche 'non-classical logics'- that various conditions are assumed in Stalnaker semantics, among them: 

*By equivalence of the systems I mean: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)⊢(1)∧(2')∧(3')∧(4')∧(5)∧(6)∧(7)∧(8)∧(9)∧(10) and (1),(2'),(3'),(4'),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)⊢(1)∧(2)∧(3)∧(4)∧(5)∧(6)∧(7)∧(8)∧(9)∧(10) and (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)⊢(1'')∧(2')∧(3')∧(4'')∧(5)∧(6)∧(7)∧(8)∧(9)∧(10) and (1''),(2'),(3'),(4''),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)⊢(1)∧(2)∧(3)∧(4)∧(5)∧(6)∧(7)∧(8)∧(9)∧(10) where I have used the number of the axioms as propositional symbols and where ⊢ represents deduction by using the two rules. 

Then I read that the enrichment law which is stated, in classical logic, as (A→B)→(A∧C→B) does not hold in Stalnaker's system. I think that it means that (A↦B)→(A∧C↦B) does not hold. The reason why the enrichment law does not hold is, as the book says, that the nearest world where A is true is not necessarily the nearest world where A∧C is true. I think that what is shown here is that A∧C↦B can be false while A↦B is true, which would falsify (A↦B)→(A∧C↦B) and, since we assume axiom (A↦B)→(A→B), would also falsify (A↦B)↦(A∧C↦B). But how can we say that there can be a world w which is the nearest world where A∧C is true, but B is false in w, if condition (3) says that the nearest A∧C-world is also the nearest A-world, where we assume that B is true? I have taken into account that the only possible case that I can see where the nearest A-world and A∧C-world are not the same is given when no A∧C-world exists, but then A∧C↦B would be true by Scotus' quodlibet law, if I am not wrong... Thank you very much for any clarification! 

Is this really so? Imagine the whole English-speaking world and the people behind making leading English dictionaries gather up and collectively decide that from now on, the words 'tail' and 'leg' are synonyms. Would then the answer to the question 'how many legs does a dog have' be 'five'? What does modern philosophy of language have to say about this? 

Does that imply that the English-speaking world believes in hard determinism, at least unconsciously? Does language in this case reflect the speakers' beliefs? 

When an atheist says she's spiritual, she means that she finds beauty and balance in the world around her and in her very own self. There are lots of activities other than the ones that have to do with religion that you can participate in that will get you that outlook on life: art, science, philosophy, etc. 

Are (or were) there any philosophers that argue (or argued) that the human brain cannot be understood using a human brain, i.e. that it's impossible for a human to understand the human brain completely? 

Does the difficulty of making sense of quantum mechanical phenomena, (i.e. arriving at a nice philosophical interpretation of QM) taken together with Everett's many-worlds interpretation, constitute real evidence for accepting modal realism? I understand that Everett's worlds are just nomologically possible worlds, not possible worlds in general. Has this already been discussed somewhere philosophically? 

Are there any examples of philosophers who did (or do) neither analytic nor continental philosophy, but rather practiced (or practice) a harmonious mix between the two? 

Lately there have been a lot of hot debates on how much mathematics should be taught in high schools and in which way (especially in the West). In this way, mathematics plays a role of a subject that gets people thinking about how the education system in a given country should be laid out, which in turn is very tangential to politics. There are a lot of amazing papers on the subject, see the results of this Google search. 

The main argument as I see it: Whether or not people are empathetic, our actions are still determined by physical reality: i.e. struggle for resources. And whether or not we feel empathy will not change the fact that we need to commit what you'd call 'bad' actions to get what we want. Genetically, and scientifically, nearly everyone has the capacity for empathy, but they also have the capacity for evil. So then morality doesn't arise when you are even more empathetic, morality arises when the physical environment effectively regulates your behavior. 

Mostly, I'm curious about the lasting impacts of classical philosophy, but in the name of brevity and specifics I'll confine my question to the influence classical Greek philosophy had on the next major Western civilization: Ancient Rome. What I wonder is, in what ways did Ancient Greek philosophy influence Ancient Rome, in terms of things like political philosophy, science, art, and religion? 

Some searching for studies on Google Scholar will turn up any number of articles which suggest humans have evolved as a social species with cognitive faculties which make them better adapted to interact with other humans, and thrive in environments with positive social interaction. For instance, Herrmann, 2007 

A person needs to have knowledge about the problem, and A person needs to be aware of mental concepts to manipulate that knowledge to reach the conclusion. 

People can ultimately only be judged by the things they actually do, not the things they think. It's completely possible for a person to believe themselves to be good and think good thoughts, but in practice carry out selfish acts regularly. It's also possible for someone to think evil thoughts regularly, but to have a moral conscience which filters them out and promotes only good action. At the end of the day our relationship with other human beings and living things can only be subjectively judged by how we treat them in practice, not in theory So with that said I would argue that the only way you can label someone as 'good' or 'evil' is based on what they actually do, and nothing else. This means that 'good people that do bad things' and 'evil people that do good things' don't exist, rather there are only 'evil people who do evil things' and 'good people who do good things'. The reality of it, however, is not that cut and dry as everyone has capacity for good and evil, but my main point is that you can only judge a person by the output, and nothing else. 

It seems like in (ii) we posit consciousness, this complex unexplainable "thing", on billions of people. So, the natural questions are: Does Occam's razor actually favor (i) over (ii)? If so, then why is (ii) so widespread, even among philosophers? 

Does this apply to humans? I'm not referring to any hypothetical intelligent designer. What I mean is that out of all animals, only humans (at least normal ones) seem to conceive children with an intention (e.g. with an intention of having another loved one, etc.) and not just because they desperately want to reproduce. 

Did Aristotle mean by 'Mean' exactly the middle between two extremes, or just some "sweet spot" that need not be the middle at all? 

It's not necessarily a contradiction. (By the way, the question the way you have put it has to do with logic and the philosophy of language and has nothing to do with psychology.) Before we begin, let's take a look at what definitons of the words "trust" and "anxiety" Merriam-Webster gives: 

English speakers put the definite article "the" before the word "future" when they refer to the future (no pun intended). For example: 

What exactly did Hardy mean by "ugly mathematics"? For example, would Hardy find the number π ugly if he found out about the tau manifesto? 

In the movie Time Machine (2002) there is a scene in which the protagonist and his girlfriend are walking in the park and the robber they meet wants to take her ring (bought for her by the protagonist). The protagonist refuses to give the ring to him which results in the robber shooting the girlfriend and killing her. After that, there is a scene where the protagonist is talking with his friend about this: 

First, as a human being you set a pre-defined goal in your life, maybe you want kids, maybe you want riches, maybe you want to travel, maybe you want to be moral. Whatever it is, this is the end goal of your behaviour. In a universal sense you have no obligation to do any particular thing, insofar as you're willing to accept the consequence of either action or inaction. I would say that if action or inaction enhances or impedes your ability to fulfil your long-term goal, that should dictate whether or not you do it, not some ephemeral sense of obligation to a situation. 

So from that it follows that the more knowledge one has about the problem and the more mental concepts one has to manipulate that knowledge the more effective their thinking will be. The original question seems to focus on the second point: which concepts can we use to improve our ability to think, whereas I'm taking an even higher look at the problem and stating that the more we know about something the easier it will be for us to solve problems in that domain. To use a concrete example, if someone enters the programming field and tries to start a junior position with no experience, they'll have no ability to solve problems within that field due to lack of knowledge and mental concepts. As they continue to learn knowledge of varying programming languages and mental concepts with which to use those programming languages, the quality of their ability to solve problems begins to improve. So at the highest level what this means is that if one wants a better ability think critically about something they need to spend more and more time learning about that thing, and how others have approached that thing with different constructs. Within that, if one wants to start looking into different mental constructs to improve their problem solving process, they can do so, but my answer actually encompasses that process. What I'm suggesting is that to think more critically one needs to actively pursue more mental concepts and knowledge.
