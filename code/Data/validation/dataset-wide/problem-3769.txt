Let $M_i$ be fixed rectangular matrices with integer coefficients less than $n$. Consider the variety defined by the condition $$ \mathrm{rank}(\lambda_1M_1 + \lambda_2M_2 + ... + \lambda_kM_k) = 1. $$ Assume that there is an integral point $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k)$ lying on this variety, can we then guarantee that there is an integral point with the height (maximal absolute value of the coordinates) bounded polynomially in $n$ (the exponent may depend on $k$ and the size of the matrices)? P. S. It might be related to the Birch-Davenport theorem, so with high probability this question is either known or out of reach for current methods (which would be ok to know), but I couldn't find a reference. 

Here's an idea I had for trying to prove a theorem of the sort I ask for in Question 1. Recall the definition of the local ring of a zero $p\in M$ of a section of E: Write $\mathcal{O}_p$ for the ring of germs of smooth functions about $p$. Definition. Let $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$ be a smooth section which vanishes at $p$. The local ring of the germ $[\sigma]_p$, denoted $Q([\sigma]_p)$, is the quotient $\mathcal{O}_p/([\sigma]_p)$, where $([\sigma]_p)$ is the ideal of $\mathcal{O}_p$ generated by "components of $\sigma$": $([\sigma]_p)=\ <\{[v(\sigma)]_p:v\text{ a nonvanishing section of }E^*\}> \ \subseteq \mathcal{O}_p$. Theorem 2 (Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili). Suppose $p$ is a zero of $\sigma$, and the local ring $Q([\sigma]_p)$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over $\mathbb{R}$. Then there is a canonical quadratic form on $Q([\sigma]_p)$, such that the degree of the zero of $\sigma$ at $p$ can be calculated as this quadratic form's signature. Because a system of PDE is precisely a constraint on the local behaviour of a section, it seems plausible that local rings of zeros of solutions of a PDE might have interesting properties. 

There is a paper by Gy\H{o}ry and Lemons "Hypergraphs with No Cycle of a Given Length", which bounds number of hyperedges for hypergraphs avoiding cycles of length $2k$ (unfortunately, I have access only to the abstract: $URL$ Particularly, in the case of a uniform 4-hypergraph avoiding 2-cycles it seems to provide $O(n^2)$ bound. I am wondering if it is possible to improve this to $o(n^2)$ or it is sharp? Here 2-cycle simply means two hyperedges $E_1, E_2$ which intersect in $2$ vertices. 

A nice Lemma due to Konyagin asserts that for any subset $B \subset \mathbb{F}_p$ holds $$ |B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B| \geq \frac{1}{2}\min\{p, |B|^2 \}, $$ where the standard notation for the product set $B.B$ is used. Now suppose that instead of $B.B$ we have a partial productset $B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ along the edges of a graph $G$ of edge density $\epsilon$ (meaning that $b_1b_2 \in B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ if only if $b_1, b_2 \in B$ are adjacent in $G$). Is it true that if $B < \sqrt{p}$ a similar estimate $$ |B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B| \gg_{\epsilon} |B|^2 $$ holds? UPD Sorry for sloppy notation. So what it means. $B.B = \{b_ib_j |b_i, b_j \in B \}$, $B.B-B.B = \{b_ib_j - b_kb_l |b_i, b_j, b_k, b_k \in B\}$, and $B.B+B.B$ etc. being defined the same way. 

Let me give what I think is an infinite set of such systems, and you can tell me whether it's what you had in mind: $e^w + p(e^w)e^{-(k+1)w}$, where $p(w)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $k$. The first three examples you listed correspond, up to constants, to $p(w) = 0$, $p(w) = 1$, and $p(w) = -1$, respectively. For $u=Re(w)$ large, $|e^w|$ is large, so $|p(e^w)e^{-(k+1)w}|\leq C|e^{-w}|$ is small. Therefore $e^w + p(e^w)e^{-(k+1)w}$ is quite close to the spherical-coordinates transformation $e^w$, so the asymptotic behaviour is circles-and-lines. 

A complete connected Riemannian manifold is a complete length space. A Gromov-Hausdorff limit of complete length spaces is a complete length space. 

If you divide on $a$ and let $a$ to be big you have basically a set of linear inequalities of the form $1-o(1) \geq b_ic-d_i \geq o(1)$. If you look at $b_ic$ geometrically, it is a beam of lines emanating from zero with slopes $b_1, ..., b_{a-1}$. And you want to find a point $c$ such that the line $x = c$ intersects each line in a strip $1+d_i-o(1) \geq y \geq d_i+o(1)$. It seems that if you order the lines according to the slope and starting from the line with the smallest slope (smallest $b_i$) it is possible to choose $d_i$ for each new line appropriately (based on the geometric representation above) 

Geometric motivation: By Clairaut's relation, if for some $T$, $$\int_c^{T}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2},$$ then there are two three distinct geodesics between the points $(T,0, \tfrac{1}{2}T^2)$ and $(-T,0, \tfrac{1}{2}T^2)$ on the paraboloid of revolution $z=\tfrac{1}{2}r^2$: one through the point $(0,0,0)$, $(0, c, \tfrac{1}{2}c^2)$ and one through the point $(0, -c, \tfrac{1}{2}c^2)$. Edit: Deleted the comment about injectivity radius which concluded my original question -- it was false. Note that the answers of Nemo and Christian Remling, below, appear to work for any integration bound $T$, not just for $T=\pi/2$: for any $T>0$, $$\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{T}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2}.$$ 

Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold, with $\text{rank}(E)=\text{dim}(M)$. For a section $\sigma$ of $E$ with a zero at $p\in M$, define the degree of the zero at $p$ to be the topological degree of the induced map from a small sphere in $T_pM$ to a small sphere in $E_p$. One motivation for studying degrees of zeros is that they contain information about the topology of $E$. I think the following is true, although I couldn't find a good reference: Theorem 1 (Hopf index theorem). Suppose the zeroes of $\sigma$ are the isolated points $p_1, \ldots p_k$, with degrees $d_1,\ldots d_k$ respectively. Then the Euler class of $E$ is $\chi(E)=\sum_{i=1}^kd_i$. With this as motivation, my first question, the one stated in the title, is roughly (see the Example for an idea of what I'm getting at, and feel free to suggest a sharper version): 

Let $a_1, ..., a_d$ be positive reals and consider the linear Diophantine equation $$ \sum_i a_in_i = 0. $$ I am interested in estimating the number of integer solutions of this equation inside a box $[-N_1, N_1] \times ... \times [-N_d, N_d]$ and also the minimal basis for the corresponding integer lattice in terms of $a_1,...,a_d$. More specifically, it seems that if the number of solutions is of order $N^{d-1}$ then $(a_1, ...., a_d)$ should be proportional to some integer vector of bounded norm. Presumably, smth much more precise is known. I believe that such kind of questions are well studied so any good reading on this topic would be highly appreciated. 

The pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit is a line. Pulling back by the diffeomorphisms $(x,y)\mapsto (nx, 1/n y)$, we get a sequence of metrics $n^2dx^2+1/n^2dy^2$ all on the "same" torus $\mathbb{R}^2/\Lambda_1$, satisfying the above and also your extra assumption of having the same area element. These metric tensors have no ($\mathcal{W}^{k,p}$, say) limit. 

Then $(X,d,p)$ is (topologically) a smooth orbifold, whose singularities are of the form $\mathbb{R}^n/\Gamma$ for some finite $\Gamma\subseteq SO(n)$. I'm trying to get a sense of how sharp this statement is. Here's a possible converse. Question. Suppose I have a spherical space form $S^{n-1}/\Gamma$, and a $n$-manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M = S^{n-1}/\Gamma$. Can I construct a sequence of complete Riemannian metrics on $M$'s interior, all satisfying the bounds above, such that some pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n/\Gamma$? A few remarks on what I know: I am aware of some standard constructions for particular $\Gamma$, such as the ALE hyperk√§hler metrics for $\Gamma\subseteq SU(2)$. However, I don't know any good general ways to construct a family of metrics satisfying two-sided Ricci bounds. 

It is well known that for a given polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ the number of primes $p$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$ is infinite. In fact, one can even write down a formula for the density of such primes (e.g. D. Berend, Y. Bilu "Polynomials with roots modulo every integer"). Now suppose that $f = \sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i$ is irreducible, the degree $d$ is fixed and all $a_i \leq N^C$ for some constant $C$. Is it possible to prove the uniform bound (e.g. whith the constant depending only on $d$ and $C$ and $N$ large) $$ \pi(N, f) = \Omega_{d, C}(\frac{N}{\log N}), $$ where $\pi(N, f)$ means the number of primes less than $N$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$? The aforementioned paper cites a general density formula due to Lagarias and Odlyzko which seem to provide such a bound assuming GRH. It's of course highly desirable to drop this assumption.
