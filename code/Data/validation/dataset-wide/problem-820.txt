For a test object located anywhere else, the net gravitational acceleration vector does not point toward the barycenter. 

Even in a project that is solely people-based, most of the costs do not end up as salaries to engineers. Salary is typically a bit less than a half of the cost. Those engineers get benefits. Health care in the US isn't cheap. They get holidays, vacation, and sick leave. They receive matching funds on their 401K contributions. In the US, employers and employees both contribute to the cesspool lockbox sometimes known as "Social Security". The employer share is part of the cost of having an employee (and companies charge for it). The employer also pays for unemployment insurance and other items on behalf of their employees. Those engineers sit at desks in an office or a cubicle, and have a nice computer on which they do their work. They use the employer's servers, printers, copy machines, conference rooms, break rooms, and coffee machines. All of that costs money. These overhead costs are the first of several indirect costs. The accountants who write those engineers their paychecks aren't charging to any project. They're still paid by the company, as are the executives of the company. The executives also typically don't charge their time to a project, and those executives can be paid quite handsomely. This leads to another category that adds to quantity that companies charge the government, "general and accounting". Finally, for-profit companies need to keep their shareholders / stakeholders happy. They need to earn a profit. This leads to a third category that companies charge the government, "profit". When you add up all of those indirect costs, they come close to and oftentimes exceed direct costs (i.e., chargeable salary). Note that this is for a project where the only costs are the people working on it. Building a spacecraft notches things up a lot. Cleanrooms are expensive. Control rooms are expensive. The flight computers are expensive. The bolts and fasteners are expensive. The custom, one-off sensors are expensive. The spacecraft's thermal control system is expensive. The spacecraft's structure is expensive. Launch is expensive. Every piece of hardware, every fabrication facility is expensive. 

This was a coronal mass ejection. Those 1973 astronomers weren't looking at the picture correctly. They didn't have the tools at that time to look at the picture correctly. Coronal mass ejections (the term used now) were only discovered a couple of years prior to that picture taken from Skylab, via the Orbiting Solar Observatory 7 satellite. Those early 1970s astronomers called such events "coronal transients". OSO-7 took 45 minutes to transmit a single 256x256 image back to Earth. A proper look at the picture took a few more years to develop. Those coronal mass ejections (the term used now) eject massive amounts of solar material into space. When looked at via a single still image, it does indeed appear that material is looping up only to fall back to the Sun. 

We see sunspots, which are giant, planet-sized storms on the surface of the Sun. There are however many differences between sunspots, the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, and tropical cyclones (e.g., hurricanes) on the Earth. Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems fueled by evaporation of warm ocean water and sustained by the Earth's somewhat rapid rotation rate. The Great Red Spot is a high pressure system that is sustained by Jupiter's quite rapid rotation rate. Sunspots are low temperature systems fueled by the Sun's magnetic field and carried along by the Sun's rather low rotation rate. 

That is not a good mental model. The only contact between your car and the ground are the bottoms of the four wheels on your car. The forces at these four small contact areas are what change your car's orientation and change your car's velocity vector. This means that the torque on your car as you turn the steering wheel and the centripetal force on your car that makes your care negotiate a turn are intimately connected. Turn the steering wheel gently and the heavy front end of your car follows suit. Assuming a gentle turn, the light rear end of you car soon follows suit. If you turn too hard, your car starts to skid instead of turn. Turn even harder yet and you risk having your car flip and roll. The motion of your car depends on that intimate coupling between force and torque. Gravitation doesn't work like that. It instead acts on each and every bit of the Earth, all together, all at once, all the time. There is a slight variation in the gravitationally-induced acceleration across the Earth due to variations in distance to the Moon (or Sun), but these variations are small. The net gravitational force on the Earth is very much decoupled from the small net gravity gradient torque on the Earth. The principal result of the gravity gradient torque exerted by the Moon and the Sun on the Earth is a very slow but large precession of the Earth's rotation axis (for more, read this wikipedia article on axial precession). This precession makes the Earth's rotation axis rotate about the normal to the ecliptic at a rate of one revolution per 25772 years. There are lesser effects collectively called nutations and polar motion that result from gravity gradient torque. These lesser effects are much, much smaller in magnitude but have much, much shorter periods. The largest of these lesser effects results from the 18.61 year cyclical variations in the lunar node. Even this largest component of nutation is small, two orders of magnitude smaller than the large but slow precession. 

The switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar involved two changes. One change was the frequency at which leap years occur. The Julian calendar had a leap year every four years, making a Julian year 365.25 days long on average. The Gregorian calendar has 97 leap years every 400 years, making a Gregorian year 365.2425 days long on average. The other change was a one-time shortening of some year to bring the calendar back in line with the seasons in the third century AD. Different countries did this differently, some as early as 1582, others as late as 1923. As depicted above, Great Britain made this change in 1752 by making 3 September 1752 to 13 September 1752 vanish (that's eleven days). Since that change, both 1800 and 1900 would have been leap years in the Julian calendar but were not in the Gregorian calendar. Eleven days lost in September 1752 plus two more days for no February 29th in 1800 or 1900 exactly accounts for your thirteen day discrepancy. 

Not really. At least not in the sense of a star sliding along the main sequence. That doesn't happen. Instead, a star remains more or less parked at one spot on the main sequence during it's lifetime as a main sequence star. A protostar is more luminous and cooler than the zero age main sequence star it will become. Once a star "ignites" (starts fusing hydrogen (not deuterium)) is when a star enters the main sequence. This is where the star spends the majority of its life. In the case of small stars, stars whose mass is less than about 40% of the Sun's mass, this is where the star will spend the entirety of its life as a star. Small stars get dimmer and dimmer as they age. Larger stars don't thoroughly mix from the innermost core to the outermost regions. These larger stars build up an ash of helium as they age. This hydrogen fusion eventually comes to an end when all of the hydrogen in the core has been fused into helium. That's when the star departs the main sequence. Unlike small stars, larger stars get brighter (more luminous) as they age. Larger stars (stars larger than 40% solar masses) might double or triple in luminosity as they age. That's a third to a half order of magnitude increase, and that's tiny compared to the eleven or twelve orders of magnitude difference in luminosity shown on an HR diagram between the smallest red dwarf and the largest blue giant. What this means is that once a non-tiny star enters the main sequence, it more or less stays at that spot on the main sequence until it leaves the main sequence. 

You are off by quite a bit. There is essentially no horizontal deflection when the Moon is at the horizon. The maximum horizontal deflection occurs when the Moon is about 45 degrees above or below the horizon. The tidal acceleration at some point on the surface of the Earth due to some external body (e.g., the Moon) is the difference between the gravitational acceleration toward that external body at the point in question and the gravitational acceleration of the Earth as a whole toward that body: $$\vec a_{rel} = GM_\text{body} \left(\frac {\vec R - \vec r} {||\vec R - \vec r||^3} - \frac {\vec R} {||\vec R||^3} \right)$$ where 

The key difference between the two (VSOP87 from PlanEph versus DE431 from the JPL HORIZONS web site) is the time reference. PlanEph uses UT (Universal Time) while JPL uses TDB (Barycentric Dynamic Time; the acronym is from the French equivalent). On 1 Jan 2000, TDB was ahead of UT by 64.183927 seconds. This means that 12:01:04.183927 TDB on 1 Jan 2000 is the same as 12:00 UT on 1 Jan 2000. The values from JPL HORIZONS at this time are an X,Y,Z position of $X = -19459352\ \text{km}$, $Y=-66913992\ \text{km}$, $Z = -3680131\ \text{km}$ - a mere 30.5 kilometer root sum square difference compared to the VSOP87 vector. 

So what is the right way of looking at orbits amongst a hierarchy of masses? One issue that needs to be addressed is what the word "orbit" means. Note that people do write and talk about parabolic and hyperbolic "orbits". I'm assuming that "orbit" in the context of this question means a bounded trajectory, which would rule out calling a hyperbolic or parabolic trajectory an "orbit". That leads to the first of three characteristics of whether object A can be said to be orbiting object B: Object A can be said to be orbiting object B only if object A is gravitationally bound to object B. The appropriate metric here is energy, at least for cosmologically small distances. (Note: The distance between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy is very small in a cosmological sense.) From the perspective of a frame centered at object B, the total mechanical energy of object A needs to be negative he mechanical energy to be able to say that object A is (at least temporarily) orbiting object B. Bounded orbits remain bounded forever in the two body point mass problem. That may not be the case when other larger objects are involved. This leads to a second criterion: Object A can be said to be orbiting object B only if the gravitational influences of larger objects on object A are but small perturbative effects that don't result in instabilities. The appropriate metric here is an energy-based sphere of influence. The two most widely used spheres are the Hill sphere and the Laplace sphere. For example, because the Moon is gravitationally bound to the Earth and because the Moon is well inside the Earth's Hill and Laplace spheres with respect to the Sun, it is appropriate to say that the Moon does indeed orbit the Earth. What about the Sun and the Milky Way (and even larger objects such as the Local Group)? Can the Moon also be said to orbit those? The answer is yes. One way to look at it is to ask what would happen if the Earth suddenly disappeared. Would the Moon's path around the Sun change much? The answer is no. The Moon would still be orbiting the Sun at about one astronomical unit. The same applies to the Earth with respect to the Milky Way. The Earth's trajectory about the galaxy would not change by much at all if the rest of the solar system magically disappeared. This point of view however leads to some troubling issues. Planets (and stars and galaxies) don't magically disappear. Moreover, if Saturn somehow did magically disappear, its rings and all but its very outermost moons would be on hyperbolic trajectories with respect to the Sun. A way around this magic is to say that if object A orbits object B, and object B orbits object C, then object A also orbits object C. "Orbit" is not a mutually exclusive concept.
