Another real-world example Yes, a geological process can be known to happen in one location only. Look up natural nuclear reactors - in a very very few places, uranium has formed a natural reactor. To be exact, only one is known, in an African site. A natural reactor needed 5 things: 

Does "interacting with civilisation" include (a) interacting with individuals in it, or (b) affecting individuals without "interacting" with them? Level 3 implies some extremely high level technical abilities, including changes specific to the immediate environment around each person. Perhaps distortion of electromagnetism - light we see, electrical impulses from our senses or in our neurology. Changes to the immediate environment of each person - changing the partial gas pressures to prevent respiration would be a neat one. So would transforming all food at the point of eating to remove key nutrients as they are ingested. Doing this for a few billion people over a few years (if not all at the same time) wouldn't be much of a challenge. I'm reminded of a SciFi comment whose source I cannot remember, that to prevent the rise of Hitler, all that would have been needed would to create sound waves of voices next to his ears, day and night, preventing concentration and disrupting purposeful behaviour, and consigning him fairly quickly to an asylum, suicide, or to behaviour that gets him ignored rather than followed. There are probably thousands of ways your aliens could do something similar to the environment people live in. Modify sperm cells before conception (not strictly "part" of a person), create distortions to vision calculated to cause fatal accidents, transform nutrients, transform the immediate atmosphere, tamper with human knowledge and communication to create harm directly or chaos, or to insert false harmful information into human knowledge, just name it. Imagination is the limit. 

I presume this is a "Hollywood" weapon, meaning the most important thing is to look cool, not to be effective. Otherwise, I'd point out that piecing has been known to be the most effective way to use a sword since before roman times. So no, you don't have to even have slicing in your combat style, quad or not. Why quad then? You could explain away this design by claiming it's a "ceremonial" weapon. 

It might be possible. But you have to think outside a few boxes. For one thing. What makes a sun your sun? Do you HAVE to orbit it? We already do exactly this with Polaris. We just don't think of Polaris as our sun. Polaris doesn't exactly keep us warm. But why shouldn't it? Because it's fairly long way away. Any way to fix that? 

Faster? Just faster? Not 5 miles per hour faster? Ok fine. lean out the back and blow hard. Congrats, your going faster. If you really insist on trying to out speed the wind you could just make an oversized blimp, complete with propellers. Sphere isn't the most aerodynamic shape. 

I'd go a different route. Go for modest cash but excessive influence first, money (in excess) later. Here's how and why: Money by itself gets attention. But powerful influential people are expected to gain money, which will shield him considerably. I would look not for stock rises/market shocks, but for people who make sudden blunders, and gradually build a reputation as someone insanely perceptive about what people will do, and the decisions they will make. Become a journalist, pollster, or renowned economic/political voice. Call some major decisions right. Notice illegal actions, raids, major successful speeches, resignations after a crisis, action that will be taken in major geopolitical situations, just a day or so before anyone else publishes, and get them right rather often. Nobody will litigate or arrest anyone for this, and it builds a reputation as a person to go-to for insight in the face of big gambles - will X win an election, will Y back down on some matter, will the head of oil company Z resign, will charges stick, or whatever. With that reputation you can then start to offer consulting services to businesses who want to get a huge decision right, and your own success will then have a context to it which is a lot harder to challenge than just making freakishly lucky investment decisions all the time. 

There's your science. You conduct experiments and make observations. Not everything needs a calculation. 

Living memory is a two edged sword. Sure they have the wisdom of ages but they also have the bigotry of ages. They remember that your great great great granddad still owes them money. Imagine a grudge that lasts as long as some religions. Set in their ways just doesn't begin to cover it. They need the young to drag them kicking and screaming into the future. Now you humans get off my lawn! 

Is it ok if I have my stomach on the outside? It's what humans do when they cook after all. Let's invent lithotroph agriculture. You're macroscopic organism eats "rocks" by running over them like a lawnmower, just a little slower. As it passes it takes it's harvest while picking lithotrophs up from consumed rocks and laying them down on fresh rocks. Leaving a trail of devastated rock surface to mark its passing. Key here is it doesn't drag them forward. It pushes them sideways. Leaving behind lithotrophs to grow on fresh rock until it returns. Thus making your organism territorial. Bit of a symbiotic relationship really. Lithotrophs gain mobility. Macroscopic "rock eater" gets to eat "rocks". 

The power can be used to ensure he is given credit for major successes and is seen as the fair recipient of benefits, by courts, powerful people, and so on. In most countries, power is closely related to money, and those who don't have large-scale power already, may gain it through their money and business influence, this seems a good place to start. Also it means he doesn't need to influence many people, or obviously, which is going to play to his strengths. 

Mistakes or issues facing other competing countries Suppose you want to trade with a country, but they become chaotic or move towards unstable/dictatorial government, or get hit with sanctions blocking trade. Some nearby country might be the best place by far to substitute for it, when people have to leave or cut ties with one country, but want to remain in the area with minimal disruption. Often it's others mistakes more than ones own cleverness that counts. A small country might well become important (economically or strategically) due to it's location near some zone of interest, or issues/interest in a nearby country where others want to be "near but not in it". Examples freely adapted from historic situations: 

Getting feet confused with meters and screwing up your reentry plans. Resulting in a fiery death. Close encounters with space clutter. Resulting in violent death. Overestimating how long equipment will remain functional while you're in stasis. Resulting in eternal sleep, AKA death. Technological advancements while you're in stasis. Resulting in being salvaged for scrap by faster ships that put you on display in a museum, after 'accidentally' causing your death. Actually making it where you're trying to go and finding no one else survived and nothing interesting to do. Resulting in being bored to death. 

Things you can do when you're absolutely certain about the future: Buy insurance. With enough money and a narrow enough definition you can get pretty good odds. Start a cult. You don't care about seeming nuts. You care about getting people to do things. Be careful to tease apart what you know and what you assume. UFO's, saucers, and humanoid aliens walking about are all that have been foretold. Not our extinction. It may be that what you really need to do is prevent earth becoming a tourist trap. 

The odds are good nobody will investigate. If they do, its much easier to hide - you run a mine or recycling business which will fully sustain examination and is just very successful. For computer parts, few people buying recycled ex-warranty parts which work, will ever check the serial number even if one exists. The advantages are that the business is legitimate, and the product unpredictable and down to skill and luck. You can sustain investigation and keep your power hidden. 

His power's main weakness is the distance limit. Is he a complete reclusive hermit? If not, there will be places he goes even if only occasionally,which are more than 20km away. Any amount of preparation can be made to kill him in any place more than 20km from where he is at any given time. So if he visits a sick relative or a fellow criminal more than 20km away, if one of his kids (if any) or his mum or some relative is deathly ill, in trouble, or badly hurt, or something else happens that takes him 20km away, your assassin has an easy time of it. Update to elaborate on this He can't tell what someone did in the past, only what they are doing now. He can't read intentions, only actions. Very likely, he travels, or has a friend or relative or somewhere he goes more than 20km from home. If needed arrange a traffic accident for his out of town mother, or a serious sports accident for his kid, or just wait till he goes to his favourite hotel or whatever he does for vacations, or buys something from a regular supplier not in the same town. He cannot know what has been done in those remote locations. Plant a lethal device in the place he's enticed, with a wifi based trigger, and a nearby webcam to keep an eye on the scene. Then create your enticement or wait for his arrival, and retreat 20km. When he's visible in the webcam, trigger the device. Nothing will give away the explosive placed under the driveway, the poison spray in the airvent, or whatever else you choose, because at no time is he within 20km of anyone doing any action that would catch his attention. 

Explosive decompression not your thing? At Willy's used force fields we stock the latest in dynamic envelopment technology. So smooth it didn't even wake this sleeping baby! "Shush! Don't wake the baby." 

Why risk wrapping the rails around the sun by going to mars? Let's go to Alpha Centauri so the orbits of the planets are trivial when compared to the distance between. Now stretching is a non issue. Just have that pesky speed of light to deal with 

Willy sells only the best! Won't stand behind his product though. Likes it better inside where he can breath. All sales final. 

So we use counter intelligence measures. Compartmentalize. Assume a leak. And use at least 3 people. 

Because shit happens Careful reading of the body of this question shows that the world isn't something the machines happened upon. It's something they built from scratch. So, given that they could fight the whims of fate and force their world to have whatever tilt they pleased why would they give it any tilt at all? Either they like having a white christmas or they did the math and figured out that the energy it was going to cost to get the perfect tilt could simply go into home heating and construction of lightning rods. This would mean the tilt had a tolerance. Once the tilt was within tolerance they moved on to making sure the fjords looked nice. And maybe they just got the math wrong. Building a planet is one thing but weather prediction is another. 

Theocracy makes sense if something is to be gained by it. Quite possibly nothing will be - in that case it won't have a compelling reason to be the form of government. Example - perhaps humans figure out that actually, (a) gods exist but (b) they don't seem to want or seek anything from humans, or offer anything to them. Urban foxes know cars exist, we know volcanoes exist - the presence of forces beyond our own, doesn't seem to automatically command a religious approach to them. (While we did worship volcanoes, its worth noting this was at best, only when we assumed it would achieve something, or when there wasn't a better object of praise around the diesphere...) Gods may also have agendas far different from humans', so that what they do and care about is completely lacking in human relevance in most cases. Perhaps all one needs to know of the gods is how to recognise when a divinely initiated event is likely to happen so as to not be in the vicinity (think tornado warnings - "yesterday Odin turned the sea blue near the city, residents advised to leave for the hills for a week in case of some untoward event')
