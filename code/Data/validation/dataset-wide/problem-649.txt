While this won't tell you what areas simply have bad pavement, avoiding these areas will at the least help matters. NYC Bike Map The impressive NYC Bike Map will help keep you to areas that are more suitable for cycling. However, from experience, I can tell you that not all of these have suitable pavement for skinny tires. (For example, the East Side Greenway is shown in green, and while it's quite rideable, the surface isn't the best and the path has many corners and even a staircase. At least, this was the case a year or two ago, the last time I rode it.) 

It's worth noting that commutes of a mile or two may not require changing at all, but you'll still have these things to deal with in very hot or cold weather, or when riding in the rain. (Edit: Your 6k commute is a bit long for this, but it's still good advice in general.) Best of luck on the commute! Speaking from personal experience, I recommend allowing a lot of extra time the first few commutes, and also doing a dry run of the route (if you haven't already). Also consider talking to any cycling co-workers: Some of them may have solved the problems related to your specific workplace. 

Which grips you get for a mountain bike is mostly a matter of comfort and personal taste. In terms of how they attach to the bike, there are grips that glue on and grips that screw on. They're exactly what they sound like. Locking grips (that tighten onto the bars with an allen key or a screwdriver) will avoid the grips twisting over time. You can also get "ergonomic" locking grips. I had a pair of these and found them quite comfortable, and again, this is a matter of personal preference. (I also found that they reduced fine control just a little bit.) Some even come with smaller barends built-in. 

Rim The circular, U-shaped (in cross-section) part of a bicycle wheel that the tire and spokes are is attached to. Wheel-building is the process of attaching a hub to a rim with spokes; the name has connotations of smaller runs of wheels that are not machine-built, and are of presumably higher quality. 

I've noticed that getting repeat punctures can simply be a sign that your tires are past their useful lifespan. I went on a long tour and had no flats for weeks on end, but then once my touring tires passed the 2000 mile mark, I got two flats in two days. I replaced my tires and had no flats again for weeks on end, and again when the tires passed the 2000 mile mark I got a couple flats in as many days. My story is only a couple of data points, but there does seem to be some consensus that tires simply wear out after a fixed distance -- though that distance depends on make, air pressure, rider weight, etc., see here and here. 

Also, on a fixed gear, the length of your crank could be important : If you're taking a tight corner, you might lean over far enough that the bottom of the crank scrapes the road as the pedal turns, which can lead to a wreck. You can get a crankset that has shorter arms to avoid this, though if you're not into tight cornering it might not be a problem. It's something to be aware of though, since you never really know when you might need to pull an emergency maneuver. Other stuff Once you've gotten the rear wheel and drivetrain set up, you're technically good to go. You can opt to switch many other things on your bike, but chances are that it already has a seat, headset, fork, handlebars, etc. 

Fantastic ! Building a fixed gear conversion is a lot of fun. tommy_o gives a great list of all the parts that go on a conversion, but when I try to imagine what it's like to have an old bike that you want to hack on, I think it's helpful to imagine what you'll have to change about your bike, so I'll give that a shot. As long as the existing bike is in decent shape, you actually have a lot of freedom in deciding whether to get new parts or reuse existing ones. At a minimum, though, you'll need a new rear wheel, and then from there it gets more and more up to you. Wheel You can either buy a wheel, or build one yourself. I've found that buying is actually cheaper, but I think it's a good exercise to build at least one yourself to see how it's done. Either way, like tommy_o mentioned, you'll need to pay attention to the size of the rim that you want to get. If your bike has 27" wheels and you decide to get a 700c rear replacement, then you'll need to be ok with having different size wheels, or you'll also need to get a new front wheel. If you decide to build, you'll need to buy : 

I'm extremely sensitive to handling and balance when I have my kid in the bike seat. The child is already moving around, I don't need anything else throwing the bike off-balance. If I had to set up a bike so I could carry her bike back home (which may be coming soon for me), I'd definitely look into a bike that had a kid seat and a cargo trailer. That way the kid's bike could go in the trailer and the child in the seat. Cargo trailers are also very useful for grocery runs, errands, and picnics. There are many available, and sometimes you can even find used child trailers that you can repurpose. 

Over the Hills, by David Lamb Not related to Canada, but this book a great first-tourer story; it also encouraged my own interest in touring -- along with John Doesey's wonderful tour journal, the first one I ever read. Over the Hills is a memoir of a middle-aged journalist’s 3000-mile "afternoon ride". The book is well-written, fun to read, and strikes an excellent balance between travelogue, personal memoir, and barely disguised worship of middle America’s relaxed way of life. The author is decidedly not part of bicycling culture. He wore ordinary-looking clothing on his trip, ate in ordinary diners and truck stops, and stayed in ordinary hotel rooms, with his bike standing by the side of the bed. Mr. Lamb is very much a character in his own story. Funny story, from the middle of a Boston to New York City tour: I was pushing my way up a hill on the way to a repair shop, and chatted with a guy on a motorcycle; he started to describe this book, and I interrupted him, asking if it was this book. We both laughed; it was a bonding moment. I learned a few things from this book: To keep my hands loose on the bars when going over grooved pavement, that it's not "cheating" to accept a ride to get past an onerous section of interstate, and that talking to strangers is just plain fun. 

(photo credit) That's twine and zipties holding it onto the bar. A few miles later, the maglite died. I rode in the taillight of the guy I was riding with. Then it started hailing. We had no experience riding on slush so we called for help. (I've since ridden on ice, but I was young and not yet stubborn enough to tough it out.) These days, when I'm on tour, I bring along those lamps you put on your head on a strap. I use them as reading lights in my tent, but they also serve as backup headlights. 

If you're bringing a camp stove with you, I highly recommend lentils and rice for dinners. They're non-perishable and very light when dry, take just 20min to cook, and they're easy to find (and cheap) in grocery stores or even convenience stores. You're sure to pass at least one tiny store every 2 days on your trip, so you don't actually need to carry that much on your bike at once. In addition, lentils and rice can be improved significantly by adding vegetables and salt, and I found that adding some high-quality canola oil made them taste significantly better, in addition to providing critical extra calories during a tour. For breakfast, I usually had oatmeal of some sort. Like beans/lentils and rice, they are easy to find, non-perishable, lightweight, and cheap. They are similarly improved by adding things like dried fruit, trail mix, peanut butter, etc. For daytime snacks, I am something of a Clif bar addict, so I tended to carry a bunch of those on my bike. These, or similar energy bars, are also easy to find these days in grocery and convenience stores basically nationwide. I also had a lot of trail mix of various sorts -- almonds, peanuts, walnuts, sesame seeds (surprisingly high in calories), whatever you come across. Stay away from chocolate in your mixes, though, because it melts quickly (unfortunately) when you're out in the heat. (Amusingly, though, I found that keeping chocolate in my northern panniers -- I was riding west so these were the ones on the right side of my bike -- kept it significantly cooler than the southern side.) Also, depending on your budget, stop whenever you can to partake in the awesome diners that you're sure to come across ! I had a lot of fantastic home-made pie on my trip, which hands down beats granola bars and lentils and rice. :) 

For riding in the rain, I would definitely recommend putting fenders on your bike that cover as much of the wheel as possible. This will help prevent "skunk stripes" on the back of your clothes due to dirt thrown up by the rear wheel. Fenders also generally help keep water from flying all around during riding, which keeps other things from getting as wet to begin with. I'd also recommend putting a plastic cover on your seat, as (a) wet seats tend to stay wet for a long time, and (b) keeping your seat dry will help extend its usable lifetime. For this, you can simply tie a plastic grocery bag over the seat -- it's not very elegant looking, but it works well as long as there aren't any holes in the bag. Make sure the bottom of the seat is covered as well as the top. For the drive train, it's difficult to keep this part of the bike dry during rainy weather. You could look into getting a chain guard, but these are typically designed to prevent dirt and grease from the chain rubbing onto your leg or pants, not to keep the chain dry in the rain. It might help keep rain off from above, but it won't help keep things dry from below. You might also prophylactically keep your drivetrain dry by using a wax-based chain lubricant before you go out in the rain. This will help repel water during the ride.
