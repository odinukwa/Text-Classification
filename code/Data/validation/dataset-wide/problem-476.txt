I think that the answer to this question is not "how fast can you safely go?", but rather to look at the inverse, "how fast do you need to safely stop?". If you are on a long road with no side roads, and no chance of animals, dirt, gravel, stopped cars, braking cars, etc, then your maximum speed is very much a personal decision. As others in this question have mentioned, there are others who have almost certainly done it faster! However, in the real world where you do need to deal with some of these things… coming off of your bike at 40mph, is going to hurt… at best. Braking at those speeds is also going to be challenging, and, just like in a car, the faster you are going, the longer it takes to brake. And this is not a linear relationship. Add to that your brakes won't work as well anyway, since you also need to fight gravity when you are on a hill. 

My commute has always been about that distance, and when temperatures reach around freezing point, I simply wear a ski jacket which has ventilation shafts under the armpits. Opening these helps me a lot from sweating, and you can easily adjust them. Also thin (e.g. running) gloves can help: they break the cold wind, but allow you to transpire. And finally, like in warm weather: don't rush too much. 

There do exist child seats that support higher weights, for example this one: $URL$ I rembember this style of seats to be very common in The Netherlands for kids up to ages of 8 or so (although they often also cycle on their own). This does require a bike with a rear rack that actually supports that weight too, and I don't know about availability outside NL. 

In my experience with various internal gear hubs on Dutch bikes, I found there's no maintenance necessary: I've never heard of them breaking down because of lack of maintenance. Here's a blog post that concurs. My current Gazelle bike manual also does not explicitly mention any maintenance on the hub gears, only how to adjust them. 

SRAM Rival (50/34) Shimano Ultegra (50/34) SRAM Red/Rotor 3D (53/39) Shimano Dura-ace/Rotor 3D (53/39) 

As I also added in a comment on the question, it would appear that the premise behind the original question no longer the holds true. That is the Cervélo S2 2011 specs now include a 53/39 crankset, the same as the S3. The three pre-configured configurations on the S2 come with: 

Edit: Curiously, I seem getting getting different results to other people. I can view the S1, I just checked the link again, and it works for me, it also gives prices in AUD. It also works for me from a Dutch host, and gives prices in EUR. Perhaps it it is not sold in your region and that is why you get the 404? Using googlecache I can also see the S1. As to the S2, again, using the googlecache link I can see that the US has both a 50/34 and a 53/39 setup. The four configurations from that link are: 

This depends greatly on the type of bicycle: a Dutch type commuter bike requires very little maintenance. Simply checking tire pressure weekly/monthly and maybe lubricating the chain once a year will keep it in good conditions for years (with minimal repairs needed). The reason is that very few sensitive parts are exposed to weather and outside conditions: completely covering chaincase, internal hub gear, hub dynamo, etc. My feeling is that it does help a lot to store the bike inside or at least under a roof to better protect it from rusting. 

I'd say buy a modern Dutch city commuter bike: except for a Gates Carbon Belt Drive (never heard of), they have all the listed specs, are indeed very low maintenance (having an completely enclosed chaincase helps a lot) and will cost you about 600 - 700 GBP, evering included with wheel lock. Well known, good quality brands are Gazelle, Batavus, Sparta, and there are at least two shops in London that sell Gazelles (I bought mine at one). 

For myself, I would choose the road with the bike path. The start/stops are annoying, but in general a road with the bike path will have more cyclists, and so the motorists will also be more used to dealing with them. Additionally, you will have the extra room on the road, which also makes it less likely that someone will cut in on you while trying to pass. Lastly, riding on a dirt shoulder is fun the first few times you do it, but it wears pretty thin pretty quick in my experience. Mountains are where mountain biking should be done IMO ;-) How to choose a route? For myself, I look at the local department of planning for the bike routes and/or bike lanes that are available. I don't mind riding a little longer to be on a dedicated bike path, it is much friendlier to ride, even than a dedicated bike lane. Failing that, I look for the bike lane, and then "quiet" streets. In my experience, riding down a busy street without a bike lane can be pretty hairy. I have had motorists who think that it is funny to try and scare you silly. After all, you are riding on their road. 

There's a very simple way to accurately estimate this: use Boyle's gas law which states that the product of pressure and volume is constant. Thus if the air volume in your tire decreases by 10% (which I think is a huge overestimate), then the new volume V2 is 0.9 times the old volume V1. Hence the new pressure P2 must be 1/0.9 = 1.11 times the old pressure, i.e. pressure increased by 11%. I'd conclude that pressure is barely affected by the weight of the person, if the tire has enough pressure to support you in the first place. 

Drafting is very well possible depending on the environment. In The Netherlands it is not untypical to have significant parts of your commute on stretches of cycle paths that are straight, free from car dooring risks and without side roads (or at least ones over which you have priority). I find that at speeds of 25 km/h and above, when you stay less than 1 meter away from the draftee, there is a significant benefit. On the other hand, by riding slightly staggered behind the other person, you can watch the road ahead and anticipate any abrupt maneuvers.
