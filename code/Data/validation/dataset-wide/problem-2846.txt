We know that we can see distant galaxies only billions years before now. We can observe the nearest stars just several years before the present. Something on the Moon can be observed only some seconds in the past. Continuing this scale, is there an object in the universe that can be observed just now, at present, or at least closer to the present than any other object? I suppose such object should be located in the brain of the observer, but where in the brain exactly, given that brain has finite dementions. The question can be formulated differently: where exactly is located the center of the sphere of the cosmological event horizon for a given observer? 

You can conceive a universe where usual logic would not work, for instance, a universe where everything you believe or want or fear is true, or a universe where there is no logic, only some constant permanent sensation, but it will not be universe in the usual sense (it would not be possible to describe it in formal language). But if you take the level of the most abstract qualia, you can conceive a qualia flow that would break usual laws of logic. In a sense it would be somewhat similar to a sleeping dream or being under drugs. So, if you consider such deep modification of reality as modifying the basic qualia (and not just changing the physical laws), as a different “universe”, yes, it is possible. In sort, if we consider the universe as some kind of qualia flow, we can construe another flow with different logic. Yet we cannot construe a universe with different logic by just modifying the laws of physics. You should also note that this will require changing not only sensory qualia such as vision, but more subtle ones, involving thinking and memory. 

You are right. There is a part of universe which cannot be measured. The impossibility to measure this "last particle's" properties is known as subjuctive (de)coherence. In simple words, the observer can measure everything except himself. In each system that includes the observer there are states which the observer cannot distinguish however means he employs. You can see it as if the states were functions of themselves. This fact holds for any physical theory, but in quantum theory it is stronger than in classical.

Peter van Inwagen in his "Metaphysics" (2009) explains point of view that both determinism and indeterminism (which he understands as randomness) are incompatible with free will. He concludes that as such, free will cannot exist or merely an illusion. 

It should be noted that there is a chance that can save the free will. A research by Thomas Breuser concluded that neither deterministic, nor indeterministic universally-valid theories are possible. That means that no theory can predict (even probabilistically) the future of a system which contains the observer himself due to self-reference problem. As such it seems that the free will of at least the observer can be saved while all other people will appear to him as following the laws of deterministic or random theory and as such, not possessing free will. Particularly, regarding quantum mechanics Breuer proves that a system which includes the observer has states in phase space which are in principle cannot be distinguished by observer himself however good measurement devices he would employ. Yes these states affect the future evolution of the system. This can be understood as that there is hidden information which real but unreadable by any physical device which affects the future behavior of the observer.

I think that something that makes humans unique is that we have self-contradicting thoughts. For example, almost universally, we try to reduce manual labor (and hence, the invention of robots, right? :-)). At the same time, we do recognize that physical activity is good for good health and try to include it in our lives. If a robot were to be programmed with such self-contradictions, the program would enter into a circular loop and cannot function. 

To me, it seems that we are talking of language being subjective. I think it is the dynamic of language and communication. Language is a tool for communication which implies a certain degree of common understanding between the speaker(s)/transmitter(s) and the listener(s)/receiver(s). In the case of "I'm moving", the listeners are assumed to use the Earth as the reference. Isn't every single word an artificial construct? And, they could even mean different things in different languages. If what we call a "leaf" were to be renamed to "fael" tomorrow, would a leaf cease to be what it is? 

First, I would like to present my understanding of some of the terms. Countries are geo-political entities, that were defined by specific individuals. Not everyone gets to define their own country or other countries. Also, the definition of countries change over time. Illegal entry refers to the entry into a country without in a manner contrary to an entry defined by the law of the country. In a representative democracy, the law, also, is usually defined by certain individuals, and not be everyone. Poverty is a lack or deficiency of personal needs. The amount of money, which is used to fulfill these needs in capitalist societies, is often used as an indicator of poverty. "Poor resources" and "poorly managed moderate resources" are contradictory in that the former refers to "poor resources" and the latter "moderate resources". Similarly, "rich resources" and "better managed moderate resources" are contradictory in that the former refers to "rich resources" and the latter "moderate resources". For argument's sake, let us first consider that the countries have "poorly managed moderate resources " and "better managed moderate resources". The management of resources, again, rests not equally on all individuals in a country. It follows, therefore, that not everyone participates in the definition of "countries", "laws", and "management of resources". At the end of the day, if an individual is in so much poverty (has very little money), then the definitions become irrelevant to the individual's happiness and the individual does not conform to them anymore. This could possibly be the background of individuals who enter a country illegally. I have not experienced it firsthand, so my statements are only conjectures. The "members of a population from Country B" (let's call them, Population B), who may conform and live by the definition of "countries", "laws", in general and their country and their laws, in particular, would probably think that it is the illegal entry of the "members of a population from Country A" (let's call them Population A) is not just illegal, but also unjust. Thus, the tricky part is to find a solution that would both address the poverty of Population B as well as the illegality and injustice against Population A. Now, let us analyze the next statement regarding the resources and their management. In a globalized world, resources (materials, finished goods, and knowledge) are exported and imported among different countries. The price is determined by the buying country and the selling country, demand, and supply. Thus, even countries with less resources can be rich, depending on what type of resources they have. Once they have an economic advantage, it is easier to build upon the economic advantage more and more. The exports and imports are controlled by individuals who manage the resources. By exporting resources to other countries, these individuals gain economic benefits. However, it results in more and more poverty of Population B. Thus, we can see that if all populations would like to conform to geo-political boundries identified as the countries, and avoid illegal immigration, then
