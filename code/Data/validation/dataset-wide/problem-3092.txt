I'm very much late for this "party", but Portuguese nobility wore doublets (or their precedents, as the doublet only hit full force in the last quarter of the 14th century and many men still wore the older surcoat) made of linen, silk or fabrics woven with both linen and silk. There were wool fabrics too, but that was more common for winter. Naturally, poor folks might have a single outfit to last them a whole year, which would mean a linen chemise and everything else wool. But Portuguese imagery show peasants working the fields in the summer wearing only white chemises as a way of dealing with wool vs. hot Portuguese summers. In conclusion, I am not so sure about the fabrics worn by the men in the lower ranks of an army, but nobles would have definitely worn linen (with or without silk depending on their social standing) doublets (and surcoats). 

There were equivalent proclamations. By the end of the 13th century, king D. Dinis of Portugal had organised a body of crossbow archers in every town. All body able men were enlisted and forced to practice regularly. Fines would be paid if enlisted men failed to participate in those regular, public practice sessions. It so happens that Iberian kings were under the impression that the crossbow was superior to every other type of bow in impact power and precision, for as long as they could find well-trained people to do the job. Obviously, shooting arrows was not deemed a noble art so it was a job for the peasants. 

As mentioned in the comments, the exterior shutters are an old tradition in southern Europe. They can be basically wooden boards that are opened and closed, or they can have open slits. The first type effectively protects the window from the eyes and intruders but doesn't let the sun in. Typically, when these are closed, it's night or the owners aren't in. In Portugal, they are considered quaint but are common only in old (think 50+ years) one or two storey houses. Another common type it to have thin open slits. These are less solid for preventing break ins, but they let air and light in. If the window is facing the summer sun, it will naturally be kept close against it without impeding normal activity inside the house. Typical in old houses (30 something years) in some areas. Then there are shutters composed of thin strips of wood organised in diagonal to form tiny open diamond spaces. These are not common and will be seen only in areas of ancient moor influence, whether regionally (say Southern Portugal) or in city areas that were, in medieval times, consigned to people of this religion. The architectural tradition remained after the last moor disappeared. But it's still not common. In Portugal, these exterior shutters that work like 'doors' are a species in sharp decline. Most people prefer exterior shutters that are large strips of PVC and can be rolled up and down at will, whether to just make way to little openings to let air and a bit of light in, or to shut close completely. They often have a little crank that allows the homeowners to lock the shutters and avoid anyone from coming in. Link to traditional shutters; in English Link to PVC shutters; in Portuguese, but just click on the images to see what they look like. In short, the traditional shutters are a protection against intruders, interested neighbours' eyes and the sun and go back to when houses didn't have window panes. To still use them depends on a love for traditional things and not having a good practical and estetic replacement. 

I know films and historical accuracy are, unfortunately, enemies, but a couple of years ago I saw a film that included a family living in close quarters in a cabin and they all slept on cots on the floor to the exception of the parents. Recently, I looked through some pictures of real life (old) cabins and they featured bed structures that kept the mattresses / cots off the floor. Example 1 example 2 Was there a reason for this? Was sleeping on a cot on a cabin floor too cold (at least in Canadian and Alaskan winters) in real life? Or would big families have beds only for some and the rest would really sleep on the floor? 

There have been several dukes whose titles match their surnames. These include Frederick Schomberg, a German-born general who, at various times, commanded forces for France, Brandenburg and Portugal. In 1673 he was invited to England to plan and lead an invasion of Holland, which was cancelled. He later did the opposite, accompanying William III in the Dutch "invasion" of England and was killed at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690. In 1689 he was created Duke of Schomberg, in the peerage of England. Phillip Wharton was created Duke of Wharton, in the peerage of Great Britain, at the age of 19, in 1718. Charles Lennox, the natural son of Charles II, was created Duke of Lennox, in the Scottish peerage, in 1675. In Scotland, if a name and title are the same the phrase "of that ilk", meaning of the same name or place, is sometimes used. Sir Iain Moncrieffe, baron of East Moncrieffe, for example, was known as Moncrieffe of that Ilk. 

The country was divided into counties and boroughs. To vote for county MPs (usually two per county) a man had to own freehold property worth forty shillings per year. This means that it could be let for that amount. Whether it was, in fact, let was irrelevant. Most boroughs also returned two members. The qualification for voting varied from borough to borough. The most democratic were known as "pot walloper" boroughs. In these any man who was able to boil a pot in the town, that is anyone who had his own hearth, was entitled to vote. In such boroughs the form of tenure was irrelevant. Some boroughs used the "scot and lot" system. This meant that only those who paid certain church and poor relief taxes could vote. The obligation to pay these taxes was often linked to membership of merchant guilds, which in turn gave people the right to trade or carry on certain occupations within the town. In effect, those with the right to traded or do business in the town were able to vote. In some boroughs the "burgage" system was used. This meant that anyone who held property in the town on a yearly rental, either directly from the king or from a specified local lord (depending on the borough), was entitled to vote. The holder of such property might or might not personally reside there. The property could be sublet, and the right to vote might be let with it, let separately, or retained. The least democratic were boroughs where the "corporation" method was used. In these boroughs the right to vote was held by members of the corporation, which in many cases was self-perpetuating, with new members being appointed by existing ones. In many cases the corporation was responsible for aspects of the town's administration, but in some there was no town, merely a self-perpetuating group with the right to elect two MPs - these included the Rotten boroughs. Another system involved "freemen" of a town having the right to vote. In some cases freedom of a town was inherited, or granted automatically to apprentices, and/or at the discretion of the corporation. There were instances of large numbers of new freemen being created just in time for elections. In many cases a man otherwise qualified to vote could not do so if he was in receipt of poor relief. Generally, only adult male Protestant British subjects could vote. Not everyone who had the right to vote had the opportunity, at least not often. Very many MPs were returned unopposed. Nobody might choose to stand against the nominee of the major landowner. In other areas once an MP was elected to one Parliament, if he wished to continue he might be elected unopposed to successive parliaments until he chose to retire, or gave cause for significant dissatisfaction. Local convention could be important, for example Lancashire county traditionally elected one member of the Stanley family, and one other. Where elections were contested they could be the cause of very great excitement. To vote people had to attend the county town in person and might at the very least expect to be reimbursed their expenses by whichever candidate they voted for. Strictly speaking, Birmingham and Manchester were represented as part of Warwickshire and Lancashire respectively, and in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Warwickshire conventionally sent one MP from Birmingham and one other. Lancashire sent two county members and two each from Liverpool, Lancaster, Preston and Wigan, but none specifically from Manchester. This paper, from the House of Commons library, goes into more detail. As Steve Bird has stated around 3% of the population could vote, which if we exclude women and boys is perhaps close to 10% of the adult male population. The proportion fell somewhat during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century as the general population increased faster than the voting population. 

Actually those that claim they had a bit of an idea seem to not have read the notes of the targeting meeting. The primary selection of a target had to have certain requirements and the first one being psychological - they wanted to end this war quickly. The fact is that the United States had three such weapons at their disposal at the time and wanted to use them in quick succession to give the idea that the United States would use them one after the other until Japan capitulated. Kyoto was selected as the first target because it was a scientific and cultural community where the psychological effects and the power of the weapon could be understood and communicated to those who would bring an end to the war. That all sounds well intentioned to use it this one time and get the attention of the Japanese leaders. The only problem with the logic here is the idea that there would be intellectual survivors that could inform the Japanese government and tell them to surrender. Think about that logic for a moment they thought there would be plenty of survivors of this first use of the weapon. So the casualty figures had to be very low. Further Kokura was another target selected and the main target was a complex approximately 4100' long and there concern was to make sure they dropped the weapon precisely on that target so as to destroy it. Again the logic here that they had to be 'on target' with the drop in order to destroy the facility. Again this shows they did not understand the destructive power of the weapon at all. Given this criteria and other information from the targeting meeting notes one could suspect that these people thought hey just a bigger firecracker not a completely destructive weapon. Gathering as well from various sources a number of 20,000 was a plausible number of casualties. However one of the criteria for the target was city size and population figures since as strange as this might sound they figured on studying the effects while they were at it. Certain detonation points were selected for this purpose as well, knowing how many miles out from ground zero they could take readings and measurements. I guess if you are going to do it anyway you may as well know what you have and they used some of this data from the Hiroshima blast to determine effects at Nagasaki; however Nagasaki was limited due to the graphical topology and the fact the bomb was dropped almost 2 miles NW of the intended target location - which spared half of the city. Kokura was the back up target for Hiroshima and they had managed to get just enough of a visual view to drop the bomb on Hiroshima (one of the requirements that was placed on the missions) no use of the radar bomb sighting. Kokura lucked out on the first mission that Hiroshima cloud cover diminished for it to be bombed. The second bomb Fat-Man Kokuro was the primary target it had a large military complex and chemical weapons factories - which were known about by the United States by the early summer of 1945. When Bock's Car arrived in Kokura it was almost one hour later than it should have been and by this time the report of 3/10 cloud cover had changed to 7/10 and the requirement for visual target id caused Kokuro to be aborted and that the secondary target of Nagasaki be attempted - Nagasaki they assumed would have fewer casualties just because of the topology. So now there is a term people use.. they might say you have Kokura's Luck when you dodge a big disaster. Nagasaki was bombed but the target point was about 2 miles off. The crew had poor visibility, and was low on fuel and also was pressed into the mission even though the plane was not in ideal conditions. Originally the 'Great Artiste' was to drop the bombs on August 11th but the mission was moved up to the 9th and therefore the Bock's Car was used for the mission. Taken these things into consideration and looking at the crew logs for the flight it seems to me that they really did not have a clear visual of the target - if they had they would have been at least with in 1/2 to 1 mile of the target or they had to have some extreme winds blowing the weapon off course (unlikely). The following is just my opinion relating to Nagasaki.. Given the pressures to get off the ground on the 9th instead of the 11th, to make the mission even with a bad fuel pump that it was determined the bomb will be dropped somewhere regardless; details about handling of the weapons in the event of a scrubbed mission left out for brevity. Given Bock's car loitered at the rendezvous point for 45 minutes (using fuel) and then they made 3 attempts at Kokura (using more fuel) that a determination was made if they did not drop the gadget while over Nagasaki they would not have enough fuel to return to any airbase. According to the logs one engine ran out of fuel upon landing in Okinawa and they had 7 gallons of fuel remaining. Had they been carrying the weapon Fat-Man they would not have made it to Okinawa. Again I believe they made the determination to say they had a visual id of the target and dropped the weapon using the radar sighting system. Given the options and the fact that they were witnesses of Hiroshima I am sure they figured what is a few miles when the entire city of Hiroshima was destroyed, so to preserve themselves they dropped it. I am thinking if one were to check the variance of radar targeting at the time [SHORAN] - they might come up with at least a 2 mile variance.. Just a hunch the meeting notes seem to suggest this as well. [It was agreed that Dr. Stearns and Dr. Dennison should keep themselves continuously informed as to radar developments. If at any time new developments are available which show in combat a marked improvement of accuracy the basic plan may be altered.]
