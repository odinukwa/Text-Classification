If what you are asking is 'What is the universal difference between English with and English and (or their Russian equivalents, for that matter), the question is wrongly formulated, and unanswerable, because other languages need not, and in fact do not, have lexical items with all the same syntactic and semantic properties English with and English and have. Your question should, therefore, as a minimum, be reworded in terms of a hypothetical (?unique!) difference between a would-be universal ?'conjunction function' & and a would-be universal 'comitative/groupal function' C (in the broadest possible sense of 'conjunction' and 'comitative'). The former, at least, is a relatively safe bet, since no human language can work without something (= obviously, not necessarily an and-like word!) that minimally licenses the expression of 'molecular facts/propositions' like [p & q] (where p, q are propositions that name events or states of affairs). Whether a 'group-forming/comitative' function C is also universally necessary is much less obvious, in my view. However, even that radically abstractive step would not be enough if what motivates your question is the need to understand the situation in Mandarin, where the '?coordinators' we need to render as English and do not really correspond, either in intrinsic meaning or in syntactic category, to English and at all, and where, viceversa, our English ands have to be rendered in Mandarin in terms of completely different things (?prepositions, sentence adverbs, particles, (correlative) verbs, [floating] quantifiers, or even 'zero', i.e.,'pragmatic' devices like sheer juxtaposition, with or without ellipsis for economy's sake, etc.). The obvious problem with English and (and its counterparts in other IE languages) - as opposed to our hypothetical function & - is that, even when it conjoins clauses, it is often far from being a 'pure' propositional conjunction function. A second, related, problem, of course, is that, at surface level at least, English and (like its nearest IE counterparts) can also 'conjoin' DPs/NPs, and, in general, XPs, X's and even Xs, and one of the consequences is that when it 'conjoins' DPs/NPs, it sometimes (but not in all cases!) is close in meaning to the preposition with (and to the would-be universal 'comitative/group-forming function' C). As to the former problem, we can approximate English and to a genuinely universal conjunction function & if we disregard the various 'adverbial' (e.g., temporal, causal, contrastive, etc.) implications that and may have and take into consideration only its truth-conditional contribution as a pure propositional function, which we can do by means of a careful choice of examples, cf. below. As to the second issue, of course, the only way to establish the real import of and as a '?coordinator' of NPs/DPs, etc. is to distinguish between 'surface' and 'deep' coordination, which in its turn entails calculating the 'Logical Forms' of the constructions involved in each case. Consider, for example, the following English cases of 'surface' [NP and NP] coordination and their possible interpretations: (1) John and Mary died. If we adhere to the abstractive strategy of counting only truth-conditional meaning, (1) has only one interpretation: it claims the existence of two death events with one participant each (= John died, Mary died = Mary died, John died). No particular time sequence or 'groupal/comitative' implication between the two deaths can be legitimately deduced from (1), so and is a pure & function here, in spite of the fact that, at surface level, it conjoins two NPs instead of two clauses. (2) John and Mary played the flute. Again, (2) has just one interpretation: it claims the existence of 2 flute-playing events (or sets of such events!) with one participant each (= John played the flute, Mary played the flute = Mary played the flute, John played the flute). Again, no time sequence, nor 'groupal/comitative' nuance, is entailed by (2), so and remains a pure & function here, as well, in spite of being a (surface) NP-coordinator. (3) John and Mary played the piano. In this case, on the contrary, two interpretations are possible. According to interpretation (3a), (3) says that there are two piano-playing events (or sets of such events) with one participant each (= John played the piano, Mary played the piano = Mary played the piano, John played the piano) but nothing follows from (3) as to the order in which each piano playing event occurred. According to interpretation (3b), on the contrary, (3) claims the existence of just one piano-playing event with two participants (John and Mary playing together, four hands). (4) John and Mary married. Again, (4) has two possible interpretations. According to interpretation (4a), (4) claims the existence of two separate wedding events (with four participants = John plus somebody else different from Mary, and Mary plus somebody else different from John), and, again, nothing can be legitimately inferred from (4) as to the order in which the two weddings occurred. According to interpretation (4b), on the contrary, (4) claims the existence of just one wedding, with John and Mary as the main participants (= John married Mary = Mary married John). (5) John and Mary argued, finally, has only one interpretation: there has been just one discussion event (or, possibly, a set of repeated discussion events of exactly the same type) with John and Mary as participants (= John argued with Mary = Mary argued with John), not two discussion events/sets of events with one participant each (John or Mary, respectively). In other words, the 'comitative' interpretation is the only one available here. Now, as far as I know, the Mandarin (?preposition) he2 (alternatively: yu3 or gen1, with some regional variation, apparently) can translate the (broadly) 'groupal/comitative' reading of English and in sentence (5) and in sentences (3) and, possibly, (4) when they have the interpretations (3b) and (4b), respectively, but, to my knowledge, none of them can translate and in sentences (1), (2), or even (3) when the latter has the interpretation (3a), that is, whenever two separate events are involved. To replicate such English (surface!) [NP and NP] coordination cases, Mandarin must resort to other devices which semantically approximate English and (to the extent it reduces to universal &), but clearly differ from English with - or from our hypothetical universal 'groupal/comitative' function C. In particular, Mandarin can use the 'sentence adverb' ye3 (= also, as well) - assuming ye3 cannot be analysed as an intra-sentential conjunction - or, possibly, you4….you4 (= 'both … and…/not only… but also…', provided the surface 'coordinates' are phrasal, not clausal). All other choices, as far as I know, have non-truth-functional (e.g., temporal, concessive, causal,...etc.) implications (e.g., ránhòu = 'and then', háishi = 'nevertheless', 'still', suo3yi3 = 'so', 'as a consequence', etc.), and, to that extent, they 'say' (and imply) more than English and in the examples above. Since my knowledge of Mandarin is only elementary, there may well be even gross factual inaccuracies in the discussion above, but they do not worry me too much, as I expect any factual errors of mine will be immediately corrected by the specialists in Mandarin in this forum. That quick, and necessarily selective, discussion was included here only as an example of the way you could yourself proceed to answer your own question in a systematic way: the real point I wished to make above is just that, provided you look not only at 'surface' syntax, but also to 'semantics'/'logical form', English and and with, as well as Mandarin hé, yu3, gen1 and ye3, yòu...yòu, etc., or even a universal & function and a (possibly) universal C function can, indeed, be easily distinguished. Typological distinctions between and-languages and with-languages in cases of [NP & NP] coordination, on the contrary, in spite of all the nice maps, etc., may not suffice for that purpose unless a 'deep' semantic/LF analysis of all the relevant examples has been carried out before positing such language types. I am no typologist, though, and I do not know whether that has been the case or not, so please do not interpret me as saying anything against typological studies; on the contrary, they are the only way to approach questions like yours, but they must include deep semantic (LF) analysis, not just inspection and comparison of 'surface' syntactic structures. 

There have been efforts to formalize pragmatic knowledge for quite some time now. The main formalisms I know of that attempt to go beyond the sentence-level are things like RST (rhetorical structure theory) and its successors/competitors, like SDRT (Segmented Discourse Representation Theory) (cf Asher & Lascarides, 2007) or D-STAG (Discourse-Synchronous TAG, an attempt to integrate discourse analysis into the TAG syntactic formalism, cf Danlos 2008). These formalisms are geared toward text coherence, discourse relations and inferred relations within discourse, and as such, they seem to fit especially the third problematic you give as an example. These formalisms are all about how propositions within a text are connected together to form a consistent whole. As for your other two examples, knowing that "A above B" implies "B under A" seems to me to be more of a formal semantics question : are those two propositions strictly equivalent ? They seem to be, and as such they should be represented by the same logic formula. I think it's a very straightforward case, much less tricky than say, temporal relations, which require some kind of event based semantics. In this case, any kind of formal syntactico-semantic framework might be used (e.g HPSG). And regarding "popular metaphors", I think it's pretty likely that if they are popular they are lexicalized to an extent and thus can be integrated seamlessly in syntactic paradigms as fixed expressions . I think the bigger challenge is the case of metaphors which are not popular, which are incidental, and there are active efforts on metaphor detection, and efforts to bridge it with formal discourse analysis (for example this paper ) 

The only coherent meaning of grammatical/ungrammatical I know of is 'complying/not complying with the rules of grammar G for language L'. If you accept that point of view, provided you formally specify an explicit, complete, and consistent grammar G of L, you will, by definition, be able to tell whether a certain string of symbols is or is not 'grammatical' in L modulo G (= whether or not it is in the set L that can be formally deduced from G). If you agree to further identify grammatical with correct (= well-behaved modulo the rules of G and, therefore, acceptable as an object of L), then you can also automatically tell whether a sentence is or is not correct relative to G. So far, there is no problem. The problem is that we have nothing remotely approaching a formally explicit complete grammar of any natural language, even if by natural language we meant just 'the state of the internal language L assumed by speaker S at time t,... (replace "..." with a list of parameters encoding all the factors that may condition the state of speaker S's internal 'grammar' G during a specific speech act). Actually, we do not even have anything remotely approaching an explicit grammar of 'the language of speaker S' tout court, with all such parameters abstracted away for simplicity's or idealisation's sake, i.e., we do not have any explicit grammar of any individual speaker S's idealised 'idiolect', approximately what Chomsky once called 'the language of Jones'), and the bad news is that we are not likely to ever have one of those either. Needless to say, we are still incomparably further away from having any formally explicit complete grammar of 'English' (or any other language) as people normally understand the terms English, Spanish, etc., i.e., as the would-be homogeneous 'public languages' millions of people across the world 'share' and use to express themselves, which is the way I presume you understand the object 'English' and the word English. Unfortunately, having the first such grammar of a natural language in that latter sense is not just a question of time and doing much more research; it is simply an impossible enterprise, for reasons clearly explained long ago by Quine in Word and Object and by many others since (Davidson, Chomsky). We will never have an explicit, complete, and consistent grammar of 'English' in that sense because 'English' in that sense is not a scientifically coherent, definable object; it is just a practically convenient fiction, and it is impossible to develop such a grammar for it. Since, unless you first do exactly that, no automatic verification procedure can possibly be designed and made to work, either, the answer to your question, as I assume you intended it to be interpreted, is: "No, it is not possible to automatically verify whether a sentence (of 'English', or any other natural language in the sense explained) is or not 'grammatically correct'." 

In the context of sound-symbolism and indeed the semiotic theories that are discussed in the article, a sign (linguistic or otherwise) is said to be motivated or iconic if its signifier has something in common with what the sign references. For example, a picture of a yellow circle with lines around it is typically used to depict the sun. Because it has some visual properties in common with the sun, we can say it is motivated or iconic, whereas the word sun itself has nothing in common with the sun and is therefore said to be unmotivated or arbitrary. Saussure argued in his seminal Cours de Linguistique Générale that linguistic signs were (mostly) arbitrary, with any apparent motivation the result of coincidences and irrelevant to linguistic theory. Since then, there has been much debate around this issue, with so called ideophones and phonaesthemes cited as counter-examples to Saussure's views, as well as the discovery of the Bouba Kiki effect. 

As we all know, most languages of the world are spoken orally. And there is a number of signed languages, mostly used by Deaf people. But are there any languages which use both modality at once ? Are there any languages that require both gesture and sounds ? 

The organisation of the consonant and vowel tables of the IPA is an approximation of the place and type of the phonemes' articulation. Hence the columns are arranged in order from left to right according to place of articulation in the mouth from the lips to the back of the throat, and the rows are sorted according to their manner of articulation by increasing aperture, from the most closed articulation to the most open, which is why it starts with stops then nasals, then fricatives, then the others which necessitate to open the mouth more and let the air flow more freely. Indeed, if you read Saussure's Cours de Linguistique Général, you'll see that to him, vowels are merely further than consonants on the same aperture continuum. This understanding is now probably a bit dated, but it's not completely wrong either. 

Of course, proud is not an adjunct of I at all (nor 'comes from the verb' in any useful sense); your intuitions are not correct - under any theory of syntax - in those respects. As to the answer above, which you have accepted as satisfactory, although standard in early TGG, it is not compatible either with strict X-Bar theory (since it leaves Spec AP inexplicably empty) or with current assumptions concerning 'locality', in particular with the 'XP-Internal Subject Hypothesis', which requires all arguments of a head to be projected under the head's maximal projection, or with later Merge and Economy-based theories of construction. Since the A proud is a two-place predicate, it projects two arguments (with the Theta Roles of Experiencer/Agent and Stimulus/Theme, perhaps, respectively), and since the PP argument (Stimulus/Theme) of my students already occupies A's complement position, the second argument (= I, Experiencer/Agent) must be projected as a Specifier of A under AP and then 'raised' into the Specifier of T/Infl to satisfy its own Case requirements (recall that in Spec A I would remain Caseless) and 'check' the Tensed copula's own inflectional features (AGR-S, T, ... there have been proposed several technical implementations of this intuitive idea that I will not bother to discuss here). Alternatively, under modern versions of 'Predication Theory' like John S. Bowers', the subject of proud of my students will either a) raise from Spec AP (according to the XP-Internal Subject Hypothesis) but land in the Specifier of a functional PredP category that acts as the complement of the copula and only then continue its ascension into Spec T, or (in violation of the XP-Internal Subject Hypothesis, but in the spirit of early Predication theories like Williams') be initially projected externally to the AP, although not directly in Spec T/Infl, but as a Specifier of Pred, and only then raise into Spec T/Infl (for the reasons already described). Thus, depending on which version of Chomskian Theory you are working with, you will probably have to adopt one of the solutions I discuss here instead of the older and simpler one offered to you by A. Keidan, which, as far as I know, recent Chomskian syntax textbooks no longer consider adequate. 

Here are the names for the eight cardinal directions in Estonian (top) and Finnish (bottom). Lule Saami also seems to have eight noncompound names. However it does not appear to be true of all Saami language. 

There doesn't seem to be an accepted name for this type of bilingual punning. "Bilingual sentence" might seem appropriate, but it would ambiguously describe both the phenomenon of sentences that have the same meaning in two languages, and the phenomenon of two sequences of sound (or graphemes) coincidentally being two unrelated valid sentences in different languages, which is the one you're interested in. A favorite example is the following : I VITELLI DEI ROMANI SONO BELLI. This is said to ambiguously be either a Latin sentence meaning "Go, Vitellus, to the martial sound of the Roman's god", or an Italian sentence meaning "The roman's calves are beautiful". Another Italian/Latin example is : CANE NERO MAGNA BELLA PERSICA! "Sing, o Nero, the great Persian wars!", in Latin "The black dog eats a nice peach", in dialectical Italian. (Translation taken from this page) Wikipedia has a bunch of exemples here. And in here are two poems in Italian/Hebrew As you can see, these examples can be somewhat contrived, as should be expected in wordplay, and they are easier to make up if the languages are closely related. 

What the hearer perceives must clearly be called a phoneme. The produced phone will either be interpreted as the phoneme that the speaker intended, or it will be interpreted mistakenly to be another phoneme. Typically, such mistakes may occur when a non-native hearer, or a hearer of a different dialect, interprets the phone as a phoneme of his first language and doesn't take into account a feature that the speaker takes into account. For example, there's no /a/ phoneme in Finnish, it's either /æ/ or /ɑ/, but a French native speaker hearing Finnish words will interpret both [æ] and [ɑ] as his native phoneme /a/, and hear no difference unless he consciously pays attention to it. This idea that the language influences what we hear has been called the "phonological sieve" or "phonological filter" (I don't know if there's a standard english translation) and has first been put forward by Trubetzkoy and what fdb talks about in his answer is the same phenomenon. Our brains get used to treating some phonemic features as relevant and ignoring others as irrelevant, depending on our first language. Obviously there are limits to this. If the phone heard is phonetically too far removed from the prototypical sound of any phoneme of the hearer's language, it'll be interpreted as gibberish, or even as noise. That's how a European will hear a click.
