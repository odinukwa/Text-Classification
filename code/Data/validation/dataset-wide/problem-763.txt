With all of the above taken care of you should definitely see Jupiter's equatorial belts. They become visible even in 2" of aperture, and a slightly larger instrument should show them pretty clearly, even in a modest eyepiece. Under good seeing, with a perfectly collimated instrument, you can even start noticing the curls and the vortices in the belts even with an aperture as low as 4" ... 6". Jupiter getting more and more blurry as you increase magnification is normal. It's not a sign that the eyepiece is bad. What's not normal is not seeing the belts in a 10" scope. That indicates that either collimation is bad, or seeing is exceptionally bad, or both; typically it's collimation. Your eyepieces should actually give decent performance in the center of the field of view. You also need to let your brain-eye system adapt to the image. You don't have to observe from a very dark spot, Jupiter is bright enough to not require perfect dark adaptation. But your brain and your eye need a bit of time until they can extract all details from the image. Let it drift through the field, stay relaxed, follow the image and just take it in slowly. You will start seeing details after 3 or 4 minutes that were not visible at first (assuming good collimation, seeing, etc). 

The black hole loses mass in order to generate the Hawking radiation. The energy carried by the radiation is exactly proportional to the mass lost by the black hole according to Einstein's formula E = mc^2 No new mass is brought into the Universe this way. EDIT: (Keep in mind the explanation below is not rigorous. As Stephen Hawking himself has said, this is more like a mental model, good enough to visualize things.) Virtual particles are called virtual because they don't really "exist" in the common sense. They have mass and they have energy. Due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, it's okay if particles with a total energy E almost "exist" for a very short while, as long as they return to nothingness afterwards. The production / destruction of virtual particles could happen all the time, anywhere, not just at the edge of a black hole. This is fine, as long as each particle only seems to "exist" a short time. Conservation of energy is not violated. However, at the edge of a black hole, something different happens. You have a pair of virtual particles popping up into existence. Soon after, one of the particles is captured by the black hole, while the other particle moves away from it. Since the captured particle is virtual, it doesn't really have mass and/or energy. No new mass is added to the black hole. Now the two particles cannot re-annihilate each other. So you have one lone particle moving away from the black hole. It's not a virtual particle anymore, it's a real particle. But it has energy and perhaps it has mass also. Where does the energy come from? The energy required to make the new particle real comes from the gravitational field of the black hole. The black hole is losing mass in order to power the creation of real particles moving away from it. Again, don't get stuck in details. This is not what really happens. This is more like a metaphor. 

According to General Relativity, it collapses all the way down to nothing. Not just "very small", but smaller and smaller until it's exactly zero in size. Density becomes infinite. You can't say "Plank length" because, remember, we can't combine GR and QM, we just don't know how. All we have here is GR, and GR says it goes all the way down. I'm using words such as "size" (which implies space) and "becomes" (which implies time). But both space and time in the context of a black hole are very seriously warped. The "becoming" of a black hole all the way down to the zero-size dot is a reality only for the unlucky observer that gets caught in it. But for a distant, external observer, this process is slowed and extended all the way to plus infinity (it's only complete after an infinitely long time). Both observers are correct, BTW. 

In a more general sense: There are telescopes that are specifically made for astrophotography. They have lots of back-focus, they are short and lightweight and therefore can easily be installed on tracking mounts. More importantly, there are tracking mounts made specifically for imaging - very precise, delicate mechanisms that follow the sky motion with great accuracy. In fact, the mount is more important than the scope. A typical example would be a C8 telescope installed on a CGEM mount, or anything equivalent. Barring that, a dob with lots of back-focus sitting on a very smooth tracking platform (probably not as accurate as a GEM, but good enough for many purposes). Make sure you don't exceed the load capacity of the mount. If the mount claims it can carry X amount of weight, it's best if the telescope weight doesn't exceed 1/2 of that amount. Close to the weight load limit, all mounts become imprecise. The exceptions are high end (the most expensive) mounts which cost many thousands of dollars and usually honor their promises in terms of load capacity 100%. Once you have: a tracking mount, a good camera, and a telescope (listed here from most important to least important), you can start imaging various portions of the sky for research. There are 2 main classes of objects that you could image: 1. Solar system objects They're called "solar system objects" but the class includes anything that's pretty bright, not very big, and it's high resolution. Tracking is important but not that crucial. You need a sensitive, high speed camera that can take thousands of images quickly (a movie, basically). These are called planetary cameras. They generally have small sensors, are high sensitivity, and can operate at high frame rates (hundreds of frames per second). As a cheap alternative in the beginning you could use a webcam, there are tutorials on the Internet about that. A DSLR in video mode in prime focus might work, but it's going to do a lot of pixel binning, so resolution would be greatly reduced unless you use a very powerful barlow (or a stack of barlows). You'll load all those images in a software that will perform "stacking" to reduce them all to one single, much clearer image. The scope needs to operate at a long focal length, f/20 being typical, so a barlow is usually required. The bigger the aperture, the better. 2. Deep space objects (DSO) These are anything that's pretty faint and fuzzy, like galaxies, but some comets are also DSO-like in their appearance. You need to take extremely long exposures; usually a dozen or a few dozen images, each one between 30 sec and 20 min of exposure, sometimes even longer. Extremely precise tracking is paramount, so you need the best tracking mount you could buy. Autoguiding is also needed to correct tracking errors. The scope needs to operate at short focal ratios, f/4 is pretty good, but as low as f/2 is also used; focal reducers (opposite of barlows) are used with some telescopes, like this or like this. Aperture doesn't mean much; small refractors are used with good results. The camera needs to be very low noise; DSO cameras use active cooling that lowers their temperature 20 ... 40 C below ambient. Typically they have large sensors. DSLRs can also provide decent results, but their noise is typically higher than dedicated cameras, so you need to work harder for the same results. Specific software is used for processing, stacking, noise reduction, etc. 

Frequencies below 30 MHz have a hard time penetrating the so-called ionosphere - the series of layers of ionized atmosphere that exist at high altitudes. This is good news for folks like me, amateur radio operators, because it allows us to speak into a transmitter at home, and let the ionosphere bounce the radio waves back to Earth, then again up into the ionosphere, and so on, eventually reaching another radio operator on the opposite side of Earth. But it's bad news if you're a radio astronomer trying to receive such frequencies from distant objects - the ionosphere simply bounces those waves back into space. So, apparently, you could raise a receiver above the ionosphere, in a satellite, and have it receive signals from outer space. But there's a catch. At 30 MHz and below, the wavelengths are huge. 27 MHz - the wavelength is 10 meters. 14 MHz - wavelength is 20 meters. 3.5 MHz - 80 meters. And so on, the lower the frequency, the bigger the wavelength. The size of the antenna needs to be comparable to the wavelength if you want to receive signals from one direction only, so as to be able to tell where the signal is coming from. This also helps with efficiency. A very good antenna needs to be much bigger than the wavelength for it to be directional and efficient. The problem is, even with the ionosphere, there's a lot of signal "leaking" out of the Earth, through ionosphere, into space; some of it is bounced back down, but some of it penetrates the ionosphere and escapes into space. A satellite in low orbit would be swamped by transmitters from Earth, completely erasing any signals from deep space. You'd need a humongous antenna to ignore the signals from the nearby Earth. This is not feasible. It would be a lot better if you could just put the Moon in between Earth and your antenna. Even these low frequency transmissions cannot penetrate the Moon, and can't go around the Moon either. So the Moon acts like a screen, casting a shadow on the antenna and eliminating parasite transmissions from Earth. Now your satellite can receive low frequency transmissions from deep space. TLDR: Too much noise near Earth at these frequencies, need to hide the antenna behind the Moon. 

The analogy with the ant walking on a balloon is just an analogy. It's hard to visualize a 3D space in its entirety. Instead, you could visualize a 2D space (the surface of the balloon) and try to figure out what happens then. But never forget it's just an analogy, nothing more. The insect cannot fly off the balloon, because then the analogy breaks. The purpose of the analogy is to show what a 2D observer sees in a particular 2D universe, and then try to extend that knowledge back to our 3D universe. But if your insects are flying around willy-nilly, then the toy is broken and it doesn't do what it's supposed to be doing. Never forget the difference between models (balloons) and reality (the universe). 

yes It may also retard the development of astronomy, cosmology and fundamental physics - especially if they had no other planets and moons. 

Now imagine Venus at maximum elongation - two "hang loose" hand spans. The Sun has already set in the West about 1 hour and 40 minutes ago, so this is during the night, it's dark already, and now the Sun is one "hang loose" hand span below horizon. But Venus is at maximum elongation, which means it's one handspan above horizon. That's quite hight in the sky actually, you can see it pretty well. So, there you have it. You can actually see Venus during the night. Not for long, because it still can't wander off too far from the Sun. It must remain within two "hang loose" hand spans from the Sun, or less than that distance, at all times. So Venus itself will set in the West soon after you see it. It cannot hang around until midnight. Venus also shows phases, just like the Moon or Mercury. I've watched those too in my telescopes. You can get more precise angle measurements if you can use an old-school marine sextant, like captains on ships back in the day. The fist and "hang loose" gesture techniques are just approximations. Or just get a protractor and tape two straws to it at the desired angle, and sight along the straws to estimate the angle in the sky. 

If you're thinking of occasional close encounters, this is very unlikely to work. The approach would be catastrophical for both planets. Their plate tectonics would get completely screwed up. It would kill a whole lot of life on both planets. But it could be possible that two planet-size bodies might coexist very close to each other, so that the tops of their atmospheres would not be separated by a very large gap. It's not clear whether this is stable long term from a gravitational p.o.v. Fluids would definitely migrate towards the stronger gravitational field over the very long term, unless there's some active mechanism (perhaps powered somehow by heat from the star?) pumping them back occasionally. The last scenario is explored in the sci-fi book Rocheworld by Robert Forward. It's sci-fi but it does not stray too far from rigorous science.
