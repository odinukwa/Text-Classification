5. How can I diplomatically get his line manager to take a more hands-on approach? This is really the only question that matters. You approach his line manager, and complain that you don't have enough QA resource. If he asks you about "Q", then you have your opportunity to explain the situation. If he just sends you someone to work alongside "Q", then your problem is solved in a different way. Your question reads to me that you want him to work mostly on important-to-you topics. That is obviously fine, if you are his manager. As you are not his manager, you really need to leave it to them to make clear that the needs of other teams, or the department generally (Slack / wiki) are not as important as yours. 

This most likely isn't what you want to hear, but if you want to salvage this situation, you need to do what you can to earn their respect. Right now, you're in the "problem" column. And that's a bad place to be. Your manager and colleagues are trying to minimise the time they spend with you, because they see this as unproductive time, that isn't helping them to solve problems. You need to do what you can to make yourself useful, as quickly as possible while causing as little overhead as possible. So, I would strongly advise, if you haven't done any or all of this already:

Simply put... Believe it or not... Some people cheat. If the drug test is disclosed up front it gives people who are going to cheat an opportunity to do so. As mentioned in another answer, some people will just clean up for a few weeks before the test in order to pass. Others will try to use one of the never ending commercially available products to try to beat the test. Like it or not, it's a reality and a financial reality too. Sending people to a lab for testing isn't cheap, but employers often get discounts on insurance for doing so. They also do this to limit their liability. If you're ever injured on the job you can expect to be tested. If you fail, you'll lose your benefits and most likely your job as well.

Show some initiative Seriously. You can get the tasks you are assigned done for the week in 15 minutes, so take the opportunity to use the rest of the time constructively. Is everything in the company running perfectly? I doubt it. Almost certainly, there are big tasks / problems that have been outstanding for years. So pick one. Work on it when you have nothing better to do. And when it's ready / nearly ready, talk to a colleague about it. Better still, present to a whole group of colleagues. The worst case is, your solution is dismissed out of hand. But even then, you've still been paid to come to work, and you've tried your hand at a big project. But most likely, if you've solved a real problem the company has had for a long time, you'll get the opportunity to put it live, and get the respect / credit that comes with that. There's really nothing to lose. 

I'm sure there is more, but you get the idea. Do what you can on your own, to make the time you do get to spend with your manager and colleagues more productive. 

You are entirely free to refuse, and you are entirely free to negotiate about it. The company has to honour the contract you originally signed, you are under no obligation to sign a new contract if you do not wish to. And, in the U.K., there are reasonable protections against unfair dismissal, etc. I was in a similar situation, I was given a contract with a longer notice period, I said I would sign it in exchange for a salary increase of £X - the company went away to think about it and I heard no more. Of course, there are those who actively want a longer notice period, as this cuts both ways (if there are redundancies, etc.) But don’t feel stressed about just saying no. 

Get a job in a consulting firm (if possible in one of the Big 4) You have now got yourself access to a truck load of such jargon being thrown in almost every meeting. Keep your ears open. Once in your mind you have figured out what the bottom line is, consciously train your ears to pick up new lingo. Write down all of the new words you hear. Also if you have Word Web or any dictionary, immediately look up the meaning and try to figure out what really the speaker is trying to say. Practice making sentences by connecting these words together. Have a baseline idea for yourself. Then put it in an email with all the corporate lingo you have picked up. Start using these words fluently when talking with friends or family. Expect some weird looks. Watch a lot of movies and read novels. Learn the art of weaving stories and fables around matters of fact and basic bottom lines. This is an art. Almost immediately, you can use some of the words in emails that you send or just by the water cooler (chat). Slowly and surely there will be a paradigm shift. You have rolled your sleeves, worn many hats, hit the ground running, done all the heavy lifting and been the front line soldier for yourself - pretty soon you will be the one talking the talk. 

To more directly answer the question... Keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine. Be honest about your skills in interviews, keep working hard, and keep learning. 

To more directly answer the question... Yes it is harassment, and no it doesn't matter if you're gay. Though unfortunately in a lot of places people aren't protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Your best bet is to get out quickly and consider consulting an attorney after you've secured a new job. 

With that out of the way... I would assume that the higher management is unaware of the issue and would most likely take immediate action if/when they are informed. Even if the law wasn't being broken, a smart manager would have some serious concerns about safety and liability. There's a good chance that the company already has a policy concerning this sort of situation. If I were in your situation I would try to give the manager an opportunity to catch the trainer in the act. If you can manage that, there won't be any question about whether the smoking is happening on the job or after hours. 

I've worked for companies that had policies regarding this sort of thing, but I don't think there are any over arching labor laws. Some of these policies included things like: 

Based on other questions on this site I can almost see why its normal in Asian countries to do this. Although in my opinion it doesn't really make any sense as you could always pull back your resignation and it isn't really hard to fudge an already sent resignation email. So, although strange, I think this really could be the procedure your hiring manager follows and I don't think there is harm in sharing your resignation letter. 

IMO this question is an ice breaker and usually asked in the beginning of the interviews. In replying to this question, I have mostly heard people talk briefly about their education, work/technology experience along with domain (knowledge) demonstration. Achievements and out of work involvement with technology if any (like a certification or an open source project code commit-ter). All of this is sufficient for me when I am conducting interviews for (IT)developer roles and I would think would be sufficient in most interview scenarios. However, if the interviewer needs to know additional details s/he will ask you to give additional details about your family or probably your nocturnal routine. In case if you are from a region where fudging resumes is common place, an astute interviewer might use your answers to cross reference what you say with what you have written in your resume. Of course if you are applying for positions which require security clearance and if it is not just the initial interview rounds, then the interviewer will ask for very detailed answers. 

It's also probably worth mentioning that fiberglass is but one of many potentially hazardous materials in your workplace. I'm sure there are also a number of chemicals, cleaners, and so on, that could also cause serious harm if not handled properly... 

I'm struggling with a direct supervisor, who just doesn't seem to pull his own weight. Basically my supervisor is expected to be a "working manager", so his time is split between 15% administrative tasks and 85% doing the same job I do. I understand that he has admin responsibilities that pull him away from day to day tasks, no problem there, but it seems more and more that the quality of his work in the field is sub-standard. Which leaves the bulk of the work undone, or worse done poorly and the rest of the department is left to scramble to meet deadlines and fix his "mistakes". (To be clear, its not that I just have a high standards, he often scolds the whole department for things that he did, or didn't do.) It seems that any one of his subordinates can accomplish more in 4 hours than he usually gets done in 2 or 3 days. I'm thinking it may be time to make the higher management aware of the problem, before things boil over, but I'm unsure of how to approach the situation. Should I go to higher management with my concerns, and if so, how can I report the situation without coming across as in-subordinate?
