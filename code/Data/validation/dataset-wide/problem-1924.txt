Well, I'd reconsider those choices. I appreciate and respect that you may not want to be on these drugs long term, (I didn't), but in the short term it's part of a necessary treatment to stabilize you and get you functioning better. Therapy may help. It's not a guaranteed cure, but you need to give it a try. Maybe this won't be the right time for it, but keep an open mind. 

This is a very cynical type of behavior and I'd advise you to check if there is something like an employment tribunal in Solvakia which may be able to assist you in addressing this. I would, however, suggest you consider if you want to continue working for someone who is clearly at best an arrogant bully, and at worse a fraud. Personally I'd simply immediately start looking for another job. There is also a legal issue about employers taking actions which effectively force employees to leave - constructive dismal is the term, if I recall. This may become relevant, although I can't speak to Slovak law on this point. Refusing to pay employees, and even the threat not to, could well be considered an attempt to force people out. Regarding the issue of his waiting until after it was late to complain, should this matter become a formal legal case (and I'd encourage you to avoid that - it's typically costly and stressful), there is a legal principle called condonation which can be useful to know of (although it may not be directly relevant here). It's worth learning some of these basic legal principles. I'd suggest you take the "opportunity" this represents to learn the basics of employment law in Slovakia (just an overview, not detail). It will be useful in the future. Once you have a rough idea of where you stand legally you can consider how to address this. I'm not in your country, but for what it's worth I'd simply start looking for a job immediately and when I have one, give notice. If my salary has not been paid in relation to this kind of matter at that time I would write formally seeking the money (registered mail, email and keep a copy) stating my position and roughly what I considered the employer's obligations under contract and employment law were. It's typically not worth employing a lawyer for these issues as costs quickly escalate and we're probably not talking about enough money to make it practical. My limited personal experience with court cases is that people will go to the wire, get to court and be asked to find a settlement by the judge and it's at that point they settle. Usually by that point only the lawyers make any money from it and everyone else has lost. This is another reason why I'd suggest taking the opportunity to learn the basics of how courts and contracts work in your country - it's a good investment and, in my experience, good employers (and you'll get one) will respond well at interviews to people from technical disciplines who can discuss these matters at a basic level. 

This is a very bad notion that I need to address. You cannot do work, paid or free, for another person without your existing employer's permission (unless you have a very unusual contract). And supplying internal documents from your current employers to anyone for money would be grounds for instant dismissal and possibly even accusations of industrial espionage. Giving it for free would almost certainly get you fired as well, for a breach of NDA. Under no circumstances let the idea that being paid creep into your mind as making this reasonable. If there was any discussion of your former manager paying you for this information it is extremely serious and you must tell this to your current employers. Once again, you do not know the full story on why this guy left but you know it was on bad terms. Protect yourself. 

You is the operative word here. They probably can. And they probably will dump your client and you quickly. What your employees might accept : 

Prioritize Which is more important, the interview or the Ph.D defense ? I'd suggest securing the Ph.D ought to be your sole priority. Why would you take any chance of messing that up ? However, you may have your own reasons for preferring to chase the job, and if you have such a preference then you need to at least ask the company for a date after the Ph.D defense. I'd point out that even if you do the interview you have no assurance you'll get anything from it. How much risk is there associated with doing the interview at a difficult time and how much risk to your Ph.D status ? Worse case scenarios : They say no and you decide to skip the interview. There will be other positions. Don't lock yourself into the mental straight-jacket of feeling you have no option but this position. The alternative worst case is that you really put yourself under insane pressure, try and do both and screw both up. 

In view of your edit I feel it's important to make a particular suggestion. Get counseling aimed at learning the importance of social interaction. This would be of immense benefit to you, not simply in work, but outside. 

Really silly thing to say. You've now got direct evidence that they are threatening to fire you if you don't do unpaid work. I don't know employment law in your area, but to see if this helps you you need to speak to someone more expert -union, lawyer, that kind of group. And what is "a valid reason" ? I bet it's "nothing". So what to do ? If you want to fight this you need to get legal advice. There may be agencies that give cheap or even free legal advice to part time works. If you have a union (teaching ?) you may get advice there - even if the union is not recognized by your employer, as long as you're a member. If fighting sounds like a pain the other solution is to get a new job. Honestly, I'd strongly suggest looking for a new job. The fact the owner is now taking such a direct role instead of normal management may be a sign they're in financial difficulty. Owners usually don't get involved at this level unless there's a problem. They'll talk to management and management will work out the details. I'd call this intervention as a "sign of distress". Certainly it's clumsy and I'd bail if possible simply because this is probably going to get worse (how the company is operated). Note : I have a cousin who was a teacher (recently retired) and there certainly is a lot of homework and prep done after hours - lots of hours. However your employer seems to be pushing that envelop a lot more and as you're also part time ( not regular full time staff ) the events as well seem pretty rough. 

Your boss already knows that most likely you won't stay for five years. Also, consider that if YOU said that you had to stay in this position for five years and your boss promoted you anyway, he wouldn't think twice if he had to fire you halfway through this period. So, take the position. If asked about, say the truth. If he hires you anyway, it's up to him to prepare for your departure. If he doesn't hire you, at least you tried. 

As you stated in your comment answering mine, he makes offensive comments face-to-face during work. First, do as keshlam says. Unfriend him. He is a toxic person, avoid contact as much as possible. After that, go talk to your manager. It surely will have no positive effect talking to the offender, so you have to talk to your superior. Explain what is happening and ask him to deal with it. In many places around the world such offences are against the law and might get the offender and the company in trouble. Wait a few days. If it doesn't stop, ask the manager if he talked to the offender. Depending on the response, go to HR. 

All the companies I interviewed for so far didn't try to actually run the code, AFAIK. They just wanted to check the quality of the code. So, as long as your code is good, censor it. Maybe tell them why you censored some of it when you send them the code. 

It's business. You're leaving because you found something better. It they found someone better than you, they would fire you on the spot. 

I've been searching for a new job as a software developer in the last few weeks and have noticed that in every single one of the interviews there's a pattern. First, there's a "get to know you" interview with a HR representative, where I'm asked things like who do I live with, what do I expect of the position I'm being interviewed for, which were my past professional experiences and things like that. After this interview with HR, there will most likely be a techinical interview. The problem is that I'm searching for a job in a specific part of town. To get there, I have to leave earlier (and lose almost the whole afternoon) and come in later (and lost most of the morning), since my current company is kinda far from where I'm interviewing and I need to use public transportation. So, would it be unprofessional, impolite or come off as if I didn't want the job that much if I ask if there really is a need for an in-person interview or if we could use the phone or skype? Edit: I work as a web developer in Brazil. 

If your boss is a person worth not cutting ties with, a simple "Thanks for all the help and opportunities, but I'm off to new adventures" is enough. 

In every company I've worked so far, we had customers. Be it internal or external customers. In this case, she is an internal customer, because she requested something from your department and she is an employee of the same company as you. 

If the company wanted to fire you, it would. No matter what you said, no matter how much you cried. That said, leave whenever you want. Specially if management doesn't give a crap about what you think, as this seems to be the case. This is bussiness. 

If they sent the letter over a month ago and you didn't answer them and yet they haven't tried contacting you again, just pretend you never received the letter. 

You should make it clear to your employer during interview that you haven't had contact or don't know X product or technology. Then it's up to the employer to hire you and wait a little time for you to get up to speed, or just don't hire you. If they happen to hire you and you didn't warn them about this during the interview, it might be very bad to you, because you ommited very important information. Anyway, you have experience with Unix, it won't be very hard for you to gain some knowledge in Windows. Most things are easier to do on it than on Unix. Unless you are apllying for a SysAdmin role, then I suggest you study a lot before hand instead of trying to learn on the go. 

If other employees from other departments do it, and if it is allowed/encouraged by the company, then go for it. You might get some "funny" comments from your colleages the next day, but at least you had fun and did what you wanted. 

I see three options: 1 - Ask the company to buy one, so everybody can use it 2 - Raise funds with your colleages to buy one (we did this with the coffee machine here) 3 - Bring your own, but be prepared to see people use or eventually break it. Anyway, ask your boss or HR first to see if it is allowed to bring your own stuff to the office. 

Depends on your industry. But, since your boss said they dress casual, I'd say that wearing a suit will do no harm nor good. I, as a software developer, have never cared about over/under dressing. I've worked in start-ups, small companies(50~150 people) and big companies (2000+) and in none of them someone said anything about the way I dress. In all of them it was casual. I always go to work with jeans trousers and a T-shirt. But in all interviews I keep the jeans trousers and change the tee for a polo. I noticed that anytime someone overdresses, people make light jokes about that. But, if you work for a bank, for example, you might have to wear a suit and tie. 

What do you expect from this? What do you think would change? What random amount of time do you think would make your quitting less unprofessional? 

Just go on and tell him. You're helping him save money. Were it the other way around, then you would need an excellent document. Edit: If you need help explaining, just say something along the lines of: "Hei b0ss, I know that you're worried about my productivity and wanted to buy that new machine. But I found this 10 bucks cable that will be more useful and way cheaper than a new PC. What do you think about this?".
