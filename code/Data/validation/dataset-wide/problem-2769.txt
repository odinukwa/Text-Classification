See also his book reviews for the New York Review of Books for useful commentary on and critique of his contemporaries, for example, his review of Chalmer's "The Conscious Mind" $URL$ and their exchange: $URL$ Here he reviews several authors: $URL$ The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul by Francis Crick Consciousness Explained by Daniel C. Dennett The Remembered Present: A Biological Theory of Consciousness by Gerald Edelman Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind by Gerald Edelman Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness by Roger Penrose The Strange, Familiar, and Forgotten: An Anatomy of Consciousness by Israel Rosenfield (this is a summary if you are not a scubscriber to NYBR) ...and a resulting exchange with Dennett: $URL$ 

Praising the defense is technically still argumentum ad hominem. In your example the second statements are both "to" the "person" and neither is counter-argument, however, "Bob favors Y" and "Bob favors not-Y" are also not technically arguments in the first place, they are statements of an opinion. So in this instance, there is no logical fallacy of argumentum ad hominem, merely the exchange of sentiments. If an argument is presented (either "for Y" or "against Y") and all that is offered in support of the argument is "the person arguing for (or against) Y is ABC..." then for either there is a false argument to the person. If, however, the argument pertains the merits of the persons character, then ad hominem is apropos. For example: 

But, I am not so deductively certain this form can be cogently induced from the statements above. Are "High government spending" & "The government is spending a lot" necessarily or sufficiently equivalent? Certainly a standard could be established to quantify the former, however, the latter is vague, i.e. "spending a lot" according to whom? King Midas? The last person in line at the local soup kitchen? You?? Also, are we certain that A necessarily or sufficiently causes B? In your textbook, does the author justify their statement? Do they describe or formalize the differences and similarities or at least compare induction and deduction? Hope that helps. 

Gensler may disagree, but this is also not a syllogism as there is no second premise or third term. You can, of course claim it as a syllogism per Gensler's definition but such a construction is hardly even an argument. It's just a redundancy or, argumentatively, an insistence. Stated otherwise, "All A is B" can be represented by "X" and you are simply repeating "X", e.g. 

Primarily, respect for obtaining knowledge (read: philosophy) contends with the non-physical by recognizing the distinction between the physical and the non-physical (see "the excluded middle"). Epistemic limits do not preclude speculation and supposition, nor do they render axiom and self-knowledge invalid, nor language meaningless. 

The term arose from the use of Galileo's trial as an example while making an appeal to pity. It did not come from any particular use by Galileo nor from his preponderance for making appeals to pity. Of note, Galileo was not actually tortured for his views. By today's standards though, the prosecution of a scientist for advancing knowledge would, in civilized parts of the world, likely be considered an ideological persecution. But even then, there are ethical obstructions to advancing certain kinds of empirical investigation. That said, Galileo was shown the instruments of torture. This was a common practice of escalation after the threat of torture was made, prior to actual infliction of pain. 

There is no "philosophical meaning" as both are nothing more than aphorism and as such have no heuristic value. That said, Plato is asserting that just actions have their limits. The desire for justice can go too far such that the administration of law may become unjust. The Shakespeare quote distinguishes "well", as in adequacy to the occasion, in contrast to "better" which is never quite good enough. The two are making a similar point in that "good enough for now" is attainable, whereas striving for something beyond reasoned measure is unreasonable. 

Along with Subjectivity and Intentionality, John Searle, in section 3 ("Some Features of Consciousness") of his article "The Problem of Consciousness" describes Unity: 

Is necessary equivalence sufficient for identity. No. Does necessary equivalence necessarily imply identity? No. Is necessary equivalence sufficient and necessary for identity? No. Is it redundant to postulate that a thing is identical with itself? Yes. Are any two things separated in spacetime the same thing? No. 

...that no, not all actions proceed from this purported need. I might also contend that you consider what is meant by need as, biologically, needs consist of air, water, food, shelter from inclement weather and arguably companionship at a minimum for the raising of humans from a helpless infancy. I think the sense of "need" you have offered is on the other hand, psychological. To Searle's point, it is worth distinguishing what is rational and what may simply be a rationalization when doing something one does not find personally beneficial. 

This argument can also be expressed as, "All M are H. All C are H. All C are M." Note that the two premises share a term (H) and the conclusion is composed of the terms not shared by the premises (C an M). 

On June 22, 1936, Moritz Schlick was murdered by his student, Johann Nelböck. Nelböck claimed Schlick's anti-metaphysical philosophy had morally corrupted him. It is reported as well that Schlick had rejected Nelböcks thesis (see Ray Monk's biography of Wittgenstein). Some additional references: The Murder of Moritz Schlick by F. Stadler, Wittgenstein In Vienna by By Allan S. Janik, Hans Veigl. Two wikipedia articles: Schlick's murder and Nelböck. 

Falsifiability is a criterion for the demarcation of epistemic claims such as hypotheses, as opposed to pseudo-scientific claims which may be based upon observation or observationally verifiable, yet not falsifiable, e.g. "he looks unhappy" or "a giant white gorilla lives in the Himalayas". The problem with induction is logical, as in what kind of inferences may be drawn justifiably from falsifiable statements. 

It might be easier to think of as a sufficiently bi-conditional material non-implication (i.e. a biconditional with an abjunction) - the negation of implication: ¬(φ→ψ) - i.e. the "not sufficient" in "necessary but not sufficient." Not that for terms of logic, "but" is "and". 

As for whether consciousness is real if it is an illusion, Searle suggests that it is very real even if an illusion: 

To be precise, Popper was opposed to the view which equates the scientific method with inductive reasoning: 

To the point of your clarifying comment - every belief is justified by the mere fact that you sincerely believe it. Such is a fundamental difference between statements of belief and statements of knowledge. 

In the first case your meaning is ambiguous - do you mean unlocking past mysteries which remain unresolved, such as the location of Jimmy Hoffa's corpse, or, for example, our ability to conjecture falsifiable and verifiable hypotheses with more than abductive reasoning about such cosmological events as the formation of the Milky Way galaxy? In the second case, at the very minimum with every passing day there are more humans and thus more knowledge. Finally, in the third sense of your question, see below regarding epistemic limitations. From here on out I will also take your meaning of "can we know everything" to be akin to "is there any thing in the world which can not be known?" and not an inquiry into the logistics of actually knowing each and every thing such as the highly mundane, restricted, classified or intentionally obscure such as the position of each grain of sand in the Sahara desert, launch codes for China's nuclear arsenal, redacted passages from the Warren Commission report, laundered monies, etc. Note also my use of (each and) every thing from the term "everything" in the sense of a totality of things. If you are asking could one person or all people know everything all at once, the short answer is no. And this even in an extremely restricted sense of knowledge as empirical verification of what is (which I will describe later). At the very least we can imagine every wave-particle in the universe frozen for an instant in spacetime such that (each and) every thing from the thresholds of sub-atomic blinkering quantum decoherence to cosmological event horizons upon "black holes" (i.e. epistemically obscure whole objects) could be known, but - even if we had such power to pause such a contrived "universe" - in the time it would take to know each particle and its trajectory; every structure and their interactions once known and the universe set in motion again everything will have changed. Would we make a cinema of the world intermittently pausing in between each minimal unit of Planck time for the sake of record keeping? And where would this record be stored? In our memory? Bah. Who has the time or the space to devote to such fantasy except the young or idealistic? Such is the stuff of science fiction and in anycase, you might enjoy Isaac Asimov's short story, "The Last Question" if you have not already read it.
