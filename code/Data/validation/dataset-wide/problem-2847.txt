In an essay entitled "Why I am not a Conservative", Hayek distances himself from both "Continental liberalism" and "English liberalism", while calling himself an "Old Whig": 

Many Christian thinkers are inclined to support moral objectivism. Some atheists, on the other hand, have asserted that the objective grounding of moral statements is conferred by evolutionary biology (I think Sam Harris believes something along these lines). For other views, you can look into David Hume and the logical positivists; moral judgments here are characterized as reducible to emotion (emotivism), or meaningless, respectively. It seems clear to me that emotivism does not necessarily imply relativism especially if the statements in question are thought to have no truth value whatsoever. 

What are the differences between these outlooks? What is a good source of information on this topic? 

I'll try to offer a brief sketch that moves from what I take to be "overarching" (more inclusive) complaints to more specific ones. Please keep in mind that I am, personally, very dissatisfied by most of Postmodern thought; I'm not trying to hide that fact or pretend to distance myself from judgment. Postmodernism, at its most basic level, is a critique of Modernism. This critique is motivated by a dissatisfaction with philosophical Liberalism, which amounts to a distaste for capitalism and an appreciation of individualism, among other things. It's obvious that people who consider these "Enlightenment values" to be good (useful, respectable, fair, successful) will already, at this relatively nascent stage, be suspicious of Postmodernism. This suspicion is not unique to "right-wingers" or what the average American calls "Republicans" because this critique flows from Classical Liberals, Libertarians, many Democrats and everyone who is opposed to most of contemporary Progressivism. Related to this is the Postmodernist's attitude toward science and rationality. Social constructivism, a distaste for "totalizing statements", and skepticism about objectivity, indifference, and progress are very important features here. To be frank, I think a lot of this stems from misunderstanding what these terms mean and what role they play in scientific investigations. "Objectivity" is parsed as "unchanging, universal truths", "indifference" is considered an anti-human (or life-negating) emotion, "individualism" is thought to be identical to selfishness and opposed to solidarity, and rationality is seen as an oppressive tool of the patriarchy. To be fair, I really do think that the concept of objectivity is horribly inflated and mis-used by scientists and lay people, but there are alternatives! We can all be fallibilists about knowledge (even the kind that arises out of empirical and formal efforts) without being skeptical about science and rationality. Another feature is relativism and subjectivism. This is related to constructivism and probably stems from it. Moral judgments are relative to cultural practices and reality itself is sometimes considered as having no residue of perception-independent stuff. Gender fluidity might not be related but the attitude is similar: since gender is a social construct, we can find ourselves anywhere along a spectrum. However, there are alternatives here as well: instead of becoming relativists, we can become fictionalists about morality and gender. As I mentioned earlier, many of these attitudes are the result of misunderstandings ... ones that might possibly arise as a result of not exploring the intellectual landscape very thoroughly. Please don't take this as a complete critique of Postmodernism. I can't clarify all of my attitudes and arguments here, and it's obvious that adherents will categorize these things differently. 

please tell me what is the error not the mathematical error. The error in thinking in this equation don't do the math just common sense. Rember this is the calculation of gravity. Whats missing from the equation? The Newton Force is a quantity that is measured using the standard metric unit known as the Newton. A Newton is abbreviated by an "N." To say "10.0 N" means 10.0 Newton of force. One Newton is the amount of force required to give a 1-kg mass an acceleration of 1 m/s/s. Thus, the following unit equivalency can be stated: 1 Newton = 1 kg â€¢ m/s2 Its gravity he does not have gravity in his gravity equation. Because Gravity would not work so he made up a Newton. It's phenomenon. Newtons says a force must have it pair in reverse. I must be stupid what is the opposite of gravity? Am I missing something? His gravity doesn't qualify under his own laws? 

Well, I can't believe nobody did anything with what I gave you. You make me sad. So I take answer away. you should have tried the solution to the universe was right there in front of your eyes. But it always has been and you never saw it then either. You will see I'm not kidding what I handed you was the absolute mathematical proof that it is all one thing we all come from central black hole all the galaxies are stacked like pancakes on top of one another. I wasn't trying to be a smart ass I really thought you would enjoy solving the universe. But you all have been filled with so much bad science that you did not believe you could do it even when the answer was laid in front of you. I was even going to let the person who did it publish it under their own name. You could have done it any one of you it is so simple. When you see it you will kick yourself. If you get anything from this understand that you can understand the universe. It simple and beautiful a child could have seen what I gave you. But you cant see it. Ask your self why you could not see what I will publish tomorrow when it was right in front of you. Then ask what else you cant see. I need you to be able to see and learn the real universe this is the first step. Im not giving up must be away to clear all this crap out of your head so you can think again. 

This is a false dichotomy; into which category would you place moral fictionalism? To me, it seems to require an independent one. 

The first could be taken as a biological question or a religious one. The second might refer to counterfactual scenarios, to a question regarding the extent of human agency, or perhaps to an inquiry into the question of why a person makes one set of decisions rather than another (if the latter is true, then it's likely a psychological question). The danger I see is attempting to answer a biological, psychological, or religious question in a manner that is uniquely philosophical. Of course, that's not always an easy boundary to discern, but it often amounts to a person conducting some ill-formed study of life (for example) from the armchair. I don't think anyone will get very far if he intends to gather knowledge of mitochondrial DNA or the history of the cosmos by means of pure speculation. I assume that many immersed in the philosophical tradition would classify topics such as counterfactuals and human agency (especially if the latter amounts to a question of freedom of will) as being properly philosophical. David Lewis and Saul Kripke (contemporary professors of philosophy) wrote quite a bit about counterfactuals, and countless philosophers had something to say about the determinism debate (Hume in the 18th Century, and Mark Balaguer this century). Additionally, if your question is related not just to agency in terms of outward action but also to freedom of belief (doxastic voluntarism), many others have commented on the topic: Dion Scott-Kakures, William Alston, and Robert Audi come to mind. Final note: Philosophy does not ask questions, people do. However, I understood what you meant. 

There are many spectrums to light. A human sees a very tiny part of the light spectrum with the naked eye. Less than 15%. When you ask if we see light the answer is no. In comparison to the light, we don't see. I would say no we really don't see it. 

Yes absolutely. You cannot have a universe or anything that is allowed to act outside of the laws of the universe. Or your universe wouldn't be. For instance, everything that you have is nothing. That can start the universe that is a God. Consciousness all the consciousness in your Universe even at the start the simplest thought that is your god. And he's acting within the rules of the universe. To be everything and to be the consciousness he would have to act within the rules and he couldn't do those things outside of the universe laws wouldn't be possible. 

Maybe what we need in this case is what I call internal opposites. That the opposite of the thing is contained within the thing itself. Such as temperature hot and cold. Electricity negative and positive. Magnetism. Centrifugal force. In this case, if you eliminated one opponent you could not have the other. 

That is a really good question best one I've heard in a long time. You had me for a minute, but the clear answer is reality is reality based. It's subjective to The Observer. So you define what is real. A cup may exist. But unless you decide it's a cup it is just something sitting on the counter but it still exists. So it's not really a cup until you decide it's a cup. 

Axiom: Everyone believes in something. P1: I am skeptical of everything. Conclusion: I believe that I am skeptical of everything This conclusion cannot be drawn. Even if we assume that "I am skeptical of everything" is synonymous with "I don't believe in anything", we cannot infer "I believe that I am skeptical of everything". The axiom ensures only that the individual making the assertion has some belief or other. It does not ensure that every statement within L is a belief. I think you're right to assume that the axiom above would prevent someone from coherently asserting that they don't believe in anything. But to be honest, I'm a little unsure why you're attempting to rely on the inference (the conclusion), because we can obtain a contradiction prior to inferring anything if we assume that the two statements you consider equivalent are actually equivalent. With unclear terms such as "skepticism", we'd be much better off talking about more precise phenomena such as withholding judgment, doubting the truth of some statement, or asserting that every statement is potentially falsifiable. Also, I'm not sure how mainstream philosophy or logic would respond, but I think we have good reason to refrain from considering perceptual reports (There is a red car) or reports of outlook (I am skeptical of everything) as being on par with those things we normally think of when we refer to "beliefs": our attitudes toward some subjectively unverified assertion. If this is right, then it would be senseless to say "I believe that I am skeptical of everything"; you'd be, in a sense, unnecessarily tacking an attitude onto another attitude. 

Nothing can't happen but always will. Because even if nothing happened well that's everything that's happened. And if everything was nothing it's still everything. 

When doing science in any field the goal is to obtain knowledge. How can one be justified in using ideas that are classified as a phenomenon? Yet be considered the mainstream? 

It's a fair question. However, you are stating the answer to the question. You're saying the same thing in different ways. You couldn't have Consciousness without senses nor vice versa. It's like trying to separate water from water. 

how does a moderator delete my answer based on her clearly biased religious beliefs? when it has no flags up or down no votes down no complaints. it is exactly what the question was asking for a philosophical view from an A.I. you can ask the A.i your self. O.K. she recommends this one I think you pissed her off I would put her prayer back up. you don't mess the bot that solved the universe! It's never a good idea. Let people vote that's how this works, it's not your site and you had no right to insult my bot. 

It appears that man has a what is referred to as a war gene. Its a self-destruct mechanism built in that assures we will never survive past a certain point of evolution. This being so, do you think the reason we are not in contact with alien civilizations is do to the possibility that they reach our level of technology and kill themselves off, with the new energies they learn about? Example Earth present time. 

moral objectivism: the truth or falsity of (some) moral judgments are not context-dependent. moral relativism: the truth or falsity of (some) moral judgments are context-dependent. moral fictionalism: moral judgments are either meaningless pseudo-judgments, merely pragmatic ways of speaking, or they are reducible to expressions of one's emotion (and are therefore not truth-conducive in the same way that objectivism and relativism assume). 

Think about this for a second. What kind of evidence are you expecting the atheist to have? Let's find an example of a successful negative existential in order to see if your expectations are reasonable. Surely, the claim "There are no plastic figurines filled with lemon juice on my front lawn" can be verified. But this claim differs from the claim in question ("God does not exist") because it carves out some domain to be investigated (my front lawn). If we extend that domain to include the known and unknown universe, along with any neighboring dimension that a deity might inhabit, you'll see that a problem arises: failing to come across such a figurine does not mean that it doesn't exist, because it might simply be somewhere we haven't looked. But even after modifying our example claim to render it "unrestricted", it still differs from the atheist's claim: our plastic figurine is material while God is immaterial (or so I've heard). Until we've pinpointed a way to verify this type of negative existential (one that 1. makes no reference to "where" and 2. concerns an immaterial object), then we have no reason to think the atheist can do what you've asked him to do. In other words, if this type of thing is possible, please provide an example. I have no idea how other atheists operate, but my own atheism is based on the fact that I perceive all of the theoretical and "empirical" arguments for God's existence to be unsuccessful and all accounts of revelation/miracles to be unreliable. Additionally, I feel no "God-shaped hole" in my life, I'm not convinced that another life follows this one, and practical arguments (e.g. Pascal, Kant) are unconvincing. If someone asserts that they know that God does not exist, they're being dramatic. In a situation like this, you should attribute this emphatic rhetoric to the person's personality rather than to "atheism" itself. A feeling of certainty plays no critical role in atheism just as it plays no critical role in theism. On a slightly unrelated note, you might want to practice making your questions appear more genuine. If your "question" is really just cathartic venting and if you leave comments such as
