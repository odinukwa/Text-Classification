Pew-Pew sound would definitely not come from the laser beam itself - light doesn't make any discernible sound. I could see you making it an artifact of the power rapidly charging and discharging, though it's not necessary for the device to function. Typically solid state electronics are pretty silent. As mentioned in a comment, light moves way too fast for you to see. Assuming you could shove that much electrical power in a blaster-sized package (not possible with modern technology), you might have something slightly close. Some differences includes that there would be no recoil to the shot, and no explosive impact - it would burn the target, and not much else. Also, even the most powerful modern lasers take time to put a hole in a target - a sustained beam, not a gun-like shot in a single instant. 

Melt down small amounts and use it to manufacture gold plated "ultra fidelity lossless" audio/video/network/iphone charger cables that you sell at \$100 - $500 a piece to pretentious fools. This actually gets you more than the market price for your gold! You may not have 45 million dollars at once, but you'll have a steady income for many years, and as a bonus, you'll have 99 bars of gold left in case of apocalypse or something. Alternatively, restamp some of the bars with a Swastika, hide them in some cave in Germany and then "find them". If you get a 1% finder's fee, you're still rich. Edit: This answer has drawn a lot more attention than expected, so I will try to improve the quality some. The original question outlines the problem with authorities taking a dim view of anyone trying to sell a huge amount of gold from an unknown source. Unloading the gold in bulk to any shady people carries a serious risk too: They may well decide to betray you, lock you up and torture the location and source of your gold out of you. Assuming you don't already know how to speak "Billionaire", you would look out of place and suspicious trying to pass yourself off as one or even as a representative for a rich guy trying to liquidate some assets, though that is still a realistic option (see user16295's answer for a better description of that) but there are better options. Pawn shop road trip Luckily for you, you live in the age of StackExchange and more importantly, 3D printing with gold. It will take some setup and preparation, but you don't have to try and sell whole bars, you can instead mass-print jewelry and age it a bit (get some small bits of dirt stuck in the recesses). The second part of the prep is setting yourself up as some kind of travelling salesman or freelancer, plan some trips to distant states/cities and start doing rounds of the local pawn shops and gold buying outfits (don't google them from your own internet connection obviously). Never sell more than a "grandma's inheritance" at once. Accept cash only, but walk away from too low a price. You're not a thief trying to fence stolen goods after all. It will take a long time, but you can have fun along the way and get see more of the world. Hook up with someone important This is a lot more complicated, but you did become a hero in the course of your fantasy world adventure, so maybe your skills are up to it. The goal here is to make someone with the resources to buy your gold believe that you are well-connected, so that they will refrain from taking your gold and life for fear of the consequences. Your target will be some rich person that can unload the gold again, no questions asked. This means you'll probably end up with some Arab billionaire who's looking to gold-plate his newest yacht or wants to work with foreign businessmen on a prestige project. Getting into the oil and construction industries (as a contractor) will be difficult, but if you can manage it, they are your best options. Alternatively, you cash in some of your gold through the pawn shop route so you can spend enough to pose as an investor in any field currently popular over there. Your ticket to a deal will be an introduction by someone the target highly regards, so once you have some way in, network like crazy. The best stepping stone is likely a fellow countryman, both because it's easier to connect with them and because your real target will assume you know each other from business or private life "back home". Hang out in the expat favorite bars, find out who's only tech and who's a dealmaker. Get yourself invited to parties and events, etc. Once you have a promising link, investigate their business partners. Select the likeliest prospect and have a good story ready. "I need to sell $45 million in gold" is not a good story in most cases." Investment opportunities work best, so tell your newest BFF about your investment plan while you have some drinks and ask him if he knows about "this guy Aziz" and if they can introduce you. Make your pitch to the prospect and if he's interested, tell them that you would love to get into more detail and schedule a meeting some weeks ahead. Apologize profusely for the delay and explain you need the time to unwind another deal and free up your money. Pray for the guy to bite and ask about the details, at which point you mention the gold and see what happens. Note: All this assume you are a) male and b) of an age to pose as a business man. If you are female, all this will not work. If you also happen to be a hot blonde, then you can skip all the socializing and just straight up ask the first crazy-colored supercar driving guy you spot to buy all your gold. 

It's possible, as other answers indicate, to convert kinetic force into electricity, so I won't repeat that. But what you should think about is the cost-benefit ratio. The truth is, it's not feasible to add the complexity of an extra subsystem to an already ridiculously complex system. Think of the amount of electricity it takes to accelerate anything to several times the speed of sound. Power savings from a kinetic converter would simply be insignificant. 

A much shorter answer that the rest, but a good point I think: Theocracy is a form of government with a god as its ruler. Logically, a world where gods are powerful and apparent would lead to there being few atheists, but that doesn't mean gods must rule (every) society. On the contrary, if the gods desire worship, I think those worshiping sincerely and not under compulsion of law would be more pleasing to (at least some of) them. Some more egotistical gods may, of course, establish a nation for themselves, but only because it gives them glory among mortals. They already have power, which is what rulers and tyrants typically seek when establishing kingdoms. 

Scale down or cease all open hostilities to promote complacency. Recruit a famous architect sympathetic to your course. Have it come to the king's attention that someone else (abroad) is planning to have a great monumental palace built. Wait for his desire to grow, then have the architect approach the king with a grandiose design for a giant hall. Entice the king to order the construction and build the hall at mostly his expense, include cleverly hidden stress points. This will take some years. Infiltrate dedicated rebels among the servants as sleepers. When the time for the grand opening nears, subtly spread rumors about how various kin are planning great tributes to gain the king's favor. Encourage everyone's ambitions to ensure as many of the immortals as possible attend the opening ceremony. Shortly before the opening contact and instruct the sleepers on how to find and collapse their assigned stress points. Send volunteers dressed as priests to the ceremony. Let them loudly proclaim the Gods' wrath. Do this where the soldiers, guards and public can hear. Give the signal and collapse the hall, imprisoning most of the immortals under tons of stone. Have your gathered mob take up the slogan that the Gods want all immortals buried in stone. Overwhelm the remainder with nets and bury them under as much stone as you can. Hopefully, the mortal soldiers will be so shocked and demoralized that you can avoid a civil war, otherwise things will still get bloody. For bonus points, fill up the ruins with earth and build a monument to the folly of the immortals on top of it. 

If they are intelligent enough to have language faculties, then as the other answers say, they are simply undead humans. As dangerous as humans, and possibly more so if they aren't restricted by the weaknesses of human biological systems. But the question becomes, at that point, what issues do your room-temperature humans have with higher-than-room-temperature humans? If zombies are intelligent enough to think freely, what unites them against normal humans? Why wouldn't their allegiances to their country, family (undead or still living), or religion trump anything else, especially if they were once a normal human? Sure, you might have a terrorist zombie here or there, but what reason do intelligent creatures (on the whole) have to want to see the world of normal humans fall? 

This will fail quickly as there are only a handful of big producers across the world, who all use roughly the same process and get their ore at a number of known suppliers. They know exactly how much ore you should be buying, how much electricity, etc. When they contact your suppliers to find out how much better of a deal you made, they find out you're not buying that much ore, or electricity. They will suspect you're actually selling ill-gotten Aluminium, either stolen or from a country under embargo. This ensures a government investigation and that's it. Game over. Turning that situation around, here are the things to aim for when selecting an industry: 

It really depends on the type of telepathy you as the author/creator envision. There could be telepathy that is purely intentional, akin to speaking or sign language. If others can always sense your thoughts or emotions, that might more properly be called mind reading or emotional empathy. In the latter, people still might be able to put up walls around their mind to pad or mute the effect. So ultimately, you get to choose. Additional considerations: First, on a communication level, what is truth? What separates truth from a lie? Whether I say the sky is blue or orange, there is nothing inherent in my communication that determines one or the other as real - truth is determined by the facts of life, regardless of what is communicated. The only exception with telepathy or mind reading would be sensing the intention to deceive, and intention is not the same thing as emotion. You mentioned "evolved" telepathy, so consider what else might have evolved along with that - a subset of related functions that facilitate communication, including "blocking" thoughts or projecting only what is desired. Some might be better at communicating visual imagery, like artists, while musicians would have a much more detailed concept of audio information. Some might not be good at this - you probably know people in real life who are terrible liars with just words. And anyone can run and jump, but watch the Olympics and tell me you can swim life Phelps. People can train and hone their natural skills to do amazing things, and as a natural ability, I can't imagine this would be an exception. Edit In response to OP's comment defining his or her brand of telepathy: Others have answered about "lying" to oneself, so I won't repeat those. "Feelings" then, must be very precisely defined. Particularly, distinguish between: 

Any celestial body over a radius of a few hundred kilometers will collapse into a sphere. Even solid stone cannot hold against gravity and it will break apart or "flow" as the atoms themselves are forced apart. It is safe to assume that your planet (having an atmosphere and all the usual goodness that makes it suitable for life) has a radius at least 10 times that. If you suddenly take away half the mass of the planet, it will still be way over the limit, so it is going to shift until it is once again a sphere. This is likely to be more violent and spectacular than even Roland Emmerich can imagine. Not only will the molten core be exposed and mixing with the outer crust, the friction from all of that shifting mass is likely to heat the crust itself to high enough to set things on fire everywhere or even to start melting itself. It's unlikely there will be any inhabitants alive after the planet settles into its smaller self, and if there are any that survived the cataclysm, they can then gasp for air (in a much thinner atmosphere) while they enjoy a good view of the shrinking sun as the planet zooms off into a new orbit much farther out, or even escapes into deep space. 

You are talking about a literal unicorn. Some creative license is allowed. Electrocuting itself isn't a problem for the same reason it isn't a problem in real-world electricity-generating animals: their bodies are adapted to it as a natural function. If you really must include some vague science, say that there are at least two separate organs, or parts to the single organ, that generates the electricity: a low-voltage power supply and a transformer. Stun guns ramp up quite low voltages (household batteries, maybe 20 volts at most) to tens of thousands of volts to make their sparks. The unicorn has a structure that, in addition to simply generating a current, transforms that current into a higher voltage, accumulates a charge over short amounts of time and releases it in bursts. (Note that most of what we see as sparks, lightning included, are bursts of accumulated charges and not continuous streams). Hope this helps!
