I don't think there is a magic number, but successive short-term jobs raises a red flag unless she has done temp work and/or consulting. What could you put on a resume that you accomplished in a few months? Anyone who "job hops" is going to struggle with basic interview questions: 

You may want to look at skills on a broader level to find some overlap. Problem solving of any type should relate well to programming. You may want to indicate the complexity of the problem. Communication in all forms is important in programming. Not all programmers have a positive track-record of working face to face with clients. There are some programming positions where this is a must. Examples of proposals or any other documentation will help as well. I know you want to show some quantification, but don't put too much in non-related areas. Most people in the other fields will not be able to recognize the significance of too many items. You really need to be able to convince people why you want to change fields and that you're capable. Think of a way to indicate you were a programmer doing an environmental consulting job and not an environmental consultant who wants to be a programmer. 

It's harder to differentiate sr. devs. I know you think it should be easier to identify your skills, but that's only comparing you to lesser devs. Risk They say a good developer is 8-10 more productive. Regardless of the desirability of the firm, they have to get this right. Not only is the expected increase in productivity at risk, but you'd be expected to mentor entry-level programmers. If you don't work out, the problems are compounded. Personal Fit I agree that doing coding exercises or solving puzzles for 4 hours would be too much. There's more to the interview than just technical abilityh (I hope.). I know this sounds bad, but a lengthy interview is sort of an interagation technique. Most people can fake their personality for about a half hour. They're going to ask you the same thing over again. After 4 hours, they get to see the real you. Other Industries and Experiences Academia is notorious for interviews lasting an entire weekend. Even in the tech industry, I've had several interviews for the same job and the final one was a formal lunch. I took a teaching/coaching position that required 5 interviews; the last one was in front of the entire school board. It's a double-edge sword. You may not want them to take up your time, but you should want to work for someone who is willing to give up theirs as well (Locking you in a room for 4 hours doing a paper and pencil test is not what I envision.). I don't know the magic number of hours, but if you're not willing to go a minimum of 2 and probably closer to 4, I don't think you're right for the job and would be better off applying to places you think merit your time. Edit: I do appreciate your follow-up comments to your question. You're willing to go through the process, but still feel a company should consider the attractiveness of the job they are offering relative to yours. This Uncle Bob post made me think of this question. 

There is a difference and if there isn't a mechanism to separate the sites that are more personal in nature, you should use a separate account. Using social sites for background checks on employees is becoming more prevalent, so everyone should be concerned with their online presence. I would be more inclined to only link to professional contacts on LinkedIn and personal contacts on Facebook. Neither of these are going on my resume. If they do a background check/search, I'm comfortable with the information they would access. The SO Career site is used more like a CV and you would encourage a potential employer to view this information; otherwise, what's the point. You have to be careful of everything you put on it. Even spelling may count more. 

Don't do a PowerPoint presentation if you're just going to show some bullet points that match what you're saying. If you need to represent data, charts, images, video, etc., that would be different. I think this applies even more if this is going to be one on one. Also, don't do a presentation if you don't have a projector. I don't know what you mean by"famous" but they don't have a lot of time and will become bored quickly. And if they're not a business person (actor, politician, athlete, etc.), this will be worse. Focus on demonstrating your app and listening to feedback. They'll want to talk. You're going to get interupted. Don't let it upset you. Stay calm. Even though you're a student, let them know you can solve problems and work hard. Be natural and confident. Important: Practice your demonstration to anyone you can find. Family or friends and all different technical levels. Edit: If you're just going to read your slides, don't do a presentation. 

When you have multiple interviews, often the interviewers are pulled from different parts of the company, so you should have questions for them. It doesn't matter if you ask the same question, it could help get a different perspective. HR - ask questions about the hiring process and benefits packages. Senior Exec - You may not always get a person high up in the company, but when you do ask about the future direction and any large plans. Direct Supervisor - Ask how the team is made up and how it is managed and expectations. Team members/coworkers - take the opportunity to get their interpretation of how the team is run and the future plans of the company. If these responses are out of synch with management that could be a problem. It is difficult to predict who is going to make the hiring decision. Maybe everyone has an equal vote or the direct supervisor picks, but everyone else could veto a pick if they have serious concerns. Since you don't know, make the best out of all the interviews. Look like you care by asking questions and get the information you need to make the best decision possible. 

Don't hesitate to negotiate this. Many people don't want to work from home, so they never bother to ask. They may not be offering the salary you want or the number of vacation days. I've been with a few companies where I was the only person who did this. You'll probably be required to work from the office for a period of time before they'll consider this. Try to get a specific timeframe to have this discussion and then ease into it. Also, not all companies have the technology to make this work (VPN, SAAS apps, etc.). Your manager, clients or people from other departments may want face to face meetings, so the company/hr department policy may not be able to over-ride this. 

Make sure everyone understands what is expected of them, how they will be evaluated, and the consequences. Development teams, often do work that affects everyone else, so they should know who isn't getting the job done already. There shouldn't be any surprises. Work out a strategy to prevent the hiring of people who are so poorly qualified to do the job. The interview process is flawed. Not all hires workout, but if you figured this one out in probably less than a month, someone made a huge mistake. 

It's important to be able to negotiate in these situations. Is there another employee at a similar level who could cover for each other on different holidays? Both may need to plead the case to the employer that one can handle it. A second step may be to ask for part of the day off or a shift in hours. This would prevent a lot of traveling, but at lease she could be there at a crucial time of a holiday. At least in the US, the retail industry is notorious for hiring temporary employees to cover the additional hours since many make up to 85% of their sales during this time of year. Similar to trying to get the night off in the restaurant industry. 

Jay is allowing "perfect" to be the enemy of good. Sometimes a carpenter needs to repeat the same series of cuts on a board, so they make a small jig. They don't create a massive programmable machine capable of automating everything. If the time to create the tool makes up for itself in time, then you do it. Jay needs to think of maybe a single task that could be made easier with a new tool that doesn't take up too much time. Just a few of these could add up to a great savings to the company and offer a competitive edge. This is the type of thing business wants. You have to learn how to play the game to keep from going out of your mind. Very few jobs allow the time to work on new things or have any kind of R&D component. If Jay feels so strong about his grand idea, maybe he should develop it on his own time and put his money where his mouth is. 

This really depends on their reaction if on occasion you ask to change the subject. Maybe the start of lunch is all about the card game, but at some point, you should be able to ask about another topic that interests you. Give it a shot and see what happens. You never know, there may be someone who is into the things that interest you. Any extensive conversation on the subject may have to be saved for another time or may not be a major part of the meeting with everyone else, but you get some change of pace. Even if I like this game, I would want to talk about something else eventually. You'll be doing the team a favor by getting them to include other topics of conversation. I hope they give other people and subjects a chance to enter their lives. It's rude of them not to ask about you and try to find out what interests you. 

I don't know if we can answer this. There may be a tendency for the larger companies in your area to favor recent graduates, those that interned with them and possibly only consider candidates that came from a certain level of university. This has nothing to do with experience at a small company. Often smaller companies can offer a wider variety of experiences and possibly get involved with projects at a higher level because they don't have the resources to divide up the work in many smaller pieces like their larger competitors. This could be an opportunity to exceed the current experience of those that went to work for a larger company for the same period of time. They're still siting on the sidelines. Another problem you may be facing is the industry's perception of the quality of your current company. You may want to see if there is anyone who has worked there for a few years and moved on to bigger companies that have more opportunities for growth. Unfortunately, you may be stigmatized due to no fault of your own. Maybe there is someone back at your university you can talk to about this? They may be encouraging graduates to go directly to the bigger companies for reasons we can't know because we're not in your particular location and job market.
