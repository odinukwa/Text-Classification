So: supply and demand has made something economical to make in space. But there's a catch: space is very expensive to go to. It has a lot of special properties but it is fundamentally an expensive place to visit, so whatever you make in space has to be incredibly valuable(and not just decoratively. It has to be used for something and there can't be good alternatives). (It occurs to me that human nature is kind of awful and therefore there will be people who sell space tomatoes for exorbitant prices specifically because they're exorbitantly expensive and rich people will buy them to impress one another, but that's boring.) There's one thing space (well, orbit) has that Earth doesn't have. Well, the other way around. It's gravity. Space has microgravity environments for minutes or hours at a time, and there's no way to do that for more than a few seconds on the ground. Hard vacuums, radiation, energy, isolation are all doable(if expensive) on the ground. And what can you do without gravity? Grow crystals, incredibly perfect ones. Isolating your crystal pods from vibrations and convective forces as the crystal forms lets crystals form with much fewer deviations or defects. The crystal growing chamber has a seed crystal and some solution, and all it needs is to cool down very slowly. That's really easy to build with zero moving parts and no maintenance required, so living spaces for human beings(expensive and breakable) is minimized and productive crystal aging vats are maximized. Superconductors are strange metal crystals that benefit from extreme regularity, perhaps space is the only place they can grow stable enough to work at room temperature. Maybe they're just growing giant germanium-doped silicon crystals for really sensitive radio receivers. Or giant perfectly regular crystals to build gravity interferometers for detecting cloaked spaceships by their gravity signature. Giant protein crystals for X-ray diffraction. Or giant rock candy, or all of the above. 

It depends on what kind of soil you mean. Sand is basically just glass, and glass comes in blue. So blue sand is easy, and as some soils are mostly sand, those soils would be blue. Calcite and dolomite based clay soils are white or really pale. If contaminated with cobalt salts or iron cyanide salts it does turn up blue, sometimes. Prussian blue is insoluble and forms a very fine colloid when left alone, so it tends to linger in the soil. It is 'relatively nontoxic'. If you wanted to grow a plant in blue soil, I would start with a calcite clay, add cobalt-doped sand and very finely powdered organic material. The organic material is black, which would darken your light blue clay/sand mixture. At this point it's a trade-off between how toxic you can have your blue dirt be and how blue you want it to be. Generally, you can add as much blue sand as you want, but you'll only be able to grow cacti and palm trees. If you want something more like regular dirt you'll need to add clay and Prussian blue, which will degrade from microbial activity(very slowly, but still). Soil contaminated by Prussian blue as a side effect of coal gasification was once sold as a herbicide, so be stingy with it. As organic matter turns over into the soil it'll darken as more carbon gets incorporated. Make sure to turn the soil regularly, or the clay and sand will settle out into different layers. All of this does kind of count as 'staining', though. Unfortunately, dirt is made of silica and organic matter, and neither of those can be blue without additives or something really exotic going on. Blue is often a 'structural color' in nature, but that kind of color requires a reasonably ordered crystal to work, which is not really how dirt works. 

The other answers pretty efficiently cover what you can do with stinging jellyfish. If I may summarize: When dead: put on your enemies with whips/bombs/tshirt guns/long sticks. When alive: sic on your enemies, possibly fill with bang juice. Now: let's consider nonstinging jellyfish for a moment. BUT WAIT you cry, what is the point of a stingless goop in warfare? Let me tell you about Pykrete. It's ice cut with fibers, which improves shatter resistance and raw strength, as well as melt resistance. Do you see where I'm going here? Gelatinous frozen-jelly-armor can be feet thick, shatterproof, and absorb thermal attacks. Because it's water-based, HEAT rounds will cause tiny steam explosions, neutralizing the shaped charge. Tanks coated with frozen jellyfish would have a jelly layer on the very outside roughly .5 jelly thick, anchored in a layer of ice. Deep inside the ice layer, put a condenser and cooling equipment to keep the ice cold over very long periods(for battle you can turn it off) and you can even repair your tank in the field with more jellyfish! Slop them on the craters in your armor, put a tarp over the thing, come back in the morning for fresh new impenetrable armor. (you said anywhere in the question. So. Anywhere.) In order to enhance thickness I would recommend putting iron rods through the armor like long spikes, to conduct heat down into the cooling zone and increase the thickness without having to get too overboard with chillers. Ice is a great insulator. They're also probably useful as a glue when rendered down in a big vat, but not better than like, horse hooves. 

The Pacific Ocean is unfathomably big. There's lots of space in it to hide an island. Somewhere between New Zealand and Argentina is appropriate. The ocean is flat, but even from standing on top of a hundred foot destroyer, the horizon is only 12 miles away. So you don't actually have to keep boats very far away to hide effectively. Note that this also works for ship-based radar. This leaves satellites and planes. If this is a natural island and not a floating habitat you're going to be picked up on radar/gravity deflection images of the planet as a big lump on the ocean floor, because islands are just mountain peaks, and mountains are big. So you have to pretend to be a seamount or a small atoll or something. I recommend seamount, remote atolls attract biologists. So if you're a seamount, you need to paint ocean colors on the tops of things so you look pretty much like an ocean from space. This isn't going to work forever, so I recommend you invest in an artificial cloud generator. A big plume of steam will work in a pinch, but I recommend heating a big patch of ocean miles upwind of you, then seeding cloud formation over the island. You won't need to do it all the time, just whenever a satellite with a good camera is looking, and you should have plenty of advance warning of that kind of thing. So that just leaves planes and really persistent boats. A combination of electronic counter-measures, radar-spoofing transmitters, fake GPS signals, and just plane (heh) fake clouds should keep most planes and boats reliably off-course. Worst case scenario, torpedo the boat/missile the plane, recover/fake the transponder and/or black box, and put it on a different plane that crashes somewhere else to divert attention. Or don't. Boats disappear all the time. The really easy way to do this is just put the whole civilization on a big floating habitat so it can move around and actively dodge boats and planes. Then you can get away with only steam plume for satellites because nobody will notice that one spot in the ocean is constantly covered in clouds. 

You have absurd electromagnets on your ship. They are powered. They produce (somehow) a large magnetic field gradient outside your ship. Lenz's Law means every conductive thing passing through this absurd field will pick up a magnetic eddy current and slow down. Very resistive things will not generate large currents/fields and therefore not slow down as much as conductive things. Conductive things will dissipate much more power and therefore are more likely to melt or catch on fire. In terms of whether any particular bullet can be stopped/melted/vaporized depends on what that bullet is made of(and its shape). I could imagine glass bullets or what have you might, if traveling very fast indeed, exceed the dielectric breakdown voltages and become much more conductive. So: given a large enough magnetic field, you can melt or break down most things. Does this help you at all? Maybe not. A glass bullet that is traveling fast enough to induce an eddy current that ionizes it into a conductive plasma is not made much less deadly by turning it from a bit of glass to a rapidly expanding cloud of conductive plasma(which will interact with the field in complicated ways I don't really know much about. Possibly the field will 'bottle' the plasma. Possibly it won't. Possibly it will accelerate it into the magnets like a tiny aurora borealis.). Small conductive objects might be thrown at the shielding simply to vent as much power as possible from the fields through the object, turning them into tiny EMP devices that also explode conventionally. (At first there was a bit here about how your flagship would heat the water it floated on, and possibly simply sink to the bottom of the sea in a cloud of superheated steam. I realized you probably didn't mean ocean flagship, but it's a fun mental image anyway.) 

Unless the animals are magically guided to specifically attack human beings, no way. Specifically, humans already did this once, about 12 thousand years ago. The giant ground sloths, giant rodents, regular lions and tigers on the American continent were systematically wiped out for practical or culinary reasons in the centuries following human arrival. Humans needed flint, sticks, fire, and language. They still have all these things in the year 0, but now they also have armies, written language, boats, and metals. If you would like a specific example: The polar bear hunters of Zhokov island. 397 polar bear skulls, hunted with bone and stone tools. 

Filariasis Fever is a pretty effective treatment for a lot of things, so much so that malaria has been used to treat leprosy and end-stage syphilis. However, leprosy doesn't respond nearly as well to fever as filariasis does, according to this doctor again. Protracted fever in malaria patients causes a near-complete extinction of the parasites. So perhaps the Earth Nation has a strong tradition of bathing in hot springs? Or volcanic mud baths, which is definitely a thing people do worldwide wherever there are hot mud pools. Thematically that makes sense, submerging yourself in the literal earth makes sense as a custom for an Earth Nation. The Fire nation can take up building sweat lodges or something. 

Some givens, because "everyone dies" is boring: The moons stay in orbit, and don't hit each other. First, the "mundane stuff": Tides: Goes without saying, insane. Not catastrophic, just really unpredictable. Influence on sea life? Probably not that much. Volcanism and tectonic activity: High. Volcanoes, lots of earthquakes(not big ones, mind, but lots and lots, probably each time you gain and lose a moon.) Calendar: Almost worthless over long periods. The length of the day will change as new moons are added and subtracted. How much by? Depends on the size of the moon and its orbital distance. Not a lot a lot but perhaps a day or two over a few decades. Tidal stresses from switching gravity on the moons themselves would probably make them erupt in their own volcanoes.(They'd almost certainly have liquid cores because tides) Rains of sulfuric acid, big rocks, lumps of ice, nearly anything is possible with just mundane moons made of regular moon stuffs. Now, the exotics. I don't know much about what planes these moons visit, but coming back from the elemental plane of fire and orbiting close to the planet might have an interesting effect on local weather. Not setting-fires hot, but you know. Problematic ecologically. Also there would be nearly no night due to the giant scary red glow in the sky. A Europa-like moon might freeze and remelt every time it came to visit. The less often a moon visited, the more likely it would be to have a catastrophically huge eruption and shower ejecta onto the world below. In general it's not if you receive orbital gifts but when and how often you get presents from your moon visitors. Most things would be killed on impact but you might get the occasionally durable houseguest, if there's life on the moons some of the time. 

It's not precisely about gravity as much as it is about height. The largest natural creatures are likely as big as natural creatures with traditional body plans can be, but the constraints on an engineered kaiju are extraordinarily relaxed. At all times a titanosaur must be mobile and competitive with other organisms, but a kaiju can be grown with arbitrary amounts of scaffolding etc etc. The 25 year time limit is plenty of time, considering that biomass scales exponentially. A 'kaiju' consisting of just bacteria fed as much food they want in the right amounts for 25 years has extremely large mass. (An E. coli has about a one hour doubling time on minimal media, and there are 219000 hours in 25 years. This means after 25 years there'll be about 4*10^65000 bacteria, which each weigh about a picogram. The high-end estimates for the mass of the observable universe are 4*10^70 picograms. 25 years for a gestation time is plenty.) Consider exotic 'kaiju' which are just 500 tons of ants all joined together with little living whiskers in a giant creepy carpet. It's clear this superorganism can become nearly arbitrarily large. See Pando, who is heavier than Godzilla (much heavier) but shorter and spread out. Oxygen supply isn't a concern if you let yourself have multiple pairs of lungs or passive convective ventilation like a skyscraper(or you're a tree). Weight is not a concern if you let yourself spread out horizontally. Respiration is not a concern if you let yourself be porous. The highest strength materials(by weight) are Kevlar or Dyneema or what have you. Admittedly these are tensile not compressive strengths, but if you have a tube that's full of water and about 50% water by weight you can convert one into the other using hydrostatic compression at a 50% strength penalty(blah blah laplace's law blah blah optimal radius blah. We're exceptional engineers, we'll figure it out). Anyway. Concrete is one of the weakest construction materials by specific strength, and cannot get more than 400 meters high under its own weight. A concrete post 500 meters high will crumble even if it is prevented from snapping or buckling. Even if we stick to traditional organic materials (spider silk) we can build a post 100km tall if it's prevented from snapping or buckling. Beings built from concrete can really never be more than 400 meters high unless you build pyramids. So we want to build a giant creature that can break things. That means we want arms or legs or something, so we have to stay well below our maximum height so we can have non-load bearing space for brains and lungs and eyes. Additionally a big club might take much much more strain while being swung than the club would experience under gravity. We can estimate the maximum permissible height for realistic walking-around loads using titanosaurs. Titanosaurs were about 50m high, and used bone and flesh. Bone's self-supporting length is about 20km plus minus, so walking and being a real creature means the skeleton has to support about 400 times gravity stresses. Dyneema can support itself up to almost 400km, so using this extremely dirty heuristic a Dyneema-skeletoned creature could be almost 1km high and still stand up and theoretically walk around. If it was dinosaur-shaped it would have Other Problems(like breathing, and the poor maximum strength geometry of muscles) but the principle is "sound". Building a giant starfish about 30 stories tall and starfish-shaped would definitely be able to destroy buildings but I'm not sure about the speed requirements. Anyway. An organism on this scale is immune to conventional small arms fire essentially trivially, as you can just write off the outside meter of flesh as expendable and then you have 100 cm of ablative armor. Technically a lot of automatic weapons could act like a sandblaster(eventually) but I don't know who has that kind of time/ammunition. Anti-tank rounds are actually easier to defeat than conventional weapons, because they are so specialized for thick layers of metal. Very thick layers of flesh(from the point of view of a tank-sized object) dissipate the energy well before it can reach anything important, and conventional high explosives can be slowly dissipated by a composite ceramic/kevlar (or shell/cartilage, depending how you look at it) layer. tl;dr Being tall is hard, being big is easier than being tall, the hardest part about this is going fast while being big or tall.
