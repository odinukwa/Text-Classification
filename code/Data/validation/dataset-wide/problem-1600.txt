Notice how many of these the hard-working students are NOT doing? High stress is associated with mental illness. Here and here are two studies specifically about students (there are many more making the connection regardless of occupation), though the first of them mentions that Norwegian med school students overall don't have more mental health issues than the general population. In conclusion: Not relaxing can lead to stress-related issues, but you don't need to specifically study quantum electrodynamics to become depressed - studying hard and worrying about passing that exam (and possibly being a foreign student in a strange culture, see here) suffices. 

Assuming that the authors can summarize prior research, I didn't hunt down the Forbes reference; here's the info for those who want to look at the original source: Forbes, T. W., K. Moscowitz, and G. Morgan. A Comparison of Lower Case and Capital Letters for Highway Signs. Proc., 30th Annual Meeting of the Highway Research Board, Washington, D.C., 1950. After testing their new font, "Clearview" (which is, to me, indeed easy to read), Garvey et al. find again that 

Short answer: In the short to mid term, poor and middle class in the outsourcing country do poorly. Ultimately, there may be a sufficient gain for the overall economy that everybody wins, but if demand for low-skilled labor is limited, it may take a long time till "ultimately". 

Both chickenpox and the chickenpox vaccine can lead to shingles, a neurological disease that occurs when dormant virus re-emerges as immunity fades. To reduce the risk of shingles, immune people need to be re-exposed to the virus or be re-vaccinated in their 50s. Re-exposure used to happen automatically before vaccination, however, since vaccination has lead to a ~80% decrease in the number of varicella cases, natural re-exposure has become more difficult (see medscape reference below). Thus, there has been an increase in the incidence of shingles. Pox parties can be one way of getting re-exposed to varicella. 

On an individual level, the question is, unfortunately, very difficult to answer. You would need to have access to the employment history of a large number of people in order to make any significant statement. Such data simply do not exist. One recent study (Autor, Dorn, Hanson: "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States" (pdf); see also the article about it in WSJ) has looked at the effect of imports from China on local US labor markets: What happens to a local labor market when the country is importing lots of products that were traditionally produced by the local labor market (commuting zone, CZ)? 

EDIT: That's actually two false claims! Claim 1: For every trait we can find in nature, one could find a way to explain why it's adaptive This claim is false for two reasons (1) Not every trait is adaptive, and (2) At the moment, it is not technically possible to test many of the explanations. Not every trait is adaptive: Evolution, as in the change in the genetic make-up of a population, is more than "survival of the fittest". The genetic make-up of a population changes due to mutations, genetic drift, recombination, and selection. Only the latter is adaptive. The three former are non-adaptive, but can still give rise to traits that we can observe now. See for example this article for a discussion of why it can be wrong to always look for an adaptive explanation for specific traits. Today, we simply can't know: With the exception of genetically engineered organisms, genomes, and the traits derived from them that we observe today are the product of evolution. However, in many cases, we cannot know the evolutionary mechanism that gave rise to the trait, especially in humans: Was it adaptive, i.e. the trait was so beneficial to the population and/or its individuals that they were able to produce more offspring? Or did the trait get fixed in the population by chance? (note that in e.g. bacteria, with their enormous populations, we can quite safely assume that every trait we observe is selected for). There are two problems often faced when trying to answer this question. (1) You need a large amount of genetic information on many individuals in order to statistically determine how the trait has been propagated, and (2) in many cases (sickle cell anemia is a notable exception), we are not able to really quantify the fitness advantage of a trait, and/or we simply don't know where on the genome it is encoded. Claim 2: evolutionary explanations are nothing more than "just so stories" This claim is false in its general scope. Yes, as mentioned above, not every trait is adaptive, and not every trait is well enough understood so that we can make a claim. Thus, some "explanations" (which should usually be labeled speculation) may be "just so stories", though many of those are simply hypotheses that are not testable yet, at least not on the level of the genome. That is likely to change as sequencing technology improves, and the $1000 genome becomes available (see here for a bit of speculation what this will do for research). However, there are plenty of examples of evolutionary explanations involving adaptive changes, even in humans, such as sickle cell anemia, lactose persistence, or the adaptation to low oxygen at high altitude. EDIT 2: Not all "explanations" are equal. There is speculation, hypothesis, and what I would call founded explanation. In the OP and my above post, "explanation" is normally understood as hypothesis or founded explanation, rather than speculation. "Speculation" is what you can just make up by purely using your superior intellect, but without needing to consult actual data. Within the realm of evolution, speculation is often resulting in just-so stories, since many people tend to not understand how evolution works. "Hypotheses" are what you propose when you actually consider the data; they are ideally haven't-gotten-around-to-do-the-experiment, rather than not-yet-testable, and should not be sorry-can't-test-this-ever. Founded explanation is once you successfully confirmed a hypothesis. This may still turn out to be wrong, since reality, and biology in particular, tends to be more complex than what we think, but it's at least consistent with what we know right now.
