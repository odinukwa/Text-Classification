This answer assumes you are being unpaid during your internship, you imply this in your question but are not explicit about it. Company A is exploiting you. There is a culture that seems to have grown that people can be asked to work for nothing to gain skills and the possibility of future work. You are providing value to the company and not being compensated. I have no idea how or even if this is legal but it is exploitation all the same. So given this, I would suggest you forget about how well known company A is. They do not sound like a reputable employer. They are using their 'fame' as a means to exploit workers. Company B have shown they value you and your skill set and are not seeking to exploit you. They seem deserving of your time and efforts. 

Yea, the 'international and local wages and my relative position' sounds like a line they feed you to try and justify. I would believe it. It is possible that the company is struggling and can't afford to pay more. If their costs are being squeezed they may not have scope to pay more. A company would not want to tell their employees this directly so they may use the 'international average' as a way to fob you off. It is also possible they are being tight. They are trying to get away with paying you as little as possible. The can then go into profits or even bonuses for the line managers. If you are unable to leave and they will not negotiate the only other thing you can do is ask for a promotion. If you have several years of glowing reports this would seem possible. Perhaps it is time to take on more responsibility and get more wage for doing so. You don't specifically exclude this as an option so it is worth mentioning. 

If you are lucky enough to not to have to worry financially and you are fairly confident that you can freelance if need be, I think taking some time off for a break is a great idea. Why? 1. R&R Job searches can be hard work, especially if you have a demanding job. Taking some time to yourself can be great for you, it can give you some time to decompress and evaluate what you want to do next. 2. Travel Related to R&R but there are some trips that can't be easily done while working where you get a limited amount of holiday time. Long trips and experiencing other cultures can also be great for you personally, giving you a fresh perspective on your life. 3. Training There may be some skills that you would like to learn or brush up on, this can be hard when you are working full time. You can spend time on a formal or informal course to give you a chance to learn things that will be advantageous when looking for a new job. 4. Community work This could be open source work, or something local where your experience can be useful. Again this is a good thing to talk about when interviewing and can be good to give you insight into yourself. 5. Flexibility You kind of mentioned this, but it is worth reiterating when you start to look for work you can be flexible about when and where you interview and you can also be more flexible about start dates and locations, which will not hurt your prospects. 6. Networking You don't specify your field, but you may find there are events you can go to, conferences or such like, where you can network, talk about jobs and get to know more people in your field. If your current employers won't give you time for this you will be able to go on your own time (and cost). This can be a great springboard to freelancing or to another permanent position. 7. Assertiveness When you are interviewing you will be able to use points 2-6 above to show that you are a confident go-getting individual who is not afraid to step out of the norm to improve themselves. This is in many cases seen as a good thing and can reflect well on your prospects. So, of course, there are risks involved in jumping ship without a plan, and these should be seriously considered. But it is far from all downside, used correctly it can also benefit you greatly. 

I'd attend the second interview, even if you'd accepted the position at Company A- but is it likely they're going to offer it to you that quickly? It's a judgement call on whether or not to accept the position immediately - are they likely to change their minds if you ask for a couple of days to think it over? That kind of depends on how much they seem to want you; in my experience, it's very unusual for a company to offer you a job and then turn you down because you ask for a few days to make a decision. Regardless of whether or not you take the position, Company B made the decision to interview you; they've allocated time to talk to you and they've likely already paid for everything necessary; you don't owe them anything and there's not going to be hard feelings if it turns out you don't take the job (if it's even offered to you). Getting interview experience is always a good thing, in my opinion, and you never know: it might turn out that Company B are willing to make you an excellent offer that you hadn't previously considered. At the very least, you'll meet a few people that you have a chance to impress that may well remember you in the future, wherever you both end up. 

I have never gone wrong saying "let me buy you a beer after work". It's almost always appreciated (if they say they don't drink, obviously look have a think for another small token of your appreciation - lunch is a good alternative) and it's a good way to make new friends and get to know your colleagues a bit better! 

In my mind, it really depends on how much you value money. Personally, being in secure employment in a place that I truly enjoy working is more valuable than a modest salary increase. You likely spend almost half of your waking adult life going to work and so if a job makes you happy then you cannot put a price tag on that. As an anecdote, a couple of years ago I took a very large pay cut moving to a new job simply because I was miserable in my higher-paid job. I worked hard and over those two years I became a key member of the team and was rewarded accordingly. Even if I hadn't had a pay rise, I'd still be infinitely happier than I was before; I no longer wake up in the morning and think "oh hell, I have to go to work today", which is an incredibly valuable thing to me. However, if it's a substantial increase in pay or if you really need the extra to make ends meet, then there's plenty to suggest you consider the new offer. But in this situation there's nothing to stop you, should you be offered the job, to speak to your current employer and let them know that you love your current position but cannot afford to turn down the higher salary. Worst case scenario they'll be sorry to see you go and wish you well; best case they might increase your pay and/or benefits if they are keen to keep you on board. Either way, you've shown that you appreciate the environment you're currently in. I'd say you should check out the details of the new position, go for an interview and do a little research on how they operate to help you decide if it's somewhere you'd be as happy or happier than you are now (and whether or not the pay increase will add to that happiness!). It never hurts to get more interview experience and, should they offer you the job and you decline, you've made a new contact that may keep you in mind wherever they end up in their future career. 

It sounds like you are in a horrible situation, and you should never have to do such things. You sound like you are quite deliberately non-managerial. if you don't have a chance to move this may make it a bit easier for you. It is also worth you trying to find someone higher up the chain to talk to, even if you have never seen them in person. Your manager's behavior is not just hurting you and the team you are in but the company itself. If products don't get shipped profits drop and shareholders get unhappy. Thinking about it in a general rather than a personal nature may help you to make the step, you are not just helping yourself but the whole company. 

People have answered about why the accepted wisdom is good, and they are valid points but you also asked 

Work out your market rate (I think Stack Overflow as a tool for this) Work out your monthly (or annual deficit), your market rate - your salary Book a meeting with your Father and the Co-owner to discuss this. You'll have to be firm but friendly. Frame it as 'by working for the family company I am effectively investing X monthly into the business, what can I get for this'. The owners need to look out for their long-term future but so do you. Shares or share options seem a viable option. 

I think you are in a good position but you may have slightly the wrong mindset. You are not an employee and as such you don't have job security in the same way you would have (or not have) if you were employed. You are a contractor who has a good relationship with a client. You can and even should ask them about what work is in the pipeline. A good relationship goes both ways so they will want to keep you on if they can. However, this is not always possible as often external resources, like yourself, are not financially viable in the longer term. What you can do is be proactive about the situation: 

But for you this can be a huge opportunity. You are just out of college with few commitments you can have a big impact into the success of this startup. 

There is another possibility: That while the team were happy hiring you their decision was overruled. Often hiring decisions stay within the local team before getting a final sign off from higher up. It does seem to fit the evidence. It was not just yourself that spent a lot of time, the company did as well. They would not do this if they were not seriously interested. It sounds like it was the final authorisation that caused the issue. I've seen it from the other side, where I have interviewed a good candidate for a role where there was supposed to be a job and to be told that it was not possible to hire them. It is unlikely that the company would let on if this was the case, to say 'we have no budget', or 'we have a hiring freeze' or 'the sales team blew the budget on their team building trip to Venice' is not something they would say to somebody in your position. While it is disappointing it does happen.
