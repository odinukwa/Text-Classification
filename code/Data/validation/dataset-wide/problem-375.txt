I'd say take a look at John Varley's Gaea. OK not her/it in particular but toroidal habitats in general. The idea of having them replicate themselves starting from an asteroid and a seed is a great idea if somewhat beyond current technology. Why spend time and risk lives building them when you could engineer the first seed and plant it in an asteroid belt and wait? If you want to avoid that degree of future tech then your model is O'Neill colonies. You solve a lot of problems by not needing vast amounts of matter to create gravity at the surface. Instead you create pseudo gravity by living inside a rotating wheel. If it is large enough the coriolis effect is tolerably small. In passing: if an AI ever tells you that it is getting senile, take it seriously. 

I've always thought that if humans had made a stronger distinction between fingers and thumbs, we'd have counted in eights (octal). That makes conversion to binary trivially easy and computers (mechanical ones) might have arrived a lot sooner. Anyway, there have been other number systems in history. Babylon used base-sixty, which can be subdivided as six tens or five twelves. Both were used. Sixty can be divided exactly by two, three, four, five, six, ten and twelve (and by eight using halves), which is useful to a mercantile society. More recently base-20 was popular, subdivided in fours and fives. Vestiges survive in various somewhat obscure shepherd's dialects ( $URL$ ) and in the French for ninety (quatre-vingt dix, four twenties and ten). "Dix" is ten in many of those shepherd's dialects, showing a common origin (Celtic ). 

I once knew a man who suffered a degree of diffuse brain damage after an event that would have been fatal without CPR. He made a full recovery in about a year both as far as he could tell and as far as friends could tell. During his recovery he was repeatedly frustrated by "knowing he knew" something but not being able to access it. It could be as little as one word, intermediate like how to program in Pascal, or huge like most of his life as a teenager. Mostly the memories returned, which suggests they were still there but no longer properly connected, like (crude analogy) a computer disk with a corrupt file index. Sleep is known to be required to lay down memories. It is also known to be involved in forgetting. The same processes may discover disconnected memories and reconnect them. Obviously he could not tell how many memories were recovered internally and how many were patched back from external sources. Not really an answer, but this may be a useful insight. The issue for replacement of a large chunk of brain tissue with new "blank" tissue is to what degree memory is distributed. We are evolved to deal with single brain cells dying every day, and to have a reasonable ability to survive individual small lesions and micro-strokes (often without noticing). My colleague lost some years-worth of random brain cells in a few minutes of oxygen deprivation. But there are brain functions that are not fully distributed, such as motor functions. Lose all the tissue containing such a vital localised function and the damage may not be reversible merely with replacement tissue. There is a lot that we do not know about brains! 

Antarctica. Judging by the evidence that has been shipped by mistake ( Xmas cards featuring reindeer and penguins ) the Claus corporation relocation has already started. 

Supplementary answer: poultry and hawks Poultry are a very good way of converting stuff that you can't eat into stuff that you can (eggs, chickenmeat). If you have a beast of burden they are fairly easy to transport from camp-site to camp-site in small cages or even just with wings bound and dangled by their legs. Live meat keeps a lot better than dead meat. Obviously the terrain has to be fertile enough for hens to forage from if you want to keep them indefinitely. Here on Earth it's not known how long ago the domesticated Burmese jungle fowl (or hen) was traded across Asia all the way to Europe. At the dawn of written history, hens were onmipresent. It didn't take long for them to be everywhere in the Americas as well, once we introduced them. A trained hawk is a huge asset in arid terrain that cannot support hens, if your culture has invented falconry. It can hunt desert or grassland creatures that you probably couldn't hunt yourself. 

There's the elephant. We don't call the noise it makes "trumpeting" for nothing. Interestingly elephants can also "sing" in the infrasonic (below 20hz) which few if any other animals can hear but which elephants can hear twenty miles away. And there are songbirds such as the nightingale, thrushes and (UK) blackbird. If you record their song and slow it down you realize a lot of what a human hears as trilling is far more complex patterns of notes that no human flautist could play. And if you whistle or play a melody in their range of pitch often enough a wild blackbird may first copy it and then start "composing" variations on your theme. A while ago the BBC reported a farmer who'd rigged a radio so his pigs could change channel and adjust the volume using their snouts. The pigs showed a marked preference for classical music over pop! 

Prime numbers are a very good start. There is no known natural process that generates them. Once you have established primes as the context by transmitting the first few in some transparently simple coding scheme such as a number of pulses separated by silence, you can then repeat the same with gradually improved coding schemes, including checksums and redundancy and message start / end codes. And then you can transmit a large number that has only two prime factors M and N followed by M lines of N Bits. If maths is a universal language it ought to be obvious to assemble the lines as "black" and "white" pixels in a 2D grid. We're now transmitting imagery. Whether we are perceived as intelligent or as moronic now depends on other factors far less definite than mathematical fact. 

Read Charles Stross Rule 34 for some ideas! Do you control a robot vacuum cleaner that can do stairs? Park it three or four treads from the top. Put in a call to the maintenance company saying it has broken down. Set off the fire alarms at 3 am. If he doesn't trip and break his neck you can explain to him you were trying to warn him about the vac but he didn't hear you over the alarm. Even better if you can somehow cause the vac to emit smoke. I made that one up. Charles Stross has a better imagination. Don't they have autonomous cars in this future? 

There is another scaling law to consider. Weight decreases with gravity but mass and inertia do not. Worse, friction force depends on pressure. Less weight means less pressure on feet. So a large creature in low gravity would not collapse under its own weight, but it might have great difficulty getting moving, dodging or stopping. Methinks in low gravity the top predators might combine the less pleasant features of rats and army ants.
