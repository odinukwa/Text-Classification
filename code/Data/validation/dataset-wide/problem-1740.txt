The numbers 3, 5 and 7 in i3, i5 and i7 are just part of the branding -- they aren't actually counting 3, 5 or 7 of anything, any more than the old 80386 CPUs actually had 80,386 of anything. 

Yes, you can, because there's no such thing as a "domain name for a server". Domain names are not attached to servers. You can buy any domain name you want, that's not already owned by someone else, and then map it to any IP address you want. It doesn't matter what, if anything, is currently attached to the Internet on that IP address. Having said that, if you buy the domain triplehotxxxbabes.com and point it at your school's server then they may not be very happy with you. 

To what level of granularity are you measuring your peak traffic? If your peak is 60Mbps measured at a 1 millisecond level, then extra bandwidth is unlikely to help. But if it's at a 5 minute level of granularity, then it's likely that you're experiencing a bit of clipping of transient peaks in network traffic. You'd need to do more detailed measurement to quantify the amount of clipping and its effect on site performance. 

I have a site with a relatively low amount of traffic that's normally served happily by 3 or 4 passenger instances. However, sometimes it is getting hammered by a large number of automated requests that can take up to 15-20 seconds to completed. This results in the global queue backing up and the server becoming unresponsive to ordinary users: 

As far as I can tell, this is enabled in the BIOS (or at least Multiprocessor Specification is set to 1.4) 

$URL$ <- screenshot of bios Am I mis-interpreting the lspcu output? Or is there something else I need to do to enable this? Thanks 

I'm not sure if this is the ideal solution, but for lack of any better idea, I wrote a short script to monitor this and call cpulimit for me. I've included it below incase it's of use to anyone else. 

You have two entirely separate connections. The connection from the web browser to nginx is encrypted with SSL, and so nginx has to be configured for SSL. The connection from nginx to Apache to retrieve the data for nginx to send to the browser should be a regular http connection with no SSL, so Apache doesn't need to have any SSL configuration. 

You'll also lose everything on the m3.medium's instance-store volume, unless you copy it to an EBS volume first. 

You've got a bad glue record for ns2.maisturismo.net -- it thinks it's on 67.213.220.17, not 67.213.220.171. 

If you're using the naked domain (e.g. example.com) for your website, then it's not a 1-and-1 limitation but a DNS limitation. This is why you should never use naked domains for websites -- always use www.example.com (or some other subdomain) instead. 

What you should do is include all of your domains (example.tld and www.example.tld) in the SAN and the domain that's used by most of your users (most likely www.example.tld) in the Common Name. That will protect all access except access to example.tld from browsers that don't support SAN. Most certificate companies should support that configuration. 

You can use a and daisy chain the to require the config change(s). If the Exec fails (exit status != 0) the subsequent tasks that require it should fail as well. I do something similar to execute ssh-keygen then set special permissions on .ssh when creating new users. Example: 

Start by disabling the default site (). If you're not serving content there, then remove it. The order in which sites are loaded matters (that's why default is prefixed with 000). The default site will be the first .conf loaded (based on alphabetical ordering). If you have set in your default.conf, then it will respond regardless of the vHosts that come after it. Once you disable the default site, bounce apache, and comment below if it doesn't work. we'll try something else. 

As an updated answer, on Ubuntu 16.04.1 I was able to do the following to resize a volume from 1024GB to 1.4TB: 

I have a Centos 7.3 server running a dual socket quad core Intel Xeon CPU E5620 @ 2.40GHz. I would like to use hyperthreading on this server but it seems it has been disabled. The spec sheet for this chip indicates it should support hyperthreading: 

My understanding is that I should be seeing two threads per core instead of just the single thread. I've had a good hunt around and the only suggestions I could find where to make sure I had an smp kernel running (I think this is the default behaviour now, but based on the name above, my kernel has it), or to try and pass to the kernel via grub at boot. (Didn't help, but acpi was already enabled so I wasn't really expecting this to do much) This page here: $URL$ indicates that you should be able to turn it on/off by echoing 0 or 1 into 

"Getting the right part number" generally would involve talking to somebody at Dell, or a reseller. You can also troll through the technical information that Dell provides on their website, but honestly when faced with similar snipe hunts in the past, I would have had better luck trolling eBay for keywords; in this case "Dell R710 Backplane". A cursory glance tells me "W814D" is the part#. But I am not endorsing that, YMMV, please do your own research. All of that being said: Generally Dell doesn't ship machines like that. If it has 6 bays open on the front, it will have a 6-bay SAS backplane installed. Depending on how things were originally ordered, they might not have cabled the second upstream port on the backplane; but I would find that suspicious too. I would make sure all the SFF cables are in place, and what they are being cabled to (could one be going to a PERC and another to an onboard port or something equally weird/dumb?) 

The domain name doesn't need any particular configuration -- anyone can create a CNAME for any domain they own, pointing to any other domain name. The server will presumably need to be configured to do the short URL expansion for bit.ly Pro paying customers, and block all other domain names that may be CNAMEd to cname.bit.ly by non-customers. 

Looks like your domain registration has expired -- cleangreenpgh.com is on Client Hold status. The expiry date is showing as 2015 because they temporarily add a year to an expired domain to give you a chance to renew before it becomes generally available. See the relevant help page here. 

The reason for setting the header to vary by user agent is that Apache's recommended configuration for mod_deflate serves uncompressed versions of some content to Netscape 4 users. There are probably few enough Netscape 4 users now that you can just serve compressed content to all browsers that claim to support it, and not vary by user agent. So instead of the recommended configuration: 

Oh, and be sure in Redmine's Administration page you point it at the proper url, otherwise it won't generate links correctly... 

Well this is a loaded one...Breaking it down Number of Members You're not going to get that, most likely, given the way the VC is depicted over SNMP. There is no current "member count" value in the OID tree. your best bet would be to walk and count the Serial numbers returned (or use the memberID, or MACs, or whatever). It looks like you're using Icinga, so you're probably going to want to use a script to grab that OID and count the results, since Icinga won't do that for you. I do similar things for dozens of other situations in Nagios. (I beat out a quick script based on some of those situations; use it, or use it as an example to do what you want: $URL$ Status of Members I see of no (easy) way to get present/not present statuses. That one you might just have to punt on, or monitor the VCP interfaces themselves one by one. Role Changes This would be a good one to use traps for; but if you're set on using polling and you are statically setting priorities so that you know what your master/backup will be most of the time, then you can look at the values under ; node .0 will be member 0, node .1 will be member 1, and so on. A value of 1 is Master, 2 is Backup, and 3 is Linecard (that's available in the MIB itself). The problem is that if you leave all that up to the dynamics of a default virtual chassis set up, without setting mastership priorities static member IDs (based on serial numbers), etc, those values could change.
