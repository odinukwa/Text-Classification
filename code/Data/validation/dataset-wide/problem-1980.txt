Assume that anything you write will be traceable back to you because despite best efforts to hide the source, the person receiving the criticism will almost surely figure out where specific comments came from. They will hold it against you, even if you had good intentions with pointing out what needs to be "worked on". Thus, if you are "friendly" with the colleague then it is best to not mention anything negative in the review. If you aren't all that impressed with their work but want to maintain your "friendly" situation then just don't write a glowing review. No need for any negatives. If you really want to help the person then give suggestions for how the person can improve face to face, not through formal channels. Either way, your comments will trace back to you and writing negative comments is going to end up in a face to face anyways. Your wanting to be "helpful" will come across as being far more sincere if you handle the situation face to face instead of back dooring through the review process. 

I agree with Wesley on not maintaining the "Holder of Knowledge" status. While it might seem like a blessing while you are in the spotlight, the problem becomes that you end up too important to move anywhere else because there's no one else who could take over your current role. Then you become stuck in a spot where you aren't learning anything new and it no longer gets attention from the higher ups. Then that blessing becomes a curse. The way I look at it, the quicker I can get a project done and leave it in good enough shape for someone else to take over, the sooner I get to do something new, which usually means expanding my skill set. Also, there's two variations on that "local expert" theme. You can be the expert because you are the only one with experience in a particular area. Which means, you have knowledge but not necessarily expertise. That's a thin line to walk, because if the company hires someone else with experience with the skill then you can easily be exposed for not being so smart after all. The other variation is you have about the same technical knowledge as most others but you know how to wield that knowledge in much better ways than others. That's where you want to be. The holder of knowledge, will likely not ever achieve that because it usually requires utilizing a wide array of skills in order to achieve it. If you are pigeon holed into your one area of expertise, then you lose out on opportunities to widen your skill set and learn even better ways to utilize your knowledge. Thus, don't be afraid to share knowledge. You can get your "knowledge" out there without losing your status. The student seldom becomes as good as a true master. Yet another bad analogy...I know how to nail, hammer and saw but I could never compete with a carpenter. If you teach others to nail, hammer and saw then you can pass your old projects on to them and move on to bigger and better projects with new skill sets to learn. 

My son had a similar problem (allergic to more than just pollen) and I can attest that having to listen to sniffling for a period of time really, really, really does get on your nerves. And I love my son very much and I knew it wasn't his fault. Yet, you can't help that it gets on your nerves. Your co-workers don't love you (if they even like you), so I can imagine their tolerance is much lower than mine with my son. So their being shrill with you may not be intentional, just that having to listen to it over time can make one really irritable. Knowing that your allergies do indeed have a negative impact on your co-workers (I know much more so on you, but you asked what you can do) then I think it really rests on you to resolve the issue and get it under control. Even if it means seeing a dozen different doctors until one helps. That's what we did. We had to drive 1 1/2 hours each way to see this particular allergist and he finally got not only the sniffling but the "raw skin" from scratching under control. He had to be at least the 12th doctor, if not more. My wife would not accept the "we can't do anything more, just wait for him to outgrow it" for an answer and it paid off. The end result was a couple of core medications, but when those didn't work we had 3 or 4 different backups including a nasal spray, and when that didn't work it was time for the steroid medication. Thankfully, my son has outgrown most of these problems. But the bottom line is if the doctor you are seeing isn't helping then go see someone else. There's someone out there who can help; you just need to find them. So what you can tell your co-workers is that you are aggressively attempting to get this under control and you are sorry for it annoying them. I really don't think you can hold it against them that they are irritable from having to listen to sniffling all day long. 

I take 2 approaches depending on if I want the position for the salary increase or for getting my foot in the door at the company. Salary increase: Figure out what is the lowest you would accept and add some percentage on top of that. Like you, I always include the but it depends on the whole package thing because I always renegotiate for an extra weeks vacation since that is more important than the extra money or signing bonus too me. Foot in the door: I would like the median salary for the position you are hiring me for. That way you don't start at the low end of the scale but also don't start so high that it scares them off or they can't give you raises in the future, which would also scare them off. Of course the company could lie about what that dollar amount is, but I think they understand that if you come aboard you'll find out that number anyways so why risk having a disgruntled worker. 

ALWAYS ASK BEFORE CONCLUDING AN INTERVIEW: Is there anything where I might not be meeting your expectations that might be a concern for your hiring me? You won't always get a honest answer, but frequently you'll get something like, "We were really hoping to find someone who has expertise in XXX". This gives you the opportunity to make your case that you really do have expertise in XXX. Assuming that you really do. Sometimes it is hard to know what the interviewer thinks is important. Thus, you may have focused your answers in the wrong direction and given the wrong impression of your skill level in other areas. This question helped cover me a couple of times as I did get to alleviate their concerns. If the OP had asked this question then they very well could have had a different outcome. With that said, I see no problem in writing a letter where you emphasize your "in-depth knowledge in the field" WITH CONCRETE EXAMPLES. If you truly do have the background, they may very well reconsider, assuming they actually read the letter. Generally, it only takes 1 out of several interviewers to say no in order to get rejected. Maybe one of the people that liked you may take this letter and use it to get some reconsideration. Nothing to lose if you do it tactfully and respectfully. If there's any tone of sour grapes then you could forever get put on the do not hire list. 

I've worked for a company like this. My manager had 125 developers working for them. Needless to say, they didn't have time to do all the paperwork involved with managing that number of people. That's where the group leaders came into play. Group leaders are assigned 7 or 8 people to their team. The group leaders were responsible for monitoring, guiding and promoting the accomplishments of the people on their team. This also involved doing most of the paperwork that the manager would have ordinarily had to do. If you want to succeed in a company organized like this then you had better become well acquainted with your group leader and make sure they are well acquainted with you and your accomplishments on the job. When it comes time for raises and promotions, generally what happens is the group leaders and the manager all meet in a room and start "stacking" the employees. Every group leader tries to get "their" people ranked highest on the stack because that determines whether you get promoted and/or how good of a raise you get. Your job as an employee is to make sure your group leader has the "ammunition" they need to get your ranking as high as possible. Making sure they have a clear-cut bullet list of accomplishments and responsibilities is how you do that. The other aspect that is critical, is that the rankings are done based on your current position/title. So if you are looking to rank high then you'd better be doing the responsibilities that would ordinarily be performed by a person in a position 1 level higher than you currently are. You need to make sure that your group leader's bullet list emphasizes those responsibilities. You can be doing quite exceptional at doing exactly the job you are supposed to be doing. However, if someone at your same level is doing a good job performing the duties ordinarily expected of someone a level higher then they'll be ranked higher than you. So, to more directly answer your questions, it is a legitimate process. The reason for doing it this way is because your manager has a different set of responsibilities than a manager at a company with a traditional smaller team organizational structure. Managers like this are working on higher level issues than the day to day interactions of a typical manager. In particular, making sure that they have enough work to keep 125 SW developers off of overhead and making sure they have enough developers to do all the work that is required. They need to make sure of all this not only for the now, but also for the upcoming year or 2 ahead. Given that your manager can't meet individually with everyone on a regular basis then your group leader is essentially your representative to your manager. The manager does meet on a regular basis with their group leaders. The reason for the 1:1s is:
