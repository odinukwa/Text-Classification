Now that you have extensively modified your question (in particular the stars now rising in the east), then yes this is Orion. The upper bright star is Betelgeuse - you should be able to see that it is red - and the lower bright star is Rigel, which is bluish white. The 3 stars in the middle form Orion's belt. 

It's most probably Sirius. At this time of year (at 1 am local time) it's low in the sky in the East, so there is a lot of atmosphere in the way, and as Sirius is a bright bluish star, it will show all the colours described as it twinkles. 

At the vernal equinox, the sun crosses the celestial equator, and by definition, it has an RA of 0h (at the current epoch). At mid-day on that day, the sun will be more or less due south, and as the line of zero RA forms a great circle, the RA "overhead" will also be zero. The sun won't be exactly zero RA except at the moment of the equinox, and also the length of the solar day varies throughout the year, which results in the time at which the sun is due south is not quite 12 noon by clock time. All the above is independent of whether or not you are observing from Greenwich. 

You should definitely be able to see the 4 main moons of Jupiter. You won’t need additional magnification - they can be seen through 10 x binoculars. It’s possible that when you looked the moons were close to or behind Jupiter, so worth trying again. Or it may be that James is right and you were looking at a star. As for the bands on Jupiter, these are quite subtle but at 60x magnification, 2 dark bands should be visible. Don’t expect to see the Great Red Spot, at least initially. 

This may seem like a cheat, but why not just look up the star in a catalogue, or using one of the several free astronomy planetarium type apps - eg Stellarium, Cartes du Ciel etc. The star in question, nor any one is likely to find, is not unknown. 

I do not have one of these scopes, so my answer reflects general knowledge of astronomical telescopes. Yes, the lens should be at the far end, away from your eye. As for the alignment question, you can probably get a bit more movement in "left/right" direction by loosening the screws that hold the base of the finder to the scope, and twisting the mount and then re-tighten it. For the up/down adjustment, you may need to use a shim (a thin bit of metal) to adjust the angle, but the adjustment built into the finder is normally adequate. I doubt if there is a problem with the scope - if you can get a good focus, that's fine. 

The date on the charts shows the meridian (north south line) at 8pm local time on that date. Over a period of a month, the RA of the meridian will move 2hr (so that it gets back to where it started from after 12 months), and hence over 16 days, as you ask about, it will move 1.05 hours. So you can either say that's close enough to 1 hr, or worry about the small discrepancy - that's assuming the 1hr you cite is actually 1.00hrs. 

As you say you know nothing about what a lot of the specs mean, it's hard to know where to start. Here are a few points. Objective diameter 60mm: this is the diameter of the lens at the front (objective). The size of the objective determines how faint are the things that you can see. Under the right conditions (very dark and clear night sky) 60mm will show many great astronomical objects, but it is generally the smallest size you will see for astro telescopes. This is because the objective size also determines how much detail can be seen (again bigger is better), but also this is heavily dependent on the quality of the lens, and in a $100 telescope you shouldn't expect too much. This has a knock on effect on how much usable magnification you can get out of the scope. A rule of thumb is that the maximum usable magnification is about 50 times the size of the objective (in inches) - about 120 times in this case - assuming excellent optical quality. Eyepieces: I suspect that only the H 20 and H 12.5 will be usable as the SR 4, giving 225 magnification) will just produce a blur (and anything in the night sky you look at will be very hard to keep track as the earth rotates). The optical design gives a narrow field of vie, and it is unlikely that you would be able to see the whole of the moon in the same field of view, which you may find disappointing. Tripod: no detail is given, but at this price it is unlikely to be very stable (in other words wobble like a jelly). 

In a Newtonian reflector, as pictured, the secondary mirror does block some of the light, but maybe less than you think. Even if the secondary were half the diameter of the primary, it would only block 1/4 of the light ($\ (1/2)^2$). In a more typical case the secondary would be somewhat smaller - perhaps a quarter of the size of the primary (or less). Hence a $1/16th$ or less is blocked, which is not too bad. 

Part of the confusion stems from the words used. "higher" resolution doesn't mean better, it means only bigger objects can be resolved; but we want to be able to resolve small objects, such as the angular distance between a pair of double stars. So small is better in this situation. 

If your sunrise had been earlier than expected, it would have been the same around the world, and would have been noticed very widely. Here is a chart showing times of sunrise/set at your location. 

It's difficult to answer this question with any confidence, since it is so wide ranging, and the original poster has not (yet) provided any clarification. However, it seems likely that the book "Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus, published by Willmann-Bell, will provide the answer(s). Failing that, the publisher's website contains several other reference works on this topic. I have no affiliation with the publisher or author. Finally, as the author of the question is a beginner, I wonder whether in fact a simple introduction to astronomy, of which there are hundreds, might be a better place to start. Jumping in by trying to model the positions of stars looks hard, particularly as there are plenty of good applications already available, some of which are free. 

It was Nova Aquilae 1918. Wikipedia has some detail. $URL$ Apparently it was discovered by Zygmunt Laskowski, an amateur astronomer. 

No, it's not Florence. Florence is quite faint - 9th magnitude currently- so about 1/15th of the brightness of the faintest star visible to the unaided eye. If it were a long enough exposure to show Florence, there would likely be other stars visible in the picture. And although Florence is moving quite quickly, I doubt it's moving as fast as appears in your photo, but without knowing how long the exposure is, it's hard to be definitive. In addition, the brightness appears to vary, which suggests that is could be a satellite, or a meteor, or possibly an aeroplane. 

Astro solar filter is good. Baader Planetarium make this: $URL$ I have used this filter in front of a 4 inch refractor with no adverse effects. I don't know where you are based but this product should be easily obtainable in the UK, USA and Germany. I have no affiliation with the company. 

Eric Pauer, who produced the chart, has an interesting web site that covers this eclipse. It is evident that the weather was not great at the time of the eclipse, with intermittent cloud, and it will have been passing clouds that caused the variations in intensity. You can see the evidence from this page $URL$ 

Just divide the actual distance by the magnification. In your example that would give 750 million /50, which is 15 million miles. (Actually saturn is currently over 800 million miles from earth). The reason this works is that a magnification of M means the object is M times its apparent linear size, which requires being M times closer. This is a slight approximation, but is fine for distant objects. 

The reason is because the moon moves much faster (in terms of angle per day) than the sun. In fact it moves on average 12.5 degrees per day, and all in the same direction. Given that the sun is only about 0.5 degrees in diameter, it doesn't take long for the moon to overtake it, and once it's past it doesn't go backwards. 

You can start by working out how fast a galaxy must be receding if its peculiar velocity (given as about 600 km/s) is less than or equal to 10% of its expansion velocity. I'm not going to spell out the next step as you said you don't know where to start. 

I recommend that you learn your way around the night sky, so start by buying a book of star charts. Next try a book that covers interesting objects in each constellation, such as Burnham's Celestial Handbook, or The Constellations by Motz & Nathanson. This should keep you busy for a while. 

As far as I can see, this is just a faint star. Here is some data from the USNO B1.0 catalogue: USNO B1.0 star B1.0 ID: 0940-0181715 RA: 10h10m11.13s +/- 69 milliarcseconds declination: + 4 03' 12.3" +/- 195 milliarcseconds Epoch: 1977.9 Proper motion in RA: 12 +/- 2 milliarcseconds/year Proper motion in dec: 6 +/- 6 milliarcseconds/year Photometry: Band mag Cal Survey Emulsi field S/G xi eta B1: 14.36 1 POSS-I 103a-O 550 4 -0.05 0.03 R1: 13.33 1 POSS-I 103a-E 550 1 0.05 0.01 B2: 14.07 2 POSS-II IIIa-J 782 9 0.09 0.26 R2: 12.79 2 POSS-II IIIa-F 782 8 -0.07 -0.02 I: 12.37 2 POSS-II IV-N 781 -0.04 -0.30 "Cal" = calibration: 0 means calibrated via bright standard stars on the plate; 1 = via faint standards on the plate; 2 = faint standards on adjacent plate; 3 = faint standards two plates away, etc. "S/G" = star/galaxy index. 11=object looked starlike, to 0=fuzzy/galaxy-like. xi, eta = displacement of the star's position on this plate, in arcseconds, relative to the mean solution. This USNO-B1.0 data was downloaded from a VizieR server. 

It is possible to get usable photos of astronomical objects using a camera phone, but as @Glorfindel and @Jee say, in this case you need to reduce the exposure time. There are apps that give more control over the camera than the standard app (well that's true for iphones, not sure about others), which are free, or not expensive. Using a filter would probably not work because the standard camera app is probably averaging the brightness over an area centred on Venus, so will likely just lengthen the exposure to compensate, getting you back to where you started. 

First of all, what do stars look like through the scope, particular just inside and outside focus? If they are oval, then read on. I'm not familiar with this telescope, but I suspect the most likely sources of the problem are 1. The corrector lens you mention (which is a relatively unusual thing to have) is distorted. If you can't remove this, then you are stuck with it. 2. The adjustment screws on the secondary mirror may be too tight, thereby distorting the shape of the . Try loosening each screw by a small amount, say 1/8th of a turn, and see if this improves things. Make sure the telescope tube is horizontal when you do this in case the secondary slips off its mount. 

You will get the maximum magnification by using the 10mm eyepiece with the barlow lens. You cannot connect 2 eyepieces in the way you suggest, but even if you could add the 10 and the 25 to get a 35mm, that would give lower magnification, as I explained in a previous answer. 

If I have understood your attached file correctly, it shows your location as latitude 45.3, and longitude -80.4. I don't know where that is, but it's not Kansas City. 

No, it's not real. Given that the moon appears to be nearly full, it would be near to the horizon opposite the sun, which is clearly not the case. Also the framing of the sun and moon between the trees means that the sun and moon are on the same side of the trees, which is not possible when the moon is full. 

I can't vouch for the formula, but you can try it out and check with some internet source, eg USNO, to see if it works. If the formula is correct, that's it. As for the sidereal time in Sydney, you need the difference in longitude between Greenwich and Sydney, and use the conversion rate of 15 degrees longitude is equivalent to 1 hour.
