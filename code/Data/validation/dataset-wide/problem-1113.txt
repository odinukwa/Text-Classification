R is stored with heap organization with data unsorted with both respect to K and A, in pages of size Dpag=1024 bytes each. I have an array giving me the following costs for heap organizations (but actually for deletion it is Cs+1). 

I have to create a check to know if the date in Livraison (Delivery in French) is >= Date in Commande (Order in French) 

I think that the answer in relational algebra is : ΠConstructor(Product ⋈ Laptop ⋈ Printer) Yet I don't know how to write it in SQL, would it be : 

I am trying to import a csv file into Cassandra which is very long. These are food products: ingredients, nutrition, labels... It comes from Open Food Data. List information on food products: ingredients, nutritional information, labels, etc. Most of the data comes from crowdsourcing information. The file this envelope of the open platform of French public data.gouv.fr The command I tried I try the following command with all the columns that I was able to collect with a python script: 

So, anyway, it was a combination of a whole bunch of different things, mostly related to SQL, but not exclusively (so Will was correct there). I'd love to split the answer between everyone, as they had portions of it right, but what can you do... 

change the autogrowth settings so I'd have consistent growth when it happens, manually grew both the temp and primary database files to have more space, added additional vlogs to the temp database, and set up a notification so I can manually grow when the database gets below a certain space level. [nothing to be done about it] made the heavy query run less often; it was loading up data the user didn't always need, so changed it to run on-demand [working on getting a new server, this app is growing fast] [working on getting a new server, this app is growing fast] 

Yet I did the advised settings Apache gave in order to make the data persitent I tried to run a and it gave me back : 

I have several csv files on university courses that all seem linked by an ID, that you can find here, and I wondered how to put them on Elasticsearch. I know, thanks to this video and Logstash, how to insert one sole file csv file to Elasticsearch. But do you know how to insert several such as those in the provided link ? At the moment I started with a first file for a first csv file : . But it would be painful to write them all... The file is : 

Looking then at their closures: [AB]⁺={A,B,C,D,E,G} [BC]⁺={B,C,A,D,E,G} The teacher then did something about closures I don't perfectly understand: F¹⁺=∅ F²⁺=∅ F³⁺={AD → E, B → D, AB → D,AB → E} 

I have a fairly high-throughput application that occasionally decides to collapse on me. It's not very often - about once every ~3 weeks or so. When it does, if I check out perfmon, I see 100% "Avg. Disk Queue Length" pegging the server. During these times, I also see lots of nice connection failed messages from SQL Server. I'm no SQL Server expert, I can do the basics for indexing, taking backups, etc., but that's it. What would cause something like this? I was thinking perhaps it was a resize of the database (it was down to ~300MB available [and it's a 30 gig database]), or maybe some reindexing gone nuts? I do have one table in particular that has tons of inserts. Very few reads, but many inserts per second isn't unusual at all. The server has only ~4 gig of RAM as well, but we do have a dedicated warehouse box that rolls up data every night where most of the heavy querying is directed. Anyone got any thoughts on what might cause that huge queue length? 

I would say that those which aren't equality searches are those that may have less benefices from the multi-attribute index, but I'm not sure why... Here is an an example of a multi-attribute index (which remains as a link for I don't know which reason ... : 

According to my teacher the number of deleted records for an attribute operation is Nrec(R)/Lr = 100000/100 = 100. But I don't understand why. Therfore the cost of the operation would be : Npage+100. 

Update May, 3rd Without knowing how to use a file to implement csv files to Elasticsearch, I fell back to Elastic blog and tried to do a shell script for a first file before trying to generalize the approach : importCSVFiles : 

Yet, it creates some issues when trying to ask to the database which are the clients that never ordered product number one? Indeed, I don't know how to do it in SQL as far as it seems that there is no relations between Client, Commande and Produit. It gived the following sql code: 

I'm transitioning from an old web/sql box combined to a much more robust solution on a completely different host (800hosting to RackSpace). Our application has very high uptime requirements. It runs 24x7x365 and impacts literally thousands of sites, and I want to ensure the minimum possible downtime during the transition. (Don't ask how we're pulling this off with a single box right now.) My plan for the web server is a little bit of DNS work to point a new subdomain to the new server setup, and forward requests from the existing server. That'll take care of flipping everyone to the new web box fast enough. The problem is the database - how do I keep it in sync until I'm ready to flip the switch on the website (or is it worth the effort vs. just accepting the downtime to stop the app, backup, compress, transfer, and restore?). A few details. We're running Sql2k5 on the old system, 2k8r2 on the new. The database itself is ~30 gigs for the primary, ~60 gigs for the warehouse. I can live with downtime on the warehouse, but really want to minimize the impact on the main database. Any suggestions for the best way to migrate the database across from the old setup to the new? 

C → D shouldn't be lost but isn't in F¹ nor in F². Why is it important to say that? (from F¹) and (from F²) therefore, The result which I don't understand at all is that it is without loss of dependencies... 

I know this wrong, not enough accurate. Can you help me learning how to create an accurate and right trigger? The related database scheme in UML is (in French, unfortunately): 

I'm trying to import a large one giga tsv file names . It is in ̀ but seems there is a syntax error : 

Then she did: [AB]⁺⇔ AB → C; AB → D; AB → E; AB → G [AB]⁺ ∪ F³⁺={A,B,D,E,G}, C isn't in [AB]⁺ ∪ F³⁺ Therefore it isn't a dependency preserving decomposition Can you help me understand why?
