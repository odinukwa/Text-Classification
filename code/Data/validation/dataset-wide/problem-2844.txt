Quine names the belief in this distinction the first dogma of empiricism and he refutes it. He links the first dogma with a second dogma (reductionism) and states in paragraph 5: 

One could say much more about the relation between different events, about the relativity of time and concerning the question: Does the future really happen, or why does it seem to us as if the future will happen? But my answer were more focused if you explain a bit more the aim of your question. 

The statement "God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent" and "Evil exists in the world" is a contradiction. You yourself give the argument in the question. I do not know about a logical trick to work around this contradiction by employing a different calculus of logic. I doubt whether a different calculus resolves the contradiction. Of course, paraconsistent logic does not presuppose the principle "ex falso quodlibet", hence it does not banish contradictions; see $URL$ But I do not know what to conclude from this contradiction by employing paraconsistent logic. In my opinion, a contradiction which results from such plain and simple statements should not prompt looking for a workaround. Instead, one should identify the reason of the contradiction and correct it. Here the reason is the combination of three contradictory concepts. I assume you know about Leibniz' attempt to solve the theodicy problem by employing the concept of possible worlds. But as far as I know, he did not invent modal logic as a calculus to deal with this concept on a logical base. 

I do not remember any passage where Plato refers to the Jewish religion or to Jewish mythology. Sometimes Plato refers to myths he pretends to have heard from Egyptians and possibly he invented some myths by himself. E.g., he refers to the myth of Atlantis and he himself traveled to Italy and had contact with he school of Pythagoras and their myths of transmigration. But I do not remember any reference to the Torah. In Plato's time Israel was a Persian province. It did not play any role outside the country. I think that Justinus tried a bit to revise history in order to strengthen his message. 

The basic term in Aristotle (Nicomachean ethics = EN) is the term "virtue". Aristotle introduces and examines a series of virtues - e.g., in Latin: prudentia, fortitudo, temperantia, iustitia. Often, but not always they follow the principle: Virtue is located between two extremes. Aristotle emphasizes that one needs some experience of life to put in practice theoretical knowledge about virtue. Therefore one should regard people with more experience in acting virtuously. (EN II, 1f.) Considered that way I do not think that it is a vicious circle. 

Comments like "it can be easily shown" should be the exception. On the opposite, it is the task of the reader to follow the proof or the arguments of the author by careful study. But he is not obliged to develop a proof of his own. The situation is a bit different in the case of an academic textbook. Sometimes the author does not fill in all details of a proof. Instead he urges the reader to complete the proof as an exercise. But the claims in a textbook do not refer to new results. In general their proofs can be found in other textbooks. 

I try to satisfy your requirements 2) - 4). But I do not understand your point 1). What is the requirement here? Added: This working definition classifies the following issues named in the OP's comment: 

Nearly all people assume that conscisousness exists, epiphenomenalists are not distinguished in this respect. The general belief in consciousness results from the fact, that everybody experiences himself as beeing conscious. Epiphenomenalists do not claim that consciousness is an agent in human actions. Because they - like all other scientists until today - cannot show a causal relation between the subjective experience of consciousness and our objective and observable actions. Epiphenomenalists accept the present state of a causally closed physical domain. They do not speculate beyond the limits of present explanations. 

The short answer: The scientists themselves keep track of science. The means are publications, conferences and appointments to academic positions. Hence it is not the single scientist, but the community of sciencists who determine the path of their subject. On a more abstract level, Kuhn in his seminal essay Kuhn, Thomas: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. (1962) discriminates two different phases of science: The normal phase, where all scientists work according to a well-established paradigm. And the revolutionary phase with the successfull proposal and implementation of a groundbreaking new paradigm. 

1) In the case of quantum mechanics the observation of spectral lines had to be explained. 2) The Schrödinger equation, embedded in the theoretical framework of quantum mechanics, explains the discreteness of the spectral lines and facilitates computing their corresponding frequencies for the most simple atoms like Hydrogen or Helium. 3) Further subtle observations of spectral lines detected the fine structure. 4) The introduction of electron spin allows to explain the fine structure. Quantum mechanics did not change this established scientific method. Also Popper’s emphasis on the principle of falsification is not restricted to quantum mechanics. It is an idealized description of the relation between experiment and theory, which applies to all natural sciences. Falsification is independent from Popper’s opinion concerning the Copenhagen interpretation. A paradigm for the revolutionary step of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. It shows that the classical concept with physical observables, having always a definite value, has to be abandoned in the domain of microphysics. Hence from the viewpoint of philosophy of nature quantum mechanics has created a lot of deep open questions, in the domain of ontology as well as in the domain of epistemology. Does the concept of individuality pertain to microphysics, do the values of certain observables originate in the act of observation, how to speak about microcosmos with our concepts from mesocosmos? Some of these questions are examined by Heisenberg in his lecture Physics and Philosophy. The coincidence of quantum mechanics and of the successors like quantum electrodynamics with the observed values from observation is striking. But the interpretation of the mathematical framework is still discussed. The main challenge is to explain the transfer during the act of measuremen from the microcosmic world of possibilities to the mesocosmic world of definite results. The best explanation at hand is the mechanism of decoherence. Hence quantum mechanics provides us with an example of a theory which makes very precise predictions. But simultaneously, quantum mechanics provides a challenge for interpretation for each generation since its development at about 1925. 

Nietzsche introduces the last man in the prologue, chapter 5, of Nietzsche, Friedrich: Thus Spoke Zarathustra. See $URL$ Zarathustra came down from the mountains to give his first sermon about SUPERMAN. But the people in town do not show any reaction to his words. Hence Zarathustra appeals to their pride: 

How to interpret "it is possible that x is impossible"? As Paul Ross explains there is a certain calculus S5 of modal logic, i.e. a set of axioms and rules, where the two sentences "it is possible that x is impossible" and "x is impossible" are equivalent. Using the possible worlds interpretation one can interpret the result as follows: If in at least one world the sentence "x is impossible, i.e. false in all worlds" is true, then x is false in all worlds. 

According to this quote it was the "overcoming of morality by itself, through truthfulness". This was indeed Nietzsche's goal; e.g. see Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits (1878) and On the Genealogy of Morality: A Polemic (1887). But concerning the historical Zarathustra this ascription does not seem justified. 

When translating these logical relations into set theory, "Only A are B" translates into "The set of B's is a subset of the set of A's". I shall use the shorthand "B is a subset of A". On the other hand, "All A are B" translates into "A is a subset of B". ad 1: B is a subset of A and C is a subset of B implies C is a subset of A. Hence: Only A are C. ad 2: A is a subset of B and C is a subset of A implies C is a subset of B. Hence: All C are B. But herefrom you cannot conclude: Some C are B. Because C may be the empty set, i.e., there are no C's at all. But Some C are B means: At least one C is B. 

No, atheism is not just another form of dogma. Atheism is defined as a certain answer to a particular question. Namely the answer: No, there is no god. The term „atheism“ does not refer to the manner how one expresses this answer. While dogmatism is a certain manner how to express one‘s own answer to a given question. Expressing a position in a dogmatic way, i.e. as a dogma, means to state a thesis without taking seriously the objections of others. Of course, everywhere one finds persons who express their atheistic position in a dogmatic way. But there is no intrinsic relation between the position on one hand, and on the other hand the manner how one expresses this position. 

The role of +1 and -1 in mathematics is best understood when considering the set of integers including zero. Integers (Z,+,*) form a ring with respect to addition and multiplication. Integers have to distinguished elements: 

Quantum mechanics is a theory from physics, while Occam's Razor - see its wording from Philip Kloecking's answer - is a heuristic from the theory of science. As long as we do not have a better theory than quantum mechanics, the latter fits perfectly well to Occam's razor: There is no concurrent theory which explains at least as much as quantum theory, but employs less entities. Aside: Whether quantum mechanics is considered complex or simple depends on the background of the person in question. Nevertheless, the interpretation of quantum mechanics is still an open problem. 

Kant says that the noumenal is inconceivable, see "Chap. III Of the Ground of the Division of all Objects into Phenomena and Noumena" of his Critique of Pure Reason. He argues that we cannot know the raw material which lies before our information processing. We know the results of our information processing, but not its input. I think that's a clear and valid argument. 

But this question is totally open. Some would even argue that the question is meaningless because one cannot compare the two alternatives on a common ground. Hence one cannot speculate whether the question has a correct answer and what we could learn from that answer. 

No, there is no contradiction inherent to the concept of self-observation. Self-observation in the sense of your question means to convert as many unconscious processes as possible into conscious processes. That’s what Sigmund Freud tried to achieve by the means of psychoanalysis, e.g., by the interpretation of dreams. Self-observation is part of self-scrutiny. Oedipus in the Greek play Oedipus the King by Sophokles is driven by the demand to find out: Who am I? He follows the way of rational investigation to reach his goal. This approach includes learning and matching new information with the knowledge saved in one’s own memory. Also this approach is free from any logical contradictions. The term myself came into being as a simple reflexive pronoun: “I observe myself”. Language allows to reify the pronoun to a noun the Self. Soon the noun became charged with a family of mysterious meanings and became opposed to the subject in sentences like “I try to recognize my real (or true or higher or …) Self”. Here the person is split into two subjects, one is the I and the other the Self. This approach must challenge questions like “How shall I conceive these two subjects in one person?” The situation can be characterized by Wittgenstein’s remark 

For me the whole passage from Minima Moralia sounds a bit complaining. As if Adorno were not able to separate a thought from the context in which it is uttered. Being overwhelmed by the context makes it impossible for him to receive the pristine thought. 

Yes, we could: Take the universe itself as substance. The universe satisfies your definition as "the underlying being that supports, exists independently of, and persists through time despite changes in its accidental features". If you accept the hypothesis of a Big Bang, then there was no time before the existence of the universe. Spacetime is a feature of the universe.
