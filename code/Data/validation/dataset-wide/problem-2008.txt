Let’s be real, you will never have the best communication skills. Companies expect older staff to have better communication skills then someone that has just started off in life. Also your communication skills in interviews are likely to be less good then dealing with people that know you. However contractors are often only expected to have the best technical skills. Contracting also pays better, if you can cope with long commutes and/or working away from home. I found that found I had done a few interviews for contractor using my skill step, I could tell over 50% of the questions that would be asked before I went for the interview. You also only get asked questions about the single task they are going to pay you to do, not about “management” skills. 

It looks very good on your CV to have worked post university for a company you interned with, as it shows they must have liked you. Also you will need a reference from them for your next job move, so it is important to keep them on side. So be nice to them whatever you decide to do. On the other hand 15K is a lot of money! Personally I would go with company XXX and tell them about the other offer when you have your first salary review. If XXX is not willing to pay you what you think you are worth once you have 18 months experience, then consider other companies. Explain to company YYY that you have decided to take the offer from XXX as they provided you with an internship, but that it was a very hard to decide as you greatly respect company YYY. Email this to the person that interviewed you as well as the HR person. You want to be able to go back to company YYY in 18 months time if needed. 

(This answer is based on a student asking, it would not be the same if the person asking the question had lots of employment history in IT). You have learned skills (e.g. resolving disagreements, consistent commitment, clear writing etc) and shown leadership by being a moderator. Therefore as you had not had employment that you can use to demonstrate the same skills, you should list it on your CV. However explain the soft skills you used and gained by it and expect a question on it at interview. When faced with lots of CVs from students all listing the same courses with about the same grades, anything that makes a person stand out as being “more responsible” is likely to be look on positively. Unless you grades are bad, then it will be read that you could not control how you used your time. (Looking at some of your posts, you come across as polite, but a little “green behind the ears”, however that is not an issue as you are a student and I would not expect a student to show a high level of real world experience.) 

Next time you go for a job interview ask to see the office you will be working in, so you can judge for yourself before taking the job. Given my first sentence, you can see where this answer is going. If you talk to HR or your manager and it does not go well, you may get a bad reference saying you are a racialist; you are also very unlikely to get a positive outcome. The most you can risk saying is that you feel uncomfortable working with people that choose to speak in a language other than English in the office, as you don’t know what they are saying behind your back. I assume that opening in other teams are advertised, if so, you can trying making up a reason why you want the new job and applying for it. However you may just have to get a job with another company, and due to the reference issue, not say why you are leaving. And then the team is even less mixed, and the process repeats….. 

(I am assuming that no one will spend money on a holiday unless they have enough saving to be able to cope for a few months without work.) When the time comes, gives your boss two chooses…. 

Then decide what your employer has to do, to make you happy to remain in the job. But they are not going to move back to the old building. So consider options like remote working, flexitime, etc. Then talk to your bos in a “one to one” about it. However if you say you are unhappy in your job, you put yourself at the top of the list to be let go, if the company ever decides to downsize…. 

This is an issue in the UK. A fluent speaker can be expected to understand and communicate with other good speakers of English. But there are lots of people with poor English that can only communicate with someone that is a Native Speaker of the south of England, or talks like a Native Speaker of the south of England. It is the difference between dealing with members of the public (often on the phone) and dealing with a more limited number of people. So for example someone that has spoken “English” for all their life in the USA, may not have a good enough standard of English for some low paid jobs in the UK, but their standard of English would be OK for most high paid jobs. 

(In the first case, you then take legal advice, as at least in the UK your employer would have a legal case to answers.) Until the time comes just do you job without working any additional hours etc due to a miss placed feeling of guilt. 

This is only application to location where employee has lots of choose of jobs, that pay reasonably and that they are able to get. If IT is the only way someone will be able to afford food, then…. Most people do not enjoy doing a job if they. 

Since when have stopping a company losing some money be of that much importance? You have to find a better reason for the system to be fixed quickly and then interview for people that deeply care about that reason. You are looking for someone that thinks the customer is doing a worthwhile task and will feels a sense of ownership of the problem. Hopefully when the job is explained, most people that are not willing to do it will withdraw from the process. However some people will lose benefits, or have their family require them to take the first job they can get, or just be so fed up with their current job that they will take anything to get out. So ask the person lots of questions over at least 2 interviews spread out over at least 2 weeks about how they will cope practically with it – you don’t care what the answers are, just that you are making them think about it. Then only take on someone that loves their current job with a current job that does not pay much less. You are trying to select someone that has positively chosen to take your job. 

You are an intern, if they don’t like you or your work, they are likely to give you work they don’t care about and leave your in a corner. Unless you so something very bad, they will not go to the effort of telling you. But they will notice, and they will talk to each other about you…… Then when it comes time that you need a reference from them, the reference will not list what you have done wrong, but it will be less “glowing” then for someone they loved. Likewise if you every wish to get a job from them. Never leave right on the dot, as that will get notice, always work a few minutes longer then you have to. If you would rather work 9 to 17 ask your manager. However by getting in before other people, you can a chance to think about what you will be doing that day and have well thought out questions for when your boss gets in. You can also respond to emails before most people get into work, so the response is waiting for them, that makes you look like hard worker. But people will see you leaving before them and notice even when your contract allow is, they are likely to assume you got in 30 seconds before them when you get in early. Therefore a case can be made for requesting a change to your hours. 

It is common to get some of the junior staff to take the interviewee to a coffee shop for a break over lunch. This lets the interviewee ask them questions to get a better feel for the company, while letting the interview team discuss what they wish to ask the candidate next. It is also common that the interviewee will say something they would not have done so in the formal interview. Also it does no harm to show how nice the area round the office is... 

By automating the re-sizing, you will be spending less time actively looking at the image, thinking of the product it is going on etc. For example sometimes a image should be cropped before it is resized. I expect that some of the job can be automated and that a system can be put in place so that when an image is used on a product, the resized image is stored. But you will not know that until you have done the job for some time and understood what the real requirements are, not just the steps you have been told to do. 

It takes great skill and experience to create a system that other people can run without you. Likewise it is easy to write software, but hard to write software the other people can maintain. In the long term, anyone can be replaced regardless of their bus factor……. But it is a lot harder to find someone that can be depended on to have a high bus factor. So by making yourself easy to replace on your current projects, you are making yourself a lot harder to replace on upcoming projects. 

Start with collecting daily performance stats on how fast pizzas are delivered to customers, who delivered them and the times that each member of staff arrived and left. Even phone a few customers each evening to see if they are happy with the pizza and delivery. But do the same for all staff. Additional weekend hours should first be offered to drivers that have a record of working all their shifts correctly, along with drivers that are willing to cover for other drivers at short notice. Likewise if there is more than one driver ready to take a pizza out at the weekend, the driver with the best record should get to take it….. But this must all be done based on a set of formal rules and records that are crystal clear to everyone. The above could form part of a formal report given to the owner each month……. Then maybe ask the owner what he wishes you to do about drivers that are not keeping to their hours….. Also it is clear that drivers are not happy with the amount of money they make late at night on weekdays, maybe the owner will agree to a bonus for all drivers that correctly work all their weekday shifts. The owner's daughter maybe off to university soon, if so, this is a short term problem. 

There is often a rule that all candidates must be asked the same questions, this is so HR can prove that the process is fair. When this is the case, there is no point in the interviewer reading your CV, as it cannot change the questions they ask. 

At first sight it looks like there is a good legal case against the USA Company. However UK employment law gives very little protection to someone until they have been in a job for some time. Assuming the notice period on the employment offer was 1 month, the most you are likely to win from the company in a legal case is 1 month’s wages. (But you may get them to pay you 3 months wages, if they don’t wish their name to be all over the papers.) But trying to force a company outside of the UK to pay up, even when ordered by a UK court is expensive and likely to fail. Don’t sign a consultant contract with them in your personal name without getting very good legal advice! Tell them you will need to consult with a UK lawyer on your return to the UK before you agree to anything. Get them to pay ALL your expensive for the trip the USA cleared in your bank account, before rejecting any offer they make! If you create a limited company in the UK, and only sign any contracts in the company name you can protect yourself from most risks of them suing you. To cover the costs of running the company etc, expect to get “paid” double what you would in a “job”. Personally I would get as much compensation out of them as possible due to them misleading you about the job and you leaving your past job, then find some other work. Life is too short to a setup as complex as what they are trying to get you into. 

I would charge for all time working including time learning skills that are directly needed for the current project, likewise I would charge for all time in meetings and traveling to meetings. I would not stop charge when making a cup of tea or putting the washing in the dryer. I would not charge for time having lunch or doing the ironing. However I would give them something like 1hr free for each full day of work they pay for, to make up for the time I don’t have to spend commuting.
