Firstly, sin is generally considered to only be a category that applies to sapient beings: humans and angels/demons. But while animal homosexuality may not be sinful, God could consider it to be unnatural, or counter to his designs. A core concept of Judeo-Christian thinking is that the world we know has been holistically corrupted by sin. Humanity was created as a priviledged species, the "image of God", which both means that humanity is the most God-like of all created things, as well as indicating a role of being God's representatives on this earth. Whether sin has corrupted all things directly through the original human acts of sin because of those humans authority overt the world, or whether God more actively "cursed" the world, the result is that the world we know now is not the original perfect world of God's designs. An example of plant thorns is given in the scriptures: God is said to have changed plants after the fall of Man by making some of them produce thorns, as a consequence and punishment for sin. So they are both natural from our perspective and unnatural from the perspective of God's original design. But God is still seen to be in control, and it is accurate to say that God willfully makes plants with thorns. So within a Judeo-Christian perspective there is an inherent contradiction between what we observe as "natural" and what God would consider "natural". After sin "natural" has been changed. If God did consider animal homosexuality to be unnatural, it could be seen as one of the changes introduced by sin. In the same way, this makes the whole argument over whether human homosexuality is a matter of choice irrelevant. If human homosexuality has genetic causes, that doesn't tell us anything about whether it is part of God's original design, because it too could be an unnatural change like plant thorns. In my opinion then, debates (within Christianity) over morality of human sexuality shouldn't really be about what is "natural", for it doesn't really tell us anything. But demanding that it is a matter of choice to people who don't feel like they do have a choice is sure to very insensitive and hurtful to many. 

In the realm of philosophy, we'd have to consider it a possibility. So the answer, again, is of course. However, I'd quibble with the word "only." Another possibility might be that you and another individual have two separate, unique consciousnesses. But these individual consciousnesses can also be thought of as merging to form a bigger, super-consciousness. Are you familiar with the concept of cultural evolution? Evolution is normally thought of as an organic process that leads to the creation of new species. But people can use language, the media and computers to store and analyze their thoughts and memories. Generations of humans have continued to build on what previous generations learned, leading to what some call cultural evolution - sort of a global sharing of ideas. To put it another way, imagine if you could travel back in time 50,000 years and tell a "cave man" that killing another human is immoral. Who's he going to listen to - one time traveler or his clan members and every other cave man on the planet? It took literally hundreds and thousands of years for the concept of murder to take root and become globally accepted as a moral tenet. Even today, individuals have different opinions regarding murder, the death penalty, war, etc. However, the global consciousness clearly has a different view of killing than previous generations did. Of course, one might ask if the "global consciousness," or shared learning, I'm referring to is really consciousness...is it the same type of consciousness you're referring to? It would be very helpful if we knew of an intelligent race from a distant galaxy. Would they also manifest cultural evolution? Would they have a sort of "global consciousness" that could be compared to ours? And could intelligent races from different worlds somehow pool their thoughts and memories to create an even bigger consciousness? EDIT P.S. On the subject of connection, let's assume that things like mental telepathy, clairvoyance, etc. are all fiction. Obviously, there's no PHYSICAL connection between people's brains. But so what? Think about a computer paired with a wireless device. There's no physical connection there, yet information can clearly be transmitted between different devices. Do people not transmit information and ideas through their words and actions? Every time a person smiles, they're conveying information. Again, a lot depends on how you define "consciousness," but I have no problem envisioning the human race as 7.6 billion two-legged neurons connected together via their senses as well as shared languages. One might even envision animals and possibly plants as part of this consciousness. Has domestic dog behavior not evolved over time? Is it not closely tied to human behavior? Do dogs sense how humans are feeling or what they're thinking? 

In deductive logic, we may make the following step: ( {Γ,P}⊨Q & {Γ,P}⊨¬Q ) ⇒ {Γ}⊨¬P I've been trying to find examples of a proof that this inference follows, but I've struggled with my search. If anyone could point me in the right direction, or show me the proof, it would be much appreciated. I would be particularly interested in a proof that doesn't use a deduction theorem to prove that a reductio as a logically permissible inferential step. 

A set of sentences can be shown to truth-functionally entail the conclusion so long as there does not exist a model capable of satisfying the premises whilst the confusion fails to obtain. This proof of truth-functional entailment (⊨) is distinct from the deductive entailment (⊢) which might standardly be used in a derivation. 

This is more of a political question than philosophical. Democracy and dictatorship are polar opposites. A democracy is a state that's governed by the people, while a dictatorship is ruled by just one individual. There are many shades of gray in between. The U.S. calls itself a democracy but is actually an oligarchy - a state governed by a relatively small number of powerful people. Communism is essentially an economic system in which the government owns the means of production, making it a form of government as well. It's an extreme form of socialism. Joseph Stalin and Fidel Castro could both be loosely described as communist dictators, but they were as different as night and day. There have been a number of socialist/communist states, and judging their success is as difficult as judging the "success" of socialist states. As Castro said, "Where is the success of capitalism in Africa, Asia and Latin America?" Much of the "success" in the U.S. is more accurately described as exploitation and crime. Almost any state that embraces socialism will come under attack by the U.S. and its allies, and the major weapons now used include internal destabilization. That's a major reason why there don't appear to be many successful communist states. On the other hand, there are more homeless people in "progressive" Seattle than all of Cuba, and socialist Libya was Africa's brightest star. Which isn't to say that communism is the BEST answer. Many people, myself included, are more enamored of a so-called "mixed economy" combining capitalism and socialism. The so-called "pink tide" that gripped Latin America so recently is a fabulous examples. They were making great progress, but now the revolution has been turned upside down by foreign meddling, including sabotaging Argentina's economy. It's very difficult to make accurate comparisons between capitalism and socialism because of the endless games, not to mention an ocean of propaganda. 

One thought is that death is a lack of experience. In trying to experience non-experience, we destroy the lack of phenomenon so we cannot truly experience non-experience; that is, experiencing non-experience is impossible because to experience anything is immediately not non-experience. I know this section is less related to your original question about nominalism, but I feel it is relevant to the sentence quoted above. Hopefully it leads you down some new and interesting lines of thought. 

A formal system is expressively complete if and only if it is capable of expressing, as a formula, everything that is the subject of that formal system. A deductive system is semantically complete if and only if every sentence that is truth-functionally entailed by a set of sentences can be derived from that set. Is there a relation between these two types of completeness? If the two are related, what type of relation is this? 

In the realm of philosophy, it seems like just about anything is possible. So I would say we can't know the world wasn't created just five minutes ago. But by the same token, we could argue that the world might have been created SEVEN minutes ago or thirteen years in the future. Or maybe there is no world at all. If you're going to accept one "flaky" theory, you kind of have to accept them all. And if we discovered that the world was indeed created just five minutes ago, it would blow a hole in just about everything we think we know. So why waste time on such absurd propositions? Of course, I'm just tap dancing around your question. In the end, I have to rely on my mind, logic, scientific evidence, etc. For example, saber mentioned radiocarbon dating, which is a good point. But if we're going to dive back into anything-goes-philosophy, then we might argue that some kind of god created the universe five minutes ago - and she created things that appear to be much older. Again, we're stuck in a circular argument. In the end, I have to confess that I can't be 100% certain of anything. But I'm going to use my mind as a guide, because without it I'd be even more hopelessly lost. History, radiocarbon dating and the speed of light work for me. 

I must not be understanding what you're saying, because this makes no sense at all. Is World War II too limited in time to be true? Is Vatican City too limited in space to be true? Of course not. Historical events take place in time and space in exactly how much time and space they take. The central claim of Christianity is a historical one: that a man, Jesus of Nazareth, was God incarnate, who lived in Judea, died, and rose again. It is inherent to this belief, that God became a true human person, that Jesus is limited to that time and place. That claim can be evaluated for its historicity (at least to the extent of whether such a man existed and died). 

It may depend on how you define both probability and possibility. If you define them in a similar framework. For example, a thing has 0.2 probability if it is the case in 20% of all possible world*. A thing is possible if there is at least one possible world where it is the case. Then, to say that an event has a probability of 0 would be to say that there does not exist a possible world such that the event occurs in that world. This would thereby deny the possibility of that event at all. *These conclusions don't depend on a sort of Modal Realism, but I'm merely using the possible worlds as a useful fiction for the purposes of explanation. 

That isn't true. Many people never have children, either because they don't want children or they're biologically unable to reproduce. In biological terms, suicide is an aberration, because it's unknown in any species save our own. In that spirit, you might intuitively postulate that committing suicide is not a good thing to do. But with a global population of seven billion, an individual's value as a replicator is questionable. Ironically, some have joked that suicide is the best thing one can do for the planet. Check out the Church of Euthanasia. I'm not saying I agree with this dark humor. If you're smart enough to be aware of the problems confronting our species and one of those very rare people who actually care, then you're worth far more alive than dead. 

Not necessarily, it depends on how you define each of the words. Let us take three distinct cases and tease out how their definitions determine what classes as having those properties. An entity may class as having the property of being a "Can-Opener" if it plays the functional-role of opening cans. You put in a closed can, you get out an opened can, and so long as the entity can fulfil that role, it is a can-opener. Bear in mind the use of can fulfil that role; a thing need not have ever opened a can for it to classify as a can opener, so long as it bears the disposition to do so given that the right conditions occur (i.e. A can is put between its teeth and the process performed). On the other hand, an entity classes as having the property of being a "murderer" if it has (I suppose, deliberately) taken a life. Differently to the can-opener, this entity only classes as a murderer given that it has taken a life, whilst a thing may be a can-opener despite never having opened a can, but by simply bearing the disposition to do so. To clarify, classing as a murder requires that the entity has performed the specific task required to class as a murder, namely, the act of murdering. If we consider being stupid, which of these types definitions fits "being stupid" (bear in mind, there are many others available, but for now let us consider only these two). I am inclined to say that "being stupid" is defined as a disposition to act stupidly (given the right conditions), in a similar way to have we defined the can opener as having the disposition to perform a certain function. Say that we have the same conditions twice, and in one case, a person does something stupid, and in the other case, they do not, then it does not seem as though they truly have the disposition to at stupidly, so we might say that they do not class as "stupid". Alternatively, if one appears to regularly display acts of stupidity, then it may be enough to suggest that have a disposition to act stupidly, and thus potentially class as stupid. So, perhaps we should say that a single act of stupidity may not be enough for one to class as stupid, but perhaps after a number of stupid actions, it may be sufficient to suggest that they have a dispositon to act stupidly, and thus we may class them as stupid.
