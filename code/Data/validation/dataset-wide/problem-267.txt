Yes, and you can do it even in a world where people create gunpowder and recognize its usefulness. In fact, your world should naturally evolve that way. The existence of your type of magic gives military technology reason to prioritize projectile defense over melee defense, and this would only increase the more prevalent and powerful magic is, since your magic lends itself towards projectile attacks. Why would you wear expensive, bulky plate armor when your enemy can just shoot a metal spike through you from a mile away? No, you need something that conceals or can deflect projectiles, not something that makes you highly visible and slower. How does anti-projectile armor make it so people don't use gunpowder in war? You may already have guessed, but let's examine why Europe adopted guns to find out more. Guns started really showing up in Europe in the late 15th century. Here's what armor looked like scroll down to look at cavalry at that time. You may notice that these heavy knights look almost invincible. That's because they darn near were invincible, only succumbing to specialized weaponry or after being knocked to the ground, and trying to do that was a good way to get yourself killed. That armor is the reason that guns were adopted. Guns were the only weapon that could take down these heavy knights reliably and at a distance (period crossbows were not sufficient to penetrate quality plate). The single, crucial advantage of armor penetration compensated for the slow rate of fire, cumbersome nature, and expense of gunpowder weaponry. Without that initial advantage, guns will never be adopted at all and so will not advance to become useful - at least, not for thousands of years. And now you're about to say something about cannons - cannons are fine. OP explicitly stated that their goal is to keep "swords, shields, pikes and heavy cavalry" as viable options on the battlefield. Cannons don't replace those things, so we're in the clear. 

I personally prefer having they in front of me, physically. So I'd recommend writing/typing out brief explanations of your concepts. Just a few lines each, that can fit on a piece of card/paper maybe the size of your hand. One concept per card. Print them out and arrange them in front of you (maybe 10 cards per row, work your way from left to right, and downwards), then when you're happy with the arrangement, number them in pencil. Maybe best to worst, or in chronological order, etc. So it's easier if you need to move things around in future, then you can just change the numbers. This way, after you're done arranging and numbering, you can just sweep them up and keep them in a stack, without worrying about forgetting the order. As you formulate your ideas, go through the concepts one by one. 

Separate future-Brooklyn from now-Brooklyn. If the two Brooklyns are together, and someone asked future-Brooklyn a question, now-Brooklyn would also hear it, and she would subconsciously think of the answer. Since future-Brooklyn is suspected to be telepathic, she would be able to hear the answer in now-Brooklyn's head and say it. So, put now-Brooklyn somewhere else, where she wouldn't even hear it if future-Brooklyn were shouting at the top of her lungs. If it's impossible to physically separate them, give now-Brooklyn a pair of headphones and tell her to watch TV/listen to music while staring at the wall, or just knock her unconscious for a while. Just make sure she has no way of knowing what questions future-Brooklyn is being asked. Have both Amanda and Brian collaborate to ask future-Brooklyn questions that neither of them know the answer to, and those questions have to be factual. Nomatter how far you travel, how old you are, or how many things you've experienced, the answer cannot change, and both Amanda and Brian cannot know the answer. For example: During vacation when you were 10 years old (assuming now-Brooklyn is about 15), what colour was your toothbrush at your hotel? She wouldn't have considered it necessary to share that information with anyone, and the toothbrush will remain the same colour in her memories, nomatter what. Or What was the last thing you said to your mother and/or father when you last saw her/him/them? It would be personal enough that she wouldn't have shared it with anyone, and apart from slight forgetfulness, her feelings, opinions, beliefs and experiences would not have changed the fact. By the way, future-Brooklyn would have to answer the questions truthfully. 20+ questions should be enough. Amanda and Brian, not knowing if the answers are right or wrong, would have to write them all down. But they must not let now-Brooklyn see the questions or the answers. Let now-Brooklyn back into the picture, with absolutely no idea what questions were asked and what was answered. Amanda and Brian will ask now-Brooklyn the exact same questions, in the exact same order, etc. And still do not let her see future-Brooklyn's answers: you do not want her to be influenced by what she sees written down. Now-Brooklyn also has to answer truthfully, and Amanda and Brian can check her answers with future-Brooklyn's answers. Cross-reference the answers. If both Brookylns gave the same answers to most (well, actually, should be all) of the questions, then you know that future-Brooklyn is legitimate. If there is a large discrepancy, or if it looks like future-Brooklyn was guessing, you know she's a phony. 

Historially, the weakness of mountain pass defenders is the fact that their own country and allies neglect to reinforce and resupply them or the enemy goes around them. Since you are surrounded by mountains and appear to be quite stable and dedicated, these weaknesses are not yours. 

Okay, so that gets the biggest lethal stuff out of the way. Now let's focus on quality of life while you're still living. 

Finally, the true weakness is the time-stopping itself. You just have to go backwards in time to kill him. His defense will render him completely blind to an attack from the future, since the time-stopping will prevent the attack from even existing until his shield disengages. (The simplest would be a magical bomb that detonates backwards in time.) 

The goal here is to create a society where people mostly just die of old age, don't get mental illness, and live very healthily for most of their lives. I recognize that this would create some weird social dynamics (like where STD people get ostracized like crazy or where people with bad genetics are social pariahs.) Those should be (relatively) short-lived. 

Easily accessible by both superpowers You've already answered your question. If both superpowers can easily access the island, then either superpower can easily destroy any installation that the other creates. Therefore, assuming that neither side is ruled by complete idiots, nobody is going to waste the resources to try and build anything on this island, since it'll just get blown up or blockaded or otherwise rendered useless. Now, this alone doesn't 100% explain why they wouldn't both at least claim the island. Belligerent states do tend to lay claim to everything. So, we have to take into consideration reputation and assume that neither side currently claims it. Given these two things, if either side decided to lay claim to the island, then the other superpower could prevent the construction of any installations and then just waltz in for a photo shoot every month or so. "Ooooh, look at the mighty superpower. Can't even defend one lousy island from our 'elite' photographers, ooooh." It works better if you use really wimpy-looking photographers and include their picture in the press release. It's just too easy for one superpower to punish any move by the other on this island. The main character isn't affected by this, since (I assume) he/she/it is not at war with either superpower. As to why the superpowers ignore him/her/it, do elephants go out of their way to squash caterpillars? 

The good thing about it is that it makes all future-Brooklyn's powers completely redundant. Speed and power mimicking would not help her here. And, if she really were a telepath, there would be nothing useful to pick up in other people's minds, because neither of them would be thinking of the answers. Amanda and Brian would not know the answers, and now-Brooklyn would not even hear the questions, until after future-Brooklyn has already given all her answers. By then, it's too late to change her answers if she realises it was wrong. Also, by asking factual questions, it would not matter how old either of them were or what happened to future-Brooklyn in those 5 years. For example, if you were to ask a opinion question, like If you were to see your first, most beloved pet, Jack the dog, would you be happy or sad?, now-Brooklyn might say she would be happy, because she loved that dog. But future-Brooklyn may have let's say watched her friend get viciously attacked and eaten by a dog during those 5 years. Though the memory would have been suppressed, subconsciously, she would have developed a phobia of dogs, without knowing why right now. So she might say, she'd be frightened, cos she's scared of dogs. And this would cause errors in the cross-referencing of answers, unlike the factual questions above. Nomatter what happened to you, if your toothbrush was blue, you will always remember it to be blue. 

Tl;dr - Bad idea, with serious health risks and repurcussions, plus additional equipment expense/risk. Both people and electronics operate better in air than in water. 

Gunpowder - primitive grenades, land mines, and breach-loading rifles would have a huge impact. If the metallurgy is too primitive to make rifles, then muskets could be fine - I imagine you could make some that were at least as fast to load as a crossbow and with more penetrating power. Navigation - an accurate clock and knowledge of global trade winds would enable you to navigate in the open ocean on long voyages, granting your navy a HUGE advantage. Also, make sure to bring back some basic techniques for how to make ships more seaworthy in general. Reliable shipping and the ability to cross oceans would be quite valuable and would enable surprise strikes deep in enemy waters. Food preservation and knowledge of basic nutrition/sanitation. Medieval armies were often forced to fight during a very limited campaign season. Knowing some of these basics would enable your army to campaign when your enemies cannot. Nationalism. A time traveler would know some of what's required to inspire a population with nationalistic sentiment. This sentiment can be used simultaneously to improve army morale and decrease the power of the nobility, removing two major weaknesses of a Medieval kingdom (hard to campaign regularly if the people or nobility revolt) Guerilla and commando tactics. With your advances in gunpowder and the loyalty inspired by nationalism, you can create elite commando units to operate deep in enemy lines, disrupting supply lines and destroying small, key outposts. Yes, that may have already existed, but you can take it to the next level. Child care and sanitation. Guess what you need to fight a war? People. Guess what you get a lot of if you cut the infant mortality rate in half? People. Social norms change pretty slowly, so you should get a generation or two with WAAAAY more people than you really need. Welcome, recruits, to the glorious army of the empire!!! The mentality of total war. A lot of medieval wars seem like children squabbling - people fight a whole year to snag a few miles of crapland and some ransoms. No, this time, we burn half their country to the ground and slay every male noble we can find. They try to invade? We scorch the earth, burn bridges, poison their supplies, booby trap the roads, and harass them from every side before annihilating their entire army. No ransoms, no survivors, no grudges to hold, since nobody is left to hold them. 

The main reason I can think of is that the aliens realise that they have certain drawbacks that prevent them from accomplishing their purpose/mission on Earth. With selective genetics, they could create an alien-human hybrid that possesses the strengths of the alien and also of the human. That way, if they want to colonize/take over the world, they have the perfect species to do so: a hybrid that maybe looks and behaves like a human and can survive in Earth's atmosphere, and yet is subject to the group mindset and follows the bidding of the pure aliens. The above scenario could be if aliens are new to the world and thus have (perhaps) sinister motives. Alternatively, in a Star Wars environment, where aliens are already an accepted part of life, such a hybrid could solve the problem of boundaries and citizenship. For example, in current climes, if a German father married an Asian mother, their children could possibly be citizens of either country. Thus, the same concept could be applied with respect to aliens, where the aliens would then strengthen their footing on Earth. 

One solution could be to build enclosed mass cities for all humanity, and whatever flora and fauna we can save. Since the disaster has been predicted and has not taken place yet, the time remaining to humans (hopefully a couple decades before the disaster) could be spent collecting all manner of flora and fauna, and putting them in a protected, sealed environment. It may be possible to artificially create an atmosphere in such a city, through chemical reactions, and biological processes. Food, water, supplies, etc. could also be stockpiled up, but contingency plans must be put into place, so humans can learn how to build on these resources: re-learn how to make materials needed in an artificial atmosphere. With the right regulations, such a civilisation could possibly exist for a while. The main problems would be the extremely high cost of building such massive cities, not to mention the time required to stockpile resources and conduct research and experiments on how to regulate the atmosphere and environment in the cities. The humanity problem would be how to decide who gets to live in the cities, and who dies outside, unless you could build cities big enough for all humanity. But other than that, basically, we're all living in bubbles in the middle of a ruined earth. Eventual relocation to space may be a consideration. Or you could just wait for the atmosphere to 'reboot', if that's possible. 

Option 1: The only functional fusion reactor in the world is at the center of that city, and there is little to no hope of ever building a different one (although the current one could be repaired from almost any damage.) Why this works: In the near-future, we can assume that power is the greatest resource requirement of civilization. Furthermore, the infrastructure required to transmit such an awesome amount of power is incredibly expensive and becomes more and more inefficient the farther you go. Therefore, humanity bunches up around this energy source. Additional Details: Power alone won't be sufficient to overcome humanity's drive towards expansion, so we'll need something else to force us to bunch up. Carrot - maybe there is some energy field discovered that dramatically improves human health, but you have to be constantly in the field and it's incredibly energy-hungry. Stick - maybe there is some really nasty radiation coming in and only a very energy-hungry shield can stop it. Option 2: Total zombie/demonic/alien/whatever apocalypse. Why this works: The loners and splinter groups just keep getting wiped out before they can ever gain traction, so only the main city continues to survive. It's not that there aren't other cities, just that none of them ever last more than a few years before succumbing to the zombies/aliens/sapient apes. 

Have you heard of the Stung Series? Where almost everything dies out because of a 'bee flu'? Might be useful. Of course, in that case, you have normal humans and infected 'beast-like' humans, and not absolutely everything was wiped out... But the fundamentals might be the same. In the case where completely all other flora and fauna are gone, there may be other problems than simply cannibalism. First, malnutrition and disease, because human meat, like other animal meat, contains mainly protein, and may not contain the minerals, vitamins and plant-based fibers needed for proper digestion, etc. You know how constipated you get if you don't eat enough fruits & veggies? Well, imagine that, multiplied by like a billion. Plus, the vitamins that help us from getting sick primarily come from plants. I don't know currently if there are any other sources of such fibers and vitamins for humans, but if we have to resort to eating each other, then we'll have widespread bowel problems and most of us would be unable to repel even simple illnesses. Second, 'animalisation' of the weaker/less fortunate humans. Cockfighting and Dog Fighting are examples of how humans currently use animals to satisfy their violent urges. If animals were to be taken from us, it is likely that the weaker/less fortunate humans would end up in rings, forced to fight against one another, like the old gladiator times. Third, unbalanced populations. Most females have monthly visitors that are excruiciating and debilitating. Another side to this is that women lose vitamins, and other essential nutrients much faster than men, simply because they lose blood every month. It is a contributing factor to why women get arthritis more than men in old age: because they keep losing nutrients like calcium every month. Thus, women would fall sick and die more than men in this dystopia, causing population problems. Women become a valuable resource: almost like an extinct species, and you'd have more cases of women being kept simply for sex. Not to mention procreation problems. Fourth, environment and climate changes, and in the extreme, complete suffocation of the earth. Plants are Earth's lungs. Without them, we'd soon run out of oxygen. I suppose humans could be kept in giant sealed cities, where oxygen can be produced in limited quantities using chemical reactions. But then that means everything outside those cities would be completely inhabitable. The list goes on... Another probable case study could be Snowpiercer, where practically everything outside of a controlled environment is dead, and people in the lower orders do turn to cannibalism when desperate. Governance is definitely a problem, where the heros of the story rebel against the authorities. No need to wait for a decline of power. 

Your skin will pretty much start disintegrating You'd have to make every tool that the crew used water-tight or non-electrical, and wiring failures could be catastrophic. 

Perhaps because they can molt? If this long-lived species molts every ~5 years, then it would be a perfect way of removing anything but extreme scarring. Perhaps severe cases might require multiple molts. The molting could even be a factor in their longevity. Also, they can regrow limbs while in the molting stage. Cover up the scars by giving them exotic joint structures that mask the appearance of the scarring there. So, a limbless member of this species would just deal with it for a few years and then, right before their next molt, rip off the remainder of the limb they wanted to regenerate. Wait a few weeks and voila! Shiny new arm! If all members of the species only had visible scarring if it had occurred within the last 5 to 10 years, then there really wouldn't be much scarring to see. I can't speak too much for psychological traumas, but I see two key possibilities for dealing with those. 

If there's anything that humans are good at, it's deforestation on colossal scale. The hard part is getting humans to not deforest a region. Worst-case, assuming this super-forest is supernaturally tough and resistant to all known herbicides and fire, just drop your spaceship on them. Atmospheric re-entry heat and pressure should be more than sufficient to clear space.
