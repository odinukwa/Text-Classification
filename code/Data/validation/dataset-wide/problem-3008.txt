He would not approve of my use of the word 'optical-illusion' in the description, so I don't mean to smuggle in the naturalist interpretation, I am just giving the easiest way to remind you of the phenomena. I think the Rotating Snakes would be a fine and easier to see example of the sort he meant. 

So if, "John has black hair" is a singular (and thus, scientific?) statement and "There exists a man that has black hair" is a logical deduction from the statement, but also purely existential and thus metaphysical. Does this mean that Popper allows logical inference to turn scientific statements into metaphysical ones? Or are singular statements not scientific according to Popper's demarcation? 

Sources and further information: [1] In his typically colourful language he writes (on pg. 245-6 of 2010 reprint of Against Method): 

I would agree with Feyerabend that the statement [A] doesn't achieve anything except introduce an extra judgement statement, but statement [B] (which is what I think most people mean) separates two domains of 'appearance' and 'reality' and thus is not contradictory. Question Feyerabend spends a lot of time talking about appearance and reality elsewhere, so I am worried that maybe I am missing some subtlety that makes statement [B] contradictory. Am I missing some subtlety in Feyerabend's critique of self-consistency? Alternatively, if this particular argument is so weak then it seems like for such a bold claim he would support it more elsewhere. Are there other articles where Feyerabend (or subsequent authors) more closely defends his critique of self-consistency? Alternatively, are there more convincing examples of the failure of self-consistency? 

After translating the works, it seems that Ficino commented on several dialogues like Parmenides, Sophist, Philebus, Timaeus, Phaedrus and (only) part of the Republic (the confusing numerology from 546a-e). Although he also uses some imagery from the Republic, like the cave, it seems to be mostly coming through engaging with Plotinus and not Plato's Republic directly. It would seem that the Republic was at-least mildly important for the ancients, given that people like Zeno (founder of Stoicism) wrote book-length responses. However, I don't know how much response other dialogues by Plato had garnered, so this is not convincing evidence for me. I am not as interested in if the work was actually influential or widely read, but if it was considered to be influential and widely read. However, knowledge of the first can inform the second. I've asked this question on /r/askphilosophy and /r/askhistory and although they were well received by votes, those threads have not generated any answers or insights. 

Apparently, Russell and Dewey had a very provocative debate in the philosophical literature of their time. Unfortunately I am only familiar with Russell's side of the debate, and want to learn more about Dewey's responses. In his Logic: the Theory of Inquiry, Dewey side-lines truth (only mentioning it in the context of Peirce's definition once in a footnote) and focuses on inquiry, which he defines as: 

I frankly think Mauro's answer is, if not wrong, then at least misleading. I think the set theory part of it is mostly fine (but irrelevant the OP's question), but I very strongly disagree with the idea that sets are merely special kinds of collections: rather, each set gives rise to the collection of its elements, but the set is not the collection and the collection is not the set. On the other hand, I think his analysis of what variables are is very misleading and possibly outright wrong. 

My actual position would be that the whole symbol discussion is a red-herring: variables are a concept auxiliary to the concepts of substitution and hypotheticals; variables are a part of language (hence symbolic in the sense of the given answers) only insofar as concepts are expressed and possibly learned in language. 

First, the meaning of a statement is not its truth value. Obviously whether the natural language sentence "it is red" is meaningful does not depend on whether the thing referred to by "it" is actually red. Similarly, a mathematical formula with a free variable like "x is red" can be meaningful even though it does not (and cannot) have a truth value (only propositions, i.e. formulas without free variables, can have truth values, although undecidable propositions also don't have truth values but are still meaningful). Whether "x is red" is meaningful depends on whether the type of x supports redness as a property it may or may not posses. This runs somewhat counter to the usual formulation of first-order logic that mathematicians use, in which formulas with free-variables are only auxiliary constructs on the way to formulating propositions, that is, formulas with no free variables, which are always meaningful and can be true or false when given semantics in the sense of model theory. However, ascribing such an auxiliary status to formulas with free variables is merely a mathematical convention, not a philosophical position. In particular, in other formal languages, like type theory or fragments of first-order logic, assertions with free variables play a fundamental role and must be considered meaningful for the mathematics to even get of the ground. Second, a statement with pronouns is only meaningful if the pronoun has a(n implicitly or explicitly) specified referent. Reference is the fundamental grammatical function of pronouns. Variables, on the other hand, do not have referents, they do not refer. To suggest that variables are like pronouns may misleadingly encourage the misconception that variables are the same thing as "unknowns" â€“ they are not. Rather, they key function of variables (in logic, not programming) is not that they refer, but that they can be substituted for by other expressions (of the same type as the type of the variable). Thus, the "x" in the statement "x is red" can be substituted for by any expression of the same type as "x", to produce a new statement. This natural language example is a bit difficult to deal with, because the type of "x" is unspecified, hence is implicitly everything. This means that I can substitute anything for "x", e.g. "horse" for "x", or "unicorn", or "banana", or "two", or "Mauro" to get various other statements: "unicorn is red", "horse is red", "banana is red", "two is red", "Mauro is red". 

Background Many physicists use 'reality cannot have a true paradox, only apparent ones in our theory' as a very common maximum and guide to theory checking. As with all universal rules, Paul Feyerabend disagrees[1] that this is useful rule across science, and suggests that there are facts that are best described by inconsistent theories. Unfortunately he only gives one such example[2]: optical illusions where a static object appears to be moving. He asserts that "[t]he only phenomenologically adequate description is 'it moves, in space, but it does not change place'". In a footnote (ft 92, ch 16) Feyerabend tries to address the obvious criticism (raised to him by A.J Ayer and G.E.L. Owen) that the above statement deals with appearances by saying that putting "it appears to move" in front of the statement just pushes the question to the level of appearences but doesn't resolve it. However, it seems to me that Feyerabend is completely missing the point, because he is assuming that we are saying (with glorious use of brackets added by me) that: 

In his review of Dewey's book, Russell satirizes this definition by pointing out that it is met by a "drill-sergeant in transforming a collection of raw recruits into a regiment", or a "bricklayer transforming a heap of bricks into a house". How did Dewey respond to these critiques? Does Dewey view the work of the drill-sergeant or bricklayer as inquiry? If so, then how do these seemingly physical tasks relate to a theory of logic? If not, then how did he refine his definition? If Dewey did not refine his definition, did subsequent pragmatists offer a response to Russell's critique? 

Today, the Republic is often considered to be Plato's best known and most influential work. Some even consider it as one of the best known and most influential works of all of philosophy; at least it is a contender for this populist view. However, during the Medieval ages, it was largely lost to Western Europe, and part of the Timaeus was the only Platonic work available before the 12th century (when the Meno and the Phaedo were translated, but not widely read). Except for this, Plato's works were unavailable to the Latindom until the Renaissance when Marsilio Ficino translated the complete works of Plato in the late 15th century (see also note [1]). When they re-emerged, did the Republic become Plato's most popular work right away, or is that a more recent development? How long was it until it could be considered a contender in the public's eye or among philosophers as one of the most influential or famous works of philosophy? Finally, I put "(re-)" in the title, is that appropriate? Was the Republic considered to be Plato's most popular work in antiquity (say during the Hellenistic period, when many schools formed as descendants of Socrates as told by Plato; see note [2]), or did the ancients prefer a different text of his?
