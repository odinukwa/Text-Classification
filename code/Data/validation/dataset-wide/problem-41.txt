This question becomes impossible to answer without knowing many other variables such as the rate of consumption, mean time between food discovery, speed of blob, and specific details about the local ecology. The best bet is to maximize surface area by stretching into a pancake like object for the highest food collection rate. *C stands for organically bound carbon or carbon being used in a living system. 

Companies can adopt a reputation scheme as follows. Near the start-up, companies will strive to produce the best product their resources will allow, squeezing every last ounce of quality into them. Meanwhile, messengers are sent all around the known world spreading news about the "amazing X company" and of course provide accessibility to the products. If the company manages to catch on, their fame will rapidly skyrocket their product quality, but in turn they wont need to even try to improve any further. Companies will gain undefeatable monopolies. 

Specifically, what is the exact principle that allows a rain dance to work, but not magical pumpkins. Certainly rain is more plausible, but unless magic is a sentient being capable of understanding plausibility... 

There's a particular type of civilisation fairly common in fantastic worlds that broadly meet the following criteria: 

Given the definitions you've provided the only real difference is that in one the leaders are in place for life, while in the other the leaders are only in place for a term or two, based on votes. With that in mind there's one rather crucial disadvantage an autocratic society has: it's bad at dealing with particularly bad leaders. In a democracy, if you don't like the Prez, you can just wait 3-4 years and vote them out of office. Impeach them, if you're impatient. Bring in a new Prez, maybe they'll do better. In an autocracy, if Le Roi is a fool, you can either starve while he runs amuck eating cake for 50-odd years, or, well, I suppose you could burn the regime down and invite a whole lot of people to meet Madame Guillotine. This is... less than ideal for the advancement of science. We can only speculate how much was lost when Antoine Lavoisier had his head lopped off. In reality we're never going to get a good leader 100% of the time. For every Sun King there's a Louis XVI, and for an absolute leader, their failure is absolute. 

To begin with the gods of both Islam-esque and Christianity-esque in my story are just super humanoid beings with semi-immortality(They won't die but can be killed) but they already died including all their offsprings that would have taken their place. All thats left are their super advance technologies(The 'gods' were in fact the last 2 of their super advanced civilization). Come 500 years after they died the religion that they established is still going strong with Crusades and Jihads dividing the world in half. The world has magic(a mutation from the god like humanoid beings) The good thing about the crusades and jihad is that because the whole world is split in two and its might makes right rule in most areas, the roads are fully developed, there are industries capable of of supporting the armies of both sides on a massive scale. But also the population is always culled due to the crusades and jihad so suffering and poverty in most war torn places runs rampant but the inner territories of both sides flourishes due to its distance from war zone. The difference between the rich and poor is so large that the fear of rebellion can be realize once the crusades and jihad ends Now you come to the story as someone from modern day earth and see the world divided in to two, just that this world is ripe of strife and suffering. Being the good person you are, you want to put a stop to it. The only probable way to do it is to create a religion to false gods. Upon stumbling on their hidden cache of technologies you are only able to use 3 things atm. 

Wikipedia ballparks earth's total biomass at 560 billion tons C*. If the blobs are able to consume all life, given a rough estimate of bacterial volume/weight (0.6um3/picogram) lands a rough mass at. The volume of the Mediterranean Sea (I am skeptical about this answer and open to revisions) 

I see these happening automatically given the wide range of opinions on nearly everything, except the last one. Unless abilities are one-in-a-million and relatively new, they will just be a common part of culture. Heritability would stimulate group associations, and stereotyping would further that, however, the most surefire way to implement associations is most likely geographic ability distribution. Some kind of landmark or location bestows abilities in a small radius around itself, whether it covers a town or a country, leads settlers to gradually become affected by -insert ability here-. The fast way: Take a stock super-power, but then add in a caveat that (usually) blows the helping half out of the water. More examples: Subject can quickly understand anything read, but is plagued with short term memory loss, rendering new knowledge generally useless. Shape-shifting normally causes death in the infant stage as it transforms users into their mental images (including non-sentient ones). Some, usually mentally damaged to impair visualization, can eventually grasp the ability, but the risk still remains. 

The best reason to have human pilots, when the factions are roughly equivalent? You're trying to counter the remote drones. ECT has already gone all-in on drones, the answer isn't necessarily to switch to drones and try to catch up - ECT will have the advantage having already retooled their factories and refined their drone designs. (It could be the answer but that spoils the premise) Instead, SEDA takes advantage of the inherent need for a drone to have a remote link. Missiles packed with radio-interfering chaff. High tech electronic warfare suites. EMP missiles. A manned fighter can shield against this - a remote drone can't shield its antenna(e) For SEDA, manned fighters are the best option. They can fully EMP shield their own fighters then jam as loudly as they please, knowing their own fighters will be less affected and thus gain the advantage in a given battle.* There are a number of other smaller advantages (like reaction time being necessarily shorter being in the plane vs being 1000km away in a bunker, cheaper sensors in the form of the pilot, drones vulnerable to decapitation strike in remote facility) and disadvantages (a drone pilot survives their plane exploding) but how exactly those stack up and balance out in the end is up to you. *I discount here effective AI driven piloting as a major factor, as you've already specified - that would invalidate the premise altogether. If they exist they must be significantly inferior to a human pilot because otherwise even remote drones are gone 

As the title says... What would be the effect to earth or an oceanic planet if it lacks the presence of Radioactive Elements in its crust and mantle. Also can you explain what would happen if we don't have Radioactive Elements in core? 

Law of equivalent exchange - You can't create more than what you have given. (Can be bypassed by Philosophers Stone) Law of Preservation - You can't create anything out of nothingness. Law of Noise - The more magicians are in the vicinity the harder it is to cast magic and its tendency to fail increases as well.(Can be bypassed if one recieved the God of Silence's blessing or massive rituals) Law of Provision - Perversion of natures creation otherwise sentient will be reverted back to its original state or at the very least whats left of it in consideration of the first law. Law of world - The world will always reject perversion of its reality. Law of Time - No one can go to the future or past, offender will face the wrath of the gods and the world. 

The same problems that a normal one time pad face would be faced by our hypothetical Caesar. Namely, if you want to send me a message, I need to have: 

The big thing to remember is that transgender people are a minority of a minority - as little as 0.2-0.3% of the population. Contrast being gay, which clocks in at one in ten. Most people in today's age of interconnectivity won't meet even a single transperson, let alone in pre-modern conditions. The most famous western example was the Marquis d'Eon, who effectively blackmailed the King of France into recognising her as a woman, and even she's pretty obscure (though transgenderism did come close to being named Eonism after her). With that in mind even cheating in modern medical knowledge for the setting would make it pretty difficult for transgendered people - even those with significant means to go with their motivation. But not impossible. Synthetic hormones are produced today using soybeans, which could be procured with effort. From there it wouldn't be outside possibility for a skilled chemist to develop a path to synthesise the appropriate hormone - whether for transition or something more pedestrian like menopause. Bearing in mind the combined rarity of the condition, the difficulty in procuring the raw materials (both base and any reagents needed for production), and the need to retain a personal chemist of no small skill, the whole process of transition, while possible, would be difficult in the extreme. Definitely only for wealthy monarchs or high ranking aristocrats. (Surgery? Sink me, no. The only thing you'd get that way, in those conditions, is another victim of infection.) 

The first thing to accept is that the human race does not have a single mind. The criteria that helps someone decide not to research these alternate humans will cause someone else to. In other words, there will always be people that want to study them, but there are some countermeasures. It's inhumane As a front-line defense, make sure they have similar biology. Very similar. So similar that any attempt to study them would turn up results exactly the same as any human. In this light, media (and social media) would begin to take over. While this is merely a superficial solution, it will at least halt large scale, public research and overall reduce funding towards like studies. It's illegal Something atrocious happened half a century ago involving horrible experiments on the species. Over the following years, laws were put in place making the suggestion of trying to understand them highly sensitive. Once it's tied up in politics and made controversial, a great amount of support will be needed to change the status quo. It's complex Just make their various abilities too difficult too understand. Maybe the details span with information several orders of magnitude larger. Maybe some as of yet undiscovered scientific principle gets in the way of recording data. Something physically prevents them from grasping their nature. Or maybe passive telepathy bores all the researchers to death. 

My answer for this question is to use magic... specifically time magic This creature can be starve with right application of time magic. I doubt it would survive in a time capsule that has its time bubble accelerated to million years per second... It is a living creature thus it needs sustenance... the passage of time is your friend in this case 

So a man who was about to die was given a chance to evade death under the circumstances that he must travel to parallel world earth where magic exists and has only medieval level technology. He has 3 years to prepare before his departure, the date of his death. One of his preparations is about a powered assault armor. With near future technology and virtually unlimited funds. He must achieve the following for the powered assault armor. 

My answer would be Massively scaled stellar mining rig/barge/station (Mining star matter) so fast that leave it for a day or two you'll notice changes happening in the star... But we can go better... You have warp technology right so why not warp stellar matter using hawking radiation(black hole) to another enemy of yours? suck the star of its matter and throw that matter to your enemy! Not only it could collapse a star since it will be missing alot of its mass since you are warping it away but hit another enemy as well with it! Imagine a star being pulled apart and its mass being sent to your enemies! It will not go supernova(as far as i know) but you can be sure that they got nothing on your stellar sized plasma flame thrower... Since this is a galactic strategic weapon price shouldn't be an issue constructing a warp ring enough to engulf atleast 10% of the star or 1% for that matter depending on how fast you want the star gone or your enemy gone... take your pick! 

With these advantages, even a single phoenix is an extremely powerful force multiplier - and mostly without committing to a fight itself, since most of the time the threat of leaving an army exposed to it is enough to gain the upper hand. Two is a massive advantage able to push the enemy around easily (checking their cavalry basically pins them right down). More is completely unfair. 

Oh dear oh dear oh dear. Where do I start? I highly recommend Command and Control by Eric Schlosser. It's an account of American nuclear safety and policy through the Cold War. It's an excellent, if somewhat alarming read. There was a lot that could and nearly did cause a nuclear disaster, especially when they were being flown around by bombers, at least until saner, safety minded people finally prevailed and forced better safety standards. What precisely could have gone wrong? 

You may not realise, but animals no more run by instinct than do humans. Like humans, they too have needs. These needs are served by the Animal Court, lowest of the heavenly courts. Formed from the descendants of twelve virtuous animals (the animals of the Chinese zodiac) the Animal Court convenes twice a year and attends to the administration of the animal world, hearing pleas and grievances and communicating them to the higher courts. Being an official of the Animal Court has its privileges: members of the court are permitted to remove their hides and live as humans while the court is not convened, conducting ourselves as they see fit so long as we do not become derelict in our duties. However, we animal courtiers are feared by humans; Werewolves, wicked humans so cruel they were demoted into bestial forms for their crimes, also wear the skins of animals to savage their fellow humans. Alas, not all werewolves take the form of wolves. Unfortunately, most humans aren't able to distinguish between us and so both of us are hunted alike. In times past, the solution was to convene the court far from prying eyes, away from the cities. But now that humanity has industrialised and humans flock to cities like never before, it has become impossible to simply avoid humans as we once did. But even the cities have animals and the Animal Court is still responsible for them. So the question is: how can we still hold court without getting caught? A few notes:
