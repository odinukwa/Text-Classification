So he holds out some hope, not only for philosophy but also other modes of intellectual and artistic inquiry. I think traditionally this was the role of the academy in society, at least this is the point the Bloom makes in eulogising this instituition in his book, The Closing of the American Mind, which he later, not retracts but is more nuanced about. 

That is, if good is done, then evil will be done in proportion to rebalance the moral universe; like wise for evil. I should be clear, that I'm not advocating this as a moral philosophy, or the seed of one; but am simply looking for reference to someone who has. 

When was the equivalence, or relation between beauty and truth posited? I've taken it to be a feature of neo-Platonism but is this in fact true? Is it in any of Platos own work (which would be strange given his description of art as mimesis) or in Plotinus? Or is it an interpretation of it in the Romantic period in literary and artistic circles? A partial explication of which is given in the beginning of Hardys (the novelist and poet) last novel, The Well-Beloved. A similar discourse about truth and beauty is there in mathematics, Hardy (the mathematician) said for example: 

But for writing, his enthusiasm overcame and over leapt his usual caution; when describing it to his king, 'the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region called by the Greeks, Thebes' and who they themselves called Amun 'Lord of the silent' 

I'm going to answer this question indirectly by critiquing the question of proof; and then not by myself, but by way of quotation, and that by Weyl, a German mathematician famous for bringing symmetry principes to the for in matematical physics, he wrote in Das Kontinuum: 

its easy to see from this that the translated statement (2) is not what the original statement (2) means; which could be better put as 

There is the name of a thing and the thing itself; there is no neccessary connection between the two. (This is a principle in semiotics and a basic observation in the philosophy of language). An apple (in name) is an apple (as a thing); but if I, today, decide to call it a table, it still remains an apple (as a thing) though its name has changed. If someone has never known happiness, and then experience it; then they know what happiness is (as an experience) even if they do not the name of that experience. It is experiences that count and not names. For if someone has never known happiness but has been only told the name of it, then they do not know what it is; as they haven't experienced it. 

I know very little about the mathematical culture of China; but in Europe it's usually taken that Euclid developed the axiomatic method for mathematics; in India, I would suggest that the axiomatic method developed not in mathematics but in grammar - Panini developed the first comprehensive grammar of Sanskrit; and this provoked a philosophy that centred on language; but it shows that the axiomatic method is not restricted to geometry or mathematics; Further, an aspect of Paninis work might be seen as mathematics when one understands that the axiomatisation of logical languages were a feature of 20C Logic/Computer Science (to fully establish this would (or not) take careful and considered analysis). 

This is a distinction for example that Kants points out in his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions; the first merely refers to the propositions logical form, whereas in the latter it refers (Bedeutung) to things of substance in the world, and this is how the proposition gains sense (Sinn) by expressing a thought about the world. It's the crux, too of the difference between Freges and Hilberts conception of what can a proposition signify. Hilbert by focusing on the merely analytic, elaborated a philosophy of formalism; whereas Freges concerns have been 'side-stepped'. To put this into context; consider the pedagogy that goes into teaching geometry - a pedagogy that is forgotten generally when reflecting on the nature of geometry; but not when who had been taught geometry teaches it. We start with lines drawn with rulers, points marked with pencils, and circles drawn by compasses; on paper laid out on a flat table (and Euclidean geometry is flat); then lines are measured with rulers, angles by protracters; and certain algorithms are followed or thought through... Thus we get a feeling of how geometry is in the world; later when we compose them in the mind when given a sketch of the argument in writing or a sketch of a diagram surely this sense remains there to fill out the form of our thought that thinks on the geometric proposition presented to us. Thus one might say that we gain a certain geometric intuition ... So, yes; for when we fully reflect on what it takes to consider the thought contained in an argument; we see that we must consider the genealogy of the thought that leads upto the argument, and also at the same time, we must consider too the genealogy of its parts - it's terms - that is its explanation. 

In propositional logic, a syntactic proposition can be evaluated to be correct or not semantically via truth tables. However this appears to exclude the context of the proposition, that is its inference rules - natural deduction or axiomatic. That is the semantic truth of a proposition is independent of the inference rules that allow us to syntactically/logically establish a proof from the axioms. I find this a little odd. Surely a proof should have also a semantic status too? 

The question then becomes is this law universally valid? Are there conceptual schemes in which it can be weakened? On the face of it, 1+1 is not equal to 2; they look different; however the context supplies a proof that the first can be altered into the second, and back; this is why I say essentially rather than exactly in my first sentence. One could say in a certain language that they are homotopic (to make this precise - we are moving into the realm of homotopy type theory from type theory) Hence Leibnizs law though essentially true, is not exactly true; and this can be made more formal. In Set Theory, choosing ZF for precision, Leibnizs law is translated into the axiom of extensionality: 

I've seen this in quite a few places, I'm just wondering if it's a cultural myth, or whether it actually has a basis in fact. 

What evidence does he have for this? For example, Hero of Alexandria showed that the motion of light followed the path of least distance. Was there any speculation at the time or post this, or before, that this law could be generalised? Could one say that Leibniz had a least principle? The 'reflection' of least is best. And he did say that God created the 'best of all possible worlds'. 

In Badious philosophy, he has considers that Poltics, Art, Science & Love to be four truth-procedures, and that Philosophy is suspended from the other three; but it can be sutured to them too. What does it mean for Philosophy to be sutured to Music - an art-form? 

This also speaks for itself - but to expand: Russells paradox is not a paradox, has absolutely nothing to do with the divine; and represents only the limitations of what was known about the construction of set theory in Russells time; it represents an obstacle by which theory must be modified otherwise it anulls itself. There may be more than one viable modification. One particular direction is to adopt a paraconsistent logic as done by Newton Da Costa for the foundations of set theory (rather than the first-order logic of Russells to a first approximation). Here a Universal set U and a Russell set R is given; and one can prove theorems like the union of every set in R is actually U. What this example also affirms is that we do not know logic as a complete mechanism of thought. Wittgenstein ends the Tractatus by the following: 

Hermeneutics is the science of interpretation of texts, which might be relevant; here, they start off with the proposition: 

This is Pantheism. What Ayer is saying is that if the world is God, then one might as just as well talk of the world rather than God. One could argue that the world is part of God, which is what Spinoza did, and then one has a distinction. One can argue if the world was created by God, then by being of his creation, and supposing nothing can be created out of nothing, then the world must be of Gods substance. Hence the World is part divine. This may or may not be Spinozas argument but given as an example how one can argue this position. From another perspective, identifying the World with God is saying rather a lot - for then God is there. to be found. After all some people see Gods will writ in its laws. Others say the World is the greater Quran. And what little we know about the world has been wrestled from it with immense effort. It is no small thing. 

You start with 'the set of all things'. This already involves a contradiction. See Russells Set Paradox. From a contradiction anything can be proved... 

This to me, makes it very plausible, despite the large secondary literature which says otherwise, that Gauss was directly influenced by Kant in guiding his attention to discovering a consistent non-Euclidean geometry by opening the possibility that there could possibly be one. Of course, this would mean that Kant would have had an indirect influence on Einsteins SR and GR - given their use of such geometries. 

Classically we think of an electron as a point particle which generates an electric field; one speaks of an electron and it's field - as though they are two ontologically different concepts; in a sense they are as one lacks all extension and the other does not. The electron as a particle is generally regarded as prior, as is captured by how one speaks or writes of it. But, in no instance do we see the bare electron without this field; so by what reasoning should we think of it as prior; other than the bias we have for atomic theories? Let us try a little Gedanken experiment and eliminate the electron whilst leaving the field as it is. Can we locate the classical position of the electron? Yes - by locating the position of the field with the most electric intensity. Can we quantify the charge that this hypothetical particle has? Yes - because the relation to a field to its charge is deterministic. Given that the particle can be determined - it's position and properties, from the field; and classically we can determine the field from the particle - so the two pictures are equivalent; then by what principle should we choose the particle picture over the field? 

In 1870, Clifford, the English mathematician and sometime philosopher wrote the following in his book, On the Space theory of Matter; 

To utter, is to enunciate; the utterer, is a speaker, ie a subject; and thus the subject of enunciation; also I'd read colouring as ambivalence; especially when one considers the platitude 'not everything is black and white', meaning that ambivalence is not 'black and white' but 'coloured'. Given all this, it seems that the 'per se' is indicating the sentence without the qualifier; for example, using the sentence: 

a. Why does Quine say "set theory in sheep's clothing"? I tend to agree with Shapiro on the tension between deductiveness & expressiveness. b. But are there useful results which naturally use the higher-order expressiveness either in their proof or statement, apart from the categoricity of 2-logic as opposed to 1-logic. Since higher logic with Henkin semantics reduces to typed 1-logic it seems essential to keep full semantics. 

A sentence is a proposition when it is asking you to evaluate whether it is true or not; in English this is shown by a sentence in the form of a question 

The biologist Stephen Gould had a theory of non-overlapping magisteria for the truths of science as opposed to religion. An update of this can be found in Badiou where he posits four sites of not truth but truth-procedures: love, art, politics and science. Notably and curiously as he is a philosopher, philosophy is missing in this account - but this is simply because he takes philosophy to be dialectic and Socratic; and the clay from which these sites were fashioned. The logic that ties these sites and their suspension is not classical but intuitive, paraconsistent and progressive (in Whitehead - dynamic). Notably again religion is missing from this account - and one might remark here that Badiou being explicitly communist has the common communist prejudice against religion; one cannot say because it is not scientific - for art is not scientific either. One can perhaps locate an additional site for religion fashioned from the other four: From Love: revelation or unveiling, and the relationship of personal involvement, as in Bubers I-Thou; luminousity and personal transcendence; also community - agape From Politics: the clearing of space so that it's being can be, sought or defended From Art: the numinous and the archetype; ritual and tradition; the positing of worlds other than this From science: scholarship, exegesis, and hermeneutics. Then religion having its own truth-procedure is neither denied nor affirmed by science (though in some senses it can be). If this seems rather as though the issue is being ducked; recall the logic that ties these sites including now religion together is paraconsistent and dynamic.
