Let's start with Naismith's rule. 5km/h and 30mins for every 300m climbed, that'll give you about 90mins for a round trip. Call it 2 hours because even slaves need to rest. We considered 1/4 to 1/3 of body weight reasonable to carry on long expeditions, these are slaves though and we don't want to get too soft on them, so half body weight is fine. Unfortunately this requires us to know the health and weight of your slaves, so I'll call them an average 60kg and give them a 14 hour working day, allowing each working slave to haul 210kg up the hill per day. It may be reasonable to push that to 16 hours, 8 trips and 240kg per slave, you're only expecting them to last 5 years after all. Quora tells me that the average person consumes 1.8kg of food and 0.9kg of water per day (that's not enough water, you should be drinking more), total only 2.7kg per person or 4050kg for the whole court. Some of your court are going to be average, but given that it's a royal court I think it's reasonable to at least double that, call it 6kg per person or 9000kg for the whole court. Of course some of the concubines won't eat that much but many of the senior courtiers will eat more. Meaning that each slave can supply 35-40 people's daily needs. If you keep your slaves working hard, around 50* slaves are required to supply your court of 1500. This only supplies the daily essentials of course, but it shows that vast numbers are not required for basic supply. Given the low numbers and the fact that apart from a few household slaves they can all live at the bottom of the hill, it's not necessary to worry about hauling up goods for the slaves themselves. The real key to this is that you're talking <100 slaves rather than >1000. Or about 18,000 slaves a year if you're using those new disposable single use slaves. * 42.8, but which bit of the slave do you cut off to make 0.8 of a slave? 

Make America Great Britain Again There's no point hunting them down. They'll die soon enough anyway. As soon as you've killed off most of your population the next country over will invade what's left. If they don't invade you'll probably find your survivalists were all men so there won't be another generation. If they were not all men the women will probably die in childbirth. 

The only logical answer to make the gate work in practice is that speed relative to the gate is maintained. You can worry about the difference in energies when you've worked out how much energy is needed to actually translate a ship across the galaxy. After that, changing the speed of the ship by a mere few hundred km/s is probably a minor detail. The problem with portals is that they tend to breach the laws of thermodynamics. Just place the exit over the entrance in a gravitational field and watch what happens. 

I know what I've said here is controversial, I'm not pretending to be nice, if you want to change the world slowly you can be nice, but we're trying to change the world fast. In a situation where you have to change an attitude that's held steady for thousands of years then you're going to upset a lot of people. To start with you're going to upset the kind of people who don't believe that it's government's job to change attitudes from the top down. The people as a whole aren't going to suddenly all decide that they're never going to go to war again. There are too many people romanticising it. Too many people believing in rewards in the next world if they die because of it. To clear that quickly needs top down change with heavy handed enforcement. You need to stop the current generation telling the next generation that it's a good thing. That might require a lot of people to disappear if they really won't shut up. A few governments will have to be overthrown, a lot of people are going to die. Some of those governments will have been elected by the will of the people, but it's the will of the people that we're fundamentally trying to change. 

Build a tax inspectors' office on top of it. Easy way to keep the general population well clear of the area. If you want to move lots of heavy equipment in and out then you could build a retail distribution warehouse over it, then nobody would question the trucks coming and going and such things are generically boring. Make sure your scientists work in blue overalls instead of white coats and it's unlikely anyone will notice anything. You might have to advertise jobs at the place locally, interview a few people but not actually give anyone a position. 

Gas him, drown him, electrocute him, set him on fire. You're thinking in terms of applied violence which is his strength. Use things that aren't his strengths against him. 

It's all about orbital mass drivers. Just fire a suitably sized rock in from orbit, all of the destruction but none of the mess. For hundreds of years the greatest siege weapon was simply the biggest rock you could throw. Take it to the next level and drop it from orbit. 

There are two options here, the gryphons can fly (like an eagle) or the gryphon can glide (like a flying squirrel). In the former case you're looking at herd animals of larger sizes than normal keeping a sky watch. Large eagles can take young lambs, fauns and the like. However as they get older they get too big to remain prey from the sky. If there were much larger avian predators, larger creatures would remain alert to threats from the air. There might also be a tendency to become larger. Exceeding the maximum size the predator can handle being a valid defence from aerial predation. (I'm ignoring minor details like the things being too heavy to fly.) In the latter case I can't see it being an especially practical hunter if it can only glide from a perch. Animals would largely be safe on the open plains as long as they kept clear of high cliffs. As an example of this sort of learned behaviour, there are herds of deer that still won't approach where the cold war borders used to be. 

Whether it's human sacrifice, gladiators (to the death), duelling (to the death of course) or trial by combat (need I say it?), a god who encouraged/demanded these things could become known by outsiders as a god of murder. This is classic us and them propaganda. 

A virus like this could rapidly cripple the economy, but you're unlikely to be able to contain it enough to protect your own people. 

All in this gives the correct length of sword for your giant. You should note that the length of the sword is not a matter of his strength, but his reach. He needs to be able to extend his off-hand beyond the tip of the blade. 

It's going to be very hard for them to advance as far as knights in shining armour. They lack resources, not a lot of wood at sea at the best of times and what there is isn't in very good condition. They're going to be spending a lot of time thinking about shipworms and scurvy, and much less time thinking about how to most efficiently weave their wool into cloth. Where do they keep the sheep anyway? They could be a great trading nation, but even to build their ships they're going to need permanent or semi-permanent land bases and those land bases will be the ultimate home of their advancing technology, not those out to sea. The shift from seafaring to land based culture could well be traumatic, I can just imagine the reaction of the parents when the son says he's running away to land, to be a shepherd in the dangerous hills where the wolves roam free and you don't have a ship to keep you safe. 

We haven't yet hit a point where this is happening, even though we should have. This site has the UK unemployment rate from 1971 

The waste of civilisation With the best will in the world, humanity is far from efficient and we generate a vast amount of waste. What currently goes to landfill, slag and spoil heaps could just as well go into feeding the great machine that powers civilisation. Then top up with water. 

If the druids also have gryphons then my money is on them, otherwise I think it heavily favours the Griffin Republic. Now all you need is a druish princess 

"Ever" is a very difficult word. The limitation is greatly helped by their lack of dexterity suggesting that they're not going to build complex tools to help with the task, but even little things like identifying plants that are poisonous to their herds and killing them as they travel would be steps along the line to farming. This behaviour would fall somewhere along the transition between true nomadic herding and transhumance, where seasonal pastures are used. The next step would be removing plants that are of no interest to the herds or overrun the grasslands they need for food. At what point does this sort of behaviour translate into cultivation? Since their primary plant of interest is grass (or equivalent) they never need to sow seeds, but they can still work towards effective monoculture farming just by elimination of plants of no interest. Population limitations Population of a species is primarily limited by food supply. A large tribe with a large herd would be able to expand, though at some point they'd exceed the number of people their herds could support. This would give an advantage to a farming tribe with greater supply of food for the herds to allow the herds to grow at an equivalent rate. To prevent this advantage the population would have to be limited by some other mechanism than food limitation. Drought The rains didn't come, the grass didn't get the autumn/winter/spring growth, there's ever less food especially for those moving where another tribe has moved ahead of them. A tribe who had farmed and stored food would still be able to feed the herds from the store, again an advantage over the nomads. Possibly offset by allowing them to travel great distances relatively quickly, but it would still require quite low population density so they're not treading on each other's toes. Immobility Possibly a large portion of the group were injured in a conflict or are elderly forcing them to remain in one place for longer than normal and work to improve the local pasture for the herds to survive. Rich grasslands The tribe has wandered into a temperate region where they no longer need to be nomadic. As long as they do a bit of basic ground clearance to get rid of the brambles and deadly nightshade they can settle down and build. 

By their awareness of other whales and the knowledge of the traders and pilgrims who pass between them. If the whale is slowly sinking over years or decades then the residents are unlikely to notice other than old people moaning, and old people always moan. It's reasonable to ignore anything they're saying about the sun being brighter and the stars clearer when they were young. Over the time periods you're implying, the changes are so slow and subtle they can be written off as faulty memory. It's only the people moving around between the whales who will notice that this particular whale is considerably lower in the atmosphere than others. 

Schadenfreude doesn't stand a chance, nor does verschlimmbesserung, one of my favourite German words and which probably applies directly to this answer. There's another problem, that being word for word translation. I apologise to any non-native English speakers for the following: The bowman in the bow took a bow before stringing his bow that was cut from a bough of the great yew tree in Bow. Any straight word for word translator would fail completely on that sentence, it'd probably take a couple of attempts even for a native speaker who knows where Bow is. This leaves us with homonyms and place names with easily identified meanings. Mill Hill, Bow, Mile End, Wood Green, translating these as words hinders rather than helps. 

Total financial chaos What's that got to do with it? It's been a long time since the money was real and held in your hand or written on paper. The money now exists only in the computer, being sent from one computer to another as a number. You've just wiped the whole lot. Ownership of general stuff is probably known, but all the people who own things through lawyers and shell companies around the world probably can't track half of it. Pay the rent? With what, to whom, and how? The problem isn't that you've lost your desktop computer and there's no point going to work (How were you planning to get there anyway? Better start walking), the problem is that everyone has lost everything. We're so dependent on computers now that this loss of data would mean you might as well set up a forge and start beating ploughshares into swords. 

One look at Syria should make this question redundant I've lost count of how many armed groups there currently are, most of them are at war with each other as well as the government. Some of them have the same underlying aims, they merely want to be the ones in charge at the end. At least one is just crazy. A couple of armed groups are simply fighting for their own survival, the list goes on. The West is backing at least two, while being openly at war with one. Russia is backing the government. Turkey seems to shoot at whoever they dislike most this week. You're really not limited to only one rebellion, far from it. 

The key to a cloning teleporter is that it's not 50/50 whether you stay or go, it's both. You stay, and you go. This is where religion and philosophy come into it. The continuity problem Picking the first result from google to explain this 

Ginger tabby It's a tried and tested colouration for a nocturnal predator, showing up strongly in the resulting gene pool. The tabby patterning helps to break up the outline against a background. As has already been mentioned, most nocturnal prey don't have colour vision so the fact ginger shows up strongly to us doesn't mean that's true of dichromatic creatures. Just try not to make them too cute or the whole "vermin" thing isn't going to work out. 

Economic stagnation Without inflation it becomes viable to hoard currency. With inflation hoarded currency slowly loses value (around 50% per decade) so to maintain wealth, the currency must be made to work. Currency hoarded is currency effectively lost to the system, to maintain a fixed price system you must match your currency supply to the economy. Risks: People hoarding wealth remove so much money from the economy that the system grinds to a halt, 1 loaf costs 1 lobe, but there aren't any lobes. 1 loaf now costs 4 eggs, or 6 carrots or what have you got my children are starving. You print replacement currency because people are hoarding, those hoards are then dropped into the market causing an inflation spike, 1 loaf costs 1 lobe, 1 egg costs 10,000 lobes and people are taking their pay home in wheelbarrows and it still won't buy enough flour to make 1 loaf regardless of what the loaf costs. 

Note that they're much the same. They're both fundamentally oxygen starvation, though one is chronic and the other acute. One European standard blood bag: 600ml (pdf) 

Hydroponics is a technology you can use when soil is scarce but but water is plentiful. However in the situation you describe, water is also scarce. This will mean that hydroponics is not a viable solution. Solar stills can be used on a small scale to evaporate and condense drinking water, normally they're only used in survival situations as there's almost always a better way of doing it. However as a technology it can be scaled up to produce reasonable quantities of water, but not practically to the point of producing industrial quantities of water. Powered methods of distilling fresh water from sea water or other contaminated water tend to be prohibitive on power consumption. That's prohibitive now, not just prohibitive post-apocalypse. In short, your coastal villages can possibly generate enough drinking water for themselves and maybe some irrigation from a system of solar stills. They're not going to be able to produce enough water either to supply other villages or to run hydroponics. Water efficiency can be improved by growing in raised beds and collecting all water run off to prevent wastage from irrigation. However in doing this the overall quality of the local soil will not be improved. Effort should be put into improving the soil as early as practical after initial survival issues are resolved.
