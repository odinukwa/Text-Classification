Quick gains achieved by following magic supplements / super diets / training regimes usually do not last for very long and for a good reason. Body itself won't allow them to inflict this kind of damage to their bodies over extend period of time. At some point it will burn out one way or another (read: injury/ get ill / losing motivation, inspiration and etc). It might be fun trying something out and you can even catch the bug! But to achieve long standing results the 'time' variable might go out from the equation. 

Usually it happens when muscles are used without warming up with too high weight or are too tired after heavy exercise and are screaming for glucose. Warm them up prior workout - with low weight / high rep approach to pump some blood in them. 

There's no specific angle. Focus on what feels right for you. Since you feel your chest more when doing it at 90 degrees, try to keep it around that. 

Trust me, stay 250-300 above your maintenance level of calories and keep your protein high and you won't gain much fat. This way you will get bigger a lot quicker rather than sitting in a caloric deficit all the time. Also, when you first start working out you can easily build muscle and lose fat at the same time, something referred to as "beginner gains", but after you workout for longer than a year, the way to see more progress is to be above maintenance level in terms of calories. In terms of biceps not getting bigger, I think you should keep doing compound lifts while in a caloric surplus. Compound movements do help your arms get bigger, just keep increasing the weight as you get stronger. Also, including curls can help shape your arms. Lastly, there is a genetic factor that comes into play. Some people have better chest genetics and others have better arm genetics. So if your biceps are lacking and you have tried everything, it could be genetics. 

Visible abs are achievable in this time. Question is, how much are you willing to sacrifice / give away to reach this goal? Apply intensive [insert any diet name] diet. Apply any specific training program designed to decrease overall body fat. Get tempted and buy fat burners. 

Counting calories won't do much help. It was already stated the calorie system is broken as it applies differently to different people (ArsTechnica article - if anyone interested). To improve your effectiveness in loosing weight i would suggest replacing any processed food (including bars / protein snacks and etc) with whole food. Add more greens to your diet, spinach, kale leaves, spring onions and whatever is in your local food store. Add oils, cold pressed olive oil and/or coconut oil. Simple carbs replaced by complex carbs as we still need those to optimally function. It would be miss not to mention physical activities. Do something outdoor that is enjoyable and it'll help you burn calories and get fitter. If you do not have a pet, i would suggest getting one preferable young with loads of energy and enthusiasm for going out. 

If you wish to lose weight just eat less. Find out how many calories you need to maintain your current weight and just eat 250-500 calories less than that. If your main goal is to lose weight it doesn't really matter what you eat, but eating healthy is always better. As for dark chocolate I believe it suppresses your appetite, due to the amount of fibre it contains. So it basically helps you stay in a caloric deficit. 

Green tea can help aid in weight loss, but the only way to actually lose weight is to stay in a CALORIC DEFICIT - so your body burns more energy than you give it through food. Basically as far as I know, green tea has the ability to burn more calories, so it helps you achieve the caloric deficit easily. As for drinking green tea 4 times a day. I would recommend drinking each cup at the same interval throughout the day for maximum benefits. 

The eccentric phase of a lift is classically part of mass gaining but there are other practices which skip almost all eccentric training and produce large mass gain. One group are Olympic Weightlifters, who drop the majority of their lifts. They do not lack for mass! $URL$ Another practice is the eccentric-less extra workouts done by Westside styles powerlifters. Skipping the eccentric phase can allow more total work done b/c as noted above, it is the most damaging. For one take on how concentric-only has produced great mass (and strength!!!!!!!!) gains, here is a take from Glenn Pendlay, training of many of America's best weightlifters: $URL$ 

Google egg white powder and you can see it sold as a supplement. This will probably be product specific. The product itself will probably have storage instructions. 

Progression in planks can take the form of added resistance, like you would with other muscles. AKA, add load. Weighted planks. Or weighted reverse planks. $URL$ 

Every person is different in terms of how many calories they burn each day and how fast their metabolism is. 

There is no way to change your genetic potential. If you wish to get bigger and stronger you should eat more (healthier is better, and protein is important) and workout. If you wish to lose weight you should workout and eat less. Its important to determine how many calories you need each day and then either increase or decrease them to reach your goal. With hard word and proper diet you can reach your genetic potential after 3-4 years of training. If you aren't satisfied with your genetics then steroids would be an option but I would not recommend that. 

People store fat first in different body parts. For example person A could store fat first in their belly and then their face. Person B could store fat first in their face and then their belly, its different for every person. Neglecting metabolism, people who say they eat a lot and don't gain weight are not actually eating enough and vice versa. Best way is to count calories! 

If it hurts, don't do it. Here's document on treating your rotator cuffs $URL$ But again, if it hurts you, don't do it. Benching with a barbell and dips commonly hurt people's shoulders. If you don't need to do those lifts, switch to exercises that don't hurt. Dumbbell benches, presses, etc. are more often pain free movements for people. 

Hip thrusts and glute bridges are glute (butt) specific. I suggest checking out Brett Contreras aka The Glute Guy for training advice based on both appearance and performance goals. 

Are you really 9% ? Here's one verification: $URL$ Also you don't mention if you are also doing any other training besides the cardio. Are you? Note that training can increase water retention which would increase bodyweight without gaining fat, giving the impression of an increase in LBM. 

Fat burning zones are foolish. Sprinters never train in the fat burning zone and are ripped. Higher intensity exercise can raise your metabolism long after you are done training. The shortest answer is, eating carbs when training stops burning fats, as eating carbs generally stops burning fat. 

If your main goal is too lose weight then just staying in a caloric deficit of 250-500 calories should be what you aim for. So find out how many calories you need to maintain your current weight here and then just subtract 250-500 from it. This will help you lose weight. For your runs, it depends on what your goals are. Do you want to increase your stamina?, become faster?, etc. But what I would recommend is making a routine and tracking your progress. So I cant really say how often you should do it without more information, but getting enough rest is always important As for building muscle, if you haven't worked out before, you will be able to lose fat and build muscle at the same time. So doing exercise with the dumbbells and other body weight movements would be beneficial. Also remember to get enough protein if you plan to build muscle.
