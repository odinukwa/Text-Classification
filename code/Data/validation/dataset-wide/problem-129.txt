They Incorporated in Late 1814 Rather than 1832 What a difference 18 years makes! In the year 1814 - towards the end of the War of 1812 - the people of the Republic of Indian Stream discovered the ambiguous wording of the Treaty of Paris while a few men debated which side of the war they should fall under. Not seeking competition with two actively engaged countries at war, a representative was sent to both Canada and the United States with a unique offer - ratify RIS as a neutral territory for use in diplomatic discussions! And so it was. Unfortunately for the soldiers who were wounded or lost their lives, the processes involved with ratifying the RIS as a neutral country took sufficiently long to resolve (~6+ months) that the country was never used as a convenient location for civil discussion on alternatives to continued aggression. Following the war neither country had an appetite to attempt to capture the territory as the RIS was a symbol of joint, peaceful cooperation. 

Building a ramp OVER the wall was used by the Romans. They would use local captives to minimize the chance of the beseiged city fighting back. Then there's the offensive reverse moat, used historically by an Assyrian father-son pair of kings when beseiging large cities. They dug a large (20 ft deep) trench entirely surrounding the city that was too deep to jump into and too wide to cross. Starved them into submission. You also forgot poisoning the water supply and choking them out by judging the winds and setting fire so the smoke blows over the castle. 

There's a bunch of answers, but none touched on the possibility suggested in my comment so I'll add it in here: The spell doesn't transfer or teach any new knowledge. Rather, it induces a sort of controlled synesthesia, in which the listener sees a vague image or other comprehension/gut feeling linked to the words the speaker is saying. As such: 

Parts of it may collapse inwards a bit, if they were only held together very tenuously. Overall the effect would be rather pleasant, smoothing a surface that otherwise is likely extremely sharp and irregular. In fact, you may way to have people go around and pound down the surface a bit, as walking on it would probably be akin to walking in a field covered in large glass shards. Dangerous for the feet, and even more dangerous if you need to keep your space suit contained. Note that if you choose to give the asteroid some type of warm atmosphere as well, that would have a huge (and possibly destabilizing) effect on the asteroid. Update 1 Thinking about this a bit more, I think you might WANT an asteroid that has a noticeable amount of frozen water (and/or other liquids/gasses that solidify at deep space temperatures) in it. If we assume that your gravity generator is in a sufficiently shielded capsule in the middle, once you add in your atmosphere (however this occurs) the asteroid would be ripped violently into pieces - and that would be desirable. Specifically that process could be used to accelerate the decomposition of the sharp rocky parts of the asteroid, which would probably have quite a time escaping a body with the same gravity as earth. Sure it would fire off like a rocket, but it takes a REALLY powerful rocket to escape Earth's atmosphere and gravity. After a waiting period gravity would settle things out and I would expect that, on average, you would have fewer large sharp pieces. You would probably end up with some significant sinkholes-in-waiting, but that's likely to occur naturally anyway. To counter-balance that, if you were to increase the gravity of the asteroid SIGNIFICANTLY during the process you would both decrease your wait period between explosion and settling AND decrease the number of unstable/thin-shelled holes in the resulting body. 

Since metals are operating in a different system than gems, out makes sense to say they contain different mechanics. When you talked about weaving runes with metal, the first thing that sprung to mind was electrical circuitry. Metal runes are basically inscribed circuits that provide magical integrated hardware! Gold, silver, and platinum are just the best magical semiconductors... Gems are a little trickier. According to your post, they get inscribed but not inlaid. There are many gemstones and crystals that are semiprecious or common that would presumably have no magical properties, like quartz, salt, and amethyst. So it can't be pure crystalline structure. What else? Well, all precious stones form under deep heat and pressure, mostly volcanic conditions. The earth's core is a massive magical source, and the deeper down a gem is formed, the more ambient magic is absorbed into its crystalline structure! Surface formations like salt and geodes would have little inherent magic. Precious veined metals (rather than ores) are too amorphous to retain magic in their lodes, but are still attuned to magic which is how they can be woven into runes. These runes create effects by drawing magic from the ambient surroundings: the more magical the area, the more powerful the spell. Precious gems work in the opposite manner: they are magical super capacitors and generators. Carving a rune into them allows you to control the external flow if magic. The larger the gem and the more flawless the crystalline structure, the more magical capacity the gem has and the more powerful it is. So you have two complementing methods: woven metal runes generate magic from channeling external energies, precious gems from internal energies trapped during crystal formation further down toward the magical core of the planet. Update: With this system, you can have a REALLY crafty crafter who inscribes gems with runes and then weaves metallic runes AROUND them - the gold concentrating the magic of the gem even further! Perhaps by focusing the magical energies into coherence this creates a "magical laser?" Might it cause a feedback loop and result in a huge explosion? There are all sorts of ways to go with this one, though I pity the poor sod who's the first to try it out... They'll probably spend months scraping him off the walls... 

Headline: HAVE WE GONE TOO FAR? The populace of the world was so shocked by the images of devastation and despair in Japan following the dropping of the atomic bomb that discussion of whether we had gone too far becomes commonplace and heavily considered. When America additionally dropped a nuclear weapon on Germany (or maybe just an island somewhere near Europe controlled by Germany) for failing to sign its surrender in time the discussion was intensified in a way that we never saw it. Suddenly it is not just a weapon fired between two very different peoples, it is one that is even used between superficially similar people - and that gives a whole new tone to the discussion. This image is printed somewhere in every publication for years (usually in grayscale): 

No Answer Is Available (Reality-Check Tag Response) The truth is that we have not found that non-carbon life is possible, let alone identified what type of blood it may have. The closest case that I am aware of was the "Arsenic-based" bacteria... which still requires carbon. It can use arsenic instead of phosphorus (though it still prefers phosphorus), but carbon is still essential. Silicon is often suggested as an alternative to carbon to support life, but that seems exceedingly doubtful. Other elements that would replace carbon have it even worse than silicon - the chemistry just doesn't support it. For reactions with similarly "possible" elements you end up needing either very low temperatures to ensure reaction stability or you need to work with a ridiculously limited set of possible combinations. Unfortunately, working with very low temperatures precludes liquids from existing in cells (generally), which is believed to be a requirement. Fewer available combinations means that the complex structures necessary could not be created. This is where one would often say "So pick whatever you want, because when it's impossible it's all equally valid", but that's not really the case. Plenty of chemical combinations result in fire or reduce quickly... hopefully another answer can ignore the "reality-check" tag and provide an answer which, at least, won't immediately corrode the veins of your creatures or ignite them. 

Since you're looking for "clean breaks," you'd have to get "creative" with your application of genetics... As I commented, doing 4 magics and a single mundane is fairly easy, since we have 4 bases. Assuming a single base in the magic gene is the determinant for affinity, this would make your phenotypes AA, CC, TT, GG, plus the six mixed bases (AC, AT, AG, CT, CG, TG). The "pure" phenotypes would be magical, and the mixed pairs would be mundane. This implies that half the population has no magical ability, and the remaining half is evenly divided among the four types. If two people share the exact magic affinity, then they will have a child with that exact magic affinity. If they have differing magic affinities, then their child will ABSOLUTELY be mundane. BUT, if there is a magic and non-magic pair, the chance still exists for the child to share the affinity of the magic parent. Assuming you don't know the genetic makeup of the mundane parent, then the chance of them having no matching bases (and therefore will always have a mixed base child) is (3/4*2/4)=3/8ths, meaning there is a 5/8ths chance of sharing a base and a resulting 5/16th's chance of the child being magical. For a mundane/mundane couple, each has 6 possible phenotypes, making 36 possibilities. Each has a single "opposite" phenotype with no chance of magical offspring (1/6 of magic not being possible). Matching mundane phenotypes (1/6 chance) would give a 1/2 chance of magical offspring of either of the base genotypes. The remaining 24 matches have single matches, which lead to a 1/4 chance of magical offspring. Once you've got genetic sequencing, you can ensure that "matching bases" always exist among couples which raises your chance of a magical child to 1/2 for a magic/mundane couple, 1/2 for a mundane/mundane couple where both bases match, and 1/4 for a couple with only 1 matching base. Hypothetically, you could do this without sequencing if you prevented mundanes from marrying one another - that means a mundane from a given union will always have at least the base of the magical parent, and mixed magic union will have a mundane human with a known pair of phenotypes. This gets us to 5 traits, though, not 6. To quote Wikipedia: 

It should be noted however that the article discusses this event in context of a global ice age (which caused the straight to "close"). In your world however, it has simply always been that way. So you should expect some permanent warming the the Atlantic, permanent cooling in the Pacific (due to the larger "hole" between the arctic and Pacific ocean pumping more fresh water down that way). Another Major Caveat That said, I actually expect that moving continents that much would have a larger impact on global climates by either allowing more area for new crosswinds to develop between continents or reducing opportunities. However there is no research available on such a fictional world, so I cannot supply a guess as to the impact while the "hard science" tag is in use. 

Don't Look for Energy - Go for Infrastructure The problem with freezing powers is that they actively suck energy out of wherever they are used. The movement of the energy itself could be useful, except that it's simply magic'd away to nothingness, which is not very helpful. However, the queen's magic is also capable of very quickly building robust structures (eg. castles in seconds) and fine items (eg. finely tailored dresses) - which are very useful attributes. Rapid Prototyping The ability to quickly test ideas to identify what works and what doesn't is a HUGE accelerator for all manners of innovation. 3D printing revolutionized industry for us just a few decades ago; imagine what the world would have been like if it existed hundreds of years ago! Instead of taking dozens of years to refine industrial designs, the Queen could help refine them in DAYS. Ice-Dams and Hydro-Power One such use in an industrial revolution is to quickly create very large dams capable of holding vast amounts of water. Such dams could be fitted to power anything from mills to hydroelectric generators, very quickly allowing you to leap ahead technically. Sure, they will need a re-charge every so often, but if you kept a sawmill in operation with the output you could probably cut all the wood you need to replicate it in wood before long. 

Yes, neutrality in war is a valid strategy if there is enough of a disparity of resources between your superpower and the less civilized warring nations. Based upon the scenario you've given us, it sounds like we're at the start of the Scientific revolution. Your Superpower probably has not only an advantage in native resources, but also an influx of wealth and a resulting knowledge gap. Such a society would progress far more rapidly than its neighbors, quickly becoming a fearsome presence much like the major empires (Hittite, Assyrian, and Egyptian) of the Bronze Age. In the real world, Europe was so broken up historically with tribal/royal warfare that no one maintained a monopoly on resources or knowledge long enough to exploit it effectively. Perhaps the best correlate, both geographically and technologically, would be the Ottoman Empire, which was at the height of it's power at the start of the 17th century. Without a Russia on it's northern border or the religio-cultural strife caused by the class distinctions between Christians and Muslims, the empire might well have retained it's full power into the 19th and 20th centuries. If you've got resource poor North and South separated by a Mediterranean, your resource rich Superpower would want to supply both sides with raw goods to fuel their own economy. Then, when the war dies down, they flex their muscle against the weak winner and expand their territory. The institutions of learning in your progressive Ottoman empire can't be mirrored in your surrounding medieval societies which are basically struggling for everyday sustenance and border squabbles. Since most people in the warring lands would be illiterate (as historically they were), your advanced empire wouldn't need to worry as much about knowledge leaking across the border - not enough people would have the resources, background, and technical skill to replicate their more advanced technology, especially if there was a linguistic barrier on top of everything else. The political ramifications? As an important crossroads between north and south, They would be courted for favor by everyone. If there's a threat, it's probably from the more stable Western nations banding together to challenge supremacy of your Superpower, since they share similar advantages for trade and war as the single nation, and it might be easier to play one minor nation against the other rather than dealing with a monolithic superpower. Ultimately, though, I think your "middle" nation is doomed to fail from the Superpower mopping up after the civil war and the opposing western nations seeking to expand their holdings. The resulting collapse of the middle nation would result in an east-vs-west clash, as your border countries expand toward your superpower and the "inner" western nations (who can't expand into the middle kingdom) will diplomatically plead the superpower into conflict with their neighbors so they can expand themselves. The result of this evolution in conflict is outside the scope of what you're asking, though. 

Here's the thing though: the Loon is much more related to the Heron (by DNA) than the Mallard. Mallards belong to a species that breaks with Heron's at the first demarcation point within the Aves class, while Loons share two claves within the Aves class with Herons (Ardeae & Aequornithes). So maybe all we need to do is move the Heron from the Order Pelecaniformes to the Order Gaviiformes, which both share two claves within the Class "Aves" to meet your need? That's probably easy enough to accomplish. Herons share many physical traits with loons, and it is entirely conceivable that with the right environmental pressures a Heron could arise from that group. But there is a Catch It seems likely to me that if Herons were evolving in the Gaviiformes order they would be competing with early Storks if they share the same environment. That means that either you would need to put Herons somewhere physically well separated from Storks and their descendants, or accept that the Ciconiiformes (Storks), Suliformes, and Pelecaniformes are going to lose species (eg. Ibis's may cease to exist). 

The Mage relents, sensibly noting that the combined forces might prove a valid threat to his conquest. He withdraws and the humans manage to escape. Humans win. The Mage laughs and kills them outright. This reinforces the fact that he views them as weak and not a threat. The murder of the delegation is an open declaration of war, spurring the elves to ally with the humans. Humans win. 

Proxima Centauri may have a rocky, earth like planet close to its dim sun. Tidally locked, the sun facing side may have a temperature up to 30 degrees Celsius and a dark side of -30 C. This would make one side temperate with liquid water, and the other frozen like antarctica - cold, but not unbelievably so. Assuming it holds on to its atmosphere, what sort of weather systems might we find on such a planet, where one side is perpetually day time (with moderate weather) and the other a frozen night? Taking this further, if I may, would we expect unique adaptations from life originating on such a planet? 

Tails that drag behind you are unlikely to be tripped over while chasing something. If that thing gets behind you, causing you to turn around, it has already demonstrated that it is faster or more agile than you are and is going to get away anyway. Yes, there are probably events where the predator needs that maneuverability, but they should be edge cases. You could offset the lost prey percentage by heightening one of their senses vs. a regular fox. With that said... I think it is interesting that I cannot think of another mammal with a hairy tail that allows its tail to drag on the ground. Cats (big and small), dogs (big and small), horses (and related animals), etc. all have hairy tails, but those tails are either short enough to avoid the ground or are held aloft as the animal moves. This suggests that having 9 tails as described would create a host of other issues that are not in your animal's best interest. Dragging your tail on the ground while walking would get it COVERED in crud all the time. Dirt, mud, algae, moss, fecal matter, bugs, parasites, and any amoeba etc. This would make it highly susceptible to infection and substantially increase its mortality rate; so much so that I would be surprised if a number of parasites DIDN'T adapt specifically to inflict themselves onto this particular animal. If the tails were cleaned regularly in the typical animal fashion (licking), from a hygiene perspective your fox might as well run with its tongue out licking the ground for all the crud it's going to ingest. If not cleaned, the tails would quickly take on a LOT more weight and add considerably more drag to your animal - slowing it down and making it less capable as a predator.
