Not in general, although there may be some classes of algebras where it holds. For a simple counterexample $A$ consider the path algebra (over an infinite field) of the quiver $$1 \stackrel{a, b}\Rightarrow 2 \stackrel{c}{\rightarrow} 3$$ modulo the relation $ca=0$. This algebra has global dimension 2, so in particular the subcategory of modules of finite projective dimension is all of $A$-mod, which is contravariantly finite. However, the simple module $S_1$ has no right-approximation by a module of projective dimension $\leq 1$, so $P_1$ is not contravariantly finite. Informally, one sees there is a one-parameter family of nonisomorphic indecomposables with dimension vector (1,1,0), each of which (with one exception) has projective dimension 1, and maps onto $S_1$. Then one can check that there is no single finite-dimensional module of projective dimension 1 through which all of these maps can factor. I believe that one can make this argument more rigorous (but I haven't checked the details) by using the fact that this algebra $A$ is stably equivalent (by constructing a node) to the algebra $\Lambda$ studied by Igusa, Smalo and Todorov in their paper "Finite projectivity and contravariant finiteness," Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 109 (1990), no. 4, 937-941. 

Yes, any indecomposable projective-injective $A$-module $P$ is (isomorphic to) a direct summand of every tilting $A$-module $T$. Just check that $T \oplus P$ is also a tilting module, and then use the fact that any two tilting $A$-modules have the same number of isomorphism classes of idecomposable summands. 

I believe this answers your question, although it may not be that enlightening. Basically, you can rephrase the existence of a faithful semisimple $R$-module in category-theoretic language as follows. First, an $R$-module $M$ is faithful iff $M$ is a cogenerator in $\mbox{Mod-}R$ for the subcategory of (finitely-generated) projective modules; i.e., for every nonzero map $f : P \rightarrow P'$ between projectives $P$ and $P'$ there exists a map $g : P' \rightarrow M$ such that $gf \neq 0$. Thus the ring $R$ is semiprimitive iff $\mbox{Mod-}R$ contains a semisimple object $M$ that is a cogenerator for the subcategory of projective objects. 

The theorem would still apply in the characteristic $p$ case, but as suggested in the question, it would not follow that the center of $D$ is finite-dimensional over $F$. Edit: Kaplansky's paper can be found here: $URL$ 

I believe I had this exact same question some time ago. Auslander and Reiten attribute this result to a paper of Auslander and Green. I still have the latter paper, but can no longer find where this result is in that paper. From my old notes, it looks like I concluded that this proposition is misstated in Auslander and Reiten's paper. Most likely, they may have meant to write "strong tilting module", rather than strong cotilting module. In your example of $A=kA_2$, the strong tilting module is $DA$, and this contains all simple $A$ modules (as submodules) on both sides. Alternatively, for strong cotilting modules, I believe the proper statement is the dual that every simple $\Gamma^{op}$-module is a quotient of $T_{\Gamma}$. If you want to see a proof of the statement for strong tilting modules, see Prop 7.1 in the paper $URL$ 

This question is addressed by the paper Wild categories of periodic modules (Illinois J. Math. 32 (1988), no.3, 557-561) by Jon Carlson and Alfredo Jones. As suggested by the title, the answer to your question is that the $2$-periodic modules can usually not be classified. In particular, the authors consider the very simple case of $G = (\mathbb{Z}/p)^2$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $p\geq 7$. For such $G$, they construct a wild subcategory of $2$-periodic modules. For larger $p$-groups $G$ of wild representation type, one can induce the $2$-periodic modules of a rank 2 elementary abelian subgroup $E$ up to $G$. Induction is exact and preserves $2$-periodicity. Technically this doesn't prove that the $2$-periodic $KG$-modules form a wild subcategory, since induction does not preserve indecomposability; but it does suggest as much, and at least shows that one should expect many $2$-periodic modules. 

Yes $D$ must be finite-dimensional over $F$. This follows from a Theorem of Kaplansky's that I found in Herstein's monograph "Noncommutative Rings". The first step is to show that an algebraic algebra of bounded degree satisfies a polynomial identity (see Lemma 6.2.3 in Herstein), i.e., is a P.I. algebra. Note, however, that the degree of this polynomial identity may be larger than the degree of the algebra, as defined in the question. Then since a division algebra $D$ is primitive, one can use: 

For a locally compact group $G$, we define the Pontryagin dual as $\hat G = Hom(G,\mathbb T)$ where $\mathbb T$ is the circle group and the homomorphisms are continuous group maps. This duality has a lot of nice properties and shows up all over the place so it is probably the right definition. However, without the benefit of hindsight, why would one choose to define the dual of a group with respect to $\mathbb T$ (instead of some other locally compact group, say). Is there a reason to promote $\mathbb T$ to a special place among all locally compact groups? A little more broadly, are there other groups $H$ that also lead to a good theory of duality if we define $\hat G_H = Hom(G,H)$? One possible answer would be to explin the historical context/necessity which led to the definition. But there can also be other motivations and I would be open to both kinds of answers. On a closely related note, one can also ask a similar question for the Cartier duality in algebraic geometry. Probably, the two will have similar answers. 

Let $R$ be a DVR with uniformizer $\pi$, fraction field $K$ and residue field $k$. Let $X/K$ be a Severi-Brauer variety and $\mathscr X/R$ a smooth, projective model of it. Is it true that $\mathscr X_k/k$ is also a Severi-Brauer variety? What if we only assume that $\mathscr X/R$ is smooth and proper? One way to try and prove this would be to show that if $X$ is trivial as a Severi-Brauer variety, then $\mathscr X \cong \mathbb P^n_R$ over $R$. Is this true? (Note: I asked this a few hours ago on mathstackexchange but on the suggestion of someone, I am posting it here. I have deleted the stackexchange post.) 

Let $K = \mathbb Q(\mu_m)$ and $\zeta_K$ it's Dedekind zeta function. We know from the class number formula that, around $0$: $$\zeta_K(s) \sim s^{r_1+r_2-1}h(K)R(K)/w(K) $$ where $h,R,w$ stand for the size of the class group, the regulator and the size of the subgroup of roots of unity. On the other hand, we have the decomposition: $$\zeta_K(s) = \prod_\chi L(s,\chi)$$ where the product is over suitable Dirichlet characters and moreover, $L(0,\chi) = -B_{1,\chi}$ - the generalized Bernoulli numbers. On the other hand, $R(K)$ should not be algebraic and there should be a corresponding transcendental contribution from $L(0,\chi)$ and the explicit formula for $B_{1\chi}$ shows that this comes only from those $\chi$ such that $L(s,\chi) = 0. $ Question 1: In the case that $L(s,\chi) = 0$, is it possible to say what the first non zero Taylor coefficient is? Question 2: Can we decompose (even if it is only conjecturally) $h(K),R(K),w(K)$ into factors corresponding to each Dirichlet character appearing in the decomposition of $\zeta_K$ . What about the order of vanishing of $L(0,\chi)$? 

I am reposting the second question from here (after clarifying it) on the recommendation of user "GH from MO". Let $b_1,b_2,\dots$ be an enumeration of $\mathbb Q$. Question 2: Suppose I define $$G(x,y) = a_0(y) + a_1(y)(x-b_1) + a_2(y)(x-b_1)(x-b_2) + \dots$$ where the $a_k(y)$ are polynomials in $y$ and $g(x) = G(x,x)$. Suppose the $a_k(y)$ are not identically zero for $k$ large enough. Otherwise, we clearly get polynomials. Is this the only way to get a polynomial? That is, if $g(x)$ is equal to a polynomial function, then is $a_k = 0$ for $k \gg 0$? 

Does anyone have a table of the class numbers ($h_n$) of cyclotomic fields (upto say, n = 250-300 for $\mathbb Q(\mu_n)$)? I can find tables for the relative class number ($h_n^-$) in various places like Washington's book and I can also find tables for class numbers of $\mathbb Q(\zeta_p)$ for $p$ prime. However, I am really interested in the class numbers for $n$ composite and I don't seem to be able to locate any. Probably someone with better googling skills could locate it... Sage also takes too long to calculate class numbers after a point. Alternatively, are there any results known on what $h_n^+ = h_n/h_n^-$ can be for the range $n \leq 300$? I would appreciate it if the table were in a format where I could easily copy paste from.
