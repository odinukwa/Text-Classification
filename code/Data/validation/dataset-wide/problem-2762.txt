something should presumably have to replace the question-mark against all logical possibility. And then even if something did replace it against all logical possibility, humans are at most right now merely demigods compared to dogs. Might this put a substantial hitch on some theoretical maximum of intelligence? Update 1 2014-10-17: While no one has pointed this out yet, during my discussions so far I realized that the frame of mind at around the time of generating this curiosity could readily concede to "The analogy breaks down if superintelligence (including up to hyperintelligence) necessarily must originate from at least as low as human-level intelligence." ... As a corollary, this doesn't bode well for traditional conceptions of God. Update 2 2014-10-17: Responder @ChrisSunami points out that a hunter-gatherer tribe 10 thousand years ago would not have a maximal ontology [in the relevant sense]. Since the main analogy broke down from Update 1, and in light of this hunter-gatherer point, a new analogy becomes forthcoming. 

By assuming the negation of the conclusion, you arrive at a proposition that contradicts a true premise. (We assume our premises are true when the validity, and not the soundness, of the argument is in question. If the soundness were in question then we would also want to know if the premises really are true, but the soundness is not in question right now.) If ~B leads to a contradiction, then it must be false. In classical logic, if ~B is false then B is true. What if we have all true premises and don't arrive at a contradiction by the same method? 

It can be done in one step. The first man sees two white hats and says that he knows. But, you say, the problem says that the first man says "I don't know"? Exactly. The problem's definition is also specified by the second man saying "I don't know." Therefore, if you can break the definition of the problem for your two steps, I can break the definition of the problem for my one step. ... 

I can see the power behind the argument because to get around it a person would either have to stretch the imagination into areas that might seem implausible or have to solve a lot of academic problems, if the person is to be satisfied that Mary has all the facts and that all the facts are physical facts. Foregoing the route of solving a lot of academic problems for now, I think we can continue to think about Mary in a way that derives directly from your formulation, RECURSIVE FARTS. The original Mary is characterized with the standard scientific kind, as having descriptive knowledge. If it's implied that she has procedural knowledge, which standardly tends to be an engineering kind, it's not very much. In domains where descriptive knowledge is enough, interfacing with things around you tends to be enough. You don't need to begin an approach to knowing the inner workings of things to the extent of knowing how to reconstruct them or something like them. That is, you don't need to begin an approach that's pointed to knowing things in themselves. At most, you'd need to know enough to create simulations, which, while a lot of times very sophisticated, is not the same. But descriptive knowledge isn't always enough in all domains where physical knowledge is required. Additional knowledge is required to assemble basic components (which are usually for larger systems). Without getting into whether or not Mary has the "right kind" of knowledge about colors, we can already say she lacks some physical knowledge. That is, she doesn't know how to assemble basic components. Or, at least, she doesn't have the facilities to assemble basic components and gain the knowledge of herself going through the process of assembling the basic components. Indeed, this would be just like you said, this would be a posteriori knowledge, RECURSIVE FARTS(). Now that we may begin to question the sobriety of the original caricature of Mary, we may be able to close in on settling the issue. Even letting alone the question of the life-changing subjective quality of strolling through the wilderness, we know that as it stands Mary neither has enough knowledge ab intra nor has enough knowledge a fortiori. However, provided proper education and further facilities, whether industrial or surgically integrated with her body, she would simply demonstrate her sufficiently complete knowledge of the physical world. First she would make basic nanoconstructors. Then she would make physical replicas of everyday inanimate objects. Then she would make physical replicas of archaea. (...) And finally, for now, she would give you a neural implant to complement hers for bidirectional communication of art works and anything else that could be seen in virtual reality. Of course, the tests she had to perform to get such magic right must've involved having knowledge of the physical world to such a degree that it went much beyond descriptive knowledge, and into its superset of acquaintance knowledge. Having physical descriptive knowledge is simply not the only kind of physical knowledge to have. 

I would think that this argument will be very ill received because it criticizes revisit principles of religion. In the big Abrahamic religions a set of rules have been written down, in some cases to prevent the spread of diseases, the prohibition against pork in Judaism and Islam, in other cases to control a population, the burka or niqab i Islam. Eventhough Jesus sought to get rid of these rules the church later created Hell and imposed decency and good manners. In all religions springing from Abraham a certain criticism of the free speech have later been developed. An example of this is the Muhammed drawing by Kurt Westergaard. Here islamic leading figures required an apology from the state of Denmark, the newspaper who printed them and the cartoonist himself, by referring to scriptures not allowing it, written in religious books. There are many examples in Israel where freedom of speech have been under attack by the Orthodox jews. A religious censorship has resurrected. Since religious books in many countries have strong ties with state policy, Iran and in some cases the US, I would see parts of the bible, the quran and other religious texts as being Authoritative. 

Then looking at knowledge one must look at the concept of knowledge: One Greek filosofer states that he knows nothing but this he knows: "I know that I know nothing" - Socrates. In other words: he realizes that every thing he bases his knowledge on is based on the knowledge of others. Just because one understands the line of thought dose not mean that it is true. "Why do I have two hands?" "Sow you can hold the bible you read" is a classic eksample because the question is answered with God. An other thought is: "I think, therefore I am" - Descartes In this understanding knowledge is simple a product of thinking because the pure knowledge som from this. Knowledge is not defined but relative to you. This is why "God" is needed, he defines your "ground state". Today information can be stored, meaning that a certain arrangement of electrons can lead to the storage of knowledge. To sum up: knowledge is matter of definition. 

Math and philosophy was in the acient Greece very connected and many times studied simultaneously as they where (and in some parts of the world still is) thought to coincide. This is because math describes the fundamentals of nature, it models the world around us to a degree that we, as humans, find satisfying. In the same manner philosophy concerns answers that cannot be mathematically measured, because the subject being studied is a question of emotion, lack of it, reason and sow on. Just because we are satisfied does not mean that math is completely true, math and philosophy are the only two non-empirical subjects in modern academia, which from a natural science perspective also means that it cant be proven and not to a full extend understood. Within math it is easy to make proves that is limited by a "false math" the bunny and the turtle is a classic. The bunny can never pass the turtle because thenever the bunny reaches the point the turtle has just left, the turtle has moved on to a new point and sow on. In this limited math, this is true, even though we know it to be false because our math includes time. We have accepted math to be true because it describes the world in a sensibly way, and it continues to do sow because math constantly develops. Matrices, Fourier transforms and quantum mechanics are examples of this. But we do not know, if all we know, is that the bunny cant pass the turtle. To answer the question, we don't understand math or fore that matter anything, but we can model it daim well, and this is "proof" enough fore us to believe in it. 

If one country (N_c) went to war against another, families (N_f) would unite to match the highest order of N. Even the very idea of family unites some and divide other, but in the case of being challenged by a group of higher N, the challenged group would rise in N. I think the magnitude of the N depends on the challenge to this magnetude. 

This is an excellent question, and I don't think Mattmark's answer is irrelevant at all. 'wherever' it is that humans live, our cultural-ecological niche is somewhere in the infinite regressions between the Actual and the Potential. I will return to this in a moment. In answer to the 'undiscovered skills' question, philosopher of technology Jaron Lanier came up with the interesting concept of homoncular flexibility to describe what he calls 'pre-adaptive biology'; that is, all the things we are 'wired' to do without knowing that we can do them. For example, all humans are physiologically capable of swimming, but those who live in an environment without bodies of water or knowledge of other humans who swim may never 'discover' that they can swim. Lanier first realized this while working with Jeremy Bailenson et al at the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction lab $URL$ where 'mistakes' in Avatar environment experiments enabled them to experience skills and forms of embodiment that they didn't think were possible (like being 'turned into' a lobster claw, or a triangle). In cognitive science, the modularists argue that we have an evolved 'language module', or a 'swimming module', or a 'cooperation module', etc. So from that perspective, we may not have fully-evolved modules for skills we haven't needed to practice yet. In this sense, it is a silly question to ask whether we posses a module for X, X being that-skill-which-no-human-alive-has-thought-about. But I think a cybernetic perspective is more interesting here, and we need to ask about, and experiment with, emergent properties of organisms and humans in different environments. From an object-oriented ontological perspectives, interacting with objects and tools also leads us to imagine and practice more skills - the kind of skills that 'exteriorize' some of our abilities (like storing our memories in written symbols, or increasing our movement abilities with bikes, cars, and planes), or require making objects an extension of our bodies. This is what Heidegger calls a 'readiness-to-hand' relationship with objects: when we drive, we are not consciously aware of how a car becomes an extension of ourselves; we are 'immersed' in or with it, or merged with the car. Archeologist Bjornar Olsen takes this notion farther and argues that 'objects remember'. He goes beyond the second-order phenomenological claim that memory is in the body (and not just in the mind-brain); like a body that 'remembers' how to ride a bike. He would say that here, memory is in the mind, the body and in the bike! (try riding a bike without a bike, he jokes, and you are left with the sound of one hand clapping). All this to say that our potential for new skills is not just in our brains (and certainly not just, as Lanier suggest, in unknown, but a priori cognitive modules), but also in the tools, objects, and world around us. The Inka had toys with wheels, but they hadn't "yet" invented the chariot. Humans everywhere built sails and kites before they figured out flying machines. Re: spoken language: inbuilt module or not, it is not something we are born with. Spoken language is a particular expression of our symbolic capacities, just like writing or painting, but it is a technology that is exterior to humans; the signs and symbols of spoken languages are stored in the memories of living humans (later tablets, papyri, books, and hard drives), but they die with humans, tablets, and hard disks! There are gesturalist theories (Michael Corballis) of the origin of language through hand-gestures ('sign-language is a pleonasm, since all language is the exchange of signs). Spoken language probably spread organically in some places, and diffusionally in others (like bows, arrows, and agriculture), and it is more than probably that some bands of paleo-luddites would have rejected it for a while (like people who intitally rejected telephones or facebook). Speaking with hand-gestures makes more sense in a predator-prey environment, in fact, and may be responsible for honing our symbolic skills for a very long time. Now back to the question of 'potential'. As symbolic creatures, we mostly interact with what is not actually the case on the one hand, and what could or couldn't be the case on the other. When we make sense of the world through languages and mental categories, we do this through symbols, and not the thing itself ( a name is not the thing named; the map is not the territory, etc.). We also project our minds (or Theory of Mind) into anyone and anything, all the time. Consider our capacity for agent-detection, which is basically an extrapolated Theory of Mind. We cry in movies (by projecting our feelings into non-existent agents), we see faces in the clouds, 'detect' predators in the shadows, and believe in all kinds of supernatural agents. Cognitive anthropologist Pascal Boyer argues that we cannot not believe in and interact with 'supernatural agents', because we are always projecting our ToM, thereby creating imagined agents that are not actually there. I would argue that as humans, we are potential agents a lot more than actual ones. So in terms of new skills, the sky is limit. My only concern is that the things we have built remember too much and do too much of the business of imagining at this point. Start with Plato's Phaedrus (how writing techology makes us forget), and read Tim Ingold on the history of lines and Michel Serres on the history of writing and memory to get a good sense how much potential we are also losing each time we outsource ourselves to things. Tim Ingold, unlike most other anthropologists, argues that we should think of knowledge and culture as skill: it is incorrect to say that 'culture is passed on from generation to generation', he proposes; instead, we should say that 'skills are regrown in each generation' through experimentation in the world. What happens to our ability to merge and experiment with the world when we leave most of it to objects? Consider language once more. You could ask if, at one point, we will develop a module for telepathic communication. In a sense, we already have. With non-spoken sign-language, our ancestors were already silently planting thoughts into each other's brains. Now with instant-messages, we also share symbols through entirely soundless communication. We do it for longer and we reach farther than our ancestors in that proverbial savanna, but our attention spans are much thinner, and we also rely on a chain of technology that none of us fully understands or could recreate on our own. In this sense, we have devolved, and our future generations will have less and less skills.
