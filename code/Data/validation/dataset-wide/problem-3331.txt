This pattern is very analytic. Instead of using prefixes/suffixes, Japanese uses independent words and particles in this case. The only thing that could be categorized as an agglutinative suffix is tachi (which is equivalent to Chinese 們 men). Of course, one could analyze particles such as no and ni as prefixes/suffixes, but this makes about as much sense as considering English of and at, or Mandarin 的 de and 在 zai as such. So, no, I would consider Japanese nouns as analytic. 

While Turkish nouns seem to be generally agglutinative, Japanese nouns are generally not. A rough translation of the above mentioned expressions into Japanese would be: 

I'm looking for a corpus of Asian American accents so that I might parse them and determine what phonetic/ phonological differences differentiate them from other American accents. By Asian-American accents, I'm thinking something like this, wherein the speaker is a US-born native English speaker with little to no proficiency in Chinese or another East/ Southeast Asian language, but whose parents speak the given East/ Southeast Asian language heavily in the home and whose L2 English itself is accented. The male speaker at 0:22 here would be a good example for a male Asian American accent. It's an oddly specific request, but I can provide more examples if there's difficulty determining what accent I'm talking about. 

The main difference according to my understanding is that in inflective languages, one usually declines, or change morphemes (which are closely integrated into the word) to inflect meaning of the word. In agglutinative languages, one append prefixes/suffixes to add meaning to a word - the word's stem is largely untouched. In analytic languages, those morpheme changes are largely absent - instead, one combines independent morphemes to convey meaning. However, few or none languages are purely inflective/agglutinative/analytic (isolating). Proto-Indo-European, and thus many Indo-European lanaugages, are heavily inflective. Romance languages are mainly inflective, but modern Romance languages have developed many analytic features as well (especially French). Mandarin Chinese is basically analytic, but it does have a few agglutinative features. Modern English is also mainly analytic, but it has some notable inflective features (e.g., what's left of verb inflections). Modern Japanese is both significantly analytic and significantly agglutinative. I don't think any answers have yet given examples of agglutinative languages, so I'll give some examples of the agglutinative features of Japanese. Let's take the Japanese verb 食べる taberu "to eat" as an example: 

I'm currently studying Japanese and Korean for professional reasons and have become very interested in Middle Chinese as the hearth of substantial vocabulary in many East Asian languages. Recalling my days studying Latin in high school, I've become interested in learning, or at least exposing myself to, Middle Chinese of c. ~1000CE but have found finding learning resources very difficult. Interest in learning such a language, however, presumptiously assumes the language has been fully reconstructed. While I'm certainly able to track etymologies of individual words to their Middle Chinese forms, see for example Example of Japanese's Borrowing from Middle Chinese, knowing isolated words is hardly satisfying. Can one learn Middle Chinese in the way one might learn Latin or Ancient Greek? How fully has the grammar, lexicon or syntax been recovered? Understandably, with no written texts and native speakers, this may be little more than an academic exercise, but for me, understanding the etymological context for Japanese and Korean vocabulary would certainly be worth the effort. 

The last argument to that command is a string, so the variable where you store it must be a string variable. This should work: 

Bonus: What does the error mean? The code you posted does not raise the error you reported (so I guess that comes from a previous version of your script). If you run the code as it is, it will die saying that the command does not exist. The upper-case tells the interpreter that what follows is a command name, which in Praat can have spaces and any other number of odd characters (as in ). If it were a lower-case the interpreter would expect a variable name, and also die. The error you got (about the unknown symbol) is raised if you surround in single quotes (), which tell the interpreter to interpolate the value of a variable. In this case, the "unknown symbol" is the variable, which will remain unknown (= you won't be able to define it) because it is illegal (it starts with an upper-case character and has a space in it). 

You could see that each suffix appended to the verb taberu does exactly one thing: -rareru expresses the potential to perform an action, -tai expresses the wish to do some action, etc. They are largely independent from the verb stem, but do not form independent words on their own. Comparatively, English is basically analytic: to convey the same meaning, one use independent morphemes like "able to" and "want" to modify "eat". While in a inflective language, it will be hard or nearly impossible to extract those morphemes out - not only because they are so closely integrated into the word stem itself, but also because it is simply not true that each prefix/suffix has one function. However, Japanese is heavily analytic in many other areas of its grammar, compared to languages generally considered primarily agglutinative (e.g., Turkish). I don't know any Turkish, but I saw this on Wikipedia: 

Quick question, and perhaps a natural extension of some of my previous questions. For the girl speaking here at 1:09, what phonetic and phonological characteristics of her accent, and how do they give it away that she is Chinese American? While she definitely has LA area intonation patterns, I don't think solely that comprises her accent, as I can certainly imagine caucasian speakers from LA speaking with that intonation. I feel, vaguely, there's something about her pitch being different on average, and perhaps something about her formants being broader(?), almost post-pubescent, if that makes any sense at all? If not, please just disregard this. 

My explanation is Japanese became tied up with kanji when it decided to introduce widespread usage of kun'yomi 訓読み, as opposed to Korean and Vietnamese which almost only have on'yomi, or loaned Chinese readings. Thus, it was made possible that native coined Japanese words would also have simple ideographic representations, making kanji conducive to comprehension, instead of an impedance. Instead of having to read the phonetic symbols みず mizu and まぼろし maboroshi, one can simply read and write the ideograms 水 and 幻, which are much more comprehensible. I am a native Chinese speaker, and I'm still almost unable to comprehend large amounts of Chinese transcribed into Pinyin. The same goes for reading Japanese without kanji. However, in Korea, few hanjas have native readings. Numerically, there are more Chinese loanwords than native words in both Korean and Japanese; however, the most frequently used words in both languages are almost all native. Thus, in Korean mixed-script texts, one sees much fewer hanjas than one do in Japanese texts. Moreover, since Korean is usually one syllable (hangul character) per hanja and has spacing between words, mixed script texts are very easily replaced by hangul-only texts, making hanja actually an impedance to reading comprehension. There were movements in Japan to abolish kanji, but there were also those movements in China - and it was much bigger than China (even backed by the PRC regime initially). However, due to the Chinese characters being extremely conducive in expressing meaning concisely and in disambiguating homophones, neither of the movements succeeded - leaving Chinese and Japanese to be the only languages to use Chinese characters in their standard written forms. 

The variations shimmer refers to are much smaller than what it looks like you are after. What you seem to want is most easily achieved with the command for Sound objects. You'll have to adjust the intensity thresholds, but it should do what you want. 

The presentation is not challenging "the existence of f0 itself". It is saying that tone is not just pitch (true) and that pitch is not just f0 (true). Tone, in the sense that is being used there, is a linguistic concept that is used as a distinguishing feature in some languages. Pitch is the perception of whether a sound (which could be non-linguistic) is "high" or "low", and this perception (like most of our other perceptions) results from a combination of things (one of which is the frequency of the sound). The problems the presentation raises are not with f0 per-se, but with the methods that are used to estimate (keyword being estimate) what that value is. Of course, that something is hard to measure correctly does not mean it is not "objective". That, I'd say, is a confusion of terms. Or put in another way: if f0 did not exist, which is what it sounds like you were left with, then how could the speaker know that in page 14 it was doubled? Doubled with respect to ... what? 

I'm a non-native English speaker at a California university absolutely fascinated by the variety of English accents I encounter in my day-to-day life. I have a co-worker with a Singaporean accent, for example, and hearing it in both her Chinese and English is just really cool. While I have some formal linguistics training and can hypothesize certain phonological rules governing my peers' accents, I was wondering if there exists any kind of encyclopedia or authoritative resource regarding the formal elements of the accents of non-native English speakers, or regional English accents. I'd like to have a more structured understanding of the accents around me, so that I might, for example, more precisely think about and describe my Mandarin speaking coworker's "abrupt" English, or the pitch structure in the sentences of my Vietnamese coworker, and be able to reproduce these accents myself (as an exercise, and to blend into certain communities when appropriate). I see plenty of anecdotal examples in introductory phonology texts, e.g., metathesis in AAVE, glottal stops in the L2 English of native Vietnamese speakers, etc., but is there a resource that compiles this information, such that I could search a particular language and it would provide phonological information?
