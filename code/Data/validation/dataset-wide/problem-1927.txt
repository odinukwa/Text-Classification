Be careful if you decide to tell you friend the reason. There are many legal requirements around hiring and almost every company I know of will not give you a reason for risk of being sued. If the company gets sued you will likely be terminated. Consider your risks first. Since you say you cannot share the reason publicly you likely do not want to share it with your friend and do not want to communicate it to your friend in a medium that creates a record. This should not prevent you from helping your friend for future interviews. It certainly can be done tactfully. 

Give respect to gain respect. This applies even in scenarios where you join a company at a senior position and have reports who have been working there for a while. As someone just out of school, accomplish what is thrown at you first and then look for additional opportunities. In a technology company, you might have to spend 5/6 months working on something before you start coming up with ideas that others have not considered previously. Work through the idea on your own, and then present to someone who is willing to listen. Use their assistance to sell the idea and credit them appropriately. 

It's usually wise strategy because you basically provoke them into finding out reasons why they've valuated your skills below their average. They will always find a reason why someone who already works (for X years) is more valuable and deserves better pay. Instead of comparing, concentrate on your value added and alternatives you have. A company has no reason to worry on how unhappy you are with the salary until you'll accept it anyway. Convincing them, you won't accept any offer under X because you can easily get that somewhere else is a good argument for them to reconsider giving you better deal. Unless it's too much for them to be profitable. Or they won't believe you and think you'll take anything whatsoever. Taking what you doesn't like, you risk only being unhappy. Playing high, you risk getting nothing (and sitting 3 months idle, getting much better job afterwards). 

is a bit of red light. It's basically saying you are more oriented in having fun than doing serious job and earning money. Some recruiters are able to deal with it, some are not, and are not willing to, and consider it childish. Your recruiter was obviously of the 2nd type. Of course if the money is not important to you, and you don't need a job quickly, and fun is very high on your priority list, you can just look further for another recruiter. There are some who are specialized with dealing with such 'hard cases'. However, must are not, so you should get used to such reactions. 

In my city there's this large company employing several thousand people, at which I've already worked before during a small period, and where I'd really like to be employed again for a number of reasons. Since it's a renowned place, it attracts between 300 and 600 applicants for every single job opening they post. I've quite good qualifications and experience, and I've been applying for a large number of jobs there in the last ten years (*). I've mixed feeling as whether I should mention this in my job applications, or it would be better to leave it out, and whether it would make any difference. Would that sound as very motivated to work at the company (making me stand out among the other candidates), or just as desperate/pathetic? (*) So far I managed just to obtain a 1-year contract, long time ago. 

As said in multiple answers, it is a bad idea to ask for a significantly lower salary. However, this is not true in two cases which have not been mentioned: start-ups and consulting companies. A start-up has often a (very) limited budget so it needs to save money, or simply cannot afford your market price. If your price is too high they'll pick without demur another candidate, less skilled but cheaper. For consulting companies, their revenue comes from the difference between what they get from the client and what they pay to the consultant. I've had my fair share of experiences with some that weren't much interested in the quality of the candidate and just wanted to go for the cheaper hire in order to maximize their profits. There are a few cases in which such a job can be worth pursuing, for instance to gain some experience, or to get out of an unemployment period while looking for a better job; just be forewarned that they're going to exploit you. 

If you haven't received any response from your manager after having communicated your higher expectation, it may be that you are not rated adequately highly on any of those axis, i.e. the company finds itself in a situation where they find the odds not un-favorable if you left. 

There is no answer here that can be given without the specifics of how you feel about the company you are at right now. Here are some questions for you to consider 

As someone who spent 6 months in a similar positions in technical roles about 6 yrs back these were my notes (a) Review how your colleagues in the developed nation have responded to suggestions from the developers in the developing country. Have their responses in the past set the developers you are working with on a path where they prefer to follow rather than question, let alone confront on an obviously wrong decision (b) Pair a developer in each country. I paired the best developer in the developing country with the best outside. This worked well as the best outside developer was respected and would advocate on behalf of the developer he was working with. (c) Cultural differences play a major role. One example I recall is developers from developing countries making suggestion and raising objections to suggested implementation details which seeming fall on deaf ears in the developed nations developers. It is the approach of raising an objections, developers in America were raised to accept and give direct critical feedback, developers in the developing country were not, these developers provided indirect feedback, which was construed as a minor concern rather than an objection. The developer raising the objection invariably felt their feedback was not valued, providing a negative feedback cycle. (d) Last, but most important, tread lightly. In your desire to help the developers in the developing nation it will be very easy to bruise a few egos of the developers in the developed nation. Finding the right balance will be a skill that you will have to acquire on the go. I am sure I can dig up more notes but these should serve as a good starting point. 

Of course you have right to deny any information to the recruiter, including even the profession you want to apply for, but you must be aware of the consequences. Your financial expectations are one of the most important factors, because they usually represent the position you can fit in. If you don't know how much you want to earn, how should recruiter know? How should she know if she should apply you for junior, middle or senior position, in first line? Most companies expect from recruiting companies candidate profiles that match their expected profile, and not someone who 'would like to be senior, but a junior would match as well'. Saying 

You've learned a hard way you need to read your contract instead of hearing what the recruiter is saying to you. The best way to protect you in the future is to stick to what is written and not what is promised. You've said you are working for outsourcing company. Your situation looks quite normal for such companies. They produce nothing, they earn money on lending people for companies that need them. Because they have no guarantee they will get some work for people they hire, they like to 'share' risk with their employees via not-so-decent fixed salary paid when 'in-house' and much more better money when you actually work for client. The 2nd one was what was promised to you, the problem is, getting work for client is practically independent from you. The good news, your company will do everything to get you work for client, because otherwise, even with lower salary, you are the pure cost. The bad news, no guarantee they will success and it's even not dependent on you. On the other hand, outsourcing often means better money, so many people accept that, even if for 2-3 months in year they sit in-house getting half-money or even no-money. In any case, you should always read contract before signing so not to be disappointed when not everything is so bright as HRman have said. 

A verbal offer has no meaning unless it's followed by a written contract shortly afterwards. In your case, the delay has largely expired. They're just wasting your time and playing with you by having you wait for so long. You have nothing in hand so far and it's very likely that this offer will never became real so I would advise you to take the other offer, even if it's not your dream job. It already happened me a couple of times in which my manager told me "yeah, we are going to renew your contract" (one time even he gave his word for it), with nothing in writing. To imagine how it ended is left as an exercise to the reader. 

The fact that you used the "spoiler tag" in your post to hide the content of your bumper sticker already says that you think it is (or might be considered) inappropriate. Whether your employer has the right or not of forbidding this kind of stickers is, IMHO, not the point. The point is whether you want to be a nice employee or you want to be pointed out as the one who picks fights at every opportunity. The best outcome for you (if you want to keep working there in a nice environment -- or, bluntly said, if you want to keep working there) would be to apologize, tell you employer you didn't realize it was so offensive, and rip the sticker off your car.
