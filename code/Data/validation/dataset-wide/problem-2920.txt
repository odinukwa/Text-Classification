Human existence does not as such harm the environment. Suppose there were only ten humans in the world. It is not the current level of population that harms the environment but the way in which we currently live. We do indeed cause harm to the environment at considerable risk to our own present and future well-being. But an environmentally-friendly economy and way of life could minimise if not remove the harm. It's how we live that harms the environment, not the size of the earth's population. It is not clear how much population growth the earth could sustain if we switched to an environmentally-friendly economy and way of life. 

The Bavarian Illuminati had no connexion with Luciferianism so far as I can ascertain, if 'Luciferianism' implies veneration of or respect for Lucifer. My immediate source is a review of Vernon Stauffer's New England and The Bavarian Illuminati : 

'The spirit of a child' : this isn't quite what Nietzsche says. He talks rather of 'how the spirit becomes a camel, and the camel a lion, and finally the lion a child' (TSZ, Cambridge : CUP, 2006, 16) - wie der Geist zum Kameele wird, und zum Löwen das Kameel, und zum Kinde zuletzt der Löwe. That aside, though it is no small point, on my free reading Nietzsche does not suggest that the lion, or the person and potential Übermensch, is to become childish (uncontrollable, irksome, easily defeated and readily upset) but childlike in the sense of regaining the freshness of a child's sense of possibilities, of freedom from preconceived ideas, and so able to create a new world unsoiled by the old values. I could be completely wrong but I seem to catch an echo of the famous verse in St Matthew's Gospel : 'Except ye . . become like little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven' (Matthew, 18:3). I have no religious line to push here - there may be no connexion. But 'Zarathustra' does have, as Erich Heller points out (see references below, 76), distinct touches of Biblical pastiche. The answer to your question is, then, if I am any near right, that only by recovering something of the child's attitude to life, its pure, unfettered openness to possibilities can a person create the new world of the Übermensch. By the way, I would add that I don't think that the Übermensch is childlike. Rather, only by becoming childlike in the ways I've described can a person achieve Übermenschlichkeit. He or she does not remain childlike after that state has been attained. Childlikeness is only the preparatory condition.

What do you mean by 1, what do you mean by 2, and what do you mean by +? This is really the key question here -- if you're just taking a naive view of numbers as 'objects that count how many things I have' (these are really cardinal numbers), then of course 1+1=2. If I have one object and I then gain another object I have two objects total, and we have picked the symbols 1 and 2 to represent these notions with the symbol + to represent the aquisition of more objects. But what if we are keeping track of the number of particles in a quantum system? Say we shoot 1 proton at 1 other proton at about 99% of the speed of light -- do we now have 2 protons? Not so! In particle physics we have found that if you produce enough energy to replicate a given particles rest mass and you confine the energy to small enough of an area, the particle can come into existence in exchange for the energy (this is a very rough outline). The particle collider over at CERN takes advantage of this fact to study some of the most fundamental physics in our universe by slamming two protons into each other* with a bunch of extra kinetic energy (hence 99% LS), at which point literally hundreds of new particles are created and tracked using magnetic fields and photomultipliers and many other complicated devices. So if 1 and 2 and 3 and so on are counting the number of particles we have and + represents putting them together with great force, then 1+1=500 or something like that. We could instead choose to use numbers for keeping track of the scalar quantity we call energy throughout the above process and argue that this number does indeed follow regular addition laws, but then you have specified entirely what you mean by 1 and 2 (and +)! This is really the heart of the answer -- 1+1=2 whenever the quantities you have defined to be 1 and 2 together with the relation + satisfy this equality. *the protons do not actually collide -- they are forced to within incredibly small distances of eachother, at which point vector bosons can mediate short range interactions between the momentum states of the protons to effectively produce a 'collision'. 

Because you would help them show that you are in no sense morally superior, giving up your values you pretend to hold higher than anything else if it fits you. Therefore it would help the cause of the terrorists. 

The point in dilemmata is the exclusion of a third way. Di = two, lemma = "premise, anything received or taken," from root of lambanein = "to take" (source). That is something fundamental to (ethical) dilemmata. You could always think of alternatives, but the point is to judge a situation that is a dilemma, which is essentially a situation which cannot be solved in a moral way. See for example: Hare, Richard Mervyn: Moral Thinking. Its Levels, Methods and Point. Oxford/ New York 1981 Donogan, Allan: Consistency in Rationalist Moral Systems. In: The Journal of Philosophy 81.p. 291-309, 1984. 

The question is therefore here for "conditions under which alone something can be [...] thought as object in general": 

In essence, the criticism is detailed and spread over a couple of works. It is quite impossible to nail it down in a few paragraphs in its entirety without losing much of the good content produced over the decades on that topic. One of the more detailed ones with both acceptable length and detail can be found in form of the title-giving essay of Henrich, D., & Förster, E. (1997).

I'm going to go against the grain here and say that no, there is no coherent sense in which science necessarily depends on philosophy in and of itself. By the definition of scientific pursuit, when science has become sufficiently robust we will not need philosophy or religion to understand any facet of reality that we encounter. We will simply design an experiment that allows us to test conjectures about the behavior of the facet under consideration, confirming or denying various properties of it until we have answered our question empirically. Physics today is very far from being able to do this for questions like "what is consciousness", "what is the mind and how does it differ from the brain", "where does the law of gravity come from", etc., but it is an error of pride to claim that because we currently require philosophical conjectures to patch over scientific ignorance we will always need these philosophical patches (even if we cannot currently conceive of a way to do science non-phenomenologically). It is possible that the nature of reality and its link to our consciousness fundamentally precludes us from being able to answer certain questions, but we are nowhere near being able to claim this with any certainty. If we do reach such a point we could reasonably say that our understanding of science requires some philosophical conjectures, but I still believe it is incoherent to claim that science itself depends on philosophy. 

To put it in Hegelian terms: Geist would be dead if it would not be able to recreate itself in new ways all the time; it would be the end of history. This strongly suggests that there are no limits, even if we cannot conceive a limitless knowledge and are trying to "perhorrescate" [perhorreszieren]*, that is limiting/determining all the time, working against the movement of the subject. *Preface of the Phenomenology of Mind, original pagination p.19 

The trick with the Categorical Imperative is that it represents an objective end qua being rational, i.e. every rational being does have this end necessarily in every action. That is why it is universal. And the whole Groundwork, but especially the third section, basically tries to justify this claim. Part 2: Why do we want to get rid of them, then? The short answer is: Because we want to be moral and the very concept of what it means to judge morally means that we want it to be universal, i.e. that every rational being has to agree if they think it through. This is indeed one of the stronger arguments of Kant and the basis of his whole analysis of moral judgements: We indeed, when judgeing morally, do not think of it as a subjective or relative judgement. We think that this is right. We feel that this is how it should be, even though we may err, and that every being in its right mind should agree. The Groundwork merely looks for the conditions under which this kind of judgement would indeed work without incoherences. The long answer is veeeery long and takes about 20% of the Groundwork, all arguments considered. But the basic idea is that it is respect [Achtung] that makes us feel being of a higher order and transcending the shackles of our ordninary worldliness. Thinking about morality, we realise that we can try to be part of this higher order of absolute value by being rational, and therefore we long for being part of it and being up to what constitutes our dignity, even if we may never achieve it:
