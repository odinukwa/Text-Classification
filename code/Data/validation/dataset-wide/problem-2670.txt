(ONLY IF) (P) (is perceived) then (Q) (IS A MUST) (be perceived) = (ONLY IF) functions (are perceived) then existence (IS A MUST) (be perceived) = "ONLY IF there are perceiving functions, then there MUST BE perceiving existence" 

The problem is, when we are treating a proposition to semantic level, there will be paradox, contradiction or ambiguous. But if we consider a proposition, a statement must be related to reality, then hope we can understand something clearly and lead away from confusion, as a start to put something at the correct placement to avoid confusion. 

If this kind of relationship can be constructed nicely, it will be a mutual relationship to both. Both will gain assertions, corrections and possibilities wider and wider (applicable knowledge) than before, from both (philosophy and science), one to another. 

If there are times, then there are changing continuously without moving anything. Consider when we are watching movie. The story in a film represent sequences and we will see time differently, but there was nothing moving out of television. All artists were playing within display. If somehow we put consciousness inside the film on specific artist (just like dubbing), then the artist suddenly would realize that there was time stuck on a movement. But people outside the box (we were watching) knew that there was no movement 100 meters jumped out of display. The display may stand still, and the liquid inside the display was still there. We saw time within a film. We saw different times, but according to the player (DVD or VCD player), there was only one time for all actions on a film. One time with consistency. From within a film there was different time, different speed, but from outside the film, there was (closer to only) one time, (closer to only) one speed. It's like changing a specific binary number one at a time continuously and it will change the whole story continuously. It's like rolling a binary number once or multiple times for one or all events. All events are changing at one time continuously. If we can "pause or play" all events, then "one click for all events", one click again to change to different set of all events. 

Well, as for the ultimate answer as to whether the case you propose (after update 1) is moral or immoral: it will depend on the choice of moral system. A very popular system these days is consequentialism: the only thing that matters are the consequences. Thus, after update 1, a person who only looks at the consequences of an action to judge its morality will say that the actions of your protagonist are moral: one 'bad' person died, many innocent people lived to continue enjoying their lives, and your protagonist got to experience the joy of killing that he so much desires. Thus, the "utility" in this scenario is greater than the "utility" in the alternative scenario. You are comparing, in other words, the balance of joy in the following two scenarios: a) One man dies. This is a negative --- yes, he was bad, but he would still enjoy life, especially if he got to blow people up. Also, whatever enjoyment he got out of blowing people up gets lost, so that is another negative. On the other hand, however, your protagonist got to kill someone, and clearly that is a positive amount to add to the joy account; depending on how much joy he derives from killing the bomber, this might even compensate for the joy lost when the bomber died and no longer got around to blow people up. Also, thousands of innocent people got to continue living. Assuming that, on average their life was more enjoyable than not, this contributes a rather large positive amount of joy to the accounting. If, on the other hand, your bomber was specifically targeting sad people whose lives were not worth living (in a lot of consequentialist accounts you can have lives not worth living), then the fact that your bomber doesn't get to blow these people up contributes a large negative balance to the joy account. b) The bomber lives. The amount of joy that he derives of his life (blowing people up included) gets added to the joy account. Your protagonist doesn't get to kill anyone. The amount of frustration that he experiences because of this lack gets added to the joy account (obviously, as a negative number). And thousands of innocent people get blown up. Again, assuming that their lives were, on average, joyful, this adds a large negative number to the joy account. And the loss and sadness of the relatives and friends of these innocent victims also gets added (if it is loss and sadness --- perhaps some of them are happy with the deaths!) . Assuming that the victims were, on average liked, this adds a very large negative amount to the joy account. If on the other hand, the innocent victims had lives not worth living (in whatever accounting of joy you are using) and, on average, their friends and relatives preferred them dead, then the fact that they were blown up adds a large positive number to the joy accounting. Anyway, some kind of reckoning like the foregoing must be made if you are a consequentalist. You add up all the joy, subtract all the pain, and see which number comes up higher. On the other hand, there are other systems of morality out there. For comparison, let's look at a very traditional one. In this traditional one, an action's morality depends on 3 things (and the action must be moral according to all 3 criteria): 1) The action itself. Some actions are automatically immoral. 2) The intentions of the actor. 3) The circumstances surrounding the act --- including possible consequences. A very brief explanation follows. As for (1): This very traditional system maintains that there are actions that are automatically immoral, regardless of consequences. For example, to kill an innocent person on purpose would be an immoral act, regardless of consequences or circumstances. In your example, the mad bomber's actions would be immoral given that he is killing innocent people (yes, even if their lives are full of pain and suffering). Your protagonist would not be acting immorally according to this criteria alone, since he is not killing an innocent person. As for (2): This is where intention comes about. In this traditional system, if an action which is otherwise moral is done with bad intentions, then the action becomes immoral, again regardless of circumstances and consequences. A bloodthirsty desire to kill people is generally considered a bad intention. Thus, in your example above, your protagonist is acting immorally. Yes, even if he ended up saving people by his actions. However, if his intention were to save the people that the mad bomber intended to blow up and for this reason killed him, then his actions would be moral. As for (3): This is where circumstances and consequences fit in. In this traditional system, if an action is otherwise moral, but is performed in the wrong circumstances or despite foreseeable bad consequences, then the action becomes immoral. For instance, drinking alcohol would not be bad in itself; and it could be done with good intentions (such as enjoying a good cup of wine). But if one drinks a lot of alcohol while or right before driving, then one's drinking become immoral, because one puts other people at danger given one's actions. In your example, your protagonists' actions had good consequences. So your protagonist's actions pass the requirement that consequences & circumstances should not 'spoil' a moral act. Therefore, in the very traditional moral system I delineated, your protagonist would have acted immorally, since his intentions were immoral --- requirement (2). This very traditional system makes a distinction between the morality of a given act and the consequences of said given act (though the consequences are definitely considered as part of determining the morality of the act). In this system, all the following possibilities can happen: (i) an act can be moral and the consequences of the act good; (ii) an act can be moral, but have terrible consequences --- provided that the bad consequences were not willed and cannot be stopped ---; (iii) an act can be immoral and have beneficial consequences, at least in part --- your example above might be one such example; or (iv) an act can be immoral and have terrible consequences. And there might be other morality systems out there against which to judge. I am partial to the very traditional one I delineated here myself. Others have different preferences. 

If we are aware of something, then we perceive differences. When we are feeling of something, we are not perceiving differences, but we are focusing on something. For example, when we are thinking, we need to aware of something, we need to perceive differences to make a better comparison. When we are drinking, there is less thinking activity here, there is mostly no perceive differences, but there is mostly focusing to feel what we drink. We need to perceive differences to keep something (for example, hold the glass), but mostly we do focus when drinking (to taste something). Since perceiving slower time, fastest time and make a comparison, those are related to perceiving differences. Therefore our present are as long as we are focusing on something. The more we can focus on something, the more we stay within present. But once we perceive differences (we are not focusing on something), then our present become past and we experience new present as long as we can maintain our focus on something. 

The system to solve infinite regression can be provided by simple understanding about existence dependency. 

If there is intentional, then there is strong desire that can be detected by our consciousness. Whether it can be detected by: 

(All)P then Pr = All(cd1) <- (c1) (If there are all propositions, then, those are provable) (several)P then G = several(cd1) -> (cd2) (If there are some propositions, then, several of propositions are typical G) G then Pr = (cd2) <- (c1) (If some of propositions are typical G, then, those are provable) 

Answering "how many dimensional can be focused on?" The more surfaces with different dimensional can be focused on, the more something can be considered having more consciousness (specific feeling with more intense). Answering "how close for something can be focused on?" The closer for the surfaces with different dimensional can be focused on, the more something can be considered having more consciousness (specific feeling with more intense). 

(ONLY IF) (there is implementing a Bi-Conditional using "OnlyIF-Must"), then (there MUST BE) (there is the need, indication) (Stating a Bi-Conditional in plain English) 

There is no way for us to understand completely (essentially) selfless except by understanding that completely selfless must assert "no connection to our thinking and our emotions". Essentially (without our consciousness): 

Often times people who have a personality that compels them to think, however noble the act of thought might be, shall find in odd moments that they are in a desperate way. I had a bit of an epiphany a couple of months ago that there is a right and wrong way of being right. It is not so much the possession of truth that matters; it is the way that you go about carrying that truth, or if you feel that you have not yet discovered it, the way you go about handling that fact. All in all, life is about having an adventure. And to do this, you have to come to a point where you can accept that there are some things that you cannot understand. At this point it is important that instead of giving into despair, you come to terms with this fact, and play the game of life anyway. It is natural to spend our teenage years disillusioned with the structures of society. This attitude often finds its way in even matured individuals. Our culture propagates messages of individualism and rebellion. But I think that when you are at peace with yourself you begin to find that a large part of who we are consists in what humanity is. Instead of looking at your neighbor and judging them to be a part of some dull collective, we should begin to look at our neighbor and marvel that they are quite like us, despite the worlds of difference that we think exists between us. Compassion and love are the truest signs of a healthy person. I would suggest to you that instead of focusing on whether your thinking is harmful or not (which is a pursuit that, ironically enough, is still dictated by an obsession with thought), take a walk through some parks and speak with people you would not normally speak to. In short, have an adventure. 

Ever since the "linguistic turn", philosophers have been keenly aware of the need of analyzing certain questions about language. In retrospect, John Searle, in Expression and Meaning, notes "the philosophy of language is a branch of the philosophy of mind; therefore no theory of language is complete without an account of the relations between mind and language and of how meaning is grounded in the more biologically basic intrinsic intentionality of the mind/brain." Searle seems to be saying this: talking about facts of language presupposes commitment to facts about the psychology of humans who are language users. An argument for this conclusion could be along this thread: 

You can't put outside human in this case. Since human is the central point to be considered as a sample which we can find an evidence of awareness, will power. Our awareness, intelligent and will power must come from another bigger awareness, intelligent and will power, those are not less(!!!) than ourselves, however that is. 

New creation (new form or new function) asserts a causal chain Infinite backward asserts new creation (new form or new function) 

I try to explain from different direction. See if we can put "time" at the correct understanding. And see if we can put any other understanding (speed of time, etc) relevantly related to the understanding of THE NATURE OF TIME. There are different time that are perceived through comparison. But, there is (closer to) one time, (closer to) "no different times" that are perceived through comparison, by comparing to the movement of (closer to) the root of all particles. Where all events are framed, and stuck on the consistency of the beats of rhythm of pulses of (closer to) the root of all particles. One time for all events, one step for all events, more steps for continuing all events. 

Our domination within boundaries is strongly dependence to our ego. Each time our ego is being threatened, then our domination is being threatened. And our ego have ability to push ourselves to dominate as far our own available functions (potential) that can be realized without obstacle. If our ego are being threatened and this threat restricts our ego to release our functions as human, then ourselves will try to find something better to support our functions as human. If our ego was failed to dominate, further our Id will not be satisfied, and we need another chance (freedom) to fulfill our needs There must be better synchronizing in between our functionality as human and something to support ourselves. Without this, our domination will be threatened easily, and our ego will be threatened, further our freedom (to fulfill our needs) will be restricted. 

I am aware, it means i perceive difference. I feel something, it means i am not perceiving difference, but i am focusing on something. I am aware is, when i am thinking, and i feel something is, when i am feeling of something without thinking. But indeed sometimes (mostly) we couldn't keep our feelings longer, and it will cause distraction and switched quickly from feeling of something to thinking about situation (supported by aware of something, perceive differences) to maintain what we are doing (feeling of something itself). We may guess that feeling will involve thinking, but actually it won't. We just have to think deeper, strictly and see the border that may be very thin. "I am aware" has nothing to do with focus. I am aware and it's merely part of our thinking that active to aware from one point to another point to see the differences. If we thought that while we were aware of something also we felt of something (aware = focus), it's wrong (aware is not focus). What really happened was, that we did, comparing, and (quickly) after that we switched to feeling (focus on something) and this will make us looks like thinking & feeling of something that is equal to aware of something, but it's wrong. Aware of something (perceive to be) may be asserted as, "i perceive differences to be felt", and i feel something (perceive that) may be asserted as, "i perceive it without proceeding comparison".
