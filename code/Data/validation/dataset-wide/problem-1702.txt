If I ping a VPN address from the Smoothwall box, it works. However, when I try to ping a VPN address from any other host on the local 192.168.65.0/24 subnet, I get a "Destination Port Unreachable" result. If I set a route on the local host to send VPN traffic directly to the 192.168.65.160 gateway, that works. It's only when I try to route VPN traffic through the Smoothwall box that it doesn't get through. What's going on? 

Just set up a VirtualHost for my.drupal.com and configure its DocumentRoot to point to the directory in which you've installed Drupal. Then configure an Alias inside that DocumentRoot to point /vislab to the root location of the static content (which is in a separate folder from the Drupal files). Here's a brief example: 

What are you trying to accomplish with this? Why would you want the router to use the T5 LSA instead of the locally-configured static route? Do note that even though the router will use the static route in the routing table, it still knows about the T5 LSA in its OSPF LSA database. 

Again, if both providers are on a single router than redistribute into IGP isn't necessary -- the static will direct your edge router to always use the second ISP as long as the next-hop is reachable. As another poster mentioned, none of this will impact how the remote prefix reaches you. You'll need to do as-path prepending on your secondary link to try to influence this, but there's still no guarantee it's actually going to come in the path you expect. Hope this helps. -Keller 

Restart Postfix, and all your emails should then be copied to your script as well as delivered to the original recipient address. 

First, make sure you have a line in your /etc/apache2/ports.conf file. Then try changing to in your config. 

Also, in order for Kerberos authentication to work with ldapsearch, DNS must be properly configured for reverse IP lookups. If not, you'll get a "cannot determine realm for numeric host address" error. If necessary, you can put the IP and hostname of your AD server in your hosts file to get it working. 

Use the TMPDIR environment variable to tell mysqldump where to put its temporary files, and point it to a writable location. 

If you just want to know the number of messages sitting in the deferred queue, then the following should get you a quick answer: 

Anyone have a clue? I'm on RHEL 6 and 7 and everything else is fine (e.g. able to connect to hosts, etc.) Thank you! 

And that worked... but this is not ideal as we would prefer to have one script "Do it all". Obviously, putting that solution in this new script with will break as the script is ran from the management server, and it will attempt to remove the $INSTALL it gets from the management server, which doesn't even run this rpm... The following did not help: 

Assuming you meant you need to connect the 6 clients, WAP, and 2 printers on the 2nd floor instead of the first... Typically the way most enterprises would handle this would be: Service from telecom/ISP which terminates at the "Demarcation". From here your MDF (Main dist. frame) is built out (This sounds like your R1 and your two switches). From here you would connect IDFs (Intermediate dist. frames) by wiring through the walls and going into closets/server rooms. If the distance is <100m, you can run cat6 (though make sure you use the proper grade, e.g. plenum if in a plenum space) to the second floor IDF closet. From there, connect your 6 hardwired clients; the AP; and the printers. It can be as simple or complicated as you want. Many of the "Options" for what should be in your frames depends on your use case. Hope this helps! Edit: It should be made explicit that at the IDF you will want/need more infra. (e.g. another switch). Run the appropriate media from your MDF to IDF and within the IDF closet have a small racked switch that from there gets patched out to the AP, clients wall termination, printers, etc. Also, if this is your first time doing such work I would look into getting a contractor to consult with; plenty of people do this kind of work professionally and will likely be able to do it better than you could going in blindly - good luck! 

I've found that specifying "-O maxssf=0" on the ldapsearch command line is necessary in order for GSSAPI AD searches to work properly. The following command works for me to search the AD global catalog via a SSL connection: 

It sounds like you may need to configure the refint overlay, which helps to maintain a directory's referential integrity in situations such as that which you described. There is a page at $URL$ which may be helpful towards setting up this overlay. 

Rather than group your hosts by function, you could group them by role and have Ansible run a given role on a host only if that host is found in the designated group for that role. 

Make sure that the "mydestination" parameter in /etc/postfix/main.cf includes the "localhost" value. Add the following line to /etc/aliases. Run "postalias /etc/aliases" after editing is done. This is what actually passes emails destined for "robotscript@localhost" to your PHP script. Your script should be set up to read the contents of the email from STDIN. 

Depending on your requirements, you could also use RITE (Traffic Export). This will send target packets on one interface to a MAC address on another interface. $URL$ 

Depends on which link you're talking about, and what you mean by 'NIC teaming'. Assuming it's active/standby... 

It sounds like you're using class STP instead of rapid STP. Two options will speed up the convergence time significantly. 

The Cisco router can do 802.1q tagging without a problem. On your switch, you'll need to configure the router-facing port to trunk all the VLANs you want to use. Then, you can configure the router to recognize them on sub-interfaces. On your router: 

If this is the exact same model card in the exact same model router with the exact same IOS as you have working other places, you could have a hardware issue. Steal a module from another router that is known working. Does it work okay in the new router? If it does, probably an HWIC issue. If other HWICs don't work either, do you have any other models that you could try in the new router to see if the slot is possibly bad? 

There's no need to dump the password into an actual file. Just echo it with the -n flag to prevent the newline, then read it in from the STDIN file descriptor (/dev/fd/0) as follows: 

You can get a dump of the PHP environment by setting up a page with the following code and pointing your browser to it: 

If you set Apache to log via syslog and also use rsyslog to handle logging, you could configure rsyslog to send your logs to a file that's named according to the current date. That would eliminate the need to restart Apache, and you could easily rotate the older log files away. Check the following sites for more info: $URL$ $URL$ 

Putting login credentials into a command line like this is risky, as anyone who can view the process list could view those credentials. A better option is to put those credentials into an option file such as ~/.my.cnf and then reference that file in your command. 

Good afternoon all! long time lurker, first time poster here. I am trying to use a script to remove an rpm remotely (foo). There are too many hosts to efficiently do this manually. There are multiple versions of this *.rpm installed across the environment. So hardcoding the name in will not work. My solution, before, was to have a script that scp's a "removefoo.sh" to the remote host, with the following two bits inside: 

1: It most certainly is a desktop processor. The only iX processors to even touch Xeon tier would be the nicer 2011, 2011-v3, and 2066 i7's and i9's... but even then, they are basically just really nice "workstation desktop" CPUs. 2: An iX (especially an i3!) is not differentiated from a proper server chip (e.g. Xeons) simply by " no support multiple CPU's" on the same motherboard. That's bonkers. The chips (i3, i5, i7, i9, Xeons) are all a certain socket (e.g. 2066, 1155, etc.) and the amount of procs a board can handle has more to do with the board itself (e.g. dual socket 2011 boards, single socket 775, etc.). If they are implying that they have X socket (say 1156) motherboards and that the only difference between the Xeon options and this is that the "iX versions don't have multiple processors" on the board then that is big, big, BIG red flag. 

Your RewriteRule directive is looking for the URL to start with either a forward slash followed by "secure_secrets" or only by "secure_secrets" - you don't mention the "~user" part anywhere. 

Add the following line to /etc/postfix/transport. Run "postmap /etc/postfix/transport" after editing is done. This tells Postfix that emails destined for the "robotscript@localhost" address are to be delivered directly on this server, and not relayed elsewhere. 

Make sure to chmod the permissions to 0600 on that options file to prevent it from being viewable by anyone except the owner. Then your mysql command would be: 

This can be accomplished by using recipient_bcc_maps to BCC all emails to a local-only address that is configured to route to your script. Add the following line to /etc/postfix/recipient_bcc. Run "postmap /etc/postfix/recipient_bcc" after editing is done. This tells Postfix to BCC all emails where the domain matches "@yourdomain.tld" to the "robotscript@localhost" address. 

This should be applied to server interfaces. It will tell STP that there is no switch on the other side of this port, and that it is safe to skip the normal "safe" method of preventing loops. The port should move straight to forwarding. 

Enables the newer Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree protocol, which uses messages between switches to enable re-convergence within a couple of seconds rather than 30-45. You might try setting up a port-channel between your switches instead of redundant single links. This would allow all traffic to fail over to the remaining port if one is lost. 

log-input will cause the router to generate a syslog message every time the ACL entry is triggered, including the MAC address of the packet. For more detail, you could use "debug ip packet acl [detail]", which should be run with an ACL filter to keep it from cratering your router. Finally, you can do "debug ip packet acl dump", which is a hidden command. This will actually show you the full contents of the packets that match . Seriously un-recommend running this on a production router without a very specific ACL for a very small flow. The correct answer is to configure a SPAN port on the downstream switch that mirrors all traffic on the router port to a Wireshark (or similar) capture device.
