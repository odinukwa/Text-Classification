The Cristero War was fought in 1927 - 1929 between the Mexican Government and the rebels. The government wanted to abolish the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, while the rebels wanted to preserve it and their freedom to participate in it. The wiki article claims a strength of about 100k soldiers for the government and about 50k for the rebels (in 1929). This shocked me. At first glance that would imply that the government was twice as popular? Was the government just using mercenaries, or were the anti-church policies somehow more popular among the Mexican people? 

The wikipedia article for Vichy France has a pretty good map, a low-res version of which I'll put here: 

The Battle of Khalkin Gol took place in 1939 May - Sep and was the last border battle between Japan and USSR. It was a major victory for the Soviets. But the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact was not signed until 1941 Apr 13. What took so long? I would have thought Japan at least would want to secure the peace so it could hold onto Sakhalin, Kurils, and of course Manchuria. And it's not like USSR wasn't busy in Europe during all that time, e.g., the invasion of the Baltics and part of Poland as per the Molotov-Ribbentropt Pact, and the Winter War with Finland in 1939 - 1940. I'll also note the Soviet-German non-aggression Pact was signed in 1939 Aug 23, so I don't see why the Japanese didn't happen around the same time. I'll also note that Barbarossa didn't happen until 1941 Jun 22, so it's not like the Soviets waited until the war with Germany was underway to become desparate for securing peace in on their east border. 

It didn't give a date, but from the previous paragraph I inferred it was from 1940. I googled the name John T. Tate and surprisingly, could not find him. There were two "John Tate"s I found, one a mathematician and one a physicist (yes, both found on Wikipedia), but I couldn't find mention of them working on torpedoes. And then there's this: 

The Soviet Union had major food problems in the 1920's, what with the civil war and an attempt at forced requisitions. Their solution was the NEP, which used grain taxes instead of total requisition, and did state capitalism for the economy. Did Lenin or anyone else investigate greenhouses around this time? It seems enclosed greenhouses would allow food production anywhere in Russia, rather than relying on the grain belts and transporting huge distances. (In fact I remember reading about Khrushchev's agro-town concept in the late 1950's, though I don't know if those were proposed greenhouses.) It would require much more work to build, but if they successfully electrified the country in the 20's, I would guess they could build them. Instead, Stalin abolished the NEP in 1928 (and also re-instituted internal passports to tie the peasants to the land), and proceeded with total collectivization to support total industrialization very soon. 

Did people receive free electricity in their homes in the Soviet Union? If so, how was it rationed out? Were there any quotas on how much you could use? 

USSR was created Dec 30 1922. I could only find a list of 4 SSR's: Russian, Belorussian, Ukranian, and Transcaucasian. The Central Asian region was largely a part of Russian SSR, or RSFSR at this time. But it doesn't jibe with the map: 

Roman aquaducts are famous, but didn't the water freeze during winter? Where did the cities get their water during winter? EDIT: running water doesn't freeze as easily as motionless water, which leads to an important bit of info we need: how fast did the water run in Roman aquaducts? We might also need to know volumetric flow rate. EDIT 2: Of course rivers don't freeze solid. I know it's only a surface or skin of ice. However, once the surface freezes, how did they access the liquid water underneath it? How did they pump that into their aquaducts? 

Emphasis mine. The article has a cite for it too. So the first version was agreed to 1939 Aug 24. This version had Lithuania assigned to Germany. Then the second version was agreed to in September, with Lithuania assigned to USSR. Why the revision? Why so quickly? What prompted this change and why was it agreed to? I'll also note that this was before the Winter War (Soviet invasion of Finland, begun 1939 Nov 30) that proved so disastrous, so it's not like they traded Finland for Lithuania. 

Greenland was known to Europe since long before 1492. In fact, Lief Erikson reached modern Canadian lands around the year 1000, coming from Greenland. That journey was forgotten, but he chose a logical exploration path by starting from the west-most land known. So why didn't Columbus do the same? Seems a much bigger leap to try the mid-Atlantic first. Surely they knew, via dead reckoning and the like, the Greenland coasts were much more west than Portugal? In the summer and fall, the ocean around south Greenland should be ice-free enough to navigate. In fact, in the year 1500, Portugal sent someone to Greenland to find a Northwest Passage to Asia. Why didn't they do this first with Columbus? 

Just for comparison, California alone was producing a little more oil than the entire Soviet Union, and New Mexico was producing a little less than Romania. Source (Mineral and Industrial Production, page 147) I haven't looked in detail at other parts of the yearbook yet, but it appears it has many other industrial production listed state-by-state. I saw copper, zinc, and iron, for example. That's why I think this may be the goldmine I've been looking for for so long, and that's why I wanted to share this. 

It has a citation, some book reference that unfortunately I do not have. However, that was in 1938. What I want to know is for 1941 Jun 22. Ah, well, June 21 I guess. At this time, where was Germany getting its oil? How much oil did Germany have stockpiled? What money or resource did Germany use to purchase oil overseas? How many marine vessels did it have to import oil, including any captured from France? Were any of these vessels able to operate through the British blockade? Before I found that wikipedia statement, I had just assumed that Germany got all its oil from Romania, the USSR trade, and synthesized from its own coal. Also, that wiki statement is in relative terms. I'm hoping for absolute numbers in metric tons of oil. 

Tannu Tuva was a little country between Russia and Mongolia. This state became independent after the Russian Civil War, but rejoined the USSR as an autonomous republic on 1944 Oct 11. Why? Was this done voluntarily? And, very strange to me, why did this happen when the war with Germany was still ongoing? From what I read on the article, Tuva was already helping out by donating horses and wool blankets and other stuff. As far as I can tell there is not much in that land except mountains, pasture, and nomads with horses. I could not find the answer in the article or a google translate of the Russian version of the article. The closest thing I found through searching was this quora article that's more geared to Mongolia than Tannu Tuva. 

A slightly related question spawned this one. Sweden made a lot of ball bearings during WW2, which it exported to Britain and Germany. How many tons of ball bearings were imported from Sweden to Britain per year? How many tons was Britain manufacturing itself, and how many tons was imported from America? I found this pdf and looked through it, but does not provide a full answer. It only speaks in relative terms and financial terms. It even seems to contradicts itself, saying 31% of British ball bearings were from Sweden in the first page, but later down says "Direct wartime imports from Sweden provided about 15% of all British ball bearings." What we really need to know is how many tons of ball bearings were made in America and Britain. America was already convoying much stuff to Britain, and I suspect that if Sweden was totally cut off, American production could step up. 

How fortified was Cyprus during WW2? By that I mean how many Allied naval ships were defending it, how many aircraft and airbases, and how many troops with what equipment? The period I'm most interested in is summer 1940 to the end of 1941. So far I've found very little. Wikipedia does not have an article about Cyprus during WW2, and I could not confirm which port the British were stationed in. This article was interesting, but it only explained that the Battle of Crete was bloody enough to dissuade Hitler from hopping to Cyprus next. He probably didn't wanna delay Barbarossa any further anyway. Nevertheless, I would like to know how fortified the island was. 

That's written very anachronistically. If GNAT had been known to the US intelligence community on or before 1940, then I think it's safe the say the Germans had been developing it for at least a year. If Wikipedia is trustworthy, it goes back to 1933. So I'm here to post the question. Who "invented" it (conceived and developed it)? 

The map shows which territories were originally Vichy, and when they changed to Free French control (except for the yellow states in Southeast Asia, which came under Japanese control). However, it's missing two French Territories: Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy. The two skyblue islands you see in the Caribbean are actually Guadeloupe and Martinique. I would like to know if Saint Martin (the French possession, not the whole island) and Saint Barthelemy were originally under Vichy control, and when they came under Free France control. Who was governing them at the time and what statements did they make after 1940 June? 

During the Great Purge, a lot of military men were removed (executed, imprisoned, exiled, expelled from the party). I have heard in countless documentaries that those on the list were "perceived as politically unreliable". So I would like to know, how many of them served as officers in Tsarist times? (Which would make them former Imperials.) That should be an objective criteria investigatable. I did a brief investigation into the 3 Marshalls who were purged: Tukhachevsky, Blyukher, and Yegorov. Tukhachevsky indeed served in the Imperial Russian Army, went to two military schools, and made the rank of Second Lieutenant. I don't know if that's an officer or maybe NCO. Blyukher also served the Imperials and made it to the rank of Corporal. I'm not sure if this is considered an officer, but I would think it's at least an NCO. Yegorov was also an "army officer", according to Wikipedia, in the Imperial Russian Army until 1905. So the Marshals, which I believe were the highest ranks in the Red Army at that time, are 3 for 3. Hopefully someone knows of a study into this so some percentage can be had for the whole batch. 

After the bombing of Nagasaki, what type of A-bombs were being readied? The Little Boy types were uranium-cored with blast of about 15 kt. The Fat Man types were plutonium-cored with blast of about 21 kt. This is what wikipedia says about more A-bombs being prepared for Japan: 

A gunner ace would be someone who manned an AA gun on a ship, on the ground, or at the back of an aircraft, and got 5 or more kills (of enemy aircraft) over the course of the war. Were there any such gunner aces in WW2 (did they even record such things so we know which person got a kill from which gun)? If so, did they ever talk about how or why they were so good, like what techniques they used? (other than leading the target). Not really interested in any particular belligerent. German, Russian, Italian, British, French, Canadian, Japan, America, Dutch, many others too. 

Regarding the Battle of Britain (1940 Jly 10 - Oct 31), I've never heard anything about the AA defenses on the ground. Surely they must have had some AA flak guns? What kind, how many, and where were they focused? Wikipedia has this to say: 

Did most citizens in the USSR have bank accounts? How did they work? Plain checking accounts, or was credit allowed? Were banks open 7 days a week like non-religious government is supposed to? Was there a monthly fee for owning an account? Did they ever get around to using ATMs? 

In the United States, every citizen has a social security number for income purposes. It's a 9-digit number. This began in 1935, though I was surprised to learn from wikipedia that until 1986, most people only got their number around the age of 14. Today, everyone gets it at birth. Did the Soviets also give everyone a ID number? Was it a 9-digit number? 10-digit? A 7-character alphanumeric sequence? I searched for this on wikipedia's Passport System in the Soviet Union, because I know they used internal passports. I looked at both the English and Russian versions of the article, but could not find examples of ID numbers. I did of course also google images and found this: 

Was public transportation free in the Soviet Union? I'm interested in the metros and buses. If not, what did they cost? I'm most interested in the period around the late 1950's, early 1960's, but it would be interesting to know if the situation changed at any time during the USSR's lifespan. 

When the Seven Years War broke out, obviously they had no idea how long it would last. What did Europeans call this war at first? I know that in the North American Theater, it was called the French and Indian War. But I'm looking for the name of the war in Europe. What did Europeans call this war? Was it known by different names among the different empires? EDIT: Also, it would be good to know when it generally became known as the Seven Years War. 

The Grozny-Tuapse Pipeline appears to be the first major crude oil pipeline in the USSR, built in 1927 - 1928. (Note, the Russian version of that article has more information.) Tuapse is a port city on the Black Sea, and crude oil was exported there. I would like to know how much crude oil the USSR exported in the 1930's, and what did the Soviets receive in exchange for oil? Obviously to build such a large pipeline, they must have been exporting a lot. Note the capacity of the pipeline is stated as 1.5 Mt per year, but that does not mean it was always used at maximum capacity. 

In French, the Hudson Bay is called "La baie d'Hudson". Apparently it was originally called "mer du Nord" (North Sea) in the 1600's, the according to its french wiki page. Now obviously, Henry Hudson was an Englishmen and there was some serious competition between English and French back then. So it is not surprising that they were known by different names. What I want to know is, when did the Hudson Bay became known as La baie d'Hudson in the French Language? 

Did the USSR pledge support to Czechoslovakia before the Munich Agreement (1938 Sep 29 - 30)? If so, what kind of support did it pledge? The reason I ask is because I recently came across this article. Down a ways, there is a paragraph in which I hilighted the Soviet part: 

When Caesar crossed the Rubicon, it was illegal. Legions were supposed to disarm (edit: disband) themselves before coming back to Rome, in order to discourage any coups. But I've also read in various places that Greeks and Romans bought their own weapons. Someone of higher status could afford better equipment. So how exactly were they supposed to disarm themselves? Was there some private armory in the Alps where the weapons would be stashed? If so, how was that organized such that the possessions got back to the proper owner when he came around to collect it? And how was any of this financed? Or if just disbanding, such as crossing one-at-a-time, then I don't see why the legionaires couldn't just regather once at or near Rome. So a coup or civil war still seems easily possible. I'm most interested in the Imperial Roman Era, about 1 - 400 AD. 

From 1941 Dec 7 to 1945 May 8, what percent of the US Federal Budget was spent on the war? I would like to compare this to today's military spending, which according to this paragraph in wikipedia, is 28 - 38%. 

As I understand it, Stalin was urging the western powers to open a second front in France ever since Barbarossa begin in 1941 June. What was the official reason for waiting until 1944 June? They needed time to prepare? The U-Boat threat was too great? They felt it wiser to deal with Africa and Italy first? Edit: I read everything in the other question, but it does not answer what is the official response. I want to know what Churchill and/or Roosevelt said in response to Stalin's request.
