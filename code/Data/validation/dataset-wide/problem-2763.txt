Argument: (i) The hottest part of the solar system is the Sun. (ii) The Sun is located at the centre of the solar system. (iii) Therefore, the hottest part of the solar system is its centre. Using this reasoning, we assume it is true that: (iv) The hottest part of any physical system is its centre (v) The core is at the centre of a planet (vi) Therefore, the core is the hottest part of the planet. Similarly, (1) The hottest part of any physical system is its centre. (2) The glacier is at the centre of the lake. (3) Therefore the glacier is the hottest part of the lake (which seems implausible) The fallacy here is in the assumption that was derived from the Sun example. It is a fallacy of division, when one reasons logically that something true for the whole (the solar system) must also be true of its parts (other physical systems in the solar system). 

It has been done quite a lot of times. Complex numbers for example, as you said yourself. But also every other number set. Once, people found it weird, that they couldn't express "1/2" as one single number, so they just invented 0.5 for that. And then they had debts, so they created -10 as a possible number and so on. The only rule is, that it cannot collide with any of the accepted axioms of math, I think. I, myself not being a mathematician, cannot imagine any problems in actual math that could be solved by creating another set of numbers, but there might be some and if so, maybe someone will someday create another set, conforming to the actual math rules. 

Since I was a little kid I wondered about what people call opposites. If you ask someone "what is the opposite of white", they usually answer "black", but that's not the opposite, it is just another "color" (well, let's say black and white are colors), so they are in the same category and just not the same. It's the same with pretty much anything else people call "opposite", they don't really say something really contrary to x, but just another word that is in the same category as the word x. But then again, if I say "what is the opposite of black" and someone says pelican, it's not really true, though it is in a really other category and really "contrary" to black because it is something totally different. So, what exactly is "opposite" defined as in everyday-langauge? Is it, like I guess, "in an ordered line (e.g. for visible colors the energy of the light) of things of the same category the thing that is the farthest away from the thing that I want to name the opposite to"? And then again, what would a really contrary opposite be defined as, where it doesn't belong to the same category: Is this possible after all? 

No, you don’t need to know what truth is before you decide that something is true or not. The way we use the concept of truth is with a predicate, i.e. truth is with reference to the subject of a proposition, and all we need is the verification of our senses. For example, if you want to know that a certain cat (e.g. Schrödinger’s cat) sealed in a box is dead or alive, all you have to do is open the box. If you do open the box and find that the cat is dead, then your earlier statement (if you made one), p = The cat is dead, is true, else, according to Quantum Physics, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time (in Nagarjuna’s tetralemma: p AND ~p is the case just before you open the box, which does away with Aristotle’s principle of non-contradiction (law of the excluded middle, i.e. either a proposition is true or its negation is true.) In Mathematics we have no need for the verification of our sense, but we must follow a series of steps (rules, laws, procedures) determined by logic and, sometimes, by intuition. Platonists on the other hand believe that there is such a thing as Truth, an Ideal Form, which has little to do with the truths revealed by our senses but is like the truth revealed by mathematics. The same applies also to other concepts, e.g. Justice, Freedom, Good, Evil, etc. But this idea has no practical value in a mundane world. Nietzsche said that all such terms (those above) are governed by conventions and we must not forget that they are metaphors, metonymies, etc.: “What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short, a sum of human relations which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.” (Nietzsche: On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense). For Nietzsche, and for a lot of other people, “Truth … the ‘thing in itself’ (for that is what pure truth, without consequences, would be) is quite incomprehensible to the creators of language and not at all worth aiming for.” (Nietzsche: On Truth and ...etc.) 

Deontology focuses on the rules, or the universal norms. A person is said to be morally right if he conforms to these rules. For example, given a choice, a person is morally right if he abstains from killing a person, even if killing that person could bring about greater benefits. The fundamental difference is that for virtue ethics, you can say someone is morally right only if his actions express a certain virtue. For example, a man who helps an old lady cross the road has the virtue of kindness. In contrast, lying and cowardice are blameworthy since they depart from virtues like honesty and courage. There are no absolute rights and wrongs in philosophy. However, here you may want to argue about which is the best way to go about consigning blame or blamelessness to actions/agents in different situations. Virtue ethics can perhaps provide a set of guidelines as to what to do and what not to do. For example, if by not lying you show that you are trustworthy, by virtue you are seen as morally right and thus praiseworthy. Similarly a deontologist would say that you did the right thing since you obeyed moral norms. However, a scenario could discern between a deontologist and virtue ethicist: a child falls into deep sea- person A jumps in to save her, disregarding the danger of the high waves. Person B decides not to make the jump, given that he might risk dying. Both the deontologist and virtue ethicist would praise person A for doing the right thing morally, furthermore he is also seen as courageous. However, person B was wrong since he just stood by and weakened his claim to virtue by displaying cowardice. In a similar scenario, what if there was a reward of a million dollars? We can predict that person B will likely jump in to save the child, since the reward far outweighs the cost. In the deontologist books, he does the right thing by this action alone. On the contrary, a virtue ethicist would say that one action is not enough to determine that he is a virtuous person. In essence, he is still a coward inside. 

To know that something is true means to know that something is the case. For example if one makes the statement p, ‘The sun rises in the east’, and you want to find out if p is true, you need to go out there and observe the rising or not rising of the sun in the east. If the sun rises in the east, as has been the case for us humans for thousands of years, then we say that p is true. This is called inductive reasoning, which has served us very well and allowed us to make magnificent technological progress. You don’t need to know what ‘truth’ is. Truth is just another way of saying that something is the case for a particular object or event in a specific time and place. In other words, Truth is not a Platonic idea to which all things partake in order to obtain the property of trueness. This means that truth is not absolute but relative to the perspective we take. Outside our specific perspective the notion of truth does not make any sense. For example, if you live on a space station and make the statement p, ‘The sun rises in the east”, then p is meaningless. In space there are no cardinal points, or up, down, left, right. All these orientations make sense and can have a true/false value only if we decide to adopt a point of reference, to which these orientations will be relative. In addition, we assume that the laws of nature are true everywhere in the universe. We make assumptions in order to work on our theories to build models that would explain the world. And know very well that progress is made only when our models are falsified. In which case we are forced to change our assumptions (what we held as true) about the world and proceed to build new models on the basis of the newly acquired knowledge. To know that p means that we take p to be true, until evidence proves otherwise. This is how knowledge progresses, by revising our beliefs or what we hold as true for a particular object or event. 

Imagine there is an allmighty god. Inspired by the question of "what would make you as a rational person believe, that book X was written by God Y", I thought of this: That book must present to me pi, as a fraction of 2 integers (in the decimal-system), which is, as far as I know, impossible. I certainly know that different persons will have different opinions on this, depending on what they define as "God", but the question is, as I think, quite interesting. 

E.g. the borders of countries: They are formed by arbitrary "rules": Sometimes rivers and coasts, but mostly due wars and other weird, historical stuff that doesn't really exist in a reality outside of the ideological concept of our imagined self-importance (at least they seem so to me: Nothing in reality ever stops at a border from one country to another, let it be disease or just animals walking around or mountains going through or...). They do not have any basis in reality (contrair to concepts like "humid" and "arid"), they do not give any more value than a more-or-less-random guess, and still, people, all around the world, persist on using these "systems" to "measure" things (e.g. racism, xenophobia, but also "the [xyz-land] culture"). Why is that so? Why do humans create arbitrary systems with no basis in reality just to use these systems do to things with it that again have no better chance in succeeding than random chance (as you might have witnessed yourself if anyone talks about foreigners being stupid, lazy and so on or people belonging to the "race" x being ... and people belonging to the "race" y being totally different). I really don't quite get that.
