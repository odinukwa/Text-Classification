As always, we should take care not to over-generalize. The Pilgrim Fathers who settled Plymouth numbered barely 100, yet even they represented a cross-section of English commoners. Some would have held comfortable places in English society were it not for their congregationalist religious beliefs. The first governor, John Carver, was a wealthy merchant. William Brewster, the religious elder, was a Cambridge-educated diplomat. Most of the other passengers were farmers or tradesmen, or of unknown occupation. Not all who traveled on the Mayflower were religiously motivated, however. John Alden, by legend the first to step foot on Plymouth Rock, was a sailor in the employ of the Mayflower's owners. Myles Standish, while religiously sympathetic, was originally a hired gun for military and security affairs. Others were laborers recruited to work in the colony, or servants of the other settlers, and there were four children sent as indentured servants having been disowned as illegitimate. 

Panama became independent of Colombia in 1903. Other regions of unitary states have declared independence but not achieved universal international diplomatic recognition, e.g. 

Many 17th century settlers in what is now the United States were indeed indigent or criminals, but not all, and we should understand the "criminality" in question. Many English farmers lost their livelihood due to enclosure, which had reached new heights during the Tudor years. Some ran themselves into debt and faced debtors' prison (indeed, Georgia Colony was originally intended to be a haven where debtors could work off their debts instead of wasting away in jail). At the same time, as the early colonies grew and prospered, they faced labor shortages. It is not surprising then that many companies were formed to ship surplus labor from the British Isles to North America, recouping the expense of transport by collecting the passenger's wages over seven years of indentured servitude. Besides indebtedness, worshipping outside the current fashion of the Church of England could also land you in legal trouble. "Puritans" (encompassing a variety of Reformed theology groups), Baptists, Quakers, and Anabaptists were out of favor, not to mention Catholics, Lutherans, or Unitarians. Adherents of any minority religion would have seen a strong incentive to emigrate, and officials would have had an incentive to see them leave the country. As for common criminals, to be sure, there would have been some. Certainly, people with such histories or inclinations would have seen an additional incentive to pursue a new life on another continent. On the other hand, the companies investing in colonies would have had little incentive to transport large numbers of unreliable petty thugs and thieves, the better to lose their investment. Neither were there large-scale deportations of criminals from England to the Americas: Pennsylvania was not Van Diemen's Land. 

One must consider both the strength of Goguryeo and the weakness of its surrounding states. Strength of Goguryeo Goguryeo had seen severe military setbacks during the reign of Gogugwon at the hands of the Earlier Yan polity and Baekje— Gogugwon was killed in battle by Geungusu, crown prince of the latter. Geungusu failed to follow up on the victory and proceed with the conquest of Goguryeo, allowing the latter to regain its strength. King Sosurim of Goguryeo enacted a number of reforms to strengthen royal authority and unify the state. Buddhism was encouraged to solidify national spirituality, and Confucian academies trained bureaucrats to serve the royal administration. He also promulgated a code of laws. Weakness of Goguryeo's neighbors On Goguryeo's northern borders, there was turmoil as the Earlier Yan kingdom collapsed and gave way to the Later Yan. After the reign of Murong Chui, the Later Yan was distracted by a succession of palace intrigues and territorial pressures from the Northern Wei dynasty and the Jin dynasty. To the south, the third of Korea's "Three Kingdoms," Silla, was becoming organized a centralized kingdom. They established relations with Goguryeo for defense against Baekje, which had allied with Wa (Yamato Japan) and invaded in 399. The King of Silla offered himself as a vassal in exchange for support, which came the following year. Success in battle Thus, the stage was set for an ambitious king like Gwanggaeto to expand territory greatly. Jinsa and Asin of Baekje were weak warriors, and their mass conscriptions alienated their subjects and caused some to flee to Silla. After steadily losing territory, Asin prepared his capital at Wiryeseong against a land invasion in 396. Gwanggaeto attacked from the river instead, catching them unprepared, and subjugated Baekje. In 399 as noted above they rebelled with the assistance of Wa, but were defeated. With Baekje and Silla neutralized in the south, Gwanggaeto could turn his attention to the north. The Later Yan, weakened by misrule and warfare with the Northern Wei, were expelled from the Liaodong Peninsula, and their successor, the Northern Yan, made peace in 408 and survived as a vassal. That in turn freed Gwanggaeto to annex the remnant Buyeo in 410. 

First, I don't believe the text of Kennedy's original letter has ever been released. The original news story by Tim Sebastian (former Moscow correspondent for the BBC), published in The Sunday Times on 2 February 1992, covers a memo written in 1983 by Victor Chebrikov, the text of which is nowadays freely circulated, and available among other places in the appendix of the 2007 book The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism by Paul Kengor (a complimentary history of Reagan's policies in Europe). Second, the column you cite is an opinion piece from a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, a right-wing think tank with little love for Kennedy's approach to communism. In other words, we are three degrees removed. There was the original letter then an interpretation of the letter offered by a bemused KGB officer— which would not be evidence of treason. And then we form another interpretation based on that memo. The article you read is one opinion writer's judgment of Kennedy based on his interpretation, which is adequate for politics but not history. Did Kennedy sincerely believe that Yuri Andropov, ambassador to Hungary during the brutal suppression of the 1956 rebellion and architect of the suppression of the Prague Spring, cared more about world peace than his own president, who unlike his three predecessors sought to challenge that regime rather than learn to live with it? That would be truly dumbfounding. 

The question moves from two observations— that among industrialized nations, the United States spending on philanthropy is the highest (1.67%) and that its taxes on high-income individuals are among the lowest— to a speculation about the thought process of donors. Hmm, well. There have been a number of studies on the effects of income tax rate changes on charitable giving. According to a 2008 paper by National Bureau of Economic Research researchers entitled How Does Charitable Giving Respond to Incentives and Income? Dynamic Panel Estimates Accounting for Predictable Changes in Taxation, charitable donations among the wealthy are relatively inelastic. Tax rate changes are seen as short-term fluctuations, whereas the level of philanthropic giving is governed by long-term considerations, and so the result is in line with Milton Friedman's Permanent Income Hypothesis. For very wealthy individuals, tax benefits are not in and of themselves a reason to start or to increase giving. Even though the U.S. has strong tax incentives for charitable contributions, federal income taxes started falling 1981 and are now among the lowest in the industrialized world. Donations have thus become more "expensive," yet against predictions, giving has actually increased. As The Economist notes, "Surveys suggest that tax rules affect the size and timing of gifts, but not the initial decision to give." I must include some comments on some other possible misapprehensions. First, a feature of American philanthropy is that it is considered a civic duty of all classes, not just the wealthy, as attested to by de Tocqueville (and by universities' aggressive solicitation of donations from their deeply indebted recent graduates). Second, it is arguable that philanthropy affects the tax code as much as the tax code affects philanthropy. There is broad popular support for the role of non-profit organizations in American society and genuine concern when their funding is imperiled. Indeed, the tax deduction for charitable donations was actually introduced during World War I out of concern that high taxes would make Americans less generous to their churches and hospitals. Third, philanthropy is tied up with social and religious sentiments which can trump purely economic considerations. The Economist article linked earlier notes that France has much stronger incentives for giving than Germany, yet Germans give substantially more as a percentage of GDP than the French. There are whole think tanks that study the role of philanthropy in American society who can probably provide a more authoritative answer. Some recent histories on this topic include Charity, Philanthropy, and Civility in American History by Lawrence J. Friedman and Mark D. McGarvie (2002, University of Cambridge) and Philanthropy in America: A History by Olivier Zunz (2011, Princeton University). The seminal work was American Philanthropy by Robert H. Bremner (1960, rev. 1988, University of Chicago). 

First, economically successful migrant minorities are often resented by the local indigenous majority: the experience of the Chinese in southeast Asia has been compared to that of Jews in Europe, South Asians in East Africa, and even Koreans in American inner cities. Family-based investment networks, business savvy, and overseas connections— and laws against land ownership and participation in certain industries— led ethnic Chinese to dominate a few industries and to control a disproportionate amount of the economy; a 1995 survey found that despite being only 3% of Indonesia's population, they controlled 73% of its publicly listed companies (though not 80% of its economy as was sometimes reported). Second, as many as a third of ethnic Chinese are Christian and many others are Buddhist or Confucian, while the remainder of the country is overwhelmingly Muslim. So even though they have lived in Indonesia for hundreds of years, many in the majority view them as outsiders and with suspicion. Third, hatred against the Chinese was long cultivated. The VOC had actively recruited Chinese middlemen during the sugar boom of the early 18th century; after Chinese mill workers rioted over wages in 1740, however, they were massacred and subjected to discriminatory laws for the remainder of the colonial period. Like any successful minority, they are a convenient scapegoat and distraction for governments. As the Suharto regime was consolidating its power in the 1960s, many generals and officials enacted discriminatory measures against the Chinese such as forcing them to register for deportation and banning the Chinese language and encouraging ethnic Chinese to take Indonesian names. Ironically, fear of communist China spurred mistrust of the successfully capitalist Chinese-Indonesians as well. At the same time, while most Chinese-Indonesians were small business owners such as shopkeepers, a few politically connected figures had a high profile (the cukong system). Resentment againts the nepotism and corruption of the Suharto years thus merged with resentment against Chinese economic success. So, in the population at large there was a great deal of ignorance/fear about and resentment of the peranakan Chinese, and there are frequent incidents of anti-Chinese violence into the 1990s. When the 1997 Asian financial crisis hit, the Indonesian economy went into a tailspin as the rupiah collapsed and austerity measures imposed by the IMF sent commodity prices, including food, soaring, spurring more hatred of traders and financiers among whom the Chinese were disproportionately represented. But Purdey argues further that the 1998 Jakarta riots were systematic, not spontaneous. For example, rape gangs were clearly seeking out Chinese women, but rape had not been a feature of earlier violence; rather, it implicated the military, whose repressions in Aceh and East Timor had also been marked with rape, a link later confirmed Another study found that violence began simultaneously in different parts of Jakarta (and against Buddhist populations), unlike most riots which ripple out from a single point, suggesting they were at least partially orchestrated. 

Christmas has many fathers, as traditions like gift-giving and feasting have periodically risen and then been suppressed over the centuries, and then revived with newly Christian significance retroactively applied to what might have originated in a secular or pagan custom. The most recent father of our modern idea of the Christmas season in the "Anglo-Saxon" world, is the Victorian era, with certain customs developing independently in England and in the United States. Christmas trees, Christmas cards, turkey dinners, and caroling were all popularized in the mid-19th century. This is thoroughly covered in J.A.R. Pimlott's The Englishman's Christmas: a social history (harvester, 1978). Gift-giving was, as in many cultures, originally a New Year's Day custom; the Scots have Handsel Monday and the French the étrenne. The latter term derives from the Latin strena, a term for both the gift and the gift-giving of the Roman festival of Saturnalia, and attests to its ancient origins. In addition to gifts to each other, medieval Europeans were to offer gifts to the sovereign; the 13th century chronicler Matthew Paris writes of Henry III extorting gifts from his court. The heathen custom was rationalized into Christianity by associating it with the gifts of the Magi described in Matthew 2 (observed on Epiphany, January 6 in the Western Chruch) and with the story of Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, who was said to have given away his entire inheritance to the needy (observed on December 6). Saint Nicholas, of course, is the origin of the name "Santa Claus," and some of the associations of Santa Claus. Still, it was frequently suppressed, notably by the Puritans, and Christmas was not a particularly special holiday for centuries. The gift-giving custom was revived in the Victorian age. It was an era where there was strong interest in reviving old customs (real and imagined), but as the popularity of Christmas grew, it displaced New Year's; Prince Albert called Christmas "a day for the exchange of presents, as marks of mutual affection and good-will." This image of Christmas was popularized by Charles Dickens in a series of Christmas season stories published from 1843 to 1848, the most famous of course being A Christmas Carol. 

There are no surviving works by Nymphodorus Syracusanus. Some fragments were included in C. Müller's Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum, vol. ii (page 375 and onward). We know of him and of his writing about Drimakos' slave revolt on Chios through an extended quote in Athenaeus; his name is also mentioned by Vitruvius. Müller argues that he may the same person as Nymphodorus of Amphipolis. 

Las Vegas was not founded in a particularly random desert. It was founded on a meadow (las vegas is Spanish for "the meadows") watered by the nearby Big Springs, or Las Vegas Springs. As such it was a watering spot on the Old Spanish Trail. After the Civil War, O.D. Gass set up the first permanent white settlement there. Other settlers followed, and it was an important enough agricultural center to attract a stop on the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad. This put them within a day's reach of Los Angeles and the sea, contributing to substantial growth. As the nearest major settlement to the Hoover Dam, Las Vegas also enjoyed an influx of population and money during its construction, and cheap electricity and tourists headed for Lake Mead after its completion. They were boosted again with the construction of nearby Nellis Air Force Base. The aquifer feeding the springs that had first attracted settlers to the area were sucked dry by the 1950s, but by then the city was already by far the largest population center in southern Nevada, and tourism and the military had long since displaced agriculture in the local economy.
