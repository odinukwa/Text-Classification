A. J. Ayer, a very famous twentieth century analytic philosopher, with the help of Jane O'Grady published a book entitled A Dictionary Of Philosophical Quotations which should provide you with exactly what you are looking for. In addition, John Bartlett's book Bartlett's Familiar Quotations is one of the most famous collection of quotations in existence. Per its wikipedia entry: 

The hyphen does indeed mean negation (for this answer I'll use ~). The ending of the paragraph that you've quoted gives the precise meanings of the symbols you are asking about. Granted, I do not understand why Aune didn't introduce the symbols first (they are not found in Taylor's paper, but maybe they were common in literature at that time). The ram's head implication, ≺, stands for logical implication. The superset implication, ⊃, stands for the regular truth functional material implication. The arrow implication, →, as is stated, represents physical implication. Here are the relevant parts of the paragraph that explain this: 

Physicalism says that only physical things exist and our best scientific theories are what should provide the model for that ontology. Neuroscience is our best physical theory about the brain, which is where most of our understanding of human life and death comes from, so if we believe in physicalism we should believe in what neuroscience has to tell us. You alluded to a vegetative state in your question and it should be noted that vegetation is not the same thing as brain death. I believe that the answer to this question will need some clarifications, especially about consciousness. That being said, I believe that after these clarifications it is very clear that physicalism provides a great understanding of what the line between life and death is. Now, on to consciousness. Physicalism says that a person's mind is synonymous with their brain and that consciousness is just a collection of brain states. It's very true that we do not have an exact understanding of what consciousness is, but we do know that it is located in certain parts of the brain (the thalamus plays a central role). However, even without having the exact details down we still know (mostly) what things are involved in consciousness and (mostly) what things aren't. Organisms do not need to have a brain, or even consciousness, to be alive, though. The vast majority of life on Earth (plants, fungi, bacteria, etc.) does not have a brain. Death of an organism is the condition wherein all biological processes that are required to sustain its life irreversibly cease to happen. Human death is defined as the complete death of all areas of the brain. This is different from any cultural idea of death as "the inability of a person to walk around, have consciousness, etc." As long as the biological processes that allow life to sustain itself are still happening, the organism is still alive. Although some people might refer to someone who is in a comatose state and does not have consciousness as being dead, our current medical understanding is that as long as they can still maintain metabolic processes unassisted they are alive. This is because, although some areas of their brain may have died, the areas that maintain the metabolic processes required to live unassisted are still functioning. Death is when all functions of the brain have irreversibly ceased. So, imagine you have severe trauma to the brain stem, the part of the brain that controls your breathing and blood pressure (as well as some other important functions for sustaining life). Other parts of the brain, for example the frontal cortex, might not have sustained any damage from that trauma, so they might be functioning perfectly well. However, after a short amount of time, if the trauma to the brain stem was so damaging as to disallow it from functioning, then the rest of the brain will also die. If blood is not able to flow to the rest of the brain the metabolic processes of those parts will cease to happen and they will die. Cells, especially neurons, are incredibly delicate structures and if they sustain enough damage they will never be able to function again. If enough of these cells are damaged then the brain will never be able to function again. This is why death is irreversible. In this case of the death of the brain stem, the person may still be conscious for a few moments afterwards. The parts of the brain that control consciousness have not yet suffered cell death and are continuing to function. However, once the lack of blood causes those cells to die as well all areas of the brain will have ceased to function and the person will be dead. The exact point of death is best understood as the point where cell death has become so great that any sort of ability to reverse the processes is gone. Now, it’s true that we put a lot focus on the brain because the brain is what normally regulates our entire body. The brain is what controls our respiratory and circulatory systems and without the brain those systems will fail. For humans being in a state where those systems fail and damage is caused that will reversibly forbid them to ever function on their own again is synonymous with dying. The person could have been without consciousness due to other trauma to the brain for months before that moment. In that situation, as long as their brain stem still functioned and they were able to live unassisted they would still be alive. However, the moment that the rest of the brain loses its ability to function, the person will die. 

Where the first two things are premises and the last is a conclusion. We used a specific syllogism as our rule of inference before, but there are many other modern rules of inference that are not syllogisms. Categorical propositions are similar to quantifiers, but remember that this is old and not modern logic. Categorical propositions are propositions that say one of these four things: 

The fallacy has to do with the idea of appealing to an authority being applied to deductive reasoning. A deductive argument, or a valid logical argument, is one where if all of the premises are true, then the conclusion has to be true. In a literal way, it is assured to be true as well. This property is sometimes called the preservation of truth. Arguments that have this property are valid arguments, fallacies do not have this property, and the appeal to authority is an example of a fallacy because of this. So how this applies to the fallacy of appeal to authority is that it is not the case that an authority will always be correct about a subject. The argument looks like this: Premise: Jane Smith is an authority on Psychology. Premise: Jane Smith says that the human mind is not complex. Conclusion: Therefore, the human mind is not complex. We can see that this argument does not work. First, there is a hidden assumption, along the lines of “whatever an authority says about a subject is true” but this is obviously false, there are many examples of authorizes being wrong. Without that hidden assumption, it is possible for the two premises to be true but the conclusion to be false. The human mind is complex, we know that much about neuroscience and psychology. Jane could conceivably be an expert and hold an incorrect view about the subject, so the argument is not valid. Notice that in this example, I chose a pretty extreme case (it’s unlikely that an expert is psychology would believe that the human mind is not complex), but there are many examples from, say, mathematics where an authority believed they proved something that they actually didn’t, so they held a similar false belief about their field even though they’re an authority on it. Additionally there is a stronger, a little more informal, justification for why the argument is a fallacy: the fallacy asserts that because someone is an authority, the statement is true. As in, what makes the statement “human minds are not complex” true? The fact that an authority, Jane, said it. If that statement were true, it would be because of facts about the human brain, not just the fact that some person said it was so. The appeal to authority fallacy doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t trust authorities, it means that the fact that an authority says something is not the reason that statement is true, nor does it mean that statement is true. Premise: Frege is an expert in logic Premise: Frege believes Basic Law V is consistent Conclusion: Therefore Basic Law V is consistent It is a fallacy to say that because Frege is an expert and believes Basic Law V is true, then it is true. What Frege believes is not what gives the truth value to the statement, and it is of course possible for experts to be wrong. 

Philpapers is a collection of papers having to do with philosophy, although you are very likely to run into pay walls most of the time, as is common with most academic paper repositories. Searching for your topic returns these results. There is the American Journal of Psychoanalysis but again you will end up running into pay walls trying to access specific articles. I would suggest you talk to your university and see if you can get access through them. Additionally, there are many websites devoted to the study of Lacan's psychoanalysis that may contain useful information for you. See: 

When he says "There would be no contradiction, of course, in an announcement that (I hope the ages do not make this impossible), fantastic as it may sound, she was indeed the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Truman." what he means is that there would be no logical contradiction if we find out that it is in fact true that the Queen of England was born to different parents than the people we think she was born to now; it is a possible proposition. What he is saying is that "Elizabeth, Queen of England" in our natural language refers to that woman there, sitting on the throne. If it were the case that we lived in another possible world and there was some other woman who was born to different parents whom also became the Queen of England, even if she had the same name, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, we would be referring to a completely different person when we referred to her. 

The epistemological argument is centered around the idea that human beings cannot have any sort of knowledge of abstract objects that exist outside of our spacetime. This is similar to (if not outright the same as) the argument against mind-body dualism referred to as the the problem of interaction. The problem of interaction is exactly what is going on with our premise (3), how can something abstract and unphysical interact with something physical? How can the platonic forms have a causal impact on human knowledge if they have no way to interact with us? In the Phaedo, Plato gives his original argument for his forms by stating that the soul is immortal and also an immaterial object that exists in the Realm of Forms when it is not inside of a living body. He also makes the argument that learning, gaining knowledge, is actually remembrance; he argues that the soul has eternal knowledge of all forms but suffers from amnesia. So, if the soul already has knowledge of forms there is no need to be worried about whether or not it can gain knowledge from an abstract realm that humans cannot access. This argument might seem to skip the epistemological argument, but unfortunately it goes directly back into the mind-body problem. If the soul is immaterial and is what possesses knowledge, how does it causally communicate that knowledge to the brain? This is another example of how the problem of interaction and the epistemological argument are related in this context. Counter arguments against the epistemological argument have been recently given by John Burgess and Gideon Rosen in two essays: "Nominalism Reconsidered, part of The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic, and A Subject with No Object: Strategies for Nominalistic Interpretation of Mathematics. Their arguments center mainly on the idea that "nominalist epistemological premises typically turn out to be either too weak or too strong." They go on the say that even if a nominalist were to find a "just right" formulation of the argument, they would still fall into a trap. From "Nominalism Reconsidered": 

It depends on what exactly you want to get out of your reading. Due to the formatting of this question being pretty subjective, I'll offer an overview of what the different books cover and what you will gain from reading them and you can make the choice of which one to read yourself. The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the Greater Philosophers by Will Durant is a book that explores many of the major Western philosophers, putting their work into historical context and then elaborating on their main ideas. Russell's A History of Western Philosophy does much the same thing. However, one of the major differences between the two is their scope. Russell covers much more of the history of philosophy in his book, having sections that are completely omitted from Durant's work. These include a section on the Pre-Socratic philosophers as well as Greek philosophers that came after Aristotle. Durant only covers Plato and Aristotle's work. Durant also skips the Catholic Medieval philosophers and goes directly from Aristotle to Francis Bacon. It would be remiss to say that the scholastics had no influence on Western philosophy. What Durant trades for in scope he makes up for in detail; while he does not cover as many philosophers as Russell does, Durant goes into much greater detail for most of the philosophers that he does cover. For example, Russell's section on Schopenhauer is around seven or eight pages while Durant's is around forty; Russell's section on Spinoza is around twelve pages while Durant's is around forty; etc. At their core, Russell's book is about the sequence of ideas and thinkers that ran throughout history leading to where we are now (well, to where we were a hundred years ago when he wrote the book) and Durant's work is about a few of the more major philosophers that participated in that process up until now (or, again, when the book was written). The titles of the books really do reveal what content is inside. The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the Greater Philosophers is about the lives and the opinions of some of the more important philosophers in Western philosophy while A History of Western Philosophy is a trace of its history. The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas That Have Shaped Our World View was saved for last because it is much unlike the other two books. The first two books are reviews or histories of the subject, while Tarnas' work is more like an actual piece of philosophy. He is not only trying to explain the sequence of ideas that lead to modernity and post modernity in Western culture, he is also trying to make arguments about this history of events and how they impacted the world we live in now. Tarnas is a psychologist/cultural historian and he makes his own arguments in his book. This is very different from Durant and Russell's books which for the most part detail and explain the ideas of other philosophers (although there is a small section at the end of A History of Western Philosophy that explains Russell's personal philosophy). Tarnas' book is a history of Western philosophy, but it is more so his argument for how that history is shaping the world today and how people should live accordingly. If you want to read about the entire history of Western philosophy up to the 1920's you should read Russell. If you want to read a work that focuses more on specific, major philosophers and gives their arguments more detail then you should read Durant. If you want to read Tarnas' views about how the modern world is shaped by the history of philosophy and how our psyche should perceive the cosmos around us then you should read Tarnas.
