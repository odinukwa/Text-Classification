It sounds like you have a percolation problem. In percolation theory one has a lattice, typically in the plane or in 3-space, and each vertex is "porous" independently with probability $p$. The question is to describe the connected components of the set of porous vertices. It is common to restrict to a finite box, as in your example. One expects a similar behaviour to the Erdős–Rényi graph model, and there are many cases in which it is proved (although there may be less emphasis on the size of the small components). Edit: As Ben Barber points out in his answer, the techniques used are quite different to the Erdős–Rényi case, and one needs a much larger value of $p$ in order to expect a giant component. For some impressive-sounding real-world motivation one might imagine oil percolating through rock; it can only pass through porous areas, and the question is whether it eventually occupies a positive proportion of the rock (in which case one can drill into it and make some money). For many researchers the actual motivation is probably more to do with theoretical understanding of phase transitions. These problems are well studied, for example there are some introductory lecture notes here. On a casual inspection I cannot actually find an example where diagonal connections (cells connected only at their corners) are permitted, as in your question. Frustratingly I actually remember playing with a simulation of exactly your example in a physics lesson back in my schooldays. Maybe I can track it down. 

Here "nice" means that there is an explicit description of the action of the standard generators of $\mathfrak{g}$, so one could actually write (infinite) matrices for the Lie algebra elements. I have checked some sources including Lie Algebras of Finite and Affine Type by R. Carter and Affine Lie Algebras, Weight Multiplicities and Branching Rules by Kass, Moody, Patera and Slansky, but none contains such details even for the smallest cases like $\tilde{A}_1$. Here is a picture from the second: 

Your question is essentially about surjective stability for relative symplectic $K_1$. The latter follows from the usual (absolute) surjective stability for $K_1$, which in symplectic case starts at $2n\geq \mathop{\mathrm{sr}}(R)$. To prove this, one can use so-called "Stein relativization", as described in M. Stein, "Relativizing Functors on Rings and Algebraic K-Theory", J.Algebra, 1971. See Corollary 1.7 therein or the remark after Theorem 4.2 in Stein's other paper, "Stability theorems for $K_1$, $K_2$ and related functors modelled on Chevalley groups", Japan J. Math, 1978. It is also possible to prove it directly under somewhat weaker assumprion on a ring by explicit calculations with generators, but since you are interested in Dedekind domains, the usual stable rank condition should suffice. 

Corollary 7.10 extends this result to rings of the form $A[x_1^\pm,\ldots,x_k^\pm,x_{k+1},\ldots,x_n]$ for $A$ regular. For other Chevalley groups the situation is complicated. One has the stability theorems for $K_1(\Phi)$ in terms of stable rank (or its ramifications such as absolute stable rank or $\Lambda$-stable rank), but they give pretty bad bounds for polynomial rings. There is, however, the following version of Suslin's theorem for symplectic group in a paper "On symplectic groups over polynomial rings" by F. Grunewald, J. Mennicke and L. Vaserstein: 

L. Vaserstein obtain a generation result in a very large generality, which encompasses all finitely generated commutative algebras over fields or PIDs: 

As I said in a comment, the answer to 1 is trivially no. The answer to 2 (as edited) is also no. Platonov and Tavgen produced a finitely generated, infinitely presented subgroup $H$ in the square $F\times F$ of a free groups such that the inclusion induces an isomorphism of profinite completions (and hence of pro-$p$-completions for all $p$). Here, $F$ can be constructed as follows. Consider any epimorphism $p:F\to P$ from $F$ to an infinite finitely presented group $P$ with no nontrivial finite quotient; then $H$ is defined as the fibre product $\{(g,h)\in F\times F:p(g)=p(h)\}$. That $P$ is finitely presented is used to ensure that $H$ is finitely generated. That $P$ has no nontrivial proper quotient is used by Platonov and Tavgen to prove that the inclusion induces an isomorphism of profinite completions. That the fibre product $H$ is infinitely presented is a classical fact on fiber products. Reference: V. Platonov O.Tavgen. On the Grothendieck problem of profinite completions of groups.

Morally, any first attack on Waring's problem (e.g. Chapter 2 of Vaughan) works here, but to be rigorous one might modify the argument on the major arcs. If you want to quote an explicit result I suggest Birch; Theorem 1 in Section 7 needs only cosmetic changes to yield the following result: Theorem (Birch) Let $f(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dotsc,x_k]$ have degree $d$, let $g(x)$ be the leading part. Suppose the singular locus of $g$ has codimension $>(d-1)2^d$ in $\mathbb{C}^k$. Let $\nu\in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathscr{B}\subset [-1,1]^k$ be a box of side at most $1$. For some $\delta>0$, the number of integer points $x\in P\mathscr{B}$ with $f(x)=\nu$ is $$ C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}P^{k-d}+O_{f}(P^{k-d-\delta}) $$ If for each prime $p$ there is $x$ with $f({x})\equiv\nu$ and $\nabla f(x)\not\equiv 0$ mod $p$, and there is a solution $\bar{x}\in \mathscr{B}$ to $g(\bar{x})=1$ with distance $\geq r$ from the real singular locus of $g(\bar{x})=1$, then $C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}\gg_{f,r} 1$. Take $\mathscr{B}=\frac{1}{2}\big[(\frac{1}{2s})^{1/d},(\frac{2}{s})^{1/d}\big]^k$ and $P= 2\nu^{1/d}$. If $\nu\gg_f 1$, $k>(d-1)2^d$ and $\sum P_i(x_i)\equiv\nu$ has nonsingular solutions mod $p$ then we deduce that $\sum P_i(x_i)=\nu$ has many solutions in your range. Why does this follow from Birch's work? That paper is about some degree $d$ forms $f_1,\dotsc,f_R$. But actually, after the introduction, we can take the $f_i$ to be general degree $d$ polynomials if we replace $f_i$ by its leading part in the following places: the definition of $f^{(i)}_{j_0,\dotsc,j_{d-1}}$ at the start of Section 2; the definition $V(\mu)$ and $V^*$ in formulae (2) and (3) of Section 3; the definition of $I(\mathscr{C};\gamma)$ in formula (9) of Section 5; and throughout Section 6. In Section 7, Theorem 1 we need to replace $f_i$ by its leading part in the definition of $V^*$ and in the expression $\Phi[f(\bar{x})]$. The theorem above is exactly this in the case $R=1$ of a single polynomial. The argument really does not change. A little thought to see that Lemma 5.1 is still true, that's it. 

Consider the root system $\mathsf{B}_n$ with the standard numbering of the fundamental roots (that is, $\alpha_n$ is short). Take $\alpha_{n-2}$ and $\alpha_n$ as a pair of orthogonal roots (indeed, $\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_n$ is not a root), and take $\gamma=\alpha_{n-1}+\alpha_n$. Then $\beta_1=\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_{n-1}+\alpha_n$, $\beta_2=\alpha_{n-1}+2\alpha_n$ and $\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_{n-1}+2\alpha_n$ are all roots. But among the differences of the form $\beta_i-\alpha_j$ the only roots are $\beta_1-\alpha_{n-2}$, $\beta_1-\alpha_n$ and $\beta_2-\alpha_n$, so this gives a counter-example. The beautiful pictures of Hasse diagrams you refer to provide a good way to spot such examples, but for this one should draw them in a different way, which is easier to read. The keyword here is a weight diagram. For examples, see this collection of the diagrams along with a description of their various usages. Namely, Figure 14 on page 35 is the weight diagram of the adjoint representation of a group (or of a Lie algebra) of type $\mathsf{B}_n$, which also describes the structure of the root system (its vertices are the roots, plus the "zero weights" corresponding to the fundamental roots). One looks for a square which has non-consecutive label on its sides (say $i$ and $j$), such that the bonds joining its top or bottom vertex to something on the right are also labeled by either $i$ or $j$. Such a square is immediately found on the very bottom of the picture slightly to the left from the middle. By the way, the quick inspection of the weight diagrams shows that there is no counter-examples besides the one above (I'm not sure, but I haven't spotted any). 

Here is a better answer than the other answer I gave, which is currently accepted. It also answers some of your questions in the comments on that answer. Pick a branch of log, then $B$ and $ (zw)^{1/2}$ are holomorphic and their arguments differ by a multiple of $\pi$ wherever they are both defined. So their quotient is a real holomorphic function and hence a real constant wherever it is defined. So locally, $B$ has to be a real multiple of some branch of $ (zw)^{1/2}$. 

Work in cylindrical co-ordinates $(r,\theta,z)$. Let the big strip of flat surface be given by $r=R$, $0\leq \theta\leq 1$ and $-R\leq z \leq R$. This has length $R$ in the "curved" direction (going around the cylinder) and width 2R in the "straight" direction (parallel to the axis of the cylinder). As I understand your question, you have two line segments and you want a simple-looking smooth surface which connects them. One line segment is $r=R$, $\theta=0$, $-R\leq z\leq 0$. The second line segment is $r=R$, $\theta = 1$, $0\leq z \leq R$. An example of such a surface is given in parametric form by $$(r,\theta,z)=(R+t\sin(\pi\theta),\theta,R+t\cos(\pi\theta))$$ where $0\leq \theta\leq 1$ and $0\leq t\leq 1$. 

No. Let $w=1$ for simplicity. If the imaginary part $\Im z> 0$ then $\Im B(z,1)>0$ and if $\Im z< 0$ then $\Im B(z,1)<0$, so $B(z,1)$ vanishes on the line $\Im z=0$ so it is uniformly 0. The same thing happens for any $w$, just replace $\Im z$ by $\Im (z/w)$. 

It's not true. Here's an easy way to get $[0,1]$ as a limit. Consider $C_0$ as the set of all sequences of $0,1$: each such sequence defines a binary expansion of some element in $[0,1]$. Let $C_n$ be obtained from $C$ by identifying, for each dyadic number of the form $k/2^n\in \mathopen] 0,1\mathclose[$ (possibly not reduced), its two dyadic expansions. Then $C_n$ is still homeomorphic to the Cantor space, and the inductive limit is naturally homeomorphic to $[0,1]$. 

Q1 and Q2 have a positive answer for all countable groups (conversely a discrete uncountable group cannot bear any proper function). Let $\mu$ be a proper function from $G$ to the positive reals, and view it as a discrete measure on $G$. Assume in addition that $\mu$ grows reasonably, and more precisely satisfies an equality of the form $\mu(gh)\le C_g\mu(h)$ with $C_G\>0$ (e.g. fix a proper subadditive length $|\cdot|$ and define $\mu(g)=|g|+1)$. Then the action of left action of $G$ on itself induces a well-defined left regular representation $\pi$ of $G$ on $\ell^2(G,\mu)$, which is bounded ($\|\pi(g)\|\le C_g^{1/2}$). Let $e$ be the unit in $G$ and $\delta_g$ the Dirac function at $g\in G$. Define $b$ as the coboundary $b(g)=\delta_e-g\delta_e=\delta_e-\delta_g$. Then $\|b(g)\|\ge \mu(g)-\|\delta_e\|$, which is proper; thus $b$ is a proper cocycle. 

The question is motivated by the fact that from the viewpoint of structure theory of algebraic groups $SL_n,~n\geqslant3$ behaves much better than $SL_2$, while modular forms for $SL_2$ seem to be studied more that those for groups of higher ranks. So let me formulate another version of the above question (not sure if it is less vague): 

If you ask the matrices to be unipotent, then, first, you can only get matrices from $SL_n$, and second, three is not enough, the torus is the obstacle. But if you take four upper and lower unipotent triangular matrices, you can do it (still in $SL_n$). For this the keyword is "unitriangular factorisation". 

This is an expansion of my comment. The Smith normal form is a normal form of a matrix with entries in any given PID (but this probably works for non-domains and for Bezout rings in general). It goes as follows: given an $m\times n$ matrix $A$, there exist invertible $m\times m$ and $n\times n$ matrices $B$ and $C$ such that $BAC=\operatorname{diag}(a_1,\ldots,a_r,0,\ldots,0)$. Moreover, the entries $a_i$ satisfy $a_i\mid a_{i+1}$ and are unique up to the multiplication by a unit. This decribes the representatives of $GL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / GL(n,R)$. From here you can obtain the decription for $SL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / SL(n,R)$ — no independent multiplication by a unit anymore, so the difference is the same as between $K_1$ and $SK_1$. When $R$ is a Euclidean ring, one has an algorith for computing the Smith normal form. This works for any PID, in fact, but the resulting matrices $B$ and $C$ are not necessary elementary in this case. For a Euclidean ring the algorithm gives you the chain of elementary transfromation for obtaining the SNF. As you mentioned, $E(n,R)=SL(n,R)$ when $R$ is Euclidean, but this is not the case for a PID. This equality fails, for example, for the ring $S^{-1}\mathbb{Z}[x]$, where $S$ is the multiplicative system generated by all cyclotomic polynomials. This is a result of D. R. Grayson — $SK_1$ of an interesting principal ideal domain. Here are two other links with examples: 

Appendix A hardcore version of the theorem above would be uniform in the lower degree parts of $f$. Theorem? Let $f$, $g$, $P$ and $\mathscr{B}$ be as above. Suppose the polynomial $P^{-d} f(P x)$ has coefficients bounded by some fixed constant $C$. If the singular locus of $g$ has codimension $>(d-1)2^d$ in $\mathbb{C}^k$, then the number of integer solutions to $f(x)=0$ in $P\mathscr{B}$ is $$ C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}P^{k-d}+O_{g,C}(P^{k-d-\delta}) $$ If for each $p$ there is a solution over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with $|\nabla f(x)|_p \geq c(p)$, and there is a real solution $x\in P\mathscr{B}$ with $|\nabla f(P x)| \geq c(\infty)P^d$, then $C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}\gg_{g,C,c} 1$. (Edit: corrected the condition at $\infty$.) The condition on $P^{-d} f(P \bar{x})=0$ just means that if $x\in P\mathscr{D}$ then $f(x)$ is not much larger than the leading part $g(x)$, so that the lower degree parts do not dominate too badly. The alleged proof is the same as the theorem above, but you push on through sections 5 and 6 of Birch's paper with $f$ remaining inhomogeneous. I have not checked this. Modern technology might give a neater proof. I should also mention that everything here would work for systems of several forms, with appropriate changes in the condition on the codimension of the singular locus. 

Corollary 3.7 of the Borel-Tits 1971 Inventiones paper includes: if $K$ is a perfect field, $H$ any connected linear algebraic $K$-group, the maximal unipotent $K$-subgroups of $H$ are the unipotent radicals of minimal parabolic $K$-subgroup of $H$, and those are pairwise conjugate (by elements in $H(K)$). Here "unipotent" does not assume connected (Borel-Tits are very careful with this). In particular, in characteristic $p$, every finite $p$-subgroup of $H(K)$ is contained in the $K$-points of the unipotent radical of a minimal parabolic $K$-subgroup. 

Edit: It took me some time to struggle until I solved the following: in a group $F$, let $m(F)$ be the smallest cardinal of a subset of $F$ whose centralizer is abelian. Find finite groups with $m(F)$ arbitrary large (even finding $F$ with $m(F)\ge 3$ did not seem immediate). Note that $m(A\times B)=\max(m(A),m(B))$, so direct products do not help; $m(F)$ is bounded above by the minimal number of generators, and is 0 for abelian groups. Actually, if we fix a prime $p$ and consider the product of a large family of $n$ non-abelian groups of order $p^3$ and glue their center, so that the resulting group $G$ has order $p^{2n+1}$ and has both its center and its derived subgroup of order $p$, then the centralizer of any noncentral element has index $p$, and hence the centralizer of any family of $k$ elements has index $\le p^k$; on the other hand this group has no abelian subgroup of order $>p^{n+1}$, so $m(G)\ge n+1$ (actually it's an equality). This provides families of $(F_i)$ for which the previous argument does not work.
