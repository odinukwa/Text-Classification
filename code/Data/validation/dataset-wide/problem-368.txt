In my world, an Omniscient creature exists. We don't know how it got here, or if it was created, but it's real, and it's been "willing" to help humans for a long time now. However, every thing we might ask to this being comes with a price : One answer costs one human life, given after the answer. It's omniscient, but it's got its limits : 

In TV shows where characters die, (and we know are going to end up in heaven or resurrected) the other characters have to feel sad, to share emotion with the viewers. It's more enjoyable to watch a show with emotion (whichever it is) rather than no emotion ("meh, he's dead, good for him"). Now for real people, that believe in heaven, it may be just a selfish reaction. They won't see the deceased one until they die, which can take many years, so they're just sad about the time they'll stay separated (or deep down, they don't really believe in heaven). (Or if they do, they know they won't go there because they are not pious enough) 

People - colonists, refugees. Yes, you can "manufacture" them on-site, but assuming the travel time is < 20 years (or just for bootstrapping a new colony), you have to get people from there to here. Bootstrapping for a colony - basically, the stuff you need to build the stuff you need. Once a colony is established, this market dries up entirely, but for a colony that can't do X, a machine to let them do X is worth shipping. Unobtainium. Which goes back to the "can't get it here" issue. If some colony finds Dune Spice and it's useful enough, there will be people willing to pay the transport costs to get it. (Credit to R. in the top-post comments). Refugees - by which I mean folks who aren't trying to go somewhere, so much as needing to get away from where they started. In this context (esp. given the money needed to build this sort of thing), you're probably looking at some rich religion/orthodoxy that builds something relatively self-supporting so they can bugger off and find a brave new land (or Xenu or whatevs). It's crazy and most of them probably won't make it, but human history is full of people packing up and hoping for the best. 

Lasers. You don't need to destroy the debris, just push it out of the way by the slightest amount. The vast majority of space junk is tracked, as others have mentioned, so you'll know what's a threat long before it actually hits. Hit the debris with a laser to alter it's path slightly and you can avoid collisions. Because you can track most of the debris, you can even start this process well in advance. Debris will be speeding past very quickly, but you should be able to hit anything dangerous multiple times as it passes by with each orbit. You can even use this system whenever it's not directly protecting the elevator to slowly reenter space debris as it passes. Just slow down the speed of whatever passes by and eventually stuff will start to fall out of orbit. It cleans up space and protects the elevator all at once! As for the stuff that isn't tracked, you'll need to be able to detect it in advance, so some sort of sensing equipment will be necessary, but you'll need that already for laser targeting. Luckily the stuff that's not tracked is all very small stuff, so it will be easier to push out of the way, and you won't need as much advance notice. 

At this point, the only people awake are your people, your casualties are the guards plus any tech who didn't want to go into SA, and so long as the authorities planet-side aren't tipped off, you're good to go. 

I don't think you need to wake all your mutineers up for this Think about it - you don't need the ship to go somewhere else. You don't need the people to do anything they weren't already doing. All you're trying to change is the circumstances when you arrive. (Borrowing some aspects from Dan's plan above) So your constraints are: 

Regarding the Casimir Effect, I'd give a pretty hard no with a pretty simple reason - the Casimir Effect is an attractive force between two uncharged plates. If you want to create a gun using it, you're going to run into the issue that these two plates are going to hit each other. If anything, the Casimir effect will actually decrease the power of a railgun, as it will work to "suck" the projectile back into the barrel. But even putting that aside and getting to the math, the Casimir effect is really very weak. Its strength is given by $F = \frac{\pi h c}{480 L^4}A$, where $h$ is Plank's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $L$ is the distance between the plates, and $A$ is the area of the two plates. This site gives a quick example to demonstrate just how weak the force really is. Using plates 1 meter square, placed 1 micron apart we get $F=\frac{\pi * 6.6 * 10^{-34} * 3 * 10^8}{480 * 10^{-24}} * 1$ $F = 1.3 mN$ 1.3 micronewtons is not enough force to do anything at all really, so I'd say forget about it. 

A note, though - except for point 1 (edit: and 4), I wouldn't expect any of these transports to be manned. The life-support costs are atrocious, and space travel is notoriously "straight". I would expect unmanned cans that are radio-controlled to get them going, they drift through the stars, and get picked up (and radio-controlled in) at the other side. 

The key point is What does everyone actually know? - and then controlling what they learn and how they interpret it. I don't live near Philly, so anything I'm going to hear about this will be via news reports. I'm literally only going to know what the media tells me. Easy-as-pie in this world of gag orders and national security letters. On the other extreme, anyone close enough to get a clear look at it was likely in the blast radius and thus not in a position to talk to anyone. In the middle are folks who would have saw the streaking light coming down. (Think of that meteor that hit Russia a few years back - even the folks who had cameras pointing at it just see a bright something coming down, then big boom). You simply call it whatever you want it to be called - meteor, nuclear attack, whatever your sneaky government masters want to spin it as. (And even from a kilometer away, you're not going to see much detail, particularly at speed) You mention that satellites caught details. While I think you're overestimating what a satellite can capture (relative speed is a bit of a bitch in photographing things in orbit, especially unexpected things), most of your serious cameras are government controlled. The rest are corporate, which brings us back to government nastygrams telling you that you had an unfortunate data outage, and you have NO IMAGES FROM THAT POINT OF TIME. Now, you just have a disaster scene, and it's pretty easy at this point. Lock down the area, close the roads, send in FEMA and the nuclear guys and everything else. Rig some gadgets to make clicky noises and declare an emergency evac. Get everyone out. Meanwhile, a bunch of MIBs in hazmats happily take care of the "suspect material". To sum up: 

The human civilization on my earth is as advanced as us, no difference is to be noted. Omni cannot be bought or influenced, it will always tell the truth. I would like to know, why would people, in their right minds, consciously use Omni in trials ? Knowing that if they are guilty, they are condemned to death... I was thinking of using Omni as a bluff to frighten other parties (if you are guilty), but if the bluff is called, the price is going to be payed. If nobody were to use it, then only its existence (or the belief of its existence) would be enough for people to be 'honest'. Hence the second question : What if Omni was gone a long time ago, and the government used its image to speed up trials, and criminality all in all. How long would it take for people to notice ? 

See FOOF. Pack some of this into a warhead somehow and I dare you to find a way to make it stop burning. Dioxygen Difluoride is a particularly reactive compound of already particularly reactive fluorine and oxygen. It's ludicrously dangerous production method as well as its reactivity with essentially everything, at any temperature make it fairly famous in the chemistry community. See the wikipedia page for details, but it truly does react with essentially anything. The main difficulty with such a weapon would be that it would tend not to stick to hull of the enemy ship as it decomposed, but this would be a problem with pretty much any reactive agent, which is likely your best bet, aside from nuclear weapons. 

While Omni (as it's called) was used by governments as an executioner at the same time as an informant (hey, might as well use all its functionnalities for a purpose), those governments eventually got all the answers they needed (or maybe they didn't have enough people to execute), so Omni got moved to replace judges in courts. Of course, not all the trials needed Omni (and it's quite costly), but for some trials where both parties claimed they were right and the other was wrong, it could be used. In that case, people knew the price : If a party was found guilty by Omni then one responsible of the felony would be the price to pay (and the others would face their government's justice). There are exceptions of course, if both parties are truly honest and are both equally right (or wrong) then no answer is given, and no payment is needed. Omni is harsh, but not always. To end a trial, Omni can be used as a last resort, but it needs to be accepted by both parties. If a party refuses, then it is considered guilty. It's the way it goes. So in fact, the fear of Omni reveals the truth, most of the time. Thanks to this, since a few decades, trials no longer took ages to end, and the result was always justified. 

People close enough to positively identify what it is are dead. People in the neighborhood to get a good look are busy trying not to be dead, rather than walking a kilometer into the blast zone - and can be easily sent elsewhere "for their safety". Anyone beyond that only know what you tell them. 

I think you've got yourself in a bit of a corner. Without FTL, trading would be nomadic rather than what we think of today - think the old Silk Road, or traveling peddlers. It'll be people whose livelihood involves being constantly on the move, buying stuff here hoping it'll sell for more than that on the other end. (This of course assumes that we don't have transmutation or anything). It may be more feasible if it's combined with an entertainment troupe of some sort (circus being the classic, but even postWW1 barnstormers would fit the model). But, this assumes that it's cost-effective to be roaming the stars in the first place, and that means while you don't need FTL, you do need some sort of high-efficiency power source and sub-light propulsion. Otherwise, it's not worth the trip at all for most things. If we're use near-now tech, that means the only things that are even worth considering shipping is things that the destination planet can't get on their own. (Because if it's available on-planet or even in-system at all, it's cheaper to do it locally than it is to ship it). To my mind, that brings you to three things:
