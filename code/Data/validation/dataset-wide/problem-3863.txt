The McKay correspondence mentioned in Hailong's and Mike's answers extends to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over the invariant rings $R=k[x,y]^G$, where $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL(2,k)$ (with $|G|$ invertible in $k$). In particular (Herzog) all such subrings have only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable MCM modules, that is, they have finite CM type. The converse is true in characteristic zero -- that a two-dimensional complete normal domain over $\mathbb{C}$ of finite CM type is a ring of invariants -- by a result of Auslander. The case $G \subset SL(2,k)$ corresponds to $R$ being Gorenstein, and in particular a hypersurface -- namely the ADE hypersurfaces listed in Mike's answer. The correspondence between the irreducible representations of $G$ and the components of the exceptional fiber extends to include the irreducible MCM modules, and the McKay quiver (aka Dynkin diagram) is the same as the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver. The modules are directly connected to the irreps by Auslander, and directly connected to the components of the fiber by Gonzales-Sprinberg--Verdier and Artin--Verdier, extended to the non-Gorenstein case by Esnault and Wunram. Most of this is in the current draft of my notes with Roger Wiegand on MCM modules, chapters 4, 5, and 6. (Ignore the geometry in Chapter 5 -- it's riddled with errors and I'm currently rewriting it. Or you're welcome to point out errors I might not have noticed yet.) The question of what happens to the Auslander-Reiten-McKay correspondence for $G \not\subset SL(2)$ is addressed in some recent papers of Iyama and Wemyss. (You only get some of the indecomposable MCMs, the so-called special ones.) 

It seems that Bertrand Toen's thesis gives an answer to this question. It's long but appears to be quite thorough. Toen also has an earlier paper where he does Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch for Deligne-Mumford stacks. This material seems to have been subsumed in the paper above, but perhaps it is easier to read here. 

Let G be an algebraic group (or, since the question was tagged as differential geometry, a Lie group). Then if we're given a principal G-bundle $E_G$ and a representation V of G, we get a vector bundle out of this through the associated bundle construction: $(E_G \times V)/G$ is a vector bundle with generic fiber V. Here, G acts on $E_G \times V$ as $g(x,v) = (xg^{-1},gv).$ This shows that fixing a G-bundle determines an exact tensor functor from the category of representations of G to the category of vector bundles. There's a converse to this which says that giving an exact tensor functor from representations of G to vector bundles is equivalent to a G-bundle. 

I'm not sure how to answer the question about intuition. In regards to your second question, the Tannakian formalism works over any field and in fact works for more general categories than Rep(G). A category C is called a neutral Tannakian category over k (k a field) if it is a rigid abelian tensor category together with a k-linear tensor exact functor from C to k-Vect. This latter functor is known as the fiber functor (and is just the forgetful functor referenced in the original post when C = Rep(G)). In this case, there's a theorem that says any neutral Tannakian category is equivalent to the category of representations of an affine group scheme G, where G is given by the tensor automorphisms of the fiber functor. One of the original references for this is a 1982 paper by Deligne and Milne titled 'Tannkian Categories.' Deligne also has an article in the more recent FGA explained. My understanding is that sometimes k can even be replaced by an arbitrary commutative ring. I don't know general conditions under which this holds. However, a great example of the Tannakian formalism in action where k is a general commutative ring is the Mirkovic-Vilonen paper on the geometric Satake correspondence, which they prove in great generality (Ginzburg also has a nice paper on this topic, but only in characteristic zero). The Mirkovic-Vilonen paper can be found here $URL$ In this paper, they prove that their fiber functor is represented by a k-module which is free over k (k any commutative ring here) and hence the Tannakian formalism still works. I don't know if this condition is also a necessary condition. There's also a version of the Tannakian formalism over a scheme, so to speak. If we view a group G as a principal G-bundle on a point and the category of vector spaces as the category of vector bundles on a point, then we can try to generalize to a scheme. Namely, if we fix a G-bundle on a scheme X, then this induces an exact tensor functor from Rep(G) to the category of vector bundles on X using the associated bundle construction. It turns out that the converse holds: given an exact tensor functor from Rep(G) to vector bundles on X, this is equivalent to giving a G-bundle on X. There's a proof of this fact in a set of notes on the webpage for the seminar that Dennis Gaitsgory is currently running. 

The Journal of Commutative Algebra publishes expository/survey papers. Your article on factorization might be appropriate, though I have not looked at it. Disclosure: I am an editor for JCA. 

The $A_\infty$ and $D_\infty$ plane curve singularities have defining equations $x^2=0$ and $x^2y=0$. These equations are "clearly" natural limiting cases of the equations for $A_n$ singularities $x^2 + y^{n+1}=0$ and $D_n$ singularities $x^2y+y^{n-1}=0$ as $n \to \infty$, since large powers are small in the adic topology. So we're tempted to say that $A_\infty$ and $D_\infty$ are "limits" of the "series of singularities" $\{A_n\}$ and $\{D_n\}$. This was already observed by Arnol'd in 1981, who wrote "Although the series undoubtedly exist, it is not at all clear what a series of singularities is." Have there been any attempts since Arnol'd to make sense out of the phrases in quotes in the previous paragraph? That is: 

I've read that quotient singularities (that is, spectra of invariant subrings of finite groups acting linearly on polynomial rings) have rational singularities. Is there an elementary proof of this fact in dimension two? I have one proof, but it uses big guns like Grothendieck spectral sequences etc. 

One problem in the proof is that $\operatorname{pd}_R(R/I)$ might be infinite, so you can't apply Auslander-Buchsbaum the final time. I can't seem to come up with an example where $M$ has finite projective dimension while $\operatorname{ann} M$ has infinite projective dimension, but they must exist. Later: The famous Dutta-Hochster-McLaughlin example does the trick. It is a module $M$ of finite projective dimension over $R = k[x,y,z,w]/(xy-zw)$, with annihilator $(x,y,z,w)^3 + (x,z)$. 

I think the following should work for $\mu.$ If $F \in m^i,$ then both derivatives of $F$ live in $m^{i-1}.$ Denoting the ideal generated by the partial derivatives by $J_F,$ it follows that $J_F \subset m^{i-1}.$ Then $(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/J_F)/(m^{i-1}/J_F) \simeq \mathbb{C}[x,y]/m^{i-1}.$ This shows that $\mu = \frac{i(i-1)}{2} + \text{dim }m^{i-1}/J_F.$ I think (and this should probably be verified) that this latter dimension is minimized when the two generators of $J_F$ are two generators for $m^{i-1}.$ We could then assume, for example, that $J_F = (x^{i-1}, y^{i-1}).$ Then $\text{dim }m^{i-1}/J_F = i-2$ (with a basis given by $x^{i-2}y, \ldots, xy^{i-2}$). Putting this together gives a minimum $\mu$ value as $\frac{i(i-1)}{2} + i-2.$ I notice that this disagrees with Roy Smith's answer above when $i>2$ (my answer is smaller). Perhaps I've made a mistake somewhere? 

Ben gave the general answer above. If you care specifically about the symplectic group and are interested in a "flag-like" description of its flag variety, then one exists. It is given by all half-flags of isotropic subspaces (this is just like for $SL_n$, the symplectic group acts transitively and the stabilizer of the standard half-flag will be the standard Borel). With this description, it's just as straightforward computing Springer fibers and the like as it is for the $SL_n$ case, which you're presumably familiar with. A reference for these flag-like descriptions can be found in the section of Fulton and Harris on "Homogeneous Spaces" (there's a similar description for the special orthogonal groups). 

$\mathrm{Ext} = \mathrm{Ext}^1$ does not classify the middle terms up to isomorphism. It classifies the short exact sequences up to equivalence, where the equivalence relation is generated by commutative diagrams having equalities on each end. It's possible for two inequivalent short exact sequences to have isomorphic middle terms. See Eisenbud's book, Exercises A3.26, A3.27, and especially A3.29 for more. As for your particular example, consider the pullback of the exact sequence $0 \to \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/(3) \to 0$ by the map given by multiplication by 2 on $\mathbb{Z}/(3)$. The middle term is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, but the short exact sequence is not equivalent to the original. 

No. $R = k[x,y]/(xy)$, $M = R/(x)$. The zero module has infinite depth and support of dimension $-\infty$, so should not be considered MCM. 

R.Y. Sharp proved in the 80s that a Noetherian ring with a dualizing complex must be "acceptable". This is a weakening of "excellent" obtained by replacing every occurence of the word "regular" with "Gorenstein", so means (1) universally catenary, (2) Gorenstein formal fibers, and (3) Gorenstein locus open in any finitely generated algebra. There is an example due to Ferrand and Raynaud of a one-dimensional noetherian domain for which the generic formal fiber is not Gorenstein. Such a ring does not, by Sharp's result, have a dualizing complex. 

Highest weight theory is ideally suited to answer just this sort of question. Here's how to figure out your problem. 

Yes, the square root of a line bundle $L$ is a line bundle $L'$ such that $(L')^{\otimes 2} \simeq L.$ I don't know of any general criteria for detecting the existence of a square root. A couple basic observations: 

This is not a complete answer, but should hopefully be a start. Given a point $x \in \mathcal{F}$, the dimension of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$ is given by picking an atlas $X$ of $\mathcal{F}$, and then computing \begin{equation} dim_x(\mathcal{F}) = dim_x(X) - dim(Aut_{\mathcal{F}}(x)). \end{equation} The dimension of $\mathcal{F}$ is then the supremum of its dimension at all its points. Given surjective, representable $\phi:\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$, we obtain a surjective map of atlases $X \to Y$. Therefore $dim_x(X) \geq dim_{\phi(x)}(Y)$ for all points $x$. So, we're reduced to comparing $Aut_{\mathcal{F}}(x)$ to $Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(\phi(x))$. There is necessarily a surjection $Aut_{\mathcal{F}}(x) \to Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(\phi(x))$, so there is a question of how much larger the automorphisms of $x$ in $\mathcal{F}$ are compared to those of $\phi(x)$ in $\mathcal{G}$. That is, we would need to verify that \begin{equation} dim_x(X) - dim_{\phi(x)}(Y) \geq dim(Aut_{\mathcal{F}}(x)) - dim(Aut_{\mathcal{G}}(\phi(x))) \end{equation} holds for all points $x$. I feel like this should be true just because my possibly faulty intuition says that the relative dimension of the automorphisms of a surjective, representable map won't exceed the relative dimension of the atlases. However, I don't see how to prove it right now. Does anyone know how to prove this, or provide a counterexample? 

If I were going to propose a new construction as a "replacement for resolution of singularities", what properties would my replacement have to have? [I am going to do no such thing -- this is purely speculative.] Is there a shortish list of theorems such that any construction verifying the properties on the list would thereby deserve to be called a resolution of singularities? 

I'm promoting this comment to an answer, since it appears no one else is jumping in with a proof. Prop. 2 of this paper by Eisenbud attributes it 'essentially' to Berger, and has a sketch of a proof. 

In general, there are many many more reflexive modules than projective modules. As pointed out in another answer, every second syzygy is reflexive, and not necessarily projective (unless your ring happens to be regular of dimension at most $2$). Thus the converse of that answer is, I think, more interesting. In particular, assume that $R$ is (semi)local. Then there are only finitely many indecomposable projectives. If there are finitely many indecomposable reflexives, then $R$ must have dimension at most $2$, and thus finite Cohen-Macaulay type (which is a very rare condition). The moral is that reflexivity is a (very) much weaker condition than projectivity. 

Socle dimension 2. Not Gorenstein. Alternative method: find a regular sequence of length 3 and kill it. Here's one found by trial and error: 

The geometric Eisenstein series is quite complicated, see the paper by Gaitsgory and Braverman $URL$ As the authors point out, a naive guess for the geometric Eisenstein functor would be the functor from sheaves on T-Bundles to sheaves on G-Bundles (T is a maximal torus of G) given by pulling back to sheaves on B-Bundles and then pushing forward to sheaves on G-Bundles. However, they explain that the fact that the map from B-Bundles to G-Bundles is not proper introduces problems, making it so that the geometric Eisenstein series does not behave as expected. For this reason, they have to replace B-Bundles by their Drinfeld compactification and (for others reasons they explain) also tensor with the IC sheaf of the Drinfeld compactification to get the correct functor (note that the Drinfeld compactification is singular, so the IC sheaf is not just the constant sheaf). 

Then these Dynkin diagrams correspond to all possible finite subgroups of $SL_2.$ The relation is given by special classes of isolated surface singularities known as Kleinian or Du Val singularities. These arise as follows. Given a finite subgroup $G \subset SL_2,$ we have an action of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ with no fixed points other than the origin. If we then look at the geometric quotient $\mathbb{C}^2/G$ corresponding to $G$-invariant polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[x,y],$ it is generated by three homogeneous polynomials $f_1, f_2, f_3$ which are related by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $g$ of degree 3 such that $g(f_1, f_2, f_3) = 0.$ We can then identify $\mathbb{C}^2/G$ with the hypersurface $\{ g = 0 \} \subset \mathbb{C}^3.$ The resulting hypersurfaces have the following equations (with corresponding subgroup):
