... and many more. Basically whatever you can think of. But however magic works in your universe, it should be treated as an alternative technology, rather than an alternative to technology. 

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." -Arthur C. Clarke (more info) In other words, you should treat magic like another form of technology. Other answers have tried to argue that using magic over technology precludes the need for both education and research, but in all magic systems I can think of: 

Summary If you are looking to make a lava lake that creatures can plausibly swim through, a mixture of super high temperatures and compositions of iron and magnesium will most likely yield the best results. 

Water is not necessary for a planet to have an atmosphere. Planets like Mars have atmospheres without there being water on the planet. (It is worth noting that Mars' atmosphere is about 100x thinner than Earth's, but that is due to its lack of magnetic field rather than any lack of water. In fact, the article just linked states that its thin atmosphere is the reason all the surface water on Mars dried up.) Even if you need a human-breathable atmosphere, there is no need for water vapor. As explained in this answer, the atmospheric pressure and relative amounts of different gasses in the atmosphere will have a much greater effect on an atmosphere's breathability than the presence or absence of water will. As for humans needing drinking water to survive on the planet in the first place, you could have it shipped in from other planets if space travel is available, or have moisture farmers (sort of Luke's aunt and uncle on Tatooine) that mine or gather water from the sparse underground sources you mentioned. 

A previous version of this answer had some language and insinuations that were abrasive and my intentions were not clear. I apologize for that, particularly to the OP, as well as to all the users at large as I do value my inclusion in this community. I have re-written the answer as follows... Let me come at this from another angle: If the character who is ordering the tower to be built is a tyrant, then yes, an ivory tower is feasible. It would take a tyrannical type personality to even want an ivory tower and it would take a tyrant to kill all the elephants required to build anything that could be considered a tower. That is just my opinion, but I believe it to be true. Truly rich and powerful people just don't do that sort of thing or else Jeff Besos, Warren Buffet, and Bill Gates would have ivory towers. So if your character is a tyrant he can send out all his minions to kill all the elephants they can find and bring back their tusks. Then he'd have his slaves (a tyrant would have those too) build the thing for him. Now I imagine that he'd need to have built a structure of some kind first (wooden, brick, etc.) to put the ivory on. Ivory itself wouldn't be the building material. Not good for that. There are some carvings made of the stuff, but not huge structures. So some of your needs might not be met - He probably would drive the local elephant population to extinction, and depending on how arrogant this tyrant is he might want a really big tower, so he might send his minions all over the world for even more ivory, thus widening the influence of how wiped out the elephants could be. And the tower would not be 100% ivory. It needs an initial structure to hang the ivory on, as ivory itself its not a great building material. This answer assumes modern day technology where we don't have magical or sci-fi means of "creating" ivory, and it also assumes the "cool" factor (from the OP's question) that would come with having real ivory as opposed to an artificial or manufactured version of it. 

One scientist referred to lobotomies as "surgically induced childhood," which would certainly be a solution to a criminal having too much intellect for their own good. 2. Brain-eating creatures In some universes there are creatures that feed upon the brains of humans, while leaving the rest of their bodies intact. For example, Mind Flayers in D&D or Ceti Eels in Star Trek both affect the brains of sentient beings in a very damaging way. However, this method has the greatest potential for getting out of hand and reducing the victim to a vegetative state, or killing them completely -- therefore, those inflicting the punishment would need to exert strict control over the creature that was unleashed on the victim's brain, stopping them as soon as their brain has been damaged enough. 3. Intellect-affecting spells If magic is a part of your world, a permanent variation of a Confusion or Curse spell could very effectively prevent their scheming. Another option is a spell of Bad Luck, which if powerful enough (and again, permanent) could effectively prevent them from making any significant intellectual breakthrough, thus foiling all their plans before they even happen. 

Piggybacking on this question: Can you simply scale up animals? how CAN we scale up living creatures to be giant sized? What would need to done to make truly giant animals (Dragons, Kong, Godzilla, etc.) possible? Land creatures, flying creatures, ocean creatures, included. All the questions I've found pretty much say that it can't be done. Fine. But if we were to try to create said creature, what would we have to do? As the previous question states its just not possible, I get that. So let's assume in this fictional universe there's some super science technology and that said technologies users are creating the creature from scratch or manipulating an existing creatures DNA to make the changes necessary. Don't just say "magic" though please. For example: Bones and muscles made of denser but lighter material? Multiple hearts to get the blood pumping? Some cavity(s) in the body filled with a gas that makes the creature more buoyant? Brain with extra organ(s) that can send out greater/faster commands to the body? Even changes to the creatures environments are welcomed if necessary, though I'd rather focus on the creature itself. EDIT: Some more details- Earth gravity and environment, and no more than 24m / 80ft tall. EDIT: I wanted to add these pics to give a kind of scale to the size of creatures that have existed IRL. That really big Brachiosaur in both pics must give us some ideas. 

tend to have a harder time flowing past each other, and thus are more viscous. Some examples of real-life lava materials, in order of decreasing viscosity (again from this wikipedia page): 

Basically, even for viscous materials, heat tends to destroy any bonds between the molecules, allowing them to slide past each other more easily, and making the liquid less viscous. Chemical composition plays a big part too Viscosity can be defined as "resistance in the flow of a liquid." Therefore, materials with molecules that: 

Depending on the tech level of your world, I see a few different solutions being plausible. 1. A lobotomy (as mentioned by A.C.A.C. in the comments) reduces the amount of complexity a person's brain can handle, by simply cutting out a portion of the physical brain. Lobotomies were widely used as a treatment for mental disorders in the 1940s and 50s: 

$URL$ That might help you understand something about predators. Basically if too many predators live in one area they will eat off all the prey in that area. Nature makes it so that the predators spread themselves out over wider areas so that each predator has enough prey. In short your area will not have SO many predators that humans have to run from them all the time. But... I get that you want monsters killing people, so how about this: they build their towns and farms on fields abutted by natural cliffs. 

An ancient airplane is found amongst the ruins. Against all odds it still works! One man learns how to fly it and he is hailed as a god! A religion forms around the flying machine and the future is set! "All hail the air plane! It brings you closer to god!" Why would you ever want to stay on the ground in a dumb old car when you can soar in the sky, where god is! A plane can get to wherever you're going faster anyway! May god and the Wright Brothers bless you!
