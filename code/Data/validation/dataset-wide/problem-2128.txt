As a rule of thumb, while a degree can be important for getting your foot in the door at a company, once you're in, it's unlikely to matter. You're judged on results, not qualifications on paper. (At better companies, anyway; as always, there will be exceptions.) There's one important caveat: if you're planning on roles senior enough to take you overseas, it's often very difficult to get a working visa without a university degree. 

Yes. Odds are it's an honest mistake and they can reaccommodate, particularly if you're asking to do the interview earlier, which won't slow down things. Of course, it's possible they can't change the date and you'll need to decide between going to the interview and going on holiday, but you have nothing to lose by checking. 

No. Any sort of work for remuneration, for any duration in the United States, requires a temporary work visa. On a B-1 (business) or B-1/2 (business/tourism) visa, you can only legally: 

If you need accommodation due to personal health issues (immune system compromised etc), most companies would view that as reasonable and HR would likely back you up. Even if this was the case, you should discuss this in advance with your manager so you can work out the best arrangements for both of you. However, in this particular case, your concerns sound rather excessive. It's far more likely that your coworkers have the common cold than whooping cough (aka pertussis, it's the same thing), which is very rare, particularly in adults; the outbreak you mention has made the news precisely because it's so rare! Even if they did have it, if you yourself have been vaccinated, it's highly unlikely that you would catch it from them; and last but not least, if you did get it, the bug would have to make a final leap from you to your kids. All three factors lining up is pretty unlikely, particularly when compared to the typical way whooping cough spreads directly from child to child in daycare. I would still advise you to raise your concerns with your manager, but from a company productivity point of view: sick people should be encouraged to rest at home, or at least work from home, so they don't spread their illness to the rest of the company. Even an ordinary flu can be a major drain on productivity if it takes out half the team for a few days. Last but not least, if you're not vaccinating your kids on purpose and there's whooping cough around, you have only yourself to blame if they do catch it at day care, the playground, the supermarket... 

Relax. As a customer-facing singleton, you have quite a bit of job security because there's nobody who can easily replace you! Nobody else can do technical on-site visits to or run workshops etc for EMEA customers, and even a simple phone call would require that somebody in US HQ get up at dark o'clock. And if Sales thinks you're doing a great job with this, and apparently you are, you're golden and they would be nuts to fire you. The actual problem you're going to have is career advancement: do you have room to grow without moving to HQ? But that's really a separate question. 

You can ask as much as you like, but how much the company is willing to wait depends on the company size and situation. If you're joining a giant company like Google or Facebook as a generic software developer and haven't been assigned to a particular project, the answer is probably "quite long", and two months is likely fine. A friend of mine at Google asked for, and received, almost a year off before he started -- although he was hit by a sudden family crisis near the end of the interview process and moving to a new country for the job, so this is definitely at the extreme end of the scale. But if you're joining a small company that needs somebody to fix the frobnicator so it stops discombobulating the widgets right now, they're unlikely to be able to wait even two weeks. This would hopefully have been made clear at the interview stage though. The other alternative is to use your stock vesting as leverage when it's offer negotiation time: if they can offer you a sufficiently large signup bonus to make up for the loss, you don't need to wait two months, and everybody wins! 

I would push back and question the assumptions behind the requirement. Assuming employees have access to customer data on their computers, there are countless other ways to "smuggle" out data. For example, they can take screenshots (the ability to do this is built into most all OS's), or copy and paste as text, or export into another format; or just plain old save to disk, etc; then send out via email, or paste into a web form, or copy onto a USB key, or transfer via Bluetooth, etc. There was a case a while back (can't remember the details) where somebody copied confidential data into drafts of emails, then copied the drafts outside the office and deleted them -- hey presto, data out, no traces whatseoever. And a nefarious, technically skilled and/or professional adversary will come up with lots more: for starters, have you seen the kind of places you can hide a camera these days? So unless you're willing to go full-on Pentagon when it comes to your security measures (body searches on entry and exit, airgapped network, completely locked down workstations, regular sweeps for rogue wifi and other transmitting devices, etc) and bear the costs, telling employees that they can't use/bring in their mobiles is just going to sap productivity, lower morale, waste time and cost money, all without addressing the actual problem. Convincing the customer about this will, of course, be the tricky part. You could tell them that you care about their security, and you're willing to implement the Pentagon-style security if they're willing to pay for it, here's how much it will cost you. Or you could adopt a fig leaf approach: bundle the people working on super secret customer data into a separate room and make them all swear a super secret pinky promise to leave their phones in the magic basket outside when they enter. 

Well, yes, it looks pretty bad if your stated reason for leaving is "can't get get along with coworker". However, you're the one in control of your job search, so you can spin it more positively. The IT industry is pretty mobile and 6 months is not going to ring too many alarm bells, particularly if your previous engagement was longer and if you weren't fired. Perhaps you're leaving because (say) the job didn't offer you the opportunity for growth that you expected, and that's why New Job looks much better? In any case, the key is that you grit your teeth for a bit longer, find a new job while still working there, and only then quit. Otherwise explaining why you left will be more difficult. As an aside, your situation sounds rather odd to me, you might want to bring this up with your manager and/or explore other roles in the company if this co-worker of yours is the only problem. 

HR will not care, unless the company you're applying to is the client. If the relationship between the IT services company you worked for and the client is public, I see no harm in mentioning it on your CV. But if the relationship is not public knowledge, it's the client and/or former employer that may be upset, not the new company. In general, though, unless you happen to work in a field like web design where a public portfolio is important, naming the clients you worked for is just a waste of space. A new employer cares about what you can do for them, not who you did things for in the past. 

You need to spin this so that there are clear benefits to the company. I'd try this approach: "To fix that problem we had, I extended open source tool X and it's working great. I'd like to contribute my changes back to the original version, so we get bug fixes, new features and community support for free. What do you think?" 

In companies large enough to hire full-time recruiters, it's common to do a pre-interview phone screen (aka "pulse check") where the recruiters asks a set of questions with predetermined set of answers. They can then see how many of these you get "right", and pass candidates who do well enough to the actual interview. It's easy to fall into the ego trap of "why are they insulting my intelligence like this!", but interviews are expensive to companies and there are a lot of candidates with shiny resumes and next to no actual skills to back them up. So if done well, with pre-screen questions that have a limited set of correct answers, this is a decent bozo filter. In your particular case, of course, the questions were not. The first question sounds like a warm-up question where the answer is essentially meaningless, the second sounds completely inappropriate for this, and the third sounds like she was expecting you just to spell out the acronyms: "LAN stands for Local Area Network, WAN is Wide Area Network, TCP/IP is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol". In any case, all you need to do is give the simplest possible answer and elaborate only if asked to do so. Otherwise, you may end up like this guy. It's also worth noting that any decent company will pass the results to the hiring manager (who hopefully is technical), who may be able to identify answers that are correct but nonstandard. 

Now there are a number of exceptions, but these are for very specific purposes generally involving employees of foreign companies sent to the US to install/service/consult and would most likely not apply to "doing certain projects". 

A startup I previously worked at fixed this problem by designating music rooms and quiet rooms. What's more, the music-friendly rooms were designated "Rammstein" (a famously loud German metal band) and "Non-Rammstein" to indicate the expected style of music! Of course, the complication here is that this may fragment teams based on music taste as opposed to what they're working on. The other option, which seems to be pretty standard these days, is to ban public music outright and require people to use headphones. You're not going to make many friends with this approach though. As for how to raise this, I would talk to your boss, not HR, and style this as a productivity issue: you can't concentrate, people can't collaborate, sales can't call customers, etc. It would be even better if you can find other people who share your point of view (is there anybody else wearing headphones?), and have a ready solution like the music room/quiet room approach. HR ignoring your complaints about the toilet or your chair is really another question, but to check, are you sure HR is the right place to talk to about this kind of thing anyway? Usually HR is for people issues, and there's a separate facilities/maintenance department. And if you need a new chair, buying a replacement is probably within your boss's domain to authorize. 

At my company, all of those tasks are handled by what are now known as "office administrators", the current euphemism for secretaries. This job is pretty low on the totem pole at most companies, so as a Java programmer with work experience, your friend would likely be considered severely overqualified. If they did manage to wrangle their way into such a position, they'd be looking at a major paycut, and it would look equally awkward on her CV if she ever changed their mind and wanted to get back into IT. HR's actual job is dealing with people, but as interchangeable human resources (hence the name) akin to lumps of coal, not as friends. So they handle hiring people, pretending to help them as long as this aligns with the company's interests, and firing them when it doesn't. (To be clear, HR doesn't call the shots on this, they only execute management's orders.) Instituting and enforcing company policies to ensure the companies comply with the law is also within their remit. Depending on company size and structure, they may also need to handle things like recruitment and payroll. It's not generally regarded as a "fun" job, but it does usually pay a little better than an office admin. But, again, there's no obvious career path from IT to HR. I'd suggest your friend reconsider and find out exactly what she dislikes about her current job. If she doesn't like spending 99% of her time sitting alone in a cubicle staring at a screen, find a company that does pair programming and has teams that work together. If she wants to work more with people and still leverage her IT skills (and get an IT salary), a discipline like usability/UX might be a viable choice.
