This matter is discussed in Tennison's "sheaf theory". He defines manifolds your way and writes (p. 90): "...the above definition is in accordance with the more usual definitions in terms of atlases of charts with transition maps of the appropriate kind[...], with two possible exceptions. Some authors may require that $X$ have a countable basis of open sets. Other authors may insist that $(X,\mathcal{O}_X )$ satisfy a separation (hausdorff) condition..." You might also be interested in the treatment "Smooth Manifolds and Observables" by Jet Nestruev, where manifolds are characterised by their ring of smooth functions (it has to be "geometric"). Last but not least you might take a look at "Algebraic Geometry over C-infinity rings" by Dominic Joyce, $URL$ where "classical" differential geometry is widely generalised (in the sense of Spivak's derived manifolds). 

I want to verify the following claim that I found in some paper. Suppose f is a smooth real-valued function on the real line satisfying $f'(x)x-f(x)\ge x^2$ for all x. Then there is a constant C, s.t. $f(x)\ge \frac{x^2}{2}-C$ for all $x.$ The connection with the title is that the authors claim that any function satisfying the first inequality is of quadratic growth, i.e. satisfies the second inequality. 

For a general submanifold P the problem you pose is not a Fredholm problem. In particular, you cannot expect your moduli space to be finite-dimensional. This has to do with admissible boundary conditions for the Cauchy-Riemann equation (buzzword: totally real boundary condition). I am not so sure about the dimension of the moduli space. However I do know that the dimension can be read off from the Fredholm index of the linearized problem. I would expect some Maslov index to appear. 

Let $O$ be an open subset of the separable Hilbert space $H.$ Let $E$ be a separable Banach space. Is it true that $C^0_b(O;E),$ the space of bounded continuous maps $O\rightarrow E$, endowed with the $C^0$-norm, is separable? If YES, where can I find I proof of this fact? 

Not really an answer, but I had a similar problem a while ago (I wanted to know the cohomology ring of certain non-free quotients). My supervisor told me to look at Bredon homology, but I found something different to work on. Might be worth a try! 

Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of the upper half-plane in the complex plane. I am considering the following problem: (1) $\overline{\partial}u=f,$ $\textrm{Im} f=0$ on the real line for maps complex-valued maps on $\Omega.$ Here, $\overline{\partial}$ denotes the classical Cauchy-Riemann operator. Usually one considers (1) as posed in the space (of complex-valued maps lying in) $W^{1,p}$ for $p>2$ because by Sobolev embedding elements of $W^{1,p}$ are actually continuous and the boundary condition is then well-defined. One then has elliptic regularity in the sense that if $u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ solves (1) for $f\in W^{k,p}(\Omega),$ then $u\in W^{k+1,p}_{loc}(\Omega)$ with corresponding estimates. (By usually I mean the references on J-holomorphic cures like Salamon-McDuff's books or the book by Abbas-Hofer.) I am actually looking for the corresponding statement for $p\in(1,2].$ Namely consider the space $W^{1,p}(\Omega)\times W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ (now both spaces consist of real-valued maps and correspond to real and imaginary part), where $W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ is the closure of compactly-supported smooth $u\in C^{\infty}(\Omega),$ s.t. $\textrm{supp } u$ is disjoint from the real axis. Is it then true that a weak solution $u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega)\times W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ of $\overline{\partial}u=f$ with $f\in W^{k,p}$ is in fact in W^{k+1,p}? As I already mentioned the literature I came across only treats the case $p>2.$ Notice also that it does not suffice to use regularity theory for the Laplace operator, since one only gets local regularity for the real part (i.e. no regularity up to the boundary). 

I am interested in Morse homology on the loop space of a given compact (Riemannian) manifold. A small perturbation renders the geodesic action ("energy") functional Morse. Now I am interested in the Morse-Smale property, i.e. for any critical points x and y the unstable manifold of x intersects the stable manifold of y transversally. Could anyone please provide a reference that a generic choice of metric on the loop space yields the Morse-Smale property? (Notice that the correct choice of perturbations of the metric is part of the problem.) I have difficulties finding an appropriate reference for this. There seem to be two obvious ways to realize Morse-Smale transversality in this setting: 1. The abstract way: Here one considers a given Hilbert manifold with a metric. The space of perturbations consist of (some class of) metrics which are uniformly equivalent to the given one. This is for instance the approach followed by Abbondandolo/Majer: "Lectures on Morse homology for infinite-dimensional manifolds". The problem with this reference is that their space of perturbations is too big - the space in question is not separable. In particular the Sard-Smale theorem, which is crucial in this setting, cannot be applied. I have difficulties in writing down a separable Banach space of perturbations which is still enough to provide surjectivity of the linearized "master section". 2. The concrete setting: Obviously, it is not enough to consider metrics on the loop space which come from metrics on the base manifold. I do not know whether it suffices to consider metrics on the loop space which come from metrics on the base times $S^1.$ My problem is that the "master section" involves the gradient (w.r.t. the induced metric on the loop space) of the perturbed energy functional in question. I have no clue how to obtain a useful formula for its linearization. So, could anyone please give me a hint about solving 1. or 2.? It is also possible that pursuing the paths 1. or 2. might not be a clever idea, in which case I would appreciate any advice. 

Given a compact Riemannian manifold (with a fixed metric) and a Morse function on it (also fixed). Is there a bound (depending on the metric and the Morse function) on the length of the Morse trajectories? (You can assume the Morse-Smale condition if helpful.) EDIT (In response to Dick's answer): The Morse function and the metric are fixed. I am just looking for something like $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\| \nabla f(\phi_t(p))\|dt\leq C$ and $C=C(f,g)$ where $f$ is the Morse function in question, $g$ stands for the metric and $\phi$ denotes the flow of $-\nabla f$. Note here that the constant is independent of the starting point $p$, as it is easy to see that such a constant additionally depending on $p$ exists (you use the hyperbolicity of $\nabla f$ to deduce exponential convergence towards a critical point). Furthermore it is also easy to see that the above integral is bounded if you include a $2$ in the exponent of the norm (a.k.a. $L^2$), as $\| \nabla f(\phi_t(p))\|^2=-\frac{d}{dt}f(\phi_t(p)).$ EDIT2 (In response to Bill's answer): I changed the statement to make it abundantly clear that the bound may depend on the metric and the Morse function. Maybe I was somewhat unclear in my formulation - sorry for that. 

Both the kernel of a linear operator and the integral kernel come from the German word "Kern". Both are translations of it. In German "Kern" means kernel, core, nucleus at the same time. Furthermore, for instance, the place where the seeds are in an apple are also called "Kern". As in English, it refers to something central or essential (as in the integral or in the Earth (the core, "Erdkern")), but also as something hidden (as in an apple or for the linear operator). It might be that this variety of meanings might be lost when you translate it into English. 

Let $Q$ be a compact Riemannian manifold. Then $\Lambda Q\rightarrow Q,$ $\gamma\mapsto \gamma(0)$ can be shown to be a locally trivial fiber bundle of Hilbert manifolds. Here, $\Lambda Q$ denotes the space of maps $S^1\rightarrow Q$ of Sobolev class $W^{1,2}.$ Question: Who proved it first? Is there an appropriate reference? I once read it attributed to Klingenberg, but didn't find the proof (nor the statement) in the corresponding reference. I only know a proof due to Abbondandolo/Schwarz, but they claim no originality when asked. 

From the perspective of analysis it is usually more convenient to define your favorite class of function spaces via local coordinates and a partition of unity. More precisely consider your favorite (compact manifold) and choose a covering $U_i$ together with charts $\phi_i:B_1\rightarrow U_i,$ where $B_1$ denotes the unit ball in your model space and such that $\phi$ extends to the closures, and a partition of unity $(\chi_i)$ subordinate to your covering. The you define $\|f\|_{W^{k,p}(M)}:=\sum_i \|\phi_i^\ast (\chi_if)\|_{W^{k,p}(B_1)}$ for $f\in C^\infty(M).$ This norm is independent of the choices as long as $M$ is compact and its closure is a Banach space. Vector bundles can be treated similarly. Of course this defines a norm which equivalent to choosing a metric and a connection $\nabla$ and to consider $\|f\|:=\|\nabla^k f\|_{L^p}+\|f\|_{L^p},$ as in Spiro's answer. 

The moment map condition is a precise form of Noether's theorem. Whenever you have an $G$-invariant Hamiltonian, its flow will preserve the value of the moment map. That is in some sense the moment map condition: $\mu:(M,\omega)\rightarrow \mathfrak{g}^*$ should be equivariant and satisfy $\langle d \mu(x).v,\xi\rangle=\omega(\xi_M(x),v)$ for all $v\in T_x M$ and $\xi\in \mathfrak{g}$ Now consider the flow $\phi^t$ of the $G$-invariant Hamiltonian $H$. Then you compute $\frac{d}{dt}|_0 \langle\mu(\phi^t(x)),\xi\rangle=\langle d\mu(x).X_H(x),\xi\rangle=\omega(\xi_M(x),X_H (x))=dH(x).\xi_M(x)=\frac{d}{dt}|_0 H(e^{t\xi}.x)=0$ since H is $G$-invariant. There is also a motivation from symplectic reduction, but I don't know whether that is really relevant at the beginning. Please don't be discouraged by this "bracket stuff". I don't consider it particularly enlightening anyway... 

I think you should just take a look at the following paper: $URL$ (In particular it should exponential convergence.) Should there still be question, you might post them! 

We have $\|D^2h-DD^\ast h\| \le \|D-D^*\|_{L^\infty(M,T^\ast M\otimes End(T^\ast M\otimes TM))} \|Dh\|,$ proving the uniform equivalence of the metrics. Notice that the difference of two connections is an ordinary tensor field, whose $L^\infty$-norm is bounded due to the compactness of $M$. Another way to see this is that both metrics are locally equivalent to the metric $\xi\mapsto \|\nabla^2\xi\|+\|\xi\|,$ where now $\nabla$ refers to the "flat" connection and the $L^2$-norm refers to the local Lebesgue measure. Since $M$ is compact it can be covered by a finite number of such neighborhoods and in particular both norms are equivalent. EDIT: I will keep the stuff I wrote at first (I thought of $D^\*$ as a connection as well, which is not true, as Brian pointed out), but the correct answer involves elliptic regularity. I will consider the following simpler version (which also implies the general case, but once this simpler case is understood the more complicated case becomes easy.). Let $\nabla$ be a connection on $M.$ Then the following two norms are equivalent ($f\in C^\infty(M)$): 1. $\|f\|\_{W^{2,2}}, $ 2. $\|\Delta f\|\_{L^2}+\|f\|\_{L^2}.$ Clearly the second norm is dominated by the first. The other inequality follows from the elliptic estimate $\|D^2 f\|\_{L^2}\leq \|\Delta f\|\_{L^2},$ valid for $f\in C^\infty\_0(R^n),$ which is actually trivial to prove. 

Suppose a Hilbert space W can be written as the direct sum (not necessarily orthogonal) of the closed subspaces H and V, where H is assumed to be of finite dimension. Define a new inner product via ||h+v||^2:=q(h)+|v|^2, where |.| denotes the original norm on the Hilbert space and q is a positive definite quadratic form on H (one can assume w.l.o.g. q=|.|^2). QUESTION: Are |.| and ||.|| equivalent? ||.||^2 is easily seen to be dominated by 2|.|^2, but I don't know about the other direction. (Also notice that the question is obviously true if V and H were orthogonal!) 

Let $c$ be a $W^{1,2}$-curve into a (compact Riemannian) manifold $Q,$ defined on some open interval $I$. Let $t_0\in I$ and $\xi_0\in T_{c(t_0)}Q$ be arbitrary. I am looking for a citeable reference for the following statement: There is a unique $W^{1,2}$-vector field $\xi$ along $c$ satisfying (i) $\nabla_{\dot{c}}\xi=0$ a.e. on $I$ (ii) $\xi(t_0)=\xi_0.$ Notice that the statement above could be deduced from the standard Picard-Lindelöf theorem if $c$ was sufficiently regular (i.e. e.g. $c$ was $C^1$). 

At first I always thought about the deRham theorem in terms of vector analysis and fluid dynamics. For instance, if one has a curl-free vector field, then one might want to write it as a gradient field of a function. But if your domain has holes (of a certain kind) this will not necessarily be true. The analogous statement holds true for divergence-free vector fields that you want to write as the curl of another vector field. 

I agree with your views concerning coordinate-freeness. Furthermore I find the work of Richard Melrose very inspiring since he is - although clearly dealing with pde and index theory - at every step concerned with explicit coordinate-invariance of the statements. Thus his stuff can be clearly understood agreed upon by a differential topologist. Here ist his homepage, look yourself: $URL$ Look for example at his blow-up explanations or the stuff on Fourier transformation and pseudodifferential operators from a differential topologist's perspective. 

I think this concerns the moduli space of flat connections on Riemann surfaces with punctures (aka holes). If there is at least one puncture \pi_1 of the Riemann surface is a free group and the moduli space in question reduces to the moduli space of (G-valued) representations of the free group (in some letters). Hence you need to study so-called character varieties, see e.g. $URL$ You might also have a look at $URL$ For some general stuff see also $URL$ 

Consider 1 < $p<\infty$ and an integer $k$. Does interior elliptic regularity for the Laplacian also hold in the Sobolev space $W^{k,p}$ of negative order? More precisely I am interested in the following question: Let $u\in W^{-1,p}(R^n)$ be a distributional solution of $\Delta u=Su,$ where $S$ is smooth. Is it then true that $u$ is smooth? 

I am looking for a reference treating the slice theorem for Banach Lie group actions on Banach manifolds, i.e. proving that a smooth, free and proper action of a Banach Lie group $G$ on a Banach manifold $M$ with embedded orbits ensures that the quotient $M/G$ inherits the structure of a Banach manifold, s.t. $M\rightarrow M/G$ becomes a $G$-principal bundle. I know this is briefly treated in Bourbaki's "Lie groups and Lie algebras". Unfortunately, in the proof they refer to the Bourbaki book "differentiable and analytic manifolds" which is not available to me. Could anyone please provide me with a reference?
