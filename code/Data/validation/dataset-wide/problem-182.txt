Laws develop over time based on major events. Where I would start is piecing together a timeline of rough events. The large events are ultimately what will create and shape public opinion regarding the laws. At some point, humanity is going to go to space on a much larger scale than present. Those individuals will feel loyal to their Earth nations and to their local communities and ideas they left behind on Earth. As more and more nations come to space, of course there will be a lot of different cultures and ideas brought to space. However, space travel is and always will be incredible expensive. So therefore, it's a safe assumption that the people who start out going to space come from wealthy nations or nations with sufficient wealth that make space travel a strong priority. Examples likely include America, Russia, China, Canada, Japan. Basically, look at what nations are already in space or planning space programs and imagine them all in a room together. Those are the interactions of early space exploration. For the early time, any space conflicts will base around these Earth nations. This is very similar to conflicts in the new world as it was being settled - all based around European nations. It will take a few, maybe even several, generations before people start to develop separate identities from Earth. This will happen as individuals are born in space. However, their parents will have an influence in shaping their lives, so they will retain many ideas of right and wrong from them. At some point there will be a separation event where those space civilizations decide to part ways with their Earth nation identities. Typically, this would be something morally opposed by those individuals, or something that creates excessive economic hardship. Some ideas may be an additional tax that is unpopular, a declaration of war which the space individuals don't see as agreeable, or the defunding of space programs, leaving the space civilizations to fend for themselves. You want to create this event as an emotionally significant event. People are driven by emotion. So the laws are going to be based on Earth-nation laws, with tweaking as that independent nation sees fit. Regarding your death penalty law, something of that nature is likely to have very strong opposition. Humans generally regard killing someone as wrong. In order to accepted, it would need to have: 

Apart from that, magmatter can also collapse into a blackhole if magatoms are oriented too close together, making strings, sheets, and hollow objects of magmatter the most practical structures. 

I imagine a creature engineered to metabolize and synthesize its own magmatter and reinforce its normal matter composition, having delicate electromagnet organs to hold and move around its magmatter components. This biological makeup of hybrid matter should be ideal for: - magnetically suspending a blackhole inside its body, - structurally supporting its other body parts against the effects of gravitation, and - creating armor for protecting against space debris Furthermore, it can have finely controlled mirrors, lenses, skeletal muscles, and photosynthetic cells supported with magmatter, surrounding the blackhole for it to either sustain the blackhole by feeding it with its own radiation or extract some of its energy to sustain other metabolic pathways. 

Organized synesthesia could be achieved by conscious correlations of sensory data, enhancing both pattern recognition and interpretation 

Noumenal Conveyance Noumenon is the opposite of phenomenon. It is a thing as itself, an object's fundamental existence as opposed to a thing as represented by other things. If somehow, other sensory perceptions, correlations, and interpretations, are heightened and integrated altogether as to build a comprehensive copy of reality within the mind, wouldn't that create noumena out of raw phenomena? Likewise, a multimedia communication system that involves recreating the noumena by exhibiting all their constituent phenomena should be possible as well. A thing-as-itself can be made communicable by integrating and exhibiting the thing-as-it-appears from different sensory perspectives 

To get away from idiots. What is holding people up from creating that perfect society? You know, the one where kids can walk to school unescorted and nobody has locks on their doors because it is inconceivable that anyone would open somebody else's door uninvited? Idiots. Antisocial jerks who just don't want to play along with your society. You can try to build your Utopia on Earth, but most of the good places are taken and filled up with idiots and jerks. Let's face it, most of the human population are idiots and jerks who need years of training and conditioning just to tie their own shoes, and all of that socialization still doesn't prevent them from taking your stuff if it isn't nailed down or chained to something really big. Having to nail your stuff down or chain it to large objects is super inconvenient. So if you want to make a society on Earth that doesn't suck, you have to do something about all of those idiots and jerks. The most common approaches, such as relocating them to some other place with a suitable habitat or turning them into fertilizer, have distinct drawbacks. That leaves relocating yourself and like-minded associates to some other place that is hard to get to. The "hard to get to" part is pretty important, as the idiots will definitely follow you if you're just going across the street. There might be other considerations when planning your colony, but the "better society" angle will be hard to overlook after the first colony is established. Consider: Transport to your colony will be difficult and expensive, and the number of slots for colonists will be limited, so when interviewing for those slots you will be focusing on getting only the best and brightest. In other words, the colony will be built from only the smartest and most capable individuals that humanity has to offer. Idiots need not apply. The society such people could build would be enviable, which is why the idiots would want to get there. To the idiot's way of thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to live in a place where nobody ever locked their bikes? I could steal bikes whenever I wanted to!" 

With these in mind, together with the assumption that the magnetic charge of a monopole is directly propotional to its mass, then theoretically, magnetic equivalents of nucleons and electrons (called magnuclei and magtrons respectively) can stably exist as magatoms. Magatoms, having large charges, will typically have larger masses and also greater internal attraction-repulsion forces, therefore making them extremely dense, but also extremely strong materials. A magatom may be imagined as a big north pole orbited by small south poles. 

The four topics I discussed are more tightly related than I may have discussed them, but the simple premise is that language, thought, and perception will merge into a single concept. If the answer is yes and a convention for mixed sensations will indeed provide people with the privilege to broadcast the entirety of themselves, what would become of such a society? But if no, and allowing ourselves to consciously develop mixed sensations and be able to communicate them more efficiently still cannot allow us to completely and truly understand one another, then what can? 

The key problem with building a backyard nuclear power plant is getting sufficient quantities of fissile material of sufficient purity to easily achieve criticality with a crude reactor design. Naturally occurring deposits of fissile materials burn themselves out fairly early in a planet's lifetime, so by the time 4+ billion years has passed, all that is left is the stuff that takes quite a bit of processing to burn, and it is safe to say that processing of natural ores in their current state into nuclear fuel is something that is well outside the capabilities of even the most industrious and precocious teen. But OP did not specify that this planet was Earth. If we assume his world is a geologically much younger planet (about 2 billion years old, give or take a few hundred million), then it is conceivable that naturally occurring deposits of fissionables are still lying about that can be purified by simple chemical processes that any child can accomplish. For example, she could crush the ores with a hammer or some other means, wash the crushed ore in acid to put the fissionables into solution, filter out the crud from her solution, and then raise the pH of the solution with lye to make the fissionables precipitate out. If she is starting with high enough grade ores to begin with, then this should be all that is needed to get nuclear fuel that can achieve criticality. Then our young atomic engineer needs an atomic pile, and that can just be a pile... as in a pile of dirt. Run some plumbing through the pile to extract heat to drive whatever heat engine she chooses, and some other plumbing through which she can maneuver moderators/neutron sinks to regulate the power output by pushing them through the pile to where her fuel is buried. She might also want to bury some thermocouples and maybe other detectors in near the fuel to get an idea what is going on while she is shuffling her makeshift control rods about. The resulting nuclear power plant would be crude, and the chances of prompt criticality accidents sterilizing the entire neighborhood would be ludicrously high, but this is a young planet, which means the inhabitants are colonists from someplace else as the only things which would have had a chance to evolve there yet would be things like algae and bacteria. This leaves open the possibility of a fairly low population density (very, VERY large backyards), and thus relatively limited concern over what the neighbor does on their side of the hedge. If your nearest neighbor is a few miles away and they are not downwind, then what do they care if you mess up and make a glowing crater behind your house? 

To me the most immediate answer is that of wealth disparity. Currently on the planet, we can group people into categories based on how they get around: Shoes - Bikes - Cars - Planes In the future, there would be a new category - Spaceships. People who use spaceships for transportation are the richest of the rich. Think of the difference between someone with a private plane, to someone who has a car. It costs a lot of money to acquire and operate a spaceship. The fuel costs are enormous to get on and off most planets, and servicing the various components requires incredible technical expertise. So as a result, only the richest of the rich can ever afford them. This creates an entirely new class of people, and they are very likely to view those with less as inferior to them, which creates exactly the type of system you desire. Space-born individuals may view the planet Earth and it's inhabitants in a similar way to how first-world people presently view the third-world. For the public office, it's simple. These are based on elections, and money has such a large role in the political process, nobody from the lower class has a chance. For marriage, there are a lot of forces at play. Firstly, space-born individuals have very limited contact with Earth-born individuals in which to develop any romantic interests. Secondly, Earth-born individuals are widely seen as less capable and a setback. And finally, space-born society has less people and is thus more closely knit, so the level of impact of the opinions of others is much greater. 

Organized Synesthesia is the biological version of multimedia arts. Within the brain, synesthesia occurs as an interpretation of sensory data from a sense organ that is somehow associated with a type of sensory data from a different sense organ. The idea of hearing smells and tasting emotions probably leads to disorganized thoughts, but enhances the synesthete's pattern recognition abilities. But by making the recognizable patterns available for correlation to consequently develop entirely new "meta-senses" arising from those correlations, maybe we can re-organize thoughts even better. The simplest example I could give would be a sensory ability made for sentient photosynthetic organisms, designed to find the optimal light settings to have enjoyable meals with maximum nutritional value. Simply put, a creature can taste the rainbow and the sunlight by having: 

Source Based on the image, I can deduce that strong lasers are concentrated into the target chamber, generating enough power to "rip spacetime". This results to the energy being dissipated as a stream of radiation and virtual particles transferring their momenta into the ship. That stream is magnetically directed towards the back part of the ship to create thrust. 

Next, we need something countable that progresses as time passes. In order to be an effective measure of time, it needs a few qualities. 

I immediately though of small islands in the ocean. The corporation could buy one or even build one. Depending on the exact situation, there may be the legal framework for that corporation to actually fully own the island. This seems to me to be the most cost-effective pathway. Another path may be to effectively buy the government of a small island nation. In fact this may or may not be limited to a small island, but any government willing to sell itself. There are likely quite a few sovereign nations sufficiently susceptible to such a purchase, given a large enough price offering. Yet another way could be exploration of a less charter region. For example, if a corporation establishes a research lab in Antarctica, at the bottom of the ocean, on the moon, or on Mars, that could eventually progress to where the corporation is effectively in charge of land and operating as a sovereign entity. Another suggestion is that the corporation may be able to outright buy some largely unused parcels of land up north in either Canada or Russia, or in the middle of the desert. Finally, lots of indigenous societies have treaties that effectively make them sovereigns over portions of land (reserves). They may sell some of these rights to corporations, given a high enough price. 

Simply put, this creature is engineered to be an interstellar steed, with enough reason to use insane amounts of power to sustain equally insane metabolic pathways. 

And here's a size comparison between a magmatter nanotube (the tiny blue line on the lower left) and a classical carbon nanotube. 

What can I say, other than such a race will possess the maddest parkour skills. If such extremely developed senses are accompanied by an extremely agile musculature, micro or high g's will have little effect on their physical performance. Not only will underwater sports become popular to them, but even aerial and orbital playground will have such strong appeal to their species they'll probably be better living offworld within bizarre artificial habitats, a la parkour heavens. Aside from being space ninjas, they'll also be highly sensitive to any stimulus across the senses in their body-map. Therefore, their surgery and tracking techniques will also be as awesome. If they're not gifted with innate full-organ or full-limb regeneration, an individual can perform transplants by itself. As a species, they'll quickly advance towards transhuman-equivalents since body modifications are the next generation of self-operated transplants. One downside I can say though, is that they'll have trouble meditating, or sleeping at that matter. Since they are sensitive to the minutest enviromental changes and its effects within their bodies, they'll probably require dampener drugs or hormones that will minimize their sensitivities whenever they need to relax. They'll be ninjas or surgeons or ninja-surgeons at best. At worst, they'll be paranoid addicts or sedentary monks. 

The refugees are going the wrong way. A high latitude ocean voyage on homemade balsa rafts or dugout canoes is suicide. You need real oceangoing vessels for that. There is a "right way" around the world and a "wrong way". Sailing west is relatively easy, and experienced sailors do this for recreation on modern ocean worthy sailboats all the time. Sailing east is definitely the wrong way, though, as you end up in the high latitudes to gain favorable currents and winds, but then you face frequent foul weather, which is a non-trivial problem if you don't have very capable boats. Disregarding the kinds of sea conditions your refugees will face in a higher latitude ocean crossing counts as "handwaving" in my opinion. We are not talking here about the refugees just getting splashed with a little spray on occasion, but rather about their makeshift boats being totally swamped by walls of water, being rolled completely over, and being flipped end over end, or just being smashed into splinters. Assuming the boat survives this kind of abuse (big assumption with a balsa raft), everyone and everything not tied down is gone. I am not kidding about that "tied down" part. Nobody will be able to just "hold on" while a medium-sized hill of cold water rolls across the boat, and that raises another point: Water in the high latitudes has a different, heavy quality from low latitude water. The water quite literally feels more dense when those waves hit you and your boat. A high latitude ocean passage without properly constructed vessels and skilled sailors is suicide. Even if you are going to gunkhole up the coast to Kamchatka and island hop across the Aleutians, waiting for fair weather for each leg, there are still places where you will have to make deep water passages, and it is almost never nice sailing weather in that area anyway. 

Language in the most primal sense of the word, is a convention for communication between separate entities. Humans have the most developed languages. We have dialects and jargons too many to count, but these aren't the only languages out there. Complete with grammar, syntax, morphology, orthography, and a lot more, programming languages can be considered convention for communication between humans and machines. We can tell our computer what to do, and it gives us feedback. Mathematics can be a language, too, considering its also just a convention of axioms and propositions. Maybe dolphins have their own grammar of echolocative squeaks. Ant colonies can have their own pheromone codewords. Satellites might be talking via radio frequency modulation. When we get right down to it, all languages are simply just social cues, regardless of what sensory medium is available for the task. 

For the locomotor skills you required, I'd say the human body plan is enough, albeit with slightly longer arms and three-jointed legs for quadrupedal motion, a prehensile tail for high-speed maneuvers, an opposable toe for each foot, and a highly flexible membrane connecting the forearms, hips, and forelegs for gliding and rolling. The creature would like a cross between a monkey, a flying squirrel, and a cat. Momo from Avatar:TLA would be the closest creature, minus the oversized ears.
