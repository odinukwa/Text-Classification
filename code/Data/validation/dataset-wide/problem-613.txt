You may run into some compatibility issues with this frame, and should be aware of potential issues, or sure of the correct size/standard, before you buy certain parts. Just knowing that it is a Peugeot isn't enough, as they were made over several decades on different continents with different standards in different places. The wheel size will be either 27" or 700c, probably 27" if it was made for the US. That means most modern road wheels (700c) will be a bit too small (8mm), so you would either have to have a "long reach" brake to reach the braking surface or make sure you have 27" wheels. The axle spacing (wheel width) might be a bit different too, which can usually be corrected with some fiddling with cone wrenches and washers, or just calling it good it if the difference is not more than a few mm's. As for the bottom bracket, a lot of peugeots have the less common "french thread" bottom bracket shell (there are a few different standards, "english" being the most common), meaning most new bottom brackets wouldn't fit. If you can spin the cranks and there is not a lot of resistance, and there is no noticeable play or rocking in the axle, then you probably don't need to worry about it (I would be sure to tighten down the bolts holding the crank arms on though, good practice). I would do some research about what size wheels and bottom bracket that bike has, which you can probably just find with the serial number under the bottom bracket. It looks like you really just need wheels! A back brake wouldn't hurt, also ... 

What you have is a basic 3-speed square taper crank arm built for an 8 speed chain. The important parts to consider when replacing it is the BB interface (square taper) and the chainring spacing (8 speed). If you don't want to upgrade the bottom bracket, then you will have to get another square taper crank arm. The chainring spacing is less strict, there are differences between 8, 9, and 10 speed crank arms in the chainring spacing. You can be off by a gear or two but the shifting will be a bit less than optimal. Here's some more discussion about it. Personally I have no problem using a 10 speed crankset with an 8 speed chain/cassette on my mountain bike, but I've also been riding it long enough to be sensitive/responsive to mis-shifts that might happen because of it. I consider it an upgrade, as the 10 speed crankset is quite a bit lighter and stiffer, but if you are prioritizing reliability over eeking a bit more efficiency out of the bike, I'd stick with an 8-speed crankset. FC-M3000 This is meant for 6/7/8 speed drivetrains and is square-taper, so it would be an exact replacement and you wouldn't have any issues or have to upgrade anything else, but it's not much of an upgrade. FC-M430 Alivio This is a square taper 3x9 crankset, so it would work even though it is not specifically 8-speed, and looks like a solid upgrade from the most basic model. FC-M610-L Deore This is a nice crankset. Also 2-piece BB and 10-speed spacing. I have one like it on my bike. It would work with a new BB but would be sub-optimal shifting with 8 speed. FC-MT500-3 is basically the same. You don't need to stick with Shimano either, something like the SRAM S600 would work also, as it is 8 speed and square taper. 

To clean the pads, use high-grit sandpaper (400 or so). The best way to clean the rotor is with alcohol and a clean rag or paper towel, as that will evaporate and not leave a residue. 

If you want to make your bar tape last longer, there are a couple approaches you can take: repair it when it is damaged, or invest in longer-lasting bar tape. Even though it seems like it might be harmless, I would not use improvised bar tape, or no bar tape, or some flat, non-absorbing tape like household electrical tape, as it is actually an important component for both comfort and safety. Along with the seat and the pedals, the handlebar is a primary contact point between you and your bike. All of the vibrations your bike feels are transmitted through these contact points. If you try riding a bike without bar tape, your arms will feel those vibrations much more than they would with something to absorb that shock, your arms will get tired much faster. At best it is uncomfortable to ride like this, and at worst it is dangerous, and can make it difficult to use your brakes properly. Cheap tape will fray, dry out, or fall apart sooner than nice bar tape. If it does start to fray or fall apart, or if you crash and damage part of it, you can wrap electrical tape around the damaged area to repair it. This will usually hold as long as you need it to. Personally I have started using synthetic leather bar tape (Brooks) as it is much more durable than the cheap stuff (2 years old, used almost daily, little sign of wear), and does a really good job at absorbing that vibration. It is heavier and thicker, though, so it's probably not what you'd want to put on a racing bike. 

You will probably be safe to ride it. Since it is the back wheel, you are not risking the front wheel seizing on something and getting thrown over the handlebars. If the back wheel seizes it would just skid/stop. I have seen wheels collapse catastrophically, but it has always been from impacting a curb or car or something directly at high speed. I imagine with five spokes broken the rim would be more susceptible to that sort of catastrophic failure on impact but I don't think you are risking that happening if you stick to smooth ground. There are people who ride bikes with 5 broken spokes and not even notice. So, it's by no means something you can jusy ignore long-term and I wouldn't go bombing down any hills like that, but if you try riding it and it works and stops, you shouldn't really have anything to worry about besides not rolling very efficiently and eventually (maybe quickly) breaking more spokes. 

It's a standard shimano/sram compatible cassette. It is the most common 9 speed cassette available. (assuming its 9 speed from specs listed here) The only real alternatives are "campagnolo" or "campy" cassettes, which are uncommon and expensive, or "freewheels" which are threaded cartridge type things, and not cassettes, and rarely come with so many speeds. The chain can be shimano, sram, kmc, etc, as long as it is the same number of speeds as the cassette. Technically the cassette compatibility is determined by what is called the freehub body, but the shimano/sram standard is virtually universal, with most brands at least. 

A lot of cyclists are concerned about safety and having the proper equipment, but I have never seen a cyclist riding in the city with a full-face helmet, nor have I seen a full-face helmet marketed for city/road riding. Is there a reason for this? I have a friend who broke several teeth after a tire got caught in some trolly tracks resulting in many thousands of $'s of dental bills, and know of another young woman who died in a similar incident after hitting her head on the curb. Both were wearing standard bike helmets. If the full-face helmet offers more protection to more of your head, why wouldn't some people want that, even if they're not doing some ridiculous jump on a downhill or BMX bike? 

Higher quality pedals often have a key for a hex wrench on the inside of the pedal spindle, ether 6mm or 8mm. It is faster to change them out using a hex wrench than rotating the pedal wrench all the way around that many times. You will have to use the short end of the wrench to break the tension in the threads, then use the long end for a quick extraction. When reinstalling the pedals, use the long end to put it in (low torque), being careful not to cross thread, then tighten it down with the short end (high torque). vs
