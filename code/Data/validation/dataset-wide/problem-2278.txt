A rain jacket is a good windbreaker as well. The main downside, as you pointed out, is that it will not breathe as well as other fabrics. This shouldn't be an issue as long as you aren't doing a lot of high-output activities (ex: climbing, hiking uphill with a heavy pack for hours). Regular hiking and the likes should be fine. 

I'm interested in both the binary case (e.g., is this boot still waterproof or not?) and the more analog case (e.g., this softshell will keep you dry in a rain storm for about X hours). 

Short answer: For your first rope, none of these numbers matter. Any 60m dynamic rope around 10mm diameter will be fine. Get the cheapest one of the three, and buy a rope bag to keep it clean. Get some good instruction and enjoy climbing outside! 

For the most part, it comes down to certifications. Each organization will give you a particular certificate for completing their courses. These will be recognized by different places differently (e.g., if you are studying for a guide exam). Overall though, the knowledge you gain is the most important part of the course. I wouldn't worry about the particular organization as long as they offer a good (recognized) program at a reasonable price. Most places have a similar structure of courses (WFA: wilderness first air, WFR: first responder, WEMT: wilderness EMT) with increasing commitment and more depth on each topic. 

I think the regulations are so strict because the park service wants to keep a level of discipline about how hikers manage their food, so that none is accidentally left in a pack, and the oils and crumbs from food don't contaminate a pack. This avoids scenarios where food was left in a pack unintentionally. Bears don't hunt humans except in rare cases (except for polar bears). It's not an issue of a bear attacking you personally. Rather, some bears WILL linger around campsites and wait for opportunities to steal food. Its more that the rules are in place to ensure that a bear doesn't come into a persons camp because the person accidentally left food somewhere it shouldn't have been. 

First off - whether one is more durable or not, they're somewhat different products. Whether you need one or the other is more based on what you're doing than on "durability". Hardshell vs Softshell note - these are marketing terms in the US outdoor industry. Apparently they're not standard internationally. Hard shell jackets offer a high level of windproofing, and low breathability. They're also usually the most waterproof. They're made with heavy nylon / canvas materials. Think a heavy gortex rain jacket. The hardshell material itself offers great protection against wind and rain, but not much insulation. Because they're windproof, they usually don't breath as much as softshells. Softshells are more like polar fleece jackets, perhaps with a cloth cover- they're very warm, because the material traps a lot of air. They also tend to retain their warmth when wet. Some softshells may have a goretex treatment, and be somewhat waterproof. But they're generally not very windproof. What they're for Hardshells are necessary for harsh environments with strong winds. You may also have a "softshell" jacket underneath the "hardshell" outer layer for insulation. Durability Durability in outdoor gear is a odd issue. My experience is that a lot of gear on the market now is designed to be ultra lightweight, often at the expense of durability. Jackets, backpacks, even the expensive ones just get torn up sometimes. You can find products with more rugged construction, but they come at a weight penalty. I could see how a serious mountaineer (which high end jackets are theoretically designed for) may prefer a light outer layer that will just get replaced after each expedition. 

Short roping is an advanced technique, but it is a necessary one to progress quickly and safely in the mountains. As with most techniques, knowing when to apply it just as important (or more) as the technique itself. The safety in short-roping comes from three main ingredients: 

Most likely, you'll be traveling with knots in the rope. Your best luck for a haul system is a Canadian drop loop (6:1) system. This provides enough mechanical advantage for a single rescuer to pull a victim out. I'll add some references that you should use in addition to professional advice: 

This, probably more than any issue in climbing, has generated more discussion, heated debates, and vitriol (especially on the internet) than any other issue in climbing. Both sides (lower vs. rappel) are equally ardent in their belief that their way is the One True Way. Unfortunately, both sides are wrong. My rule is simple: Climber's choice. You should choose the method you prefer and believe is safer, and you should do it the same way each time to minimize the chance of a serious climber error. (You should still know both ways.) If you are the last climber going up and will clean a route, it's important to tell your belayer what you intend before you leave the ground. This way, both parties have a clear idea of what will happen. This can be helpful if communication is hard from the top, and decreases the chance of a miscommunication. When you get to the top, your command to your belayer should be clear and completely unambiguous: 

Sorry for not giving a single recommendation, as in many situations in climbing, there are multiple options, and its important to know what the tradeoffs are. Carabiner As per usual, you want to make sure your carabiner is loaded along its spine. That is, longways. So, one end of the carabiner will be running through the leg loop or belay loop, and the other end will have both strands of the autoblock coord. What I do I place my autoblock on my main belay loop, then extend my belay device with a PAS. The rope runs down between my legs, and I can use either hand to control my descent. My autoblock is made out of coord that I measured and cut specifically to be too short to catch up in my extended belay device. 

I've always just used tape marketed towards climbers (including Metolius brand tape) and reused the gloves, applying more tape as needed (although I have friends who make new gloves every time). Gloves last me almost a whole season in this fashion, so I don't worry about price too much. Other athletic tapes don't always work as well, for some reason, but there may be exceptions. $4 isn't totally unreasonable, IMHO 

In addition to zoul's excellent answer, the Bowline has another drawback in that it can come loose (or even undone) after repeated load/unload cycles (i.e. weighing and unweighing the rope). This means that the bowline is not as good as the figure-8 to use to tie-in a climber, especially for multi-pitch climbing, gym climbing, etc... (That said, many good climbers do use the bowline to tie in.) 

Will Gadd's book Ice & Mixed Climbing states that if you mess up the first attempt at a V-thread, start over in clean ice. This includes if your screw holes intersect only partway down the hole, the two holes didn't intersect, or the distance between the holes isn't large enough. Practicing making V-threads on the ground is much better than trying to figure it out on rappel when it's cold, dark, and everyone is soaked. A good rule of thumb for all anchors (but especially rappel anchors) is to make the best anchor possible with what you have available. Fortunately, on most ice climbs starting over means moving over a foot or two to solid ice. In some cases, building a "textbook" anchor may not be possible. If you have to use an anchor that is less than optimal, make a backup anchor and clip the rope to this backup in case your V-thread fails. You want the backup to be relatively taught but all of the weight should be on the primary V-thread (just a little bit loose). The last person will remove the backup when they rappel. This Petzl video shows a good example of this (at 4 minutes). 

You're framing this as a question of "how much will this hurt my climbing"? I wonder if you could use this down time from actual climbing as a chance to focus more on pure climbing specific strength training, and possibly come out of the whole process a stronger climber. Something I tend to do is all but quit route climbing in the winter, and take it up again in the Spring. In that "down time", I'll still boulder once a week, and incorporate some climbing specific strength training. I lose a lot of endurance, but gain some strength, and usually come back in the Spring as a slightly stronger climber. If you keep your strength up, endurance will come back in a month or so. If you already have rock rings and a pullup bar, have you thought about doing the official rock ring training plan: $URL$ ? Metolius published a 10 minute workout plan that includes finger strength, pullups, lockoffs, leg raises, all climbing specific stuff. It all done from a hanging position, so it shouldn't tax your lower body, and it would build a lot of climbing specific strength. And since you're planning on not climbing as much anyway, you could try and hit it a couple times a still have several rest days (at least for your upper body). You might actually come back stronger after the marathon, and be able to train endurance on routes on top of a better base of strength. I feel like something like this (10 minutes of pure upper body strength training a couple times a week on rock rings), plus one gym climbing session a week, would integrate with your marathon training. But you'll have to listen to your body as you go. 

These shoes are pretty far gone. At the very least you'll need a new toe rand in addition to the resole, which is going to cost you a significant portion of the price of a new shoe. Your shoes may even be too far gone for any repair at all. Treat this as an opportunity: it's unlikely your first pair of shoes fit exactly right. Now, you know much more about what you liked and disliked about your shoes. Take this chance to try on a lot of new models, and pick out a shoe that you like even more. Next time, get your shoes resoled before they show signs of wear on the rand. Here are some images showing the signs of needing a rand repair. Resoling shoes is great, but rand repair is costly and lowers the lifetime of your shoes. I generally get 3-5 resoles out of my shoes before retiring them. 

Disclaimer - I should mention that my answer only applies in the context of the original question. I'm discussing my experience rappeling in a rock climbing context, using a dynamic single or half rope, a "stich-plate" or tubular belay device, and an autoblock backup (not a prussik). I can't speak to rappeling in caving (where the gear would be different) or in rescue situations (where you'd be rappeling with the weight of 2 or more people) Actually, rappelling down a wet rope is about the same. Its just that everything else in climbing becomes more dangerous when its raining. :) I live on the east coast of the US, and we get rain pretty frequently. There's about a 30% chance of scattered thunderstorms nearly every day, and rain is just a fact of life. I get rained off a route maybe once a year. While I can't say I enjoy it, actually rappelling down a known rappel route in the rain isn't all that bad, especially if you can stay tied into a rope system the whole time (i.e, you don't have to scramble unroped along a ledge to get to a rappel anchor). The rope dynamics don't seem to change all that significantly. I always rappel with a regular tubular belay device and an auto-block backup, and I usually rappel with the device in "high friction" mode. (note - I also use a 9.8mm or thicker rope) I would think that the rope would get slipper-ier, but it seems like the ropes get thicker and heavier when they're wet, so maybe that counteracts it some (my rope is supposedly "dry treated", but gets fatter anyway). What is more dangerous 

Forecasts for the mountains generally seem to be somewhere between useless and unreliable. Afternoon thunderstorms, clouds that come out of nowhere, unexpected rain showers, etc... Anyone who has spent some time in the hills has a story or three of getting caught by unexpected weather, and we're always taught to be vigilant and prepared. Do mountains really make their own weather? Why is that? 

Build a snow anchor, then transfer the load to your anchor. Holding your partner's weight for the entire duration of a self rescue would be a bad idea. Building an anchor is independent of what your partner is doing. Always build an anchor. On glaciers, you'll most likely build a deadman anchor with an ice axe. It's possible to do a deadman with a ski, but it's time consuming and probably impossible to do alone while holding your partner. Crevasse rescue with a team of two just adds to the complexity. At a minimum, you'll need to be able to arrest the fall, build an anchor, transfer the load, check on your partner, build a haul system, and effect the rescue. Oh, and you'll be by yourself.
