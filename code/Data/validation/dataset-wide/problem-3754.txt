If you ask is it true that a tropical nodal curve can be presented such a way as a limit of nodal curves then the answer is no. What is true: Curves in a family which tropicalises to tropical curve of genus g has genus at least g. So, tropical nonsingular curve may be presented as a limit of nonsingular curves and a tropical limit of singular curves is singular too. 

For a $\mathbb C P^2$ is known a result: if through the generic points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ with multiplicities $m_1,m_2\dots, m_n$ correspondingly a degree $d$ curve passes then $d^2\geq m_1^2+m_2^2+\dots+m_n^2-min (m_i)$. (see Lemma 1 in "Curves in $\mathbb P^2$ and symplectic packings" Geng Xu) The idea of the proof is the following: move slightly a point $p_i$ and apply Bezout theorem. Can we do the same in $\mathbb CP^3$ ? For a generic set of points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ with prescribed multiplicities $m_1,m_2\dots m_n$ we are looking for a minimal degree $d$ hypersurface through them. Suppose it is $d$. Then slightly move $p_i$ in different directions and find two surfaces of degree $d$ through new collections of points. Then apply Bezout theorem of these three hypersurfaces and get $d^3\geq m_1^3+m_2^3\dots +m^2_n- min(m_i)^2$. The only problem is that these surfaces may intesect by a curve and we can not apply Bezout Theorem. Can we repair this? 

Added: another function like that is $S_p f(z) = f(z)+\frac{f(\sqrt{zp})^2}{f(p)}$ in a field of characteristic two. We discovered the following operator which acts on the space of polynomials (or series) of the type $\sum a_{ij}x^iy^j$ where $a_{ij}$ belong to a field $k$ of characteristic two. For a point $p\in (k^*)^2$ and $f$ as above, we define $$S_p f(z) = f(z) + \sqrt{f(z^2/p)f(p)}.$$ Here we multiply and divide points coordinatewise, i.e. $z^2=(z_1,z_2)^2=(z_1^2,z_2^2)$. Note that $\mathrm{char}(k) = 2$ facilitates taking the square root, so $S_p f$ is again a polynomial (series). The properties are as follows: $S_pS_pf=S_pf$ and $(S_pf)(p)=0$. We can take several points $p_1,p_2,\dots\in (k^*)^2$ and look on the dynamic generated by $S_{p_i}$. The question is as follows: have you seen something like that? Could you advise anything on studying of this dynamic? In a sense $S_p$ changes the curve $f(z_1,z_2)=0$ to a curve $(S_pf)(z_1,z_2)=0$ which passes through $p$. So the limit of applications of $S_{p_i}$ will be a curve which passes through all $p_i$. Motivation: this operator appeared as a detropicalization of a certain operator in sandpiles. See $URL$ for details about the problem. The idea is that in the limit, sandpile pictures become tropical curves. And adding a grain to a point corresponds in the limit to the following operator $G_p$ -- we take the face of the tropical curve where $p$ belongs and contract this face until this new tropical curve passes through $p$. Trying to interpret $G_p$ algebraically we ended up with the above operator $S_p$. We can not reproduce the same behavior for other characteristics of the field. 

No, this is in general quite far from being true (and also somewhat ill-posed, since there is not a natural candidate for what "=" means since there is no map). For example, take $M = S^1$ and $N=S^2$, both with the antipodal $C_2$-action (which you can view as either right or left action). Then $M/C_2 \simeq S^1$ so $H_*(M/C_2 \times N;k) \cong H_*(S^1 \times S^2;k)$ as graded groups. But $C_2$ acts as $-1$ on $H_2(N)$ and trivially on $H_*(M)$ so $H_*(M \times_{C_2} N;{\mathbb Q}) \cong H_*(M \times N;{\mathbb Q})_{C_2} \cong H_*(M;{\mathbb Q}) \cong H_*(S^1;{\mathbb Q})$ as graded abelian groups, where $C_2$ on the outside denotes coinvariants. 

Note that a group like $GL_n(\mathbb F_p)$ of course would be in $\mathcal L_3$. Whether it is in $\mathcal L_1$ depends a bit on which $\mathbf G$ you are willing to start with. Now, you may want to limit the class in $\mathcal L_2$ in some way to ensure that it is not larger than $\mathcal L_3$ and avoid the "pathologies". I would be surprised if there was a good way to do this, without referring back to $\mathcal L_3$: The main problem, I think, it that there is no really good "purely group theoretic" way of e.g., specifying that you only allow extensions "on top" by diagonal automorphisms (not field or graph), without getting back into the Lie theory. This is at least what goes wrong in the $SO_{2n}^+(\mathbb F_q)$, $q$ even, case. (Derek also hinted at this.) You may also, conversely, argue that $\mathcal L_2$ is anyway too small, since it is not closed under iteratively putting things "on top" and "on the bottom"; to be "almost" of Lie type should be a bigger class... The cleanest fix for this is to go all the way and study the groups which are virtually a finite group of Lie type, i.e., has a finite index subgroup which a finite group of Lie type. Now, this class of groups is however of course just the class of virtually trivial groups, aka all finite groups... This is not as silly as it sounds, since many deep open problems in finite group theory, such as Alperin's conjecture and its cousins, stem from the philosophy that all finite groups behave almost like finite groups of Lie type.... 

Has it been proved or disproved that for any fixed $a\geq 1$ there are infinitelly many primes $p_n\equiv a\pmod{n}$? I believe i have proved that for every $a\geq1$ there are infinitelly many natural numbers $m$ with $m\equiv a\pmod{\pi(m)}$ where $\pi(m)$ is the prime counting function and i was wondering if this can be also true for a smallest subset of $\mathbb{N}$ (the primes). OEIS does not tell much.$URL$ Any reference would be appreciated. Thank you for viewing. 

In Mathematics everyone believed that Hilbert's second problem had an affirmative answer but it was (later) shown that this is not entirely true and I suppose that the consistency of arithmetic has now been "disappeared" 

Some days ago, I noticed that $3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 11 +1=34^2$. I am almost sure that if we denote four consecutive primes by $p, q, r, s$ then the equation 

(As it was asked) here is the proof: We will see that if a proper choise of maximum number of elements not exceeding $n$ with the mentioned property exists,then we can construct another (equivalent) set of elements containing only prime powers. Suppose that the maximum number of elements we can choose from $\{2,...,n\}$ with the mentioned property is $r\geq \pi(n)+1$. It is impossible to have all elements prime powers because by the pigeonhole principle there will be 2 elements $p^a,p^b$ with $a<b$ and $p^a|p^b$ which means that the desired property does not hold for $p^a$. So,there must be at least one element that can be written as $x=k\cdot m$ with $\gcd (k,m)=1$. If $k$ does not divide the product of the rest elements and so does $m$, then we can pull out $x$ from the set and place $k$ and $m$ into the set ,having a new set with $r+1$ elements with property (A) holding true. (of course no other of the elements is equal to $k$ or $m$ because this would again lead to a contradiction) But this is a contradiction since $r$ is the maximum number of elements as we assumed. So,without loss of generality we may assume that $k$ does not divide the product of the rest,but $m$ does. This means that we can replace $x$ with $k$ in the set with property A) holding true. We repeat the argument again until $k$ "drops" to a prime power. ( which lets us arrive at a contradiction for prime powers as we already mentioned at the beggining) (By the way this is not Erdos's proof but one i found some years ago.But i am almost sure Erdos proved this theorem) So, your set must have at most $\pi(n)$ elements. On the other hand, if your set contains at least $\pi(n)+1$ elements it could contain 2 powers of the same prime,$p,p^m$ and so the gcd you want would be at least $x=p$ (or $x=p^m$). I think it would be more difficult to determine the asymptotic size of $S$ depending on $k$ but certainly $|S|\leq\pi(n)$ holds for a random set $S$ as you require. 

Centralizers of various types of subgroups, and their relationship to invariants like the cohomology of the classifying space $BG$ has a long history of study, at least going back to the papers from the 50s by Borel and others. EDIT: Changed what's below to a more limited statement. I don't know a reference to your exact question, but the following more limited statement is true: Theorem: A compact connected Lie group G has the property (**) "For every elementary abelian $p$-subgroup $H \leq G$, $C_G(H)$ is connected" if and only if $G$ has torsion-free fundamental group and has a finite cover isomorphic to a product of copies of $SU(n)$, $Sp(n)$, $S^1$ for various $n \geq 1$. In particular, if you in addition assume $G$ to be simply connected, the only examples are products of $SU(n)$ and $Sp(n)$ for various $n$. Sketch of proof: 1) The condition is necessary: If (**) holds holds for all elementary abelian p-subgroups $H$ for all p, then every elementary abelian p-subgroup has to be contained in a maximal torus. By a result of Borel this implies that the fundamental group is torsion free. One easily checks case-by-case that the exceptional groups and Spin(n), $n \geq 6$ cannot be involved in $G$ since they have non-toral elementary abelian p-subgroup (which remain so even after modding out by a central subgroup). This leaves the cases above. 2) The condition is sufficient: We just have to check that the centralizer of an element of finite order of a group as above will again be a group of the same form, which I think you can do by hand. -- Further info: The groups in the list above are exactly the ones whose classifying spaces have integral cohomology rings a finitely generated polynomial algebra. In fact any polynomial ring which occur as the cohomology ring of the space has to be of this form --- this is the so-called Steenrod problem, whose solution is described in Andersen-Grodal: The Steenrod problem of realizing polynomial cohomology rings. J. Topology 1 (2008), 747-760. (DOI: 10.1112/jtopol/jtn021). Also, see Andersen-Grodal-Møller-Viruel The classification of p-compact groups for p odd. Annals of Math. 167 (2008), 95--210, in particular section 10+12 for a summary of the relationship between subgroups of $G$, their centralizers, and cohomology. Our setup is more general in that paper (we study p-compact groups), but it contains references to the papers of Borel etc. 

Are there infinitely many positive integers with the property: If $n$ is a sum of two $k$th powers then it is also the sum of two $k-1$th powers, the sum of two $k-2$th powers, ... , the sum of two squares? For example let $n=2^5+1^5=31$. It is the sum of two 5th powers but not the sum of two squares. I am not sure if this has been studied before. Here we suppose that $k\ge 3$. EDIT: I will give an example mentioned in a comment by Aaron Meyerowitz: Since $2^{25}$ is a sum of two 24th powers it is required that it is a sum of two 23rd powers, of two 22nd powers etc. We may be able to find a number $n$ which is of the form $n=a^2+b^2=c^3+d^3=x^4+y^4$ and this seems ok. But it is possible that also $n=k^{12}+l^{12}$ for some $k,l>0$, so we must check if this number is also the sum of two 11th powers, two 10th powers etc.If not, it does not "pass the test". 

Let $N=\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}$. We sum all the elements of every nonempty subset of $N$. Which sum(s) appears most often? (Let's call this sum a champion). Using a simple pigeonhole argument a champion must appear at least $\frac{2^n-1}{T_n}$ times. ($T_n$ denotes the $n$-th triangular number). It seems that the champion should be somewhere around $T_n/2$ but I cannot prove it. Am I missing something obvious here? 

Let $k$ be sufficiently large .Denote the sequence $n,a_1,...a_{k-1}$ with $a_i\leq i+1$ where $i\leq k-1$. The sum of the first $k$ elements including $n$ (denote it by $S_+(a_k)$) must be always a multiple of $k$ . So let $d$ be a positive integer with $S_+(a_k)=d\cdot k=n+a_1+...+a_{k-1}\leq n+2+...+k=n-1+k\frac{k+1}{2}$ . So $d=\frac{S_+(a_k)}{k}=\frac{n-1}{k}+\frac{k +1}{2}<k$ for $k$ large enough. We will see that the period we want is the number $d$. We will show that the next element $a_k$ is the number $d$ and inductively we wil reach our goal. Let $a_k$ be the next element ,so we must have $k+1|S_+(a_{k+1})$ meaning that $k+1|d\cdot k+a_k$ which gives $k+1|a_k-d$. But $a_k\leq {k+1}$ and $d<k$ so we have only the case $a_k-d=0$ and so, $a_k=d$ (Repeat the argument again) So we only wait until $\frac{n-1}{k}+\frac{k+1}{2}<k$ to find the period $d$. This gives the bound closely to $\sqrt n$ which Lucia commented. I hope this helps. 

Let us consider polynomial contact structures on $\mathbb RP^3$, i.e. contact structures on $\mathbb R^3$ defined by a form $w=Pdx+Qdy+Rdz,\ P,Q,R\in \mathbb R[x,y,z]\ $ in an affine part and then extended to $\mathbb RP^3$, and $ w \wedge dw \ne 0$ everywhere. One can find all such forms $w$ that $deg P, deg Q, deg R \leq 1$ by direct calculation: $w=(qy-rz+a)dx+ (pz-qx+b)dy + (rx-py+c)dz,\ a,b,c,p,q,r\in \mathbb R;$ $ap+br+cq \ne 0$. But I can't do anything for greater degrees. Do you know any criteria for coefficients of $P,Q,R$? Does anybody know any contact polynomial form with $deg P, deg Q, deg R \geq 2$? Added: What is the form (I mean form coefficients in $\mathbb R^3\subset \mathbb RP^3$) defining the polynomial contact structure constructed by plurisubharmonic function $f=x^4+y^4+z^4+t^4$? Answer: $f=x^4+y^4+z^4+t^4$ is not strictly plurisubharmonic (see on the plane $x=y=0$ on subspace generated by $dx,dy$). So it does not produce a contact structure. 

Consider an convex plane figure $F$. How to prove that there is an affine transformation $a$ such that $\sqrt{3}$ diameter$(a(F))^2\leq 4$ area$(a(F))$? I found only one reference, to "Über einige Affininvarianten konvexer Bereiche", but unfortunately it is in German. Added: formula (12) there looks like desirable. After I found a solution myself, I can understand German. The proof there in the pages 734 (corresponding to considering $D'$ below) and 735 (considering $D''$). The author estimated $f/d_u^2$, $f$ is an area (Flacheninhalt) and $d_u$ is a diameter(Durchmesser). So, emergency over, thank you)) the proof is rewritten by me in $URL$ 

We consider a discretization of the Laplace operator on $\mathbb Z^2$, $URL$ Then, it is natural to consider its fundamental solution $u$, i.e. $|u(x)|\leq C \ln|x|,\Delta u = 1$ at $(0,0)$ and $\Delta u=0$ elsewhere. I am sure that somewhere it is proven that the discrete derivatives of $u$ behave exactly as we expect them : $|u'(x)|\leq \frac{1}{|x|}, |u''(x)|\leq c\frac{1}{|x|^2}$. But I can not find anything like that in the Internet. Could you provide me with a reference, please? Any information anout $c$? 

I know that there are no solutions to $2^n\equiv 1\pmod{n}$ for $n>1$ and I can prove that there are infinitely many $n$ such that $2^{n+1}\equiv1\pmod{n}$. My question is: 

Suppose we start with $k$ primes $p_1,p_2,\ldots ,p_k$ (not necessarily consecutive) and a residue class for each prime $r_1,r_2,\ldots ,r_k$. We denote the least integer not covered by the arithmetic progressions $r_i+m\cdot p_i$ as $r_{k+1}$ which is going to be the new residue class for a (random) prime $p_{k+1}$. We proceed in this way "covering" the natural numbers (without changing the $r_i$'s.) Question:Is it true that $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{r_n}=+\infty$? Motivation: This would directly imply Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions if we make use of this Lemma: Let $a_n$ be a sequence of natural numbers, strictly increasing with $\gcd(a_i,a_j)=1$. Then if $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{a_n}=+\infty$ then the sequence contains infinitely many prime numbers. I tried to modify some proofs which show the divergence of $\sum\frac{1}{p}$ but without much success. Thank you very much in advance! EDIT: The primes are distinct and the residue classes are not reduced modulo $p$.Suppose we start with the primes $2,3,7$ and their residue classes are $(1)_2 , (2)_3 , (4)_7$ which means $r_1=1$, $r_2=2$ and $r_3=4$. The least number not covered by the progressions $1+2k , 2+3k , 4+7k$ is $6$.We define then $r_4=6$ and $6$ is going to be a new residue class for a new prime (random choice) let's say $p_4=17$.Then $r_5=10$ and we choose a new prime (Let's say $p_5=5$) and continue in this direction. The $r_i$'s could be much greater than the $p_i$'s 

Let $p$ be a prime number and $P=\{1,2,...,p-1\}$ In how many ways we can sum all the elements of $P$ in such a way that we will reach a multiple of $p$ only when we sum the last summand? For example let $p=7$ . Clearly, $1+2+3+4+5+6$ is such a sum (In fact there exist $408$ such sums) but $2+3+5+4+1+6$ is not, because already $2+3+5+4=2\cdot7$. We can see after a little investigation that if the total number of sums is $f(p)$,then $\frac{(p-1)!}{p-2}\leq f(p)\leq (p-1)!$ (equality holds iff $p=3$) Is it possible to improve this (to find asymptotic bounds or -even better- something precise)? Thanks in advance! EDIT : It is possible to prove in an elementary way that for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\phi(n)\mid f(n)$ ($\phi(n)$ is Euler's function)
