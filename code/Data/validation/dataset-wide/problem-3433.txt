I have heard that people often handle uncertainty using point estimates not probability distributions. However, I have been unable to find any evidence for this in the heuristics and biases literature. I was wondering if anyone could point me to some relevant papers? To clarify, there is no question whether some people have some beliefs about the higher moments of distributions. However, it would not shock to me to learn that when (for example) considering by how much the stock market will rise tomorrow, people form a point estimate (perhaps using historic averages) but do really not think about the uncertainty surrounding their estimate. 

$\lambda _t = \lambda _{t+1}f'(k_{t+1})$ Plug that in and you have it! The equation on which so much pointless macroeconomics built. 

In answer to your first question (can you get the Euler equation without a Lagrangean?), the answer is 'yes'. At least, there are less formal ways of deriving it. In general, assuming that a consumer chooses to consume strictly positive quantities of two perfectly divisible goods $x$ and $y$, then it must be that: $MUx/MUy = p_x/p_y$ (If this were not true, then the consumer could increase their utility by shifting spending a little more on one good and a little less on the other.) The so-called 'Euler equation' is nothing more than an application of this result, viewing the 'goods' and $C_t$ and $C_{t+1}$. If you delay your consumption by one period, you put your cash in the bank for one period, earning real interest at rate $r$. Hence, if we normalise $P_t = 1$, then effectively $P_{t+1}=1/(1+r_{t+1})$. In other words, consumption tomorrow is cheaper than consumption today (assuming $r_{t+1} > 0$) since delaying your consumption allows you to earn some interest. Finally, we assume that utility is constant, time-separable and exponentially discounted (as in your set-up). Thus we need to remember to put a $\beta$ before $MU_{t+1}$. To summarise, we 're-interpret' the variables in the tangency condition as follows: $MU_x = u'(c_t)$ $MU_y = \beta u'(c_{t+1})$ $P_t = 1$ $P_{t+1}=1/(1+r_{t+1})$ Finally, observe that if firms maximise profits taking the cost of capital $r_{t+1}$ as given with total depreciation (as you assume), they hire capital until $f'(k_{t+1})=1+r_{t+1}$. Plugging in yields the Euler equation. In answer to your second question (how can you derive it with a Lagrangean?), I would recommend that you try the following steps: 

The idea is that since agents are ex-ante identical, they should have the same (ex-ante) expected utility. Ex-ante identical means that even the agent does not know what's his type until resolution of type at date-1. Because they have the same preferences each agent's consumption profile must be identical. And the analysis can then focus on symmetric equilibrium. What symmetric means, as explained in the footnote, is that the consumption profile must be identical. The consumption profile $(C_1, C_2)$ represents the consumption for the agent at date 1 (if he is type-1) $C_1$ and the consumption for the agent at date 2 (if he is type-2) $C_2$. Otherwise stated $(C_1, C_2)$ does not depend on the type and each agent has the same $C_1$ and $C_2$. Since the types coincide with the date it's a little bit trivial but it really says nothing more than that. For the constraint, there is a mass-1 continuum of agents, each endowed with one unit of wealth, so the total wealth is 1. Then from that total wealth an amount $I$ will be invested in the productive technology whose return is $R$ per unit invested. Then it follows that : 

This does not work like that. If you want to add-up all the debt in the world you will not end-up with 0. Think about a situation in which I owe you \$100, you owe someone else \$100, and this someone else owe me \$100. Total debt would be \$300, even if another guy is debt-free. Moreover, country debt (called sovereign debt) is not only owned by other countries but most of the world-debt, is owned by people, mostly through pension funds (and other investments). So even in a single-country economy, the country may issue some debt that consumers or firms can invest in. And the global amount of sovereign debt will be strictly positive. Again most of the world-debt is privately owned and it may even be the case that those five countries you're talking about don't hold a single debt contract. 

You are certainly right that Kahneman and Tversky neglect the importance of levels in their model (even though they do acknowledge the importance of levels informally, as in the quote you reference). However, this situation has now been rectified by Kosegi and Rabin, who include both 'levels' utility (i.e.'consumption utility') and 'gain/loss' utility (they also generalise Prospect Theory to handle many goods, and endogenise the reference point). As I understand it, the point of the Anna/Ben story is that marginal utility is a decreasing function of wealth. I would think that this is adequately captured by Kosegi and Rabin, assuming that we specify that levels utility is a strictly concave function of consumption, as is standard. Of course, a different route would be to allow the curvature of the Prospect Theory value function to depend on wealth (as you propose). However, I'm not sure what this would buy us above and beyond the Kosegi and Rabin approach. Moreover, the theory would still be missing the rather obvious fact that people do care about absolute levels of wealth, at least to some extent. 

I think that you are more or less than correct in thinking that cash that is never spent (nor expected to be) may as well not exist. Thought experiment: suppose that, unbeknownst to you and everyone else, £1 million suddenly appears under your mattress. If you never discover the money, it is hard to see how it could change anything in a meaningful way. There are some caveats, however. First, a game theoretic point: even if rich people never spend their money, threats to spend their money might influence outcomes. For example, they could pledge to donate lots of money to the political opposition unless the government does what they say. If this threat works, they will never need to pay out. Second, a ‘non-economic’ point: money gives you options, and people might enjoy having options in itself (even if they don’t spend the money). One might object to the kind of ‘options inequality’ brought about by an unequal wealth distribution even if rich people never spend their cash. Third, to bring us back to the real world, we should stress that, usually, rich people do consume more than poorer people. So while it might be interesting to discuss wealth inequality without consumption inequality, this is not a phenomenon which we are actually facing today. 

The first order condition of the maximization problem is \begin{equation} f'(x)-s=0\iff f'(x)=s \end{equation} We can then replace $x$ by $x(s)$ because this is the optimal value given $s$. Since this is true for every $s$, we can differentiate with respect to $s$ which yields \begin{equation} f''(x(s))x'(s)=1 \end{equation} Which can be rewrite as \begin{equation} f''(x(s))=\frac{1}{x'(s)} \end{equation} Then $x'(s)$ can be estimated by finite differences which would give $f''(x)$. 

I think you are missing the credit risk attached to any loan. You, as an individual borrower, are far more likely not to reimburse your loan than a bank. Thus the loan is far less risky. Central bank money could only be qualified as "better" (even that does not mean much) because it is issued by the Central bank, deposits are issued by commercial bank, so you bear the risk that your bank fail, but it happens that in most country individual deposits are insured by some state agency. So I cannot really see why central bank money would be better than deposits. Nowadays, the amount of reserves that a bank must hold does not actually play a big role in the economy (as opposed to what most of economic textbooks and economic professors are teaching in undergrad schools). The most important part is the interest rate that is paid on those reserve, which is fixed by the central bank and which act as an opportunity cost for the bank when it decides to lend to an individual rather than holding reserves. However I see your point, but the fact is that this way of thinking is misleading. Banks create (in theory) as many loans as they want, because there are no physical constraints, if you want, that prevent them to do so. The only constraint is a regulatory constraint that states that in order to remain solvent (in order to be able to repay the depositors) banks should invest x% of the assets in reserves. Those reserves would be held on a central bank account in central bank money, and the return on those reserves will be the fed fund rate decided by the central bank (the same way a commercial bank decide how much interest it will pay on your savings account). So it is true that one more unit of reserves gives the right to issue more than one unit of loans but this does not mean that one money is better or worse than another. It's is just a matter of regulation. It may be hard to get, but the point is really that central bank money is safer so cheaper than deposits, no matter what regulatory constraints apply to banks. You may want to read this paper which may be a bit complicated but you should get the intuition. This two docs may be simpler (with nice pictures) : doc 1, doc 2. 

In a recent paper, Edelman et al. examine (amongst other things) how discrimination on AirBnB varies with the characteristics of hosts. First, they conduct a field experiment which involves sending a large number of fictitious applications, some of which are associated with African-American names and some of which are not. Then, they regress whether an applicant is accepted on the guest race, a host characteristic and the interaction. For example, they regress acceptance on guest race, host race and the interaction of the two. The idea is that if African-American hosts (for instance) are less likely to discriminate, then the coefficient on the interaction term should be non-zero since the effect of receiving an application from an African-American should depend on whether the host is African-American. So far, so good. However, given that host characteristics are not randomly assigned, we should control for them. Otherwise, we might find that African-Americans are less likely to discriminate even though the real explanation is that they tend to offer expensive properties, and people who offer expensive properties are less likely to discriminate (made up example to illustrate the point). They seem aware of this, since they throw in various host and location characteristics as controls. But wouldn't it have been better to use the interactions of these covariates with applicant ethnicity as the controls? After all, we want to control for the fact that people with certain characteristics might respond to African-American applicants differently, and this means controlling for interaction effects.
