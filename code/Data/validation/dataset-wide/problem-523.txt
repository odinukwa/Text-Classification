YOU SHOULD HAVE CHECKED BEFORE BUYING THE WHEELS! 10-speed Dura-Ace is not compatible with other cassettes. You can install a 8 speed cassette on other Shimano 10-speed compatible hubs. Edit: Reading the question again, of course you can keep the 10 speed cassette. Just replace the shifters, rear derailleur and chain with 10-speed ones and be prepared to replace front derailleur and crank if there are any problems. 

Get better brake pads. In my experience, Kool Stop Salmon lasts far longer than anything else, and wears the rim very little. The Jagwire pads that I have had for more than a year seem to be doing good, too. Original pads from Tektro, ProMax etc are useless and Shimano is not very good either. The point about using both brakes is good, too. 

It's because you have a combination of brake levers designed for V-brakes and side pull brakes. V-brakes need more cable pull for the same effect, so your levers pull the cable too fast. The solution is to get levers designed for caliper brakes, something like for example this (note "Caliper or Canti Brake Lever System"): $URL$ There are also adapters for cable pull issues, but they are made to solve the problem other way round and cost as much as simple brake levers. 

The thicknesses of 8 and 9 speed Shimano cogs differ by 0.02mm ($URL$ I would say that the same chainwheel is compatible with 8 and 9 speed chains. 

40-559 is the number to match. For tubes, the ETRTO number is a range of fitting tire sizes. For complete explanation, see $URL$ EDIT: This answer originally hinted that 37-590 would be correct. It isn't, 559 is the rim diameter and it must match. 

The most direct route between Bormio and Annecy goes through Switzerland, which has a network of national bike routes which consists mostly of well maintained side roads. One option is to cross the border to St. Moritz, take a combination of these routes to Geneve and ride to Annecy from there (take the shortcut route over Mt. Saléve instead of flatter one). I rode the route 4 some years ago and I strongly recommend it. There is a Swiss cycle route map that shows a list of recommended climbs and shortcuts, which is great for changing the route on the fly. One caveat is that Switzerland is an expensive country and staying on Italian side of the border might save significant money. Border crossings inside Schengen area are more or less a non-issue. 

It looks like a Helicomatic. Once you know the name, there is plenty of information on the Internet. 

To the last question, a far better order of doing things would have been to disconnect the shifting cable first. The knurled part at the end of cable rotates on the threaded piece at the end of the chain, visible through the hole in the wheel nut. Rotate it to disconnect the cable. 

First, because in your position it takes effort to pedal standing up instead of sitting, and that effort is better spent in moving the bike forward. Maintaining one's weight at back takes more effort than the usual standing pedaling position. Second, because there is no need to reach the ground with both feet while riding. When stopped, it is easy to get out of saddle, tilt the bike enough to reach the ground or just reach the ground with one's toes. Most people have moving joints in their necks and can turn their heads so that they can see. 

The part is called centering sleeve. The easiest way to install it is leaving it to the place where it is shown on the screen shot, then pushing it down with a headset spacer as far as it will go and finally installing the dust cap and pushing with it. It is not supposed support any load, even if it accidentally did with the old fork. Instead, the bearings are adjusted with the headset cap and held in place by clamping the stem around steerer tube. 

From $URL$ it looks like it could have been made form 1957 to 1961 or later. It looks like it has a 3 speed internal hub gearbox, probably a Sturmy Archer, as it is British made. Appears that Armstrong was part of a larger group by this stage, and the ealier design approach may have changed a lot. If you look under where the pedals are (the bottom bracket), there is often a serial number which may contain the year of manufacturer. Or it could be stamped elsewhere on the frame. 

You will see sealed cartridge bearings in many bottom brackets, which use roller bearings. Also common in head sets. Ball bearings were more widley used up to around 10 years ago. But still common in pedals and hubs. 

Racing is all about speed. 25mm tyres have a larger contact area so there is more rolling resistance than a 23mm. It doesn't make a huge difference but it is significant. You wouldn't be competitive on 25s with everyone else runnings 23s. But for some very tough terrain, such as going over cobblestones, most teams will often run 25s front and back. They also deflate slightly from the maximum pressure to avoid some of the ride harshness. I started on 28mm tyres on a commuter and soon went down to 23mm. Didn't notice any difference in tyre wear or comfort. Bike was less effort to ride. Only downside is is that it is more likely to catch a rut in the road, but you ride with a bit more caution. 

Hard to be definitive. But I thought it started with Gary Fisher and others on cruiser bikes with coaster brakes $URL$ the Repack Races. He went on to develop the first mountain bikes. 

It called a track stand. It originates in track racing on a velodrome, where in the opening stages of the individual sprint event you sometimes need to come to an almost complete halt. Tricky and dangerous to do if not well practiced, it can end in a 'sprawl of shame' if your technique is not perfect. 

I use a Garmin Forerunner 235 which has these features. The heart rate monitor is built into the back of the watch, rather than using a chest strap which I think the Polar model does. It can also connect to bike speed/cadence sensors, your smart phone etc. A dedicated bike computer like the Garmin Edge 810 is also useful as it adds a map display and route planning. 

Surly is more known for touring and off road bikes, but they do have a cromoly road bike or just hte frame $URL$ There are still plenty of custom frame builders around. Zinn Cycles is in Colarado, so maybe close to you? $URL$ 

I guess there are no dropper posts with shorter total length available? Seems like there is a need for one, especially with dual suspension bikes that have shorter seat tubes. You could drill out the top lug and thread of the bottle holder. Much easier to access this way then filing from inside. But you would be left with a slightly larger hole in your seat tube. 

Yes, at least one strand has broken. Looks like this happened where the cable was previously under the fastening bolt. Since then, the cable has been let out, maybe to allow for new brake pads? It would probably last a while before more strands break. But a new cable is only around $5. It's very important to be able to stop your bike reliably, so I would definitely replace it now. It's an easy change to make, cables ends normally slot in fairly easily to the brake levers on V-brakes. 

Bicycles do have dynamo powered lights, which are pedal powered. They used to have a small generator that was rotated by the tyre. But this has been replaced by 'dynanmo hubs', with the generator being attached to the wheel hub. This basically means getting a wheel buildt around the hub or buying a wheel which has this type of hub, which would be fairly expensive. The one dynamo can power both front and back lights. Rear lights don't need to put out as much power as front ones. The batteries should last for several months of normal use in blink or flashing mode. For the front lights you may want to look at a better quality one that has several brightness settings. But you wont get much more than 6 hours burn time from them. Keeping a spare set of charged up batteries can help. 

The source of the whooshing sound is contact between tires and road. The sound is present with all road bikes, but much quieter with aluminum rims and tires with thick sidewalls. What makes carbon wheels loud is that they resonate like acoustic instrument's sound box at the tire noise frequency range and the larger surface is more efficient at transmitting the sound. You can hear the resonant frequencies if you just tap the wheel with your finger nail, a carbon wheel will have a lower pitched and much louder sound. 

With Campagnolo, yes. From 9 to 11 speeds, cable pull is the same. Of course, this is assuming that you have a Campagnolo shifter. If you don't know the brand, you are out of luck. 

I have found that the one from Competitive Cyclist is pretty good: $URL$ It takes into account the lengths of your legs and arms, so prepare for some measuring. Also, if you have no idea what you are looking for, do not buy blind but try the bikes in person. 

Finnish: Polkupyörä ("treading wheel") or pyörä ("wheel") for short. To disambiguate, and to endless confusion to non-hobbyists, the jargon term for wheel is kiekko ("disc"). Disc wheels are of course known as plate wheels or plate discs. 

If you want to improve braking on the bike and don't require complete authenticity, there are aftermarket levers with modern pivot placement. 

Yes, chain falling off the pulley is expected. When you backpedal, the chain is moving from rear cog to pulley and you are moving the pulley away from the incoming chain. Don't do that. The pulley is by the way really worn, replacing it might improve things. It should work, but you need to be very precise with the shifter. 

Are those non hook edged steel rims? They can't keep high pressure tires on. Get some hook edge rims or accept low pressures. 

The normal freewheel thread is too large for cogs smaller than 16T. One source for the information is Sheldon Brown's singlespeed page. It is a good one to read before buying any more parts. A BMX flip flop hub will, however, take smaller freewheels that have smaller thread. Fixed/free flip flop hubs have the larger freewheel thread and similar sized thread with lock ring thread on the other side, these do not work with small freewheels. 

No, it is not a good upgrade. The fork change could save some weight, up to about 400 grams. This is less than difference between full and empty bottle. The ride quality may or may not change depending on your current fork and the replacement. If you can't look up the specs of your bike, you can always measure yourself, the critical measurements are steerer tube diameter, steerer tube length (new forks come with extra and you are supposed to cut them, just don't get too short one) and distance from fork crown to axle. 

Yes, this is how saddles work. If you find yourself sitting on the rear edge of the saddle and sliding forward, you probably need a seatpost with more offset. You might also be interested in SDG I-beam design. It has been around for more than 10 years and while not unpopular enough to be out of production, it also hasn't replaced the traditional rails design. 

Cranks and chainrings are made of aluminium, which does not rust. You'll probably be fine with cleaning them and new cassette and chain. This isn't that expensive any more. From quick googling, your bike uses 7-speed cassette, which are still available. Upgrading to modern parts would require replacing all transmission components, shifters, derailleurs and the rear wheel. This will be expensive and probably not worth the trouble.
