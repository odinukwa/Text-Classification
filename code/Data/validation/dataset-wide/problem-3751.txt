If you end up attempting to label the same vertex with both labels/colors, then the graph is not bipartite. Otherwise, you end up with every vertex labeled with the parity ($0$=even, $1$=odd) of their distance from the initial vertex chosen for this labeling. 

If the unclear question means "how many ways can you partition the 20x20 unit region into multiple subregions each of which is a rectangle integer unit dimensions, with widths and lengths greater than zero?" then you've got a different answer. There is $1$ way to partition it into $400$ different 1x1 squares. There is $1$ way to partition in into $1$ large 20x20 square. There are $0$ ways to partition it using $399$ {1x1} squares, because using $399$ {1x1} squares leaves a {1x1} area to be filled, which can only be filled by a {1x1} square yielding $400$ {1x1} squares, which is already counted above. Using $398$ {1x1} squares, there are $20\times 19 \times 2 = 760$ ways to partition it: with $398$ 1x1 squares and $1$ 2x1 rectangle. The 2x1 rectangle can be posed vertically at $20$ different $x$-positions by $19$ different $y$ positions, or it can be posed horizontally at $19$ different $x$-positions by $20$ different $y$ positions, yielding $20 \cdot 19 \cdot 2$. You can do similar combinatorics for using $397$ unit squares = $397$ {1x1} + $1$ {3x1}. Placing the long rectangle vertically yields $20 \ times 18$ ways, horizontally also yields $18 \times 20$ ways, totalling $720$ ways. It gets more fun at $396$ unit squares, because the four squares you've removed from the first part of the solution above can be drawn as just $1$ {2x2} square, or as $2$ {1x2} squares (both of which can take on vertical or horizontal orientations), or as $1$ {4x1} square drawn either vertically or horizontally. The total number of these combinations can be calculated in a similar manner. And keep going on up to using $0$ (zero) {1x1} squares: the single $1$ {20x20} square fitting in the area. 

I must admit that I hesitated answering this question, but here it is. The answer is "no". Assume there exist topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that $C(X,Y)\simeq \mathbb{R}$ and $Y\not\simeq\mathbb{R}$. Identifying $C(X,Y)$ with $\mathbb{R}$ and $Y$ with the constant functions in $Y^X$ we consider $Y$ as a closed subsapce of $\mathbb{R}$. Considering the surjection $\mathbb{R} \to C(X,Y)\to C(\{x\},Y) \to Y$, we see that $Y$ is connected. Thus $Y\subset\mathbb{R}$ is a closed convex subset. As $Y\not\simeq \mathbb{R}$ there must exist an extreme point $y\in Y$. Note that $C(X,Y)$ is a convex subset of $C(X,\mathbb{R})$ and the constant function $y$ is an extreme point of it. It follows that $C(X,Y)-\{y\}$ is also convex, hence contractible. But $C(X,Y)-\{y\}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ minus a point. This is a contradiction. 

Conway's Game of Life in 2-dimensions, as my exemplar instance in the class of (what used to be my overly general answer of...) Automata: deterministic finite state machines and nondeterministic and probabilistic automata and the theory behind them leading to things like acceptors of regular languages and the concepts of simulation, computational equivalence and computability as in Turing machines and "Turing equivalent", and the concept of "power of computing", computational complexity and complexity classes, bisimulation (and the equivalent computing power of single-tape vs. multi-tape and other classes of Turing machines, and the equivalent computing power of systems which can simulate other systems). 

Joseph, I believe that there is not a simple linear smooth mapping. My short explanation for it is that the morph from $S_0$ to $S_1$ does not really consist of a single continuous deformation, but instead of the concatenation of a sequence of multiple piece-wise linear deformations consisting of more than three separate steps: $S_0 \to S_a \to S_b \to S_c... \to S_1$ Your $S_0$ is the frame of an octahedron. 

Added in proof: After writing this answer and before posting I noticed that Nate Elderge already answered the OP. I decided to post my answer anyway, as it contains a "particulr easy example", as requested in the OP. So, here it is: Your argument is right. It is closely related to the Eberlin-Smulian theorem. Note that by Banach-Steinhaus every weakly converges sequence is actually bounded, so a function which is weakly sequentially continuous is exactly (a function which is weakly sequentially continuous on any ball, hence) a function which is weakly continuous on any ball. Thus, your question translates to "can one find a function which is weekly continuous on every ball but not weekly continuous". Here is an example: $$ \ell^2\to \mathbb{R},\quad (a_n)_{n=1}^\infty \mapsto -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \min\{n-\sum_{k=1}^n |a_k|^2,0\}. $$ Note that on every ball this sum is finite, hence the restricted function is continuous. However this function is not globally continuous, as one can observes using the unbounded converging net constructed in another MSE answer of Nate Elderge. 

Quick thought: make a four-sided pyramid of ice, square base of edge length $x$ and have the height be less than $x$. This type of ice-cube or pyramidal ice-berg has the majority of its buoyancy at the square face, thus the subset of size $1$ of {flat square base} is more likely to be the "face up" face in a container. This could probably be tested better with a plastic homogeneous pyramid rather than with an ice-cube pyramid which would melt during the experiment and change the results over time. There's probably a decent ratio $a$ such that if the height of the pyramid is less than $ax$ that the pyramidal-square base is significantly biased to be the "face up" floating face. 

Assume $\alpha:X\to X$ is not totally minimal. Then there exists $k$ such that $\alpha^k:X \to X$ is not minimal. Consider the quotient space $X/\alpha^k$ endowed with the quotient topology and let $Y$ be the corresponding $T_0$ quotient, that is, the space obtained by identifying points not separated by the topology. The non-minimality of $\alpha^k$ is equivalent to $Y$ not being a singleton. $Y$ is acted upon by the finite group $\mathbb{Z}/(k)$ generated by the image of $\alpha$. If $\alpha$ was minimal on $X$ to begin with, then the $\mathbb{Z}/(k)$ action on $Y$ is minimal, thus transitive, and it follows that $Y$ is a finite discrete set of points. Thus the natural map $X\to Y$ gives a non-trivial discrete quotient of $X$, thus $X$ is not connected. 

Electronic Journal of Combinatorics might be a good candidate considering the topic. My contention is that if the paper has a real result which is mathematical and combinatoric in nature, and is well-written, then the education-level of the author(s) should not play a role in whether the paper is appropriate or not for a particular journal. Whether or not one or more of the authors is an undergraduate still working on their studies or already holds a Ph.D. or teaching position should not be a factor. However, the best person to tell you about the most appropriate forum in which to attempt to publish your findings is your mentor, the professor sponsoring or advising you as you do this research. It is your advisor's job to advise about something like this, and they will have the best and most appropriate answer for you. People who don't know the details of your work, as the rest of these readers/commentators on Mathoverflow and slashdot are, cannot give you an informed answer. You should look closer to home, and ask your teachers and your undergraduate advisors, or an appropriate mathematician in your local mathematics department. 

Let $G=\text{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^n)$, $\Gamma<G$ be a lattice and endow $X=G/\Gamma$ with its $G$-invariant probability measure. For a point $x\in X$ let $G_x$ be its stabilizer in $G$ (which is a lattice conjugated to $\Gamma$), let $\Lambda_x\subset \partial \mathbb{H}^n$ be the limit set of $G_x$ and let $C_x$ by the convex hull of $\Lambda_x$ in $\mathbb{H}^n$. Clearly the maps $x\mapsto G_x,\Lambda_x,C_x$ are all $G$-equivariant. Fix a base point $o\in\mathbb{H}^n$ and for every $p\in\mathbb{H}^n$ set $$ f(p)=\int_X \left( d(p,C_x)-d(o,C_x)\right)dx. $$ Note that the integrand is bounded by $d(p,o)$ thus the integral is defined. For every $p$, $$ f(gp)=\int_X \left( d(gp,C_x)-d(o,C_x)\right)dx= \int_X \left( d(p,C_{g^{-1}x})-d(g^{-1}o,C_{g^{-1}x})\right)dx= \int_X \left( d(p,C_x)-d(g^{-1}o,C_x)\right)dx. $$ Specializing for $p=o$, $$ f(go)=\int_X \left( d(o,C_x)-d(g^{-1}o,C_x)\right)dx, $$ and we get $f(gp)-f(go)=f(p)$. Setting $\phi(g)=f(go)$ and subtituting $p=ho$ we get $$\phi(gh)=f(gho)=f(ho)+f(go)=\phi(g)+\phi(h),$$ thus $\phi:G\to \mathbb{R}$ is a homomorphism. Since $G$ has no non-trivial homomorphism to $\mathbb{R}$, we conclude that for every $g\in G$, $\phi(g)=0$. Equivalently, for every $p\in \mathbb{H}^n$, $f(p)=0$. Since for every $x\in X$, $p\mapsto d(p,C_x)-d(o,C_x)$ is a convex function on $\mathbb{H}^n$ we conclude that for every $x$, $d(p,C_x)-d(o,C_x)$ is constant. Substituting $p=o$ we get that this constant is $0$. Taking $p\in C_x$ we get that $o\in C_x$ and conclude that for every $p$, $p\in C_x$. That is $C_x=\mathbb{H}^n$. It follows that $\Lambda_x=\partial\mathbb{H}^n$. Applying to the point $x$ with $G_x=\Gamma$ we get that the limit set of $\Gamma$ is $\partial\mathbb{H}^n$. 

This question is equivalent to asking if a finite-state-automaton can decide or accept a particular language, or if a push-down automaton could. I believe the only way to deduce the self-intersection or self-avoiding nature of a walk based on relative moves of {turn left, move forward, turn right} is to turn them into a sequence of absolute moves and simulate them on the square lattice, keeping track of state along the way. Summary: Convert the sequence of relative moves into a sequence of absolute moves. This step is not absolutely necessary but helps to make the next step easier to understand. for any sequence of $n$ absolute moves $m_1 m_2 ...m_n,$ with $m_i \in$ {N,S,E,W}, it self-intersects if it contains a subsequence $m_a m_{a+1}...m_b$, such that $1 \le a\lt b \le n$ such that the subsequence contains exactly the same number of $N$ as it does of $S$ and exactly the same number of $E$ as $W$. This is equivalent to and can be restated as $N^cE^dS^cW^d$, or as saying $\Delta$(Longitude)$=0$ and $\Delta$(Latitude)$=0$. Deciding a regular language $x^n y^n$ (or in this case $N^c S^c E^d W^d$ ) can not be decided by a FSA (finite state automaton) but can be decided by a push-down automaton, which keeps track of state in the push-down stack. My reference for computability or acceptability by a Finite State Automaton is (for me, in this case) Papadimitriou and Lewis Elements of the Theory of Computation, which I remember from my undergraduate course in computation theory. I don't remember the original source described in the book, though. In this case, the push-down stack is keeping track of the state of either the number of N,S,E,W, via the direction traveled or the state of which squares have been visited thus far. Either way is equivalent, and effectively requires simulating the walk.
