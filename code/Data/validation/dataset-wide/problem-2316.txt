I like this article on vapor barriers. Your trash bag will act as a very good vapor barrier on the parts of your body that it covers. You are going to need a really large garbage bag, or a hole cut in the bottom, in order to cover your torso. Garbage bags, even the heavy duty ones, are not that durable, so you may need to bring one for every night. It sounds like your plan is to put a cotton liner inside your vapor barrier. I This is pretty close to the worst thing you can do. The vapor barrier, if working correctly, will trap about 0.5 liters of perspiration every night. In the ideal world you would achieve 100% relative humidity within the vapor barrier and everywhere the cotton liner is, which I think will reduce a lot of the chilling effect of the cotton, but more likely there are going to be gaps in your vapor barrier and the cotton is going to be a bad idea. Soaking a cotton liner in 0.5 liters of water is going to lead to a chilly night. You would be much better off putting the cotton liner on the outside of the vapor barrier. In that case, if the vapor barrier is working, the cotton liner will stay dry, but of course you will be sleeping in the clammy hell of a vapor barrier liner (but you will be warm). 

The need for your ears to pop results from a pressure differential between the middle ear and the atmosphere. The middle ear is technically outside your body (e.g., the bones in the middle ear and both sides of the ear drum are covered in skin) because it is connected to the outside via the eustachian tube. The eustachian tube is usually closed so the pressure in the middle ear doesn't respond to changes in atmospheric pressure (e.g., due to changes in elevation or altitude). When the eustachian tube opens (for example when you clear your sinuses or chew) the pressure equalizes rapidly and you feel your ears pop. If the external ear canal is perfectly plugged and then the atmospheric pressure changes there will be a small pocket of air with a different pressure than the middle ear once the eustachian tube open and equalizes the middle ear pressure with the atmospheric pressure. This pressure differential/force between the external ear and middle ear could cause pain and a feeling of fullness like your ears still need to pop. The exact impact will depend on the volume of your middle ear, the volume of the ear trapped behind the plug, and the pressure difference. When an audiologist performs tympanography, they create an artificial increase in the pressure in the external ear. This is a sizable 10-20 Pa change in pressure, but still less than going from sea level to the top of Everest. The changes in elevation/altitude/pressure encountered while hiking/climbing are small compared to the pressure differences encountered in an unpressurized aircraft (aircraft can climb at well over 1000 ft per minute where as Alex Honnold and Dan Osman can only climb at 100 ft per minute), so if ear plugs are safe in unpressurized airplanes, they should be safe for climbing. The FAA recommends ear plugs while flying. The military uses foam ear plugs (and sometimes ear plugs and muffs) in unpressurized air craft. The ear plugs do not form an air tight seal so therefore the outside pressure changes should not be a problem. If you experience discomfort like you ear not being able to pop, you can simply remove and then reinsert the plug. If you are really concerned, or have experienced problems in the past (e.g., while flying), some companies sell plugs designed for flying (there may be other manufactures also and I have no experience with this product or relationship with the manufacturer). 

There are a handful of manufacturers that make climbing holds from granite. My recollection is that Petrogrips used to make 30 cm x 30 cm panels of granite with various features cut into them. I cannot find them online, but this website sells some real granite holds by Petrogrips. There is also Nature Climbing which makes holds out of granite. You can also make your own homemade holds: $URL$ 

Finding quality 1/4" hangers has been problematic for a long time. There was a thread on the topic on Super Topo back in 2009. The best solution back then were the Moses hangers (Moses actually posted in the linked Super Topo thread). I cannot find the Moses Enterprises web page so they might be out of business, but it appears you can still get the hangers online (e.g., from Mountain Tools and possibly others). They cost about twice as much as typical bolt hangers, but in my opinion are better than rivet hangers if you are planning on leaving them behind. 

Quantifying the total risk of an activity is hard and to an extent opinion based. The increased risk of being solo, is more quantifable and that is what my answer focuses on. The major increase in risk of doing a via ferrata alone (as opposed to in a group or with a partner) is that if you get injured (e.g., from a fall, rock fall, or a bee sting), you will be alone. This is not that different from any other outdoor activity in remote, or semi-remote, areas. In general, there are more chances to become injured on a via ferrata than say walking on flat well maintained trails but less than more difficult "class 5" rock climbing. Being alone on a via ferrata, similar to walking, does not dramatically increase your chance of being initially injured. This is unlike, for example, class 5 rock climbing where rope soloing is more dangerous than climbing in roped pairs due to the technical limitations of self belay. There are some safety advantages of having a partner to double check your system in a via ferrata and for unknown routes (or unknown weather) for providing a sanity check. 

In a survival situation without water you will die in days and without food you will die in weeks. So in general, there is no need to eat in a survival situation. That said, the quick burst of energy you can gain from eating a surgery snack could make all the difference (e.g., a sharknado). There is probably little harm eating a little after one day without water. Your body will still have enough "water" to be able to digest food. Your body will also be in the process of conserving water so the amount of water lost in your stool will be limited. If you manage to live for 4 days without water, you probably should avoid eating as your body may not have enough water to digest the food. Again, a sugary snack might still be helpful in a sharknado. What is the harm in eating The chemical reactions for breaking down carbohydrate and fat are different. Hydrolysis is the process by which the chemical bonds in the carbohydrate are broken with the addition of water. The water is "destroyed" in hydrolysis. Dehydration synthesis (a type of condensation reaction is used to breakdown fat. This process "creates" water. This means that in extreme situations, ignoring sharknados and the such, you want to be using fat for energy. Since our body does not store much carbohydrate, in survival situations your body will rely on fat (and to a limited extent on protein). If you are going to eat and you have a bag of sugar and a stick of butter, go with the butter. 

There can be a slight weight savings for a double bag over two single bags. This is difficult to fully calculate, especially if one person sleeps warmer than the other or if there is a height difference (e.g., one person needs a long bag and the other a short bag). There can also be a comfort advantage, but it really depends on how narrow the double bag is. I have a wide single bag for car camping which probably qualifies as the "spooner's only fit" in your link which is no where near as comfortable as mated single bags, but definitely the lightest option. My real dislike of mated single bags are the middle zippers and separate foot boxes. For long hikes there are a couple of serious disadvantages. First, a double bag means you must camp together every night. It also means you need to stay in closer contact on the trail as one person is not carrying, what is in my opinion, the proper emergency gear. Further, if the bag gets wet, there is no backup (and probably a lot of blame). I would also be worried about drying the bag out in town since getting a double bag in a dryer might be problematic. There is also the issue of weight/volume distribution. 

Taking a literal definition of US and not restricting the answer to the continental US, there is a mangrove swap on Heeia in HI and the list of reptiles in HI does not include crocodiles or alligators. There are also 9 mangrove areas in Puerto Rico and the list of reptiles in PR does not include alligators or crocodiles (although I found some conflicting news reports). 

In the US you cannot refill the small tank at a propane distributor, at least not in any state that I am aware of. In general, the small tanks are classed as not refillable. There is small risk of fire and explosion refilling the tank on your own. If you chose to do it be careful and keep the refilled tanks outsidea in well ventilated area away from flames and heat sources. Partially refilling a small tank is quite easy. There are lots of how to videos on the web. With the proper adaptor, you can connect the small tank to a 20lb tank. These adaptors are readily available at propan shops, the Web and some big stores like Walmart. You simply connect the tanks and open the valve of the big tank. You will be able to hear the gas stops flowing. It is unlikely you will get it to be 100% full, but you can do a pretty good job. Once it stops, close the valve and disconnect the tanks. 

My wife and I would like to take my 7 year old son kayaking this summer. Was thinking about a circumnavigation of Lake Tahoe. It looks like there are plenty of put ins and take outs. I am curious how rough are the waters and how difficult are the landings/launches? Is there anything else unique to paddling on Lake Tahoe that we need to be aware of? 

More or less, yes with two caveats. If someone else is in the process of attempting a rescue (e.g., their first rope toss came up short or the boat is on the way) you might be better off making sure you do not end up under the ice (and potentially conserving energy). The second caveat is you need to reevaluate which way to go. The general idea of going back the way you came from is that you know the ice quality there. If you have crossed a long expanse of ice and are near the "far" shore, you might be better off going forward instead of backwards. 

One issue with a long traverse is that if the second falls, they may be unable to easily get back on the route. This means that there is an increased likelihood that you will need to escape the belay. It is infinitely easier to escape the belay when you are belaying directly off the anchor. This means I would go with something like anchor 1. One issue with all the anchors is that they look designed for a downward force, yet on a traverse, the force is horizontal. If there is another pitch, especially if there is a roof/overhang, the anchor also needs to handle an upwards force. 

I think the key is to avoid the gunk in the first place, or more accurately the second place. I like the these tape gloves and the advice at the end. That advice is you can shave the back of your hands. The tape gunk comes off bare skin much easier than when it is matted into the hair on your hands. The second, and more important advice, is to reuse your gloves. The second time you use them the tape it is much less sticky and you end up with less gunk. 

I don't think of myself as being a paranoid individual, but I am cautious about people I meet when hiking. For example, if I am eating lunch at a site less than a mile from an infrequently used trail head and someone shows up with inappropriate gear (for example no pack and wearing jeans) and attempts to start off a conversation by asking me where I am headed and how long I have been out, I get cautious and might even pack up early. I understand that it is likely this person is just being friendly while out on a day hike that does not require appropriate gear, but I have no idea how often this person is in fact up to no good. Similiarly, on the Appalachian Trail if I get to a shelter near the road that I was planning on camping at and it looks like someone is living there, I might decide to keep hiking. This may be completely irrational since I cannot recall ever hearing of anyone being assaulted or robbed on a hiking trail or at a campsite. To keep the question somewhat focused, how often are crimes like robbery and assault (I am not concerned with all crimes like vagarency, public intoxication, or drug use/possession), committed/reported on the Appalachian Trail? 

There is more to winter in New England than mountains and harsh weather. The Bay Circuit Trail, Midstate Trail can be done in portions or a few days. The Cape Cod National Seashore in the winter would not offer typical beach weather, but you could easily spend a week exploring the beaches, trails, and area. The Cape cod Rail to Trail project, and others, offer a nice way to see other parts of Cape Cod. 

Sleeping bags come in a variety of sizes (e.g., $URL$ The most common being regular and long (sometimes there is a short and sometimes there is a women's regular and long). The typical regular fits people up to 6' tall and a long fits people up to 6' 6". Of course there is some variability across bag designs and people's preference. As you are just under 6' tall, you might fit in a regular bag, but you might be more comfortable in a long bag. Typically you want the shortest bag that you are comfortable since that will be the warmest. The general guideline on liner size is to buy a liner that matches the size of your sleeping bag.
