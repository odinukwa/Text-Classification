If you think about it, your core is in the center of your body. It needs to be strong to support the weight of your entire body, including your back and neck. Adding core strengthening to your exercise routine can help protect your back and neck. By boosting your core strength, you'll also be less likely to rely on other back pain treatments, such as medications. It's important to incorporate exercises that work all of your abdominal muscles equally. Core exercises should involve the major muscles in your abdomen, including your internal and external obliques and the transverse abdominals. 

To obtain accurate results it's vital to control as many variables as possible during the baseline and all subsequent scans. An easy set of conditions to replicate is having all scans done first thing in the morning without eating or drinking anything. 

Yes, with proper form it's one of the few exercises that provide both "aerobic capacity development" and offers a "strength training effect". These findings have also been backed by the American College of Sports Medicine. 

Position: Side-lying Shoulder: (GH Joint) 0 degree's of Flexion. Elbow: Fully Extended. Movement: Shoulder Flexion from 0 to 90 degrees (gravity minimized) 

You're not increasing the number of Type I Fibers with endurance training. Essentially your body becomes more efficient in various ways i.e (increasing the number of mitochondria, increasing O2 delivery to muscle, delaying lactic acid onset etc) Muscle Fiber Types Skeletal muscle fibers can be classified into three types: 

What is it? Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is an overuse injury the tendons that originate at the outside of the elbow. Tendons are like ropes which connect the ends of muscles to bone. The tendons affected in tennis elbow attach the muscles of the forearm to the humerus (upper arm bone). 

Day #2: Ab crunch machine I would 100% ditch. Any compound functional movement will hit your abs. Aside from hitting your innercore (as a dynamic warm-up) stay far away from isolation ab training. You’re hitting anterior delts twice (shoulder presses and front raises). I’d add in some kind of D2 Flexion / Extension (Diagonal shoulder movements) using a med ball w/ lunges or battle ropes (X pattern). 

If there were a “magic way” to increase breast size naturally considering the popularity of elective painful surgery – this would NOT remain a secret. I don’t even know what it is but I’m going to guess it’s an unregulated herbal supplement. Supplements are NOT reviewed by the FDA or any third party before you open take them - they frequently don’t contain the ingredients that are listed – or they’re simply labeled as a “proprietary blends”. 

UPDATE #2 The 3-5 min just provides more recovery time so you're moving more weight per rep and avoiding muscular endurance training (nothing too earth shattering) - glycogen obviously is replenished to a greater degree the longer you rest. The study below talks about the same range for power. No study would be complete if it did end by contradicting itself -- 30-60 sec is best if according to the last paragraph. I guess it's too idealistic to expect a clear rep range (there are too many factors to take into account). I also don't agree with their recommendation to rest 3-5 min for power in favor of a shorter rest time. If it's used for sport specific training, not exactly a realistic timeframe to rest vs game scenarios. Even in a general sense; to me power based training make the most sense as a mix b/n endurance and power (for efficiency etc). $URL$ 

The majority of the people who think they need more upper chest muscle really just need more chest muscle, period. Or just as commonly, more muscle on their entire body. 

UPDATE #2 These excerpts from professional physical therapy journals (JOSPT etc…). These are few of many studies done in this area. 

Although designed as a short-term response…….in many individuals it becomes a detrimental adaptation 

What is the opposite of sit to stand? Break the motion down concentric vs eccentric contractions, joint by joint -- quite simply there isn't one. A great exercise to add to your arsenal is the hip dominant Split Stance Romanian Deadlift $URL$ (Direct Example) $URL$ (This Guy Knows His Stuff) 

A great book on it: The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It 

Chronic Injuries Chronic cases of problems with the soleus are usually associated with medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints). Treatment for chronic injuries of the soleus include: 

Furthermore, the short head appears to be more active in the latter part of an arm curl (i.e. greater elbow flexion) while the long head is more active in the early phase. 

The problem you can run into with cardio is that you draw on the same resources that you have available to build muscle. In other words: 

It’s a common belief that a rush of fast-acting carbohydrates along with whey protein is ideal. In reality is you don’t have to "spike" your insulin; a slow, insulin response (as seen with low glycemic carbohydrates) will provide much the same muscle protein synthesis benefits as a rapid, acute surge. 

Your focus isn’t to train the upper / mid / lower abs -- crunches only target the rectus abdominis. In addition, crunches places unnecessary strain on your back, which would explain the LBP. Try to think of your core as layers rather than sections. The core and low back muscles work together. The transverse abdominis (TrA) is the first muscle that fires literally every time you move. If you can keep your (TrA) correctly activated you’re on the way to more efficient movement, a stronger body, decreasing your pain etc. 

And finally, we have good old reality. What do you mean by reality? Well, aside from the huge role genetics play in the shape of your chest (a big reason why one person's chest can look very different than anothers) actually seeing a person who has JUST a big upper or lower chest doesn't actually happen. Even seeing someone with a noticeably underdeveloped upper or lower chest is surprisingly rare. I mean, once you eliminate people who fall into one of the previous 2 categories (plus genetics / chest shape) the number of legitimate cases of people with one part of their chest clearly lagging behind the other is much lower than you think. A lot lower. Which is just a nice way of saying that worrying about different "parts" of your chest is usually a big waste of time. 

Holding a Wooden Stick or a Lightly Padded Weighted Bar and Practice Lowering your body keeping your back straight Add a tactile cue (such as a plyo box or some object that you squat and try to touch each time you go down. 

Of course, all of this chest training stuff is meaningless in the absence of the small handful of things that matter most. 

Pain and numbness always results from either blood vessel or nerve compression /restriction. You’re describing a classic presentation - movement followed by tight musculature along with pain & numbness. Based on the region the majority of these cases are related to a tight Piriformis. 

The front "six-pack" muscle (your rectus abdominis) is more of a "hybrid" muscle, having roles in both spinal stability and movement. It was surprising how few studies exist relating to the growth or hypertrophy of this muscle or even it's fiber composition. 

With the long term effects known -- unless you have a terminal illness where it has been proven to be beneficial (such as adding lean muscle mass in patients with HIV) -- there isn't a reason to even consider taking them. Here are a few side effect which are often permanent: 

To learn the thrusting movement while you're maintaining a neutral back start with a slightly raised bar (with no weight) or kettle bells. 

Let’s say after altering your diet / muscle training regimen a repeat scan and finds you’ve gained 15 lbs of "lean tissue". 

– Overuse of muscles attaching to medial epicondyle – pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis are most involved. aka Golfers Elbow (even though it has nothing to do with golfing) Etiology 

However a major stabilizing structure called the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) basically helps cushion and minimize any ulnar deviation seen at rest. 

As you’re 15 years old, you’re right on cusp of when you’re able to add lean muscle mass. Does this mean you should start training for size by squatting / benching and deadlifting at age 15? Maybe, maybe not, as there are other things to consider as well.
