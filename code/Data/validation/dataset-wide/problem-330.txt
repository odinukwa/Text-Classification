I just realized that I missed a perfect example of what you want - Cockney Rhyming Slang. $URL$ You can see it in action in the film "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" (the bit in the pub where they start subtitling it) and there are other examples around. Unless you speak it you've got no chance of following it though...even if you know the base language (in this case English). 

There are a few options here, one would be the development of anti-radiation drugs or treatments that everyone in space is taking. You can handwave the details but they allow people to survive much more radiation. This also opens up various plot points such as if the meds start running low as well as helping to explain how they cope with events such as solar flares. There is a lot of radiation in space, not just from the reactors. 

No, this is definitely not the case. Increased mental power has a significant calorie and other cost so it needs to give equally significant gains for it to be favored by evolution. In other words "good enough" is fine. In particular, local maxima where you are well suited to your environment are easy to reach and then hard to leave. It might be possible to become more fit - but only by becoming less fit first. That is unlikely to happen so you are probably going to just stay where you are. For example mammals will find it very hard to evolve longer necks (the giraffe is at the limit): $URL$ Remember that evolution has no goal or objective, no long term plan. Each individual change needs to either have a benefit (or at least no cost) or over the long term it will not succeed. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for millions of years, far longer than our mayfly species has even existed, and in all that time they did not evolve intelligence of the sort you are describing. For intelligence you need just the right combinations of factors to come together in just the right sequence so that each step makes sense at that time until in the end sentience emerges. A lot of people think that our intelligence actually came out of the fact we were living together in social groups. We developed bigger brains to defeat each other, and then that incidentally let us defeat everything else. 

Rory's answer is nearly correct. You will see a tidal bulge on both the side of the moon facing towards the gas giant and on the side facing away. This is because the pull of the gas giant reduces as the distance increases. Giant <-> Nearside Ocean - Moon - Farside Ocean You can see that the nearside is closer than the moon which is itself closer than the farside. This means that the nearside gets pulled more than the moon and the farside gets pulled more so you get the bulge on both sides. However your moon is tidally locked. This potentially makes a difference. If the moon is not tidally locked then only the liquid (water in this case) has time to respond to the changing gravitational forces and you get high and low tides. However on a tidally locked planet you can expect to see the crust actually deform into the same bulged shape as the ocean would take. This would be especially true if the moon was still molten when the locking began but would gradually become true even without that. In other words you may (or may not) depending on how much the crust of the moon has adapted to the tidal locking see deep oceans at the side towards and away from the gas giant. Either way the ocean there would be static, it would have winds and waves and weather but it would not have tides due to the gas giant. There would be solar tides (the interaction of solar and lunar tides is why we have bigger and smaller tides on earth) but they are much weaker. 

You create a large ceramic pot (ceramic because it is water and air tight and easy to build into different shapes. The pot should be shaped like this: 

The same way normal intelligence services operatives are. Train them, monitor them, enforce the restrictions. If your average CIA operative were announcing it to everyone they met and telling CIA secrets they wouldn't last long. You could also create specific areas (for example a remote village somewhere) where they are allowed to live and use their powers freely. If all else fails generating some sort of dampening device that blocks their powers and making them wear it would be an option. It would be a bit unfortunate if you lost a valuable operative to a mundane car crash while their powers were blocked though. 

To answer this question you can forget convergent evolution or anything like that. Even if you seeded the planet with earth-like bacteria the chance of them evolving to something biologically human are so small that even in an infinite universe it just won't happen. A bipedal shape with a head and arms may well emerge, but it would not be biologically compatible with humans. This leaves only two options: Transplantation A seed population of biologically modern humans (so probably within the past 50 thousand years) was taken from our planet and placed on the other one. The motivations and technologies used for performing the transplantation could vary widely but the results would be what you desire. Directed Evolution Perhaps a species was facing extinction (lets say their sun was going nova) and they had not yet worked out a way to perform faster than light travel or survive the trip to another star. Instead they create robot probes and send them out, these probes have archives of their culture and nature on-board and are programmed to work with any suitable lifeforms they find and gradually guide their DNA until they match the alien's form. Once that is done the cultural archives would then be made available. Other scenarios could be imagined, but the key point is that we need an alien intelligence or mechanism that for some reason favors the human form. The machine when it arrives at a planet wipes out any existing dominant species (bye-bye dinosaurs) and then starts guiding the evolution of the suitable lifeforms towards the target form. With each generation it makes modest changes to the DNA that steer them in the desired direction while not causing them to be incompatible with the parent species. As the process advances it starts pruning the evolutionary tree where it is not moving in the desired direction (bye-bye Neanderthals). Over millions of years eventually the modified species becomes genetically compatible with the original intelligence that built the device. At that point the device makes contact and provides its archive, welcoming the latest members of the Alien's species to the vast galactic commonwealth that copies of the machine are creating all over the galaxy. 

The problem isn't the speed - although that does reduce the time in which we have to spot it. The problem is that space is vast, incredibly vast. We haven't even mapped all the asteroids in a near earth orbit yet, and most of those are bigger and closer than the object you are describing. We couldn't even detect it by its gravitational field as there would be no time for it to perturb the orbits of other things (and its mass is too low anyway). So basically we would have as much chance of spotting it as you would have of spotting an approaching sniper bullet... 

The simple answer is no, we would never know. Not unless there are records from that time we could refer back to or we can use FTL travel to go far enough away that we can look back and see. The resulting orbits afterwards are stable and we have no way of knowing that they were not always that way. Additionally anything that is odd in orbital configurations can be far more readily explained by something like a rogue planet passing through the system and disrupting things than the sun disappearing. Essentially there are no tracks in space so we have no way of knowing that something odd happened at a certain point unless we have measurements both before and after that odd thing happened. The only way it might be possible is if there were records from the pre-ragnarok civilization that were discovered and included precise details of the orbital tracks of the planets. Comparisons between those records and now might make it possible to work out that the sun disappeared and how long it was gone for but it would take advanced astronomical and mathematical knowledge and detailed records from before. 

Simply have the planet not be tectonic. If the core has cooled and the crust thickened then you can still have a magnetic field but the crust has fused into one single huge plate. You might have isolated hot spots for volcanoes but no plate borders. 

A drilling motion with the entire body rotating is possible but unlikely. What is more likely is that some form of mouth or limbs at the front do the digging and the rest of the body just follows that through the hole. You can look at earth's burrowing animals such as moles and earthworms for inspiration: Moles: $URL$ Earthworms by contrast actually eat their way through the soil. They ingest it at the front and then as they slowly move their way forwards they excrete it at the back. 

There isn't really an answer to this question. Whatever fish you like really :) The faster they grow then the fewer of them you need but if there are enough of them compared to the population of people eating them then it doesn't matter. You should look at the Inuit. They live on snow and eat basically diet very heavy in meat and fish. No agriculture and just a few berries and suchlike that they can gather occasionally. $URL$ 

I'm going to focus on the Scholars as they are the really unique proposition. Fighting people who can see the future is hard, but as mentioned in other answers the key is to find the limits to their predictive power. Can they only see a certain time ahead? Can they only see predictable events? Can they only read intent? Can they only cover a limited area? For example if they can only read intent then send strike teams into their cities. The strike teams would have step by step instructions written down and after following one set of instructions open up the next. If need be have a tree structure in the planning but the key thing is to make sure they don't know their true target until it is too late for foreknowledge to help that target. When precognition is limited to a certain area then control that area and use it like fog of war. Perform important steps inside the fog of war and only reveal them when it is too late to prevent. When it is limited to certain time then plan for the long term and in the short term just use reactive protocols to try and keep up while you rely on better long term strategic planning. Their precognition may not deal well with randomness. Make major military decisions on the roll of a dice and they will never know in advance what day you will attack. (Naturally smaller scale tactical decisions should still be made sensibly, but things like deciding the exact day or hour of attack, or which building to sleep your leaders in, etc could all be decided on the roll of a dice). 

Do motorcycle helmets have windscreen wipers? Not usually, and yet they work in all weather conditions. I'm not a motorcyclist myself but I'd expect this to be due in large part to the materials used, the wind over the glass, and the fact that you can use your hands to wipe the surface when needed. You can expect space explorers to have very good materials technology, good enough that their face plates would repel water and dust to a large degree. They can then be cleaned easily enough just by wiping them with a suitable cloth. 

You are right that tunnels under the ocean wouldn't work, they would be flooded quite apart from anything else. Your most likely case is that they got there by accident and then got lucky. The founder population were on a reasonably large ship/boat or possibly a group of boats that got driven south by a storm and eventually wrecked against the antarctic coast. They were fortunate enough to arrive in summer and survived by hunting sea life and penguins for long enough to find the entrances into the underground caves. When winter arrived they had managed to stockpile enough food that they withdrew into the caves near the surface and survived underground until summer came again. Over the next few years or even generations they survived by gathering food during summer and then hiding in the caves over winter, gradually moving deeper and deeper into the caves as they did so until they found the cavern you describe. For underground survival it's departing from reality a bit but you could have a geothermal hot spot that has melted an underground cavern to survivable temperatures. The roof of the cavern is actually mostly reasonably clear ice forming a natural lens so enough sunlight comes through during summer to support plant growth and as a result they are able to survive underground by farming and stockpiling supplies each year. 

This is a lot more plausible, we have evidence of natural nuclear reactors happening on earth. We also know that at least some of the heat in our own core comes from radioactive processes, so in fact this is at least plausible. Whether it would last as long as you want is impossible to say but it would be viable for long enough for life to evolve. A bonus idea: There is another way though, have not a rogue planet but a rogue moon. An interstallar gas giant and the life is on an icy moon in orbit around the gas giant. Tidal heating could supplement or even replace your radioactive core and still satisfy your desire for life on an interstallar planet. 

Using currently known physics it's essentially impossible. To move into more speculative realms though if you posited a material that repelled itself similar to opposed magnetic fields you could generate "floating rocks". The material would need to not repel when held together, but chunks of it would act to repel each other. Now seed sections of that material through conventional rock and wherever the concentration were high enough it would cause them to move apart. This would be unstable though and the rocks would tend to move and tumble and eventually fall to the ground if they found an area not seeded with the material, so this doesn't give us what we want. That has a number of problems so lets look at a different approach that avoids the repulsion problems. Lets go one step further and say that the material generates a force that "locks" sections of it together. So for example there is a volcano that erupts containing this material, it flows out and cools. Magnetic locking is a real phenomenon that happens with super-conducting materials and magnetic force lines although that does still allow the super-conductor to move along the force lines. Lets say this hypothetical force goes a bit further though. As it cools the force lines lock together and all the chunks of this hypothetical material lock in position with each other. Now erosion, animals, vegetation happens and the rock starts to be worn away. But the material holds its position. (Clearly it's harder than most rock so it lasts longer). Eventually you end up with isolated floating islands with vegetation growing on them all held in position and stationary. 

Nereid are an obvious choice. Kelpie might be an interesting twist Or you could mix it up with some Weresharks Undine are an option And of course Sirens have strong links to the sea 

In many ways the animal would function the same as it does with a single head, it would eat until full. It would hunt when hungry, sometimes the heads would fight each other but mostly they would get along. The "I'm full" hormones the stomach sends would reach both heads just fine for example. The main problem though is that the animal is just less well adapted as a predator than a single-headed version of itself. It's less well balanced, it's not as aerodynamic, it finds it harder to pass through small spaces or dodge obstacles. Reflexes are slowed by the two heads having to co-ordinate their actions. In fact about the only advantage it does have is that one head can keep watch while the other eats or sleeps. For apex predators though that is rarely a requirement and unless for some obscure way it evolved that way animals don't have the intelligence to co-ordinate that sort of activity. Not to mention the fact that the body would still want to all sleep at once even though the heads disagreed.
