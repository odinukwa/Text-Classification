The difference between Popper and Kuhn on scientific progress is large and important. Kuhn follows a long and dishonest tradition in philosophy that uses the following method. Pick examples of people acting like morons and then insinuate that this is a necessary feature of reality without saying it explicitly. So Kuhn produces examples where people who like to call themselves scientists act like complete dumbasses, e.g. - refusing to answer criticisms. He then insinuates that everyone is a dumbass and so that scientific progress is impossible. Now, since he never sez this explicitly, people deny that's what he meant and you can have endless discussions about it without resolving anything. And even Kuhn may sometimes have denied that's what he meant.This makes philosophers look clever to people who don't know any better. Those who do know better have described the sorts of bullshit many philosophers get up to. For a discussion of linguistic philosophers that applies to many other philosophers see Ernest Gellner's book "Words and Things" chapter VI. Popper pointed out explicitly that just looking at what scientists do is a complete non-starter for any serious discussion of philosophy of science, see "Logic of Scientific Discovery" Chapter 1 Section 2. You can't identify somebody as a scientist just cuz he sez he's a scientist. Creationists and evolutionary biologists both call themselves scientists and accuse the other group of not being scientists. They can't both be right unless science vs non-science is an invalid distinction. So then you have to explain some standard of scientific conduct or stop using the word as anything other than an expression of approval. Popper explains what the standard is: scientific practice involves seeking criticism of theories, including looking for experimental results that contradict the theory in question. More broadly, Popper pointed out that the main precondition for progress is to take the position "I may be wrong, you may be right and by an effort we may get closer to the truth." Even people with very different ideas may be able to make progress if they have a genuine critical discussion. See the title essay in Popper's book "The Myth of the Framework". Scientists often don't live up to this standard. There are reasons for this. One problem is that our culture has a lot of anti-intellectual ideas some of which are peddled by philosophers. Other problems include the fact that scientists suck up to government to get money. For a detailed discussion of Kuhn, including his intellectual dishonesty in insinuating Popper is a naive falsificationist, see the introduction to Popper's book 'Realism and the Aim of Science'. Less accessible but also interesting are Popper's replies to Kuhn in "Criticism and the growth of knowledge" edited by Lakatos and Musgrave and "The Philosophy of Karl Popper" 2 volumes edited by Schilpp. 

You aren't being very specific in saying what you mean by a conspiracy theory. This is a common problem in discussions of conspiracy theories. They are usually taken to mean something like "an account of some event that is different from the norm and somehow involves some kind of conspiracy". But there is a bright line that separates some theories labelled in that way from others. If a conspiracy theory claims that 

Position [1] has many disadvantages. First, how many people constitute the vast majority of humans and why? Your position can't answer that question because there is no non-arbitrary answer. Second, on any issue on which there is a disagreement you should express no position. And the more people adopt your idea, the fewer people will express a position on controversial topics, so those issues will never be settled if your position becomes widespread. Also, since your moral position is that morality is about what the vast majority of people think is moral and the vast majority of people would not accept your position, your position implies its own falsehood. Third, your position is completely unable to explain why people change moral positions over time. the root of the problem is that [1] doesn't recognise any objective morality that people could discover apart from what views people actually hold. So [1] is just subjectivism dressed up by saying a majority have to agree on something: the whims of a majority define morality. Fourth if you're going to deny a load of issues about what to do are moral issues, you would leave people with no way of deciding what to do on those issues. Fifth, I think you might be a bit surprised about how much stuff is not decided on your view. For example, there are whole countries where the prevailing view seems to be that it's okay to torture and murder homosexuals. So you should express no opinion on that since we don't have an agreement of the vast majority of people. The same is true of whether abortion should be legal. Finally, in many cases where the majority might have an opinion, your position is impractical as a guide to action. 'Should I have an abortion?' 'I don't know. I would have to hold a poll to determine the majority opinion on what you should do in your particular circumstances.' Position [2] is simply nonsense. If morality is objective, then it's not a matter of measuring what people think. If [1] is true, then there is no question of saying that there might be an objective fact of the matter about morality because you have defined morality as what the majority of people want. I recommend that you read some Ayn Rand since she is good at making short work of positions like the one you expressed above. See the title essay in "Philosophy: who needs it" and "The virtue of selfishness". 

This idea doesn't explain what constitutes a force, or how you would test for its existence or anything like that. What you write gets even worse: 

You say that you should not believe in truth because you find out there is no truth. There are a few problems here. (1) It doesn't matter what ideas you start out with provided you are willing to correct errors. Knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism, see "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper. (2) What problem do you know of that would be solved by the idea that there is no truth? If no such problem exists then why are you adopting the idea that there is no truth? 

Neuroscience will not replace philosophy. Indeed, it will not even be very helpful for understanding psychology. Neuroscience is roughly about the structural and chemical properties of your brain. However, your brain is a universal classical computer: it can compute anything that any other computer can compute. Such a computer can be made up of multiple types of units on the lowest level. For example, both Friedman and Toffoli gates (two different types of three bit gates) are universal for classical computation. And there are many other gates or sets of gates that are universal. As a result the actual lowest level operations don't make much difference to what your brain can do once it is capable of doing and of composing some very simple operations. This has many consequences that are fatal to the idea of replacing philosophy with neuroscience. For example, there is no particular reason to think that a particular idea is encoded in the brains of everyone in the same way. As such there is no particular reason to think that a detailed description of what is happening in the brain of one person with a particular idea will correspond to what is going on in the brain of another person with the same idea. It gets worse. The vast bulk of what people are doing refers to stuff that is outside their brains. For example, astrophysicists are trying to understand black holes and stuff like that. So to understand the brain of an astrophysicist working on black holes you would have to understand black holes and how to investigate them. And that is largely a matter of physics and philosophy of science, not neuroscience. Note that neuroscience has no bearing on philosophy of science since that is largely about what scientists ought to do not what they happen to do in reality. For example, if a scientist makes a mistake while doing a calculation we should be interested in how to fix the mistake and avoid such mistakes in the future. Even if we could read his thoughts with a brain scan there is no reason to think that this would help since what matters is figuring out the right way to do the calculation and how that differs from how he did it in reality. There is another reason to be very sceptical about how important neuroscience will be. In order to read something you have to guess about what it means and subject those guesses to criticism until you understand it. So if a neuroscientist tried to read an idea he didn't understand from somebody's brain he would be in the same position as anybody else as far as understanding it is concerned. And since the stuff that is in the person's brain and not written down anywhere has not been considered carefully and criticised, it will not be "written" in such a way as to be easy to understand. A neuroscientist who wanted to understand some philosophical issue would be better of asking questions and having critical discussions rather than looking at patterns of brain activity. Claiming that philosophy will be replaced by studying the brain is about as plausible as saying that the study of literature will be replaced by the study of ink and paper. 

Your question uses a false assumption, namely that true ideas can be proven to be true are objective. By that standard, no idea would be objective, including logical ideas. To prove an idea using an argument you would have to prove that the premises and rules of inference are correct and to prove them you need another argument, whose premisses and rules of inference have to be proven, so you get an infinite regress. The way you actually find truth is to guess and then criticise the guesses (this criticism can include experiments, looking for inconsistencies with other ideas, looking for problems that your ideas don't solve and other stuff), as explained by Karl Popper, see "Realism and the Aim of Science", Chapter I. You can't prove that you have found truth, but you can try to weed out bad ideas. Some ideas are put in such a way as to make it difficult to tell what their implications are, such as the work of bad philosophers. But these ideas can still be criticised by pointing out that since you can't tell what their implications are they can't be used to solve problems, which is a criticism. 

Quantum theory is not a bunch of stories. It is a universal physical theory that explains everything you see around you, except for the interaction of objects with the gravitational field. Lots of people, including physicists, don't want to accept this, and so describe quantum mechanics in terms of an ad hoc set of rules. For an example of this denial, see the answer above that describes QT as having 'quirks'. This sort of nonsense may be where you got the impression that QT is just a bunch of stories. In reality, quantum theory has deep connections to relativity and the theory of computation and most of the features people object to in QT play a role in the explanations it gives: $URL$ See Deutsch's other papers on the same site, and his books "The Fabric of Reality" and "The Beginning of Infinity".
