It turns out that this follows by Cauchy-Schwarz and invariance of the measure on $M$. Using the fact that we are integrating over the compact subset $H\subseteq G$, we have for any compact subset $K\subseteq M$, $$\int_K |f(\mu)(x)|^2\,dx = \int_K\int_H\int_H c(gx)\mu(gx)c(g'x)\mu(g'x)\,dg\,dg'dx$$ $$\leq\int_H\int_H\langle f_g(\mu),f_{g'}(\mu)\rangle_{L^2(K)}\,dg\,dg'$$ $$\leq\int_H\int_H ||f_g\mu||_{L^2(K)}||f_{g'}\mu||_{L^2(K)}\,dg\,dg'.$$ where $f_g(\mu)(x):=f(\mu)(gx)$ and $f_{g'}(\mu)(x):=f(\mu)(g'x)$. This is finite since $H$ has finite volume, and claim 1 is verified. The proof of claim 2 is similar, using the equivalent criterion that $f$ is continuous if and only if for any $K$ there exists a constant $C_K$ such that $||f(\mu)||_{L^2(K)}\leq C_K ||\mu||_{L^2(M)}$. The constant $C_K$ can be chosen to be $(\text{vol}(H))^2$. 

Let $G$ be a Lie group and $C_r^*(G)$ and $C^*(G)$ be its reduced and maximal group $C^*$-algebras respectively. The left-regular representation of a group $G$ induces a surjective map $$\lambda_G:C^*(G)\rightarrow C^*_r(G),$$ so $C_r^*(G)$ is a quotient of $C^*(G)$. I am wondering whether $C_r^*(G)$ is in fact a direct summand of $C^*(G)$? Thanks for your help. Edit: As YCor commented, more precisely what I am looking for is a $*$-homomorphism $f:C_r^*(G)\rightarrow C^*(G)$ such that $\lambda_G\circ f=\text{id}_{C_r^*(G)}$ and $f(x)y=0$ for all $x\in C_r^*(G)$ and $y\in\ker\lambda_G$. That is, a direct summand in the sense of $C^*$-algebra direct sums. 

I have seen Kasparov (in his recent JNCG paper) show Fredholmness of classes in $K_0^G(X)$ represented by elliptic operators, but Baum-Connes-Higson seem to assert that this is true for any $K$-homology cycle. Any references/proofs would be great. Thanks! 

Let $(H,||\cdot||_H)$ be a Banach space and $K$ a (not necessarily closed) subspace. Suppose that $K$ is a Banach space under another norm $||\cdot||_K$, which satisfies $$||x||_H\leq ||x||_K$$ for all $x\in K$. Let $(S,\mu)$ be a measure space and $f:S\rightarrow K$ a strongly measurable function in the sense of Bochner, with respect to both $||\cdot||_K$ and $||\cdot||_H$. That is, there exist sequences of simple functions $\phi_n$ and $\psi_n$ on $S$ taking values in $K$ and $H$ respectively such that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} ||f(s) - \phi_n(s)||_{K} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} ||f(s) - \psi_n(s)||_{H} = 0$$ for $\mu$-almost all $s\in S$. Suppose now that $f$ satisfies $$\int_S ||f(s)||_H\,d\mu(s) < \infty,$$ so that, by a criterion of Bochner, $f$ is integrable as a function with values in $H$. Denote $$h := \int_S f(s) d\mu(s).$$ Question: If $h\in K$, then does it follow that $f$ is Bochner-integrable in $K$? That is, does there exist a sequence of simple functions $\phi_n$ such that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_S ||f(s) - \phi_n(s)||_{K}\,d\mu(s) = 0?$$ 

I should say that although I'm asking this question about Dirac operators in particular, it really applies to more general unbounded operators. Thanks. 

When $H = L^2(X;E)$, where $E$ is a vector bundle over $X$, is the completion $\mathcal{H}$ the same as the the completion of $C_c(X,E)$ (viewed as a $C_c(G)$-module) into a $C_r^*(G)$-module? How does one prove Fredholmness of $\mathcal{F}$ using the axioms for an abstract elliptic operator and $G$-compactness of $X$, as stated in the paper? 

For example, a construction is given on page 8 of $URL$ I'm interested in whether one can control the gradient of such a cut-off function at infinity. That is, might it be possible to construct $c$ so that the norm of its differential, $|dc|$, fades to $0$ at infinity? (Or to construct $c$ so that it is a limit of such functions in the space of bounded continuous functions $C_b(M)$ with the sup-norm?) (By "fading to $0$ at infinity", I mean that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a compact $K\subseteq M$ such that on $M\backslash K$, $|dc|$ is uniformly less than $\epsilon$.) 

I believe the continuity statement is equivalent to showing that for any sequence $\mu_n$ converging to $\mu$ in $L^2(M)$ and for any compact subset $K\subseteq M$, $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_K |f(\mu_n)-f(\mu)|^2\,dx = 0.$$ Since the action is proper, the integral over $G$ reduces to an integral over a compact subset $H\subseteq G$, for a fixed $K$. Thus if $\mu$ were continuous, I can see that claim $1$ holds. But I'm not sure how to proceed for general $\mu\in L^2(M)$. (Here $dg$ is a Haar measure on $G$ and $dx$ is a $G$-invariant measure on $M$.) Thanks for your help! 

Suppose $X$ is a complete Riemannian manifold on which a Lie group $G$ acts properly. Let $\rho(x)$ be the distance function from a chosen point $x_0\in X$ to our point $x\in X$. Suppose also that all sectional curvatures of $X$ are uniformly bounded, so that the volume of balls in $X$ (as a function of radius) grows at most exponentially. Under these conditions, how would one prove that the following function $f: G\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by $$g\mapsto \int_X e^{-c\rho(x)-c\rho(g^{-1}x)}\,dx,$$ is in $L^1(G)$ for $c\in\mathbb{R}$ sufficiently large? I'm not sure how to use the constraint on the volume growth of balls, so it would be very helpful if someone could write a fairly detailed calculation showing how this is done. Many thanks! 

I'm wondering whether there exists a generalisation of Bochner integration with values in a Hilbert $A$-module $M$, where $A$ is a general $C^*$-algebra rather than $\mathbb{C}$ (and whether there are notes out there on this). When $A=\mathbb{C}$, one knows that if $(S,\mu)$ is a measure space and $f:S\rightarrow H$ is a Bochner-integrable function with values in $H$, then the identity $$\langle x,\,\int_S f(s)\,d\mu(s)\rangle = \int_S\langle x,\, f(s)\rangle\,d\mu(s),$$ is satisfied for all $x\in H$. Does there exist an integration theory for more general $A$ that still has this property? That is, if $(S,\mu)$ is a measure space and $f:S\rightarrow M$ is an integrable function in the sense of this theory, then is it true that $$\langle x,\,\int_S f(s)\,d\mu(s)\rangle = \int_S\langle x,\, f(s)\rangle\,d\mu(s),$$ for all $x\in M$? Thanks. 

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold on which a Lie group $G$ acts properly, such that the orbit space $M/G$ is compact. Suppose $c:M\rightarrow [0,\infty)$ is a compactly supported smooth function with the property that it integrates to $1$ along each orbit on $M$. That is for all $x\in M$ we have: $$\int_G c(gx)\,dg = 1.$$ I wish to verify that for any $\mu\in L^2(M)$, $$f:\mu\mapsto f(\mu),$$ where $$f(\mu)(x):=\int_G c(gx)\mu(gx)\,dg,$$ defines a continuous map $f:L^2(M)\rightarrow L^2_{\text{loc}}(M)$. I am having trouble verifying 

Let $X$ be a non-compact complete Riemannian manifold and $P$ a first-order elliptic pseudodifferential operator on $X$. Let $Q$ be a parametrix for $P$, so that $PQ - 1 = T$ and $QP - 1 = R$ are lower order operators. If $X$ were compact, then the operators $Q$, $T$, $PQ$ and $PT$ would all be bounded on $L^2(X)$, since they have non-positive order. My question is: when $X$ is non-compact, is it possible to choose the parametrix $Q$ so that $Q$, $T$, $PQ$, $PT$ are still all bounded on $L^2(X)$? 

Suppose $D$ is a first-order differential operator on a manifold $M$ and that the inverse $(D+t)^{-1}:H^0(M)\rightarrow H^1(M)$ exists for all $t > 0$, where $H^i(M)$ is the $i^\text{th}$ Sobolev space. Let $\psi\in C_c^\infty(M)\subseteq H^0(M)$. Then in particular $(D+t)^{-1}\psi$ is smooth. Also, for any $\phi\in C_c^\infty(M)$, the value of the function $(D+t)\phi$ at $x\in M$ is simply $$((D+t)\phi)(x) = D\phi(x) + t\phi(x),$$ which in particular depends continuously on the parameter $t$. I'm interested in whether this is true for the inverse operator. More precisely: Question: At a fixed point $x\in M$, does the value $((D+t)^{-1}\psi)(x)$ depend continuously on $t$? 

I have a basic question concerning Atiyah and Schmid's paper "A Geometric Construction of the Discrete Series for Semisimple Lie Groups", Inventiones mathematicae 42 (1977): 1-62". I will use the same notation as in the paper: $G$ is a semisimple Lie group with finite centre, $K$ its maximal compact subgroup, and $\Gamma$ an appropriately chosen discrete subgroup of $G$. It is stated (page 12) that the index of a Dirac operator on $\Gamma\backslash G/K$ twisted by a representation $V$ of $K$ is given by $\int_{\Gamma\backslash G/K} f(\Theta,\Phi)$, where $f$ is a polynomial, $\Phi$ the curvature of the bundle $\cal{V}$, formed using $V$, and $\Theta$ the cuvature of $\Gamma\backslash G/K$. This means that $f(\Theta,\Phi)=C(V)dx$ is then a constant multiple of the volume form. Question: it is then stated (page 14) that $C(V)$ depends in a polynomial fashion on the highest weight $\mu$ of the representation $V$ of $K$, which "follows easily from the Weyl character formula and the relations between characters and characteristic classes." Would someone be able to supply a reference where I can find the relations between characters and characteristic classes being referred to? Cheers. 

For any subset $L\subseteq M$ such that $\pi(L)$ is compact in $M/G$, the intersection of $L$ with the support of $c$ is compact (or its closure is). $\int_G c(g^{-1}x) dg = 1$ for all $x\in M$. 

Let $X$ be a (possibly non-compact) complete Riemannian manifold on which a Lie group $G$ acts smoothly and properly. Fix $x_0\in X$, and let $\rho(x)$ denote the Riemannian distance function from $x\in X$ to $x_0$. How might one show that, for large enough $\kappa\in\mathbb{R}$, the following function is in $L^1(G)$: $$g\mapsto ||e^{-\kappa\rho(x)-\kappa\rho(g^{-1}x)}||_\infty?$$ Here the supremum norm is taken over $x\in X$. Cheers. 

Emerson and Meyer's Paper "Dualizing the Coarse Assembly Map" (2006) states the following Proposition (5.1): Let $X = [0,\infty)$ be the ray with its Euclidean metric coarse structure. Then the reduced K-theory of the Higson compactification $\eta X$ of $X$ is uncountable. The authors state that this is proved in the paper of A. N. Dranishnikov, J. Keesling and V. V. Uspenskij entitled "On the Higson corona of uniformly contractible spaces" (1998). However, I cannot seem to locate this proof within the reference, which is only 13 pages long. It is probably the case that I do not understand enough to be able to find the statement from which this Proposition follows. Would someone more knowledgeable please point me to such a statement (if it exists) within the paper of Dranishnikov et. al.? Many thanks! 

Let $D$ be a self-adjoint (in the $H^0$-inner product) first-order differential operator on a manifold $M$, where $H^i$ stands for the $i$-th Sobolev space on $M$. Then $D$ extends to a bounded operator $H^{i+1}\rightarrow H^{i}$ for each $i\geq 0$, self-adjoint in the $i$-norm. To distinguish between norms, let us write $(D^2+1)_i$ for $D^2+1:H^{i+2}\rightarrow H^i$. Then for each $i\geq 0$, $(D^2+1)_i$ has a bounded positive inverse $$(D^2+1)_i^{-1}:H^i\rightarrow H^{i+2}.$$ Thus for every $i$ we get a unique positive square root $(D^2+1)_i^{-1/2}$, which is a bounded operator $H^i\rightarrow H^i$. The range of this square root can be shown to be $H^{i+1}$. I have a number of (related) questions about these operators. Question 0: Is $(D^2+1)^{-1/2}_i$ a bounded operator $H^i\rightarrow H^{i+1}$? Question 1: Do $(D^2+1)_i^{-1/2}$ and $(D^2+1)_j^{-1/2}$ for $i\neq j$ coincide on their common domain $H^{\text{max}\{i,j\}}$? Question 2: Is the domain of the unique (unbounded) positive square root of $(D^2+1)_i$ equal to $H^{i+1}$? Let us call this square root $(D^2+1)_i^{1/2}.$ Question 3: Is $(D^2+1)_i^{-1/2}$ the inverse of $(D^2+1)_i^{1/2}$? Thanks for your help. 

If $M$ is a non-compact smooth manifold, then an analogue of Rellich's lemma states that the operator of multiplication by a compactly supported function $f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is a compact operator between Sobolev spaces $H^l(M)\rightarrow H^k(M)$ for $l>k$. Suppose we have such an $f$ together with another non-compact manifold $N$. Define $$\tilde{f}:M\times N\rightarrow\mathbb{C},\qquad\tilde{f}(m,n):=f(m).$$ Is multiplication by $\tilde{f}$ a compact operator $H^l(M\times N)\rightarrow H^k(M\times N)$ for $l>k$? 

I'm confused about a seemingly basic point about a classical result on positive scalar curvature and would appreciate it if an expert could help me out. Let $M^n$ be a closed spin manifold with spinors $S$. Let $A$ be a $C^*$-algebra and $V$ be a flat Hilbert $A$-module bundle over $M$. Then one can form a twisted Dirac operator $D$ acting on sections of $S\otimes V$. This operator defines a class $[D]\in KK_n(C(M),A)$, where $C(M)$ denotes the continuous functions on $M$, and it has an index in $K_n(A)$. (For example, this is explained in section 3 of Jonathan Rosenberg's 1986 paper C$^*$-Algebras, Positive Scalar Curvature and the Novikov Conjecture III; the real case is studied there but it seems to apply equally well to the complex case.) It's sometimes mentioned, or at least implied, e.g. in the above paper and on p. 264 of $URL$ that when $M$ admits a positive scalar curvature metric, the index of $D$ vanishes in $K_n(A)$. The subscript $n$ is what I'm trying to understand. The argument (p. 332 of the first paper above) seems to be to reduce the computation to the case when $n$ is even, where the result holds by the Lichnerowicz formula (this case I understand). Now suppose $M$ is odd-dimensional. Consider the Dirac operator $D_{M\times S^1}$ on $M\times S^1$, where $S^1$ is a flat circle. Then $[D_{M\times S^1}]\in KK(C(M\times S^1),A).$ Using the embedding of the open set $M\times\mathbb{R}\hookrightarrow M\times S^1$, $[D_{M\times S^1}]$ maps to a class in $KK(C_0(M\times\mathbb{R}),A)$, which after applying the isomorphism to $KK_1(C(M),A)$ gives $[D]$. Since $M\times S^1$ also has a metric of positive scalar curvature, obtained by taking the product of the metrics on $M$ and $S^1$, the index of $[D_{M\times S^1}]$ vanishes in $K_0(A)$. Question: How does this imply that the index of the Dirac operator $D$ on $M$ vanishes in $K_1(A)$? It seems to me that we are taking two indices, the index in $K_0(A)$ on the larger manifold $M\times S^1$, and a more "refined" index in $K_1(A)$ on $M$, and that one may want to use the isomorphism $K_1(A)\cong K_0(A\otimes C_0(\mathbb{R}))$ somewhere.
