This ties into how one marks up diphthongs and polyphthongs. Strictly speaking you can add a non-syllabic marker (like the bow /̯̯̯/, or the more-open diacritic to closed vowels or the more-closed diacritic to an open vowel) to any vowel to produce a semi-vowel suitable for a diphthong, if how you define diphthong is a semivowel preceding or following a vowel. As usual for IPA, frequent/common semivowels get their own symbols, which is why we have /j w ɥ ɰ/. (Pet peeve: IPA isn't very good at showing diphthongs at a phonetic level, or rather, there seems to have been insuffcient interest in typological comparisons of diphthongs such that there is no agreed upon way of marking the difference between for instance English /aj/ in "hi" and Norwegian /ɑˑi̯/ "hai" or what have you.) 

Somewhere I have several tools that can generate this from a SIL Toolbox interlinear via xml-export and xslt. 

You've already checked out wikipedia right? "Compound (linguistics)" Have you googled it on Google Scholar at all? Noun compounds: This is common in Germanic languages. For instance, Norwegian "jernbanestasjonsmesterbolig" (jernbane stasjon mester bolig). Not a word you'll find in a dictionary but easily made when needed. The only thing that limits length is practicality. There are plenty of noun-noun compounds in English too but because the newly minted ones are in general spelled with spaces they don't stand out as much. For English you might want to start with Paula Downing (1977): "On the creation and use of English compound nouns", Language, issue 4. For a smorgasboard of compounds, read up on Sanskrit. Romance languages tend to compounds of the type verb+noun, like "tocadiscos" (toca discos) IIRC, "plays records" = record player. Verb compounds: You've read "Compound verbs" on Wikipedia? Analysis: The interesting, less homework-y question here is whether there are open-source morpohological analyzers out there now. Maybe one based on for instance Johannesen and Hauglin (1996) "An Automatic analysis of compounds"? You've alrady checked the NLTK I assume? It's easy enough to make one yourself, for Germanic languages at least. You need a wordlist, potentially with declined forms, and if the word you have is not on the list, you try to match the words that are, as prefixes or suffixes, to the word you have. Go for longest match. (You'll also need some info on epenthetic sounds, like -e- and -s- in many Norwegian compounds. Throw away these, at least at first). The trick is that if there's more than two nouns you'll end up with potentially more than one tree-structure for the same word. Take "jernbanestasjonsmester", it can split at least two ways: "jernbane" + "stasjonsmester" and "jernbanestasjon" + "mester" (the -s- is epenthetic). Sometimes that doesn't change the meaning, sometimes it can change the meaning, sometimes it is used by comedians for comedic effect, setting up a joke that uses one split at the start and another later on in the same joke. And then there's the puns it makes possible... 

If Hebrew is really an Indo-European language due to contact with Indo-European then English is a Romance language due to Norman French and a ton of loans from Latin. What nonsense. Languages don't go about changing what family they descend from. English certainly is not a continuation of Norman French! You can make a new language through creolization, is this Zuckermann claiming that Hebrew is a creole? Dixon's punctuated equilibrium model (see "The Rise and Fall of Languages") doesn't explain Hebrew either as it needs more time and several languages to work with. Then there are some that consider Modern Hebrew to be a naturalized conlang (constructed language that has become a natural language through use). If that is the case it doesn't really descend from anything. 

Languages encode a lot of information about its surroundings. Names for plants and animals, what the plants and animals are useful for, various phenomena, things that are relevant for the speakers. Think of it as a specialized encyclopedia. When a language dies, the encyclopedia dies with it. Often, the changeover in language is followed by a changeover in culture as well, so that the previously relevant information is no longer relevant and there is no agreed-upon way of talking about it. Want to know what's edible in the area you are in? Sorry mate, the locals have been assimiliated into a more westernized culture and only eats the same stuff you do now. Want to know how the locals used to make the paint of a particular shade of blue that is more long-lasting than anything found in the west? Sorry, the conquerors killed the people who knew how for being witches and cut out the tongues of those who spoke the language. Want to know whether this fungus has been used for medical purposes? No can do, the locals who used the fungus died of cholera in the fifties, etc. ad nauseam. For science, the loss of information is a tragedy. 

Norwegian has borrowed the semantically murky derivation {-is} from Swedish, I've only seen it make nouns. Unfortunately that morph is so short it probably haven't been indexed by Google Scholar. I'll keep an eye out for links on it. 

I don't know of any standard models but size, source(s), quality, fitness for purpose, language(s) and copyright vettedness/copyright restrictions seems like relevant factors. Big size (a copy of the internet) isn't necessarily an asset if what the buyer needs is a domain-specific high quality corpus. There are many corpora already for English, fewer for other languages, but fewer are studying other languages so the market is smaller and they can pay less. Corpora with too strict licensing can be worthless because you can't use the data for what you need to use it for or there are restrictions on publishing methods etc. As to vettedness: not good to have to scrap research because the seller didn't have the right to sell the raw data in the first place... There was a lot of copyright angst when I dipped my toes into corpus linguistics years ago. Advice: Be a salesman, pose as a buyer to figure out what the competition is doing :) 

The list in "A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages", Carl Darling Buck, 1949, has been used in several comparisons. It has 22 semantic categories of words, like bodyparts, clothing, time etc. AFAIK it includes all the words on the Swadesh list and some 1200 others in addition. The following two collections based this book are online: World Loanword Database and The Intercontinental Dictionary Series. The former has more words and the latter has more languages. 

Words borrowed from other languages are a big source of rare spellings for existing sounds. If the original spelling and pronunciation are both kept, a new way of spelling might have been introduced. Prior to writing, only the pronunciation could be borrowed so the problem could not occur. In some languages it is customary to adopt the spelling of borrowings to the spelling of the receiving language, leading to more consistent and easier spelling rules. Another method to maintain a simple system is to change the pronunciation to fit the spelling. Several societies that choose to keep the original spelling seem to have something I had never heard of until about five years ago, spelling bees, that is: competitions to spell rare words! These days it is common that people learning another language learn to read and write it at the same time, which might lead to knowing how to spell a word but not how to pronounce it, if the spelling system is sufficiently complex. 

Lexicographically, the first COBUILD dictionary heralded a paradigm shift, and I was very lucky to find a copy when I was learning English. I've been looking for something like a COBUILD-style dictionary for Geman and French for a very long time. I've started to suspect that it maybe takes too many resources to build one (a corpus with few enough rights limitations and a trained staff and several years for the assembly), and that's why there aren't any obvious candidates for other languages. 

You need to look at how they pattern, where they can be used, how they behave in the phrase and clause. If "a/an" and "the" go in the same position relative to a noun, then having a term that covers the words that go in that position is worthwhile, ditto for having terms for the position itself, and how other words place themselves relative to the noun and the whatchamacallit.
