First, here is another reason that hasn't been supplied a reason that a field could have the property that no polynomial is co-finite. If the field is $\mathbb{R}$ and a polynomial $f(x)$ has no real roots, then $f(x)+c$ doesn't either when $c$ is a small number. That's because the map from a set of roots in $\mathbb{C}$ to the corresponding polynomial is an open map, and $\mathbb{R}$ is a closed subset. I would suppose that there are other topological fields $k$ such that the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$ (or maybe some completion of it) has this open map property. [Edit: Actually GMS and DLS have already both suggested $p$-adic continuity arguments, which is a similar point about using topology.] Second, it seems like the answers so far take the question the wrong away around. Let $f$ be a polynomial over a field $k$, and mark a set of values $A \subset k$. Suppose that you adjoin to $k$ some root of $f(x)-b$ for every $b \in k \setminus A$. Suppose that you keep doing that with the new field $k'$, and keep going forever to obtain a partial algebraic closure $\tilde{k}$. (It will not be the full algebraic closure because all extensions are bounded by $\deg f$.) Then does any $f(x)-a$ have a root in $\tilde{k}$, with $a \in A$? If not, then you have a counterexample. If this is unavoidable, then no counterexample is possible. The field $\tilde{k}$ seems far from unique as described. However, you could make a larger field by splitting $f(x)-b$ completely rather than by adjoining just one root. [Edit: Removed a not particularly original thought about an obstruction coming from Galois groups.] 

$\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}$ Suppose that $n$ is a large and known integer (say, with 100 digits) and that you are given access to a function $$f(x) = x^a + x^b$$ with unknown exponents $a,b \in \Z/n$. You are allowed to evaluate $f$ on any cyclic ring $\Z/q$ with a solution to $x^n = 1$, where $x$ and $q$ are of your choosing as long as $\gcd(n,q) = 1$. You are allowed several evaluations with distinct $x$ and $q$. For simplicity you can assume that $q$ is a product of primes (which may not be distinct) that are all 1 mod $n$ and that $x$ is an $n$th root of unity, since for instance $n$ could be prime. Linnik's effective version of Dirichlet's theorem says that there is a ready supply of values of $q$. My ultimate question: What algorithms in number theory are available to find the exponents $a$ and $b$? Of course you can find them in principle with one enormous value of $q$. The question is what is known about efficiency as a function of $d$, the number of digits of $n$. The problem is like discrete logarithm, but more complicated because there are two terms. I am also interested in this more tangible question: Can you find a moderate value of $q$ such that $f$ is injective? Heuristically, $O(d)$ digits should be enough. I am thinking that GRH implies that $f$ is strictly injective for most values of $q$ with $O(d)$ digits --- is this true? Can you prove unconditionally $f$ that is usually injective in this range, or usually mostly injective? 

There is an amazing theorem of Morrey and Grauert that says that not only does every (paracompact) smooth manifold have a real analytic structure, the real analytic structure is unique. Using Whitney's ideas, you can show that two real analytic manifolds $M$ and $M'$ that are diffeomorphic are also real-analytic equivalent, if they both embed analytically in Euclidean space. And of course Whitney lets you assume that one of them does. The question boils down to whether real analytic real-valued functions on a real analytic manifold separate points. Morrey and Grauert proved that they do. Although I don't understand either proof, I remember that a key step in Grauert's proof is to make the tangent bundle of $M$ into a complex manifold, and show that it is a Stein manifold. Anyway, the result is much harder than what Whitney did, which is a very good but expected application of the Weierstrass approximation theorem. To understand the issues, you can consider instead real algebraic manifolds in the geometric topology sense (rather than in the algebraic geometry sense). These are called Nash manifolds. A circle has an embeddable Nash structure, the one where trigonometric functions separate points. But $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is another Nash circle, one of zillions that do not embed as Nash manifolds into Euclidean space. 

To expand on Ryan's comment: A handle decomposition of a manifold is a restricted type of quotient of a disjoint union of handles. An $n$-dimensional $k$-handle is by definition the manifold $B^k \times B^{n-k}$, with the decoration that $(\partial B^k) \times B^{n-k}$ is its lower boundary and $B^k \times (\partial B^{n-k})$ is its upper boundary. The allowed quotient is obtained by induction. The $k$-skeleton $M_k$ is the union of all of the $\le k$-handles. To make $M_{k+1}$, you identify part of $\partial M_k$ with all of the lower boundary of the $k+1$-handles using a closed embedding of the latter into the former. That is a complete definition, although maybe more conditions can also be added. In addition to upper and lower boundary, the handles have upper and lower 1-dimensional radial foliations. The upper radial foliation is singular at the core of the handle and the lower radial foliation is singular at the co-core. There is a lemma that a handle decomposition can be extended radially. The lemma allows you to convert a handle decomposition of $M$ into a special kind of atlas of charts of $M$. It also allows you to convert the handle decomposition into a CW complex using the cores of the handles, or a dual CW complex using the co-cores. Moreover, you can always simplify a handle decomposition of a closed $n$-manifold so that there is only one $0$-handle and only one $n$-handle. This answers Burago's question if $M$ has a handle decomposition. It is easy to make a handle decomposition of any smooth or PL manifold (in the latter case, say, any triangulated PL manifold) where everything as described holds. For the topological case, it was proven by Kirby and Siebenmann that every $n$-manifold with $n \ge 5$ has a handle decomposition. Also every $n$-manifold with $n \le 3$ has a unique PL and a unique smooth structure. It was proven by Freedman that a 4-manifold with no PL structure (equivalently, no smooth structure) does NOT have a handle decomposition. So, the answer to Burago's question is yes for all closed manifolds except possibly for non-smoothable 4-manifolds. I suspect that the answer is still yes for all 4-manifolds. Topological manifolds are a difficult theory and I am hand-waving a bit with this answer. But I think that it is a correct description of topological handle decompositions. 

Yes for "hope" 1. This theorem was proven by Moser using volume-preserving flows. A manifold with a volume form is the same thing as a manifold with an atlas of charts modeled on the volume-preserving diffeomorphism pseudogroup. He found an argument that can be adapted to either the symplectic case or the volume case. I cited this result in this paper, where I also established a similar result for the volume-preserving PL pseudogroup. In the PL case, the corresponding decoration on the manifold is a piecewise constant volume form. In my opinion, the most exciting result on this theme is the Ulam-Oxtoby theorem. (But Moser's version is the most useful one and the most elegant.) The theorem is that if you have a topological manifold with any Borel measure that has no atoms and no bald spots, then it is modeled on the pseudogroup of volume-preseserving homeomorphisms. For example, you can start with Lebesgue measure in the plane and add uniform measure on a circle, and there is a homeomorphism that takes that measure to Lebesgue measure. For a long time I have wondered about the pseudogroup of volume-preserving Lipschitz maps. The question is whether there is a corresponding cone of measures, and if so, how to characterize it. 

A more rigorous version of Scott's answer: If a topology on a group $G$ is translation-invariant, then it also defines a uniformity on $G$, by definition a distinguished set of neighborhoods of the diagonal $G \times G$ that is analogous to a metric. Actually, in the present example with $G = \mathbb{Z}$, the uniformity comes from a metric. Like the metric spaces that they generalize, uniform spaces have completions. The completion of $\mathbb{Z}$ with respect to the uniformity cited by Furstenberg is exactly the adelic profinite completion of $\mathbb{Z}$. Or if $G$ is any group, there is a similar topology generated by finite-index subgroups, and a uniformity, and the completion is the profinite completion. 

I'm teaching a course right now in which many students face these issues for the first time. I have to care about something to remember it; otherwise I am utterly incapable of memorizing anything. My main method to care about a proof is to want to be convinced of the thing being proved, the way that a trial jury wants to be convinced. If the stated theorem just isn't news to you, ask yourself if you know whether it remains true if you change it slightly. Would the same proof still work? Example 1: det(AB) = det(A)det(B) for square matrices. It seems completely unreasonable to dismiss a theorem like this as "obvious". If you haven't learned a proof, then the only evidence left is argument by example and argument by authority. Many variations of this equation certainly aren't true, so why is this one true? The goal is to learn the proof well enough to be able to persuade someone else who doesn't believe you. Example 2: Every fraction is a repeating decimal. This is a familiar fact and we all "know" it. So make a variation to have something more newsworthy to prove. If every a/b must be a repeating decimal, then presumably you can find a bound for when it starts to repeat. For instance, it seems unlikely that 1/29 requires a million digits to start to repeat. Does the proof that a/b must repeat establish a reasonable bound on when? 

You can't expect a closed formula for this surface area. The perimeter of an ellipse, much less the perimeter of a superellipse or the surface area of an ellipsoid or a superellipsoid, is already an integral that doesn't have a formula in the usual sense of an elementary formula. Instead, people did what they always do when an integral is meaningful but has no formula: They named it. That one is called an elliptic integral, but it's just for the case $m=2$. For the $m=2$ case, there is a way out in 3 dimensions: After you define elliptic functions to be the answer in 2 dimensions (for not just the full perimeter but the perimeter of arcs), you can express the 3-dimensional surface area in terms of them without naming any more functions. However, I don't expect that to happen for general $m$, which in any case only reduces the dimension of the problem by 1 instead of solving it. It's true that your superellipsoids are in the special case that the three semiradii are equal, but I don't think that that rescues you for general values of $m$. Obviously it does rescue you when $m=2$. What you really want to do for your problem is integrate numerically. You might want a convenient initial change of variables such as $$(a,b,c) = (|x/r|^m,|y/r|^m,|z/r|^m),$$ so that you then get an integral over the triangle $a+b+c=1$. After that there are a variety of numerical integration methods that converge quickly. For instance, you can do the double integral by doing Gaussian integration twice. This particular strategy is not robust as $m \to \infty$, but you didn't say that you needed that limit. An alternative which I guess is robust in that limit, in the case that the semiradii are all equal, is to integrate over one 1/24 region of the spherical angle with the change of coordinates: $$(x,y,z) \propto (1,u,v)$$ with $0 \le u \le v \le 1$. That is also an integral over a triangle. 

In other words, the question is essentially a matroid problem. The set $F(H)$ is a spanning set in the module $U^\perp$, and you are interested in the matroid structure of $F(H)$ for a generic $H$, because a circuit or linearly dependent subset $F(S)$ gives you an $S$ such that $V \cap X_S$ is larger than expected. I wrote a short program in Sage to compute this matroid for $D_n$, where the element $c$ is a reflection, using a convenient matroid package written by David Joyner. 

Today I learned this interesting fact from Jerry Kaminker: If $A$ is an abelian group such that $\mathrm{Hom}(A,\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{Ext}(A,\mathbb{Z})$ are both countably generated, then in fact $A$ is finitely generated. This is known in the literature, in some old papers by Nunke-Rotman, Chase, and Mitchell. It makes me interested in possible generalizations. Suppose that $M$ is a left module over a ring $R$ and that $\mathrm{Ext}^k(M,R)$ is countably generated for all $k$. For which $R$ can you conclude that $M$ is finitely generated or, better, finitely resolved? Any commutative Noetherian ring with finite projective dimension? Is there a countability restriction missing from this proposed generalization? What about non-commutative rings? The result has been stated for any countable PID rather than just for $\mathbb{Z}$. In fact Mitchell says that if $R$ is a countable PID and $M$ is infinitely generated, then $$|\mathrm{Hom}(M,R)|\cdot|\mathrm{Ext}(M,R)| = 2^{|M|}.$$ 

There is strong circumstantial evidence that the question came from a personal conversation with Bogomolov. First, Gromov's paper has more than 50 references, but he doesn't cite Bogomolov at all. Second, he does later in the paper thank Bogomolov for a helpful conversation, referring to him in nickname form as Fedya. They are about the same age, they both have appointments at NYU, and Gromov has thanked Bogomolov in papers before. Third, when I skimmed over Bogomolov's papers (okay, the abstracts and some introductions), I couldn't find anything directly bearing on the question. On the other hand, I did find a paper by Carlson and Toledo that said that 30 years ago, Gromov introduced the partial ordering on $n$-manifolds given by the existence of a map $M \to N$ with non-zero degree. The broad question is what this partial ordering looks like. Obviously Gromov norm is an important invariant for this question. Unless you ask Gromov or Bogomolov directly, it may make more sense to make an educated guess based on Gromov's summary. I would say, if $X$ is a closed, smooth, $n$-dimensional algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$, is there a closed, smooth $n$-fold $Y$ with a non-constant morphism $Y \to X$, such that $Y$ also fibers smoothly over a complex curve? Unless there is some clear reason that this question is misstated, it surely works as motivation for Gromov's question. 

For $D_4$ and $D_6$, the program found various matroid circuits of size 4 and 6, respectively. For $D_5$ and $D_7$, it did not find any non-trivial circuits. I do not understand their full structure, but there they are. For $D_8$, it eventually reporteed that there are 362 non-trivial circuits of size 8 and none that are smaller. The first one listed is $S = \{1,x,x^2,x^3,y,xy,x^2y,x^3y\}$, if the group is $$D_8 = \langle x,y | x^8 = y^2 = xyxy = 1 \rangle$$ and $y=c$. Although this package is convenient, it is not efficient. With a more efficient code, it should be possible to find all of the non-trivial circuits in $D_{10}$ and maybe $S_4$. 

See the last of this extended answer. I'm going to part company with everyone else and say that you can describe other elements of $\text{Gal}(\mathbb{Q})$. In other words, I claim that you can identity a specific element of $\text{Gal}(\mathbb{Q})$ in a wide range of ways, together with an algorithm to compute the values of that element as a function on $\mathbb{Q}$. You can use either a synthetic model of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, or its model as a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$. Although this is all doable, what's not so clear is whether these explicit elements are interesting. The other two parts of the answer raise interesting issues, but they are moot for the original question. 

There is a specific reason that singular homology with simplices is simpler than singular homology with cubes. You would like the homology of a point to be "trivial" according to the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms. (That is, $H^0 = \mathbb{Z}$ and the others are trivial.) However, if you look carefully at the chain complex of maps from cubes to a point, it is not true. The homology groups have to be corrected by hand by annihilating certain degenerate chains. If instead you carefully use the standard ordered simplex --- not just an abstract simplex floating in space but one with numbered vertices --- then it works automatically. On the other hand, products of chains look a bit simpler at first with cubes. They are only barely simpler though, because of the magic of simplicial sets. So on balance simplices are nicer than cubes. Likewise, at the entirely rigorous level, defining singular homology with "disks" is not really a complete proposal, and not necessarily a simple proposal if you were to flesh it out. Do you mean maps from "all" balls, or some specific collection of balls, or just one standard ball? What is the boundary operator? You can think of singular homology as a conversion from topology to combinatorics, attained by building a simplicial set (which is a generalization of a simplicial complex) from a topological space X, and then taking the simplicial homology of the combinatorial object. There is a specific way to do that with simplices, and an analogue with cubes that gives you a cubical complex. For instance, in the case of simplices, even if you start with a point, you get an infinite-dimensional complex with one simplex in each dimension. Presumably you have in mind bulding some CW complex from a topological space X, and then taking its CW homology. But what do you really want to connect to what? It is also true that once you have a definition of homology, you can use a mapped-in disk to define a cycle or a relative cycle, which is then unique up to homology. But that is not the same as defining homology.
