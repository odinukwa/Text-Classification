To generalise a little, in case the moral of the above isn't clear, we 'prove' that two objects are distinct by providing some property that holds of one but not the other. It's an open question in metaphysics whether distinct objects can share every property (contenders might be the object of 52 cards and the object of the deck, I guess). Within logic, though, if two elements of your domain are distinct but the same predicates hold of them there isn't a way to prove that they are distinct - you could show that rigorously in a quite straightforward way; proof systems for first-order logic use (roughly) the above method for proving inequality. 

As has been said, this is not a philosophical question. However, a few issues off the top of my head: 

Q1: From your experience how can mathematicians deal (or how they usually chose to behave) with this huge mathematical universe and be satisfied from a philosophical point of view? Generally, the same way most people deal with a huge universe; they don't think about the philosophical underpinnings. Almost everyone handles reality perfectly comfortably without confronting questions of whether possible worlds, universals, temporal parts and so on exist, or whether their conception of the world corresponds in a meaningful way with reality. Mathematicians have the structures they work with, and on the whole don't necessarily interrogate their assumptions about in what sense those structures exist and so on. Q2: How can a mathematician interested in the foundation of mathematics be satisfied by an always partial knowledge of the mathematic? I think someone interested in the foundation of mathematics actually has a good reason not to be troubled by their incomplete knowledge of mathematics: they are working towards a theory of the foundations, not what is built above them. Just in the same way a particle physicist concerns themselves with the fundamental constituents of matter and doesn't worry about their inability to predict the flow of chaotic systems, a foundational mathematician has no reason specifically to worry about their inability to solve some complex problem elsewhere in mathematics. 

I do not understand how causation can be fairly asserted to fail (in the 1st paragraph) because of some AIF, because AIF adds to, and so changes, the given previous state. 

1 appears too extreme and unconditional; hypothetically, why can reports of an Event never ? For example, imagine a island where all residents excel in philosophy, always are benevolent and tell the truth. Then their reporting of a miracle CAN overpower? I ask out of curiosity; realistically, I know that reports cannot be this strong and that my imagined island does not exist.

The above does not appear fallacious, and instead appears to lack only a Suppressed Premise, which (when revealed) would validate the argument. What have I neglected? 3 below appears to me as the Suppressed Premise. If I insert 3 between 2 and 4, then the argument above becomes valid, correct? If so, what is fallacious?

I challenge not that natural sciences are synthetic, but only that they are a priori. I exemplify my confusion with universal constants, whose existence (I understand) is a priori. However, how can a person's knowledge of them be a priori? Only some external experience can inform you which rational numbers describe them. For example, every human experiences atmospheric pressure, but you cannot know the unit of standard atmosphere somewhere until you experience some measure of it (eg: a barometer or a report about atmospheric pressure). So your knowledge of natural sciences (eg: atmospheric pressure) must be a posteriori? 

Limited as Google is as a tool for lexical research, the fact that Googling the phrase fails to turn up anything beyond this question suggests it's unique to the author. I don't think they've used it as though it's common, though; it's simply a reference to a relatively well-known visual paradigm shift. 

In mathematics there's a type of book, bordering on the textbook but slightly different, that compiles examples to demonstrate the necessity of various conditions on theorems and the correct directions of implication. For example, to show that a connected space need not be path-connected one can construct the topologist's sine curve. My question: are there any similar compilations in the philosophical literature? For instance, in epistemology the obvious set would be the Gettier cases (to show that JTB is an insufficient analysis), along with Armstrong's (?) barn facades and fake towns (to show that context seems to be important) and so on. In ethics we have Nozick's experience machine (the limits of hedonism). Further, potentially-not-site-appropriate question: do people think such a compilation would be in any way valuble in philosophy? 

If something isn't an intelligent entity, the only way it can act towards a goal is if some intelligent entity causes it to. 

Empirically we observe that things in the world seem to act towards goals or purposes despite not being intelligent entities. 

Clarification: I used the term 'counterexamples' since that's the popular term in maths; I mean what I've hinted at in the examples above: a case which establishes a conditions or bounds for a theory. 

As has been pointed out already, if you are using logic to talk about apples and oranges you have already provided some model (say, a is an apple and o is an orange - formally speaking you've set up a function from constants in your logical language to objects or types or fruit or whatever). So I'm reasonably comfortable that the following proof is no less rigorous than what you've got already: let P (a one-place predicate) be assigned the meaning 'needs to be peeled to be eaten'*. Then Po is true and Pa is false, so then clearly ¬(x = y) holds. *obviously if you don't peel your oranges feel free to substitute some other predicate that fits 

It seems to me that Antireductionism cannot be a scientific position as it is in direct conflict with physics which is a part of science(?). Physics makes predictions about things as if they were made of quantum particles. So, if everything is made of quantum particles(?), then the laws of Quantum Field Theory or String Theory would predict something (probabilities) about the future state of the universe given its current state. If this prediction is true(?), then everything is explained by one frame of thinking (Quantum), and there is no need for other "planes" of explanations. Since so many great philosophers have held/are holding this position, I must have made a mistake in reasoning. So, can somebody please explain this aspect of Antireductionism to me? NOTE: The parts of the reasoning that seem a possible suspect to me are marked by (?). 

Does infallible logic even as a concept, imply the existence of God? Is the truth and reality of mathematics inconsistent with materialism? If an entirely mathematical description of the entire universe is possible, does that mean God exists? 

QM predicts odds, but that doesn't mean we are free, right? To be free, we will have to change the odds in our favor, so to speak. Maybe I don't understand probability well, but it seems to me that fixed odds still mean no free will. The laws of QM have been shown (somewhat) to give the same results as Classical Mechanics at macroscopic scales. So all the previous arguments about whether there is free will or not can continue to be valid (I suppose). 

EDIT: Clarification of Question no. 1: If logic is infallible, does it mean that it is more than just a human created thing? That something in the real world makes possible the infallibility of logic? Does it have to originate from a being such as God? Clarification of Question no. 2 and 3: If mathematics is real, it is more than a invention of mankind, ryt? Since it is such a brilliant describer of reality, does it have to originate from God? 

Therefore there must exist some intelligent entity which directs the universe (or everything in it) towards goals, and that entity is God. 

Note that it's not exactly a strong argument, both in terms of logical structure and its empirical claims. 

If an almighty god is some entity which can cause any proposition to be the case, then if such a god existed it would be possible for it to express pi as the ratio of two integers. I would take that to be a pretty strong argument against such an entity existing, but I imagine there have been views to the contrary historically. If an almighty god is some entity which can cause any possible proposition to be the case, then since it is not possible to express pi as the ratio of two integers such an entity would not be able to do so. So yes, the answer relies on what you think an almighty god is. But not in an especially novel or interesting way, in my opinion. 

A good starting point is to figure out the possible arrangements of people and properties, and then draw a table of what they would answer to various questions in each arrangement.after some trial and error you'll develop an intuition for the kind of questions that give you useful results. Note that as posed there are some questions some men can't answer (specifically, neither the truth-teller nor the liar knows what the random-answerer will say in response to any question). I think Boolos describes this as a head-exploding outcome. 

The question is definitely not philosophy, but whatever. I also don't think you're going to get a particularly interesting answer; we spend early childhood being shown a huge array of animals, and we get pretty good at telling when a new object is similar to an animal we've seen before. Most vertebrates have roughly similar structures (eyes, a head, limbs) and textures (fur, feathers, skin) which aren't similar to most non-animals. And there are very clear cases of our failure to recognise life (think of fungi or mould, which we have to be convinced is technically life). As for your specific case, it's a squid grafted onto a mouse walking almost identically to how humans walk; I don't think you should be surprised we see it and assume it's a living thing. 

Then 2 is an AtP because criminal guilt is an independent conclusion and question from emotional misery due to the ticket. 

I have not read Plato's or Socrates's (as reported by Plato) œuvres entirely: so will someone who has, please explicate 1? I agree that some parts cannot be skipped (e.g. those integral for the plot), but other parts can, particularly if you are skipping on, and your reading is guided by, the advice of scholars or teachers who have diagnosed which parts are less crucial?

In 1, how is Bertie objectifying Annie's concern? Suppose that Bertie is ethical. Then Bertie's addressing Annie's concern implies his addressing the cause of Annie's concern; after suggesting dining out, he will ask Annie about, and so address, the cause of her concern. I do not comprehend the distinction between Annie's career vs Annie's concern with her career. 

What does the emboldened phrase intend to say? It feels deliberately phrased vaguely, possibly for tact. That toughness also ought be imputed to pessimism on the significance of death too (as life can be burdensome, if one judges life worthless and aimless)? 

Is it wrong to call the theory that explains all four fundamental forces/interactions a Theory of Everything in philosophy? My views: I think this is not a misnomer, at least not if you are both a physicalist and scientific realist; and I think this is why it was named this in the first place. If you accept physics describes reality and reality is composed of atoms and their interactions, then it is deduced that all that ever happened/happens is a result of these interactions. And Then you have that a Theory of the four forces must also be a Theory of Everything. 

There can be no choice, if events are determined by previous causes. There can be no more than one course of action, if events are completely determined. If your actions are being determined by 'laws', then we cannot claim unimpeded action. 

The way I understood it: While using others, one must respect the humanity in others and remember that they are an end to themselves and not a means to our end alone. My question is: What exact changes is one supposed to bring to the way in which he uses others, given that others are not "mere means"? 

I think that QM does not favor free will, any more than Classical Mechanics does, and here is my reasoning: 

Philosophy has always been extremely hard for me. But here, I am not able to even grasp the definition of a philosophical term. Can someone please explain Compatibilism? 

I believe that logic is infallible, mathematics is true and that an entirely mathematical description of the entire universe is possible. Are these inconsistent with materialism and atheism? Can somebody help me reconcile these? My problems are as follows:
