I would try and find out of the colleague that was upset asked their friend (your peer) to have a word with you. If this is the case, I would just follow up with that colleague and ask "is everything now OK with us, I felt getting X involved was a little unnecessary". Be prepared to listen to their answer though as it may be that they just want to have someone else involved in the detail as safety in numbers/a problem shared is often an approach people take If the colleague did not ask their friend and they initiated this with you without prompting, I would also have a quick word with the upset colleague to make them aware you had a conversation with your peer Either way, the best thing to do is just make sure you can make it clear to the colleague that as far as you are concerned, the matter is dealt with and a line drawn under it. If other people bring this up/request meetings with you to discuss, you need to get your employer involved and aware as this could linger and start to re-awaken, plus it is presumably taking up some of your work time 

I would keep it on your resume if you are proud of the work you did there and wish to highlight this to future employers. Be sure to make clear the dates you were at the organisation and be prepared with answers for any questions that prospective employers who have researched the organisation and have become aware of the investigations will no doubt ask. 

IMHO, one of the most important things in a workplace/career is the ability to understand your environment AS WELL as completing all your assignments and tasks on time. You need to be able to judge an office/workplace and know what is and is not acceptable based on your colleagues, managers, clients. Just being able to do the work will get you so far but understanding your environment is just as important I am in no way saying you just need to blend in, but knowing what is and isnlt acceptable is your responsibility and should be an inate skill. High fiving the person sat next to you when you've just secured a multi million pound sale may be acceptable. High fiving the manager because you just found out he's sleeping with his secretary may not. You probably want to extend your question to give an example of the excitement and childish behaviour 

IN this situation, I would document the issues and downtimes (start time, end time, communication with helpdesk etc, response times) so that you have documented facts to present to your manager. As a contracted helpdesk, there should be SLAs in place and hopefully these are being met. If not, this is also something that your manager should be aware of. This is not "telling tales" but simply putting facts in place to back up perception. I've worked in support functions before and hearing users say "the system is ALWAYS down" is of no use to anyone unless it truly is down 100% of the time. As the helpdesk or application vendor, I'd want this information to be able to spot patterns and assist in some resolution approach. You need this information to have the discussion with your manager. You are essentially doing the work that they will tell you to do so that they can escalate your concerns. You can also discuss with them contingency for deadlines based on the likelihood that the application will be down 

I would remove the cardboard from between the old table and wall in your area and place it on his desk bringing the issue to the forefront. I'm assuming the requests have been polite? Verbal/written? If he has chosen to ignore these and if he isn't your superior/manager, then I would simply place them on his desk forcing him to move them 

You could request a meeting with an HR contact and ask the question directly. You are under no obligation to answer the question "Why do you need to know this information" Hopefully your HR department have discretion built in and will not tell your manager you have asked this question. But again, if your manager then asks you why you asked this, you have no obligation to answer 

I am in the process of moving within my company from a customer support role/department to a new business area. My email address and telephone number remains the same The problem I have is that I am the main support contact for several clients. Despite agreed processes in place, I often get calls and emails from clients directly asking for assistance and advising issues to be resolved. The account manager has not advised the clients that I am moving and I know I will be getting emails/calls after I have moved. He seems reluctant to do so for reasons known only to himself (client confidence, fallout, explaining handover processes etc) Should I just forward all emails directly to the account manager/my old line manager and say "over to you" or should I respond to the client advising them I am no longer working in the support role? The second option feels better to me but is this a little disloyal to my old manager? (Note: I will still have interaction with him in my new role, so there is no concept of bridge burning or not caring, I just want to do the right thing for them AND the client) If advising the client, should I word my email almost in a generic out of office style? "I am no longer in a role dealing with support queries. Please redirect all enquiries to myoldmanager@mycompany.com"? 

Just to follow on from the two excellent answers so far, what hasn't been mentioned is WHAT you are having for lunch There is a difference IMHO between eating a ham sandwich during a meeting and pulling out a bowl of extra spicy curry with some rice and naan breads. I would say that consideration to other meeting attendees is paramount 

It all depends on the role you are applying for - it is always good to have a resume/CV tailored to what you are applying for rather than the concept of a "general resume" that you send out regardless So if you are applying for something in the media, perhaps it would be appropriate to show experience within the sector If you are applying to be an IT developer, completely irrelevant either as a side note or project Surprising your girlfriend in a positive way on a TV show is not, IMHO only, something that a prospective employer would use a gauge for your enthusiasm/positivity 

As a developer, you are UNIT testing the changes to your code. In my opinions (as a developer), that is to check there are no obvious errors, everything compiles, all errors are trapped. You have no way of knowing what scenarios will be encountered once the code goes live (bad data, unexpected input, change in client software, the list is endless) To have 100% confidence that a change will not affect anything, you would need a test environment that mirrors the live environment EXACTLY (data, hardware, permissions, connectivity) and a suite of test scripts that cover every single scenario. This, as is well known, is a virtually impossible environment to create for various reasons If he is expecting 100% confidence, then he needs to provide the environment and manpower to back up his expectations It is a little bit like when project managers and clients ask for stuff to be futureproof! 

** Are you able to have a dialog with your boss to explain your situation? Surely they understand that if they keep you "against your will" for the entire period rather than for a reasonable 4 week period, you will not be productive or co-operative. There is a fine line to not burning your bridges though, especially if you work in a fairly incestious market where you are likely to encounter former colleagues in the future. In my experience, notice periods are there to protect both parties from unforseen circumstances. In reality, an amicable agreement can usually be reached that both parties are happy with. 4 weeks is usually long enough if the handover is managed properly I would also start thinking about how to explain to your future employer if you cannot leave after 4 weeks as they probably do not want to be told the day before you are due to start that they will have to wait another 2 months for you 

It is a fallacy that contractors know everything and that this is reflected in the rates that are paid. I have worked with contractors who ARE exceptionally good and I've worked with ones where it was apparent they knew little. This is also true of permanent staff. The rates being offered and paid reflect the flexibility the company gets and the saving on overheads such as pension, healthcare, holidays that are associated with permanent staff Obviously, interviews for contractors within some companies can be as thorough as those for permanent positions whereas other companies will literally take the first body they are offered as they know they can get rid of them after x weeks/months. The way to think about being a contractor versus a permanent employee when it comes to skill levels is that your renewal is effectively your performance review. If you are doing a good job and the project/budget is still there, you will be renewed, otherwise you will not. The only way to determine if you are capable of getting these jobs is to go for an interview and see if you are offered the role. To answer your final question directly, YES, you are creating an image and it is NOT like this!
