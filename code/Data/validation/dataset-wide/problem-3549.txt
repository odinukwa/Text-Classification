I take it that you feel the changes are quicker for you than in comparison with your friends or peers. You asked, "Is this just my body type?" So the question isn't limited to general principles. If you are seeing unusual results, it could be stress or lack of good lifestyle habits. Do you get enough sleep? Are you under psychological stress? Is your schedule regular? Psychological stress (even something as common as being a student in a challenging major) can increase your levels of catabolic hormones. You also asked, "is there any solution for this?" Yes. Focus on getting lots of rest, managing stress and having a regular schedule. You may see that you don't lose mass as quickly if your stress goes down and your lifestyle improves. 

First, the faq states "gear and gadgets used during exercise" is on-topic. So I am going to ask about the Samsung Galaxy Gear Smartwatch (or similar watches) and I hope that is OK. I would be interested in using a smartwatch as a full featured replacement for carrying my smartphone while running. I don't care about any phone-related functions. I don't even need to listen to music. I only care about tracking my workout in great detail. I want to record my route via GPS, my speed, my heart rate and even my cadence. I use a Zephyr HxM that provides cadence, heart rate, and other data. (I also have a Zephyr BioHarness.) Does anyone know if the capabilities of these new smartwatches that would make it possible to achieve my goals? If so, are there existing running apps that support this scenario? Finally, since the Zephyr HxM provides r-r interval data, does any smartwatch app record this data? Thanks 

General question: why would the upper glute area (piriformis, gluteus minimus, gluteus medius) get disproportionately tight and sore from running? For me, the tightness and soreness in this specific region seems out of proportion to other areas of my body. Nothing else gets this sore or tight. This area gets sore enough that it is the limiting factor in my recovery from longer runs. Following a long run, typically the rest of my body is ready to go again on schedule, while this area has yet to recover completely. Info specific to me: I am not currently doing weight training, but I think my strength is fairly balanced across all the muscle groups involved in running. My glutes have genetic capacity to be one of my stronger body parts; this area has never been my weak area. I am interested in improving my running technique, training methods, mobility or whatever else is required so that I do not over-stress these muscles. If more info is needed, please leave a comment and I'll update the question. UPDATE: 

Response to Mike-DHSc I think you are generally on the right track. I sit a lot, and my sitting posture is not great. I would not be surprised if my hip abductors are lengthened. My hip flexors are shorted, and I have been working on that through Dr. Kelly Starrett's mobility program for a few months (and getting good results). But I have not been addressing lengthened hip abductors. What do you recommend (given that I'm already doing all the stretches you recommended)? Final Update I implemented some hip abductor strengthening exercises and continued the mobility work and the issue has almost entirely gone away. 

Trust me, stay 250-300 above your maintenance level of calories and keep your protein high and you won't gain much fat. This way you will get bigger a lot quicker rather than sitting in a caloric deficit all the time. Also, when you first start working out you can easily build muscle and lose fat at the same time, something referred to as "beginner gains", but after you workout for longer than a year, the way to see more progress is to be above maintenance level in terms of calories. In terms of biceps not getting bigger, I think you should keep doing compound lifts while in a caloric surplus. Compound movements do help your arms get bigger, just keep increasing the weight as you get stronger. Also, including curls can help shape your arms. Lastly, there is a genetic factor that comes into play. Some people have better chest genetics and others have better arm genetics. So if your biceps are lacking and you have tried everything, it could be genetics. 

If you wish to lose weight just eat less. Find out how many calories you need to maintain your current weight and just eat 250-500 calories less than that. If your main goal is to lose weight it doesn't really matter what you eat, but eating healthy is always better. As for dark chocolate I believe it suppresses your appetite, due to the amount of fibre it contains. So it basically helps you stay in a caloric deficit. 

Every person is different in terms of how many calories they burn each day and how fast their metabolism is. 

It all depends on your goals, but since your are skinny fat I would recommend eating less and losing weight first. 1) Start off by eating less and going to the gym. If you wish to build muscle, increase the amount of protein you eat. Since you are a beginner you should be able to burn fat and build muscle at the same time by eating less calories but increasing protein. 2) refer to 1 3) This depends on your goals, but like I said above you can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time if you haven't worked out before. 

People store fat first in different body parts. For example person A could store fat first in their belly and then their face. Person B could store fat first in their face and then their belly, its different for every person. Neglecting metabolism, people who say they eat a lot and don't gain weight are not actually eating enough and vice versa. Best way is to count calories! 

There's no specific angle. Focus on what feels right for you. Since you feel your chest more when doing it at 90 degrees, try to keep it around that. 

That could rather simply be water weight. 1.4 kilos is such a small amount that the weight of your most recent foods and the last time you went to the toilet could cause that sort of fluctuation. Get back into lifting when you can (do upper body and core) and keep at it, you're doing fine. If you continue to lose alot of weight then you might need to try and adjust how much you're eating. 

I will be honest, you will not gain muscle with 3kg dumbbells. They are simply too light. A single push-up will have you moving more than five times that weight. I understand if you can not get a gym membership, but you will be better off with bodyweight workouts until then as they allow you to progress. Your assumption that callisthenics is too easy is unfounded as there are any number of progressions to do to build strength (read the link before for more information from someone more qualified). $URL$ Now, with your assumption in the comment for hamza_tm's answer that you could easily worsen your physique I would say that is very hard. Simply losing fat will improve your physique as it will make all of your muscles appear larger. It also takes an extreme amount of work to overbuild muscle in a specific area, we're talking years of only doing triceps, or only doing core work, for something that to happen. Follow a full body routine and you will be ok. And with your fear of losing too much fat in the wrong areas of the body I would say that you should not worry about that, as nearly any part of your body that you judge to be too skinny can be filled with muscle. $URL$ Both those men are 10 percent bodyfat, but as you can clearly see one has a very high muscle mass, where as one has very little. This idea that fitness is extremely hard is one sold by the fitness industry to sell products and supplements. Choose a premade plan and follow it consistently and you will see results. Now while you begin this program I would also advise you using an If It Fits Your Macros calculator(link below) and using it to slowly cut fat. You will be far happier with your body skinny first, and it is much easier to cut before bulking. Use the calculator and lose at the 15 percent option so you still have the energy for bodyweight workouts. $URL$ Keep a food log using either an app like myfitnesspal or a diary and stick to it as best as you can. If you can not always get enough protein, or you eat 20g's too many carbs do not beat yourself up over it or worry. Simply try your best the next day and continue your program. If you maintain both of these things for a few months you will see results. If you follow the program consistently and finish the entire 6 months you will look and feel better. Take a photo log of your progress to encourage yourself and make your change easier to see it. You can do it alright. 

Not sure of the exact name, but many people just call it "tricep stretch" This video explains how to perform the stretch. 

If your main goal is too lose weight then just staying in a caloric deficit of 250-500 calories should be what you aim for. So find out how many calories you need to maintain your current weight here and then just subtract 250-500 from it. This will help you lose weight. For your runs, it depends on what your goals are. Do you want to increase your stamina?, become faster?, etc. But what I would recommend is making a routine and tracking your progress. So I cant really say how often you should do it without more information, but getting enough rest is always important As for building muscle, if you haven't worked out before, you will be able to lose fat and build muscle at the same time. So doing exercise with the dumbbells and other body weight movements would be beneficial. Also remember to get enough protein if you plan to build muscle. 

I recently started a programming job and have notice my shoulders have started to round. I try to sit with good posture but my posture breaks after a certain time and I don't notice it. I workout 5 times a week and follow a good workout plan (includes all compound lifts). Whats some good workout or stretches I can add to fix rounding shoulders? 

Once again the most important thing is staying in a caloric deficit. There was an individual who only ate twinkies and donuts and still lost weight. Stop worrying too much about little things, just focus on eating healthy and not over eating. 

Losing too much weight quickly can be bad for you health, not going to list all the side effects, so its better to do a controlled weight loss. By your description its seems like you are skinny fat, and the only way to correct this is to lose weight. I would recommend adding weight training to your routine for a more aesthetic look. 

There is no way to change your genetic potential. If you wish to get bigger and stronger you should eat more (healthier is better, and protein is important) and workout. If you wish to lose weight you should workout and eat less. Its important to determine how many calories you need each day and then either increase or decrease them to reach your goal. With hard word and proper diet you can reach your genetic potential after 3-4 years of training. If you aren't satisfied with your genetics then steroids would be an option but I would not recommend that. 

Green tea can help aid in weight loss, but the only way to actually lose weight is to stay in a CALORIC DEFICIT - so your body burns more energy than you give it through food. Basically as far as I know, green tea has the ability to burn more calories, so it helps you achieve the caloric deficit easily. As for drinking green tea 4 times a day. I would recommend drinking each cup at the same interval throughout the day for maximum benefits.
