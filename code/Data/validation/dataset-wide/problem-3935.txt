Here are some pointers in the right direction. For 1), I would suggest that you read Peter Scott's classic article on the eight Thurston geometries. The article can be found on his webpage and it includes a highly readable introduction to hyperbolic geometry in the plane, as well as a discussion of orbifolds. Next: Your family $F$ is the family of all simple closed geodesics in $S$. Next you chose a shortest element of $F$. (Note that this really is a choice - there may be a tie for shortest.) Now you choose two points $p,q$ in $\gamma$. Let $X$ be a component of $S - \gamma$. Note that (the closure of) $X$ is homeomorphic to either a twice-punctured disk or a three-times punctured disk. So draw this in the plane. Now prove that there is a simple arc (not necessarily a geodesic!) connecting $p$ to $q$ that is not properly isotopic into the boundary. (Say, using facts about the classification of surfaces, or using what you know about the fundamental group.) Now use what you know about geodesics to "pull the arc tight" to get the desired geodesic arc $c$. Now, if $X$ is a twice-punctured disk then both of the concatenations are parallel into a puncture. So hopefully you took $X$ to be the three-time punctured disk. Again use the classification of surfaces to show that one of the two concatenations is non-trivial (while the other is parallel to a puncture. Finally, pull that concatentation (call it $\omega$) tight to get an element of $F$. So $\ell(\omega) \geq \ell(\gamma)$ because $\gamma$ was shortest. Now, if $\ell(c)$ was less than the lengths of both $\gamma'$ and $\gamma''$ then $\omega$ would have length less than $\gamma$, a contradiction. Pulling tight strictly decreases length in this situation, because $c$ meets $\gamma$ at a definite angle. 

A bubble table, like the one at the Exploratorium. I couldn't quickly find a good link at the Exploratorium website, so check out the list of Google images instead. It would be particularly cool to connect this with a discussion of minimal surfaces. Edit: Just to give more details -- The bubble table at the Exploratorium is a large (4 feet?) and shallow (4 inches?) bath filled with bubble solution, at waist height of a 6 year old. The museum provides metal loops which visitors use to make large tubular bubbles. It is particularly amazing to lift the hoop up and the pull it down over your head: you get a moment of looking out of a bubble. I don't remember if they provide other wire frames. It would be cool to have the standard ones to play with (one-skeleta of Platonic solids) and various saddle inducing frames (say, subgraphs of the one-skeleton of the cube). Also interesting: wire frames of knots (interesting unknots, trefoil, figure eight) shaped to allow seeing their Seifert surfaces. Another suggestion: parallel plates of clear plastic connected by rods, to allow the creation of Steiner networks (or at least their approximation). 

Here is a general discussion, written at a lower level, which may be helpful to you. If you take $S^2 \cross S^1$ and remove four vertical disjoint solid tori $D_i \cross S^1$ then the resulting manifold $M$ has integral homology $H_1(M) = \ZZ^4 = \langle x, y, z, t \rangle$. Here $t$ goes around the fiber and $x, y, z$ lie in the planar surface $P = S^2 - \cup D_i$. Each of $x, y, z$ goes around one of the first three components of $\bdy P$, so the last component of $\bdy P$ lies in the class $-(x + y+ z)$. Note that $\bdy M = \bdy P \cross S^1$ is a union of four tori, $T_i$. So, for example, the first homology of $T_1$ is generated by $x$ and $t$. If we Dehn fill $T_1$ along the slope $a_1/b_1$ that is the same as killing the element $a_1x + b_1t$ in $H_1(T_1)$. Thus the new homology is $\ZZ^4 / \langle a_1x + b_1t \rangle$. If you do four fillings, then you are killing four elements of $\ZZ^4$. It is now a matter of linear algebra to decide if a four-tuple yields a homology sphere. Computing a determinant shows that the filling $((a,1),(b,1),(c,1),(d,1))$ yields an integral homology sphere if and only if $abc + abd + acd + bcd = \pm 1$. For example $(a,b,c,d) = (2,3,5,-1)$ or $(2,3,7,-1)$ give homology spheres. Brute force computer search finds more examples: $(-19, 21, 23, -26)$, $(3, -4, -23, -25)$, $(5, -9, -22, -23)$, $(-5, 6, 13, -23)$, $(-3, 4, 7, -17)$, $(2, -3, -11, -13)$, $(-8, 9, 11, -13)$, $(3, -7, -10, -11)$. 

Yes - surface bundles over the circle are irreducible (*) as long as the fiber is not a two-sphere. This follows from the fact that the universal cover of such a surface bundle is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$ and Proposition 1.6 of Hatcher's three-manifold notes. (*) in the sense of connect sum. EDIT: To answer the question posed by Juan in the comment. A orientation preserving homeomorphism $h$ of $T^2$ is reducible (that is, preserves the isotopy class of some essential multicurve) if and only if $h$ is a power of a Dehn twist or is the power of a Dehn twist followed by the hyperelliptic element. Here is a "cut-and-paste" proof: if $h$ preserves a multicurve then it preserves a curve, say $\alpha$. Now, $h$ either preserves or reverses the orientation of $\alpha$. If the latter case replace $h$ by $h$ followed by the hyperelliptic, to reduce to the former case. Isotope $h$ so that $\alpha$ is fixed pointwise. Note that, as $h$ preserves orientation of $T^2$, the sides of $\alpha$ are preserved as well. Thus $h$ restricts to a homeomorphism of the annulus, fixing the boundary pointwise. By the classification of mapping classes in the annulus, $h$ is a Dehn twist. As a bit of an advertisement: Farb and Margalit have written a primer on the maping class group. You can find a discussion of the mapping class groups of the disk, annulus, and torus in Section 2.4, on the "Alexander Method". (In particular they give the usual proof that the group of orientation oreserving classes on $T^2$ is $SL(2,Z)$. They also give as an exercise the characterization of Dehn twists.) I'll end by pointing out that there is not a contradiction between my answer and Hatcher's. If the monodromy is reducible then the resulting torus bundle is Seifert fibered and in fact has Nil geometry. 

Yes, $K'$ is uniquely determined by $K$ and so, no, a knot cannot be a cable in two different ways. This follows from the Gordon-Luecke theorem and from a result of Feustel and Whitten. See Lemma 5 in this paper of Malyutin. 

This is a result of Lickorish, in his paper "A representation of orientable combinatorial 3-manifolds". The paper is only eleven pages, and is very readable. In his proof, Lickorish rediscovers some ideas first investigated by Max Dehn 40 years earlier. Lickorish's theorem was unexpected at the time; I don't think that Witten's remark is really justified... Here is a very sketchy overview of Lickorish's proof. The first step is to note that every closed, connected, orientable three-manifold $M$ has a Heegaard splitting. That is, you can get $M$ by gluing together a pair of handlebodies. (That this is true for combinatorial manifolds is an easy exercise. That all three-manifolds are combinatorial is a very difficult theorem.) The second step is to prove that any orientation-preserving homeomorphism of a closed surface is isotopic to a product of Dehn twists. This requires proving that you can get from any (non-separating) curve to any other by a chain of curves, with each pair meeting exactly once. The third step is to relate Dehn twists to a special case of Dehn surgeries - this is probably the most "three-dimensional" part of the proof. Since the three-sphere has a Heegaard splitting in every genus, the theorem will follow. Other references include Rolfsen's book (I think) and the book by Prasolov and Sossinsky (definitely). 

Taking their ratio gives a lower bound for width that depends only on $g$. Two questions immediately suggest themselves. (A) Is the double exponential really necessary? Surely it isn't, but I guess you would have to understand the thick part of $Q(S)$ better to prove it... (B) How does this compare to the width of the annulus found by Masur? I believe that you can find explicit estimates in work of Bowditch. Of course those annuli are much, much wider. So why don't they contain wide-ish flat annuli? Presumably because these wide annuli are "expanding" in the language of Kasra Rafi: that is, they are modelled on the geometry of a round annulus in the plane, instead of on the geometry of a right cylinder in three-space. 

$\newcommand{\HH}{\mathbb{H}}$Here is an expansion of what Anton is saying. Suppose that $M$ is a closed hyperbolic three-manifold. It follows that the universal cover of $M$ is $\HH^3$: hyperbolic space. The covering map of $M$ comes with a deck group - namely there is an action of $\pi_1(M)$ on $\HH^3$ so that the quotient $\pi_1(M) \backslash \HH^3$ is homeomorphic to $M$. Now fix a set $S$ of generators for $\pi_1(M)$. Let $\Gamma = \Gamma(M, S)$ be the Cayley graph for $\pi_1(M)$ relative to $S$. Also, fix a point $x$ of $\HH^3$. Let $\rho_x{:}\,\Gamma \to \HH^3$ be the orbit map: namely $\rho_x(g) = g \cdot x$ for vertices of $\Gamma$, and all edges of $\Gamma$ are sent to geodesics. The Å varc-Milnor lemma says that $\rho_x$ is a quasi-isometry. It follows that the Cayley graphs for any pair of closed hyperbolic three-manifolds are quasi-isometric. Thus homeomorphism types cannot be distinguished this way. 

Since the isometry checker returned true in both cases, we are done. Just as a final remark - I found m390 by looking in the cusped census for homology solid tori, with symmetries, with fundamental group of rank at least three (according to SnapPy). The first requirement is because we want to fill to get a homology sphere. The second and the third help the twins appear. 

I am not an expert in this topic. I would guess that "minimality" is required to make anything work. For example, take any system with any labelling (also called a partition, or Markov partition if it satisfies various properties). Take any point $x_0$. Let $x_i$ be the $i$-th iterate of $x_0$. Attach a blob $B_i$ to $x_i$, where all of the $B_i$ are identical. Make a new system where $B_i$ gets sent to $B_{i+1}$ and the points of $B_i$ get the label of $x_i$. Here is a reference for minimality. $URL$
