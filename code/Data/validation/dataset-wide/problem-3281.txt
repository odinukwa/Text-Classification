There is no mystery here at all. Pakistan was a US ally. The US backed India in its conflict with China. Had Pakistan tried anything, the US would have severely penalised it. What changed was Nehru's attitude to Kashmir and the reemergence of Sheikh Abdullah as a political force. It genuinely appeared to many observers that Nehru was preparing for some big concession on the Valley. His death completely changed the political picture in India and the Pakistanis believed they needed to move quickly while the Indians were in disarray. Furthermore, the infamous 'hazratbal incident' had created the impression that the Kashmiris might welcome the Pakistani Army- as a matter of fact, this did not happen. Another political factor usually quoted is the impact of Fatimah Jinnah's campaign in which she accused Ayub of having sold out to the Hindus over the Indus waters. This wasn't true but it showed that America was being viewed by suspicion despite its genuine help to Pakistan. A complicating factor was that Ayub's attempt to modernise Islam with the help of Prof. Fazlur Rahman Malik had stirred up a hornet's nest of sectarian rivalry. Ayub thought that winning a war would make him a 'Ghazi' and give him authority over the Ulema. There were also some military miscalculations and failures of Intelligence. Still, had there been a popular uprising in the Kashmir Valley and also if certain key operations had not been mismanaged, Ayub could have claimed it as a victory. Turning to the Indian side, three factors which no one talks about should be borne in mind 1) appearing to lose calamitously to China was very good for India. It split the indigenous Communists and, unexpectedly, killed off Dravidian separatism. It turned out that Indian Nationalism was a stronger force than had been previously imagined. However, losing to Pakistan would have been an intolerable narcissistic injury. For a start it would have led to ethnic cleaning on a massive scale within India. Secondly, India would have focused on an infantry led assault across the Punjab and Sindh border rendering Lahore uninhabitable. Thus Pakistan would lose more by winning. As it was, the Indians got worried about the 'Siliguri gap' which some loudmouth Pak generals were talking about- thus they welcomed the opportunity to dismember the East Wing- i.e. Bangladesh, though this was a blessing in disguise for Pakistan. 2) The death of Nehru meant that America saw India as potentially coming into the Western Camp on a wholesale basis. Since the regime change in Baghdad and the rise of Nasserism, India had more weight in the Middle East than some General in Pakistan. However, the unexpected death of Lal Bahadur Shastri and divisions withing the Congress 'Syndicate' meant that India could not become a US ally. Post '65, Pakistani diplomats did some pretty nifty footwork- while the Indian diplomats and politicians fell flat on their faces- so that, by the time Nixon was in the White House, America had given up on India and vice versa. Still, America could not commit to Pakistan against India because India simply mattered so much more. Anyway, Indira Gandhi signed a Defence Pact with the Soviets, so there was a limit to what America could do. 3) India, like Ceylon, had intially been distrustful of the Army. However, unlike Bureaucrats, Soldiers have useful skills. Post '62, the new consensus was that the Army should be looked after and insulated from the politicians. This was a sound policy. India developed a professional Army and was less adventurist than its neighbour as a result. '65 was by no means a disaster for Pakistan or, indeed, for Ayub personally. The people of Punjab saw they were vulnerable and supported the men in khaki. Esprit de corps and fighting spirit (josh) tended to increase not fall. Ultimately Ayub came to be seen as standing in the way of reform within the Army. However, it was mass disaffection- in part due to economic progress made under Ayub- which brought him down. However, his successor was worse so it was only after the Bangladesh war that the Pakistani Army started to assume its modern form. 

Britain had agreed to pay for Indian troops if used outside India after the first world war. This meant that it ended the second war with a huge debt to India. Britain wanted India to remain within the Sterling zone- i.e. India would use the pound as its reserve currency- and also honour all pensions and other payments to Britishers. Furthermore, British wanted to safeguard its investments in India. The Indians readily agreed and went the extra mile- because of suspicion of America- by 'buying British' even if the American product was superior. Thus Britain lost nothing financially- rather it gained. However, since the Indians pursued stupid economic policies of the sort popular with the British 'Fabian' Left, longer term, India declined even further in importance. Tiny Hong Kong- which pursued sensible policies- became much more important. Britain had 'over-full' employment after the war. It gained by the repatriation of British managers and civil servants. Interestingly, some returned British officials used their knowledge of Indian languages like Punjabi to bring in Indian workers for the expanding factories in U.K. Ultimately, India's real use to Britain turned out to be as an exporter of labour- both skilled (Doctors) and unskilled! Britain was 'making a profit' on India prior to 1919, and 'breaking even' after that but India's economic stagnation meant that this profit had been declining in importance since the 1840's. 

Except during periods of War or high tension, overland travel via India between the 2 wings was possible. However, after the introduction of a visa and passport requirement in 1952, this became much more expensive and time consuming for most people. Prior to 1955, Pakistanis found travel through India more expensive than it should have been because Pakistan hadn't yet devalued their currency while the Indians insisted on exchanging it at par. Furthermore, the break up of the Indian Railways and the new priorities of both countries meant that the Rail connection was neglected.Thus overland travel was possible but costly and difficult. For commodities, the Govt. enabled the shipping route between West and East Pakistan to be monopolized by a few Karachi based West Pakistanis who charged high prices. Economically, there was a huge drain on the East Wing because Bengali jute had to pay for development of the West wing. The air link, via PIA, after 1956, mainly used by bureaucrats and army officers, was very expensive and often detoured via Colombo rather than flying over Indian territory. This was because the Army realized that they would need PIA in the event of hostilities to air lift soldiers (as in fact happened during the 2 Indo-Pak wars) and thus for strategic reasons a longer route needed to be kept operational. The Indians, whose economy was more dirigiste, worried about smuggling and had little interest or incentive in facilitating overland transport between the 2 wings. However, overland travel was certainly possible except during Wartime or periods of increased tension.
