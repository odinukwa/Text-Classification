You seem to think the options are (1) Follow whatever whim happens to strike you right now. (2) Do what society says you should do. There is another option. Think carefully about what will benefit you and then do it. You say you have read Ayn Rand, but I don't think you could have read her very carefully if you left out that option. You might want to read one of her specifically philosophical books, e.g. - "The Virtue of Selfishness". 

then it is a bad explanation regardless of the specific details of the claim. 9/11 conspiracy theories typically fit this pattern. Bush, or the Mossad, or Wall Street bankers somehow arranged 9/11 or let it happen for some reason like making money, or engaging in a war for oil or something like that. But Bush pretends to be all broken up about it and says he is going to stop the terrorists when really he just wants their oil. Try to ignore the gross stupidity of the alleged motive in this case, and think instead about how Bush would go about arranging 9/11, and what will happen after the event. How can he go about recruiting members of the conspiracy? "Hi. I was wondering if you wanted to participate in the cold blooded murder of thousands of innocent people so I can get some oil." The conspiracy theory says that the conspirators act in public as if they believe their lies. But so do people who are taken in by the alleged conspiracy. So the conspiracy theory doesn't explain the behaviour of anybody. Also, how does the conspiracy theorist know about the conspiracy when everyone acts as though there is no conspiracy? And how do the conspirators stop each other from ratting the others out? And how do they distribute the spoils of their conspiracy? They can't use standard contract law since that would require making the conspiracy public. There are other flaws, but the above are the highlights of the linked article. 

Trivially True Languages work because we construct shared meanings to associate with specific patterns of symbols to form words (syllables for spoken languages, gestures for sign languages, etc.). As such: 

The base position in a scientific endeavour is that we don't assume something to exist (or to have some specific attribute) until we have some reason to think that it does - i.e., evidence to support it. So yes: atheism is both scientific and supported by the current body of evidence. If you can design a proper experiment and collect data that casts doubt on the current atheistic conclusion, go for! Just know that your god-concept will not only have to explain your own experimental results but also the decades of null results. 

As a rough description, sure. I'll assume that the inconsistent results you're referring to are ones that are still inconsistent after all possible sources of error have been ruled out. 

Many people who like to call themselves philosophers do a lot of logic and maths. The vast bulk of this stuff has nothing to do with what used to be called philosophy and it is often wrong. I can't tell you what you should do, but there are some problems you should bear in mind. If you're not interested in doing something you shouldn't do it. Also, it is not necessary to be in academia to do philosophy. You could have a day job doing something else and do philosophy when you're not working. Also, there is a lot of philosophy that is not formally identified as such and it is often a lot better than academic philosophy. Academia is largely hostile to doing good philosophy. The problem is that academics like tests. To pass the test you have to give an answer that satisfies the examiner. The examiner is set up as an authority on what is right and an exam is a terrible way of determining what is right or wrong. You have only a limited number of shots (often only one) to persuade the examiner you are right and then you're toast. Creating substantive knowledge requires a lot of back and forth argument so this is a terrible system for finding truth. So either a given academic philosopher hasn't figured this out, or he has figured this out and thinks it is okay to ignore criticisms of stuff he is doing. Either way he is bad at epistemology. Let's consider the particular case of the mere addition paradox, which is also called the repugnant conclusion: $URL$ The problem runs like this. Assume utilitarianism is true (that moral judgements should be made by looking at how much utility they generate), that utility scales with happiness, that you can add up utility of different people and compare these aggregates between populations. Then if you have a lot of people whose lives are barely worth living this would be better than having fewer people who are very happy, but this sounds wrong - this is the mere addition paradox. Perhaps somebody can come up with some mathematical model in which this conclusion fails, but no such model is necessary because every assumption made in the argument is false. Let's look at the first assumption. Utility is some sort of measure of pleasure or happiness or something like that. If such a measure is calculable then it follows that there is a closed list of stuff that is relevant to morality. This, in turn, implies that there is a bound on the growth of knowledge and that any problems remaining when the maximum amount of knowledge is reached will never be solved. And there will be problems because at a bare minimum there will be issues of whether different parts of our knowledge can be used together and stuff like that. So then those problems will remain unsolved forever no matter what people do. But if that is true then some things about how to do stuff and how the world works can't be understood. And since the stuff that can't be understood is related to stuff that supposedly is understood in fact that the stuff that is supposedly understood also can't be understood. For example, if everything more than billion light years couldn't be understood, then we couldn't understand anything else either. Light from the incomprehensible stuff would interact with the stuff we supposedly do understand and we wouldn't be able to understand the subsequent behaviour of the stuff we allegedly understand. So then the first assumption in the mere addition argument implies that the whole world is incomprehensible the assumption should be rejected. The mere addition argument can't fly without that assumption so it is false. The second assumption is too vague because happiness is a vague idea. People can feel happy for bad reasons and different people may use happiness as a label for different sensations. So we can reject the second assumption too. What about the third assumption? Let's suppose we identify utility as happiness whatever that is. Different stuff can make different people happy and different people are not necessarily talking about the same thing when they talk about happiness, so then you can't place all utility on a single scale and add it up between different people. So the assumption fails. But what if we look at what makes a person's life better in reality? This does not save the assumption. What makes a person's life better is solving problems and different people have different problems with different solutions so you can't put them all on one scale. The fourth assumption has similar problems. Some philosophy stuff worth reading. "The Open Society and Its Enemies" and "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper. "The Fabric of Reality" and "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch. Ayn Rand's novels and collections of essays. The books of Thomas Szasz and William Godwin. See also $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

That said, as a species we've developed a pretty big perception-window that an infinite-being candidate would have to fill! (And if one day we do encounter a being indistinguishable from an actually-infinite one we'll probably have to say 'Close enough. Now what?') 

I think the answer to your question also depends on the definition of 'Falling' as well as the definition of 'Bottomless Pit'. If endless free-fall is your goal, pretty much any ol' orbit will do. You will be constantly falling, but barring a chance collision with an object whose orbit crosses your own at just the right time you would never collide with another solid object. If you want to be falling INTO an identifiable something, rather than simply being in free-fall at any arbitrary point of open space, see Joseph Neathawk's answer regarding black holes. If by 'pit' we mean something with physical walls surrounding the falling object, not just open space or a gravity well, we still have a few other options. One of the things to remember with a question like this is that there is no preferred 'down' in the universe - there's only 'away/towards' some other reference object. 

This seems accurate, although I would say that idealism, without any further specification, does not mean anything more than the view that our thoughts make up fundamental reality. "The idea that we can't possibly observe things-in-themselves directly" is something Kant introduced; not all idealists make this distinction between things-in-themselves and things as they appear to us. 

This is known as Hume's Fork. By his own criterion, shouldn't we reject his own work? It's not any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number, nor is it any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence. It seems as if Hume's Fork is self-refuting. It would surprise me that he didn't notice this himself. Did Hume address this issue? 

The "fallacy fallacy" is that you reject a conclusion because the argument is a fallacy - even though the conclusion may be right. In general form: 

So for human beings to be able to observe galaxies, humans need to 1) exist (to do the observing) and 2) galaxies need to exist (to be observed). If humans can't exist without galaxies, then anything that disrupts galaxy formation will thwart us humans from doing the observing right at that first step. Thus, once we have proved the necessity of galaxies for human existence we can conclude that the cosmological constant must be in the range of values that allow galaxies to form, thanks in part to the weak anthropic principle. 

Ah. Short answer: No, and a solid argument for the opposite. ASSUMPTIONS: First, by secular argument I assume that you mean one that does not include magic - i.e., that relies only on what we know of the physical universe, how it works, and some reasonable extrapolation from there into areas where the results aren't in yet. Second, be aware that you are taking as a given that something called a 'soul' exists. While the nature and properties of 'soul' are not well defined, I will assume for the sake of argument that by 'soul' we can mean 'some core aspect of self'. Third, we must assume that the 'soul' has some effect on/control of our minds/bodies while we are alive in order to meaningfully represent 'us'. This should follow fairly obviously from the second assumption, but it is a critical consideration to keep in mind. Fourth, in order for a soul to carry that core aspect of self into the future postmortem, we must assume the soul pre-death is largely the same as the soul post-death. 

An example of an author who would disagree with me is Jean-Jaques Rousseau. In his Discourse on Science and the Arts (also called the First Discourse), he argues that the arts and sciences are not beneficial to society, but rather add more dependencies and cover up our enslaved state. He was a critic of luxury (which science and the arts make possible), which lead to more inequality, and even argued that it contributed to the corruption of man and moral deterioration. An example of this moral deterioration is that people, who see a scientist, a philosopher, or any other educated man, will try to be like him. In other words, they'll try to be like someone who they are not. They are being dishonest, Rousseau says. The further we push science and the arts, the further we get from who we naturally would be. 

Yes, in exactly the same way that law exists - that is, as a social construct that we human beings have come together to (mostly) agree upon. Declarations of human rights are living documents, in that they are open to interpretation when conflicts arise and are subject to change as we refine the language used to express the ideals behind them. Codes of human rights (or lack thereof) help shape the world, or at least in the places and aspects where humans spend the most time. If you mean 'exists' purely in a physical sense, then no - you'll never be able to pick up a Human Right and chew on it. Human rights are (often codified) ideas, and like other ideas exist in a more abstract manner. At its most basic, the social contract (explicit or implied) that we human beings have with one another implies there is some set of rules we should all follow. There are many different possible social rulesets, many at odds with each other. The concept of human rights forms the basis of one possible ruleset that takes fair treatment of all human beings as a core concept. In other words, human rights exist because we humans created them - in much the same way that art, music and philosophy exist because humans created those, too. 

The word 'selfish' as it is commonly used mashes together two ideas that don't belong together. One of those ideas is being concerned with your own interests. The other is being willing to rip people off, steal, kill, treat people badly and so on. There is no opposition between acting in your own interests and acting morally since it is not in your self interest to abuse others. If somebody doesn't consent to doing something with or for you, then you should be willing to let them go on their way. You might be wrong about what you want to do, or that person might just not be a good person to cooperate with, e.g. - he might be unenthusiastic. See 'The virtue of selfishness' by Ayn Rand As for whether you should have written the code I can't answer that and nor can anyone else. But you might want to consider the following issues. Suppose you write the code and it does some particular task X. Task X might be a special case of some more general thing your friend will want later. Or the code might not handle some corner case. So then your friend might want the code changed and you end up doing more work for free because you set the precedent of doing work for free. In addition, since this is not paying work, you're losing money you could be making every second you spend on his code. So do you sacrifice a lot of time and money to write high quality code, which involves not just writing code, but thinking about what problem you should be solving, how to make the code extensible and so on? Or do you half ass it and write bad code? How much bad code can you write before you corrupt your standards of code quality? Is your friend going to keep wanting your code and keep respecting you and wanting to deal with you if you write bad code? Your default position should be that you don't write code for free. If somebody wants you to write code, then you charge him. If somebody wants you to work for free and you want to continue to deal with him, you should explain the problems with that arrangement, and the broader context I pointed out above. 

The weak anthropic principle essentially states that when we observe the universe, we have 100% probability of observing a universe in which it is possible for humans to exist - because we already know that we do. If the universe is such that it is impossible for humans to exist, we obviously wouldn't be here to do the observing! This is sometimes important to remember when we're observing the universe that we're in - just because it is impossible for humans to observe a universe filled with 'Smergs'1 instead of galaxies doesn't mean that the alternate universe is impossible, just unobservable. Sometimes the answer, unsatisfying as it may be, to the question of 'Why do we observe the universe to be like this?' is that it's impossible for humans, specifically, to be in that different universe. So that said, Lee Smolin's mistake comes in at point #2. Smolin states: 

While it is of course true that the argument given by the proponent is fallacious, his conclusion was correct. The opponent could point at his flawed reasoning, but he could not reject the conclusion based solely on this flawed reasoning. This is an example of the fallacy fallacy or argumentum ad logicam. 

Modern social contract theory is said to begin with Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan (not Rousseau). I will give an overview of the main points in all social contract theories, including the one in Plato's Crito (although technically, it is not a social contract theory!). Note that this is a broad and very brief overview. For a more nuanced view, I recommend the SEP or IEP. Form of modern social contract theories State of nature and its problems (=reasons to have the social contract) They always begin with an hypothetical state of nature. What would happen if there were no laws, no form of government intervening? Ways to resolve these issues (=the social contract) After describing the state of nature, it is clear that there should be an intervening body (=government). For this government to work, the citizens should hand over some of their freedoms to this government. Social contract theories include which freedoms and justification for handing these over (i.e. the role of the government). Plato's Crito and Republic Socrates says in Crito he cannot evade the laws of the city, because they made his life possible. You can't avoid laws when you want to; you were born in a city with laws that gave you protection and possibilities. You also have to accept them when they 'turn against you'. Citizens here, however, can leave the city when they grow up. If you stay however, you must accept the conditions (laws) of that city. So Socrates accepts his death sentence. In the Republic, he outlines his 'state of nature' (though he doesn't call it as such). People would do all sorts of unjust things if they can get away with it (Ring of Gyges). They also want to avoid being treated unjustly and not be able to treat them unjustly back. A just society is one in which these extremes are avoided. Justice is worth having for its own sake (i.e. needs no external justification). The dialogue goes on to justify this view. It is not a social contract theory, because it does not say you give up something to a governing body for certain reasons; you just live a good life because it's worth it by itself. Hobbes' Leviathan (As a side note, Hobbes (and other after him) believe all men are made by nature to be equal. This is very different from the notion in Greek Philosophy, where for instance Aristotle said some people are just meant to be slaves and some people are meant to lead.) During Hobbes' time, religious civil wars were commonplace. It is no surprise then that Hobbes' main goal of the social contract is public safety. Hobbes' state of nature was a place of war of "all against all" (he clearly was influenced by these religious wars). It was the most pessimistic world view of any contract thinker. To resolve this, he proposes a social contract. The citizens sign the social contract, however, the sovereign is not a party of the contract (the citizens can't abandon the contract because the sovereign breaks the rules (compare with Locke!)). You can never resist him; he is the only thing that stands between this state of affairs and the awful State of Nature! For Hobbes', the sovereign is the most powerful man on Earth (even a God on Earth). The title page of the book says "There is no power on earth which can be compared to him". My thoughts: this absolutist point of view may seem extreme nowadays, but consider the religious, civil wars he lived in. He wanted peace and was willing to give up a lot to get it, even if that means giving up your freedom to be ruled by a potentially tyrannical sovereign. A lot of people in the same situation nowadays would agree. Think of the people in the Middle East who prefer Saddam Hussein's (horrible) regime to the unrest of having no real leader, for instance. Locke's Second Treatise on Government Locke's State of Nature is very different from Hobbes'. The State of Nature is not that bad. Contrary to Hobbes' version, it is not a lawless state (there are indeed morals). There is the Law of Nature (which has been given to us by God). We all belong equally to God, we can't take away what is God's, so we shouldn't harm each other. As long as you don't harm others, you are free to do as you please. It is, in other words, a peaceful place. But, conflicts may arise. A property dispute, for instance, and there is no government to intervene. There is no civil authority, so disputes are likely to escalate (instead of being resolved by a third party). This is the main reason for the social contract. For Locke, to goal of the government is to serve the citizens (i.e. those who signed the contract). The sovereign has fiduciary power (we entrusted him with this power); if the sovereign doesn't do this, the citizens can rebel (i.e. abandon the contract). The role of the government is to protect"life, liberty and estate, which I call by the general name of property" (property in Locke is much broader than what it means to us today); to protect our rights which are given to us by the Law of Nature. Rousseau's Social Contract Rousseau has two social contract theories. The first is a descriptive theory, outlined in his Discourse on the Origins of Inequality. The second is a normative theory, outlined in his Social Contract. Rousseau's develops his idea of the State of Nature historically. In the beginning, with few people, everyone was happy on their own. They had few needs which were easily satisfied by nature (an abundance of resources for few people). Since people lived solitary lives, there was no competition, no fear, etc. Since pity is an essential trait of these people, they would not harm each other. But, times change. More people were trying to get by with the same amount of resources, so they had to start living differently. They started living in small communities and divisions of labour were introduced. Living in communities, however, had some nasty side effects: people started comparing themselves with others, which lead to shame, contempt,... It was in this phase that private property came into existence, which led to competition, greed, and inequality. Those who came out best in the competition think it's a good time to start a government to protect their rights. It is supposedly to guarantee that everyone is equal, but in reality it just makes sure the inequalities that benefit those with private property are kept in place. His normative social contract theory is attempt to deal with this state of affairs. His book begins with "Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains"; he clearly wants to offer a solution to resolve this issue. Since the State of Nature is so peaceful, it would be reasonable to expect that he would propose to go back to this state. He does not do this; it would not only be not feasible, but also not desirable, he says. So the question becomes: how can we live together (in a community), but at the same time be free (i.e. avoid the nasty side effects I talked about). This is where he introduces his very controversial concept of the General Will. We submit our own, individual wills to the General Will. This General Will is not just the sum of particular wills; individual persons become a people and this becomes the foundation of society; this is the sovereignty, which, according to Rousseau, is undividable. The General Will is directed towards the common good. This concept has been very controversial, especially when Rousseau said that people who do not comply must be "forced to be free". This all sounds very totalitarian and even gives justification for it. Robespierre was influenced very much by this book and said to lead his Terror regime "in the name of the people"; it was the "will of the people". Rousseau also said the "General Will cannot dwell"; for some, this is even more evidence of his totalitarian viewpoints, for others, it just follows from the definition of the General Will, namely that it is the norm, what reasonable people ought to want.
