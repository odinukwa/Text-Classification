That article doesn't provide references, and so is suspect. Any drug needs to have the effect replicated in multiple independent laboratories to verify efficacy. We do have some experimental evidence that beetroot juice has some cytotoxicity for several tumour lines but the effect is much less than a standard chemotherapeutic drug such as Adriamycin [1]

As they say, the reason is mostly that smaller amounts are washed when handwashing. The average water consumption for 12 place settings is on average 83-121 litres (depending on whether all the plates are washed together or in 2 portions) when washed by hand and 20 litres when machine washed. They do however say that there's a huge spread on how much water is used when washed manually: 

The report is aimed at prices for relocating expatriates. The prices might be different for locals or permanent residents. In the case of Singapore for instance, a big part of the population lives in heavily subsidised public housing, which is not easily available for foreigners. Of course that is a very bad example, as the index of The Economist does not include housing. The index is based on a list of items purchased in every country. This again might be biased, as this assumes a very simplistic argument, that people will use the same goods everywhere on the world. In the case of Singapore for instance, driving is indeed very expensive, but public transport is widely available and used and not very expensive at all. 

No, this is nonsense. I found an article from The New Yorker, which explored that claim. They asked some lift specialists about it: 

This indeed says that the estimated global economic loss of income is between 0.2 and 2.0% for an increase in temperature of 2Â°C. Which is (from the same report) in the high-emission scenario going to be around 2050. It also says however that this is difficult to estimate and that for higher temperature increases, there are few estimates. Now where do the 11% that policies will cost come from? It's from another IPCC report:

TL;DR : No, even if one chooses to interpret the excerpt of the Qur'an as such, the maths don't hold up I am going to base this answer on your second source, as the calculation there is reduced to the minimum which makes it a lot easier to show its flaws. This is an answer on the mathematical aspect of the problem, not covering the interpretation of the quote. 

So while it is probably fair to say, that Singapore is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates buying items corresponding to the index, the report does not let us conclude that it is the most expensive city for the general population. While cost of living is a difficult thing to define and measure, there are other efforts to compare it: 

Assuming this correspond to the distance light will travel in one day, we get a speed of 324'000 km/s which is more than the speed of light (roughly 300'000 km). Using the sidereal day won't help, as this will only make the value bigger. Now in a lot of the calculations they use the synodic month instead (29.53 days). This will indeed decrease the number of months but this effect will be entirely canceled out as this leads to a proportional increase in the orbit circumference. (One cannot define the month with one definition of the orbit and then use another definition of the day to calculate the distance per day. In all three sources they come to the result either by mixing up different definitions of days, orbits and the like and omitting any explanation for it. Or by using overly complicated calculations to an easy problem to hide those errors in a lot of smart looking maths.

There's another problem. One year doesn't have 12 months. The Islamic Calendar Year has 355 days. Considering a month of 27.21 days as mentioned above, 1000 years are equal to 13'019 months. With this we can calculate the distance the moon travels in 1000 years, which is roughly 28'000'000'000 km. 

Yes, a dishwasher almost always uses less water than manual washing. According to a study published by the University of Bonn[1], both the energy and water consumption of a dishwasher is better: 

As this is for only 2 place settings, even the most efficient manual washers are unlikely to achieve the same efficiency in cleaning as a dishwasher. [1] $URL$ 

The answer is probably not. Let's look at where he has his numbers from first. The 2% come from the IPCC report which states: 

And there's some more about it in the article. Of course you could try it out yourself with different lifts, and chances are that some of them will bring you directly up to the floor you want, not because it works but because nobody else wanted to get on. This might then lead you to believe that it works on some lifts, even though it's really just chance. 

Yes, this is true. The 2014 budget allocates $145.8 billion to social security and welfare and $24.2 billion to defense. In the 2013 budget this was $138 billion versus 22$ billion. Of course this is only the budget and not the real expenditures, but considering that there's one order of magnitude of difference between the two budget posts, even massive miscalculations won't make the defense spending go higher than the welfare spending. 

So, modifying the extra-cellular pH around tumors, and also tumor cells intracellular pH are lines of active enquiry in treating cancer at this time.

So, this has shown that IER has health benefits with the need only to fast 2 days a week. Furthermore, fasting insulin and insulin resistance falls were greater in the IER group, though modest in both. If lipid levels are related to risk for dementia, then falls in LDL and total cholesterol were seen in both groups. [1] Johnson JB, Laub DR, John S.

There appears to be some gender differences in responses, so this one to fear was only found in females: [3] 

Also note that most comparisons neglect taxes, which are lower in Singapore (maximum 20%) than for instance in Norway (up to almost 50%). Overall, it is safe to conclude that Singapore is indeed an expensive place to live but by most standards not the most expensive one. 

So the report concludes on a reduction of 3% to 11% in consumption in 2100 or more clearly on a annual consumption growth that it is slightly reduced (0.04 to 0.14 (median:0.06) percentage points). Now, of course comparing a reduction of the consumption rate to a loss of income is comparing apples and oranges. The conclusion that the costs of climate policies are five time highers than the benefits cannot be drawn from those numbers. Other than that there are other aspects why the reasoning is false. For instance it does not take into account the costs of not taking action now will have on the time after 2080, where if no action is taken, the temperature will continue to grow (see the IPCC report). Further information can be found on this article on the Skeptical Science blog with additional sources. 

Wrong. According to NASA, the circumference of the orbit of the moon around Earth is 2'413'402.16 km. Now, how long is a month? A sidereal month is 27.21 days in solar days of 24 h (86'400). Note the definition of a day in the source, which is 86'164 this is also correct, but that's a sidereal day, meaning a day as measured in relation to the positions of the stars and not the sun.
