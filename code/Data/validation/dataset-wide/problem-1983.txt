Short Answer - You still have a chance. Based on the multiple interviews you went through, and them telling you that they were impressed, then I'd say you're still a top contender. They did state, however, that you were the first interviewed. I wouldn't be surprised if it took a couple of months for them to get back to you on the decision. Ultimately, the hiring manager makes the decision - and HR doesn't know when that decision is going to come. The hiring manager may decide to interview a few more candidates whose resumes have impressed them, or interview every candidate that they get a resume on. It's also possible that you are either under-qualified(but impressive) or over-qualified for the position - I don't know your skillset - and they may be interviewing to see if they can find a better fit. If not, you still have a chance at securing the job. Either way, I would suggest sending a hand-written thank you note to the senior members/hiring manager that interviewed you. While sending a card/note to HR is fine, sending one to the hiring manager is going to keep your name in their mind. Also, do not send gifts. Most companies have policies regarding not receiving gifts in these situations. Personal Experience Every company has different hiring processes. For example, the company I'm currently with took nearly 5 months from the initial phone interview, to having a contract that I could sign and officially call me apart of the company. My previous employer only took about 3 weeks from initial interview to signing on. It's different everywhere you go, never count yourself out unless you know for sure you're not getting it. 

I have the same problem. However, based on my area - these recruiters all stem from about the same half dozen firms or so. I usually will keep one good contact with each firm, and if someone else from the firm messages me I will forward them to the good contact that I have at the firm (this shows my, albeit lazy, loyalty towards this particular recruiter). There are a couple of reasons for me doing this. They will build a profile for you, and watch you more closely if you keep in contact with them. This will allow them to see/know your current employment, the length of that employment, and any future promotions you may gain while in contact with them. I let them know that I am currently not looking for a new company to go to. At this point, they will usually ask a question to the point of "What will it take for you to leave?" - I set the expectations really high. Much higher salary then what I'm currently getting, and more senior position. That way, if they do ever contact me with a position meeting this description I know it's going to be an offer I can't refuse. Another, more selfish reason, for staying in contact with a few recruiters is most will take you out to lunch or dinner for free every month or so - and I don't know anyone that doesn't like free food. 

This is not at all uncommon. Avoiding paying unemployment and other benefits is a very common reason for doing so. If an employee quits, they won't have to play those benefits, but if they fire him, they will. In the case of your dad, it's very possible there is an additional reason: Management wants to save face and not destroy company morale: Firing a dedicated and respected employee of 30 years without some very good, well known reason makes management look very bad: Cruel and heartless, unappreciative of their employees, insensitive to their needs - that's not good for anybody. 

You'd need to tell us a good deal more about your present situation to expect a good answer on that. For example: If you're 25 and have been on the job for two years, the answer will be entirely different than if you're 40 and have been on the job for ten years. 

You are in very difficult situation, I agree - "been there, down that", and the end was not pretty. Depending on the structure of the firm you work for, sometimes turning directly to HR can help - that is one of things they are there for: To provide a venue for employees to register complaints and express grievances about abusive workplace situations and potential violations of company policy. Far too often, however, that isn't much of a remedy: HR will be very pleasant and accommodating, pay "lip service" to your complaint, and then file it away and forget about it as soon as you leave the room... If you run into the same sort of disingenuous/evasive behavior at HR as you did with those directly above you in the chain of command, then you're working at a bad firm - try to expedite your exit, as per my conclusion, and @Leigh's answer. Another way of working things, depending on your friends and connections in the firm (as well as its structure) is to skip a level or two - try turning to the manager's manager or someone else "higher up" who knows you and values and respects you and your work as an employee. I have done that a few times, and it worked - for a while... But it's risky - you need to be good at office politics to get it right. Bottom line is that unfortunately, I have to agree with @Leigh's conclusion: Be diligent in your documentation (you seem to be on the right track in that respect) and quietly prepare for an exit - your situation may be approaching toxicity. 

It's also nice to mention that due to it being a startup, you could wager this as being part of your confrontation for having him recognize the criticism. Startups are risky as it is, but it takes a certain level of input and creativity to truly flourish into a blossoming company. Explain to him that everyone's input should be encouraged and options weighed. 

Due to this being a startup, and everyone being on the same level on the playing field, you may want to see how the other team members feel about his expertise. Based on the comments made it seems as though you have a problem with this individual and the advice he gives, but no mention of this being a disruption to any others in the office. Secondly, are you in the role in which you "should" be critiquing him? It may just be that you may be stepping on toes. It's a fair assumption to make that when things like this happen in the office, that the best way to go about solving them is to put yourself in the other's shoes. The above two statements do that. I had one particular colleague at my previous company who acted pretty much this exact same way. It took multiple teams sitting him down in a meeting and explaining to him that, while he was quite knowledgeable and we respected him for his accolades, that he wasn't as Subject Matter Expert in everything and his attitude towards new ideas or ideas that weren't his own was leading to a high tension environment. We basically explained to him that no one liked talking to him and we only did so because he was a coworker. After that he began to work on his behavior, mostly due to peer-pressure (no one likes a whole group of people disliking them). In the end, a year or so after, he's a genuinely nice guy. He still has reserves about meeting new people and still questions everything, but in a much more professional demeanor. So, I'd find out a couple of things: 

After all, you are intern. What do they expect? What can they expect? Are you going to lose your position as an intern because you're an just an intern? That doesn't make much sense to me. 

Risky behavior IMO, because it immediately raises the question: What are you doing now? Why are you going behind the back of your current employer to contact me when I haven't contacted you: It sounds like you're not very loyal or trustworthy... 

Perhaps explain that you are experiencing financial hardship, and since you are doing the work of an analyst and working on the degree, maybe they can make an exception and pay you as an analyst for a stipulated period of time - for example until you can negotiate your financial difficulties (six months or a years, etc) or a reasonable amount of time for you to finish your degree and acquire the official title, so you can be duly compensated without a special exception. Do not ask for a "blanket exception", one that relinquishes you from all responsibility - IMO that doesn't smell right. Also make sure that you are indeed doing the work that demands higher pay, and that you aren't dealing with a perception problem: Doing more than you think you are. You can probably verify this by talking to co-workers, etc. 

As long as that's outside of the workplace, the above applies. However, should it come to your attention, either through your own observation or "through the grapevine" that she is engaging in such behavior in the workplace, then it does become your manager's and HR's business: An employee spreading nasty gossip in the workplace about another employee is unacceptable. The caveat here is should that come to pass, you must make sure that you have solid evidence backing your claims. "My friend from downstairs told me that Ms. X was talking about me" or "I saw Ms. X whispering to her friend and looking towards me in the cafeteria" is not going to be enough. (Secretly recording, on your own, the conversations of another employee may be illegal and/or against company regulations, so you should avoid that.) Your best bet in such a case would probably be to engage your manager if possible - if that's not viable or doesn't help things, your next step is HR. (keep all your personal issues out of it - just say you had some issues with employee X outside of work and she seems to have brought them into workplace, which you believe is unacceptable) Whatever you do, you must line up other reliable employees as allies/good witnesses (not just more gossip and hearsay), should the need arise, otherwise, as others have pointed out, you become the problem as far the firm is concerned - you're bad-mouthing a fellow employee with no basis at all. That makes you the bad employee, not your target.
