Buddha's knowledge or Wisdom which cannot be achieved by his disciples comprises six kinds. They are called the Saya Asadharana Nana. Did the Buddha attain them at the same moment he attained Nibbana? If so, are they part of Nibbana and are they considered as Asankara as well? 

Regretting about your past is only going to make your Karma worse. Best way to deal with past bad memories is to do Vipassana on them. When a past memory comes to your mind, simply note it as a thought about the past. Don't react to it or take it as something that belongs to you. If that memory truly belongs to you, you should be able to stop it from appearing in the mind. But you can't! Because it appears due to causes. So wishing for such thoughts to go away will only create a need in the mind for it to not be present. But that's only going to make you suffer, which is what you are going through right now. The need for such thoughts to go away doesn't stop them from appearing in the mind again. But if you are able to note it as it is, i.e. just a past thought, and not react to it, you can notice that it fades away immediately. If you want peace of mind, you must train your mind to note 3 natures of everything that troubles you: 

Nope! They are exactly the same. There's also 'Maha-Bodhisatta'. That term is specifically used for a being who has gotten the confirmation from a fully enlightened Buddha that he is also going to become a fully enlightened Buddha in the future. ex: Mathree Bodhisatva who is in Tāvatiṃsa heaven at present will become the Maithree Buddha in the future. He will be the 5th and the final Buddha to appear before the world ends. 

Only the third kind of knowledge leads one to freedom from suffering. One can never attain enlightenment by thinking up theories. 

Each of the Javana Cittas are Karmically potent. They come into fruitions at different times. 1. Immediately effective kamma (dittha-dhamma-vedaniya kamma) 

Getting angry is certainly wrong. If this is the first time it has happened to you in that restaurant, a verbal complaint would've been enough. Waiter apologizing and replacing the ice-cream is a clear indication that he took it seriously. Written complaints are usually used for intentional errors or when they don't take you seriously after complaining. To deal with your sadness, do Vedananupassana: Note the sadness as sad... sad... sad... To deal with regret, do Cittanupassana & Dhammanupassana: thinking... thinking... regretting... regretting... 

No, you can't make any choices when you are in Bhavanga state. The Bhavanga process should first be interrupted by one of the sense doors. Volition comes much later in the process. A complete thought process, occurring through the physical sense doors, is made up of seventeen thought moments (citta kha.na). These are: 

There's no voodoo in Buddhism. Buddha preached his doctrine to help you get rid of hatred, greed and ignorance. Any curse or black magic is not a part of Buddhism, even if the lady ignorantly uses a Buddha statue for it. She only harms herself by being ignorant and disrespectful towards the Buddha. 

Katatta Kamma are usually the Kamma done in past lives. So if #1,#2,#3 are missing, Katatta Kamma will get a chance to result in the next birth. But that is highly unlikely as animals mostly have habitual and proximate Kammas. So the chances are that they will keep sinking lower. But once you get into the Niraya, you probably won't be creating any new significant Kamma. Because you will be in a constant state of agony throughout the lifespan. 

I assume you mean "what fetters are eliminated". You cannot decipher the eradication of fetters by any physical feeling. You are not supposed to give meanings to any feelings. You are only supposed to note them as they rise and fall. When the fetters are eliminated, you will know because they no longer arise in the mind. Here's a related answer. 

Citta, Cetasika, Rupa, Nibbana are the four ultimate realities. Everything else is just conventional or conceptual truths. When you see the moon, it's basically the eyes sensing the secondary rupa called Vanna. There's no moon in the ultimate reality. Moon is just what the mind fabricates when rupa meets the eyes. There's consistency because human senses are similar. Other animals see things differently compared to humans. Imagine what the world would look like if we had microscopic eyes. Saying all phenomena are mind made is similar to saying that all pottery is made by a potter. Pottery is just clay in reality. But the potter(mind) shapes the clay into different objects. When you start dreaming, it is not Rupa that is perceived by the mind. It's another thought or a memory perceived by the mind. So it is a fabrication of a fabrication. That has a higher chance of being inconsistent. But it is not unlikely that 2 people dream of the same object in the same way. And it is not unlikely that 2 people see the same object differently even when the senses are similar. One person might see a beautiful woman, but a meditative monk might see her as a skeleton: 

The failure of your marriage could be due to a past bad Kamma you have done. But it is also a result of you giving the chance for that past bad kamma to come into fruition. There are 4 factors affecting the results of past Kamma. Payoga Sampatti is one of them. It means skillfulness, diligence and intelligence. You can use this to avoid the results of certain past bad Kamma. You probably could have avoided such a heartbreak had you at least got to know her as a friend for about an year and studied her character. Even in proposals, you can do that, after both families agree. You didn't have to marry her immediately. You should stop focusing on the girl who left and use your Payoga Sampatti to do a better job in the future when selecting partners. Focusing on her will likely create hatred in your mind and make your situation worse. If she has done wrong, she will suffer for it in the future. But your situation will not improve whether she suffers or not. She could be enjoying life now because of her past good Kamma, her own Payoga Sampatti and Upadi(good looks) Sampatti. In case of the old man, one is born into a low caste because of the following reasons: 

The question is based on an invalid framework! There was no 'him' in the first place. When the cause of the future arising of the 5 aggregates has been eliminated, there will be no more arising. 

But make sure you do not fall into the extreme of eternalism - believing that a person goes from life to live or taking the mental stream of thoughts as a soul. 

The 5th precept is not about addictions. It is referring to taking substances that lead to heedlessness, whether you get addicted to it or not. Love/sexual misbehavior is covered under the 3rd precept. Again, it's not about addiction. The intoxication discussed under the 5th precept is chemically muddling your senses. Especially the mind. Ignorance plays a role in wanting to do that. Once you are intoxicated, it leads to more ignorant acts.
