Personally I'd look for something that uses a rubber strap to hold it onto the handlebar, loose enough that you can move it to point up and down, but tight enough to stay stable when moved. Adjusting the Philips ball and socket to work that way, instead of setting aim once and then tightening to lock, could be tricky. 

There's a variety of guides, reviews, etc. at $URL$ (Much of it in German, so you might need to feed it though Google Translate.) 

Another option would be to very carefully cut off the piece of metal that crimps the existing hose onto the threaded part, and then reuse the threaded part by crimping the new hose onto it. The downside is that if it doesn't work, you can no longer even go on as you are, because you will no longer have any of the old hose left at all to join to. If you can find another hose that fits first, like maybe a one from a similar age frame pump (which would be too short to just use as is), that would be safer. Yet another option (which could also be used if you try the option above and it fails) - pick one of the adapters that came with the new hose, and make the pump fit it, either by tapping it out to a larger thread that fits a larger adapter thread, or tapping it out to a larger thread and fitting a helicoil. Downside - if the new thread is too much larger, the base of the pump will break. (And if it's not larger enough, it won't hold the new adapter securely. You could cross thread it and then use epoxy, but that's getting pretty desperate.) 

You seem to be assuming that "power has to be transferred to the bearings". That is not the case. There is no "interlock". All that needs to happen is that the crank spindle can spin with low friction. As you pointed out, the inside of the bearings is smooth and so is the spindle. I guess it's possible that they slip relative to each other, but so what -- the spindle/crank still rotates, the chainring rotates, and power is transferred from the pedals to the crank arms to the chainring to the chain to the rear wheel. In practice, the friction between the spindle and the inside of the bearing is probably greater than the friction between the inside of the bearing and the outside of the bearing, and therefore the bearing spins. I assume this is the case because the bearing is designed to have low friction, while the spindle inside the bearing is basically like a shaft inside a bushing (a cylindrical hole), which has more friction than a bearing; otherwise we would not use bearings. 

Philips Saferide came with a ball and socket mount. The light has been discontinued though. Possibly you can get replacement mounts and adapt them: Philips page for holder. 

Answers so far seem to concentrate on floor pumps, but what I haven't seen recently is a full length frame pump that uses a hose connector. But 20+ years ago, that was fairly standard. I'd recommend getting a floor pump for regularly keeping tyres topped up, but you still need a pump to take on the bike in case of a flat. If you want an old style pump, Google finds me the Zefal Lapize, but a couple of reviews are unenthusiastic, and suggest that the retro style is the only real reason to consider it. In a more compact style, the Topeak RaceRocket has a hose connection that fits both main valve types. Topeak also make some "mini-floor" style compact pumps with hoses, the Morph range. For pumps without a hose : 

Another way to do this is to use a vacuum cleaner and feed a piece of cotton or light thread through, with the vacuum sucking it out the other hole. Once you've got that through, you can pull the wire through, or possibly a stronger thread/cord/line first. 

If the shoes seem a little too big, try some insoles. Start with the inexpensive ones you can find in a drugstore for $10. That will keep your foot from moving around inside the shoe without having to tighten the straps/laces so much. And maybe the extra cushion provided by the insoles will make the shoes feel a little more comfortable. 

I've found that slick tires can lead to unpleasant surprises on loose surfaces, such as a thin layer of gravel on top of hardpack. So I'd recommend a cyclocross tire with a decent tread pattern (a bit like a mtn bike tire). I used to have Clement Crusader PDX tires on my cyclocross bike. I liked them because they were 37mm wide, even though they are labelled 33mm. The extra width doesn't slow you down, but it makes the ride more comfortable, plus it works better on loose gravel. These days I ride that bike mostly on the road, so I've switched to 35mm Schwalbe Kojak tires for now. If I'm riding entirely on asphalt, then there's no point in having knobby tires. 

While you probably could cold set it, the Sturmey-Archer XRF-8 is available in a version with 120mm OLN dimension. (And you almost certainly can fit a modern bottom bracket. Worst case, have the existing threads removed and fit a threadless bracket. Bottom bracket size guide.) 

Even where there is considerable evidence of dangerous driving, it can be ignored: $URL$ The Crown Prosecution Service guidance often appears to be flagrantly ignored. Some police forces have a policy of ignoring all reports where the driver was merely endangering a cyclist and didn't actually cause injury this time. For much more on the subject, see $URL$ 

You could try hammering your wrench, see photo 4b of $URL$ (or search for "Cheat 3:") Or, as it also says, a longer cheater bar if your tool allows (see the photo above the "Cheat"s, though that's the tool for internal cartridge brackets). Either way, try and make sure that the tool can't slip off the bracket (e.g. use a bolt though the bracket holding large washers overlapping the tool), and that even if it does, your knuckles won't hit anything. (When you say "wrench", you are using a tool designed for the bracket cup, not a pipe wrench or similar, yes?) But yes, there's a good chance LBS will have stronger tools if you can't shift it. 

I feel bad asking this question because I've been doing bicycle maintenance for over 20 years and this seems like a noob question. I was unable to find a Shimano manual to answer this question. I just bought a Norco Threshold CX bike with Shimano Ultegra SL-RS685 brake/shift levers. I want to adjust the cable length for the front derailleur to fine-tune the derailleur position. The cable is routed inside the frame and there is no barrel adjuster to be found anywhere. I looked under the brake hood and did not see anything that appeared to be involved in adjusting the cable length. Obviously I could adjust the cable length at the derailleur, by loosening the bolt, moving the cable a tiny bit, and tightening the bolt again. But it seems difficult to do fine adjustment that way. In case you're wondering why I'm adjusting the derailleur on a brand new bike: The front derailleur wasn't shifting properly because the rear fender (installed by bike store) interfered with it. Before I figured that out, I thought the cable length needed adjusting, and I couldn't figure out how to do it. Techically I can leave the cable alone for now, but eventually it will need adjusting and I would like to know how to do that.
