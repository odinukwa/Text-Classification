We are currently looking at archiving emails and revamping our retention policy. The big question is (for the legal department), how far back do we want to save? Currently our users have a huge mailbox limit, and in the past have all been able to archive as they saw fit. So we have a couple hundred GB of data that isn't in the Exchange Database, but that we'd probably end up sucking into an Archive database for discovery. What I'd like to do is be able to quantify for the legal team how much that would be if we went back 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, etc. I found a fairly straightforward Powershell Script at TheDailyAdmin that does what I want for the most part, but it lumps it all in one pile. I'd like to be able to see the results but sorted by user to know that Sally has 47MB that is older than 2 years, Charles has 190MB over 2 years old, etc. Here is the script I've ran: 

On NPS, under NPS (Local) > Accounting, I see "Configure Accounting", is it that straight forward?? Is there anything else needing done for accounting to be sent to the host 10.10.4.25? It looks way too straight forward. Thanks for your input. 

This may be more than what you're looking to do, but here's how we use RDP for remote users who aren't using VPN. We recently started using the RD Gateway Manager with Remote Desktop Services, a role in Windows 2008. We have it setup to go through our TMG server and directly to a users machine. It uses NLA as mentioned above. The user connecting has to be a member of the right AD group, and a member of the right local group to be allowed access. Depending on how you want it setup, you can connect via a webpage which basiclly opens up mstsc and inputs the proxy setting for the RD Gateway, or you can set the settings on your machine manually so that each time you open it it attempts to go through that proxy. So far it has worked quite well and seems to be secure. 

I'm in the process of setting up a server. Dell PE R510, 6 450GB HD. It came with all drives RAID 5'd, I'm wanting to wipe the configuration and set 0 and 1 as RAID 1, then 2-5 as RAID 5. When I go to setup RAID 1, it's asking me about which Caching Policy to use - Read/Write, Write only, Read only, and none. I'm not sure which to pick here...suggestions? This server will be used for Exchange 2010 and the RAID 1 drives will be used for the OS and Logs, and the server will be on a battery backup. Thanks in advance. 

Thanks for your help above. What you suggested worked fine for me in part, but I had some other formatting issues that I ended up figuring out as well. Just to help the next person looking I'm posting my end result/configuration as well. It may not be as efficient as it could be but it seems to work for what I wanted! Thanks again! 

On the phone screen I click Next. It says USB connection is detected, I click Skip (only option is Skip or Menu). It asks me for my extension or phone number. I put the number in that is assigned to me on the Lync Server (I set it to 5551212 and verified in AD that the number I put in is the same as the msRTCSIP-Line field. I click Next, then enter my PIN (I also reset my PIN to make sure it was valid). I click Sign in, it says "Contacting time server" for a bit, then "Connecting to Lync Server" for just a split second, then quickly an error flashes that says "Account used is not authorized, please contact your support team". Afterward it goes to the screen saying "An account matching this phone number cannot be found. Please contact your support team." I see looking at the menu/system information on the phone that it grabbed an IP address from the DHCP server (and verify it is shown in leases), the mask and GW/DNS are all set correctly. I did notice VLAN ID is set to 1...which we don't use, but I don't see a way to change that to the VLAN ID we do use on our network (if that is even relevant?). I can't access the phone via the web or ping it, but my computer can use the built-in switch to work through it just fine. On the Lync server I have ran the test command - 

We currently use Bitlocker on our laptops here at work. The helpdesk are responsible for backing the Bitlocker key up to AD when they build the system. We ran into an issue recently where a user had a hardware problem that set Bitlocker off, so it won't go past the screen prompting for the recovery key. No problem, we have had this before, except that when I look in AD there's no key, which means somebody forgot to back it up. So I randomly click on a handful of other laptop objects and find another not backed up. So this has me thinking we need to seriously look into this before it happens again (on a higher profile employee). Instead of going through the entire laptop OU and clicking on the Bitlocker recovery tab, is there a way in PowerShell to check that tab and see if anything is in there? I wouldn't even need to know the key there, just to know if any data is there which would show it's been backed up. If not it's not the end of the world, but I'd much rather be able to do that with a script than manually. :) I've been looking online but so far found nothing exactly what I want, usually it's much more complex than I'm needing. Thanks for any help you can give! 

I've been slowly working on a script that will do everything I normally do for a new employee when they start. So far it all seems to be fine except one thing. Here's what I have: Loads Quest snap-in. Prompts for specific information for the user. Gets information about a current similar employee for reference and pipes it into the new employee, minus the specific information I'm prompting for. Creates the AD account. Gets group information of current employee and put the new user in the same groups. Loads Exchange credentials and mail-enables the new user. Goes to the File server and creates their home drive and gives specific rights as needed. All works fine, except that when the new user is created, I can't login as them until I have went into ADUC and reset their password, unchecked "User must change password at next logon". It all looks fine, all the fields are populated, but when I go to OWA to test login, it says bad username and/or password. I've tried telling the script to manually uncheck the box, reset the password, disable, re-enable the account, etc. The commands execute just fine, no errors, but it seems like none of that works. But, if I right click on the user, select reset password, type in a password and uncheck the box, then I can immediately logon afterward. So, it seems like there's another setting somewhere that I'm missing with the script that is happening when I do it manually. Here is the command I'm using to try and replicate what I'm doing manually: 

I've read that it's fairly normal to have several ARP requests per second on the network, but was curious if someone could elaborate on the "why" I would have so many versus not? Over the course of 4 seconds I see about 40 arp requests, right about 10 per second, and all reqeusts seem to be from valid IPs on our network with a known server or PC. Is that many normal? If so, what is the purpose? I've never thought much of it thinking that since it wasn't several hundred a second it was "ok", but my boss recently looked at network monitor and saw them and said that at his previous job they didn't have that many requests, and the network was much larger than ours currently is. So I was just hoping someone could explain to me a bit more about this and if it's anything I should be concerend about or check more deeply into. I definitely want to avoid any network congestion that I can, to allow the network to run as smoothly as possible. Thanks in advance. 

We currently use Public Folders with Exchange 2010. We have a series of shared calendars throughout the organization. Some of the items posted require us to set up devices (video conferencing for example) at a certain time, but the end users who schedule these appointments aren't always the best at letting us know when it is (even though it's supposed to be several days in advance/notice). Other than the obvious way of just going out to those individual calendars multiple times a day to look, is there a way to have Exchange (or powershell, Outlook, etc) alert us via email when an event has been created? For instance if Powershell could go to the Public Folder database, search for any entries added within the last 12 hours, then email me to let me know. Even if I could set it to run once a day, each morning at 7.30 am, that would be a huge help. Thoughts? Thanks!
