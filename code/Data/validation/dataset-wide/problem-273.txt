Edit: Loren Pechtel's figures are right, I was mistaking kt for t. Tens of thousands of kg of TNT per kg of bomb, rather than hundreds. (This actually makes the conventional-explosive variety of Orion less plausible.) 

The answer is in the question, really. Assuming that the physical composition of Venus is Earthlike, it's unlikely that you'll find a radically different kind of life (different chemical building blocks or whatnot). With that in mind, unless the cloud cover is a recent phenomenon, the temperatures would also have to be Earthlike. Ice Ages do not generally lend themselves to the continued survival of a population, particularly if they're global in scope. You could potentially fiddle with the composition of the clouds to allow them to be effectively transparent to non-visible spectrum (for us) light, still allowing a great deal of solar radiation to strike and heat the planet, provide power for photosynthesis, etc. Unfortunately, you might run into a problem there; if life on Venus adapted to better utilize the wavelengths passing through their cloud cover, it would be much less of a visual obstacle to them than it would be to us. The impact of that would probably depend on how important the hiding of the outside world is to the Venusians. 

The Short Answer No. In the realm of scientific realism, there are no chemicals that are simultaneously so sensitive to light that it would trigger an exothermic reaction strong enough to burn a "person" to "death", while stable enough that they could otherwise be carried about by that person. The Longer Answer On the other hand, you already have zombies. Assuming they're actual "dead former people now walking and doing things", your scientific credibility is already in sharp decline. So if it's something you really want as a characteristic of your zombies, you could make it happen. Let's say that your Z-parasite, your microorganism/parasite/magic that makes the zombies, was originally created to organically generate binary fuel for something. It keeps that fuel in the space formerly reserved for its victim's brain, separated by a (for an equally contrived reason) extremely photosensitive but otherwise impermeable membrane. Expose the holes in that "zombie's" head to light, the membrane degrades, a bit of the fuel components touch one another, and whoosh. 

Given the technological constraints of 1910's-1950's, and that war would have evolved from a set of decisive battles on a single field (ala Azincourt) to a series of fronts (ala WW I +), the easiest way is simple: Spin. Run a massive PR campaign. The hero is selected and sent to an unspecified 'front line' location (unspecified for Operational Security reasons, of course). Given the spread out nature of the war, the Hero is always "over there", and the population would be relying on news reports, press releases and propaganda to give them their information - so give it to them: 

By building of the societal implications and urges present in normal society, and bringing them in-line with the existing structures. It would simply be approached in a similar manner as recruitment for the armed forces/police etc. The want civil minded/patriotic/reliable people to help defend their nation/way of life/love of pineapples. Just because the subjects have super-powers, they are still raised as part of normal society. They might have a sense of civic duty, a desire to be a part of something greater than themselves for the greater good. They may even buy into the "with great power comes great responsibility", or they might just do it for the solid pay, accommodation and meals that army life provides. The presence of their super-powers just means they'll be fast-tracked for a specialist position (in much the same way that defence forces have SSO's for example). Opinion: I don't see how this would be any different than for 'normal' people. The fact that they have undefined super-powers is largely irrelevant. 

What you are describing sounds more like territorial clashes/border raiding than war. War has a purpose - annihilation, conquest, resources, whatever it may be, it's a concentrated military endeavour undertaken for a specific purpose. It's an all or nothing thing, and usually a successful war is a short war, with clearly defined objectives, as they are rather taxing on resources (manpower, materiel etc) - and any successful campaign relies on maintain or increasing your resources while denying them to your opponent. Instead of war between the two nations, have you considered the idea of disputed territories - a kind of borderland area between the two nations. Or perhaps have factions within each nation constantly at war - think medieval England and Scotland - most often the skirmishes would be between clans/houses raiding each other. Trade continues between the two nations themselves, but there's constant fighting between some factions. Otherwise, your only other realistic course is, as others have mentioned, some kind of black market/smuggling operations. Or, alternatively, an enterprising third nation acts as a middle-man/distribution centre and makes a tidy profit in the meantime. 

As a different option, what about ultra-long-haul submarines? Nuclear submarines' propulsion is effectively unlimited (at least within the lifetime of the submarine), but they are limited by their ship's stores. So if you had several decks devoted to hydro/aquaponics to supplement what could be harvested from the ocean, you could have a submarine that could potentially operate for years without a resupply, and on which the operators could continue to eat healthy meals. This would, by necessity, need a lot more space, and would be more like a roving habitat than a battleship. 

Given your current constraints... Almost certainly not The most important constraint here is #9. Assuming technology equivalent to 1000AD on Earth, 2 or 3 children surviving to the age of reproductive viability is well below replacement fertility levels. Add to that population loss from war, accidents, and the individuals who simply do not reproduce, and your population will likely go extinct over the interval, not expand. 

You could probably get a little better yield-per-mass from your nuclear weapons with boosted fission designs, but I stuck with pure fission weapons because that's what they were working with in 1966 when they were designing Orion. Just because nukes were off the table didn't mean that rocketry scientists weren't up to trying everything; if a conventional-explosive bomb-driven rocket were actually in any way more efficient or cheaper, you can bet that they'd already have them in action. They aren't... so they aren't. Pursuant to #2, I recommend giving Ignition! by John D. Clark a read. When I say rocket scientists (and rocket chemists in particular) were up to trying everything, I mean everything. It was nuts. And it's a great read! 

Yes. With the right combination of technological advances and materials, it could probably be done. The ship wouldn't move very quickly, though. Which leads us to the problems: 

But, as Shalveny states in their answer, generally names/titles are derived from the power source and the method in learning/developing. At the end of the day, it is your world and you get final say, but generally speaking it's commonly broken down along four main lines in popular fiction: Divine magic: i.e. magic either imbued as a direct result of appeal to a divine being (prayers, wardings etc) and used by religious bodies and agents (clerics, priests, magisters, acolytes etc) Arcane magic: magic that is not associated with any particular god or diety. Most commonly used by magicians/wizards/sorcerers etc and often depends on the strength of the wielder. Elemental/Natural Magic: Magic that is natural in source, often describe as maintaining the balance of life and guarding the natural world. Often straddling the border between Divine and Arcane. Users are most often depicted as Druids/shaman Ritual magic: Power is drawn through the completion of rituals - sigil, ceremonies, relics. Takes time to complete, and can often involve a sacrifice of some description. Shamans, cultists etc are often portrayed performing ritual magic, generally speaking doesn't necessarily require innate magical abilities and is very often used by the antagonists/big bads. 

Fallout 4 has an organization similar to what you are asking about. The Railway Faction, in game, is an underground organisation that protects and relocates escaped synths - they communicate the dead drops and signs, operate in cells and basically run interference for synths escaping from the Institute. If you want an actual transition though, from thugs and petty criminals to thugs and criminals with ideals, then there are a number of ways it could be achieved. The first is to make the change over time, slowly, so that it soon becomes accepted. Rules and regulations are put in place on who can and can't be targeted, and transgressions are dealt with severely. A change of leadership is also commonplace in heading towards a new direction. Another, is to create a secret society within the secret society, so that a select few (say the upper echelons) are aware of the true purpose and utilize the existing structures to get the end result. 

Partially yes, though doing it today would probably be hard. The problems here are threefold: No male gamete donors This may not be a problem. Viable bi-maternal embryos have been created in a variety of species at this point. The fact that both the gametes would be coming from the same parent is another problem, namely... Genetic Bottleneck Parthenogenesis doesn't tend to work for sexed creatures, even when artificially induced, because of imprinting locations in our genetic sequences. We're big into recombination, because it gives us additional avenues for beneficial mutation and recombination, without reinforcing negative traits. Potentially, you could use CRISPR to modify the genes in one of the manipulated gametes or eggs to increase heterozygosity. This is strictly experimental right now, though, and would be unlikely to produce viable offspring in this "one chance or you'll miss it" preservation of the species unless a desperate effort were made. Cloning potentially buys you some time here. Artificial Womb This is probably wholly unnecessary. While a Thylacine is part of a largely-extinct family, as long as its reproductive characteristics are sufficiently close to an extant mammal, a surrogacy could probably be maintained. Summary So, if this were to happen today, the species would probably be done for, though genetic samples could be preserved for cloning/recombination at a later date. We're very close, however, technologically, to being able to recover the species from a single specimen. The one caveat - no male specimens, until and unless we figure out how to manufacture a Y-chromosome from whole cloth. We could potentially find a close relative and do some substantial genetic engineering on its gametes, but that is not something we're close to being able to do right now. 

I can't recall reading your other answers, so please forgive if this has been covered elsewhere, but there are a couple of possibilities, the first that spring to my mind are how each is 'cast'. 1) Direct Divine intervention requires some form of request/prayer (i.e. "[insert name of god], in thy name [please do xxxx]") 2) There is a direct visual effect (i.e. a golden halo/glow appearing around the caster, the gods/spirits symbol appearing briefly) 3) Divine intervention/spells are only available to the truly faithful or devout, and may need some form of holy symbol to use as a focus (i.e. crucifix etc) 4) Magic requires the use of spell components and incantations. Material items that are used as to cast the spell but are consumed in the process (I think this used to be a requirement in D&D - too many years since I played it), whereas Divine magic doesn't. 5) Possibly, the divine intervention can only occur if the 'caster' is possessed by the God/Spirit that could leave a visually noticeable imprint on the caster, literally becoming a vessel of the divine will - eyes glowing, tattoos appearing that kind of thing. 

The Hero is a figurehead, a symbol, there solely to inspire people. It's no longer about tradition and warfare, it's political. It's less about the Hero BEING heroic as much as it is about the Hero now APPEARING heroic. 

Security would be handled much the same as in any other type of undulating terrain. Also, bear in mind that a desert isn't just rolling sand dunes, a lot of desert is flat, dry terrain. Dry watercourses, sparse scrub. Dunes are often uninhabited, and, one would imagine, if doing a royal tour the Queen and entourage wouldn't be seeing the whole lot, but more moving from oasis to settlement along the peripheries, hence solving a lot of the water problem. Anyway, back to the security detail. While the group is moving, there would, I imagine, be the standard scouts and outriders. I would have the 36 guardsmen split into squads of 12. The first 12 ride in front of the Queen, the second 12 behind. The last 12 are your scouts and flankers. 3 front, 3 rear and 3 down each side spread out so that they are far enough from the party to intercept, but close enough to be in regular contact. The Queen and Crown Prince ride with the advisors/protectors in the middle. If possible, one or two of them would be scrying ahead/around for any danger as they move along (not sure how magic works in your world), and others would be ready to defend the Queen while others focus on eliminating any attackers. Once camp is struck, similar protocol. The units of Soldiers take shifts with picket/sentry duty, as do the advisors. Tight security measures would insist on random patrol routes and the camp being cold - campfires can be seen a long way away in open terrain, and they kill your night vision like you would not believe. Hiding in sand is also problematic for any would be assassins/ambushers. Sand dunes are notoriously unstable, and more than likely to bury any would be assailant. It's the reason why you don't dig into sand dunes at the beach - they collapse. If they do manage to successfully hide themselves, then they would need extricate themselves quickly enough to maintain surprise. And they'd have to hide themselves along the main travel routes, possibly for days, places where, most likely, the vigilance of the guard would pay off. Horses could also prove problematic for any hidden assailants, as they spook easily and would balk at stepping anywhere where someone is hiding. Turning it around, if I was going to attack the Queen and her retinue, I'd do it like this: Attack the camp in the middle of the night, halfway between mid-night and dawn, with a primarily mounted group. There are two main objectives: 1) Scatter the horses 2) Burn and destroy as much of the camp as possible Infiltrators on foot cut the picket lines for the horses, a large group of mounted warriors ride through the sentries and camp, scattering the defenders, killing what they can and setting fire to the tents and stores before moving through and scattering the horses. In the confusion, kidnap the primary target, then leave quickly. Strike fast and withdraw. This leaves the defenders scattered and demoralised, with no reliable transport and low on supplies. As far as tracking them in the desert, if it's a large group, then they have to stay close to water. Having someone knowledgeable about the terrain, landmarks and available water would help immensely. Work our where the nearest water is that can accommodate such a group and head there. The more stable the terrain, the more likely there are to be tracks. 

TimBII said it in his comment, but I'll go ahead and make it an answer: No If you turn a sentient biological creature into programmable matter, you're not going to have a sentient biological creature anymore. Even assuming you could "prime" the user's atomic/molecular structure to become programmable matter at the push of a button without yet doing so, when you push that button, the user will cease to exist. I should also point out that if you can transform normal organic molecules into programmable matter, you don't really need to - you can just rearrange the user's molecules directly. Of course, in so doing, you will kill them, but Star Trek is alright with that. So, you could have your shape-shifting watch. It transforms the user's matter into some other form which is not the user for a given duration, then restores the user's matter into its previous state. The user will not be conscious (and will in fact, be dead) for the duration of this transformation, but it's a very effective disguise. Your power source, as was also commented upon, is implausible, but as long as you're not too tied to reality, you can hand-wave the energy requirements with zero-point energy or something similar. The remaining problem would be the ethical and philosophical conundra that this would create. Did the user die, or simply briefly cease to exist and then resume existing? Are souls real, and do they stick around when the user is not themselves? If your watch can record your complete state right before it transforms you, can that be duplicated on another piece of appropriate-mass matter? If so, is that new construct also you? These are all interesting things to consider, but you won't have a conscious-in-another-form shapeshifter as a result of your watch. Edit: There are also enormous problems with both "scanning" the target matter (ie. your user) to a level of definition that includes whatever states are relevant to allow you to reconstruct them after the fact, and rearranging their matter in a rapid fashion that isn't horrifically destructive to everything in their vicinity. But again, we let Star Trek get away with it.
