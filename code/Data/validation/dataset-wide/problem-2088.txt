Yes, if that is your wish, then your boss should respect that. Your boss might be the one who pay you and give you orders, but they are not really obliged to simply burst in to anyone's office just like that. Even if he\she can see you trough the window, and it might seem you are available, that might still not be the case. You could be writing an important mail, a mail where the content needs to be accurate. You can argue that a knock on the door will disturb the "flow" of mind at that point, and while this would be up to each individual, at least having the chance of finishing that one detail before letting people start a conversation, might help keep the peace of mind. I know for a fact, working in closed office too, that the difference between one who knocks, and one who just burst in, is quite different. Those who knock are polite and quite when allowed to enter, and those who burst in usually don't give a damn if you are busy. Even if I am obviously in the phone! You have the right of peace and quiet when working in an office like you do, your boss should know that. While privacy is generally not something you need or can expect at work, peace when working and general respect from your coworkers is. This is, in the end, more a matter of respect. 

What I learned about interviews is that you try to sell yourself to the company. To hire someone is a huge risk, as it's not just your paycheck that is a cost attached to you, but also thing like equipment, traveling (if the jobs requires that), training and all that. If they hire the wrong person, they can end up paying for someone who either does not know what they are doing, or simply don't do anything at all. As mentioned, it is an advantage for you, provided you use it. If they reveal something about what they do or need, and you fit it, shoot that info in. "Yes, I can do that! I can fill that role!". But also prove you actually can. If you claim to be good with computers, but actually just know how to surf facebook, you are worth nothing. But, if you say you do your own maintenance, have knowledge regarding many common software solutions and so on, you are suddenly at a greater state. Of course, do not lie or push the boundaries. Be careful tho, it could be a trick. If you just sit there and barely say anything, it might just show them that you are nothing but a bobhead figure that just want to get things over with. Those who hold the interview are the costumers, you are the salesman, trying to convince them why YOUR wares are the best ones. 

People have answered about why the accepted wisdom is good, and they are valid points but you also asked 

I'd recommend look at this book Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware It explains that your brain has two modes of operation. One is a linear mode, which is fairly slow. This is what you are currently concentrating on and actively thinking about. There is also a huge amount of background, asynchronous, processing that goes on. While you are focusing hard, or trying to focus hard on something, you are slowing down this background processing. If you do something else, you free up the brain to ponder things in a non linear way. Having a break can help you to complete your tasks. Personally I would say a high percentage of big problems I solve are while I am not coding and doing something unrelated. Suddenly I would realize that the approach I was taking was not great and a small refactor would make it all so much better. So don't feel bad if you are not coding, your brain is still working on things. But be mindful that you still have to actually do the work. 

I think you are in a good position but you may have slightly the wrong mindset. You are not an employee and as such you don't have job security in the same way you would have (or not have) if you were employed. You are a contractor who has a good relationship with a client. You can and even should ask them about what work is in the pipeline. A good relationship goes both ways so they will want to keep you on if they can. However, this is not always possible as often external resources, like yourself, are not financially viable in the longer term. What you can do is be proactive about the situation: 

But for you this can be a huge opportunity. You are just out of college with few commitments you can have a big impact into the success of this startup. 

It sounds like you are in a horrible situation, and you should never have to do such things. You sound like you are quite deliberately non-managerial. if you don't have a chance to move this may make it a bit easier for you. It is also worth you trying to find someone higher up the chain to talk to, even if you have never seen them in person. Your manager's behavior is not just hurting you and the team you are in but the company itself. If products don't get shipped profits drop and shareholders get unhappy. Thinking about it in a general rather than a personal nature may help you to make the step, you are not just helping yourself but the whole company. 

In short, any reference is (usually) a good reference. I've never really heard about a company writing a negative reference, instead of writing none at all. The only exception, as mentioned, is any reference where family (or friends) is involved in a significant way, such as working at your fathers workshop, or in your mothers flower shop. A reference is more to show who you are, so if you've been on time, tidy, kind to customers, respecting coworkers and been actively taking part in various tasks, you're already in a good position. General knowledge about what you work with will usually be expected, but it's rare to just enter a work space and instantly mastering its rules. Something that is perfectly accepted one place, might be frowned upon somewhere else. So yes, use your references, it's better than going blank. In the end, the worst thing that can happen is to get a 'no', and it's not uncommon knowledge that one will have to work for that one 'yes'. 

Might differ depending on country/state, but everything created for your company, or while at work, is usually (by law even) the property of your company. As an example, if you work for Microsoft, and come up with some brilliant idea to "revolutionize" how windows operates, you do not own the idea, Microsoft does. The recognition comes internally, either by colleagues or even your boss patting you on the back (preferably both, I guess). There is a positive side to doing it this way anyway. The boss and company has the responsibility to handle the products and decide if ideas are good or not. If they find an idea to be good, but that same idea ends up being hated by consumers, it's the boss\company that take the hit, not the individual who came up with the idea to begin with. 

Depending on where you are located, you can, by law, deny any picture that includes you be kept away or taken down from the net. Exception is images that are pure crowd (think football stadium) where you happen to be visible + some others, but generally public crowd scenarios. Now, pointing at the law will likely make you look like a "tinfoil hat" person, and at the same time dent your group relationship. A simple way is to decline from being part of the picture, but offer yourself to be the one taking the picture. You can further add that they can add your name to the people present at the event (a name is quite meaningless without a face in therms of photos). I see your reasoning, not wishing to have your information spread across the galaxy, but I can assure you, if you are already not using sites like facebook and google+, or any other site where you "need" to add personal information, it's highly unlikely that your information will even be usable for any big company. A simple name connected to a job without any details beyond that, is useless, it tells nothing about who and\or what you are. Companies are usually more interested in your information for add revenue anyway. If they have no idea about your interests, location nor personal detail, you are useless to them. So if no such information is out there, you should be quite safe. 

This answer assumes you are being unpaid during your internship, you imply this in your question but are not explicit about it. Company A is exploiting you. There is a culture that seems to have grown that people can be asked to work for nothing to gain skills and the possibility of future work. You are providing value to the company and not being compensated. I have no idea how or even if this is legal but it is exploitation all the same. So given this, I would suggest you forget about how well known company A is. They do not sound like a reputable employer. They are using their 'fame' as a means to exploit workers. Company B have shown they value you and your skill set and are not seeking to exploit you. They seem deserving of your time and efforts. 

There is another possibility: That while the team were happy hiring you their decision was overruled. Often hiring decisions stay within the local team before getting a final sign off from higher up. It does seem to fit the evidence. It was not just yourself that spent a lot of time, the company did as well. They would not do this if they were not seriously interested. It sounds like it was the final authorisation that caused the issue. I've seen it from the other side, where I have interviewed a good candidate for a role where there was supposed to be a job and to be told that it was not possible to hire them. It is unlikely that the company would let on if this was the case, to say 'we have no budget', or 'we have a hiring freeze' or 'the sales team blew the budget on their team building trip to Venice' is not something they would say to somebody in your position. While it is disappointing it does happen. 

Precariously balance a very expensive looking (but in reality cheap) vase or some other ornament on the corner of your desk. It is important that it looks: 

If you are lucky enough to not to have to worry financially and you are fairly confident that you can freelance if need be, I think taking some time off for a break is a great idea. Why? 1. R&R Job searches can be hard work, especially if you have a demanding job. Taking some time to yourself can be great for you, it can give you some time to decompress and evaluate what you want to do next. 2. Travel Related to R&R but there are some trips that can't be easily done while working where you get a limited amount of holiday time. Long trips and experiencing other cultures can also be great for you personally, giving you a fresh perspective on your life. 3. Training There may be some skills that you would like to learn or brush up on, this can be hard when you are working full time. You can spend time on a formal or informal course to give you a chance to learn things that will be advantageous when looking for a new job. 4. Community work This could be open source work, or something local where your experience can be useful. Again this is a good thing to talk about when interviewing and can be good to give you insight into yourself. 5. Flexibility You kind of mentioned this, but it is worth reiterating when you start to look for work you can be flexible about when and where you interview and you can also be more flexible about start dates and locations, which will not hurt your prospects. 6. Networking You don't specify your field, but you may find there are events you can go to, conferences or such like, where you can network, talk about jobs and get to know more people in your field. If your current employers won't give you time for this you will be able to go on your own time (and cost). This can be a great springboard to freelancing or to another permanent position. 7. Assertiveness When you are interviewing you will be able to use points 2-6 above to show that you are a confident go-getting individual who is not afraid to step out of the norm to improve themselves. This is in many cases seen as a good thing and can reflect well on your prospects. So, of course, there are risks involved in jumping ship without a plan, and these should be seriously considered. But it is far from all downside, used correctly it can also benefit you greatly. 

You must remember that you will always be you. You can try to change your views, but to drastically and you may end up just hurting yourself. Unless you are designated to be in control of a department, it's not your job to keep it "clean". Just avoid trouble and you usually end up fine. Sacrifices meant to better your career is a double edged sword. You need to make sacrifices to succeed, the question is what you want to sacrifice, and if you do the right ones. 

Easy, if your old job is similar to the new one, and maybe even close in a geographical setting, your previous boss and potential new boss MAY know each other. Slim chance, but it's a trap you DON'T want to step in. Besides, you'd want some papers from your old boss, to show your new, and likely they will end up talking on phone regarding you. Lastly, as mentioned, you don't want to seem like the asshole. Not like your new boss can know if your old boss actually was a douche, or it was you who were the douche all along. In short: If you badmouth your previous boss, you only badmouth yourself. 

Yes, that's the idea. It's in fact not that uncommon. How much they can change will depend a bit on what else the contract states. Most likely this is to open up for changes that are required in the future. It's not like you'll sign a new contract if you're promoted, thus also given more\different tasks. This requires changes that would possibly go against points in contract, thus requiring new or changed contract. 

Working within IT, where sub departments work with different tasks, I can relate to this completely, and the answer I've got for you is this: Be honest, and provide all the information you can. There is no real way to avoid pissing of some people, there will always be those who just won't accept any answer not equal to what they wanted, and there is always those who try to play you by making you feel guilty or stupid. As long as you keep your cool and provide all the information you can in an honest way, you are doing your part. There is no shame sending them to other people you think can answer a subject better, that's how work synergy should be. Your job is primarily to send them in the right direction, a little detour here and there is bound to happen at times, so never feel bad for that.
