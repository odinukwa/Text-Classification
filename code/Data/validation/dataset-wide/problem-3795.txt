Also in Israel, Euclidean geometry is taught in schools for quite some time (judging from my parents, me, and my children). I personally like the idea of it being taught and being the first encounter with mathematical axioms, definitions and proofs, as well as an encounter with geometrical thinking. For learning what a mathematical proof is, I doubt if any of the suggested substitutes will even come close. But it is not clear to me how crucial it is to teach (everybody) the notion of a mathematical proof in high school at all. 

Mirror symmetry gives some remarkable connections between certain varieties. The first step in this connection is that certain homology groups have the same rank. An explicit case for mirror symmetry duals is the case coming from toric varieties. In this case, the dual objects comes from duality of polytopes. So duality of polytopes: associating the octahedron to the cube and the icosahederon to the dodecahederon is related to Mirror symmetry. Perhaps the very first facts about polytopes which demonstrates unexpected equalities for certain homologies can be described as follows: For 2-dimensional polytopes this is the following numerical fact: A polygon has the same number of edges as the dual. (Well, this is not so unexpected.) For 4 dimensional polytope P it is the following numerical fact. Start with a 4-polytope with n vertices and e edges. Triangulate every 2-face by non crossing diagonals. Let $e^+$ be the number of edges including the added diagonals. Consider the quantity $$\gamma (P) = e^+ - 4n . $$ It is true that for every dual pair of 4-polytopes $P$ and $P^*$, $$\gamma (P^*)=\gamma(P).$$ This is more surprising. For example, let P be the 4-dimensional cross polytope and Q be the 4-dimensional cube. P has 8 bertices 24 edges and all the 2-faces are triangles so $\gamma (P)=24~-~4\cdot 8~=~-8$. The 4-cube Q has 16 vertices, and 32 edges and it has also 24 2-faces which are squares, so $e^+(Q)=56$. $\gamma (Q)=56-64 = -8$. Voila! This reflects some properties of toric varieties (unexpected equalities between Hodge numbers) which express (sort of the 0-th step of) mirror symmetry. Related papers: V. Batyrev and L. Borisov, Mirror duality and string-theoretic Hodge numbers; V. Batyrev and B. Nill, Combinatorial aspect of mirror symmetry. Here is a lecture by B. Nill. 

The Graph-Minor Theorem. A graph $H$ is a minor of a graph $G$ if it can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of deletion and contraction edges. Roberton and Seymour's graph-minor theorem asserts that in every infinite sequence of graphs $G_1,G_2,\dots$ there is $i<j$ such that $G_i$ is a minor of $G_j$. Equivalently it asserts that every minor-closed family of graphs (examples: planar graphs) can be defined by a finite list of forbidden minors (for the example a theorem of Wegner asserts that the list is $\{K_5,K_{3,3}\}$). The theorem was proved by Robertson and Seymour around 1984. The proof spans 20 papers (published between 1984 and 2004) and is very hard, in spite of some simplifications of some of its ingredients. 

While the group of permutations (and permutation matrices) is probably too fundamental to be included, a mysterious, with much more yet to be understood generalization called alternating sign matrices are important in modern combinatorics. Those are square matrices with entries 1, 0 and -1 so that the non zero entries in each row and column alternate in sign and sum up tp one. There is a simple correspondence between alternating sign matrices and monotone triangles. 

this is a great question and fairly good answers are known for arbitrary dimensions. (I think there are works for $d=3$ but I am not sure.) The relevant papers are On lattice polytopes having interior lattice points, by J.M. Wills; J. Zaks; M.A. Perles . Elemente der Mathematik (1982) Volume: 37, page 44-45 (lower bounds) and Bounds for lattice polytopes containing a fixed number of interior points by JC Lagarias, GM Ziegler - Canad. J. Math, 1991‏ (upper bounds) Here are the lower bounds, $n$ is the number of points in the interior. ($v$ is the function.) 

Let me add a few more links. A paper by Ariel Rubinstein entitled "John Nash the master of economic modeling" and a document based on a seminar entitled: "The work of John Nash in Game theory." This includes the following quote from an earlier paper by Aumann. Nash equilibrium is probably the main reason for the "game-theoretic revolution" in theoretical economics. 

Here is Harvey Friedman's take on the question (presented here with his kind permission). "From my point of view, it is foundations of mathematics that is by far the most interesting - not mathematical logic or philosophical logic. This is where the real progress is being made that is of general intellectual interest. I know that this doesn't answer your question, but it does indicate where my interests lie." To my request Harvey briefly explained his distinction between "Foundation of mathematics," "mathematical logic" and "philosophical logic". "1) Foundations of Mathematics. Here the "practice of mathematics" (mathematical practice) is regarded as an object of study, without questioning its "correctness", "validity", etcetera. Mathematical practice is treated as a phenomenon to be modeled - not an activity to be questioned. A crude model of mathematical practice is the ZFC system. Finer models are given by fragments of ZFC. There have been startling discoveries, starting with Goedel. Advances are judged according to how much insight is gained about mathematical practice. The future is huge, as there are all sorts of aspects of mathematical practice that at present have not been properly modeled or only partly modeled - but hold promise for deeper modeling. E.g., classification, simplicity, naturalness. 2) Mathematical Logic. This is a branch of mathematics that investigates the various fundamental mathematical structures emanating out of Foundations of Mathematics - for their own sake. There is no aim to address issues in Foundations of Mathematics. A subarea of Mathematical Logic is clarifying: there has been some reasonably successful attempts to apply these investigations to problems and contexts in mathematics, creating a useful mathematical tool. The most common name for this is Applied Model Theory. 3) Philosophical Logic. This attempts to analyze and treat logical notions in their most rudimentary form, independently of how they are used in mathematics. Mathematics, like everything else, is something to be questioned, justified, criticized, etc. I have not worked in this, because I do not sense realistic prospects for spectacular findings - or at least, the realistic prospects are much higher in 1. Foundations of Mathematics is between mathematics and philosophy, and has a different perspective than either of the two. " 

Here is a useful supplement and references to the existing answers. I asked Yuval Peres a few days ago the question formulated as follows: 

Is a title of a remarkable recent paper by Vigleik Angeltveit and Brendan D. McKay. More than 20 years ago McKay and Radziszowski proved that $R(5,5) \le 49$ and in this paper they showed that $R(4,5)=25$. 

Amos Altshuler studied a related notion in his Ph. D. thesis and the paper "Altshuler, Amos Manifolds in stacked $4$-polytopes. J. Combinatorial Theory Ser. A 10 1971 198--239." In his version he allows manifolds and not only spheres and demand that the manifold contains every edge. (He consider simplicial 4-polytopes but thos can be realized as simplicial complexes in 3-space.) I think I saw some subsequent papers on similar notions of "hamiltonian manifolds and spheres" but I could not track them. (I think this is Schulz ' paper) Other related papers (still not those I thought about) Effenberger, Felix; Kühnel, Wolfgang, Hamiltonian submanifolds of regular polytopes. Discrete Comput. Geom. 43 (2010), 242--262. Schulz, C.: Polyhedral manifolds on polytopes, Proc. Conf. Palermo 1993. Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo (2) Suppl. 35, 291--298 (1993) The Mathscinet review by David Walkup reads: M is said to be a “good” manifold in L if L is a simplicial complex, M is a subcomplex of L containing all the edges of L, and |M| is a closed 2-manifold. The case when |L| is a 3-sphere, especially if L is the boundary complex of a simplicial 4-polytope, is of interest. A “stack” is defined inductively as follows: A 4-simplex with its faces is a stack, and the union of two stacks is a stack if their intersection is the closure of a common 3-simplex. If K is a stack, then |K| is a 4-ball, the boundary complex Bd(K) is well-defined, and Bd(K) can be realized as the boundary complex of a simplicial 4-polytope. Any good manifold in a stack K must lie entirely in Bd(K). A “star” is a stack obtained by stacking a 4-simplex on each of the five 3-faces of a central 4- simplex. Theorem 7: If K is a star, then there are exactly 6 good manifolds in Bd(K), each is a torus, and all 6 imbeddings are isomorphic. Theorem 14: For any n >= 1 there is a stack K of 6n 4-simplices which can be obtained by stacking together n stars so that Bd(K) contains a good manifold of genus n. Conversely, Theorems 16 and 4: If M is a good manifold of genus n in a stack K, then K must be the result of stacking together exactly n stars. Other theorems characterize those ways of stacking stars so that the result admits a good manifold. Theorem 23: The maximum number of different good manifolds in K as K ranges over all stacks with 6n 4- simplices is 6, 8, 12, 24, 40, 80, or 2n according as n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or n >= 7. Theorem 26: For every g >= 1 there exists a 3-sphere which cannot be realized as the boundary of a stack but does contain a good manifold of genus g. Many other nice results and fruitful ideas are developed. The MR for Schulz paper: The author gives a survey on polyhedral manifolds which are contained in the boundary complex of convex polytopes. Manifolds with certain extremal properties (e.g. minimal number of vertices) are of particular interest. Another fruitful field is Hamiltonian $2$-manifolds (i.e. $2$-manifolds containing the $1$-skeleton of the polytope). The author gives a wealth of material by several authors from Möbius, Coxeter, Ringel, Jungerman to Altshuler, Brehm, Bokowski, Kühnel, McMullen, Schulz and others.
