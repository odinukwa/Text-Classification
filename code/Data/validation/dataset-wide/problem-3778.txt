The obvious generalization is false: Consider $A=\begin{pmatrix} 1+x &y \\y & 1-x \end{pmatrix}$ which is a linear matrix polynomial. It defines a compact set in the plane, namely the unit disc. The algebra $\mathbb{R}[A]$ of all polynomial expressions in $A$ is contained in $\mathbb{R}(x,y)[A]$ which is a two dimensional $\mathbb{R}(x,y)$-vector space since $A^2=2A+x^2+y^2-1$. Therefore $\mathbb{R}[A]$ can not contain all of these three $\mathbb{R}(x,y)$-linear independent matrices: $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$, $\begin{pmatrix}2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $\begin{pmatrix}2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ which are all positive definite on the unit disc. Edit: So Handelman's statement is the following: If the linear forms $l_1, \ldots, l_r$ define a compact set and if the polynomial $f$ is strictly positive on this set, then $f$ can be expressed as a sum of products of $l_1, \ldots, l_r$ with positive coefficients. Now replace "(linear) polynomials" by "(linear) matrix polynomials" and you get a generalization to matrix polynomials which is false. The matrix $A$ plays hereby the role of $l_1, \ldots, l_r$. 

Let $X$ be a projective variety over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$ and let $f: X \to \mathbb{P}^d$ be a $k$-morphism. Can we always find an embedding $i: X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^N$ such that the morphism $g=f \circ i^{-1}: i(X) \to \mathbb{P}^d$ is given by $g(x)=(g_0(x): \ldots : g_d(x))$ for all $x \in i(X) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^N$ where $g_0, \ldots, g_d$ are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree in $N$ variables and coefficients in $k$? 

Let $A$ and $B$ be two square matrices with complex entries. Let $\lambda_1, \ldots, ,\lambda_n$ be the Eigenvalues of $A$ and $\mu_1, \ldots, ,\mu_m$ be the Eigenvalues of $B$. Then the Eigenvalues of the Kronecker product are exactly the products $\lambda_i \cdot \mu_j$. Is there an analogue for the sums of Eigenvalues? My precise question is the following: For given natural numbers $m$ and $n$ are there polynomials $f_{rs} \in \mathbb{C}[x_{ij},y_{kl}: \, 1 \leq i,j \leq m, \, 1 \leq k,l \leq n]$ such that for every $n \times n$ matrix $A$ and every $m \times m$ matrix $B$ the Eigenvalues of the matrix $C=(f_{rs}(A,B))_{1 \leq r,s \leq mn}$ are exactly the sums of an Eigenvalue of $A$ and an Eigenvalue of $B$? Here $f_{rs}(A,B)$ stands for the complex number obtained by substituting $x_{ij}$ by the $(i,j)$th entry of $A$ and $y_{ij}$ by the $(i,j)$th entry of $B$. I am aware of some similar construction where the matrix $C$ has the desired Eigenvalues among others. But for me it is important that they are no other Eigenvalues. 

Let $X$ be a smooth and irreducible projective variety over $\mathbb{R}$ of dimension two. I am looking for an instance of such a variety where two distinct connected components of $X(\mathbb{R})$ are homeomorphic to the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$. Does someone know how to construct such a surface? This is of course trivial if we don't want $X$ to be irreducible, since then we can just take the disjoint union of two projective planes. 

For all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n$ let $x^\alpha=x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots x_n^{\alpha_n}$. Let $$\ell^2=\{z=(z_\alpha)_{\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n}:\, z_{\alpha} \in \mathbb{R}, \,\, \|z\|^2=\sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n } z_{\alpha}^2 < \infty\}.$$ Let $1 \geq \epsilon>0$ be arbitrary small. Is the $\mathbb{R}$-span of the set $\{(x^\alpha)_{\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n}: x \in (0,\epsilon)^n\}$ dense in $\ell^2$? I would guess that should be known, does somebody know a reference? 

This follows from Bertini's Theorem: see for example here. Note that your variety does not need to be projective. Let $\overline{k}$ be the algebraic closure of $k$. You know that there is an open dense subset of hyperplanes in $(\mathbb{P}_{\overline{k}}^n)^*$ such that the intersection with your variety does not add new singularities. Since the $k$-rational points of $(\mathbb{P}_{\overline{k}}^n)^*$ are dense, there is also a hyperplane defined over $k$. 

Can I find a smooth curve $C \subseteq Y$ with $y \in C$ such that $f^{-1}(C)$ is again a smooth curve? If not, can I find a curve $C \subseteq Y$ such that $y$ is a smooth point of $C$ and such that every $x \in f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is a smooth point of $f^{-1}(C)$? Can I find a curve $C \subseteq Y$ with the property of 1. or 2. with the additional property that $f$ is unramified along a Zariski dense subset of $f^{-1}(C)$? 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with linear forms $a_{ij} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_p]_1$ as entries. Let $I$ be the ideal generated by the maximal minors of $A$. Is $k[x_1, \ldots, x_p]/I$ a Cohen-Macaulay ring? If no, does the additional assumption that $I$ is a radical (or prime or any other nice property) ideal help? If yes, is there a good reference for that? 

Let $K$ be a field. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $\mathbb{P}^n_K$ whose scheme theoretic support is a reduced, closed subscheme $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n_K$ of dimension $k$. Let $X_1, \ldots, X_r$ be the irreducible components of $X$ of dimension $k$. I think that then we always have $$\deg \mathcal{F}=\sum_{i=1}^r \textrm{rank}(\mathcal{F}|_{X_i}) \cdot \deg X_i.$$ Does somebody know a reference where this can be found? 

Let $K_1,\ldots,K_m\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with $m\geq n$ some convex bodies (i.e. compact with nonempty interior). I am interested in sufficient criteria for the convex hull $K=\textrm{conv}(K_1,\ldots,K_m)$ to have a face of dimension $n-1$. Are there some nice criteria known? In particular, I am interested in the situation where for each subset $I\subset\{1,\ldots,m\}$ the convex hulls $\textrm{conv}(K_i,\,i\in I)$ and $\textrm{conv}(K_j,\,j\not\in I)$ are disjoint. This seems to be sufficient for $K$ having a face of dimension $n-1$ in small dimensions but I can't prove it in general. Is it true for all $m\geq n$? 

Let $X$ be a quasi projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. By the tangent cone of $X$ at a point $p \in X$, I mean the subvariety of the tangent space of $X$ at $p$ as it is defined in Harris' "Algebraic Geometry: A first course" (Lecture 20). In particular, the tangent cone is a reduced subscheme. Now let $X$ be locally around $p$ a complete intersection. I wonder whether the tangent cone at $p$ is also a complete intersection. If this is really the case, I would be glad for a reference. Otherwise I would be grateful for a counterexample. 

Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety. I would like to have a morphism $f: \tilde{X}\to X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ where $f$ is finite and birational, $f^* \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)$ is a very ample line bundle and $\tilde{X}$ is a smooth projective variety. Under which conditions does such a map exist? I think it should always exist if $X$ is an irreducible curve, but are there other classes? What happens if we drop one of the requirements on $f$? 

Let $n \geq 2$. Let $g_1, \ldots , g_{n-1} \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $q=g_1^2+\ldots +g_{n-1}^2$ is not divisible by $p=x_1^2+\ldots +x_n^2$. Let $m \geq 1$ be the smallest integer such that $p\cdot q$ is the sum of $m$ squares of polynomials. In the cases $n=2$ and $n=3$ it is rather easy to show that we always have $m \geq n$. Is this still true for $n >3$? Edit: Using Pfister forms, one can show that it is true whenever $n=2^k+1$ for some $k \geq 0$. 

Does such a real-rooted subspace exist for every $d\geq 1$? Actually I didn't even manage to find one for $d=2$, so I would already be glad about a degree two example. Is there a characterization of such vector spaces similar to the case of bivariate forms? Perhaps in terms of some matrices with Plucker coordinates as entries being positive semidefinite? 

Let $H$ be the Hilbert scheme of closed subschemes of $\mathbb{P}^n$ with a given Hilbert polynomial. I would like to have a reference (preferably from a published paper or book, not stacks project) for the following: The set of points in $H$ corresponding to a Cohen-Macaulay subscheme is an open subset. Does someone know a reference for that? 

Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^n$ be an irreducible, projective, Cohen-Macaulay variety of dimension $k$. Let $L \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^n$ be a linear space of dimension $n-k-1$ that does not intersect $X$. Then the linear projection $\pi: X \to \mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^k$ from center $L$ is a finite morphism. Let $R=\mathbb{C}[x_0,\ldots,x_k]$ and let $S$ be the homogeneous coordinate ring of $X$. Then $S$ is a finitely generated graded $R$-module via $\pi$. My question is: When is $S$ in fact a free $R$-module? In particular, I am interested in sufficient criteria and examples of when $S$ is not free. 

Let $f: X \to Y$ be a finite, surjective morphism of smooth, projective, irreducible varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $y \in Y$. 

Let $K$ be a field, if necessary algebraic closed or of characteristic zero. Let $k$ be a positive integer. I am interested in linear subspaces $M \subseteq \textrm{Sym}_n(K)$, where $\textrm{Sym}_n(K)$ is the vector space of all symmetric $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $K$, such that every matrix in $M$ has at most rank $k$. Are there any results on this problem? Is there a characterization of such subspaces? If we do not restrict to symmetric matrices, but consider vector spaces of $m \times n$ matrices of rank at most $k$, this question was solved in the 80's for $k\leq 3$ by Atkinson and independently by Eisenbud and Harris. But the case $k>4$ is yet unknown, as far as I know. I think that if we restrict to symmetric matrices, this should be far less complicated, so perhaps there are results for $k>4$. Thanks in advance!
