It means the equation isn't perfect, but just an estimation. You happen to have found one case where it fails quite a bit. Of course, it doesn't help that you didn't describe an actual human being (the shortest verified person is 54.6cm, that is 21.5 inches). I don't feel like doing the path, but I'm sure the formula provide reasonable estimations for reasonable input parameters. 

Just take it easy, if it's easy the first week or two, it doesn't mean it's going to remain easy forever. The biggest mistake to make with SS is to hurry too much. Remember, you are still increasing linearly and this is amazing progress! Pushing yourself too hard at the start can set you back later on for weeks. Next time, just increase by the set weight. I guarantee that by week three or so it will stop feeling easy. Here's the relevant quote from Rippetoe: 

Visualization can be an important part of doing an exercise right. I recently came upon a bit of advice on another website and I could immediately feel an improvement in my form (despite having done probably thousands of pullups before). My question is: do you know any good visualizations for doing pullups? For the record, the sentence which inspired this: During this initial movement, pretend that you are squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades and do not let the pencil drop during any phase of the pull-up. 

The Wilks score is used to compare powerlifting scores for lifters of different body weights. A coefficient 

Since you are only able to train on weekends, you want to make the most of your time. Train on Friday and Sunday, full body. There are a lot of full body routines out there to choose from. But be sure to focus on the compound exercises that deliver the most bang for your buck. (Squats deadlifts, presses, rows, etc.) designing a specific schedule of exercises and progression would be specific to your goals. I'm assuming you're mainly interested in general strength and conditioning. Now, because of the timing of your training sessions, you'd be best off keeping intensity high and volume low on the Friday session. Don't take any sets to failure, and no grinding reps. Save that for the Sunday session when you'll have plenty of time to recover before you train again the next Friday. On Sunday, do higher volume and moderate intensity work. Here, you can take some sets to failure, or near failure, and the odd grinder will be tolerable. Consider doing deadlifts only on the Sunday session. If you really want to do something on Saturday, consider just doing some LISS cardio. You could also do some HIIT cardio at the end of your Friday and Sunday sessions. On the other hand, some brisk walking or biking during the week would be more beneficial, if that would fit for you. (E.g., walking or biking to campus.) Be certain to attend carefully to your recovery between the Friday and Sunday sessions. Get lots of sleep and food. Actually, that applies every day but, I get it, you're in school. Best of luck. 

Overcoming Gravity, a popular book on gymnastic training for adults, has a chart comparing the difficulty of various skills. In the chart, a full human flag is a level 8 skill, which is "equivalent" to a press of your bodyweight, or weighted dips with 85% bodyweight added. The first progression to a flag, the tuck flag, is level 5 skill, equating a press with 0.65% of bodyweight or dips with ~37% added. Both of these sources are at best anecdotal, so take them with a grain of salt. My suggestion, if a human flag is one of your goals, is to start training specifically for it as soon as possible. If you can hold the tuck flag for at least 10s, then add it to your routine and practice! 

It's important to note that your weight varies daily based on all sorts of factors, most notably water retention (can account for a significant weight difference - we are mostly water after all). It is also important to weight yourself at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. Still, some variance will happen so it might be a good idea to weight yourself daily but plot the eg. 7-day average and consider that your "real" weight. If you are doing everything right, it should be going down, even if some days are higher than others. Finally, depending on your weight lifting program, you will start putting on muscle mass, which weights more than fat (if you consider the same volume), but depending on how much fat you need to "shift", this effect can take a while to be noticeable. 

When doing wrist curls or reverse one should dumbbell should move in plane perpendicular to ground or should it follow normal curved path as ulnar is shorter so weight moves toward ulnar side naturally. Which form is perfect? 

I wanted to workout by posterior delts, so I was doing revese chest fly on machine and I was able to do it with 80 pounds, but when Dumbbell Bent-Over Reverse Fly i am doing i can take only 10 pounds of dumbbell, why such a difference? 

I was doing this inclined curl source What i found that i could curl 25 pound with normal curl but with incline curl I can do only half of that, what is reason for decrease in strength ? 

When I am walking i observed I have two mode, in one I am walking normal way with all my body felling no tension, other one is in which my torso fill bit of stiff, it is feeling like walking by someone forcing me. Which muscles are getting worked out in both scenario? I hope other people also experience same. 

I am doing this excercise for back. But what I felt was that my biceps were getting more tensed than my back, what is I am doing wrong? P.S. my trainer is worst, dont teach much , but office gym so I have to cope. 

depending on the body weight "x" of the lifter in kilograms is multiplied by his or her total to arrive at a sort of "standardised" score for comparison. (It appears that it may also be used to compare individual lifts.) There are specific (sex-dependent) values given in the linked article for a,b,c,d,e,f. Is there any online source explaining the theory behind the Wilks score? The linked Wikipedia article does not explain where the denominator polynomial coefficients (a,b,c,d,e,f) come from and why the formula has the specific form given, and Google wasn't of much help. The quintic polynomial (a+bx+cx2+dx3+ex4+fx5) appearing in the denominator has three real roots. The negative root can be ignored as meaningless, and the two positive roots (roughly 13.5kg and 283kg) are presumably to be considered "out of range". Thus, I would guess this formula was obtained by fitting some collection of data. But what data? Alternatively, perhaps there is a theoretical model explaining these coefficients? (The only, admittedly crude, model I can think of is a multiplier very roughly like x-(2/3), which doesn't resemble the form given for Wilks, though the curves do have roughly the same overall shape on a sensible body-weight interval.) There must be some published literature on this, but I could not find it.
