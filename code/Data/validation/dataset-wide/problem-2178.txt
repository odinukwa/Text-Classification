I know it does not seem fair and it is not fair. But it is not uncommon as it is hours the company would have trouble monitoring. What if an employee reported 4 extra hours. Is what she is paid for posted hours worth the pay? This is a battle she could lose. Not saying it is fair. Don't just go at it for the principle alone. One option is to report it to the labor agency anonymously. I worked as a contractor and the company I worked for had a policy we did not get paid until the customer paid the invoice. Someone (not me as I did not even think of it) reported them the state labor commission and they immediately started paying us. 

Consult an attorney but if you are using company resource or company time then the compnay is likely to claim that as company property (if they want to). So you have a company laptop at a coffee shop and your ssh into you personal computer. Yes that is using a company resource but they would have to have to use a keystroke logger and then evaluate your key strokes. You are probably safe. For grins if you do plan to use that laptop for ssh then you should burn this SE account and don't post your picture if you are going to ask questions that could be used against you in a court of law. 

For the first option: do you really want to stay in a company, where you feel you've been cheated? And forcing your way to stay is probably not going to improve your image within the company. Plus they will probably use any opportunity to make you leave. The second, might feel tempting. But that's called burning bridges. It means that any further professional relationship with anyone involved (company, people), would be awkward at best. Plus you should also consider that these people know other people. You might get some satisfaction, but you certainly won't save your professional image. The third option is probably the most accepted one. You take the loss gracefully. And accept that you misunderstood something. In the future you'll make sure to always know where you stand. If, as you say, it's due to a personality difference with a single person, acting in a professional manner, would open various possibilities. One of them, being the reference provided by your boss. As for the question whether it is legal, do check with a lawyer. 

Generally, the most suggested approach is not to recommend anyone when you're fresh into a company. There are different reasons for that but you can consider at least that 

He then sent me a 1-on-1 meeting with a subject of "Discuss Lunchbox Fiasco". Use of the word "Fiasco" is troubling. He is pissed and you need to hope he cools down before the meeting. You should be able to tell early if he is blaming you or just wants to talk about how it played out and how to avoid something like this in the future. If he does blame you then: I would not pass blame to the employees. But, they are the ones to blame here. This is a consequence that I know I would not have thought of. It was obviously a popular swag. Any swag can be suffer from this type of confusion. Hat, coat, bag .... I would not lead out with this but if says we need guideline for future swag tell him unless it is personalized then any swag will suffer from this. I would just tell him: 

It is a relative minor defect where the buttons just don't display properly. That would be characterized as a non critical bug. I seriously doubt any software company would go back and patch a prior release for a non critical bug. Who says you need to deal with an unreasonable boss in a reasonable manner? Putting the boss in the middle is not going to fix anything. Yelling at a rep is not going to get them to patch. It will only serve to damage the relation ship with the vendor. Use 'any means necessary' (AKA yelling/belittling the rep). In a slightly elevated voice to the support person say "Really so you have no authority to fix my problem". Technically you have yelled and belittled but have done no real harm. Boss I did everything I can. "I yelled and I belittled. I thought he/she was going to cry. I personally don't have the clout to get them to patch a prior release. They have stated it is fixed in the current release. At this point we may need to legal involved and review the contact to see if we can force them to patch a prior release." 

If your wife is unemployed, meaning that you have a need for her to get a job, you might consider asking your direct boss, or the person responsible for the new customer service hire, depending on the size of the company, and how familiar you are with people around. 

The fact that it is a scolarship does not change the equation. And generally, it is recommended not to tell anything at your working place until you get something clear (job offer, contract... or scolarship acceptance). Your work probably includes a trial time (typically a few months) which is also for such cases. So for the time being, no need to tell them anything. But as soon as you get a positive confirmation (possibly in paper form), do tell them as soon as possible. You might want to check your contract to see how long you have to work when resigning. It's usually different during the trial, but both should be in your contract. 

Though, from your description, Trish sounds to have some issues, I would venture to guess that the reason why she was a upset, was due to a breach of confidence. She might have felt that she could talk to you about anything, anytime and that you would be there to listen. But then she discovers that you don't keep her information to yourself but that you share it with other colleagues and/or friends. Confidence expectation are always something complex, often expected but rarely outspoken. From what you previously described of her, that realisation might have given her a feeling of treason. And she reacts impulsively. So now to your actions: 

Keep a record of when, what was said, and name(s) of witnesses. It kind of depends on what was said and how. I would like to slap you for that opinion in a light tone is different than I would like to punch you in the face right now in a raised voice. Neither are proper but there are different degrees. If the threats are minor then talk to your boss and see if they stop. If threats are major then wait for 3 or 4 and report to HR or his boss. If he stands up or approaches to physically intimidate then report immediately. Clearly this is a matter of opinion. 

As I said in a comment that is just too much time to bury. Just put it at the end of the resume and don't mention it in cover the letter. Don't bold it and don't go into a lot of detail. You are just explaining the time. 

If it makes you feel put off then yes that is a problem. If it creates chasm then you are the one creating the chasm. The intent from your boss is to enhance the working relationship and show appreciation for your work. You should working on replying "you are welcome" and be sincere. 

You're essentially down to the same path that anyone who wants to learn something in their free time. If there are no internal experts look for them elsewhere. The following are the best resources 

Talk to your boss. Your boss can only manage when he gets the info. For whatever reason, he might not have realised the increase of workload, and the weariness you have. It's perfectly ok to tell them. If you don't want to be too abrupt about it, start by asking what are the perspective for the new hire. And if you don't want to appear as complaining, don't complain, simply keep to the fact: you have a lot of work for you to handle and you're not sure you'll make it. If you're really overloaded, your boss might prioritize things, or find other resources to, temporarily, take part of it off your shoulder. If you wait until the last moment, and don't make it, it would be much worse and take out any chance for your boss to think about an alternative solution. 

While I think that you could contact them again to say that you are physically available again, I don't think that you should propose a face-to-face interview. You don't have all the details of the hiring process. Maybe they don't need another interview. Maybe they are waiting for some budget, maybe they already have someone, etc. While you can be active to arrange details, the decision to have an interview or not lies with the hiring company. Not the candidate. 

Two a manager has access to much of your HR file. Three he should not have read it to the staff. IANAL but to me you would have a hard time getting damages from a court of law. 

A phone number is personal information and you have no obligation to share it with coworkers. The argument from the accepted answer of you don't have to take the call is BS. If the phone rings at 2 AM it took away from my personal life. I am neither female nor attractive but but that is private information. If you are harassed by a coworker because that number was published the company has exposed themselves to a lawsuit. If there is a business need for emergency response then a business cell phone should be issued and published callout process. I am IT and no way my personal phone is a business phone. I barely have a personal life as it is. Would the NFL or NBA require a player to publish a private phone number? 

I think this is trolling. Not even good trolling. Assume it is not trolling. Supervisor is an obsolete idiot to believe this and not check out the story. Does it rise to criminally negligent - I doubt it. I agree with a comment that an employer cannot withhold pay without a judicial order at least in the US. IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer) 

And that really depends on the audience you want to reach. People who would be familiar with the kind of work you've done would expect to see a certain amount of details. For those who aren't (HR?) would not appreciate, might misunderstand, and would essentially frown on that amount of information. So you should keep the name of the places, dates, research centres, etc. But try to see how that experience is relevant to finance. Why does that experience make you desirable in finance, compared to someone who did not have that experience? And, the best would be to get to layman's language... but financial language would be very good as well. It shows you are already projecting yourself on the job. Avoid: 

We all love some gossip, but they can be harmful to the subject. While it's reasonable to ask some help to deal with it, I would recommend to avoid doing it in written form. She may behave like a 3-years old child, but she's a grown up, you're not her mother, if she decides to leave, let her do it. It might even be good for her, for all we know. Clarify with HR the whole situation. But you're 8. HR probably know how you behave usually, so I would not worry. Never, ever again, leave your computer unlock when you aren't working on it. Especially if you have potentially sensible documents on it. I have heard/read about people being fired for exactly this. (Even if, hopefully, rare). Don't use your professional mail for personal discussions. While often tolerated, it is usually not allowed. And your professional mails are often stored, meaning they might be fully accessible to your boss and/or the IT. 

Ask for bump Turn in your resignation and let them ask what it would take for you to stay You can hint at it with "I like it here but the offer is more money and here I am at 2% of payout at risk." 

Going straight to a pay cut with no performance discussion is just odd. A pay cut in general is just odd. If you were hired into one position and did not perform and they offered another lower level position and told you the pay for new position is lower then maybe. You are doing the job your were hired into and they have not given any performance issues other than not productive enough. You know your performance has increase but your supervisor still suggested you have not improved. They should be telling you specific expectations of the position you are not performing and help you improve. Not fair but not much you can do about it. Stay calm and find a new job. 

It was a ticket assigned to you by a PM and you completed it. Mark it as complete. If your coworker wants to delete it then let them. If your PM asks you what happened then tell them. It was just 2 hours of work. No need to escalate this. You want it to play out with as little fan fair as possible.
