Wikipedia has a more accurate Luminosity calculation but it is a multiple curve fit solution and it only gives significantly different answers at the extreme high and low end of star masses. This is a great thing to calculate and store in a spreadsheet, which is what I do. Limitations The formula above will only generate stars with a mass $ 0.08 \cdot M_{\odot} < M_{star} < 120 \cdot M_{\odot}$. However, as far as I understand it that is pretty accurate. Lately, I have read of stars with a mass of up to 200 sols but I don't feel like regenerating this empirical formula for that slight change. At the high end, my formula predicts a Luminosity up to 20x that of the Wiki formula. Other thoughts If a universe of red dwarf stars seems too boring, then arrange the plot/setting to explain that fewer of the boring stars and more of the interesting ones are represented (e.g. the tramlines rarely go to "boring" red dwarf stars or dangerous supernova remnants).

BOLDED section is of special importance. We have switched to the introduction of a very narrow type of AI (artificial/machine learning). It means that with enough study and processing power and Star Trek style Universal Translator might one day be possible but it could probably not work as quickly as that shown in the movies. 

No It is not possible to permanently eliminate modern weapons. I wanted to write the answer that Mike L. wrote. Since he beat me, I'll write a minority opinion. Politics Anytime 3 or more people interact, you get politics (the art of persuading third parties in a dispute). Non-physical politics will eventually fail for one of those three participants which means if one of them feels strongly enough about the issue, they'll resort to violence. In those cases, the best armed person usually wins. So there will always be an advantage to arming yourself and your clan / group better than your potential rivals are equipped. People find a way As Mike L. pointed out, modern weapons do have a shelf life and after an apocalypse, eventually all of those weapons will become inoperable. But people will also remember them and some survivors will likely remember how to make them. Eventually the pressures for arming your group with better weapons will become strong enough that they'll begin attempting to recreate modern weapons. The first attempts will be crude but, if left alone long enough, the survivors will eventually recreate modern weapons. No matter how strongly you regulate & control things, if you make it unpleasant enough for the common citizenry, they will eventually figure out a means of making them. For instance, a single gun smith could probably create a long gun from scratch. Post & pre apocalypse weapon overlap You will also likely have some overlap with post-apocalypse weapons being built while some pre-apocalypse weapons (artifacts of great power) still work. Remember there are still operational field artillery from the US Civil War floating around out there. So it might take a long while indeed for properly cared for equipment to all fail. No explosives?? Your "no explosives" stipulation is not realistic or practical. Anything which can burn can be made to explode under the right conditions. So what you're really saying is that no one can burn anything anymore - the laws of chemistry have been suspended. You can find youtube videos of coffee creamer cannons, flour cannons, and here's a "sawdust cannon". $URL$ 

The Details Charged antimatter (i.e. anti-protons) is currently stored primarily with a magnetic trap/mirror. In these systems we store small numbers of anti-hydrogen nuclei (anti-protons). Researchers have created neutral anti-hydrogen (anti-proton with positron) and stored it for up to 16 minutes at a time. Furthermore, the Earth and Saturn have been found to naturally produce and store anti-matter in their magnetic fields. Storage in rings like this might work as long term storage but wouldn't work for use as spacecraft fuel. So let's look at a best case scenario and assume we've developed a method of creating anti-Tungsten (lowest vapor pressure element). Put a small charge on it so we can handle it with electromagnetic fields. Place your anti-tungsten block in a perfect vacuum (we can't achieve this but let's assume we can) and chill the block to reduce vapor pressure. As stray anti-atoms and atoms break loose from the solid structure, they wander around and eventually hit something (either matter or anti-matter). If a tungsten atom hits another tungsten atom, then nothing much happens. However, when anti-tungsten hits tungsten, all of that energy is released in your fuel tank. Each individual reaction doesn't do much except slightly warm the surface on which the impact happened. However, that warming causes additional atoms to break loose from the surface and cause repeat collisions. I read an article which indicated that since we can only cool the anti-tungsten block through radiative cooling, we can't keep up with the production of energy and that block's temperature increases over time. As the temperature increases so does the reaction rate. Eventually the temperature gets high enough to become destructive, you lose containment, and your ship goes BOOM. I am not up to doing the necessary math at this point and my recollection of all this is at least 10 years old - so I could definitely be wrong. Still bulk & long-term anti-matter storage is a problem we haven't solved and don't have any good strategies for solving using our current state of knowledge and technology. How it might look/work But the most plausible strategy would probably look something like what I described above: a low vapor pressure metal stored in complete vacuum inside a container of the same material. You free the tungsten atoms for use in the engine by hitting it with a very precise laser designed to knock the atoms loose and ionize them at the same time. Then use electromagnetic fields and lasers to manipulate the freed particles into the reaction chamber.
