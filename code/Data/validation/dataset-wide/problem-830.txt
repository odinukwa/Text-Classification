First generation stars didn't do the CNO cycle initally. It is estimated, that after the Big Bang three quarters of the matter is hydogren, one quarter helium, and trace amounts of heavier elements. This is then also the composition of (as of now unobserved) first generation stars, having zero metallicity. Even though those stars probably were very massive, they could not run the CNO cycle initially. Luckily, the CNO cycle is not the only nuclear fusion process in stars. In the proton-proton chain reaction, hydrogen is fused into helium. The star is in equilibrium until the hydrogen in the core is "used up". Then it may collapse and heat until the triple-alpha process begins to produce carbon. From there on there are more and more processes producing many different elements. Due to convection and shell-burning, the CNO cycle might have been running in those first generation stars at later stages. Interestingly, the most massive of the first generation (population III) stars may have ended up as black holes, gobbling up all of the produced metals (elements heavier than helium). Many others may have exploded in pair-instability supernovae ejecting all material into interstellar space, leaving no compact remnant behind. A Heger and S. E.

As you have already identified the objects you were seeing, I'll explain the effect you were seeing. In that situation there are three things to consider: atmospheric chromatic dispersion, seeing and human color perception. Light entering the atmosphere is refracted, because of the changing speed of light in air compared to the vacuum of space. The amount of refraction depends on the wavelength, causing optical dispersion. This effect is strongest for objects appearing near the horizon. Basically the different color components of the star's image appear at slightly different elevations in the sky (nice in-depth explanation). Turbulence in the atmosphere causes the "twinkling" or seeing. Moving pockets of hotter and colder air act like lenses that are projecting the star's light into varying directions, so a varying amount of light reaches your eye. Together with the dispersion this produces a colorful twinkling. Because the color perception in the human eye doesn't work in faint light, this colorful twinkling is observed for the brightest stars only. The doppler shift is not the reason for the red and blue colors. At a typical velocity dispersion of 30km/s of our surrounding stars, the doppler shift changes the wavelength by an imperceptible 10-4 fraction. Also this would have to change extremely rapidly, which simply does not occur for our average night-sky stars or most other objects, for that matter :-) 

The size of a black hole is not defined by the expanse of its matter content but (usually) its event horizon. The radius of the event horizon (of a non-rotating and uncharged black hole) depends on the mass: $$r_S = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}\\ \small M : \text{black hole mass} \\ \small G: \text{gravitational constant} \\ \small c : \text{speed of light} \\ \small r_S : \text{Schwarzschild radius}$$ Yes, the size of black holes as final stage of stellar evolution stems from the original star's mass, though some mass is ejected/radiated away during the supernova. Black holes do grow (increasing $M$ and $r_S$) when they accrete matter from disks or companion stars. Not all black holes we (kind of) observe are from stars: for example supermassive black holes in galactic centers, which can have billions of solar masses. However, it is not yet fully understood, how they form. Note: The most common black hole descriptions actually don't include any matter. They are defined in an empty spacetime except for one singular point that is usually interpreted to hold all the matter. The mass of the black hole is then assigned by identifying the gravitational pull in the Newtonian approximation at some distant point. How the interior of real, non-vacuum black holes looks like, is still up to discussion. 

There are three kinds of different hyperbolic in this question and the previous answer by AtmosphericPrisonEscape: the behavior of Lorentz transformations, the spatial hypersurfaces in cosmology (which seem to be flat), and the hyperbolic appearance of spacetime when tracing world lines in a universe with accelerated expansion. TL;DR: Spacetime is expanding exponentially and if you choose an unconventional hypersurface, that hypersurface is hyperbolic. Lorentz transformations: Lorentz covariance is the mathematical expression of Einstein's principle of the constancy of the speed of light. Changing the frame of reference of an observer is done by a Lorentz transformation which preserves the light cone and is closely related to the concept of causality. The answer to this question explains this for the Minkowski space, where a Lorentz transform is a hyperbolic rotation. In this flat (Minkowskian) spacetime: $$ ds^2 = c\, dt^2 - dx^2 $$ you can use a Lorentz transform to switch to different coordinates $dt$ and $dx$ while the line element $ds$ is invariant, analogous to the hyperbola $$ 1 = a^2 - b^2. $$ This kind of hyperbolic is not the point of the question. Cosmology: If we assume large scale homogeneity and isotropy (Copernican principle), we can choose isochronous coordinates. There you have a synchronous time $t$ and spatial hypersurfaces for given $t$ ("time slices"). Freely falling observers are comoving, i.e. have fixed spatial coordinates $\mathbf x$. Their world lines are perpendicular to the spatial hypersurfaces and their proper time matches the synchronous time $\tau = t$. Galaxy clusters are such freely falling observers. If you take these assumptions and allow time dependence of spatial coordinates on time, you end up with the FLRW metric: $$ ds^2 = c\, dt^2 - a(t)^2 d\Sigma^2$$ where $d\Sigma^2$ describes the spatial hypersurface. Now additionally to this being a hyperbolic equation, the hypersurfaces $d\Sigma^2$ can have curvature, especially constant positive (closed sphere), zero (Euclidean), or constant negative (open hyperboloid) curvature. A flat universe is, for example, given by $$ d\Sigma^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega,\\ \text{where}\quad d\Omega = d\theta^2 + \sin(\theta)^2\, d\phi^2, $$ which is the metric of Euclidean 3-space in spherical coordinates. Here the only relative acceleration between freely falling observers comes from the scale factor $a(t)$. A hyperbolic spacetime could be $$ d\Sigma^2 = dr^2 + \sinh(r)^2 d\Omega $$ which is a hyperbolic plane in spherical coordinates. In such a spacetime, freely falling observers do not only measure a relative acceleration due to the scale factor, but an additional contribution due to the curvature of space. Expansion: In the FLRW metric you see the scale factor $a(t)$. The Friedmann equations describe the evolution of the scale factor. It does not influence the qualitative shape of the spatial hypersurfaces, but in an expanding space their curvature becomes more and more flat (just like the surface of a sphere locally becomes more and more flat as the sphere expands). A flat $d\Sigma$ and a constant $a$ gives you no acceleration between freely falling observers whatsoever. An $a$ with constant change manifests as all observers flying apart, but no relative acceleration. Finally, an $a$ with constant acceleration makes everything fly apart ever faster (currently observed). The Friedmann equations tell us, that the behaviour of $a$ changed during the lifetime of the universe as different effects where dominating (radiation, matter, cosmological constant). Currently we observe an accelerating universe, so $a$ is exponentially increasing (just at the right end of the illustration). If you look at the world line of two Galaxies, their physical distance increases exponentially. Therefore the circumference of a chunk of space increases exponentially, so the hypersurface spanned by a line of freely falling observers is actually hyperbolic (white grid in the illustration). However, I struggle to put that into an equation that clearly shows the hyperbolicity, so don't trust that too much, yet. 

Neutrinos have nearly zero rest mass and travel nearly as fast as light. That means that observations of neutrino flashes match up with observations of photons from the same source up to a small delay. So if you locate the origin of the neutrino (as angular position on sky) you can simply look it up in existing imagery or look there with a telescope, and the light you see basically traced the same path through time and space as the neutrino. An active black hole as mentioned in the article should be visible in standard deep sky observations. (I couldn't find the article, so I'm relying on your quote here.) If another source "moves in the way" just as the neutrino passes it, you will also see both sources at the same time with your telescope here on earth. Then you either identify them, eg. by energy signature, or you cannot see the more distant one, or you simply cannot decide for one of them. Like all other objects that are freely falling through space and time, neutrinos follow geodesics (generalization of straight lines) through spacetime and are affected by gravitational lenses just as photons are. In the Newtonian picture, all objects, independent from their mass, are accelerated the same in a gravitational field. In a way, it is true, that tracing the sources of neutrinos is easier because they are weakly interacting. If they were interacting more strongly, you would see fewer of them and they might have been deflected, by scattering for example. As a disadvantage, you get less secondary observations and less information from the source and the line of sight. The electromagnetic waves we measure on earth contain riches of data in their spectrum (structure and composition of source, hydrogen and molecular clouds along the line-of-sight, ...). 

TL;DR look at the diagram at the end of the post. Following the Principle of Relativity, the laws of physics are the same everywhere and for every observer. Despite that, measurements of observers can differ, as long as they are consistent within the rules of general relativity. Furthermore, horizons limit what can be measured by some observer. In this spirit, let's do a Gedankenexperiment: Take an off-the-shelf black hole spacetime: non-rotating, uncharged and spherically symmetric with mass $M$. Add some matter that is falling towards the black hole: a thin shell of gas to keep the spherical symmetry (very low density gas, such that we can ignore heating and other accretion processes). Let's throw in a beacon, that follows the gas shell and emits light signals in constant intervals. What happens? Freely Falling Observer This is actually really simple to describe in words: Everything crashes into the singularity (or whatever garbage dump might be left over from all the spaceships, astronauts, beacons and hypothetical particles that other physicists have thrown in there). The curvature of spacetime is increasing towards the singularity and there is no other curvature singularity other than the center of the black hole. This means, that the gas and the beacon smoothly fall straight through the event horizon and from their point of view there is nothing extraordinary about that (apart from the extreme gravitational lensing and the noticeable tidal forces). Remarkably, they reach the central singularity in finite time, i.e. the beacon emits a finite number of signals before it hits the singularity. Outside Observer You have specified an outside observer at a fixed position, but then just go to a fixed position that is so far away, that we can call it infinitely far away. This is mathematically convenient for the description and one of the most common observers chosen, because you don't feel the gravitation of the black hole anymore and your everyday spacetime coordinates are exactly the coordinates of the Schwarzschild metric. This infinity is only approximated for convenience and has nothing to do with the infinity at the event horizon. This outside observer sees the gas fall towards the black hole. The closer it gets to the event horizon, the more it seems to slow down and the fainter it becomes. The reason is, that the light needs more and more time to leave the gravitational well of the black hole. Light emitted exactly at the event horizon would need infinitely long to reach this observer. The signals that the beacon emitted before it crossed the event horizon (in its own proper time of the freely falling observer) are stretched longer and longer into infinity and the total number of signals the observer can ever measure is still finite. Basically the life of the beacon can be divided into an observable part and an unobservable part. The observable part is stretched into infinity such that we say that the beacon is slowing down. Saying that light takes longer is not entirely correct and in some way similar to saying that there is more space, because the speed of light is constant. This is described correctly by the Schwarzschild coordinates, which have a coordinate singularity at the event horizon. This singularity is not intrinsic to the spacetime (not a curvature singularity) but arises from the choice of this coordinate system. This description is equally valid and describes the correct physical behavior, just as the freely falling observer. The apparent paradox of these two different observations can be cleared up by a careful look at the transformation between the observers like many other supposed paradoxa from special relativity. Growing the Event Horizon Now we come to the heart of the question: the change of the event horizon. The black hole has an event horizon at $$ R_1 = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}. $$ There is a second Schwarzschild radius of the mass of the original black hole $M$ combined with the total gas mass $m$: $$ R_2 = \frac{2 G (M + m)}{c^2} > R_1. $$ The outside observer sees the gas approximating the outer event horizon $R_2$. To see why, change to the freely falling observer and check what happens to the light emitted by the beacon when it passes the outer event horizon. The expansion of the Schwarzschild radius from $R_1$ to $R_2$ is not something you see from the gas shell itself. However, other accreting stuff that fell in before is eclipsed! Imagine a reckless astronaut who coasted into the black hole before we launched our gas shell. From our vantage point we see him or her approximating the event horizon $R_1$. But at some point the gas shell is so close to the old event horizon, that the new outer event horizon hinders some of the light that previously could have reached us to escape. Still the image of the astronaut doesn't disappear completely, you can only observe less of the astronaut's proper time. This might be more easily explained graphically, so I made a sketch. It is in Schwarzschild coordinates and the most important feature is, that the light cone closes up and tilts towards the singularity the closer you get to the event horizon. Exactly at the event horizon the light cone is not well defined. Light from the astronaut emitted at point A is visible to us, but delayed by the gas shell. Light emitted by Light emitted at point B is extremely delayed and close to the limiting case of which moment will be stretched into infinity. Light from point C could have reached us without the additional mass, but now it is bound by the additional mass. I don't think that there is a very nice description of how the light from point C ends up inside the black hole, because the coordinate singularity is not at a fixed point anymore and non-vacuum black hole solutions are tricky in any case.
