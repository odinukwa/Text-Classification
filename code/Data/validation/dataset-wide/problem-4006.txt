I am a little nervous writing this, because it is far from my field. But it was my understanding that there is a much more basic problem in proving the binary Goldbach conjecture by analytic methods. Let $P$ be any set of positive integers and let $f_P(x) = \sum_{p \in P} x^p$. Then the behavior of $f_P$ near $1$ depends on the rate of growth of $\pi_P(n) := \# \{ k \in P: \ k \leq n \}$. Similarly, the behavior of $f_P$ near $e^{2 \pi i \ell/m}$ depends on the rates of growth of the functions $\pi_P(n: r,m) := \# \{ k \in P : \ k\leq n,\ k \equiv r \mod m \}$. The cricle method is all about making this dependence precise, and about approximating $f_P(e^{i \theta})$ by $f_P(e^{2 \pi i \ell/m})$ for some rational approximation $\ell/m$ to $\theta/(2 \pi)$. However, there is a set of integers $P$ for which all the $\pi_{P}(n: r,m)$ have the same growth rates as for the primes, yet binary Goldbach is false for $P$. So, rather than improving the details of the circle method, one is left with a fundamentally new problem: Thinking of new properties of the primes to make use of. 

The authors have been talking about these results for long before the above linked preprint was made public. Here are some earlier references: A 2009 lecture by Zharkov at MSRI. Section 2.2 of Kristin Shaw's thesis (a student of Mikhalkin). 

To my understanding, all of these papers use some form of folding construction to reduce to the skew-symmetric case. This is a problem, because there are quivers which cannot be unfolded! See Example 14.4 in 

$\def\QQ{\mathbb{Q}}\def\RR{\mathbb{R}}$A community wiki answer to record the proof sketched above. I had misread the question earlier; the comments of S.Carnahan and user36938 are correct. Let $\sigma$ be an element of order $2$ in $Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$ and let $R$ be the fixed field of $\sigma$. By the Artin-Schrier theorem, $R$ is real closed. In particular, it comes with a natural order $\leq_R$ defined by $a \leq_R b$ if $\sqrt{b-a} \in R$. Lemma The order $\leq_R$ is archimedean. Proof Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is some $t \in R$ with $t >_R a$ for all $a \in \QQ$. Let $t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n-1} \cdots + a_0$ be the minimal polynomial of $t$ over $\QQ$. But then $$|a_{n-1} t^{n-1} \cdots + a_0| \leq_R t^{n-1} \sum | a_i | <_R t^n,$$ a contradiction. Here, for $x \in R$, the notation $|x|$ means whichever of $x$ and $-x$ is nonnegative in the order $\leq_R$. $\square$ So, as an ordered field, $R$ embeds in $\RR$. Let $\phi: R \to \RR$ be this embedding. Let $\RR^{alg}$ be the field of algebraic elements in $\RR$. Since $R$ is algebraic over $\QQ$, we have $\phi(R) \subseteq \RR^{alg}$. Since no nontrivial finite extension of $R$ can be ordered (property 6 on Wikipedia's list of properties of real closed fields), we actually have $\phi(R) = \RR^{alg}$. We have $\bar{\QQ} = R(\sqrt{-1}) = \RR^{alg}(\sqrt{-1})$. So we can extend $\phi$ to an automorphism of $\bar{\QQ}$ by declaring it to fix $\sqrt{-1}$. Then $\phi$ conjugates $\sigma$ to complex conjugation. 

Yes. The relation you are imposing between $\pi$ and $\sigma$ is called weak order -- specifically, you are saying that $\sigma \leq_W \pi$ where $\leq_W$ is weak order. Every maximal weak chain is also a maximal strong chain, so take a maximal weak chain from $\sigma$ to $\pi$ and it wil have the required property. 

I believe this is a special case of Case (9) in Theorem 3.9 of Allman, Cuenca and Huang. By the way, this paper was an REU project! 

Okay, so what about $2^r$? What one wants to show is that there is only one index $2^{2r}$ ideal in $H$. I haven't found a ring theory way to do this, but a direct proof isn't hard. Notice that, if $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ is even, then $(a,b,c,d)$ must be integers, and an even number of $(a,b,c,d)$ must be odd. So we can write $a+b+cj+dk = \epsilon + 2 (a' + b'i+c'j+d'k)$ which $\epsilon$ is one of $0$, $1+i$, $1+j$, $1+k$, $i+j$, $i+k$, $j+k$ or $1+i+j+k$. Each option for $\epsilon$ is divisible by $(1+i)$, and we also have $2=(1+i)(1-i)$. So we have shown that, if $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ is even, then $1+i$ divides $a+bi+cj+dk$. By induction, then, $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = 2^r$, then $a+bi+cj+dk$ is a unit times $(1+i)^r$. 

You might want to read the early parts of Basic Number Theory, by A. Weil. Weil shows how to do all of these proofs in a very clean way which is uniform between the number field and the function field case; his proofs are all based on local compactness. However, I don't think that Weil's proofs are morally different from the standard ones. In my, perhaps limited, experience, all proofs of these results are based on the pigeonhole principle (including the extension that, in a measure space of measure $1$, any two open sets whose measure add up to more than $1$ must meet.) As a warning, remember that these results are false for function fields over $\mathbb{C}$. If $X$ is an affine algebraic curve over $\mathbb{C}$ with positive genus, then the class group of $\mathcal{O}_X$ is infinite and the unit group may have rank less than the number of punctures minus $1$. 

At a lower level than Flajolet and Sedgewick, Chapter 5 of generatingfunctionology by Wilf is a good introduction to complex analytic methods. (Yes, my two answers look very similar. As usual in a big list question, I am posting separate answers so people can vote on them separately.) 

What about just taking the real valued random variable which lands in the interval $(x, x+dx)$ with probability $(1/\pi) dx/(1+x^2)$? The fourth moment is $$\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{x^4 dx}{(1+x^2)}$$ which is extremely divergent. 

Answer to the precise question: When $\mathrm{Tor}^1(A/I, A/J)=0$. Proof: We have the exact sequence $$0 \to I \to A \to A/I \to 0$$ Tensoring with $A/J$, we get $$0 \to \mathrm{Tor}^1(A/I, A/J) \to I/(I \cdot J) \to A/J \to A/(I+J) \to 0.$$ The left hand term is $0$ because $A$ is flat as an $A$-module. Now, what is the kernel of $I \mapsto A/J$? Clearly, it is $I \cap J$. So the kernel of $I/(I \cdot J) \to A/J$ is $(I \cap J)/(I \cdot J)$. We see that $I \cap J = I \cdot J$ if and only if $\mathrm{Tor}^1(A/I, A/J)=0$. 

The ring in question may be identified with the ring of $N$-invariant functions on $G$. (Where $N$ is the unipotent radical of $G$.) In type $A$, the group $G$ is $n \times n$ matrices with determinant $1$. A function is $N$ invariant if it is preserved by rightward column operations. (That is, adding $a \times (\mbox{column} \ i)$ to $\mbox{column} \ j$, for $i<j$.) It is obvious that those minors which use the left $k$ columns for some $k$ have this invariance. In fact the ring is generated by these minors, which are called Plucker coordinates. The relations between these minors, called Plucker relations, are also extremely classical and well known. A good low level reference to this topic is Chapter 14 of Miller and Sturmfels' book Combinatorial Commutative Algebra. 

To make the obvious comment, $v$ and $w$ define the same positive system if they lie on the same side of $(s-c)^{\perp}$, where $s$ ranges through the noncentral points of the simplex and $c$ is the center. So your question is whether we can characterize the regions in the complement of this hyperplane arrangement. 

There should be a relationship like this, because the heat function proof of Hirzebruch-Riemmann-Roch uses a much more refined equality between hilbert functions and Laplacian spectra. Let me see if I can put this together. Let $M$ be a $d$-dimensional smooth projective variety. Let $L^k$ be the line bundle on $M$ obtained by restricting $\mathcal{O}(k)$ from projective space. Equip $M$ with the Fubini-Study metric. We have the complex of vector spaces: $$0 \to C^{\infty}(L^k) \overset{\bar{\partial}}{\longrightarrow} C^{\infty}(L^k \otimes \Omega^{0,1}) \overset{\bar{\partial}}{\longrightarrow} \cdots \overset{\bar{\partial}}{\longrightarrow} C^{\infty}(L^k \otimes \Omega^{0,d}) \to 0. \quad (\dagger)$$ Here $\Omega^{0,q}$ is the vector bundle of $(0,q)$-differential forms and $C^{\infty}(\mathrm{vector \ bundle})$ means $C^{\infty}$ sections of that vector bundle. We can use the two metrics on $L^k$ and on $X$ to define an inner products on $C^{\infty}(L^k \otimes \Omega^{0,q})$. Let $\bar{\partial}^{\ast}$ be the adjoint to $\bar{\partial}$ and let $\Delta_{L^k} = \bar{\partial} \bar{\partial}^{\ast} + \bar{\partial}^{\ast} \bar{\partial}$. This is not the ordinary Laplacian -- it acts on sections of $L^k$ tensored with differential forms rather than acting on differential forms. All of this is pretty standard : See Wells Differential Geometry on Complex Manifolds or Voisin's Complex Algebraic Geometry and Hodge Theory for background on this kind of construction. Since $\bar{\partial}$ commutes with $\Delta_{L^k}$, the sequence $(\dagger)$ splits up into finite dimensional sequences for every eigenspace of $\Delta_{L^k}$. (There is some deep analysis with Sobolev spaces necessary to make this precise.) Let $(\dagger)_{\lambda}$ be the corresponding sequence of $\lambda$ eigensequences. Since $\Delta_{L^k}$ is positive semidefinite, you only get terms with $\lambda \geq 0$. For $\lambda >0$, we have the homotopy $\mathrm{Id} = (1/\lambda) (\bar{\partial} \bar{\partial}^{\ast} + \bar{\partial}^{\ast} \bar{\partial})$, so $(\dagger)_{\lambda}$ is exact for $\lambda>0$. On $(\dagger)_0$, we have $\bar{\partial}=0$ so the sequence is trivial. For $k$ large, it turns out that only the first term has a nontrivial $0$-eigenspace. That eigenspace is the kernel of $\bar{\partial}$ acting on $C^{\infty}(L^k)$, which is to say, the holomorphic sections of $L^k$. So its dimension is the Hilbert function. More generally, for all $k$, the alternating sum of the dimensions of the $0$-eigenspaces is the Hilbert polynomial. Gather up the eigenvalues into a generating function: $$\theta(L^k, q, t) = \sum e^{-\lambda t} \dim{\LARGE (}\lambda\mathrm{-eigenspace \ of\ } C^{\infty}(L^k \otimes \Omega^{0,q}) {\LARGE )}.$$ Then the above argument shows that $$h(k) = \sum_q (-1)^q \theta(L^k, q, t). \quad (\S)$$ Note that $(\S)$ holds for all $t$. Now, in the height function proof, one engages in a detailed analysis of the asymptopics of $\theta(L^k, q, t)$ as $t \to 0$. When $t \to 0$, all of the $e^{-\lambda t}$ terms go to $1$, so $\theta$ blows up, and the rate at which it blows up depends on the growth rate of the eigenvalues of $\Delta_{L^k}$. One gets an asymptopic formula that looks like $\Theta(t) = a_{2d} t^{-d}+a_{2d-1} t^{-d+1/2} + \cdots + a_0 + O(t^{1/2})$. Plugging into $(\S)$ and comparing constant terms, one gets the following formula, which is Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch slightly specialized to our setting: $$h(k) = \int_M \frac{ e^{k \omega} \prod \alpha_i}{\prod (1-e^{- \alpha_i})}.$$ Here $\omega$ is the Fubini-Study form, $\alpha_i$ are the Chern roots of $T^{\ast} M$ and we are using the convention that you ignore all terms not in top degree when integrating. You are interested only in the leading power of $k$. We have $e^{k \omega} = 1+k \omega + k \omega^2/2+ \cdots + k^d \omega^d/d!$, where the sum stops because we have reached top degree, so the leading term is $\frac{k^d}{d!} \int_M \omega^d = \frac{k^d}{d!} \mathrm{Vol}(M)$, which is your left hand side. Is there a way to get the large $k$ behavior of the $\theta$'s without getting the exact result? I don't know. Also, you would want to switch from $\Delta_{L^k}$ to $\Delta$ at some point. I haven't seen anyone work this out, but I do remember there is a lemma which relates $\Delta$ and $\Delta_{L^k}$ for $k$ large and that Griffiths and Harris use it in their proof of Serre vanishing. I covered this proof in my Hodge theory course, so I am a little embarrassed not to remember the details! It should be in the notes for April 12. Anyway, possibly you can figure out how to finish the proof from here.
