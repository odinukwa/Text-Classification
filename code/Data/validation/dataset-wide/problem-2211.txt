What are the criteria to play in one of the two teams of NBA all star game? And what about to take part to other speciality games (smash/3 points)? 

Here the updated wikipedia pages with the list It is interesting to notice that for Nadal this 2017 Roland Garros represents his personal career record for percentage of game won on game losts (116 GW vs only 35 GL => 76.8%) 

4x100m relay are composed by 4 runners that run approximately 100m each. To avoid that a faster athlete run a longer section are imposed limits for the passage of the baton. In the image below you can see those takeover zones (red boxes) on a lap 

It is vey difficult to anser withou knowing your "style" and your weight. I try to give you general info: This ski size from Atomic brand shows that ski size for slalom race should be shorter than the racer This table says that you can use ski from 150 to 165 according to your hieght, I can suggest you to choose a ski near to 150cm if you are lighter of near to 165 if you are havier 

I do not know what sport are you talking about so it is difficult to reply. Maybe you can use a swiss-system with variations. I use it for curling tournaments and work in this way (for 12 teams): 

This is the ski-jumping calendar for men competitions in february 2017. Is it possible to view several type of competitions: 

Each starting position is identified by colour and/or number. Colours are determined by qualification ranking (time) in each heat: 

As written on nba website Player Option gives the player the right to extend the length of the contract. Take a look that an unrestricted free agent is able to sign with any team he chooses while a restricted free agent's original team has the chance to keep the player by matching the offer sheet signed with another team. This is known as the "right of first refusal." 

No matter what fins you use, your arm position should never be such that your freestyle recovery is in the water. If the bow wave is high for you, rotate your shoulders more and raise your elbow higher. Your coach should be pointing this out to you. If you are raising your arms, you don't want to be pressing your chest and head down. You may wish to discontinue use of fins, or possibly switch to shorter fins (as per @Phil's comment) in order to focus on your arm stroke. 

The generally accepted solution is to accept that this will happen - you can minimise the risk by kicking the board backward when you bail, but most skaters would rather damage the board than accidentally get hooked up with a leash in traffic, or trip on the leash when trying to bail at speed etc. Boards are meant to take dings anyway. That said, there are some situations when you might want one, so you can use a leash (a little like a surfer's leash, but tightly coiled so it won't go under the trucks, hopefully) but you will look silly and will get harassed by other skaters :-) There was someone who invented a 'dead man's brake' that would stop a longboard quite quickly if your foot came off it, but it didn't catch on. 

But if you have a large swell or rough seas in a light wind, leaving the vang too loose will let your boom bounce up and down, so pull it in enough to stop that happening. 

1500m a day seems a very short distance. My ten year old swims 3500 to 4000m each evening as part of her training. When I was competing in inter-county swimming races in my late teens, I would swim about 5k each evening, and another 1500m each morning. And while I was pretty fast in my county, I was never going to be up at the speed professionals swim At risk of stating the obvious, when you use arms and legs you go much faster than arms or legs alone. This is perfectly normal. 

The player ask for rescission and he will take back "his property". In this case is is free to choose another team and the new team should not pay for the player (see player Iker Casillas moving to Porto from Real Madrid in summer '15) The team sacks the player and the player start to play to another team. In this case the new team has probably pay money to old team, but it depends on the courts where the teams talk about the questions) 

During Rio 2016 Olympic diving events it is easy to observe the athletes prepare with a wet small towel both before and after the dive. After the dive this towel is promptly launched into the pool. What would be the reason for this? 

The most important feature are: a wide lateral vision (so bigger curved lens than normal glasses) and an excellent grip on the head. I can suggest deformable plastic linked to an elastic to wear perfectly (only if you feel comfortable with it). These featuresare not so prevalent because the athletes usually wear contact lenses. Here you can find info on sportglasses (not only for volleyball) and also a commercial link with a lot of example. Those two example with no elastic and elastic solutions to understand better. 

Yesterday (August 18th 2016) Gatlin has touched his mate out of those takeover zone From IAAF rule book rule 170.7 

ATP/WTA tournaments last one week, only Grand Slam ones last two weeks. Tournaments schedule are planned to manage weather problems, sometimes it happened that a player has played two singles match the same day. In history never happened that a Grand Slam tournament was totally abandoned by weather. You can check the list of men and women winners. But it happened that ATP/WTA tournaments delay a lot and the final was played on monday (i.e Wimbledon 1919, 1922, 2001) 

What: if you are talking about "Super Tie-break" the appendix V of ITF rules of tennis you can see info about Match tie-breaks (10 points): this is a tie-break to 10 points, a shorter solutions played instead of third (final) set When: suggested by ITF in 2001, experimental in 2002, it becames a rule from the year 2003 source Applied: it is applied also to double matches (men and women) and also in other tournaments out of Gran Slam circuit: ATP 250 men doubles ATP 500 men doubles ATP Master1000 men doubles 

When I was competing at school I built my own one, and the end result not only felt just like one of the better ones I could buy, it cost me about the same. It also took me a lot of time and effort to ensure the layers were correctly affixed and smoothed. This is a very small statistical sample, but I would suggest buying a nice bat that feels good to you. 

This gives more power, as the sail flattens, and the mast bends, but be ready to slacken it off as the sail overpowers. That basic rule, having your vang tension proportional to the wind strength is an excellent approximation. This allows the sail more power - which is what you want control of in racing. It would be ideal if the helmsman could also work the vang, because you can play the helm, main sheets and vang off against each other, but on a 2 person boat you'd usually have your crew play the vang. Edit: Just found a brief page from Dave Dellenbaugh (an America's Cup veteran) that gives a little more detail on these. 

So, as no-one has answered, I thought I'd pop up some of the info I found in my research. It doesn't seem to matter much whether the leader continues or whether you swap leads, however leading for a couple of pitches and then swapping may get your hand in with placing anchors on that climb. Weigh this up against fatigue. The key piece for all multi-pitch climbs is rope handling at each belay point - this is where some additional techniques and practices come into play: From Petzl's guidance: 

Distance to Finish (DTF) is the simplest and most common way to measure distance in sailing. If you take a Great Circle line (the shortest distance on the surface of the Earth) between the boat and the next mark, buoy or finish, that is the DTF. Once round the next mark, the measurement starts again to the following one. It isn't an accurate indicator of who will actually be in the lead, as it doesn't take into account course made good over tides, winds, upwind sailing capability etc., until the boats are close to the mark/buoy/finish line. Because of this, commentators typically provide analysis based on expectations of positions, and this is especially valuable for long distance races such as the Vendée Globe. They take into account known weather patterns, sea conditions etc. From the Volvo Ocean Race site (emphasis mine): 

This is one of the most controversial boxing matches in history. Some argue that the Alì's punch has not knocked out his opponent, but currently there are no concrete information about it. On wikipedia there is an dedicated page with many info and many hypothesis on this match (also on the possibility that was fixed). So, I think it is not possible to provide a concrete answer to these questions 

Furthermore first ranked competitor from the qualifications can choose their lane, with the second fastest the next lane and so on 

Not the most one, but one of the most important I do not know update statistics on it but in 2010 and 2011 Australia seems one of the most born-Country for foreing NFL players, but it seems there are also many other Country that offers players to NFL. Aslo this top 10 shows: England (1) - Liberia (1) - Estonia (1) - Poland (1)- Japan (1) - Germany (2) - Ghana (1) - Tonga (1) - Canada (1) as born-Country of NFL players 

Gabon national team is qualified because of nation host. The team was insert in Group I and has played friendly against other team of the same Group Wikipedia has insert Gabon in the Group A of qualified teams: The host nation team will also be drawn into a group and will play games against those in that group; however, these matches will only be considered as friendlies and not counted for the standings. 

This is the Olympic Schedule planning of RIO 2016. As you can see there are also other sports like Weightlifting / Taekwondo / Shooting / Judo planned in a single day. I think this is because of structure and techincal reason planning. 

Thinking that the application be referred to the game eights-ball, the Regulation provides that the black ball is pocketed after you holed out his 7 balls. According with World Pool-Billiard Association after having pocketed all their balls 7 is necessary, pocket the 8 ball (hit with the cue ball) in the declared hole. There are several variants of this type of game with special rules, but the standard is what is written above 

As I turn my head to breathe (almost always to the left), I reach my head out to the left. I think this is probably because I am reaching with my right arm, and trying to reach as far as I can is throwing my head out of alignment. I also breathe for too long. It's only like a half second too long, but every half second counts. Also, as I have been pressing my chest and head to get my hips up lately, I have found it increasingly difficult to do a quick, straight breath. What are some drills for these breathing issues? How else can I fix these problems? 

I am trying to fix my head and hip positioning by looking down instead of forward and pressing my chest and / or head down. It's kind of awkward to press your chest down while also looking down and keeping your head at the surface of the water. My friend tells me that I was swimming with my whole body about an inch below the surface. But I'm pretty sure it was faster. In some videos, Phelps looks like he's looking pretty far forward, so I tried to look a little forward and press only my chest. That felt like it really worked to get my hips on the surface and my head at the top, but I was told that my head was still underwater and it also didn't feel quite as fast. It was also hard to press the chest without feeling like I was looking way too far forward. I'm sure I'll get used to this, but when I press my chest down, I feel like I have so much less breath. I'm a sprinter, so it's less of a big deal, but I'm hoping that goes away eventually or is at least normal? Some of the later positions I've tried for head and hip position have made my upper lats through my shoulders through the top of the arm ache/hurt, and this aching is accentuated when I switch to a kickboard for kicking sets. I think I've become lazy in my arm pulls as I work on other technical issues (which may be contributing to this), but part of it I think is that my arm is floating above my head and body so when I rotate and pull the arm, it doesn't have as much power. Thorpe complicates the whole issue because apparently he lets his hips drop a little so he can use his legs to power him along better. What can I do to alleviate these issues and how can I get a better head and hip position for sprinting?
