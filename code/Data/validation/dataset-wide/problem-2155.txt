If you are looking to get permanent in the office, you should definitely focus on improving your relationships with your fellow colleagues as well as your seniors. Going to a trip with them is really a good option for this. Also if letting down half day salary is not gonna cost you much, then you should definitely attend the trip. Also, talking to your senior about working for extra hours to make up for the trip time will definitely show your loyalty towards work and also your half day salary would be saved. So you should definitely go to trip and ask your senior to make up for the half day loss by working in extra hours. 

It will surely convey the boss that the information is being leaked and if it is sensitive enough, you might get some positive results. 

This is a usual scenario in our office. We are a group of 4 trainees seated alongside 3 seniors. we 4 trainees are really good friends . It is usual among us that 2 or 3 of us are involved in conflicting dicsussion. Its been 5 months for us and each time any of us had discussion and if the person sitting quite knows the answer doesnt hesitate much to interrupt the discussion to give their suggestion. But on the other side, if any of our seniors have conversation, even if we know the answer we didn't interrupt them, as long as we are asked to. So i would suggest you to interrupt the X and Y only if you have sound relations with them, otherwise you should wait for them to ask you to answer the topic. Else it will reflects your lack of focus on own work and eye on other's work. 

It is really a brave issue to brought up. But this is really a matter of high concern. If it had happened for the first time, then you should personally talk to that particular girl(obviously when she is not drunk, you cant afford second one). You should clear some points rearding 

Bravo.! That's really a brave question. Its a problem that i think many of us should have faced. The question to this is simple. As you have mentioned, there are only 8 or 9 employees in your office, that means your absence in the office will definitely affect the work. Also, you have mentioned that you are feeling quite better and the disease is not much severe and you will be fine in 2 or 3 days, so you might talk to your boss about the disease and ask him to decrease the workload from you. Even working in weekends for completing the work might do the trick. But all depends on how you presents your illness to your boss. but i must say Never Compromise anything for the Sake of you HEALTH 

Its just fine now to shake hands with your employer and go find a new job. Its a usual thing, that you are having a lot of affection at your current job. I guess everyone loves their first job. But you cant put your career at an edge for the sake of I just love my job. You have just started your career and initial years of your career are very important, you should gain good experience in this time. You can get back to them anytime they are upto their funds and if they can afford you at that time. A new job will definitely provide you with some new friends, whom you will not try to loose at that time. 

Social Networking sites are blocked in our office. So whenever i am free at work, i usually spend much of my time studying my previous assignments, researching about enhancements in the technology on which i am working upon and most of the time in Stack overflow solving others problem. I think its among the best ways to learn about things. But also, you need to find out the reason, why you are not being assigned work, sometimes these reasons could be severe. 

When you do something you regret, what do you do? - First, Confess This sounds more absurd than any other answer, but it might just be a good start. If you are in front of a real recruiter (someone like me) it will actually help you. 1. Understand your self This might be possibly doing it without very conscious thinking but some core reason is driving it. First, try to figure out, what will you now take to make you a good active member in a project and stop all the clutter from my mind when you make career objectives. You need to be clear about what you need now - if that is lacking the recruiter will not bother about your quality now. 2. Prepare your defense It's not always a bad thing. Unlike the popular notion there is really nothing wrong about job hopping - if this is done for the right and good reasons. And among many, the serious reasons could be "misfit of profiles", "serious cultural issue" (though this should be very objective), "company on verge of closing" are actually ok. If you say i took this but then found something "i was too passionate about" - works only if that other thing you carried it through. Of course, when you quote "For better growth options" - should not jump out in few months. 3. Be clear on your objective in resume When many of the times you figure out that prominently there is a X reason for you to jump, and you discover that Y fits for you well; it is better to focus on something complementary. Also, this are the situations where "Objective of the resume" does good job. An objective, something like... 

Ref check of employers is just important as ref checks of employees. Yes, in most cases, when we are dealing with big companies is always available - however, it is not a given that company always is reliable. Personal interview is usually a must; and at least you should know the horizons and path for your career ahead. In a situation like this you should have asked for a personal meet with the proprietor and have one-to-one about what went wrong. May be you could just make a call now! 

While this was not during workplace but during my years of college i used to feel the same way. Generally, issues related to personality, body language, having a good public presence and charm are all linked to something within. I used attend the classes for that, but i think with a special touch from the teacher eventually it turned out this has nothing to do with my language understanding or there wasn't any formula for it. Through my own experience and the others i have seen, essentially, it boils down to two things: 1. Confidence: Once you really has self confidence to face people, accept and respond to what is being told - you slowly realize that your body comes to rhythm; you don't fear to express yourself, to tell truth and you are not conscious and hold back yourself while you are speaking. Tip: have a close friend whom you can trust and keep talking to him/her. Expressing them you would feel much easy and while they should be critical, they should look from your point of view, you will begin to gain the confidence. 2. Clarity of thought: There are others who doesn't really lack confidence, but while they are saying something several threads in their mind go on. The way they present themselves becomes like a spaghetti to reverse. This eventually leads to being upset about not being able to communicate. Tip: Rehearse and rehearse before every important meeting, talk and try to write down stuff. This allows you to look at yourself as the other person and slowly you will improve upon how you express yourself. -- In all, all aspects of personal skills always get more by practice rather than learning some theory about it. Find a buddy whom you think has got it all, and whom you can trust. And keep constant communication to him/her they can guide you how to improve in those small but important things. 

Few candidates actually ask for a higher salary, and I suppose shyness, and fear of appearing greedy, are the major reasons for this. However, you should definitely try to negotiate as high a salary as you can, when you first join your job. This is your most significant chance to try to earn more. But directly asking for I want more money is not good, instead justify yourself to be paid more money. find or develop a role which commands a higher value, and therefore salary. You can do this either and both with your present employer by agreeing wider responsibilities and opportunities for you to contribute to organisational performance and profit, and/or perhaps with a new employer. 

Note- I work in IT company, so you could understand a break's value for a programmer. I work in a company with a 4 floor setup and about 200 employees in the same building, though it is quite a large company with employees in trades other than IT. 

I am quite new to Office environment, so I am not not much familiar with Workplace etiquettes. Our Lunch timings is from 2 pm to 3 pm. But our seniors are mostly busy doing their project stuff at that time and they mostly leave their seats at about 2:30 for Lunch. But I most of the time leave my seat for lunch at exact 2 pm. 

now what do you want.? the information.? or you want that jackass to not get the information.? either way you are helpless. you cant tell your boss to not share any information with that colleague and also asking your boss to share the same information with you also will not help you much. 

I can think of my 2 college friends, who were always together, even when they go for interviews for jobs. They were categorised as couples by our other friends. At last, they broke their friendship. I also have somewhat same scenario as did you, but not this much sever(I am not always with the female friends, even prefer to hang out with my male friends most of the time). I would like to mention few things as said by you, We frequently have chats Now, I would like to mention my scenario. I do have female friends, even I do have daily chats with some of my female friends. I cant remember a single day when we havnt talked. Also with one of my friends, I do have late night conversations. We are best friends and we think its normal among the friends to have frequent chats. We are always together Now about your second point. Whenever, we are together, we are not always alone. and I dont think a purpose of always being alone all the time. We are always in a group. We often go for lunch Now, about the third point. We do go for outings and watch movies. but here also we are in a group 

Thanx to all users, who had given their valuable suggestions. what i had concluded that to boost up my enthusiasm during work, as suggested by @karl beilefeldt 

I was in the same situation in the college days, but in my case, F was really a close frnd, thus it doesnt mattered that F worked or not as much as we did, but F gave the project presentation for us, in that F was really good. In my case, A always try to be a perfectionist, thus he doesnt likes any of the work done by F. Every time, F tries to mark his presence, A always denies F's work, by saying almost the same words that you said The work F did in 4 weeks, i could have probably done in 2 hours. So you better find out the best part of F(Asking a friend to leave the group is quite rude). Even if you want to do that, do it before its too late for F to get in some other project. Have an honest talk with F or even with the project guide.
