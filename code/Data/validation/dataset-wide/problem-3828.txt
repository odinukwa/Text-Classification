Let $X$ be a $C^\infty$-manifold, $Y$ be its $C^\infty$-submanifold. Hörmander defines the set $I^m(X,Y)$ of conormal distributions as the set of all $u \in \mathscr D'(X)$ such that $$ L_1 \ldots L_N u \in {}^{\infty}H^{\mathrm{loc}}_{(-m-n/4)}(X), \quad n = \dim X, $$ for any smooth vector fields $L_1$, $\ldots$, $L_N$ on $X$ that are tangent to $Y$ and for any $N$, where ${}^\infty H^{\mathrm{loc}}_{(-m-n/4)}(X)$ is the Besov space. Is there some practical way to check whether some distribution $u \in \mathscr D'(X)$ is in fact from $I^m(X,Y)$ or I should always check the above inclusions? What are the examples of the most simple nontrivial conormal distributions for general $X$ and $Y$? If I take, e.g. $Y = f^{-1}(0)$ for some smooth submersion $f \colon X \to \mathbb R$ and take some $C^\infty$-density $\mu$ on $Y$ and then define for any $v \in C^\infty_c(X)$ $\langle \delta_\mu, v \rangle = \int_Y v\mu$ is it possible to say that $\delta_\mu \in I^m(X,Y)$ for some $m$? 

Let $f \colon \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$ be a function from the Schwartz class and $f(0) \neq 0$. Define it's projection $g(x) = \langle f(x), \frac{x}{|x|} \rangle \frac{x}{|x|}$, where $\langle a, b\rangle = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2$, $a = (a_1,a_2)$, $b=(b_1,b_2)$. Then $g$ has the same rate of decay at infinity as $f$ but it has discontinuity at zero of special kind. By the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma we conclude that $\hat g(\xi) \to 0$ as $\xi \to \infty$, where $$ \hat g(\xi) = \int\limits_{\mathbb R^2} e^{- i \langle \xi, x \rangle} g(x) \, dx $$ is the Fourier transform of $g$. Is it possible to find an estimation of the decay rate of $\hat g$ in this particular case? Is it possible, for example, to say that for some small $\varepsilon > 0$ we have $(1+|\xi|^2)^{\frac \varepsilon 2} \hat g(\xi) \in L_1(\mathbb R^2)$? I've tried to find the answer in literature on the Fourier transform and to ask on MSE but without success. 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two real-analytic manifolds and $Z \subset X \times Y$ be a real-analytic embedded closed submanifold. Suppose now that $K \in \mathscr D'(X \times Y)$ is a distribution conormal to $Z$, i.e. $K \in I^m(X\times Y,Z)$ for some $m$. It defines the F.I.O. $A_K \colon C^\infty_c(X) \to \mathscr D'(Y)$ such that for any $u \in C^\infty_c(X)$, $v \in C^\infty_c(Y)$ the equality $\langle A_K u, v\rangle = \langle K, u \otimes v \rangle$ holds. If $\dot N^\ast Z \subset \dot T^\ast X \times \dot T^\ast Y$ (dot means the zero section removed) then $A_K \colon C^\infty_c(X) \to C^\infty(|\Lambda|Y)$ and we can extend $A_K$ to $A_K \colon \mathscr E'(X) \to \mathscr D'(Y)$. I would like to estimate the analytical wavefront set $WF_A(u)$ of $u \in \mathscr E'(X)$ given $WF_A(A_Ku)$. Please tell me, are there some related results in literature? UPD. I have realized that I don't have a good answer even in the case of the ordinary $C^\infty$ wavefront set $WF$. Suppose that $A_K$ is proper (hence it maps $\mathscr E'(X) \to \mathscr E'(Y))$ and suppose it has a left parametrix $B$, so that $BA - I_X$ has a $C^\infty$ kernel. Then we can write $$ WF(u) = WF(BA_Ku) \subset C^{-1} \circ WF(A_K u), \quad C = (\dot N^\ast Z)'. $$ This is the desired estimate in the case of $C^\infty$ wavefront set but according to the proof it holds for proper FIOs with left parametrixes. It is possible to say something in the case of nonproper but elliptic FIOs? Does this inclusion still hold? 

This is not a full answer but I'm throwing some observations out. Note that the even stronger inequality also has a clear combinatorial interpretation. Namely, if one denotes by inj(A,B) the set of injections from A to B, then the inequality says that |inj(T,inj(W,V))| > |inj(W,inj(T,V))|. To see this, multiply both sides of the stronger inequality by t!w!. Of course, here t = |T|, w = |W| and v = |V|. In this form, it is easy to believe the inequality. Consider a function $f : T \times W \to V$, thought of as a $t \times w$ matrix with entries in V. It defines an element of the left hand side if there is no repeated entry in any row, and there are no repeated entire rows. The right hand side counts the same thing with columns. We have assumed that the columns are longer than the rows. Then if the entries of the matrix are picked uniformly at random, it should fail to define an element of the right hand side with greater probability, since most functions that fail should do so because of repeated entries in a row/column rather than an entire repeated row/column, and it is more likely to be a repeated entry in a column than in a row. However, I don't see any nice way of producing a proof out of the above heuristic. Bijective proofs seem to get really complicated... 

Craig Westerland suggests an alternative description of the cohomology of $F(\Sigma,G,n)$. The covering $p \colon F(\Sigma,G,n) \to F(\Sigma,n)$ satisfies $R^ip_\ast\mathbf Z =0$ for $i>0$, so $$ H^\bullet(F(\Sigma,G,n),\mathbf Z) = H^\bullet(F(\Sigma,n),p_\ast\mathbf Z). $$ Now $F(\Sigma,n)$ is a $K(\pi,1)$ space where $\pi$ is by definition the pure braid group on $n$ strands of the surface $\Sigma$, $P_n(\Sigma)$. Hence this cohomology is given by $$ H^\bullet(P_n(\Sigma), \mathbf Z [ \mathrm{hom}(\pi_1(\Sigma \setminus \{s_1,\ldots,s_n\},G)/G]).$$ Also the action of $P_n(\Sigma)$ is the restriction of an action of the $n$-strand surface braid group $B_n(\Sigma)$ (i.e. where the points are unordered). The simplest example should be $\Sigma = \mathbf R^2$, where we get the usual pure braid group. Since the fundamental group of the punctured plane is free we find that $\mathrm{hom}(\pi_1(\Sigma \setminus \{s_1,\ldots,s_n\},G)/G = G^n/G$, where $G$ acts by elementwise conjugation on $G^n$. The action of the braid group $B_n$ can be written down in terms of Artin's generators $\sigma_i$: the element $\sigma_i$ acts by $$ (g_1,\ldots,g_i,g_{i+1},\ldots,g_n) \mapsto (g_1,\ldots,g_ig_{i+1}g_i^{-1},g_i,\ldots,g_n)$$ (which is well defined on equivalence classes modulo conjugation). Then I guess even these cohomology groups are hard to compute in general? 

Questions about aesthetics are of course inherently subjective. In your third point you seem to be expressing a strong aesthetic preference for mathematics which starts from a smallish set of axioms and builds a large, unified theory, constructed with maximal generality. I can think of other areas of mathematics than Australian-style category theory that fit this description, like universal algebra, point-set topology, finite group theory, and several areas of set theory and logic. I believe a young mathematician in any of those areas could have posted a similar complaint bemoaning the general drift away from the kind of mathematics they care about. By contrast let me try to articulate how I perceive the dominant aesthetic preference of the mathematical community, without necessarily endorsing it myself. One imagines that there is a "core" of mathematics, consisting perhaps of geometry, arithmetic and analysis. Questions in these areas are inherently interesting and deserve to be studied. Other parts of mathematics deserve to be studied only inasmuch that they can be applied to those core areas. From this perspective HTT is "superior" to Australian style category theory only because it has been more useful in algebraic geometry, K-theory and topology, which are all close to that "core". A more blunt take is that this is memetic evolution in action. In a toy model, all mathematicians start out being interested only in the specific problem assigned to them by their advisor. During their career they'll become interested in more things, determined by randomness, personal preferences, but above all self-interest: "oh, it seems I can maybe prove something about X (which I care about) if I only learn a bit of Y (which I have only heard of)"... Rightly or wrongly, such a process will "reward" areas exclusively on the basis of whether they are useful to other areas, and "punish" those which aren't. So what can you do if you work in an area which is out of vogue? Of course you can advertise your work and your point of view, but you can't force people to care about the theorems you prove. So you have two extreme options: (a) Keep working on what you care about, no matter what others think. This is not easy, but it can be done - you'll just have fewer job opportunities, fewer funding options, etc. Or: (b) Switch fields. This is not easy either, but it can also be done. This is of course easier if you know someone you can collaborate with and learn from, and if you can switch to something reasonably close to your own interests. Most people will maybe do something inbetween - try to nudge their own interests in the direction of things that can be applied to what other people are working on. Good luck. 

In the top picture the optimal selection of circles has been colored blue. In the bottom picture there are two optimal solutions: select the 3 in the top box and the 1 in the right box. Other solution: select the 2 in the top box, the 1 in the left box and the 1 in the right box. My question is: is this solvable in polynomial time, or if not is it possible to approximate it? If the graph is tree structured then dynamic programming can solve the problem, but diamond structures seem to complicate the problem. I have asked this problem on stackoverflow.com, but that doesn't seem to get very far and I thought maybe this is a more appropriate place? 

I am interested in questions of the following form: minimize $H(f)$ given $G(f) = 0$ where $H$ and $G$ are operators of type $X \to R$ where $X = R \to R$. An example is: Minimize $$H(f) = \int_{-1}^1\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}$$ Under the conditions that: $$G(f) = \int_{-1}^1f(x) = \pi/2 $$ $$f(-1) = f(1) = 0$$ That is, find a function f on [-1,1] with area under the curve equal to $\pi/2$, minimizing the path length (the answer to this example is a half-circle $f(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$, I believe). Other examples of operators that can occur in the minimize or in the condition are: $$A(f) = f(1)$$ $$B(f) = \int_a^b E(x,f(x),f'(x))dx $$ (i.e. an integral of an expression containing $x$, $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$). The way to solve these kind of problems seem to be Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces. How does one do this? 

If a circle is selected, then all the boxes it is connected to must be selected. If a box is selected then one of the circles in it must be selected. The primary box is selected. The sum of the numbers in the selected circles is minimal. 

Let's start with a picture: $URL$ What you see here are boxes and circles inside the boxes. Each circle is connected to zero or more boxes. One box is the primary box, it's the grey one. Here is another example (the top box is the primary box): $URL$ (I apologize for the crappy drawings). The goal is to select a subset of all circles such that: 

Suppose we have a countable set S with a total order. Can we give an injection from S to the set of finite binary sequences that end in all zeros that preserves the ordering? The order on binary sequences is the dictionary ordering (e.g. 001001 <= 01). For a finite set this is easy: arrange the set in order and assign an increasing sequence of binary sequences. For the natural numbers this is also easy: send a number n to the sequence that starts with n ones (a similar solution works for negative numbers). For the rationals this is already a bit more difficult. I believe the following works: Take the Stern-Brocot tree. Start at the root and walk down to the rational number. Every time you go left, write a 0. Every time you go right, write a 1. Finally write another 1. So an equivalent formulation seems to be: can we arrange S into a binary tree such that the elements are arranged in order from left to right as in the Stern-Brocot tree. My question is: can this be done for any countable set with a total order? The question came up in a discussion whether radix sort can be used to sort any set (radix sort can sort binary sequences). 

The assumption on the fibers is equivalent to that $R^qf_! \phi$ vanishes unless $q = q_0$. Hence there is only one nonzero row in the $E_2$ page of the spectral sequence, which happens so often that there is a special name for this situation: the spectral sequence collapses at $E_2$. Collapsing is stronger than both degenerating and converging. In particular, if you know that a spectral sequence collapses, then you can read off the actual cohomology groups that the sequence converges to and not just their respective associated gradeds. All this follows because no maps after the $E_1$ page send the nonzero row to itself, so there can be no nonzero differentials; moreover, the filtration on each $H^i$ of the $H^\ast$ that the sequence converges to has at most one step (corresponding to the nonzero row), so each $H^i$ is simply given by the corresponding entry in the nonzero row. This should be explained in any reference on spectral sequence, e.g. Weibel's "An introduction to homological algebra". 

Let $A_g$ denote the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$. For any partition of $g$, one can consider the corresponding locus inside $A_g$ of products of lower-dimensional abelian varieties. My question is: can one describe explicitly the closure of this locus in (some) compactification? I guess part of this question is what compactification one should use. For instance, if one simply chooses a toroidal compactification $\widetilde{A}_g$, one can also extend the universal family to a family of semistable abelian varieties. Can one describe necessary and sufficient conditions for a semistable abelian variety at the boundary for it to be in the closure of such a product locus? Or perhaps if one restricts attention to rank-one degenerations, so it does not depend on a choice of toroidal compactification? Alternatively, one could choose a point in the closure of $A_g$ inside Alexeev's space of stable semi-abelic pairs -- are there necessary and sufficient conditions in this situation? 

${}$Hi André, the situation is in fact worse than what Oscar is telling you: the expression $$ \text{"}\!\wedge^{\mathrm{top}} \Gamma(\Omega_\Sigma^{1/2})\text{ "}$$ doesn't even define a line bundle! If $S_g$ is the moduli stack of spin Riemann surfaces, $p \colon C \to S_g$ is the universal curve, and $L$ is the universal spin line bundle over $C$, then $R^0p_\ast L$ is just a constructible sheaf (not a vector bundle). This is because $h^0(\Omega_{\Sigma}^{1/2})$ isn't a locally constant function on the moduli stack. So you can't apply "$\wedge^{\mathrm{top}}$" to $R^0p_\ast L$. (Compare to how $\wedge^{\mathrm{top}}$ doesn't define a functor from vector spaces to vector spaces.) Maybe what you want is to work with something like the formal difference $R^0p_\ast L \ominus R^1 p_\ast L$, which does have constant rank. 

I disagree with the premise of your question, but maybe I just do not understand it. When points collide (in the world of stable curves) a new component "bubbles off" - in other words, there is no difference between points colliding and the $\mathbb P^1$ breaking. So I think that if you want to understand degenerations of your curve in terms of what happens to the branch configuration "downstairs" then I think you should be looking at the theory of admissible covers. If your 6-pointed $\mathbb P^1$ breaks into two pieces with three markings on each, then an admissible double cover branched at these points will have branching also at the node, so you get two elliptic curves glued at a point. If instead you have one piece with two markings and one with four, then the inverse image of the 2-pointed component is a $\mathbb P^1$ and the inverse image of the 4-pointed component is genus one curve, and these are now glued to each other at two points. This curve is not stable, but we can stabilize it, and we get an elliptic curve glued to itself. Finally, what kind of explicit families are you looking for? Do you want to write them down in coordinates? And what is a "high-dimensional base" here -- a base of dimension more than 3 (= the dimension of the moduli space of genus two curves) seems a bit silly, right? Edit. I just remembered a reference that may be useful for you: there is a paper of Avritzer and Lange in which they go through in detail why a stable hyperelliptic curve is the same as a an admissible double cover of a stable $(2g+2)$-pointed genus zero curve.
