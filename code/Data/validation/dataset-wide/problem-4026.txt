No, these are all. The edge graph of the octahedron has no $K_4$ subgraph, so you have to add a new edge to make a triangulation. The only possible places for a new edge are connecting opposite vertices. You can only add one such edge, as any two meet in their interior. So every triangulation of the octahedron (without new vertices) adds exactly one of the three edges $e$ between opposite vertices. The only $K_4$'s in that graph are the four tetrahedra arranged around $e$, so any traingulation using $e$ must use a subset of those tetrahedra. We need all of them to fill in the octahedron. 

I don't know if this is the kind of answer which will satisfy. Write $f$ for the function on $\mathbb{C} - \Lambda$ and $z$ for the coordinate on $\mathbb{C}$. Write $D^{\ast}$ for the punctured disc. Forstneric and Ohsawa show we can take $f$ to be of finite order as $z \to 0$, meaning $|f| < \exp(z^{-N})$ for some $N$. Put $f' = g$, so $g$ is a nowhere vanishing function on $D^{\ast}$ and also of finite order. Let $k$ be the winding number of $g'$ as we travel around $0$, so $z^{-k} g$ has a logarithm on $D^{\ast}$, say $g = z^k e^{h(z)}$. Then $|h| < z^{-N}$ so $h$ is meromorphic. Say $h(z) = c z^{-n} + \cdots$. Undoing the changes of variable, $f = \int z^k \exp(c z^{-n} + \cdots)$. This integral has different behavior on the sectors where $c z^{-n}$ lies in the left or the right half plane. If we fix $\theta \in (0, \pi/2)$ and consider the $n$ wedges where $\arg(c)-n \arg(z) \in (-\theta, \theta)$, then we have an asymptotic series starting $- \tfrac{z^{k+2n+1}}{c (n+1)} \exp(c z^{-n})$. So, for $z = r e^{i \phi}$ with $\phi$ ranging through each of these wedges, $f$ swings around a circle of large radius, roughly $r^{-n}$ times. Meanwhile, if $\arg(c)-n \arg(z) \in (\pi-\theta, \pi+\theta)$, then $f'$ is very small, so $f$ stays very near some limiting value. I don't know whether it is the same limiting value in the $n$ different wedges, I don't see why it should be. It circles that value roughly $r^{-n}$ times. However, I am not claiming that I understand the behavior near the $2n$ rays where $\arg(c)-n \arg(z) \in \{0, \pi \}$ well enough to subtract off these numbers of criclings from each other. 

You should say what bundle you are taking Chern/Segre classes of. (As diverietti points out, knowledge of the two is equivalent.) Some people use "Chern class of $X$" to mean "Chern class of the tangent bundle to $X$." If this is what you mean, then no, because you haven't incorporated the data of the embedding. Alternatively, you could mean the classes of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ restricted from projective space. In this case, there is only one nonzero Chern class, $c_1$, and the Segre classes are $s_k = (-c_1)^k$. So all you can see is $\int_X (c_1)^{\dim X}$, better known as $\deg X$. This is equivalent to knowing the first term of the Hilbert polynomial, but no more. If you know $c_1(\mathcal{O}(1))$ and you know the Chern (or Segre) classes of $T_X$, then yes! This is the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula. ADDED We have a short exact sequence of vector bundles on $X$: $0 \to T_X \to T_{\mathbb{P}^n}|_X \to N_{X/\mathbb{P}^n} \to 0$. So $c(T_X) c(N_{X/\mathbb{P}^n}) = c(T_{\mathbb{P}^n})$ (where $c$ is the total Chern class). Remembering that $s(E) c(E) = 1$, with $s$ the total Segre class, we have $$c(T_X) = c( T_{\mathbb{P}^n}) s(N_{X/\mathbb{P}^n}).$$ Writing $H$ for the hyperplane class $c_1(\mathcal{O}(1))$, we have $c(T_{\mathbb{P}^n}) = (1+H)^{n+1} - H^{n+1}$. So knowing the degree of $X$ and the Segre class of the normal bundle determines the Chern classes of the tangent bundle. There may be some further simplification that can be performed, but I don't see it right now. 

With the problem as stated, the answer is $n-k+1$. Take the uniform matroid of rank $1$ on $n-k+1$ elements and direct sum with $k-1$ co-loops. (Geometrically, take the standard basis $e_1$, $e_2$, ..., $e_k$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ and duplicate the first basis element $n-k+1$ times.) To see that this is optimal, suppose for the sake of contradiction that we could achieve $n-k$ bases: $B_1$, $B_2$, ..., $B_{n-k}$. Consider the exchange graph, where $B_i$ and $B_j$ are connected by an edge if $\#(B_i \setminus B_j)= \#(B_j \setminus B_i) = 1$. It is known to be connected. Reorder the $B_i$ such that the induced subgraph on $B_1$, $B_2$, ..., $B_r$ is connected. Then, for $2 \leq r \leq n-k$, there is at most one element of $B_r$ not in $\bigcup_{1 \leq i<r} B_i$. We deduce that $\# \bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq n-k} B_i \leq \# B_1 + (n-k-1) = n-1$. So there is some element not in $\bigcup B_i$, and this element is not independent. As I commented above, I think it would be more natural to impose that $M$ has neither loops nor co-loops. The best I can find for that problem $k(n-k)$, by using $U(k-1,k) \oplus U(1, n-k)$, where $U(r,m)$ is the uniform matroid of rank $r$ on $m$ elements. If you ask for the matroid to be connected, I can achieve $k(n-k)+1$ by starting with $U(k,k+1)$ and replacing one element with $n-k$ parallel copies. I would guess these are optimal. 

This should be impossible, for basically the reason you describe in your Motivation. Note that, if things worked the way you wanted, not only would the numerical intersection $(\psi^* K_Y, E)$ be zero, but the actual class of $\psi^* K_Y$ in $\mathrm{Pic}(E)$ would also be zero. Suppose that $Y$ has one singular point, at $x$; that $\rho: Y' \to Y$ is a resolution and that $\rho^{-1}(x)$ is a single curve $E$. Then, by adjunction, $K_E = (K_{Y'} + E)|_E$. Also, $\psi^* K_Y = K_{Y'} + r E$ for some integer $r$. So $\psi^* K_Y |_E = (K_E + (r-1) E)|_E$. If things worked the way you wanted, this class would be zero. So we'll get a counter-example if we can set things up so that $K_E$ is not a multiple of $\mathcal{O}(E)|_E$ in $\mathrm{Pic}(E)$. Start with $E$ a curve of genus $\geq 2$. Choose $L$ any negative degree line bundle so that $K_E$ is not a multiple of $[L]$ in $\mathrm{Pic}(E)$. Let $Y'$ be the total space of $L$, and let $Y$ be $Y'$ with $E$ blowndown. (We can do this because we used a negative degree line bundle.) If I'm not confused, this should be a counter-example. 

What about $\mathbb{Z} \cup \{ - \infty \}$? Here $- \infty$ is less than everything, and $\mathbb{Z}$ has the usual order. You probably want some sort of descending chain condition, to rule this out. 

This is a little awkward to answer, because $I_m$ isn't crystallographic for $m \not \in \{2,3,4,6 \}$, which makes it unclear how to normalize the lengths of the roots. Let $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ be the simple roots and $\alpha_1^{\vee}$ and $\alpha_2^{\vee}$ be the corresponding co-roots. Let $d_i$ be the positive real scalar $\alpha_i^{\vee}/\alpha_i$. Then the matrix of inner products $\alpha_i^{\vee}(\alpha_j)$ is $$\begin{bmatrix} 2 & - 2 d_1 d_2^{-1} \cos(\pi/m) \\ -2 d_1^{-1} d_2 \cos(\pi/m) & 2 \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ In the crystallographic cases, one makes the unique (up to switching $d_1$ and $d_2$, and up to rescaling both simultaneously) choice of $d_i$ which makes this matrix have integer entries; this corresponds to making the lattice $\mathrm{Span}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$ be invariant under the reflection action. These are the matrices you listed above. For $m \not \in \{ 2,3,4,6 \}$, no choice of $d_i$ has this property. When $m$ is odd, it is natural to take $d_1=d_2$, because we would like to have $w_0 \alpha_i = -\alpha_{3-i}$ where $w_0$ is the longest element. When $m$ is even, I know of no natural normalization. 

I will show that the eigenvalues of $X_{k+1}$ lie in the interval $[-k, k]$. Since Florian has already given a nice proof that the eigenvalues are integers, this answers your question. Lemma: Let $A$ be a symmetric matrix with nonnegative entries whose rows and columns all add up to $k$. Then, for any real vector $v$, we have $-k \langle v,v \rangle \leq \langle v, Av \rangle \leq k \langle v, v \rangle$. Proof: For any vector $v$, we have $$\langle v, Av \rangle = k \sum v_i^2 - \sum_{i<j} A_{ij} (v_i-v_j)^2 \leq k \sum v_i^2 = k \langle v,v \rangle$$ as desired. The equality $\langle v, Av \rangle = -k \sum v_i^2 + \sum_{i<j} A_{ij} (v_i+v_j)^2$ proves the other direction. $\square$ Now, the matrix of $X_{k+1}$ acting on the regular representation clearly obeys the conditions of the lemma. Taking $v$ to be an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda$, we deduce that $-k \leq \lambda \leq k$, as desired. 

The point of this answer is to spell out the details behind Prof. Elkies statement that "If we change variables from $x$ to $\log_4(\log(1/x))$, we get in the limit an odd periodic oscillation of period 1". In other words, if we write $x = \exp(- 4^{-y})$, then, as $y \to \infty$, the function $f(x)$ approaches a periodic function. Fix $y \in \mathbb{R}$. We'll study the limit of $f(\exp(-4^{-M-y}))$ as $M \to \infty$ through integers. $$\begin{array}{rcl} f(\exp(4^{-M+y})) &=& \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \exp(-4^{k-M-y}) - \exp(- 4^{k-M-y+1/2}) \\ &=& \sum_{j=-M}^{\infty} \exp(-4^{j-y}) - \exp(4^{j-y+1/2}). \\ \end{array}$$ Setting $h(y) = \exp(-4^{-y}) - \exp(-4^{-y+1/2})$, we see that $$\lim_{M \to \infty} f(\exp(4^{-M+y})) = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} h(y+j) =: g(y).$$ The function $h$ decays rapidly as $y \to \pm \infty$, so the sum converges. Here is a plot of $h$: 

Here is an observation that didn't get me very far. Let $p$ have degree $n$ and have $r$ distinct roots, all on the unit circle. Call these roots $e^{i \theta_j}$, where $\theta_k$ has multiplicity $c_j$. Set $$q(u) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^r \left( c_j \left( u + e^{i \theta_j} \right) \prod_{\substack{1 \leq k \leq r \\ k \neq j}} \left( u - e^{i \theta_k} \right) \right).$$ Then $q$ is a monic polynomial of degree $r$, all of whose roots are on the unit circle. They occur at precisely the places where $|p(e^{i \phi})|$ has a local maximum. Your goal is to show that, at one of these local maxima, we have $|p| \geq 2^{n/r}$. I had a detailed computation of this written out, but I couldn't find a way to make it useful, so I'm recording the formula in case it helps someone else. My plan was to show that $\prod_{\{\phi : q(e^{i \phi})=0\}} |p(e^{i \phi})| \geq 2^n$, but this inequality turned out to be false; if all the $\theta$'s are very close together, then one of the local maxima of $p$ is near $2^n$ but the other local maxima can be arbitrarily small. 

Note that the Annoying Lemma is false if we ask for $\gamma_i - \gamma_{i+1}$ to be a simple root. For example, write dominant $GL_3$ weights as partitions in the usual way and take $\beta = (3,2,1)$ and $\delta = (2,2,2)$. Then the Lemma is true, because $\beta - \delta = (1,0,-1)= \alpha_1 + \alpha_2$ is a positive root. However, either of the two sequences $(\beta, \beta-\alpha_1, \delta)$ or $(\beta, \beta-\alpha_2, \delta)$ has a non-dominant element in the middle (namely, $(2,3,1)$ and $(3,1,2)$ respectively.) Proof of $K_{\lambda \mu} \geq K_{\lambda (\lambda - \sigma)}$ assuming the Annoying Lemma: We immediately reduce to the case that the Dynkin diagram is connected. Also, the $SL_2$ case is immediate, so we assume we are not in it. With those reductions made, $\rho-\sigma$ is dominant. Since $\lambda$ is regular dominant, we have that $\lambda - \rho$ is domininant, so $\lambda - \sigma$ is dominant. We may therefore apply the Annoying Lemma to obtain a chain $\gamma_0 = \lambda - \sigma$, $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, ..., $\gamma_N = \mu$ where $\gamma_i - \gamma_{i+1} \in \Phi^+$. It is enough to show that $K_{\lambda \gamma_{i+1}} \geq K_{\lambda \gamma_{i}}$. Restrict to the $SL_2$ corresponding to $\pm (\gamma_i - \gamma_{i+1})$. Then the weights $\gamma_i$ and $\gamma_{i+1}$ lie on the same $SL_2$ string, and the condition that they are both dominant says that $\gamma_{i+1}$ lies nearer the center than $\gamma_i$, so $K_{\lambda \gamma_{i+1}} \geq K_{\lambda \gamma_{i}}$ as desired. $\square$ Proof that $K_{\lambda (\lambda - \sigma)} = \#(\mbox{number of Coxeter elements})$. We recall the BGG resolution $$0 \leftarrow V_{\lambda} \leftarrow M_{\lambda} \leftarrow \bigoplus_{i} M_{\lambda - (\langle \alpha_i^{\vee}, \lambda \rangle +1) \alpha_i} \leftarrow \cdots$$ where $M_{\kappa}$ is the Verma module with highest weight $\kappa$. Since $\lambda$ is regular dominant, $\langle \alpha_i^{\vee}, \lambda \rangle \geq 1$ and thus $\lambda - \sigma = \lambda - \sum_j \alpha_j$ is not a weight of $M_{\lambda - (\langle \alpha_i^{\vee}, \lambda \rangle +1) \alpha_i}$. So the multiplicity of $\lambda - \sigma$ in $V_{\lambda}$ is the same as in $M_{\lambda}$; that is to say, it is the multiplicity of $-\sigma$ as a weight of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{n}_-$. Let $e_1$, $e_2$, ..., $e_n$ be the Chevalley generators of $\mathfrak{n}_-$. Then $U(\mathfrak{n}_-)$ is generated by the $e_i$ modulo the Chevalley-Serre relations. We see that a monomial in the $e_i$ is of degree $\sigma$ if and only if it uses each $e_i$ once, and the only Serre relations in such low degree are those of the form $e_i e_j = e_j e_i$ when $A_{ij} =0$. So the multiplicity of $-\sigma$ as a weight of $U(\mathfrak{n}_+)$ is the number of permutations of $e_1$, ..., $e_n$, up to interchanging commuting elements; this is precisely the description of the Coxeter elements. (It is also not hard to directly prove, using for example PBW bases, that the number is $2^{n-1}$, but I thought this was more fun.) The annoying Lemma in Type A This paper by Matthew Fayers asserts the Annoying Lemma in type A as Proposition 2.3 but leaves the proof to the reader. Prop 1.2 of this paper is the same application that I intended -- showing that if $\mu \geq \nu$ and $\mu$ and $\nu$ are both dominant then $K_{\lambda \mu} \leq K_{\lambda \nu}$. I have completed Fayer's exercise but am delaying posting the solution in hopes that I'll find a less messy one that works for all types. 

"Does that mean we can't really say anything about the ring of regular functions of a quasi-projective variety?" Since every variety contains an open affine, the ring of regular functions is always a subring of a finitely generated ring. (I assume that you consider varieties to be integral.) This is a nontrivial restriction. Also, the ring of regular functions will be noetherian, since any infinite ascending chain of ideals would give an infinite descending chain of subschemes. Wrong, see below. 

Adding one more observation: $D$ is an integral domain. Proof The kernel of a bounded operator is always closed, so all the nonzero elements of $D$ have no kernel and are thus injective. The composition of two injective maps is injective, and hence has no kernel. $\square$ 

You might be interested in Weyl's Integration Formula. There are versions of this for all compact Lie groups; I'll state it for the unitary group. Let $f$ be a conjugacy invariant function on $U(n)$. A unitary matrix always has eigenvalues of the form $(e^{i \theta_1}, e^{i \theta_2}, \ldots, e^{i \theta_n})$, and $f$ is a symmetric function of $(\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n)$. Then 

I get the following counterexample: Let $H$ be the graph on $12$ vertices, called $u_1$, $u_2$, ..., $u_{6}$, $v_1$, $v_2$, ..., $v_{6}$ with the following edges: $(u_i, u_j)$ and $(v_i, v_j)$ for all $1 \leq i < j \leq 6$, and $(u_1, v_1)$. Let the additional edge $e$ connect $(u_2, v_2)$. The graph $H$ has $1,679,616$ spanning trees; $H \cup \{ e \}$ has $4,478,976$ spanning trees. We have $$1679616 < \binom{24}{11} < \binom{25}{11} < 4478976.$$ To find this, I guessed that the counterexample would involve a graph that had two very dense components, connected by only a few edges, one of which was $e$. I then used Mathematica to experiment with the size of the two complete graphs at the ends until it found a counterexample. Replacing $6$ with higher numbers seems to give many more counterexamples. 

The optimal growth rate is $\tau:= (1+\sqrt{5})/2$. Specifically, for any $\epsilon>0$, there are infinitely many integer valued polynomials bounded by $(\tau+\epsilon)^n$, but only finitely many below $(\tau-\epsilon)^n$. The first part of this answer (written first) proves the finiteness; the second uses Noam Elkies' idea combined with a theorem of Fekete to prove the infinitude. 

To amplify Greg Muller's answer, introductory courses in algebraic geometry tend to have a lot of definitions and wave vaguely at motiviation. So students starting out in the field often want to find "native speakers" who can help them understand how everything fits together. I'm sure that founder effect is also a big factor, as JSE suggests. 

You've probably seen this before, but in case you haven't: Let $M$ be a compact oriented manifold. Let $\Omega^k$ be the smooth $k$-forms, let $Z^k$ be the closed $k$-forms and let $B^k$ be the exact $k$-forms. So $H^k=Z^k/B^k$. As Johannes's answer shows, $\ast$ does not carry $Z^k$ to $Z^{n-k}$, nor $B^k$ to $B^{n-k}$. (For an example of the latter, take $S^1$ with its usual metric, and $f:S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ any non constant function. Then $df = f'(\theta) d \theta$ is exact, but $\ast(df) = f'(\theta)$ is not. ) So you cannot define a map $H^k \to H^{n-k}$ in your naive way. We can put an inner product on $\Omega^k$ by $\langle \omega, \eta \rangle = \int_M \omega \wedge \ast(\eta)$. If we pretend that everything works like finite dimensional vector spaces (and the hard part of Hodge theory is justifying this), then $\Omega^k$ splits into $B^k \oplus (B^*)^k \oplus A^k$. Here $(B^*)^k$ is $(Z^k)^{\perp}$ and $A^k = (B^k \oplus (B^*)^k)^{\perp}$. The space $A^k$ is the harmonic forms. Notice that $Z^k = A^k \oplus B^k$, so $H^k = Z^k/B^k \cong A^k$. Hodge star takes $A^k \to A^{n-k}$, $B^k \to (B^*)^{n-k}$ and $(B^*)^k \to B^{n-k}$. So $B^k$ doesn't go to $B^{n-k}$ and $Z^k = A^k \oplus B^k$ doesn't go to $Z^{n-k} = A^{n-k} \oplus B^{n-k}$, making your naive strategy not work. But we do have $Z^k/B^k \cong A^k \to A^{n-k} \cong Z^{n-k}/B^{n-k}$, giving us the Hodge map.
