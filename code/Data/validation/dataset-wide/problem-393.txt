Humans like to settle where there are good natural resources nearby that can aid them. If these resources are plentiful enough, more humans will move in. The settlement becomes a village, then a town, and finally a city. What are these so-called "resources" that I've been talking about? Well, they can be a wide variety of things - open land, good sources of natural food and water, good ways for transportation, etc. One resource that combines all of these is a waterway. It could be a river, a stream, an ocean - anything you can dream up. What are the benefits of a waterway? Well, a waterway satisfies a few of humanity's simplest needs: 

Society That was most likely not at all what you were looking for, so I'll try to devote a bit to the societal aspects of gills. Fishing is big. One of the issues with fishing is that it requires tools. tools didn't come about for some time (although obviously Neanderthals, homo sapiens and possibly homo heidelbergensis had them). If you don't have tools and want to fish, you have to use your hands, which is pretty hard. Gills mean that you still have to sue your hands, but you can follow fish underwater. Have you ever seen someone (actually, Gollum might be a good example) try to catch a fish with their hands, miss, and stumble around in futility trying to get it? Gills mean you can follow the fish underwater. True, this is of no use in the shallows, but you can go into open water, which beats standing in a river looking like a fool with no fishing rod. However, these are homo sapiens, and so have tools. Even something as unwieldy as a large stick can be helpful. Really, you just have to spear a fish, and if it's pointy enough, you're good. The problem comes when you want to catch bigger fish. You'll want to use your gills to your advantage, and the way to do that would be to go out into the open ocean - well, perhaps simply a bay - and go for something more like a swordfish. So you'll need something more than a simple spear. In this case, you're not going to be able to just catch the fist (I've never tried to catch a swordfish, with or without a fishing rod, but it's definitely not easy). the best technique here might be to stab it until it dies. Perhaps you could use a tooth from, say, a shark and repeatedly whack it. Or maybe you just get a few pointy sticks and try to attack it with them. Either way, though, you'll have to realize that you can't catch the fish while it's still alive. The risk will be large, but the reward will be huge! Escapes are easier. I'm not a fan of swimming, and while I know that many people are, some animals aren't. Some large animals don't like water, and if those large animals are after you, you might have a place to hide! Let's say you have a creature like a cat (remember, a lot of cool creatures died out over the past tens of thousands of years) that's following you. It can climb trees and run really quickly . . . but it hates water. The way to get it off your tail would be to jump in a river/lake. Normally, you'd drown as it watched and waited. But with gills, you can stay there for a long time, and be just fine. Bridges I'm guessing that the majority of the time you see a bridge, it's to carry people over a body of water. That's what the earliest bridges would have been for: To get people from point A to point B without having to swim. If you have gills, this isn't a problem anymore; you can swim for long distances. Well, I suppose "long" is a relative term, but you could probably get a good half mile without any problems whatsoever. Carrying freight makes things a bit more interesting. Do you really want to carry an object that runs on electricity underwater? So there are two options: 

On the inside of the cylinder - not the caps - the Coriolis force won't have any "horizontal" effects on the flow of rivers. Maybe you're not convinced. Consider the Coriolis acceleration on Earth's equator. There's no horizontal component to the acceleration, right? Well, on the cylinder, the edge of every cross-section is like the equator, at the same distance from the axis. 

On Earth, the presence of tides due to the Sun and Moon influence certain currents and other movements of water. This in turn leads to different forms of erosion, which can transform a landscape. I'm working on a moon that's tidally locked to a planet - pretty much identical to the Earth-Moon system, except that the moon is slightly more massive, and has an atmosphere, water, and life (thanks in part to a magnetic field). How will the tidal locking - meaning a lack of tides - influence the geography of this moon? Will erosion rates be different? Will that land be shaped differently? 

Figure out where it is. This is the crucial bit. You need to know its position, mass, velocity, orbit, size, density, and composition, and perhaps one or two other parameters. These are crucial, especially the first three. You'll need all this data to model its orbit and what will happen when you deal with it. Now, you might not have time to launch a probe to it (or divert another probe near it), so you'll have to make some educated guesses. If you can get good images of it, you should be able to figure out its size, position, and velocity. Predict its future. You'll need a lot more than a crystal ball for this. Create a computer model (multiple ones for different scenarios, if possible) that predicts its orbit, both past and future. Create a model depicting the solar system, and put in the asteroid. Then you can figure out its closest approach to Earth in the near future. Take some measurements from this model, especially concerning its position and velocity at a certain time. Start building. Unless you're a Jedi, you won't be able to move this thing with just the power of your mind. You'll have to send something up there to do something about the asteroid. Either retrofit an existing rocket or build one from the ground up (though again, you may not have time to start from scratch) and make sure it is capable of delivering objects beyond Earth orbit. Also, create a payload. This is going to be the thing that will interact with the asteroid. Launch. At the proper time, launch the rocket and its payload. Make sure the payload isn't injected into Earth orbit; if this happens, it will be useless. The craft must escape from Earth's gravity if it wants to do anything. This is the only way to get it near the asteroid. Interact with the asteroid. This is a bit of a broad title, but there are few different approaches you could take. I would ram the asteroid with the craft to transfer momentum and change the asteroid's orbit. This would have to be done with extreme precision, though. Ram it at just the wrong velocity and it could miss Earth by thousands of miles. Continue taking data. I almost forgot - make sure you have a backup craft (and rocket). Lots of things could go wrong along the way, and if you're out to destroy civilization, you need a contingency plan. Even if you manage to hit the asteroid, you could have hit it too hard or too softly. Be prepared to launch again to correct the orbit. Anyway, keep collecting data from the asteroid. You'll get better information as it nears Earth, which could help you if you need a second launch. If you have a lander on the asteroid, that could be a great source. Alternatively, have part of the spacecraft continue to do a flyby with the asteroid while the other half impacts. Wait. There isn't a lot you can do from here. Just sit back, relax, and get your affairs in order. If something has gone wrong, though, make sure you have redundancy and go back to step 4. Or step 3, if you have the time and completely forgot. 

How much gold are we talking about? Well, let's use the approximation $$\Delta V\approx4\pi r^2\Delta r$$ If $r$ is about the radius of Earth and $\Delta r$ is $1\text{ meter}$, then $\Delta V\approx5\times10^{14}\text{ m}^3$. The density of gold is $\rho\approx19320\text{ kg/m}^3$, and so $\Delta m=\rho\Delta V\approx10^{19}\text{ kg}$. Let's say that the cloud of material expands isotropically outward from the source with a total mass $M$, radius $R$ (at a given time) and a thickness $\Delta R$. It therefore has a volume $$V\approx4\pi R^2\Delta R$$ and an area mass density of $$\sigma=\frac{M}{4\pi R^2}$$ The planet has a cross-section of $A=\pi r^2$,1 meaning that the total amount of mass that hits the planet is $$\Delta m=\sigma A=\sigma\pi r^2=\frac{1}{4}M\frac{r^2}{R^2}$$ If we set this equal to our earlier value of $\Delta m$, then we find $$\frac{M}{R^2}\approx10^6\text{ kg/m}^2$$ The typical amount of gold produced in a kilonova via the r-process is . . . not well-known. We've got a limited dataset. That said, if we assume (conservatively!) that $M\approx100M_{\oplus}$, then we need $R\approx2\times10^{9}\text{ m}$, or roughly $0.01\text{ AU}$. The planet would almost certainly be in orbit around the binary system, which could be dangerously close. I certainly wouldn't want to be anywhere nearby! Things you could do to solve the problem You do have some options here: 

Short answer You have the two equations you need on the linked page under the heading "Stage two": $$r_i=\sqrt{\frac{L_{\text{star}}}{1.1}},\quad r_o=\sqrt{\frac{L_{\text{star}}}{0.53}}$$ where $r_i$ and $r_o$ are the inner and outer radii of the habitable zone, in astronomical units and $L_{\text{star}}$ is the star's luminosity, in solar luminosities. In your case, then, with $L_{\text{star}}=1.05L_{\odot}$, we have $$r_1=\sqrt{\frac{1.05}{1.1}}=0.978\text{ AU},\quad r_o=\sqrt{\frac{1.05}{.053}}=1.408\text{ AU}$$ LSerni's answer has already done these calculations. But where do those parameters, $1.1$ and $0.53$, come from? The page states that they are "constant value(s) representing stellar flux" at those radii. I believe that they are values of a parameter denoted $S_{eff}$, the effective solar flux (see an updated version in Kopparapu et al. (2013)), the value required to make the solar constant, the flux density on a certain surface, lead to a specific stable surface temperature. $S_{eff}$, according to this new paper (I cannot find the text of the cited book, so I'm looking at a newer version of the analysis), depends on the effective temperature of the star ($T_{eff}$) and four constants ($a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$). These four constants determine what kind of a planet will develop. The specific equation is $$S_{eff}=S_{eff,\odot}+aT_*+bT_*^2+cT_*^3+dT_*^4$$ where $T_*=T_{eff}-5780\text{ K}$. $5780\text{ K}$ is, of course, the effective temperature of the Sun - and you can check that $S_{eff}=S_{eff,\odot}$ when $T_{eff}=5780\text{ K}$. The paper then derives Equation (3): $$r=\sqrt{\frac{L_{\text{star}}/L_{\odot}}{S_{eff}}}\text{ AU}$$ The values $S_{eff}=1.1$ and $S_{eff}=0.53$ correspond, I believe, to two sets of choices for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ and some $T_{eff}$. The paper gives examples in Table 3. I do not know the values chosen to yield the inner and outer values of $S_{eff}$. I do, though, invite you to play around with the constants. Keep in mind that they should all be relatively small, and that they are good for "nice" values of $T_{eff}$ - specifically, for $2600\text{ K}\leq T_{eff}\leq7200\text{ K}$. Long answer So, habitable zone calculations are a pain. For a start, most habitable zone calculations make some key assumptions: 

After a particularly large bombing raid during a war, a mountainous rural region is left mostly destroyed. Villages are in ruins, bands of survivors look everywhere for food and shelter, and all hope seems lost. The government of the small country has collapsed, and anarchy reins. Then one inquisitive young boy finds a network of caves in one of the mountains. It seems like it can hold a large number of people rather comfortably. Some villagers set out to explore it, and over a period of a few weeks, people start using the caves as places to live, safe from the continued bombing runs. There's a river there, complete with fish for food. One day, a bomb causes an avalanche, which causes the only entrance to the cave network to cave in. People frantically try to find ways out, but to no avail. Eventually, it is decided to "keep calm and carry on" while a few explorers try to see if somewhere in the depths lies a previously unknown way out. Everyone staying behind need a few necessities, such as heat and light. They can make fire easily, and they have raw materials (e.g. enough wood to make about fifty homes, which is what the wood is currently being used for), but they need electricity to properly work the lighting system, previously powered by solar cells outside. How can the villagers generate electricity? 

Splashdown recovery! Currently, NASA does not have any manned spacecraft in use (astronauts use the Russia Soyuz capsules). However, in the past, NASA capsules used a splashdown landing in the ocean. A helicopter would come to bring back the astronauts (and then the capsule) to an aircraft carrier dispatched for the purpose. The method has also been used by unmanned spacecraft, and will be used in the future. I therefore propose using Firewing as a recovery tool. It seems like he can fly long distances, so unlike the helicopters, range may not be an issue. Perhaps an aircraft carrier is completely unnecessary. This then greatly reduces the cost of splashdown recovery. Also, riding back in a capsule in a dragon's claws is pretty stylish, and reminiscent of Frodo and Sam being rescued by the Eagles from Mount Doom. . . 

Additionally, Photophysiology: Action of Light on Animals and Microorganisms; Photobiochemical Mechanisms; Bioluminescence cites the findings of Cormier and Eckroade (1962) of evidence of bioluminescent emission in the UV wavelengths in three species of the Renilla genus (commonly called sea pansies; these effects were later investigated by Hart et al. (1979)). It's important to note that the emission of photons in UV wavelengths is only due to a "tailing off" of the spectral energy distribution in the bioluminescence of these species. Feasibility is more complicated. The mechanism2 is $$\text{L}+\text{O}_2+\text{ATP}\to\text{oxy-L}+\text{CO}_2+\text{AMP}+\text{PP}+\text{light}$$ as mediated by the enzyme luciferase using one of the luciferin pigments. Essentially, the luciferin changes from an excited state to a ground state. Now, we can postulate the existence of a luciferin with an energy difference between these two states exactly right to produce one or more UV photons; in fact, Biology: The Unity and Diversity of Life claims that "some even emit ultraviolet or infrared light" but doesn't specify which luciferins it is referencing. 

I wrote some Mathematica code to look at the concentration of the plume as a function of distance. This code currently outputs a contour graph in the plane $y=0\text{ m}$. It is cut off at $x=25\text{ m}$, because otherwise the densities near the opening are too large and make it hard to see the rest of the contours. 

Given that $h\propto v^2$, this causes an increase in $h$ of about 20 (also, $M\sim70M_{\odot}$ for the LIGO binary) - and it lasts for only a very short amount of time before the source stops producing gravitational waves, post-coalescence. If we put these aliens near an area full of black hole binaries - never mind the absurdity involved in the formation of such a cluster, or the likely instabilities that could break it apart - we have the problem that different binaries could interfere with one another. Gravitational waves are . . . well, waves, and so are subject to constructive and destructive interference. A simple metric for the expansion and contraction of spacetime by a point source of gravitational waves coming along the $z$-axis is $$ds^2=dt^2-\left[(1+2H(t,z))dx^2+(1-2H(t,z))dy^2+dz^2\right]$$ where $$H(t,z)=h\cos\left[2\pi f(t-z/v)\right]$$ for frequency $f$ and speed $v$ (which should be $c$). This should make the actual wave nature of gravitational waves clearer. If we have two sources of gravitational waves aligned along the same axis, then they can either increase the strength of the signal or significant decrease it, depending on their respective strains and the values of their $t-z/v$. More complex interactions occur when different waves are at other odd angles to one another.
