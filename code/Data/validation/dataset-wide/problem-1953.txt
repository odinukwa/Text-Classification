10 years is much too large a gap to leave unexplained, especially if it's a recent gap. I agree with Christopher that your would-be employer is likely to assume the worst. Also, you held the job for 10 years, and you'd lose out on all the experience gained during that time. I would list the job and any relevant skills, but don't include the reason for leaving in the resume at all, for any job listed. However, be prepared for the inevitable question in the interview. When that happens, don't lie! (That could be grounds for dismissal even if they only find out about it after you're already hired.) Without knowing the specifics for your firing, you can probably present the information in a way that doesn't entirely damn you: For example, if you were ultimately fired because of a mistake you made, own up to it (but maybe play it down a little) and explain why it won't happen again. 

Challenge clauses that are important to you. Personal use of equipment is not important. Usually people check personal e-mail and facebook at work and it's technically a violation but is rarely enforced unless abused (which does happen too). It's not worth challenging trivial things like this. Contrast that with company ownership of all ideas you have while employed whether they are related to your job or occur to you while at work, which is a common clause in many tech contracts. Also think about restrictions on your ability to have a part time job, including part-time self employment or contracting work, which is also common in the tech industry. Finally look at non-compete clauses which can vary greatly by how narrow or broad they are. I've seen all of these and successfully challenged them and had annotations added to my contracts with specific allowances since I felt it was more important to have these freedoms than to have that particular job. In every case I did explain why it was important to me and have specific scenarios and examples that were technically in violation but caused the company no harm. 

If this is a clear deal-breaker for you, a 'Make or break the interview' as it were then you definitely need to bring it up in the interview. At the same time you don't want to phrase it in a way that makes it seem like you only want to show up '9-5' and go home as soon as the clock chimes. There are a few ways I think a problem like this can be tackled. Firstly, if you have the opportunity, you can ask some of your future colleagues how often they work out of hours. This means you are more likely to get an honest answer as some interviewers either fudge the answer or outright just don't know any more than what they are told. Secondly, you can just ask the interviewer in a way that shows the positive sides of your asking. For example: 

During an internship where you don't expect/intend to stay as a full employee afterwards, there's nothing wrong with interviewing elsewhere to secure a job after the internship ends. If the internship is comparatively short (about 3 months), starting that search even before the internship even starts makes a lot of sense. I agree that cancelling the internship would be akin to reneging on a job you already accepted. (However, if the internship is unpaid, an actual job offer might be a basis to renegotiate to see if it's possible to get at least some pay or shorten the internship.) 

Personally I throw all functional CV's and resumes into the trash. It's starting to be more of a trend, especially when people have a varied background without necessarily having anything to hide, but to me they don't provide what I'm looking for. When I look at a resume, I look for where they worked, when they worked there, and what they personally did at the job. I'll also look for where they went to school and hopefully their personal accomplishments at school if they're a relatively recent graduate. A functional style CV or resume makes it much harder to correlate accomplishments and skills with the jobs where those were met and used. Certainly some will disagree with me, but I quite literally trash them immediately. 

In general, it's best to clear this up as early as possible. An interview situation in which you are on first-name with the interviewer is probably relaxed enough for you to state your preferred name during the introduction, though I wouldn't correct them if they slip up. (I say "probably" because that depends a bit on how you read the interviewer.) In your case, this is slightly more complicated because all the people you talked to in the interview know you by your first name. How to proceed depends a bit on the circumstances. If you talk to different people, you get a new chance for a first introduction: use it. Otherwise correcting an earlier assumption might be awkward. On the other hand, a friendly explanation ("Actually, I prefer to go by Sara but I was so nervous last time I didn't say anything") might also leave a favourable impression. Again, it depends on your interviewers. Either way, when introducing yourself to the team as a group, it's probably best to mention your full name (first and middle name, because some of them know you by your first name) and stress your preference to be called "Sara". When introduced to people one at a time, you can go directly with "Sara" from the start. If you're introduced by someone else, ask them beforehand to introduce you as "Sara". Later on, a few friendly reminders are probably okay, but if your nickname doesn't stick, it's best to just accept that. 

Sure, you consult yourself out to him on your usual daily rates. The fact he is a friend just blurs the fact that this is still a business. Treat it like any other job, even draw up a contract based on time and cost and what your responsibilities will be. This means you can use the experience / credit like you would from any other job, stick it on your CV etc. This may also benefit your friend more than you can think of. For example perhaps this wake up call from you will help him realize what really goes into a project. What processes he really has to go through when requesting help from others, it will also help when they have to go through the process if they get a different contractor. It might be hard to do to your friend, but he isnt asking for your friendly advice, he is asking for your professional input, so thats how you have to do it, professionally. 

A few members of our current worker's council ("Betriebsrat") are leaving the company, so we'll need to find new candidates. I've discussed this topic with some of my colleagues and it seems like nobody really wants to do the part (including myself) but pretty much everyone agrees that someone should. Because of that I'm at least considering the idea of candidating. I know about the short-term benefits of being in the workers' council (increased job protection etc.), but I'm not going to be in this company forever and I'm worried about the long-term consequences. 

Disclaimer: I don't have prosopagnosia myself, but I do have difficulty remembering both names and faces (to a smaller degree). I feel that the best way to deal with this kind of problem is upfront, i.e. the first time you're introduced to a new person. "I have trouble recognizing faces, so please don't take it personally if I don't recognize you the next time we meet. If you want to talk to me, just say hi." Personally, I wouldn't use the more technical term unless someone asks about it. While people might have heard the term "face blindness", hardly anyone will recognize "prosopagnosia". Since you already have been working with your colleagues for a while, you might want to use a casual chatting situation (going to lunch together, hanging out by the coffee machine) to explain your problem. "By the way, I don't know if you noticed, but I'm unable to recognize faces. When I don't greet (any of) you I don't mean to be rude. I simply don't recognize you." Unfortunately, by now you probably have earned a reputation of being rude and standoffish, but if you explain your handicap often enough, chances are people will be understanding. Also, depending on how many people are in your office, you could just say hi (or nod or whatever) to everyone you meet as a friendly non-committal greeting, at least when you first arrive in the morning. After that, I don't think I ever greet my colleagues when I pass them in the corridor. 

You don't need to have proof, you're just reporting what you noticed. You can hedge your statements by saying this is just what you saw and you don't know what it means, but you felt you should report it. What your employer does with the information is up to them. Most gaming companies are very strict on employees interfering with games in any way. Usually people do this for personal gain, so it is a weird situation, but doesn't make it ok. 

Demonstrate outside work experience. The nice thing about programming is you can easily demonstrate skills that are not related to your employment. If you want to work in new technologies, go work in those technologies, write about them, contribute to some open source projects, create a github account and post some code of your own demonstrating what you can do. Put all this on your resume. It'll show that despite your employer using old technologies (like J2EE), you are interested in and can teach yourself new technologies. 

Be Visible In my experience some of the first people to go are the ones who don't seem to do anything, the ones that clock in at 9, clock out at 5 and stick to themselves all day. The ones who no-one knows what they do or why they do it, sometimes your perceived value has more of an affect than your actual value. So the easy solution is to be more visible, a big project is coming up? Volunteer to help out! This both gets you more visible and also provides tangible value to the company, both helping them avoid needing to do lay-offs and helping to make sure you don't go first! Avoid the blame game You aren't going to make any friends by getting into a problem and immediately yelling "Joe did it!". Focus instead on helping to fix the underlying issues that caused Joe to do such a thing. Patching up faults and being a team player are important in developing vital relationships that could one day pull you out of trouble. Be one step ahead Ok so maybe something new has just been released in your field, maybe something that could be of importance or use to your company. This is the perfect opportunity for you to learn it before its needed so you have vital skills that your company can utilize! This both increases your worth and provides more value to your company, reducing the need for lay-offs in the first place. Go above and beyond Find out whats important to your boss, or your bosses boss!, and go out of your way to meet their expectations. Don't overwork yourself, but if you really want to be seen as a valuable person who they couldn't survive without then make sure you are really giving it your all! Core Projects Work on core projects that are vital to your companies success! If you work on peripheral projects you too will be seen as peripheral, the best way to be seen as core to the company is to work on its core money makers! Conclusion Either way all these suggestions are designed to either increase your worth to the company or to at least increase your perceived worth to the company. Maintaining both is important in ensuring you aren't the first for the chopping block. Most suggestions even have the advantage of making it easier to get more work if you do get laid off, which is a nice side effect!
