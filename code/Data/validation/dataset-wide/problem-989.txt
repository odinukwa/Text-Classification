(a) What, if anything, is the difference between Earths geographic center, i.e. mid-point of the spin axis, and the gravitational center? (b) What is the average distance between the Earth's center of gravity, and the Earth-Moon system's center of gravity? (c) The recent 'super-moon' is a reminder that the moon's distance has an orbital wobble. So, by how much does this vary the distance between the Earth vs Earth-Moon gravitational centres, and (d) Is the moon's varying distance from the Earth sufficient to create any noticeable effect upon sea/ocean tidal amplitudes? 

Deep impact ejecta on the moon seem to indicate that the moon's mantle is predominantly 'low-calcium pyroxene' (recent letter to Nature), whereas the Earth's mantle (or at least the upper mantle) is dominantly olivine with only ~15% pyroxenes. So how can this discrepancy arise if the Earth and moon have a common origin? The only possibility I can think of is if partial fractionation of magnesium silicates actually took place in space, before falling to either Earth or moon, with the slightly denser olivine falling to the higher gravity of Earth, and less dense pyroxene falling to the lower gravity proto-moon. Is this possible? Is there any isotopic evidence of Earth-moon mantle commonality? 

Alas, you live in the wrong era. In the 1960s and 1970s by far the best and most informative was the geological museum in South Kensington (West London). Sadly, it is now dumbed-down - sacrificed on the alter of children's populism. The Colorado School of Mines geology museum is reckoned to one of the best, especially for minerals. Otherwise, I can't speak for America, but if you are ever in Vienna you must visit their Natural History Museum where the mineralogy and meteorite galleries are gob-smacking superb. The Natural History Museum in Adelaide, South Australia has the world's best exhibit of Eocambrian fauna, and also boasts a spectacular opalized plesiosaur. 

Anywhere on the planet where there is plate convergence probably has rising mountains, even in the ocean where there is back-arc volcanism, although the mountain building may be out of sight from the sea floor. So that includes all of the Andes, much of the European Alps, New Guinea and Indonesia. But there is not much happening in Africa or Australia. 

IF, and it's a very big IF, all the methane hydrate were to be released rapidly, then the planetary climate would be stuffed. But it won't happen. How much methane hydrate will be released due to global warming? Run 30 different atmospheric-ocean-coupled global climatic models, and you will get 30 different answers - all of them based upon arguable assumptions. The scaremongering doomsayers love to fanfare the worst case. In which case, some of your dire forebodings may come about. But first, take a balanced view of the physical reality. The vast majority of all the world's methane hydrate is sufficiently deep, on or in the sea floor, that it will be millennia, if ever, before they melt, thereby contributing to global warming. The deep ocean floor is everywhere only a few degrees above freezing, whereas almost all of the oceanic warming is in the uppermost few hundred metres. Check out the diagram in $URL$ and you will see that the pressure-temperature control is such that most of the methane hydrate will always be stable. The current consensus is that some methane is already being emitted from the thawing tundra, mainly in Siberia, Canada and Alaska, and some more will be released from shallow seas as and when they warm up. But this won't dominate the global warming process. In fact methane release is just one of at least two dozen feedback processes, some negative but mostly positive, which will influence the rate of global warming for the next few centuries. Making the world 'toxic', or 'like Venus' or the 'atmosphere turning brown', or 'poisoned birds dropping out of the sky' are all absurd, but that's no reason for complacency. The rise in global atmospheric methane amounts to about 6 parts per billion per year since 2006, or slightly more than 6 ppb in polar regions; significant, but not at all catastrophic. I am far more worried about the accumulating global CO2, which still shows no sign of slowing down despite a dirge of conference resolutions, ineffective carbon taxes, and empty political rhetoric. As for an 'extinction event', the extreme rapidity of global warming, habitat loss, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, all adds up to the fact that we are already in an extinction event - not for humans, most of whom will be able to engineer their way through a 3 to 4 degree C global temperature rise, but for the rest of the biosphere - with, or without, extra methane. Notwithstanding the scientific facts, maybe we can all relax, because Donald Trump assures us that climate change is just a fictitious Chinese conspiracy. 

The relative humidity is the ratio of the partial vapour pressure of air, to the equilibrium vapour pressure over pure water, at the same pressure - yes, it's slightly pressure dependent.But I would put an emphasis upon 'Equilibrium'. In both physics and chemistry one can get all kinds of bizarre results under non-equilibrium conditions, and >100% RH is one of them. It is just a transient feature caused by rapid changes in temperature, pressure, or absolute vapour pressure, and as such it is not really a genuine meteorological observation. Also, I advise caution when interpreting RH results. There is often a strong diurnal variation in RH, so if there is a met site taking only one reading a day, it could be unrepresentative of true average conditions. This is not so much a problem in advanced countries, where the measurements are (usually) reliably taken at set times. But it is often wildly misleading in developing countries where the observer may take a reading when/if he/she gets around to it, or maybe fakes the data altogether! 

Clearly you are referring to water locked up in hydrous minerals. The short answer is no, not much water in the Earth at all compared to the surface. The hotter it gets the more hydrous minerals tend to dehydrate, so there are only minuscule traces of water at great depth. I suggest you calculate a rough water balance of water carried into subduction zones = length of subduction zone x thickness x sediment porosity (under pressure) x average subduction rate. This should be compared with estimates of volcanic emission of water vapour (both to the atmosphere and submarine - more difficult to estimate). I'm guessing these should be more or less in equilibrium. The water volume involved is trivial compared to the water on the oceans. 

How much sample of volcanic rock is required to undertake a K-Ar date measurement, and does it matter if the rock contains vesicles? Are there tricks of the trade to get a good sample? 

Most of our geographic and astronomic terms were developed in pre-history in the northern hemisphere. Even early astronomers noticed that Polaris, the north star, was 'up' in the night sky, so north as 'up' simply became the convention. 

Weather stations and airports around the world almost always include an anemometer. Because of ground friction, the wind speed varies with height, so instrumental deployment is set at a standard height of 10 metres in open rural areas. This may require some adjustment in urban or forested areas. In fact, measuring accurate wind speeds above tree canopies is particularly difficult. There is quite an art in correctly positioning the instrumentation. Thousands of such anemometers and direction sensors are deployed on nearly every continent, and the results are part of the routine reporting. Such reporting may be every 24, 12, or 6 hours, or even shorter periods down to and including 'continuous'. Then comes the number crunching, in which the strength and direction is gridded and plotted on what appears to be a uniform distribution of points. In reality it is very far from a uniform distribution. With the introduction of increasing numbers of wind farms higher elevation wind measurements are becoming more important. 

No, we occasionally get fragments of upper mantle overthrust onto the Earth's crust, but then the specific gravity (density) contrast is not so great, roughly 2.7 to 3.0 for crust, about 3.2 for mantle. But the core is another matter. The density contrast is huge - the liquid outer core is between 9.9 and 12.2, whilst the solid core is estimated to be 12.6 to 13.0! (High pressure iron-nickel with some denser metals mixed in). Not only that, but the mantle is quite close to the surface, only tens of kilometres deep, whereas the Earth's core is 3000 kilometres below the surface. Sadly, there is no volcanic process that comes from even remotely that depth. Alas - many geologists, myself included, would dearly love to sample the core and compare the composition to iron meteorites (assumed similar). There are many other questions of geochemistry and isotopic composition which might be answered if only we could sample that deep. Unfortunately it is way beyond even the most optimistic advances in technology, so we just have to theorize. 

There are about 3 tonnes of uranium in every cubic kilometre of seawater, but in the general circulation there is no mechanism to concentrate the uranium, except perhaps low-level adsorption on manganese nodules in some parts of the sea bed. To concentrate the uranium you need some mechanism to transport it, and some other mechanism to make it precipitate. Both are pH-redox controlled, requiring substantial reducing conditions. The nearest plausible mechanism I can think of is a high concentration of uranium in groundwater, such as in the Aktau province of Kazakhstan, adjacent to the Caspian Sea. At present the Caspian is too oxygenated, and is likely to remain that way because of inflow from the Volga, but if climate change alters the rainfall-runoff relationship then that inflow to the Caspian would be reduced. Conceivably, it wouldn't take too much more pollution and reduced river inflow to make the deeper parts of the northern Caspian more reducing. Then maybe you could get uranium deposition at the groundwater-lakewater interface. 

Farrenthorpe is right, a little surfing the net for snow distribution would clarify the picture for you. However, I think you are referring to certain times when it rains further north and snows further south. There are several reasons for local anomalies, of which the most important is the dynamics of the polar jet streams. These are strong high-altitude wind that blow constantly in both hemispheres. These winds have meanders which migrate around the world, as depicted in: 

The cause is partly geometry and partly process. Subduction zones generally take oceanic crust and upper mantle down into the deeper mantle, but the angle of the subduction zone varies greatly. For example, the Tonga Trench is very steep, giving rise to a 'tight' earthquake zone. At its shallowest, the two plate boundary isn't even a subduction zone at all, but becomes obduction, overthrusting oceanic crust/mantle over the plate, as happened with the Oman ophiolite. Then there are ocean-continent collisions, such as western South Americas. Because the continental crust is much less dense than oceanic crust, it is more buoyant, so you get a broader subduction zone than you would with a back arc overlying ocean-ocean collision. Finally, there are continent-continent collisions, typified by India-Tibet, where none of the crust can sink very deep, so you get a stack of imbricate over-thrusts, as in most of Tibet and the Himalayas, all linked to earthquakes over hundreds of kilometres width, as in the Nepalese quake of last year. Also consider the tectonics involved. Where two tectonic plates slide against each other there may be little or no subduction, but stress release in the transcurrent fault can still create major earthquakes - think the San Andreas Fault, or New Zealand. Kim points out the thickness of earthquake zones such as those north of Australia. It isn't just in southeast Asia. We can see similar complexities in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Caribbean and elsewhere, where there are many micro-plates jostling in a complex pattern. They only seem like one seismic zone because of the scale of your diagram. There is yet a different story in the Rift Valley of Africa. The above are just some sketchy simplifications of a revolution in geological understanding that started in the late 1960s, and which are still continuing. It's not possible to give a detailed explanation in this forum, but there are many excellent and fascinating textbooks. Warning - you can get hooked. Then it becomes a lifetime study. 

In general, the Earth's atmospheric heat distribution is to shunt heat polewards, and it is universally recognized that the lion's share of the temperature rise from climate change will occur in polar areas (for several reasons). As to some places becoming unlivable, yes indeed, parts of the tropics and some places further north, are already heading towards that state. One thinks of North India where heat waves are now reaching the mid to high 40s (centigrade), which is the sort of temperature where people who can't afford air conditioning drop dead from heat exhaustion. This is likely to get worse. Also, be aware that there are many +/- anomalies, including oceanic islands (high humidity) and coastal sub-Saharan Africa, where an increase of about 1.5 deg C above historic means are already making life difficult for some. In the Arctic dramatic changes in lifestyle are also occurring, and will continue to do so at an accelerating rate. The 2 deg C limiting temperature rise, beloved of politicians (and which is already looking unattainable), is just a global average, within which the Arctic temperature rise could easily exceed 10 deg C.
