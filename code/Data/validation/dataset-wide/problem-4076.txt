The exercise in Algebras, Lattices, Varieties Volume I by McKenzie, McNulty, and Taylor may be of interest: There is a term t(x,y,z) in three variables in the language of one binary symbol which is universal in the sense, that, given an infinite set A and a ternary operation G(x,y,z) on the set A, there is a binary operation on A such that, when t is constructed out of this binary operation, then G(x,y,z) = t(x,y,z) for all triples x,y,z from A. Note that the term t specified is independent of A or G. I do not know if universality is defined for tuples of terms (I would be expect that serious side conditions need to be present in order for a tuple of terms to represent uniformly a tuple of operations of the same arity, thus making it not so universal). For the question regarding whether a given countable family of operations can be built from one operation, this is a consequence of asking if the clone generated by the family of operations is generated by one operation. Given that there are uncountable many clones on a 3-element set, I would say that the question is of interest but unlikely to be solvable uniformly or even nicely. By this I mean, if Q(F) is some way of expressing that the family F generated a clone which is finitely generated, I can imagine necessary condtions implied by Q(F) and sufficient conditions which could imply Q(F), but nothing which would be equivalent. (The question of whether F is contained in a finitely generated clone might be easier, but I do not know how much easier.) You probably have better access to references on clone theory than I; you might try pursuing those first before asking me for a further opinion.

To your direct question, I don't know any answer that would improve upon a standard web search, or be better than one that could be gleaned from lurking on an academia type forum. So I will change the question, and answer that. Question: How can one design an alternative format for conducting a graduate class, presumably with the goal of improving the result, namely that the students get closer to mastery of their craft? (Of course, multiple goals could be considered, for example the convenience and satisfaction of the director of the class. However, to make things fun, I assume the director has unlimited resources.) One answer to this question is to consider the techniques or characteristics of the goal, and tailor the course to offer repeated practice of exercises which should encourage mastery of those techniques or acquistion of those characteristics. To demonstrate, let me take good communication as a theme. One can focus on various techniques which lead to asking a good question or giving a good presentation, but the student does not learn them without doing them, and in my worldview based on my experiences, doing them several times is required. George Bergman had a technique which he used for both graduate and undergraduate level classes, to which I suggested a modification that he adopted. Before the class, each student was supposed to have read the material for that class, and come up with a question about some aspect of the material that they didn't understand. They wrote that question on a slip of paper (and if they understood everything, they would tag it "Pro forma" to indicate they did not need the answer), and then turned that in at the beginning of class. George would then spend some portion of the class answering those questions. I don't know if he did this, but he could have tracked a lot from these questions alone, and used it to help students ask good questions. I could provide examples regarding other aspects of communication and ways of addressing them in a graduate mathematics class, but I instead invite you to consider designing your own format to test your ideas about effective education, and then bring those ideas and that design to a forum for critical review.

As stated, there are a couple of counterexamples F. There are no known counterexamples when X is in F and X is finite and nonempty. I do not know of Peter Frankl's original motivation. A 1990 paper of Bjorn Poonen "On the Union-Closed Sets Conjecture" has some suggestive examples, however. Note that it holds when F is the powerset of a nonempty X, and also when F is "large enough" in the sense that the average set size of a set in F is at least half the size of X. Also (as Dustin Mixon remarks), it is a very accessible and nontrivial statement, but not like Gauss said of Fermat's Last Theorem as being one of hundreds of statements in number theory of which he could neither readily prove nor dispose.

I think that you need a second (and perhaps third) opinion from a professional. If possible, write some individual emails requesting people to give a quick impression as to the publication-worthiness of your result. Since the result is on ArXiv, no question of precedence should arise. You can ask the author you asked before for names of other people to ask. It is important that you emphasize that you don't need them to spend time going over the paper (if all you need is a quick impression; for a more thorough review, you will want a different strategy of approach). Please note: MathOverflow is a place for specific questions. If you have trouble with a particular proof, you can ask about that detail. Zev Chonoles is right in commenting that MathOverflow is not a place to solicit reviewers for your work. Pablo Shmerkin is (somewhat) right in the idea that it is smart to include a link to your ArXiv submission, in case someone is interested and volunteers to review it. (In short: Asking for review on MathOverflow, bad; making it possible using less than 100 characters without asking, not so bad, and possibly priceless.)

This is weakly related to an answer to your second question. Also it is fragmentary, and possibly some details are misremembered. It relates to some of the first original mathematics I did over 20 years ago. There is a result of Vadim Murskii, which goes by the tagline "Almost All Finite Algebras Are Finitely Based". Fix a similarity type which includes at least one function of arity two. (There may be a way to handle structures which have only unary functions, but I don't recall it.) Consider all structures of that type on a (labeled) set of n elements. Since it has a binary operation, there are at least n^(n^2) such structures, and likely many more. If one looks at a structure A, one can note a property that the structure has. A is finitely based if the equational theory of the variety generated by A is equivalent to a theory which is generated by finitely many axioms in equational logic. We say almost all algebras are finitely based if, as n gets large, the proportion of finitely based labeled algebras on n elements compared to all such algebras on n elements goes to 1. There are a couple of ways to prove such a result, and I studied them and gave a talk on them as a graduate student. I went from notes of R. Quackenbush, as well as attempting to read Murskii's papers from the 1960's and 1970's. One key idea was to reduce the problem to looking at magmas, and another was to look at certain classes of magmas which were able to be algebraically classified and shown to be provably finitely based. Looking at idempotent magmas was one of the interesting features of the analysis. Indeed, part of the argument was to show that if a magma had one of eight or ten special properties, then something nice occurred, generally you could show it was part of a negligible fraction of such algebras, or it was related to a finitely based magma, or something else that occurred. To tie this back to your question, one of the properties talked about a deficient magma, which is a special form of your property. If A is a magma on n > 3 elements, it is deficient if there is a subset B of at least 3 and fewer than n elements, such that the cardinality of B is at least the cardinality of B*B, where I am using * for the magma operation. This is more general than having a not too small subalgebra. Also, being deficient turns out to be relatively rare. (I wondered why B having 2 elements was excluded. I discovered those magmas are not rare, and I also discovered a simpler proof that almost all magmas were not deficient.) If you were to find the notes of Quackenbush, or use a citation index starting with Murskii, or do a web search of "almost all" finite algebras, you might find some papers like Ralph Freese's on probability in algebra, or work of Sapir and McNulty on the finite basis problem. Hopefully though, you will find something that fully addresses your question 2. Gerhard "Ask Me About 2-Deficient Groupoids" Paseman, 2013.06.11
