Leave it, and admire the battle scars. Hide it with decals or accessories or tape. Gently spot-sand and then use some nail polish or similar to hide the damage. Generally takes two applications, sometimes more, to build the depth of colour and hide the silver. You want a colour as similar to your paint as possible. Don't bother touching up stickers Full strip and respray - this is significant amounts of work and expense. 

Remember there's absolutely nothing wrong with 9 speed rear. The chain is a little thicker and therefore more long-lasting than 10 or 11 speed. If you got parts for free from a dead donor bike, it would be worth doing, but otherwise it gets quite expensive for minimal gain. 

Did you take one of the crank arms off at some point? Did one fall off accidentally? Or is someone playing a trick on you? Remove dust cap if its in the crank's axle. Unscrew the nut of the left side crank, probably a 14mm socket. Take the pedal crank off - it should be really hard and you need a crank puller, or it will be suspiciously easy. Put crank arm back on so its the right position compared to the other side. Reinstall nut/bolt and tighten it up good and tight. Reinstall dust cap if you had one. I've been guilty of doing it wrong... mostly because of working later at night when tired. 

Short answer: No. There are no caliper mounts on the rear triangle of the frame so you can't mount brake calipers there. There are solutions that add mount points, but they're pretty bad idea and have never taken off. Plus an adapter would probably cost more than a used bike with disks. Most braking is done on the front wheel, so fitting a disk brake there will get you 90% of the improvements anyway. You need a disk brake rotor, disk-compatible hub, a caliper, possibly a mounting adapter, a cable or hose, and a new brake lever. Buying all that new could cost as much as a good lightly-used bike. Your front wheel could have a disk brake - the fork has mount points on it for disk brakes. However your wheel is not disk brake compatible so you need a new hub, which probably means a replacement wheel. If you can salvage parts off another bike, then that's the only way to make it cost-effective. 

2.5 Ah battery USB connectors are friction fit, which is fine at home on a desk but is not overly secure in the bumpy outside world. So I use quite short USB cables to do the connection, and lay the phone on top of the battery inside a top-tube holder like this: 

Between your downtube and seattube holders you will have 1.5-1.6 Litres of liquid, and more if you use bigger bottles. If ~3 litres is not enough, go for a bigger hydration pack. Other options are 

At first I thought this was trolling. But having made a sticky mess of my brake levers last weekend, there's a hidden relevant question. Option 1 Don't eat on the bike. Rides under an hour don't really need fueling while riding. Option 2 Stop to eat. Its not hard to put a foot down and eat your food standing still. Could even dismount at a park bench, or stop at a convenient coffee shop. Option 3 Gels - they're expensive and quite variable, but 30 or 60 millilitre gels can provide a boost. The trick is to get ones that work for you. Some require a good swig of water with them else they irritate the stomach. Some gels are the consistency of caramel sauce, and need to be forced out the foil bag, and some are more sloppy and can ooze easily. With the wet ones, its easiest to tear the top and hold the open end between your teeth, and then squeeze the pouch with one hand as opportunity allows. Holding the foil pouch in your hand is asking for a mess. Remember, don't be that-guy... take all your rubbish with you, don't litter. Option 4 Bananas are good bike fruit, and muesli bars work for some people too. I find bananas too squashy, and muesli bars too dry so they mess with breathing. 

Keeping it general - if you're interested and keen on cycling for health or fitness, or you have a competitive streak, then joining a club is a good idea at any age, and at any skill level. We can't speak for specifics of the clubs in your local region. Most clubs quieten down in the winter/off months, more so at Northerly and Southerly latitudes. Or they might shift focus to indoor riding if there is access to a velodrome facility. The main benefits are 

Depends how broken down / disassembled it is. Normally a new bike is shipped in a box with the front wheel removed or sometimes both wheels removed. 

I am swapping around some hubs, and this means rebuilding two wheels, a 20" and a 26", both 36 spoke and both were done standard cross-3 lacing. Here's how the 26" wheel hub looks after assembly. 

Looks like a generic beach cruiser - not very old either. The brazed lugs on the downtube suggest it was a geared bike, converted to single speed. The V brakes say its no older than the 90s, and probably post-2000. Its doesn't appear to be anything specifically Italian. Still if it rides nicely, then ride it. There's likely no museum or vintage nature there. 

I used a "hook" tool to unscrew the lockring - it was a standard righthand thread. The dust cover responded to a screwdriver so I gently levered it out without bending it. So my question is - do I continue using chain whips to try and unscrew each sprocket, or do I try and snag something into those two slots in the side of the bearing cup, or are those 9 tiny little slots where some special tool should engage? 

I did a MTB relay last year, and got 30 minutes riding followed by 2 hours of downtime. You need to warm up for 10 to 15 minutes before your turn. Some time on a training bike is good, even doing short 400m circuit laps off the official track, or on a spare bike on rollers. Jogging and stretching is a poor second to a bike warmup, but its better than sitting in a deck chair with a hot cuppa. HOWEVER don't be caught still on the trainer/rollers when your teammate arrives - have a spotter out and use radios or something to warn the next rider. Be on the bike ready to go as soon as the transponder gets to you. Use off-cycle teammates, one to grab and support the incoming rider, and another on teh other side to move the ankle transponder to the fresh rider. Then go-go-go! Get a seat push-off from the person moving the transponder to get up to speed. Or relax and enjoy the social side - don't let the racing bit spoil a nice team event..... says no rider ever! 

Yes, two phrases for the same thing. More specifically its the frame's serial number. Other components may have their own serial numbers too. Any electric shifting component will likely have serial numbers which can be read by software, as will power meters or other sensors. Small priced items generally don't have serial numbers. 

Have you considered an intermediate jackshaft with a two-stage gear? Easiest thing would be to salvage a bottom bracket and a triple chainring, and weld it somewhere between the normal pedals and the rear wheel. This would give you: 

I've got a friend who had a cellphone stolen. She used the provider's tools to locate the phone down to a suburban address, and went to get it back. The teenager who answered the door knock said there was no such phone there. Her brother called it and they heard it ringing in the background. Some more people turned out of the house and denied her entry. She phoned the police with this info and they weren't interested, plus advised her that entering the house to recover the phone would be illegal and that she should write a written official complaint at the police station. She went to the police station to do a report. Her phone was turned off/wiped before she could demonstrate the location to the officer taking the report. The phone was never recovered. Answer GPS tracking by itself isn't going to save your ride. You need a multilayered approach of locks, safer location, uglifying, and co-parking with nicer bikes. Or park it inside with you. I am fortunate to work for a company where 25% of the staff ride. So we have dedicated floor space for secure bike parking inside. At home my bike lives in a locked garage. So I don't ride with a lock normally. If I have to stop elsewhere I'll generally ride the beater MTB and a lock, rather than the nicer road bike. Sorry its not a bike, but its relevant to GPS tracking and recovery of stolen items. Edit: Clarifying - location information by itself is pretty useless. You need to be able to get support from the police to make use of the location info to get your stuff back. Simply rocking up to the door could go either way. 

If you don't realign the dropouts, the wheel will wander easily, even hard pedal presses can pull the wheel out of alignment. 

Bike tyre sizing is a horrible mess. Your wheel is a 700c - that means the diameter of the whole wheel. you have to get a tube that is a 700. The second number on the tube relates to the width of the tyre, and is often given as a range. Racing tyres are 18-23 mm, the next band is often 25-35, So you need to read the writing on the sidewall of your tyre and see if its a 700-28c or similar. It doesn't matter what width of tyre the bike came with, what matters is the width of tyre on the bike now. Refer to How are tire sizes measured? for more info. 

Vertical adjustment of a wheel is exactly the same as adjusting for wobble, except you loosen the nipples going to both sides of the hub rather than tightening one side and relaxing the other side. Wheel truing is an art that can be explained but not learned without doing. Most wheel truing stands have a way to measure "out of round" as well as left/right wiggle. Depending on what happened to the rim, it may be stretched or dented in that spot, or it may require ridiculously spoke tensions to pull it back to "round" You have to make the judgement call about how bad it is and whether replacement is required. 

Old steel bikes are not worth recycling, in terms of economics. The price on Steel varies, but its ranges from $10 to $155/tonne based on what sort it is. And while an old bike could have up to 20 kg of steel, its fiddly to strip off all the non-steel, and the income doesn't pay for the time. That's 1c to 15c per kilogram, or 20c-$3 for a bike with 20 kilos of steel By comparison, aluminium / aluminum is $1.33/kg for extrusion, and $1.18/kg for cast. Carbon fibre cannot be recycled like metals, so is outside the scope of this answer. Do note that you have to strip a bike down to less than component parts. And most recyclers will not pay anything for oily parts, so you need to clean all the oil off too. From a cost perspective, recycling parts that are reusable is poor economics. Recycling only makes sense if the part is unserviceable through damage or wear, as a better answer than throwing them in the rubbish. tl;dr reuse! 

Impact Did your front wheel get bent? The one in the photos looks fine, so if that's the one then your fork was weak and took all the force. I'd have expected the tube to flat and the wheel rim to go out of round and maybe break some spokes. Weakness The last photos show its bent just above the bearing race, right on the edge of what gets hot during welding. My guess is that there was an inherent weakness above the fork crown welds, and this frontal impact has expose the weak metal. If you attempt to bend it back, you will further weaken the metal either invisibly, or tear the metal in a way you can see. Todo Your best safest plan is to replace the forks and frame, and keep all the useful parts (like that strong front wheel!) I'd expect that over time there will be rust developing in a ring around the top and down tubes, about 50mm aft of the head tube. This is another sign of frontal impact. Just to be clear: 

Data points for your comparison: I switched from a 26" MTB with 3x7 speed to a 700 road bike, also with 3x7. $URL$ tells me that my ride speeds have increased by about 5 km/h on pretty much every segment. My climbing times have dropped by 10%-20% but it wasn't any easier. The aluminium road bike is 11 KG vs the 17 KG of the steel MTB. 

Instead, Your friend has managed to merge the concept of tyre sealant products like Stans or Slime, with canned silicon. 

Upgrade for Safety Personally? I'd scrap the steel wheel, and replace the whole rim with a modern alloy rim. This will make braking work much better too. Downside, is that modern 700c wheels are a few millimetres smaller than your existing 27" wheels. So the brakes have to reach a bit further, and you need new tyres. Your spare tubes should be okay though. 

Depends - you will probably need to remove the cassette/freewheel anyway, to get enough room to get the spoke in even though its the non-drive side. I've replaced one by bending the spoke horribly to get it through the hub, and while it worked was not a good technique. You will need a spoke key for tensioning - an adjustable spanner may work but its asking for rounded-off nipples. Or you can remove the tube and tyre and maybe tension it with a flat screwdriver. If you don't feel confident, its safest to get a bike shop to do it. They will only need the wheel, not the whole bike. You'll need to buy a new spoke of the right length too, the LBS can measure your old one. 

You're not peloton-svelte, so I'd recommend a 36 spoke rear wheel/rim that otherwise duplicates all the measurements of the stock rim. More spokes is a stronger-better wheel. 40 and 48 spoke is also possible, but they're a bit more rare. A $500 USD bike is better than a BSO, but it will still have average wheels at best. An upgrade to the rear wheel is a good idea, if you like the bike and it fits you well. Shop around, you might find a pair for fair price, being not a lot more than a single. The other option is to buy a rim/spokes/hub separately and have a good LBS build it for you. 

Yes a comfort or beach cruiser bike is harder to ride at the same speed as a hybrid/commuter bike. The hybrid bike will have larger rims (29"/700c) but narrower tyres (25-35mm) where the comfort bike could be anything from 20" to 26" and with a tyre width of 30-50mm. The comfort bike will have roughly zero body weight on the hands - almost all the rider's weight will be on the saddle and a very small amount on the forward pedal. The hybrid will have more weight on the hands, allowing more pedal pressure and therefore more power. So the hybrid will be faster than the comfort bike for the same effort. 

Your suggestion of radial might have been related to a "half radial" lacing pattern like this one: However notice that there are still the same number of spokes to holes. The 18 spokes on the left side will be shorter so you have to buy 18 shorter spokes. It looks like this fully done: 

I'm trying to swap out the top jockey wheel on a rear shifter mechanism. The bottom jockey wheel simply unbolted as expected but the top one seems to share a shaft with the main spring rather than having its own bolt. I can twist one of the cage plates a complete turn but it doesn't unthread anything. I can see a steel nubbin through a small slot, but its not shaped like a bolt head. Is this Unserviceable?
