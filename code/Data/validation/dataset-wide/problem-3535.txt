I'm searching for bibliography on the critiques to the Mankiw, Romer, Weil (1992) paper. If possible, could you give references to each critique? Any help would be appreciated. 

Imagine we have a linear regression model with dependent variable $y$. We find its $R^2_y$. Now, we do another regression, but this time on $\log(y)$, and similarly find its $R^2_{\log(y)}$. Why can't I compare both $R^2$ to see which model is better suited? Intuitively I would say that the log will decrease the variability, hence any model will improve once we 'add' the log transformation. Is there another reason? Also is there a way to formalise this intuition? Any help would be appreciated. 

I'm trying to find some data on the level of corruption in Venezuela, since Chavez came to power, and its evolution along time. I've searched the world bank, but they don't seem to have this data on Venezuela... 

I don't understand how the participation rate influences the growth of GDP per capita. Is it because in the per capita, besides the labour force, we also take into consideration the rest of the population? And what's the link between productivity and labour force? Any help would be appreciated. 

Maybe it's just my english... In reading some notes on the estimations of parameters for stationary models like AR, MA, and ARMA, the author states that when we apply OLS to a simple AR(1) $\{Y_t\}$ with mean $\mu$, «we sometimes say, except for end effects, $\hat \mu = \bar Y$, where $\bar Y$ is the sample average. What does the expression «end effects» mean? Any help would be appreciated. 

I'm looking for some bibliography for International Macroeconomics/Finance. Any suggestions? Any help would be appreciated. 

In Blanchard's Macroeconomics, page 211, 5th edition, the author using the following three mathematical equalities 

I would like to know how to find a Euro zone country real quarterly gdp growth, using the OECD database. We have Quarterly GDP, and CPI. How should I proceed? If it's not possible, which database can I use to obtain it? Any help would be appreciated. 

In Herbst and Schorfheide "Bayesian Estimation of DSGE Models", in the appendix named "Data Sources", they show several formulas relating the empirical data which should be used for the model. Here's a snapshot from the book. 

The notes I'm reading define the IRF as $\text{IRF}(h)=E_t(X_{t+h})-E_{t-1}(X_{t+h}|\text{shock}_t)$. All the examples they show are linear, i.e. ARMA. However, they say that for nonlinear the formula gets harder. But they don't show explicitly how to do it. So,how does one compute the IRF for non-linear models? Any help would be appreciated. 

In a book I'm reading on macroeconomics, it's stated that since in the short run the output (and dividends) increase, and the nominal interest rate decreases, the stock prices will go up, because the monetary expansion was unexpected. My question is: shouldn't the rational investor know that changes in the nominal interest rate are only short term, with the longer term effect being in the opposite direction, and hence it's not clear cut that stocks' price should go up? Or should they always go up? Is it due to expected inflation that counteracts the higher expected nominal interest rate? 

In macro we learn that credibility is very important for a Central Bank (CB), since it allows for less onerous adjustments for the economy. In the recent(?) past, the newspapers have becoming increasingly concerned with ECB missing its target inflation of 2%. However, not every cause for a smaller inflation is a bad one, at current moment. The oil prices have been very low, and this shock to the price-setting curve is not bad, instead it can be seen as an increase in the productivity, increasing the level of the equilibrium output. This may decrease inflation, but does it necessarily bring about the problems of deflation? Also, when reading this article on the impact of the QE of the ECB, it seems that they use not Inflation, but Core inflation and Core inflation-adjuted to energy prices to 'filter' the true impact of QE on the price level of the economy. Should we not also look at core inflation and its adjustment for energy prices when assessing the ECB policy efficacy? Any help would be appreciated. 

In page 311 of Gujarati Basic Econometrics, there's the following example for use of dummy variables, when we're interested in the interaction between two qualitative terms. 

I'm reading some note of Eric Sims on extensions to RBCs and he writes «In any balanced growth path, feasibility requires that hours do not grow». The author then explains that this is so, because if it decreased than working hours would eventually decrease to zero, and if they were increasing, then they would reach the max which is 1. Honestly, I don't get what he means by feasibility here. Is it a mathematical term, or should I read it as plain english? Any help would be appreciated 

How can someone measure the expected annual price growth rate for oil? Also, where can I find past annual price growth rate for oil values? Any help would be appreciated. 

Shouldn't real wages have a similar trend to productivity? Why was there that discrepancy since the 2009 until 2014? Maybe some other factor that shifted the PS, or the WS curve? It's interesting to notice that in Jun 1st 2014 began the sharp fall in oil prices, which may be the cause for the increase in the real wage we've been observing until know. It seems that workers productivity has had little impact in the behaviour of real wages... Any help would be appreciated. Edit: I'm including a graph with CPI in GBR with data from OECD. 

In this link, we can read "The revised reading of second-quarter gross domestic product growth beat analysts’ expectations triggering a stock-market rally and a bond selloff." Well, why can we assume that the upward pressure on the nominal interest rate won't be enough to decrease the stock values by counteracting the increasing nominal dividends that stocks provide?(i.e. the LM curve is flat) 

Result (3.44) is $Var(\hat u_t^2)=E(\hat u_t^2)=(1-h_t)\sigma^2$, and it's also the result they refer to as 'in the previous exercise', and (3.46) is just the first equation, without the plims. So, what LLN can I apply? Any help would be appreciated. 

I'm reading this book on macroeconomics. When determining the nominal interest rate, the Central Bank has in mind its real interest rate goal. By the Fisher Equation: $i_t=r_t+\pi^{E_{CB}}_{t+1}$, since at time $t$, I would need to know the price level at time $t+1$ to know inflation for next period, we use an expected value for inflation. I put the superscript $^{E_{CB}}$ to denote that the expectancy is formed by the central bank. In the usual Philips Curve, we have $\pi_{t+1}=\pi^{E_{SS}}_{t+1}+\alpha(y_{t+1}-y_e)$ I put the superscript $^{E_{SS}}$ to denote that the expectancy is formed by the Supply Side (wage and price setters, i.e., with all available public information). Recently, from a talk with someone who worked at a central bank, I learned that there's some difference in amount/quality of information that it's publicly available to wage and price setters, and that which is available to the Central Bank. In the book I'm reading, the authors state one possible way of escaping a deflation trap, even if in practice it will not always work, is that to have higher expectations so that the minimum threshold for the real interest rate is lower enough to increase output until equilibrium. Now I was wondering if it was not possible for, in some situation, the CB publicly divulged information lead to workers and firms have higher expected inflation, while the CB would know those expectations to be a bit too optimistic, such that in reality that period real interest rate would be much lower to be enough to get out of deflation trap? I think I must be making some errors in this reasoning. Any help would be appreciated
