Your question is essentially about surjective stability for relative symplectic $K_1$. The latter follows from the usual (absolute) surjective stability for $K_1$, which in symplectic case starts at $2n\geq \mathop{\mathrm{sr}}(R)$. To prove this, one can use so-called "Stein relativization", as described in M. Stein, "Relativizing Functors on Rings and Algebraic K-Theory", J.Algebra, 1971. See Corollary 1.7 therein or the remark after Theorem 4.2 in Stein's other paper, "Stability theorems for $K_1$, $K_2$ and related functors modelled on Chevalley groups", Japan J. Math, 1978. It is also possible to prove it directly under somewhat weaker assumprion on a ring by explicit calculations with generators, but since you are interested in Dedekind domains, the usual stable rank condition should suffice. 

Corollary 7.10 extends this result to rings of the form $A[x_1^\pm,\ldots,x_k^\pm,x_{k+1},\ldots,x_n]$ for $A$ regular. For other Chevalley groups the situation is complicated. One has the stability theorems for $K_1(\Phi)$ in terms of stable rank (or its ramifications such as absolute stable rank or $\Lambda$-stable rank), but they give pretty bad bounds for polynomial rings. There is, however, the following version of Suslin's theorem for symplectic group in a paper "On symplectic groups over polynomial rings" by F. Grunewald, J. Mennicke and L. Vaserstein: 

By locally principal ring they mean a commutative ring such that its localization at any maximal ideal is a principal ideal ring. For euclidean ring $A$ this gives $K_1(\mathsf{C}_\ell,R)=0$. As a byproduct they also prove a stronger version of Suslin's theorem for $SL$ and a locally principal ring. They also have a version for Laurent polynomial rings and claim that by using stability theorems for $K_1$ as in M. Stein's papers one can prove the same results for classical simple algebraic groups of relative rank $\geqslant2$, but the latter has never been written in full details. 

Here "nice" means that there is an explicit description of the action of the standard generators of $\mathfrak{g}$, so one could actually write (infinite) matrices for the Lie algebra elements. I have checked some sources including Lie Algebras of Finite and Affine Type by R. Carter and Affine Lie Algebras, Weight Multiplicities and Branching Rules by Kass, Moody, Patera and Slansky, but none contains such details even for the smallest cases like $\tilde{A}_1$. Here is a picture from the second: 

Consider the root system $\mathsf{B}_n$ with the standard numbering of the fundamental roots (that is, $\alpha_n$ is short). Take $\alpha_{n-2}$ and $\alpha_n$ as a pair of orthogonal roots (indeed, $\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_n$ is not a root), and take $\gamma=\alpha_{n-1}+\alpha_n$. Then $\beta_1=\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_{n-1}+\alpha_n$, $\beta_2=\alpha_{n-1}+2\alpha_n$ and $\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_{n-1}+2\alpha_n$ are all roots. But among the differences of the form $\beta_i-\alpha_j$ the only roots are $\beta_1-\alpha_{n-2}$, $\beta_1-\alpha_n$ and $\beta_2-\alpha_n$, so this gives a counter-example. The beautiful pictures of Hasse diagrams you refer to provide a good way to spot such examples, but for this one should draw them in a different way, which is easier to read. The keyword here is a weight diagram. For examples, see this collection of the diagrams along with a description of their various usages. Namely, Figure 14 on page 35 is the weight diagram of the adjoint representation of a group (or of a Lie algebra) of type $\mathsf{B}_n$, which also describes the structure of the root system (its vertices are the roots, plus the "zero weights" corresponding to the fundamental roots). One looks for a square which has non-consecutive label on its sides (say $i$ and $j$), such that the bonds joining its top or bottom vertex to something on the right are also labeled by either $i$ or $j$. Such a square is immediately found on the very bottom of the picture slightly to the left from the middle. By the way, the quick inspection of the weight diagrams shows that there is no counter-examples besides the one above (I'm not sure, but I haven't spotted any). 

If you haven't already, you might find it worthwhile to read the paper by Drinfeld: Drinfeld, V.G.: Quantum Groups, Proceedings of ICM (Berkeley 1986) Providence RI American Math. Soc. 1987, 198–820. I think it is appropriate to a general audience, although not all statements are explained completely. 

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. The polynomial current Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}[t] = \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathbb{C} [t]$ has the bracket $$[xt^r, yt^s] = [x,y] t^{r+s}$$ for $x,y \in \mathfrak{g}$. It is graded with deg$(t) = 1$. If we set $h=0$ in Drinfeld's first presentation of the Yangian (given in Theorem 12.1.1 of Chari and Pressley's Guide to Quantum Groups) then we get a presentation of $U(\mathfrak{g}[t])$ where the generators are the elements $x \in \mathfrak{g}$ and $J(x) = xt$ of $\mathfrak{g}[t]$ with degree $=0,1$, and the relations all have degree of both sides less than $3$. 

Specifically we require that all the relation in $\mathfrak{g}$ are satisfied for the elements with degree 0, and (for all $x,y, x_i, y_i, z_i \in \mathfrak{g}$ and complex numbers $\lambda, \mu$): $$\lambda xt + \mu yt = (\lambda x + \mu y)t$$ $$[x, yt] = [x,y]t,$$ $$\sum_i [x_i, y_i] = 0 \implies \sum_i [x_i t, y_i t ] = 0$$ $$ \sum_i [[x_i, y_i], z_i] = 0 \implies \sum_i [[x_i t, y_i t], z_i t]=0$$ Then assuming that all the relations of degree less than or equal to $3$ hold is enough to get the remaining ones. The elements $xt^2, xt^3, \ldots$ are defined inductively. This can be proved by induction, using the Serre presentation of the finite-dimensional Lie algebra and then checking all the required relations in several cases. But even in the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ case the argument is laborious. 

I will suggest the article Quantization of Lie bialgebras, III by Pavel Etingof and David Kazhdan. It discusses both the Yangian and the dual Yangian as examples in the context of quantization of Lie bialgebras of functions on a curve with punctures. Also, so far as I know, no-one ever explicitly derives the relations of the Yangian from the conditions that it be a Hopf algebra quantization of the Lie bialgebra, but Drinfeld explains it in his article called Quantum Groups (Proc. ICM Berkeley, 1986). If you assume the coproduct takes a certain form on the Lie algebra (the most obvious choice given that it is a quantization of that Lie bialgebra) then impose the condition that the Hopf algebra coproduct be an algebra homomorphism then you can derive the relations of the Yangian in the first presentation term by term, using the fact that it is a homogeneous (graded) deformation. Personally I tried to do this but I found I had to assume little things along the way, like that the RHS of equation (13) in that paper is a symmetric sum of the orthonormal basis elements of the Lie algebra. I couldn't really understand why I had to do this, but I guess it's probably obvious to people who are smarter than me. At the end you end up with an algebra that you can then prove is isomorphic to the second presentation he gives, and then get a PBW theorem based on this presentation and verify that it is a quantization of the Lie bialgebra after all (I still working on understanding this part). Then given the uniqueness, which is meant to follow from cohomological arguments described in Section 9 of that same Quantum Groups paper, you don't need to justify any assumptions you make along the way. It seems that understanding the cohomology is key. 

Finally, and maybe most importantly, my friend Goro Kato tried to construct a derived category of $N$-complexes but managed to show instead that in reality one gains almost nothing with $N$-complexes instead of ordinary $2$-complexes, at least not from a homological perspective: From an $N$-complex one can construct, essentially in a unique manner, an ordinary $2$-complex. I don't remember the title but MathSciNet should solve that easily. 

I have an algebra $A$ that is finite over its centre $Z(A)$ and I want to compute the Azumaya locus of $Z(A)$ (or equivalently, its ramification locus). Looking in McConnell-Robson Noncommutative Noetherian rings (13.7.2 together with the Artin-Procesi theorem, 13.7.14) gives some criterium that can be used. However, this seems rather difficult since it means computing PI-degrees or the central polynomial $g_n$ which seems to me quite complicated. Are there any other, easy ways to compute the Azumaya locus? As should be clear by the question, I'm very far from an expert in this area, so the question might be very naive or elementary. 

Since your interest is in deformation theory I would advise you to have a look at "Introduction to singularities and deformations" by Greul, Lossen and Shushtin. The first part of the book treats complex analytic geometry (complex space germs) and the second their deformation theory. There's also a survey paper by Palamodov "Deformations of complex spaces" in Encyclopedia of Mathematics (Springer) which treats some foundational material as well. Good luck! 

I'm interested in covers of modular curves (especially cyclic covers) and I'm sure there's a lot of information out there available on this topic. However, I'm unable to locate any literature (on Google or MathSciNet). Anyone has any references? Edit: In response to the comment below, I'm particularly interested in the local properties of the cover. For example, how, if at all, Heegner points or supersingular points, translate into properties of the fibers over these points. 

I'm a bit confused concerning tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes. I guess they would reduce to tamely ramified extensions of number fields, but they don't seem to do so. Let me elaborate: First of all, let me recall the standard definition of tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes (by which we mean connected, flat, regular schemes of finite type over a Dedekind domain, or $\mathbb{Z}$ if someone prefer this). Let $D$ be a divisor on $S$ of an arithmetic cover $X\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$, where $A$ is a Dedekind domain. Then $X\to S$ is said to be tamely ramified along $D$ if $X\times_S (S\setminus D)\to (S\setminus D)$ is finite and étale and tamely ramified along $D$. Now, $X$ being connected and étale over $S\setminus D$ means that it is actually a $G:=\mathrm{Aut}_S(X)$-torsor (see Milne, Étale cohomology, page 40), that is, a Galois cover. Since being a $G$-torsor implies that $G$ acts freely and transitively on the fibers, the number of closed points in the fiber is equal to the order of the group $G$. But this means that the fibers all have the same number of points over $S\setminus D$. Ok, so far so good. Restricting to rings of integers in Galois number fields is where my problem begins. So, let $X=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_L)\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_K)$ be a cover of the associated arithmetic schemes to $L/K$. In this case, a divisor $D$ is a $\mathit{finite}$ sum $\sum_\mathfrak{p} a_\mathfrak{p} \mathfrak{p}$, $a_i\in \mathbb{Z}$. So $X\to S$ being tamely ramified along $D$ means that $L/K$ is at most tamely ramified at the primes in $D$. Outside $D$, the primes can be unramified, inert and completely split (in $L$). $\mathit{However}$, the only possibility, comparing with tamely ramified coverings of arithmetic schemes is that $\mathfrak{p}\in S\setminus D$ is completely split, but there are infinitely many unramified and inert primes by the Cebotarev density theorem. What the heck am I missing?
