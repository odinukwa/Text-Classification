Also, of course, as you've already noted, "Jews as mice, Germans as cats" can be seen as a symbolic representation of the Holocaust as a "cat and mouse" affair with the Germans hunting down the Jews. Interestingly, Spiegelman originally had this idea for an entirely different case of racism in a different continent: 

The narrator is reminiscing nostalgically about his carefree childhood spent in this place. He used to sing childish songs ("carols wild") there, which echoed off the rocks. Poetically, he "taught" these songs to the echoing rocks, who sang them back to him. With verbs like "taught" (or "gave", "sent", etc.) which can take both direct and indirect objects simultaneously, the indirect object always goes before the direct object in English. For example: 

In summary, the languages we've seen referred to are English, Frankish, Gothic, Celtic, Old English, Norse, and Latin. All of these were used to inspire Middle-earth names, since the primary language of the story is English and names originating from other languages were required in order to maintain the illusion that the book is non-fiction translated from the Red Book of Westmarch. So Tolkien had to draw upon a bunch of other languages whose influence is often seen in English. Hebrew is the exception, just as Dwarvish is an exceptional language in Middle-Earth: only distantly related to any of the other languages mentioned. 

Coming back to the point ... ... the passage you quoted sounds very much like how real mathematicians sound when trying to explain their work to laypeople. Unfortunately, because it's written for a lay audience, it's not enough for an expert to understand exactly what mathematical objects are being referred to here. The language of mathematics, above all, is precise, and most or all of that precision is lost when it's translated into an ordinary language such as English or Polish. If the imaginary narrator were speaking to a colleague instead of to a lay audience, he would be using strange letters and symbols instead of words that anyone can understand, and it would be easier for me to tell what actual mathematics is behind it. As it is, all I can do is make an educated guess at which mathematical objects are being 'approximated' by his rough description. 

The idea of incompatibility due to social status certainly comes up later in the story, in the context of the relationship between Polly Mooney and Bob Doran: 

In the story The Fifth Head of Cerberus, the protagonist - whose real name is never mentioned, so I'll just call him "Number Five" as his father and aunt do - is essentially an experiment of his father's. Towards the end of the story he learns that he is 

(For the record, the translation you quote in your question seems pretty accurate. Even without knowing Icelandic, you can see that a word-for-word translation would be something like "Now ride they home from the Thing, both sides, and ride they west past Hallbjarn's beacon.") So the original word is Hallbjarnarvörðum. Plugging this into an automatic translator, and adding spaces appropriately, gives something like "Hallbjarn guards" or "Hallbjarnar watches" or "Hallbjorn beacon". Searching Google for "Hallbjarnarvörðum" reveals that it's a real place in Iceland: 

Something about Milverton and the nature of his crimes touches Holmes in a way that few criminals can. Note that Holmes doesn't say he's the most dangerous man in London (a title which, if memory serves, he reserved for Moriarty, with the second most dangerous being Colonel Sebastian Moran), but the worst. This is a highly subjective evaluation, and likely based more on Holmes's personal revulsion than anything else. Allowing himself to make judgements based on his feelings is somewhat out of character, true, but we see from Watson's line above, not to mention his engagement and burglary later on, that he does act somewhat out of character when it comes to Milverton. To summarise: Holmes's evalutation of Milverton is (rather uncharacteristically) based more on his immediate feeling of disgust than a long rivalry with the man. 

I'll now discuss various possible pairings among these poems, but bear in mind that there's no definitive answer to this. Arguments could be made for many different ways of pairing up, and we're never going to have a perfect bijection. It's almost an exercise in combinatorics! 

There may also be a deeper significance in the connection, via hexagonal cells, to bees and their hives and society, as discussed on this awesome website. Like the bees in their hive, the librarians in Babel have little individuality or will to exist outside of their society/home. The bees crawl from cell to cell making honey; the librarians wander from cell to cell examining books. Philosophers from Aristotle to Karl Marx have likened humans to bees in their socieities and activities. Perhaps the library is intended to be likened to a beehive: strictly structured, containing numerous largely similar inhabitants, but full of sweet words instead of sweet honey. 

Because the Nobel committee felt his writing expressed "universal human conditions". According to the official Nobel Prize website: 

Some parts of the text suggest she was thirteen ... I found this article, which summarises an analysis by Russian sexologist A. Kotrovsky and columnist E. Tchernych and concludes that Tatiana was probably only thirteen: 

Note that even in this rendition, there is no question mark at the end. If the meaning was "why enlarge the coin?", then there should certainly be a question mark. If the meaning was "why, enlarge the coin!", then it could do perfectly well with just a full stop instead of an exclamation mark. To summarise: the surrounding context, meaning, word choice, and punctuation suggest that "why, enlarge the coin" is the correct interpretation; furthermore, the sources which have "why enlarge the coin" tend to be less reliable. 

I'm no expert on this poem, but having read its first chapter (the first four stanzas, "The Burial of the Dead") several times, poring over individual words and sentences, I came up with a couple of possible interpretations of the "heap of broken images" based on context from elsewhere. Tarot cards The third stanza is all about one "Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante" and her tarot cards. These, of course, contain images and can be piled in heaps, so the "heap of broken images" could be an earlier reference to tarot cards. Furthermore, let's look at some of the specific cards mentioned: 

The first published English version I've been able to find was a translation of this speech published by the New York Philosophical Society in 1946. You can read it in full here, along with a short analysis of how this translation differs from the more direct one done by Marcuse. It was withdrawn from publication on 5 Aug 1946 after rumours appeared that Niemöller had supported the Nazis in the 20s. Niemöller gave another speech a few months later, on 3 July 1946, entitled "Der Weg ins Freie" or "The Path into Freedom", as part of a series organized by the Ministry of the Interior of Württemberg and Baden. You can read it here along with an English translation and some analysis by Marcuse. This speech is sometimes claimed to be the origin of the "First They Came ..." quotation, but those precise words do not in fact appear there. I haven't been able to track down when those exact words were first published, but in any case, the spirit of the poem is there in the speech quoted above, which was delivered in German before it was ever translated to English.
