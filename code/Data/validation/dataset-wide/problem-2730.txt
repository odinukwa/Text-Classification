Because God wants us to be totally involved. So human have free will, can talk, behave and act; God wants our cooperation, because for a relation two persons are needed. Nevertheless God can give us something that we did't ask for, but this isn't always the case. 

Descartes teached that because he thinks therefor he is. But did he tell something about the question whether there are gaps between thoughts? So probably we could not exist between those gaps? Or wasn't it possible not to think or was thinking just a quality a human posesses? 

Robots can become very intelligent. So suppose in future they are there and looks and behave a bit like humans. What question could be asked by which you can decide whether it is a robot or not? 

Perhaps more a physics question, but there is also a philosophical question why physics validate all measurements as the same. Of course one could ask why should one particular measurement be the only 'real' one. Of course this is all about special relativity. But a bit in line of Ockhams'razor one could also suggest that the measurement with the less variable parameters should be the most right one. But if one measure the length of something with a ruler just laying it besides it, it should be a more accurate measurement of the length of something than of the measurement of a observer in motion relative to that length. But in physics both measurement are equal in validity according to SR. Only light is absolute. So the question is, isn't a measurement with less variable parameters not more accurate than one that is depending on the observers'conditions? 

I know that, at least, in my moral theory, there's no action that can be taken to remove a life forms rights completely. However, developing life forms capable of sacrificing more easily and readily for the collective would seem to me to be a moral pursuit in an environment where sacrifice is necessary. In the case of the Restaurant, since technology should've developed to the point where sentient life no longer must sacrifice other life to survive, I don't believe there's any way the cow could be killed morally. In this case, I would use advanced simulation technology developed instead of the cow to convince people that they are experiencing what is described in the book, but are actually just be induced into a certain mental state. I think that answers a few angles of the question. Hope that helps! ================================================================================== Moral theory in question: 

Not that any member of the set that never transitions from not yet existing to existing is not a part of everything, a contradiction, and there was once (presumably) nothing, so all members of everything experience at least one state transition. Ah hah, no we're getting into the subtleties of grammar. Is the Statue of Zeus a concept? In which case, the concept still exists. Is the Statue of Zeus an arrangement of matter? If so, no matter still exists in that arrangement, but the actual nature of the arrangement still exists as a possibility. Is the Statue of Zeus a specific incidence of an arrangement of matter? If so, then that specific incidence has experienced in second transition into formerly existing. So let's take members of the set of everything to also have the following attributes: an arrangement (for concepts we can use bit-modeled neural arrangements) and an incidence. So every member of the set of everything has a state, an arrangement, and an incidence. Take anything to be a member of the set of everything that is either in the state of not yet existing or formerly existing. Then anything does not exist but is still anything because it exists at another point in time. Similarly, the corollary for space would bundle a location with a member, so that if the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were moved to say, Missoula, then the Statue of Zeus at Olympia would no longer exist and therefore not exist, even though a member of everything with the same arrangement, incidence, and state would still exist. Alternatively, incidence could be tied to location. 

Some atheists believe in a form of "mandatory" naturalism. That is, they believe everything has a natural explanation---and unexplained phenomenon are simply events which lack a complete explanation at this time. Others have a more "skeptical" naturalism, where everything is assumed natural in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary. This view seems to predominate among educated atheists. In practice, it can be difficult to tell these positions apart by casual observation. In both cases, the standard reaction to any mystery will be a scientific or forensic investigation. It is debatable whether these attitudes constitute axioms/dogma, circular reasoning, or justifiable beliefs. That would depend on the specific beliefs of each atheist. And, for the record, your definition is fatally flawed because it is possible to be an atheist and reject naturalism. One could believe in ghosts, the zodiac, planar energy, transcendence, or magic without believing in any sort of deity. If gravity and electromagnetism require no god, why should telekinesis and astral projection? 

Other methods of knowing things may not be universal or applicable in all cases. Some, such as deontological morality, rely on personal experiences, paradigms, or norms which may not be shared---and, in some cases, cannot be shared. Others, such as mathematics/informatics rely on axioms which may not apply to our physical, perceptible world. Empirical truths are, in some sense, the greatest success of philosophy because they can be accepted by anyone with an open, critical mindset. The primary problem with empirical truths is their limitations. There are many questions which we feel are important that cannot be answered by any empirical test. Many important questions have very few empirically-supported claims which can support an answer at all. It is seriously questionable whether empirical facts can ever fill these gaps. 

I think it is a kind of idealism like that of Berkeley. But can this statement also belong to phenomenology of Husserl or of the philosophy of Kant or is there perhaps a better philosopher for this? 

Using mathematics a lot of 'laws' of nature are discovered, like the Higgsboson gravitational waves Diracs anti-matter etc. But if something like mathematics can predict how nature or reality 'should be' and is what does it say about the nature and reality. I sometimes think that if mathematics is usefull than the reality is perhaps symmetric and in balance or something like that. But is maths just putting a model on nature and you will find what you are looking for with the instruments and maths you use or does it really say something about nature? 

According to his theory there is only one substance and that is God/Nature. But if God is only good can there be any evil or bad behavior etc.? 

With levels I mean different 'perspectives' on a subject/happening. For example, all things have color. When we see a green tree we say this tree is green. So from this level the tree is green. But for a physicist the tree has no color it only appears as a color but in fact they are waves reflected by the tree are 'mentioned' green. So for a phycisist only waves 'are'. Now there is a mathematical physicist and says, no that are no waves that are fields and vectors and a string-theorist says that the tree is a bundle of strings. And perhaps even a synesthesist would say the tree is color 6. Perhaps you could go on and on. The question is now whether these 'beings' are valid or not. Can 'beings' who are not really contradictory be all true in their own field/level or -is- there a real being what prohibit the other beings? See also min 34 $URL$ 

I think that perhaps the biggest point here is that chemically identical but ethically "clean" dairy products could be developed using humane methods, and this would allow consumption with no ethical ramifications. However, that isn't immediately viable or what you're asking, so I've attempted to address your sub-points more closely. a) To borrow from economics, animals could reasonably be held to own everything they produce themselves. I believe that technology is the long term solution to no intervention: eventually we put all the humans in spaceship and fly off, leaving Earth as a nature reserve (maybe clean it up a bit first). The costs of doing this immediately would be incredibly high, even just measuring in terms of animal welfare, but in the mean time I believe equal consideration is a fairly reasonable guide as a global utilitarianism (across species). As plants don't implement nervous systems, they can be reasonably held to either have no utility curve, or at the very least, the worst possible endocrine distress a plant can experience can be held to be less costly than that of any organism with a nervous system. I would argue that equal consideration does hold for plants, it's just that they experience pain and utility to a lesser extent due to their structure's natural tendency toward stoicism. b) Reproduction and associated overhead are not zero cost processes, that is, even if there is sufficient milk for offspring, a maternal mammal would still have to more rapidly deplete her body to provide additional milk. As this is nonconsensual by definition, it is relatively difficult (but not impossible) to defend morally. Attempted defense: It is important to consider that this probabilistically increased milk production and associated body degradation is a low cost operation, and violation of rights in this case may be globally optimal in equal consideration as, for example, the provision of milk for a human caretaker may be considered a form of mutual welfare or a service purchased with labor. In some cases, the greater good invalidates the need for consent. Just as paramedics are permitted to assist unconscious patients incapable of communication, it is not unreasonable to argue that a non-consensual partnership between humans and other animals is not just ethically acceptable, but possibly necessary. Perhaps a better example is the idea of spaying and neutering cats and dogs- non-consensual, a violation of individual liberties, but generally considered a moral mandate. As mentioned earlier, eggs are an even more difficult argument, but it could still be made. 

You create evidence which should persuade any reasonable person of the veracity of your claim, You provide him a method by which he can verify those claims himself, and Your demonstration exposes underlying assumptions and sources of potential error so that your claims can be corrected by subsequent empirical tests if necessary 

In short, the primary appeal of empirical truth is its universality. If you can observe a fact or demonstrate a theory empirically, you effectively accomplish three things (assuming you use scientifically valid methods): 

Human perception is known to be unreliable and occasionally faulty. This supposed problem is not a significant concern. A materialist would simply reply that either PR or PB is inconsistent with reality, and further data would be necessary to determine which is inconsistent. A materialist would ask: What is the wavelength of the light observed by the twins? If it is not known, how was it produced? If the wavelength is known or reproducible, the materialist would then identify which twin had faulty perception. If the wavelength cannot be determined after the fact, then there is no way to know the actual color of the light during the event. Disclaimer: Wavelength is a property of light, but color is not. Color is a percept. In a certain strict sense, you could argue that both twins are correct, and that their perceptions map to different real properties. This is a bit disingenuous if we accept the assumption that everyone agrees "blue" is 450-495 nm light and "red" is 622-780 nm light. That assumption is necessary to imply any sort of contradiction in the twins' stated observations. 

Oh no, you asked an extension question about taking a position. Well that makes this harder. I would argue that being sufficiently informed to produce a position on any issue will necessarily introduce non-zero bias. However, we may be able to further refine our answers. For example, perhaps we can eliminate one of the above cases with the following definition: 

All crime is preventable by government. Implement nuclear holocaust, exterminate all human life, crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Well, maybe that's not what we want to do. Maybe we want government to guarantee certain rights. Say one of those is the right to life (the government loses the death penalty). Sterilize all humans. Wait for the second to last person to die. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Okay, maybe we need a right to procreate. Distribute all humans in such a manner they can never interact with each other, but provide for IVF. Without the possibility of any human interaction, all crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Perhaps we want to have a right to live anywhere we choose. Sedate all humans such that they are incapable of any action. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. This method requires autonomous care-takers. These might seem like unreasonable arguments, so I would ask - what is the fundamental philosophical difference between between these methods and a totalitarian police state? To me, there isn't one, and one of the reasons I think this question even came up is that some people today live under governments that do not guarantee sufficient rights that they have rights as a reason to not guarantee zero crime. The point being, all crime is preventable by government. What then, are the restrictions on crime prevention:
