Strapped-pedals are generally frowned upon for some strange, unknown reason. However, I would do away entirely with them, and instead, make sure I'm using correct foot positioning. Correct positioning on the pedals is pretty much all the clipless shoes achieve, aside from slight raise from pedalling too, but this advantage is somewhat negligible. I went clipless, and loved it, great for pure power riding. Then I went to straps and found it a pain trying to get the straps to the right tension where I could pull my foot out and push it back in with ease. I then went back to standard metal-teethed pedals and a foot positioning similar to clipless pedals and then wondered why I even bothered with the others.... It's personal opinion really, but I'd say scrap both of them. :) 

Protects the chain-stay from the chain itself when taking the wheel out, be it for cleaning or whatever. Also stops the chain slapping it on bumpy roads or descents. Not sure what you'd call it, I'd just call it a chain-stay protector. Some people use what's called Helicopter tape for the same purpose, too. I'd keep that thing on there, it then looks like the bike has a decent amount of protection from other components, and many mountain bikers respect that. 

I HIGHLY doubt this, but it could be possible that you are running a compact chainring set-up on cranks originally set up for triple chain-rings. I derped around with this before, and noticed that the chain would slip from the big-ring into a void between the two chain-rings and make you spin endlessly, creating a horrifically loud and embarrassing grinding noise. It's probably 100% not this, but for other people with this same problem, check this. Make sure the gap is not more than or equal to the chain, otherwise you could have a triple crank with a double chain-ring set-up x3 AGAIN, highly unlikely. Not joking, this is probably impossible for you given what you said, but it's something possible for others, plus quite amusing for some readers to hear about a few derps. 

This is a sticky one to tackle. Firstly, we don't know the terrain you're riding in, we don't know if you're going to commute to work/school/college/university and we don't even know exactly what your budget would be. As for a Single-Speed, why specifically? You could lose weight on a road racer or a mountain bike, or even a BMX. Anyhow, if your budget is low, you can look on eBay and try your luck, or you could perhaps buy a bike from a local bike-shop that has been refurbished. I personally always buy refurbished bikes because they're a fair bit cheaper than new. For a cheap bike, don't go for ranges like Sports Direct or Tesco's or any other superstore bikes like that, as they're usually badly made and have little to no grease in any bearings, which is very bad! Just look at BikeMan4U on YouTube to see what I mean. A fixie with a Flip-Flop hub would be good, as it gives you a choice of what you'd prefer to run around on. 

When transporting a bike on a bicycle rack behind a car, there's all manner of bicycle-destroying grit, grime and chemicals that can get to your bike's components. Whether it's snow and salt or mud and oil, it can all cause damage to the workings of your bicycle. This means, then, that protecting your bike is the number one priority. The best method to protect the bike is using a simple cover over the bike. This will stop rain, snow and any dirt from getting to the bike. This is probably the most common way! However, there are some drawbacks; Water, when it evaporates, can condensate within the cover if it's waterproof. They also don't help paintwork when in windy situations. I had a gorgeous red road bike which it's paintwork was brutally damaged by the cover after a 300 mile drive, and the bike had never looked the same again. 

Hmmmm, it sounds like (to me) that you may have a spacer missing behind the cassette on the freehub body for the whole thing to be moving a bit. Also try unscrewing your high limiter screw ever so slightly (about a quarter of a turn) just to see if the noise starts to disappear. (Note, you'll have to change gear and then back in again to get it to deadzone as I call it.) (I usually call the highest gear a dead-zone gear because there is no force from the cable acting on the derailleur to keep it there, making it rest against the limiter screw.) It may or may not also be from the derailleur jockey wheels being so far away from the cogs; Has your B-tension screw been set accurately? The tooth of the jockey wheel should be about two millimeters away from the cog when it's on the lowest gear, depending on where you're looking at the reference point. I'd personally reccommend taking it to an LBS if you still can't figure it out; It can take a fair bit of experience to try and diagnose things like this, but if you're not face-to-face with the problem, there's not much that can be gleaned from this. What you perceive as a tapping could be a ticking to me. Or a squeak could be a squeal. It's how each person would personally describe a sound, which is what makes online assistance hard. If you want to test to see if it's the spacer that's causing the problem as a temporary check method, get a pop bottle, cut it and lay it flat, cut a circle the correct size to fit on the freehub body and test it. Actually, whlist you're at it, check your rear derailleur hanger; if it's out of whack slightly, it could mean something is rubbing where it wouldn't normally, and may not be to do with the hub at all. (Though, the cassettes moving still does cause concern.) When reassembling the cassette onto the freehub body, I redidculously highly recommend using Lithium Grease on each component, between where each plastic spacer meets the cogs of the cassette. This grease is very, very light, does not clump as much as others, and is very handy for the fact it's bright white, so you can clean it off of your brake components if ever it flicks, which it shouldn't if you put a thin layer on. :) 

On a full-suspension bike, the rear chain- and seat-stays are attached using pivot points. However, what attaches to the dropouts on the chainstay? The wheels. The chain's route is constantly changing as the suspension travel changes. If the suspension is fully compressed, the distance from the wheel to the pedal decreases. If the suspension is fully de-compressed, the distance increases. This essentially changes the amount of chain links between each side. If the increase is sudden, which the back wheel moving at a constant rate, it'll either increase the free-hub/wheel speed or will 'kick' the pedals back. It's an un-nerving feeling, but it essentially means that you're, in a sense, pedaling without actually pedaling as your force downwards is kind of amplified as though your gearing has temporarily changed. However, when the frame pivots re-extend, they usually over-extend before settling, undoing all that awesome work that the pedal-kickback has just done for you. This is a painfully hard topic to explain in words, and is usually only suitable to be taught using illustrations and videos, so here's a photo I've found from the internet: 

For setting off on Recumbent bikes, you can use your hand on the floor to hold yourself up. May I confirm you're changing gears and setting off in a low gear, working your way up through said gears? If not, that could seriously inhibit your setting off; The faster you accelerate, typically, the more stable your set-off. With recumbent bikes, I highly doubt that training wheels would work well at all, let alone FIT the bike. If you have a Recumbent bike, make sure you set the gear limiters and indexing very, very accurate as you'll find yourself using the gears A LOT if you're fluent enough with the gear-to-speed ratio, so-to-speak. One final note on a recumbent with stabilisers; If you buy a bike stand designed for mounting on the chain-stay, that attaches via clamp, you might be able to mount it to part of the frame. If you take that stand and a little dolly with you to a garage and ask if they'd be able to weld something up for a fee, they'll most likely hook you up, and then you can attach that to the frame, come to a stop and lower the stand ready for when you set off, pulling it up when you've reached a 'stable' speed. Tried this on a bike with a trailer that I had welded up to pull/carry 300KG, which was ridiculous, and it had an electric-assist motor for going uphill! This stabiliser technique may just work for you, though it might be a bit of a pain to get this idea to fruition. I hope you enjoy your Recumbent, ever since I made the jump to road bikes, I missed the increased raw power output, acceleration and speed that you just can't get on an upright bike, heheh. 

DI2 is an electronic shifter. This is not really necessary for fun or exercise, a good old cable groupset will do. I always use old shifter sets that work simply because I don't race. I'd buy something cheaper than the Dura-Ace 9k, I'd go for Shimano 105, I personally find they feel exactly the same other than really slight mechanical habits such as feeling slightly looser than the Dura-Ace, but that's negligible compared to the price and the value out of it. If anything, stick with a cheaper groupset, you won't need the other fancier ones. 

That's the fork steerer. The fork has to be replaced if you want it taller. That, or perhaps, you could add another spacer to gain a marginal 10/20mm.... Replace the forks if you're desperate. Once you unbolt the stem, the forks can just drop out if you're not careful. Replacing the forks may not be economical to replace, and if so, I'd replace the whole bike. Good luck. :) Actually, having said that, the steerer is already ridiculously high; I'd recommend time to replace the whole frameset, as making it too high can be dangerous, if not deadly depending on when and how it breaks. If you're going downhill and the steerer snaps from being too high and too much force going through it, it can shatter or snap, and if you fall on that, it will seriously injure you, if not killing you. Replace the frameset rather than just the forks. The whole bike looks too small for you. 

I find a pair of well-fitting shoes is great. A perfectly-fitting pair, however, is the definition of bliss. With cycling, getting an accurate size can make the difference between having slightly achy feet or no aches at all. I find they make a huge difference to me, being 10.5. 10s fit (kind of) but pinch too much, whereas the 11s tend to be a bit too baggy for my preference. The 10.5s are the best pair of shoes I've bought for cycling. 

You need to tighten the cable. Also, check that you're not missing a limiter screw, because that looks plain dodgy. Once the limiters are set up, follow these steps: 1)Set the gear shifter in the highest number (6/7/8 whatever your maximum is). 2)Undo the bolt pinching the cable, the bolt with the spanner on it. This will allow the cable to move freely (if it's not seized up and if you've loosened it enough. But, don't let it go all the way through! 3)Then push the derailleur manually to the biggest cog whilst turning the pedals and wheel. Push on the 'O' of 'SHIMANO' on your particular derailleur, and it will move the derailleur, and in turn, chain onto the biggest cog. 4)Allow the slack of the cable through and make sure it's sitting in the inset. Then set the clamp bolt down tight. About as tight as you can with a small 1/4" ratchet from the head of the ratchet. Note, it'll work the same with your nut-style pinch clamp like this pinch-bolt style. 5)Then, let go of the derailleur and hopefully it'll drop down near the smallest cog. In this image, this is what the bike mechanics where I work call 'Non-Limited'. If it DOESN'T sit on the smallest or second-smallest cog, keep repeating steps 2,4 and 5, pushing the derailleur up to the second largest cog, and then the one next to it each time until it sits on the second cog when you let go. If when you let go, it goes to the second smallest cog, screw in the barrel adjuster until it aligns with the very smallest cog. Then proceed to tighten and loosen it as you need until the gears shift into each cog accurately and easily. Very good luck, and if you cannot do this yourself, give it over to a mechanic. I'd personally give it a go if I were you. If you manage it, great! You've saved yourself some money. And if you mess it up, there's not much that can go wrong, nothing is going to really break. You'll just be stuck at square one and need to take it to the mechanic, which is the position you were already in anyway. :)
