The major disadvantage of a backpack over a messenger bag is the need to take it off to get into it. 

With some racks, especially racks that hang the bike from its frame, Rack-Rash is a thing you learn to live with as its practically impossible to prevent. The price of cheaper racks is often (but not always) cosmetic damage to bikes. In my experience, to prevent bikes getting trashed in transit, they need to be supported by the wheels using a quality rack design. Google "Wheel Support bike rack" for some good examples. I like ones such as the Yakima FrontLoader or Thule 594XT Sidearm that hold the wheel, not the frame - similar setups are available for rear racks. 

If you are doing this to get a better Enduro and a Better DH bike, I believe this is a really bad idea. If you are doing it because its fun and you want to play and learn about bike building, dive on in, but be prepared fro less than stunning results at higher than expected prices. Given the manufacturers are fully aware most people have an S ( refer Rule 12 ) of 2 or 3, they spend a lot of time producing a wide range of bikes that in their range, there is one that will as close to a perfect compromise of price/performance/style for everyone. Unless you are a very skilled rider, and a skilled bike builder (not assembler) I believe it's bordering on arrogant to think you can do better cheaper. The other issue is the bike components them selves. Would you rather have a $500 enduro fork and a $500 Down hill fork, or a single $1000 fork. My money is the single $1000 fork will do both jobs better. Same applies to wheels, gear sets..... If you have done all that, and still feel the bike is the limit factor of your riding, you probably need two bikes. 

I get the impression when you hit the road its full out 110% effort for the length of the ride. I would suggest from the "lungs burning" description that you are over training and exercising above your anaerobic threshold. You don;t say how often or how far you ride. First up - your cadence is way too low and you risk damaging you knees. Go for a series of rides with the sole purpose of learning to spin at a cadence of at least 90. If possible, do this on the flat and slight down hills. You also need to ease off and focus on long distance endurance, then introduce interval training with short (30 second) sprints, with plenty of easy days and rest periods. I suspect you would benefit from a Heart Rate monitor and working out your VO2Max and training zones (I won't go into it, it too much for one answer), and working to a training plan based on it to improve your endurance (Strength comes after endurance) 

The spokes and gears are likely unrelated issues. You have done 2000km on the bike - have you replaced the chain and rear cluster yet? At you weight and those hill climbs, I would not be surprised if they are just worn out. It is also possible that at your weight and that distance the spokes have come out of adjustment, and/or now have fatiguied to the point of breaking or stripping threads on the nipples. I would also be checking for a broken axle and the bearings not being adjusted properly. The bike shops should have picked up all these issues, however, are they aware of the distance you are riding? Many such bikes do 50 miles a year and they may be servicing it based on that assumption. It is a mistake to presume that any LBS is competant, servicing is and art and a passion, and (putting it politely) some mechanics are better than others. What to do - ask around for recommendations on bike shop. If you are comfortable, take it back to one you have used, but make sure you let them know how much use the bike has had. Talk to the mechanic directly, don't be fobbed off by front counter salesmen (And walk out if you cannot get access to the mechanic). Ask him to measure the chain and check the cluster and chain rings. Check the spokes/bearings and axle. Be prepared to replace parts. 

Terminology is important here. Pedal Clips (refer here) are straps that tighten around the shoe. Clipless, such as SPD have a cleat - refer here Toe clips are not common these days - but still used by some (touring and fixed hub bikes) more niche applications. I assume you are talking about SPD style clipless pedals, but the following discussion does not really change if you are using clips. I do not believe they are dangerous. However, there is a learning curve - it's similar to asking "Is learning to ride a bike dangerous", in that you will get exactly the same answer. Do it in the right locations and take appropriate precautions, expect a few skinned knees and at very worst, a broken bone. Do it in the wrong location at the wrong time, at worst - death. What precautions - learn to use them in the same place you would teach a person to ride a bike. Avoid heavy traffic - no point falling under a B-Train - and mountain trails with large cliffs along side the track until proficient (Unless you are wearing a parachute) . i.e. Use common sense. Practice clipping and unclipping - and don't venture too far from your safe area until you can do both without looking down (If you look down at you feet, you will fall off). Then - practice "emergecy exits" - Not needed so much for onroad riding, but MTBing, you often need to unclip without expecting it. Eventually you will be able to unclip at any time, without thinking about it. Don't use mix the use of toe clips and clipless pedals - it will end in tears, as the exit methods used for of each is completely incompatible with exiting the other. Where not use them - anytime a fast, unhindered separation between the bike and rider is likely to be needed - BMX, Downhill MTB and Trials riding come to mind. In some XC riding, it is advisable not to clip for some sections - depending on the riders confidence and competence, however most of the time an XC rider will be clipped in. Some riders prefer flats - especially MTB - there is nothing wrong with that - don't feel forced into using clipless pedals. Edit: Updated in response to comments. In response to you photo and attached picture - not an entirely unexpected outcome of a novice to SPDs riding rocky ground, as might be expected putting a novice bike rider on same ground. Unfortunately you now have an additional couple of problems to overcome if you decide to go with SPD's. You will have a mental aversion to them, and to rocky ground - that needs work but is relatively easy to overcome compared to the other - If you go with SPD's your wife will be certain you are mad - nothing you do will change her mind on that.... I suggest not using beginner clips - they will install a false sense of security "I'm on beginner clips, I can un-clip easily....". However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with flats..... 

Why do you want to install rear discs? Keep in mind a decent set of disc brakes costs as much as this entire bike. The cost of making any improvements to this model bike is almost certainly not worth it. Best advise I can give is just do not go there. It results in an expensive, unreliable and often dangerous solution to a problem that does not exist in a majority of cases. If you want a better bike, sell it and buy a better bike. Even if you can put an adapter on to the frame, it affects wheel removal and makes all maintenance task twice as hard. You need a new hub - which practically means a new rear wheel. You won't be able to buy a rear wheel for less than the bike is worth second hand. 90% (100% if you read Sheldon Brown) of your braking comes from your front brake. A good V Brake will brake as effectively as a low end disc brake in 90% of conditions, and on the rear wheel, won't make a significant difference in the other 10% of conditions. 

Lets put some physics to play (mostly because I want to do some numbers....) Assume the brakes did all the work..... 200kg all up weight of rider, bike, trailer and kids. 350Meter vertical descent means you need to dissipate 700kJ of energy = 200WH. I found a reference to "Road and mountain brakes must absorb 75 watt-hours of energy over a 15-minute period without failure to be legal for sale in Europe" so will use it for my calculations. 200WH at 75WH/15Min is 40 Minutes. So assuming you spend 40 minutes doing the descent not to exceed the 75WH/15m limit of the brakes, and the the angle of the slope is 15 degrees, 350Mters is about 1.5km - you could safely descend the hill at no more than 2km/hour -seems too slow. Maybe that standard is 75WH/15m per brake - so you could twice as fast 4km/h. Even if other friction, tire scrubbing and aerodynamic losses (At that speed ?) were 1/2 of the energy loss - you cannot exceed 8km/h without over heating the brakes. But a cold set of brakes stores energy as heat - so what is the acceptable rate of energy dissipation after 15 minutes? As others have said, you boiled the fluid - replacing it is not going to fix the problem. If you do this again with the kids.... "Your gonna need a bigger brake"... duh da, duh da.... (...Movie reference...) In researching this answer I am now far more aware of limitations of my brakes - thanks....
