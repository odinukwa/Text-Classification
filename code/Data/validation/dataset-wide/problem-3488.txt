I am not sure exactly what you divided by what, but suppose your input-output table looks like this: $$ A = \left[ \begin{array}{lll} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{array} \right] $$ If you proceed to divide the first column by $\sum\limits_i a_{i,1}$ the second by $\sum\limits_i a_{i,2}$ and the third by $\sum\limits_i a_{i,3}$ then your new matrix will have 1 as an eigenvalue. (You can show this by showing that the norm of any vector is unchanging upon multiplication with the matrix by straightforward calculation.) This is problematic, because if $s$ is an eigenvector then $$ A \cdot s = s = I \cdot s $$ which implies $$ (I - A) \cdot s = 0 $$ which in turn implies that $I - A$ is not invertible (singular). So my guess would be that the problem is the division. I thought (incorrectly, see comment below) that input-output models usually deal in physical goods, not the value of physical goods, so the unit of measurement for $a_{11}$ would not be euros by say liters (of milk). In this case you would not have to divide the value of individual inputs by the sum of the value, but the number of goods used in the individual inputs by the total output of a good. This may make your problem go away. 

It is actually assumed that $b_i(v_i)$ is of the form $\alpha_i+\beta_i \cdot v_i$. So it is an affine function. Linearity only works if the bottom of the uniform distribution is 0. A somewhat intuitive reasoning is that if the valuations are uniformly distributed over $[c,d]$ and $b_i(v_i)$ is a symmetric equilibrium, then $b_i(v_i)+k$ should define a symmetric equilibrium when valuations are uniform over $[c+k,d+k]$ as neither the probability of winning nor the gain changes. Assuming a strategy of the form $\alpha_i+\beta_i \cdot v_i$ you get $$ =Pr[\alpha_1 + \beta_1 \cdot v_1 < \alpha_2 + \beta_2 \cdot v_2] \cdot ((1- \beta_2) \cdot v_2 - \alpha_2) $$ $$ =Pr\left[v_1 < \frac{\alpha_2 - \alpha_1 + \beta_2 \cdot v_2}{\beta_1} \right] \cdot ((1- \beta_2) \cdot v_2 - \alpha_2) $$ $$ =\frac{\frac{\alpha_2 - \alpha_1 + \beta_2 \cdot v_2}{\beta_1}-c}{d-c}\cdot ((1- \beta_2) \cdot v_2 - \alpha_2) $$ Taking derivative w.r.t. $\alpha_2$ and $\beta_2$ you get your first order conditions. Assuming symmetry you get a unique solution. If $c = 0$ then $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = 0$. By the way, I prefer treating $b_2(v_2)$ as the decision variable, then you can $$ \max_{b_2(v_2)} Pr\left[v_1 < \frac{b_2(v_2) - \alpha_1}{\beta_1} \right] \cdot (v_2 - b_2(v_2)) $$ and the last fraction is somewhat simpler. 

England will always produce good $x$. England may also produce good $y$. England will never export good $y$. 

Truth be told I am surprised they still have McDonald's restaurants in Venezuela, because long time president Chavez chastized US companies strongly and frequently and I think everyone associates McDonald's with the US. 

Initial endowments which can result in multiple equilibria in a pure exchange economy are explained here. Given a pure exchange economy, that is given the utility functions (which fulfil the usual properties) and total amounts of each good, what are some properties of the set of 'multiple equilibria endowment points'? Is this set connected? If yes, is it convex? Are there additional properties, does a charaterization (a set of necessary and sufficient properties) exist? 

Most of what you write is correct, but the definitions of the $F_i$ sets is imprecise. The problem is that in the core $A$ and $B$ may get goods that do not match their initial endowments. In this case it is not true that the core allocation $x$ is Pareto-efficient in the restricted 2-person economy of $A$ and $B$, because $x$ is not even an allocation in that game. 

So basically the question is: If I know the average ($\hat{\mu}$) of the daily temperatures ($y_i$) of last year, does that tell me anything about how many people were born ($x_i$) each day? Unsurprisingly the answer is no. The most you can get is the average of the $x_i$ series if you have the parameters of an unbiased regression between $x_i$ and $y_i$. 

Using Google is also free, yet the firm is quite profitable, so a possible solution could be ad revenue. Another solution could be that your sampling is off. E.g. most urban Democrats do not know many rural Republicans and vice-versa. It is similarly possible that people who do pay for porn do not move in your social circle. There is also an incentive issue to your sampling. This is a subject most people probably do not wish to discuss. As such you can reasonably doubt if you are getting honest answers. If one were to answer your question in the affirmitive, he would incur not only the stigma of watching porn, but also the stigma of having paid for it, which as you say is kind of strange given its free availability. 

Nominal means measured in present day money. E.g. someone in South Africa may have a monthly salary of 100,000 South African Rands. You have no idea how much this is unless you are told what real goods can be purchased from this. If a TV costs 10,000 Rands then the real wage of this person would be 10 TVs. Now you see the difference between nominal wages and real wages. If you reread your question focusing on this part: "The Wage(in terms of good we produce)" I hope all your confusion will go away. 

If I understand correctly the temporal dimension is merely a distraction as agents face a separate optimization problem every round with no intertemporal budget constraint. Hence \begin{align} & \max_{h_i} h^{\alpha_i}l_i^{1-\alpha_i} \\ & \text{s.t.} \quad h_i + l_i = \bar{T} \\ & h = \min\left\{h_i, h_{-i}\right\} \end{align} A continuous best response function exists for each agent: $$ BR_i(h_{-i}) = \min\left(\alpha_i \cdot \bar{T}; h_{-i} \right) $$ The equilibrium is $$ h_1 = h_2 = \min_i \alpha_i \cdot \overline{T}. $$ 

The word 'valuable' is not well defined in this question. If I am willing to buy an apple from you for \$1 and but I am only willing to sell an apple to you for \$4 which is more valuable: An apple or \$2? You cannot tell because neither option is sufficient to get the other option by trade. You are faced with the same dilemma in your problem. There are different prices at which to sell and buy so neither one of the options is clearly more valuable. EDIT: As @Adam Bailey points out in his excellent answer in this situation even though the exact value ratio is ill defined, it is clear that coin B is more valuable than coin A, because you can exchange one coin B for five coin A, thus you can get more by chosing coin B. 

Suppose the face value of a bond is $M$ and its interest rate is $\tau$. This means it will pay $\tau \cdot M$ interest every year (other periods are also possible) and at the end of its run (its maturity) it will also repay the face value $M$. Government bonds are usually sold in auctions. Whatever ends up being the market price is considered to be the present value of the bond. Using the cash flow you can also calculate the yield of the bond. If and only if the face value and the present value are equal the yield will be equal to the interest rate. For an example see the US treasury's website. Click on bonds to see face value, interest rate and maturity, click on the bond serial to see its price (present value). Further reading here.

Have a look at monopolistic competition. It basically details how many industries can find their own niche in a differentiated product market. Some prominent papers in the subject: 

This answer is in response to the edited (2015.10.16 ca. 12:30 CET) question. I think the concept of equilibrium means that given the circumstances you have no incentive to alter your behavior. (This is pretty much based on the Nash-equilibrium.) In this situation equilibrium consists of a price and an allocation of goods. Given the price everyone makes a trade decision. The decision has to be feasible both with respect to the budget and the physical availability of the goods, i.e. you cannot buy goods that do not exist. We are in equilibrium if everyone's decision was optimal (for themselves). In your situation for any $p_x \in [0,2]$ there exists an equilibrium allocation, where consumer 2 bought the good $x$ from consumer 1 for $p_x$ units of good $y$. There is no better feasible decision for either of them. If you were to adhere to the strict/dogmatic interpretation there would be no equilibrium at all, because for any $p_x <3$ consumer 2 wants to buy an infinite amount of good $x$ and for any $p_x > 2$ consumer 1 wants to sell an infinite amount of good $x$. Since there is no $p_x$ such that $p_x \leq 2, \ p_x \geq 3$ you could not have an equilibrium with finite amounts. 

You already accounted for multiplication by 4. Further multiplication by 100 to make the units of measurement percentage points? I.e. inflation is usually referred to as 3%, not as 0.03. 

An indirect proof. Suppose $$ x(p,w) = w\cdot x(p,1) $$ does not hold. This is equivalent with stating $$ U(x(p,w)) \neq U(w\cdot x(p,1)). $$ (To be precise: $x(p,w)$ and $x(p,1)$ may be set valued. In this case we are talking about two elements at least one of which is not included in both sets.) Case 1. $$ U(x(p,w)) > U(w\cdot x(p,1)) $$ As $U$ is homothetic $$ U(x(p,w)) = U(w \cdot \frac{1}{w}\cdot x(p,w)) = w \cdot U(\frac{1}{w}\cdot x(p,w)). $$ Using this we have $$ w \cdot U(\frac{1}{w}\cdot x(p,w)) = U(x(p,w)) > U(w\cdot x(p,1)) = w\cdot U(x(p,1)) $$ and thus $$ U(\frac{1}{w}\cdot x(p,w)) > U(x(p,1)) $$ However as $\frac{1}{w} \cdot x(p,w)$ is clearly an element of $B(p,1)$ this is impossible as $x(p,1)$ gives maximal utility in that budget set. Case 2. $$ U(x(p,w)) < U(w\cdot x(p,1)) $$ As $w \cdot x(p,1)$ is clearly an element of $B(p,w)$ this is impossible as $x(p,w)$ gives maximal utility in that budget set. Thus we have proven that $$ U(x(p,w)) = U(w\cdot x(p,1)) $$ which is equivalent with $$ x(p,w) = w\cdot x(p,1). $$ 

Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ denote the output of firms $1$ and $2$. I suspect by price function you mean the inverse demand function. So if $$ y_1 + y_2 = Y = D(p) $$ then $$ D^{-1}(Y) = p(Y) = p(y_1 + y_2). $$ Let us introduce the notation $$ MR_i(y_1,y_2) = \frac{\partial p(y_1 + y_2)}{\partial y_i}. $$ Generally $$ MR_i(y_1,y_2) \neq MC_i(y_i), $$ that is the functions are not the same. But if the outputs $y_1^*,y_2^*$ constitute an equilibrium, the functions take the same value. $$ \forall i: \ MR_i(y_1^*,y_2^*) = MC_i(y_i^*) $$ Another example: The function $x^2$ is not the same as the constant function 4. But if $x=2$ they take the same value. 

@HerrK. got it right in his comment (he should have deleted the somewhat confusing "yes" from the beginning and then posted it as an answer) It is possible that no pairwise improvements are possible but general Pareto-improvements are still possible. A simple counterexample for three actors and three goods is as follows. Let the utility functions be the same for all actors, that is $$ U_A(x,y,z) = U_B(x,y,z) = U_C(x,y,z) = \min(x,y,z). $$ Let actor $A$ have 3 units of good $x$, and 0 units of the other goods, whereas actor $B$ has 3 units of good $y$, and 0 units of the other goods, and actor $C$ has 3 units of good $z$, and 0 units of the other goods. No pairwise exchange can increase utilities above zero. But the goods could be distributed so that everyone has a unit of each. This would increase all utilities to one, making the original distribution not Pareto-efficient.
