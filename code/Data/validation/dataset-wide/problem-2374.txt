I can offer some basic advice on two of your points but I've never experienced the injury nor do I know a great deal about it unfortunately. 

If they still won't move then try a couple of times if they are still not moving then try heating and/or cooling the stick to break the bond. 

A tents job is not insulation. Your tents job is to provide shelter from wind, etc. Heat will (and should) pass though tent membranes very eaily. Therefore adding a tent inside a tent will add practically no extra insulation and therfore no benefit. The outer tent will protect you from wind/rain and provide shelter. The inner tent is doing nothing. 

(see the red dotted lines) Am I missing something here? This seems to be consistent when I've been checking this though the week. Why does this forecast only appear in advance? I'm defineatly not imagining this, the line that appeared 22nd Dec in the above images is now not there until 23rd Dec.... I don't get what's going on here? 

Applying for a schedule one license is (purposely) very difficult. Any nest locations are closely guarded secrets or under 24 hour surveillance. I saw one thread on a photography Facebook group that basically told one person asking that "No one is going to tell you this information". 

The first thing is to think very hard about whether you really need to cross it, in most circumstances the answer will be NO so there needs to be a strong reason to do so. DO NOT cross a river just because you are travelling in a straight line and the river is in the way. A river is a good source of water and, food and materials and they are an excellent guide to navigation as there is a good chance they will eventually lead you somewhere useful. They are also an obvious marker for anybody looking for you. There is also a good chance that if you follow a river you will eventually find a road or path crossing it. If you have a tarp, bivi bag or heavy duty bin bag with you then use that to wrap your pack as well as you can this will both keep your kit dry and help your pack to float. If you have water bottles empty and re close them, they will be useful flotation devices also inflate any plastic bags you have. IF you have rope or cord attach it you an anchor on the 'home' side of the river and your pack this gives you an anchor if you slip and and you can retrieve your pack if you fall and need to drop it. It may also be useful to cut a staff to help you. This should be a reasonably straight and sturdy piece of wood. This will both help you to support your weight as you cross and can also be used to probe the river bed ahead of you for any unseen obstructions such as rocks, sunken logs or holes, all of which are major potential hazards. In general you want to use the staff as a third leg, plant it somewhat downstream of your steps to support yourself against the current. Similarly walk with great care, keeping two firmly planted points of contact (feet of staff) at all times, only transferring your weight forward once you are sure you have a firm footing. Clothing requires some care. Here the compromise is between protecting yourself while you cross and getting your only insulating clothes wet. As a rough guide keep your boots on but remove your socks and keep on any wicking base layers and water proof shells which will dry fast and provide meaningful warmth during the crossing. However in cold conditions you should try to provide yourself with warm, dry clothing to change into as soon as you have completed the crossing. Also if at all possible be prepared light a fire as soon as you have finished the crossing ie find and dry-pack tinder kindling and fuel. 

Breathing technique is bar far the most important. Remember to keep your airways open at all times during descent and ascent, but most importantly during ascent. During normal dives you want to keep you ascent slower than the rising bubbles, while in a near continuous exhale, in deep dives you slow the ascent to half the speed of the air bubbles while exhaling. An air embolism is a SCUBA divers worst nightmare come true. 

It honestly depends on conditions and what you are trying to accomplish. If you have nice whittled shavings to start with, the make a log cabin of those, and slowly increase the size of kindling and finally logs added to the fire. If you have branches that are roughly 1 inch, then a teepee is better. Don't forget the star configuration. That 5 logs laid out radially, with a fire started in the center. As they burn you push the logs in closer to each other. It's perfect for cooking because you can control the heat, and it can maximize the lifetime of your fuel. There are lots of configurations depending on conditions like the dryness of your firewood, how big it is, is it split or solid, what are you going to use the fire for. Do you want smoke or smokeless, do you want lots of heat or do you just want light to keep animals away, etc etc etc. It's really too broad a question without knowing what you want to accomplish and under what conditions. 

Imsodin's answer is good and covers a lot of good points. One thing that is relevant here is Alpine boots come in 3 grades (to match the grades of crampons). You need to pick the right boot grade for the job you want it to do. Some trade off comfort (when walking) for ability when climbing. B1 B1 one boots are softer and allow the most comfort when walking. This softness comes at the expense of technical ability though. You'll find yourself using much more effort when using your crampons, you should also only use your crampons for short period of time as the softness stresses the joining arm in the middle of the crampon. Use these when your spending more time walking than using Crampons. B2 Harder than B1 but softer B3. These are what most winter alpine boots are. They're designed for using crampons for extended periods. They have some flex but it's limited. The trade off for better ability with crampons here is the comfort when walking (especially without crampons) B3 These are the stiffest. These are technical ice climbing boots. I wouldn't walk in these at all if you can avoid it. The soles will generally be solid. They are designed for front pointing with crampons on sheer ice. 

I would say no, because according to records, the strait is not even considered navigable except during short periods of slack tide. Does that mean a person couldn't survive? No certainly not, but I wouldn't bet my own life to try. 

So after all is said and done, I called a sand blaster, but they wanted too much money to blast my small hull. Like $1000. I could buy my own equipment to do the job for that price, but I didn't want to spend the money either way. My neighbor told me he had a blaster I could use, and when I looked at it, it was just another pressure washer. Well he said this one is a lot stronger. Anyway, I used his pressure washer and holy cow what a difference. His pressure washer blasted the paint right off. There are still some spots, but to be honest, it really did the job. What he leant me was a generac 3100 psi 3 GPM gas powered unit. It worked great and only took a few hours to strip the paint off the whole hull. Now all I need is to let it dry out so I can shop vac up the debris from my driveway. I just thought in case anyone wanted or needed to know that a powerful enough pressure washer does the trick. Bear in mind that it can and will strip the barrier coat and dig into the fiberglass if the spot is weakened, but considering I am looking to repair and restore this hull, that's just fine by me, if it comes off then I want it to come off so I can lay new glass and epoxy up and make it stronger. 

The most important thing for a firesteel striker is that it is hard and has a 'crisp', although not necessarily sharp edge. Stainless steel knives tend not to work quite so well as plain carbon steel ones. In general when you use the back of a knife as a firesteel it needs to be ground with a well defined square edge to the spine. Carbon steel files work extremely well and emery paper is pretty good (although a bit less durable than other alternatives) so the emery boards sold for filing nails should be a good option. Short lengths of hacksaw blades can be effective as well. Using an abrasive rather than a blade also has the advantage of being a bit safer for teaching. Emery paper or boards, tend to produce more sparks and are, in some ways, easier to use than a scraper type striker (eg the back of a knife). The difference is that emery does not 'throw' big fat sparks in the same way as a scraper so a slightly different technique is required. One good method is to wrap a strip of tinder around the tip if the rod and hold it in place by gripping it near the end. 

What's likely happened with yours is that somehow the wedge has gotten out when expanded, so it won't go back in because it's too wide. So you need to loosen then bolt and contracts the "wedge". You can do this using a pair of pliers. Basically grip the exposed end of the bottom pole and twist the pole (as though you want to collapse them). Be careful not to damage the locking mechanism and ensure you unscrew them, not tighten them up more. Eventually you should see the locking mechanism "wedge" contract and get thinner. You should now be able to put the pole back together. Hopefully nothing is broken and you can tighten them whilst inside. If not you can try and expand the "wedge" a little and try again. If they're broken, then they're broken though and you may need a new pole 

This is to prevent "flappers". A flapper (or avulsions) is when the skin has thickened in a particular area of the fingers, normally the tips, due to abrasion. The problem is the surrounding skin has not thickend. This means that when you apply pressure to the thickened section it can peel away, ripping the weaker surrounding skin. 

First things first. You need a sailboat in order to sail. A raft isn't navigated. It drifts and is blown around. If you have a sailboat you already have the navigation tools you need or at least most of them. Any tools that you can make on an island with a pocket knife will be no better than just looking up and recognizing the stars. The level of accuracy you would get from knife crafted tools would probably be less accurate that naked eye rough reckoning of the sun, moon and stars. Next comes knowing your latitudes and what weather to expect at those latitudes such as the doldrums and horse latitudes. Longitude is out of the question for this. You can't know your longitude without an accurate clock. So the best thing to do is follow the prevailing winds. And avoid going north or south too much. There generally speaking is no land to the north or to the south if you are in the Atlantic or pacific. If you are in the Indian Ocean then you pretty much in that case want to travel more northerly if you can manage it. 

When they are tight enough to prevent movement within the shoe/boot but not so tight that it causes discomfort. A little too loose is actually worse than a lot too loose. A little too loose will guarantee a blister, while a lot too loose will reduce your ankle support. 

A tab ground up to produce a powder will have a higher surface area, therefore the fuel is more readily available for burning, this is why you can light a ground tab using a flint and steel. The flint and steel produces less energy for a shorter period of time than a match or lighter so it needs access to more fuel initially to catch (think of the fire triangle, heat, fuel & oxygen, your not producing much heat so you need more fuel, the ground state allows the fuel to access more oxygen also, your almost starting lost of small fires that require less of all 3 elements...). The main problem I can see with keeping something in a ground state is that the added surface area also produces more evaporation (the tabs are volatile chemicals that evaporate away over time, that's why when you buy them they're sealed in plastic). So the ground powder is going to become less effective the longer it's in a ground state. How much of an effect this will have will depend; so a bit of trial and error is likely needed. I'd say your best bet is to grind them at the last minute or use an intermediate material to take the spark off your flint and steel first (tampons are perfect for this, they're compressed cotton wool, unravel them and strike the spark into the cotton, blow carefully into it until the cotton catches then introduce the cotton into your tabs). Another potential problem with this is the chance of contaminating your food:
