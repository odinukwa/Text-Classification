I'm sure that any trainer you'd talk to would also have plenty of suggestions. And finally, as for what's better for your aerobic health, really what determines that is getting your heart to a strong pace and keeping it there for as long as possible. Again, what heart rate specifically will vary from person to person - my target heart rate is about 145 bpm for cardio training. Yours would likely be somewhat less simply because I'm younger, and heart rates tend to slow as we age. Again, a trainer would be able to tell you for sure, but to get started without paying a dime, you can check out this site for some of the most vital numbers. 

The graphics on products like that aren't really meant to be looked at with the sort of detail you're reading. They're only supposed to provide a very broad view of how to not mess up horribly when taking the supplement - I have little doubt that if they didn't provide any usage instructions at all, there would be a considerable number of people who would try to take the powder dry, or try sprinkling it over their cereal or something. It doesn't work like that! The graphics and suggestions on the back are for usages a 'normal' person in a 'normal' situation. You'd be surprised how few people are truly 'normal' with those things. Your trainer knows best. We cannot really judge without knowing more about your workout and your calorie intake, so it's kind of up to you to find the specifics with the professionals and people you trust to know the details. Regarding your usage and if it's 'too much', if you're getting results then no, it's not! I generally prefer to drink only water while working out, but there's no research pinpointing ideal protein supplement use to my knowledge, so people are generally left to do what works for them. A better question would be, what is your primary goal? You've mentioned it's to burn fat and be stronger. But which one is more important to you? Since it's burning fat, then you might talk to a dietitian to figure out how your shakes fit in to your overall calorie intake; you will not lose fat if you are eating too much. There are a few other things you can do if possible to help your weight loss goal, which may or may not be possible since you're a very busy college student: 

This entirely depends on the specifics of your 'raw food' diet. Many people use raw food diets to describe a diet that is very low in artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other non-natural additives. Others use it to describe a diet where you simply don't cook anything. One makes sense, another absolutely does not. Finding research specific to your question is going to be very difficult, though. The annoying thing is that the question of whether a raw-foods diet is healthier for you is one of the easiest things to answer, but one of the hardest things to prove. Everything we know about the body points away from using the over-processed junk that's wormed its way into our food supply over the last 80-90 years. However, proving that this junk causes diseases in a controlled study is practically impossible because there are so many variables in human digestion that can't be properly isolated and eliminated. Even if you were to sustain an experiment group completely on TV dinners and noted a huge uptick in cancer rates, there's no way to say for certain what ingredient or system of ingredients in the TV dinners did it, or even that the experiment group wasn't just more prone to cancer to begin with. The best one can do at this point in time is to look at the what facts we do know about the human body decide what to believe for yourself. To more fully answer your question, I'll go over a few variations of 'raw foods' diets with some rationales you should find fairly simple to verify or disprove on your own. I would link a ton of websites but most of my learning comes out of textbooks given to me by health professionals - I can't easily make it available for Internet consumption due to logistics and copyright laws. "Basic" raw foods diets, where one simply cuts out things like high fructose corn syrup, preservatives like sodium nitrate, bleached white flours, and so forth should perform very well in children. Meat is cooked and consumed in this diet, and grains are used in a balance with everything else (instead of eaten heavily, like the 'food pyramid' plan). So, these are basic foods like spinach, eggs, milk, ham, beef, nuts, whole-wheat bread, and natural corn. There is no reason why this would not perform well in children because their digestive systems are getting precisely what they expect to get; nothing more and nothing less. The foods in this diet have been consumed for hundreds or thousands of years and there is absolutely no evidence of harm coming to their consumers (excepting special cases such as food allergies). The range of allowed foods provides all the things the body has been known to need, and a largely unaltered state. A variation of this one is the "vegetarian" raw foods diet, where one doesn't eat meat but does consume animal by-products like milk and eggs. This one needs a little more vigilance due to the voracious vitamin needs of children, but again does not pose any particular deficiency. A "Vegan" raw-foods diet has a few warning signs on it. In this diet, no animals or animal by-products are consumed. In adults, this can work alright if the adult does not have a big need for physical conditioning or labor. In children, muscle, bone, and sinew gains are guaranteed. The entire vitamin B complex is crucial for the growth and maintenance of these things and a vegan diet is critically deficient in it. A vegan diet can procure some parts of the B complex, but you cannot get significant quantities of real, natural B12 without consuming animals or animal by-products. B6 is also difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities to support a youthful growth spurt, though adults have much less trouble getting enough. "Vegan" supplements of B-vitamins are often derived from mineral or crystalline sources that your body cannot digest at all, so these too are no substitute. An 'herbivore' diet such as this one also doesn't make a huge amount of sense from a physiological standpoint. Most herbivores have intestinal tracts that are around 10 times their length from hip to shoulder. Humans fall short of this, usually around 6-8 times. Humans also lack the multi-chambered stomachs and specially formulated enzymes that most pure herbivores have to get the most out of their food. A "pure" raw-foods diet would be what Barbie was talking about above. Meat is eaten, but it is not cooked and eaten raw like everything else. For now, let's ignore the multitude health risks from routinely eating uncooked meat (as a matter of fact, I think this would be construed as child endangerment in many states in the USA). The practice of eating raw meat doesn't make sense from a cursory look at the human digestive tract. Compared to a pure carnivore, such as a lion, our average stomach pH is much closer to neutral and our intestines themselves have a smaller diameter, providing less surface area for partially digested meat chunks to be absorbed. Cooking is what allows us to get the maximum amount of nutrition out of meat for the least amount of risk. In fact, there are some theories that the extra nutrition from cooking is part of what made humans smart enough to form societies in the first place. Children have a very pronounced need for that extra nutrition, as they are physically growing on a near daily basis. Presenting that nutrition in an inherently harder to digest format does not seem to be a terribly rational thing to do. 

There is indeed some research that links sleep deprivation to a greater incidence of obesity, so it does not seem illogical to conclude that sleep plays some role in properly burning fat. There is also some other research linking sleep deprivation to hindered sports performance. There are better resources than the one I just linked on Google, but they appear to be screwing up and not loading at this time. I will update this answer when I see it working. For now, please accept the search term 'sleep deprivation athletic recovery' as a springboard for your own resource search. From a purely logical standpoint, all of this makes a lot of sense. Sleep deprivation, in many ways, mimics alcohol consumption. Alcohol's effects on athletic performance and recovery is well known, due to the disruptions it causes in both your digestion and your nervous systems. Hormonally, a lack of sleep also taxes your adrenaline glands, which now must pump adrenaline just to keep you at base line alertness. Properly rested, you would instead be using this adrenaline to meet your athletic demands. Finally, anecdotally, napping has been part of the training regimen for some sports for centuries. Sumo comes immediately to mind where junior wrestlers are woken up at 5AM, work hard for about 4-5 hours, then have a huge lunch and go back to sleep. While I'm not sure one would want to take weight loss advice from a sumo wrestler, I don't think anyone could argue that their musculature and fitness level is also very impressive.
