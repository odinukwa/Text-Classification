This is a question, where I start with some assertions: Try to consider the universe as a four-coordinate system, x,y,z,t where t is time and where we view a change in t as a change in position, and as a velocity in the same way as any other change in either of the other components of the coordinate. Everything is then moving at the speed of c. The difference between a photon and another particle would be that a photon "spends" its velocity in any of the x, y or z dimensions - but not in the time dimension. This implies that all photons are on the same coordinate in the t-dimension - only the x,y,z values change while t remains 0. It also implies that time would appear to stop for something travelling in only the other dimensions, while it would pass fastest for something completely stationary. You can then also consider space-time as a function of acceleration. A physical objects' coordinate could be derived from its velocity, which would have to be derived from its acceleration. Acceleration would be a function of entropy, or "age" I believe. Is this the basis of general relativity? Is it at least an initial starting point for general relativity, or is it completely wrong? Would spin have to be part of the coordinate system? 

When a particle travels through spacetime, this is sometimes illustrated moving in flat grid with various depths. How accurate is this way of imagining gravity? Can the gravity well be infinitely deep? Gravity well $URL$ Looking at this illustration, it suggests that there is an amount of distance going down the well. Is movement down the well limited by the speed of light? Remember, I'm aware that it is an illustration, and the question is about the accuracy of the illustration. Is all gravitational wells infinitely deep at the exact center? So that if a particle could be made small enough to fit within the center, it would become a black hole. 

Suppose an alien race fired a laser beam from the centre of the Milky Way, it went through the Sun and then off further out of the galaxy. What Constellation would the light beam head towards, closest star also if possible? Am not interested about how much devastation the light beam may or may not cause, just the journey and destination. Would that direction be the quickest/shortest way out of the galaxy if we had a spaceship that could travel that fast? 

Using data from Hipparcos is it possible to calculate Radial Velocity. If we take 19 Leonis as example, RV is -3.70. Is it calculated from Proper Motion? Can I ask that any formulas be done in long hand please, i.e. how you would enter it into a standard spreadsheet rather than with symbols etc. $URL$ Additionally Took the advice and found CRVAD2.dat ( $URL$ ). The following line comes from CRVAD2.dat file and when I looked up HipId 40829 which is below, the RV value is -3.70 which matches the link above. 

This series of records was taken from $URL$ . The records below are related to 70 Ophiuchi (hip 88601). Should I assume the lines that don't have a HipID as being part of the 70 Ophiuchi or just those with the HipId at the end? If I assume all but the bottom line is part of the 70Oph then its quite a big star solar system? I always thought Jabbah and AR Cassiopeia were the biggest multi-star systems. I did notice that there were other star systems like this such as S Monocerotis which had more (16). Essentially, the question is each line a star in the system or have I misinterpreted the data and that there isn't 13 stars in the system ? 

13 billion years ago, the universe was about 600 million years old according to many scientists. At that time, all matter in the universe would have to be closer, or in other words denser. Did time pass more slowly, at that time, relative to now? I ask, because increased gravity causes time to pass more slowly. If we'd been there, and measured the speed of light as we measure it today, would the speed of light be different? Finally, does distant stars look magnified, given that a "tiny" universe is stretched on our entire sky? I assume then that we'd measure time based on caesium 133 and distance not as a function of the speed of light, but as a theoretical physical "device" that would be the same physical length then and now. 

When a planet is spinning around its own axis, it has an effect on the trajectory of its satellites. I believe it is called frame dragging. Spin increases the kinetic energy of an object, contributing to its mass-energy, but some other effect must come into play as well. How does one differentiate between spin and orbit velocity? What is the effect of the spin? Lets say that Earth suddenly started spinning faster, what would happen to the moons trajectory? 

When matter crosses the event horizon, it is easy to imagine that matter is torn apart into their individual components by tidal wave effects. Atoms would be ripped apart eventually. At one time, the particles will fall so deep into the gravity well, that a single particle would be touching both sides of the gravity well at the same time. At that moment, I choose to assume that the particle particle core may be spaghettified, but externally it will appear to be shrinking. Knowing that spaghettification is dependent on the size of the object, as well as the difference in gravity on both sides, a shrinking particle may eventually become so small that the steepness of the gravity well is no longer a problem. The particle continues to shrink forever. Over time, gravity between all the particles that have shrunk, will again start to take effect - and I imagine that that is what happened in the big bang. So the cosmic inflation, could just as well be particle shrinking, as a result of all particles in our universe being within the same black superhole. Taking this idea, we could look at our own universe and I guess we would expect to see certain effects such as accelerating cosmic expansion, perhaps a cosmic background radiation and we would expect our universe to end as a cold, dead place. Is this a known theory or idea, and where can I find papers on it? 

If declination is the degree measurement from the celestial equator roughly the Earth equator unless I've misunderstand plane. "The celestial equator is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere, in the same plane as the Earth's equator." $URL$ Where is zero degrees for Right Ascension, is it the GMT Line or International Date Line or some other line? 

Is there a formula to convert the B-V index to U-B index or are they totally different and separate observations and can't be convert like you can with Fahrenheit->Celsius? (Updated) I know F->C is not astronomy related directly but there is a formula to convert between the two measurements. 

The star is located at a distance of 163,000 light years in the constellation of Circinus. As the Milky Way is 100,000 light years, this would then imply the star is outside the Milky Way? Would it be a data anomoly if that is the case or is it in another galaxy like r136a? Would it be on the far side of the galaxy, other side of the Galactic Centre? 

Is it possible to derive Metallicity/Age/Radial Velocity/Rotational Velocity/Surface Gravity of a star from Hipparcos data files or are do they require individual studying? 

What is the difference between Absolute Magnitude and Absolute Bolometric Magnitude, is it a case of multiply one by a constant to get the other? Can you give an example for a star, say Vega? 

You could check out Night Vision by Brian Simpson, its a Free application that you can download and install. I use it. You can then match what you see with what on screen and be able to identify ($URL$ I guess it might not be the answer you're looking for but if no one is able to answer, this could be the way to go. There's also Microsoft WWT and Google Earth too. 

It shouldn't matter if part of the planet is uninhabitable. There are deserts on Earth which are all but uninhabitable but that doesn't effect life elsewhere. Prior to 5.3 million years ago the Mediterranean sea evaporated and that entire region could have had a salty basin and been hugely hot, but I've not read of life on Earth having any problem with that.

High orbital speed, I suspect, makes little difference, in fact, a larger planet would have higher orbital speed in it's rings than a smaller one. A heavy Jupiter, 8 or 10 Jupiter masses and 2 or 3 times denser than the Earth could have a large orbital region inside it's Roche limit and potentially, very large, very fast orbiting rings. Hope that wasn't too long. 

@Chappo using your 7:4 4/(7-4) = 1.333 years to catch up, so that corresponds to 3 passes every 4 years, or, as you said, a triangle. For resonances and the number of points in the star-pattern, it seems to be a simple matter of subtraction as you said, because the denominator in your example is 7-4, or 3. Divide by 3, you then need 3 cycles to get back to an integer. 

If black holes have infinities, which is only possible if they have a singularity, then those infinities are, by definition, infinity small and not infinite from any distance away, even a fraction of an atom's distance away. So "destroy the universe by infinite forces", sure, if the universe was smaller than an atom, or maybe, inside the event horizon where it couldn't do anything but fall towards the singularity, but at any safe and reasonable distance, black holes aren't dangerous and not a threat to the universe. 

$URL$ displays R.A. on screen in hh:mm:ss format but when you export the table, it gives the R.A. as a decimal. Likewise for Declination. How can I turn for example 24.35417 (WASP-18) into 01:37:25.0 ? And likewise for Declination -45.67778 to -45:40:40? I'm looking for a method, not a website that will do it for me. Either a way to convert between formats or how do I export in non-decimal format? Thanks 

I've come across $URL$ and am trying to decipher the hip2.dat file to work out whether a star is a solo, binary or multiple star. Ideally would be interested in knowing how many stars are in the system but I'd be happy with just knowing if its (SBM) solo, binary or multi. What I don't understand is which item in the line identifies its companionship (SBM), I believe it its 8-10 but the value for 32349 is 0 when its widely known that Sirius is a double star system so I think I'm wrong there. I've deliberately excluded the names of the star. I'm not expecting the answers to everyone, I just need the explanation of how to decipher one line and i'll do the rest because I can't understand what they mean. Do the values under - d and -s refer to bitwise values of the value in 8-10? I know 49669 has 4 stars in its system, 32349 has 2 and 79374 has an alleged 7. The other descriptions of the other items in the list are about Parallax and Coordinates, nothing that appears related to the information what I'm after. All the stars I looked up are all either binary or multiple stars, I couldn't find a solo star, apart from the Sun (debatable).
