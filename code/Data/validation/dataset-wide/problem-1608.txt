The second figure is closer to the original 1 in 4 figure.The two sources do have different definitions of domestic abuse; the 2000 survey talks about rape and/or physical assault while the 2010 source also adds stalking. Even Though some of the sources that cite the 2000 study add stalking to their definition of domestic abuse. The 2000 survey does touch and expand on stalking in its body. 

Edit: Found a corresponding figure for the 20th century. Note the spread of the model runs (which is our best estimate of the plausible variability due to the unforced response) is pretty broad. There is no good reason to expect the observed climate to lie any closer to the modern GCM ensemble mean (or indeed GCM-Q) than that. 

(via woodfortrees.org). Now I know that cherry picking is bad statistics, so I would not make a claim about the trend from 1980 to 1994 being in any way meaningful based on a cherry-picked trend. The reason that I am doing so is simply to demonstrate that flat trends can easily be cherry-picked from noisy time series data if that is what you really want to do. Now the trend I have cherry picked is shorter than the one cherry picked in the diagram in the original question, but then again the one in the question has the advantage of the spike caused by the 1998 super El-nino event, which is basically what allows such a long trend to be cherry picked. This leads me on to the second bit of cherry picking, which is why the RSS dataset (derived from satellite measurements of the lower trophosphere) rather than a surface temperature dataset? I suspect because the satellite derived datasets are more sensitive to the effects of El-Nino, which is apparent if I plot the RSS and HadCRUT4 (an instrumental surface temperature dataset) together (I've added an offset so the differences can be seen more clearly). 

other reasons include nudity and sexuality, offensive to the culture, nationality or religion of the country and other various reasons. 

Countermeasures against it are taken in the IDF (Israeli Army). I have experienced in first hand that to classes, briefings or meetings where confidential material is talked about or revealed, all participants must suppurate their phone from its buttery, and if your phone doesn't allow this, e.g., the Iphone, then you leave it outside of the room. Here is an article (in Hebrew) talking about information safety in the IDF that tells the same thing: 

"CO2 is plant food" is a fairly common skeptic argument (this answer is adapted from the SkepticalScience article on that topic). The basic point is that additional CO2 is good for plants, provided they are in an environment where CO2 is a limiting factor in growth, i.e. they already have adequate water, sunlight, nutrients etc. This is why additional CO2 is sometimes introduced into greenhouses, where watering, sunlight and feeding are already well optimized. However outside greenhouses, CO2 is not generally a limiting factor. Quite often the low availability of water (e.g. due to drought) or poor soils (due to over-farming) is what prevents productivity, and adding extra CO2 is of little or no use to plants. CO2 however, is a greenhouse gas, and can be expected to produce warming, which may have a negative effect on water availability, and for some plants temperature is a limit on where they can grow. Simplistic arguments are generally unlikely to be true on this one as there are many factors that are involved. As an example where Dr Idso's argument clearly is not the case, consider this study: 

Which makes the total percentage of Jewish students in Harvard 15%. The number of Jews in the population is hard to find, as it's not asked in the US census. According to a New York Times survey: 

Yes it does, combined with the vibrations from the traffic on the street, and the shape of the statue's base: 

The only thing I have to say is WTF?!, electrons have mass, and so do protons, but charge is a property, it doesn't "carry mass" it's like saying that because things have length and color, then "length carries a color". There are 2 types of particles that have charge: leptons (electron, muon and tau) and quarks, each of those particles has mass and charge, but charge and mass are properties of the particle, not a particle by itself (protons and neutrons are made of quarks). This is particle physics material. If the meaning is that electrons have no mass, then yes, they don't have mass. Electrons have ~10^3 less mass than a proton, for all practical purposes, an electron doesn't contribute any mass to the mass of the atom. Since, again, we are talking with kids, and we don't calculate the mobility of different materials (Solid state physics), or about movement of individual electrons (Quantum Physics), then the approximation that electrons have no mass is good enough. 

The Coriolis acceleration is proportional to the sine of the latitude (see e.g. wikipedia) so the last place on Earth the direction of draining would be dictated by the Coriolis force would be a couple of meters from the Equator. So yes, we can be certain that the demonstration in the video is a trick, in the sense that it is not a legitimate demonstration that the direction of the vortex is governed by the rotation of the earth. The Coriolis effect is way too small to have created a vortex of that speed that quickly, and also the effect vanishes as you approach the equator anyway! The effect in this case is almost certainly due to the fact that the water is poured into the basin from the side that produces the desired vortex direction. This is something that was dealt with in the properly performed experiment by pouring the water into the vessel to create an initial rotation in the wrong direction, that would have to be overcome by the Coriolis force. 

There are other stores in that article that don't mention the bible as one of their best-stealer but there are a lot of stores where it is. It also happens in libraries, as shown in this transcript of a segment from On the Media: 

This lengthy process is in place to minimize the number of innocent people that will get executed as well as making sure that the defendant/inmate has exhausted all possible legal options to prove their innocence. In China, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq (3 of the other 4 world "leaders" in executions in the year 2011, together with the US), it's easier, quicker and cheaper to execute a person: China: 

I can't see where it explicitly gives an answer, but the take home message clearly implies a "no" (especially the third point) as far as I can see. 

The main canard implied in Easterbrook's video is the idea that because there have been large changes in (especially regional) temperature in the distant past, when there were no anthropogenic carbon emissions, then carbon emissions now are not causing the changes in temperature. This is a non-sequitur as both anthropogenic and natural forcings affect the climate, and climatologists know this and take it into account in their studies. They have also studies past changes in climate, such as the Younger Dryas, indeed such events are helpful in the understanding of climate. 

Don't listen to this advice, there is probably no one rule that can be applied to all situations involving hostile situations with weapons!!! 

Moreover, during the entire Korean war only 5 US ships were sunk by the North Koreans, all of them were minesweepers that hit mines: 

(Emphasis is mine) So it really depends on your interpretation of the law, I however, not being a US citizen or resident, tend to agree with prof. Volokh, because if in the future there will be a situation where a state or a territory will want Independence, and the rest of the USA will be willing to give it to them, then the secession will be preformed peacefully, if the USA will not be willing to grant it, then there probably be some sort of bloodshed. 

I think this paper suggests "no", but I haven't had time to look further than the abstract yet. Autoimmunity Reviews Volume 11, Issue 8, June 2012, Pages 585–588 Review Is fibromyalgia a discrete entity? 

Dinosaurs evolved in the Triassic and persisted through the Jurassic and Cretateous, and it seems that Oxygen levels have fluctuated considerably during the time, but for the most part were higher than they are now. If lung efficiency was the issue that caused the dominance of the dinosaurs it seems odd that this continued through the Cretaceous where oxygen levels were apparently generally higher than they are now (why didn't any other groups evolve similar compensatory mechanisms given the long timescale available). However, this is only one study, and I am no expert on this topic. Also, from what I remember large dinosaurs developed largely from the mid-Jurassic to Cretaceous. Lastly, having seen some of the video, the claim is that Apatosaurus had nostrils the size of a horse. According to Weischampel, Dodson and Osmolska, "Dinosauria", page 273 "In general terms, the most striking features of the sauropod skull include the enlarged and retracted externel nares [DM: nostrils]".
