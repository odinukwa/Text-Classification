Simple summary: among older men (>40 years old), there is no definitive link between 'lesions of endodontic origin', i.e. problems that can be treated by endodontic therapy, and coronary heart disease. However, among younger men, endodntic lesions 'were significantly associated with time to CHD diagnosis'. In other words, among younger men there is a statistically significant change of getting endodontic lesions and needing a root canal after being diagnosed with coronary heart disease. 

Do root canals cause heart attacks?: Getting to the root (pun intended) of the question: there is no definitive evidence that root canals cause heart attacks. This is a review of dozens of studies and books spanning over a century related to this topic. There is far too much to cite here, so I will focus on just the concluding paragraph: 

The document you linked was published in 2013 and outlines the WHO's general strategy and position regarding alternative medicines, though they tend to refer to them as traditional and complementary medicines. Looking at the opening paragraphs on the linked document, you can see their position: 

Yes, though the improvement is not direct, not large, and not just from classical music. Listening to any emotionally positive music has been shown to improve a subject's mood, which in turn has been shown to improve cognitive abilities. Furthermore, although positive effects on certain tasks have been observed, the effects appear to be quite small overall. In short, it's your mood and not the music. If listening to classical music improves your mood, then yes, classical music will have a small positive effect on your performance at various cognitive tasks. If listening to heavy metal improves your mood, then heavy metal will provide the same small performance improvement. 

Survival of three weeks is definitely not possible. The longest time you can survive under ideal conditions without drinking (or being administered) any water is projected at 10 days. Other than that (depending on whether the depth of the coma interferes with your breathing regulation), a few days should be survivable. But I doubt you'd be in a good enough condition to outrun a zombie afterwards. Hard to find references on that, though. 

In this video, Ted Cruz is asked by the newsanchor how he feels about asking for disaster relief funds in the wake of hurricane Harvey when he opposed such a bill for hurricane Sandy. He argues that he is all for disaster relief, but that the hurricane Sandy bill became a 50 billion dollar bill, 2/3 of which were "pork spending" that had nothing to do with Sandy, which is why he opposed that bill. Is it true that the bill contained that much unrelated material? One of the YouTube comments links to an act that reads more like a 10 billion dollar increase in spending for the National Flood Insurance Program. But maybe that's not the relevant bill in this case? 

In 1996, there was a publication by Greaves et al. in the Lancet titled "An air stewardess with puzzling diarrhoea" about a stewardess who presented with a 7-year history of abdominal pain and diarrhoea (up to 10 times a day). The cause they finally found was overuse of sorbitol-containing chewing gum. (Unfortunately the article can't be accessed for free) There are more case reports like this, for example in the British Medical Journal where people consuming sorbitol in amounts of about 20-30 grams a day (one chewing gum stick contains about 1.25 g, apparently) had similar problems. The authors conclude 

Possible alternative- heart disease leads to root canals: The idea that root canal procedures lead to heart attacks is mainly based on inconclusive, anecdotal evidence that people who underwent a root canal is potentially more likely to have a heart attack. Although there is no evidence to support that root canals cause heart attacks, heart disease certainly leads to heart attacks, and through, well regarded, thorough research suggests a link between heart disease and what causes the need for endodontic therapy. The Veterans Administration Longitudinal Study of Oral Health and Disease was a study conducted over 30 years which examined the medical health 708 males who were decently healthy at the beginning of the study. Every three years, participants in the study were given complete medical and dental examination in order to find potential links between oral health and diseases. The relevant data for this question is examined in this study, which determined the following: 

This paper details the chemical composition of rainwater collected in India. They found traces of ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, calcium, magnesium, and several other elements and minerals. This paper details an investigation into elevated lead levels being found in rainwater collection tanks in Australia, and although the lead didn't actually come from atmospheric dust as was at first believed, the fact that the word 'elevated' was used implies some amount of lead in rainwater is expected. Finally, This paper details attempts at purifying rainwater in China, and that they were testing the removal of lead, zinc, and ammonium nitrogen from the rainwater. If they wanted a process to remove those elements from rainwater, then presumably they are common elements in atmospheric water. 

I suggest you read the current WHO report on Alcohol and Health 2011. Look for example at page 26, Figure 12: Alcohol abuse is the main cause of liver cancer (which can develop following liver cirrhosis) in the Western World (in other places it's still Hepatitis B). Other cancers linked to alcohol consumption are esophageal cancer, mouth and oropharynx cancer, and a few others (colon cancer, breast cancer) where it appears to be a risk factor, too. Quoting from the same report (p. 20): 

However, studies appear to contradict this. According to the book "Alkohol und Alkoholfolgekrankheiten" by Singer/Teyssen (in German, sorry), studies during wine degustations (where ethanol is brought in contact with the oral mucosa but not swallowed), there was no relevant rise in blood alcohol levels, unless contact was for more than one hour (and then only to a BAC of 0.015). They conclude that a stronger buzz after drinking ethanol through a straw has never been scientifically observed. 

Today, I was made aware of a research project made by Ugandan CS students who claim to have built a smartphone app together with a device called a "matiscope" that 

in order to detect an infection with Malaria. Now this device sounds a lot like a simple oximeter, and the claims put forth in that article are rather vacuous, i. e. 

Ethanol resorption can occur in the mouth (which is true) Orally absorbed ethanol doesn't pass first through the liver, yielding a higher bioavailability (which is at least to be expected considering the anatomy of the local blood vessels) Drinking with a straw is supposedly slower, allowing the ethanol a longer contact time with the oral mucosa (which at best sounds plausible but hardly evident). 

Most of the deaths in the source did not include ages, however the simple fact that three children under five were confirmed in the source means we can assume more than three actually have died from smallpox. Regardless, the 'under five' requirement is completely arbitrary and only used to make it seem more correct. 

History behind the idea: The idea that a root canal (or any local infection) can cause disease elsewhere in the body started in the early 1900's and was called the focal infection theory. The relevant part of the theory for this question is that endodontic procedures that remove infected tissue from a tooth's root canals could send the bacteria into the bloodstream. This bacteria would eventually reach the heart, and possibly cause problems such as infective endocarditis(warning: gross picture), a type of heart disease. This theory apparently lost popularity pretty quickly as research supporting the focal infection theory remained minimal as knowledge of infections, antibiotics, and contradicting evidence grew: As an example, today tens of thousands of root canal procedures happen daily, and about 5 cases of infective endocarditis happen yearly. However, the lack of definitive supporting research hasn't stopped modern critics of root canals from reviving the focal infection theory as well as other alternative theories, such as holistic dentistry. I won't go into too many details about holistic dentistry, but phrases like "knowledge drawn from the world's great traditions" and "deals with the mind, body, and spirit of the patient and not just their 'teeth'" should be all you need to know about it.
