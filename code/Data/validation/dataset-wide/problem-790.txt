Even your second image isn't correct. Imagine zooming in on a small portion of the Moon's orbit about the Sun, for example, one full moon to the next, with the Sun zoomed out of the picture. Now imagine drawing a line segment from one outer cusp (full moon) to the next. In both of your images, that line segment crosses outside of the curve. In other words, both of your curves are concave. Compare that to the he Moon's orbit about the Sun. This is a convex curve. If you pick any two points on that curve and draw a line segment between them, the entirety of that segment will be on or inside the curve. The reason the Moon's orbit about the Sun is convex is because the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on the Moon is more than twice than exerted by the Earth on the Moon. The orbit would be concave if the Moon was closer to the Earth than 259000 km (about 40.6 Earth radii). Since the Moon orbits at about 385000 km (about 60.4 Earth radii), the Moon's orbit about the Sun is convex. Whether the orbit of a moon about the Sun is non-simple (first image in the question), simple/concave (second image in the question), or simple/convex (Moon's orbit about the Sun), the deviations from an ellipse are tiny. With regard to the Earth-Moon system, the deviations are so very small that at the plotted resolution (288x288 pixels), the orbits of the Earth, the Earth-Moon barycenter, and the Moon about the Sun will be right on top of one another. The reason the variations are so small (less than one pixel at 288x288 pixels) is because of the huge ratio of the size of Earth/Moon orbit about the Sun compared to the size of the Moon's orbit about the Earth. Those backward loops in your first image don't happen for any object orbiting the Earth. That would require an orbital velocity about the Earth greater than the Earth's orbital velocity about the Sun. The Earth's orbital velocity about the Sun is about 30 km/sec, considerably more than the orbital velocity of an object in low Earth orbit is about 7.8 km/sec. 

Since the direction of revolution of all the planets is the same, the direction of angular velocity vector on the planet is taken to be North, and the direction of revolution is said to be east. Just like Earth. 

That's right. You get a sinusoidal curve. The special thing about this curve is that it changes fast at some points and slow at others. Transit is the position when the Sun is highest in the sky. In the curve for equinox (as in Fig 1), if you assign 0° to that point, the Sun is at 90° at sunset and -90° at sunrise. Both positions give you the peak of a sine curve and the change is lowest at that point. That might explain why you get the least difference at Equinox. Now, if you consider the curves for June/December solstice (as in Fig 1), the position for sunset/sunrise is a little off 90°, hence rate of change is faster there as compared to the equinox. That should explain why the disparity is larger at solstices as compared to equinox. But what about the difference in June and Decemeber solstice? Now, my dear, you are entering dangerous territories. Let me remind you that the line/plane along which we are making our degree measurements is perpendicular to horizon. But the plane of circular motion is still at an angle to it. So, the sinusoidal curve has to go through another set of projections before you get the exact thing. On Equator, the disparity between the solstices vanish, yes, as the aforementioned two planes align. Anyway, I was hoping to give you a qualitative description just so you get the gist of it. Here are the equations if you need a mathematical idea $$\cos a = \sin \delta \sin \phi + \cos \delta \cos \phi \cos H$$, $a$ is (90+6)° for civil sunrise/set, and (90+18)° for astronomical sunrise/set, $\delta$ is declination of Sun on that date. Google it. $\phi$ is latitude of the place To get the disparity, you need to find $H$ from the formula for two values of $a$ and get their difference. Remember to divide by 15 to convert from degrees to hours. Here is a graph showing disparity along declination(-23.5° to +23.5°) 

The guide star laser is used to adapt the optics at a specific time and location, for specific atmospheric conditions. It is not, as your question implies, used to calibrate the optics for long-term use. Therefor, if order to calibrate the satellite with a laser fired from Earth, the reconnaissance target would have to provide the laser. This is useless for non-cooperative targets, which I would imagine make up the bulk of the reconnaissance targets. I suppose that one could fire a laser from the satellite itself, but this would have the obvious disadvantage of making it even more obvious when a spy satellite was overhead. In any case, the guide star image does not penetrate the entire atmosphere, I believe that it produces an image just a few tens of kilometers up. This is useful because it is the thicker, denser and more turbulent lower air of which is the most concern to optics. Firing the laser from above would thus see the laser energy absorbed in the thinner, stiller, more predictable upper atmosphere, thus it would have must less advantage. One final reason not to use a guide star laser on a reconnaissance satellite would be power budget. These satellites are as small as possible, with as small a heat and reflectivity index as possible. The added power source, be it RTG, conventional batteries, or solar, would likely increase the reflectivity of the satellite. 

Astronomers distinguish a prototstar from a star based on whether the object is visible. A protostar is hidden by the gas cloud that surrounds it. Protostars aren't visible. At some point in their evolution (and where this occurs depends on mass and metallicity), a protostar will start clearing the surrounding cloud of gas. This process happens very quickly from an astronomical point of view. (Aside: From a human point of view, this is anything but quickly.) In the case of very massive stars, the newly emerged star is already on the main sequence. Very massive stars are "stars" (objects with a stable mass, stable size, and fusing hydrogen into helium) well before astronomers can see them. In contrast, very small stars spend hundreds of millions of years of evolution between being a "star" (visible to astronomers) and being on the main sequence. The star is a pre-main sequence star during this long span of time. Intermediate mass stars also spend some time as a pre-main sequence star. How much time depends on mass and metallicity. In the case of a star with a mass of ~1 solar mass and metallicity comparable to that of the Sun, the time spent as a pre-main sequence star is on the order of tens of millions of years. In contrast, the time spent as a protostar is very short, tens of thousands of years. The time taken to clear the star system of gas (the transition from protostar to PMS star) is shorter yet, hundreds to a few thousand of years. There is no point at which one can say fusion starts. It's a probabilistic thing, with probability increasing sharply with density and temperature. What about objects at the low end of density and temperature? This is the boundary that separates red dwarfs from brown dwarfs. There is very little difference between the smallest red dwarfs and the largest brown dwarfs. The smallest red dwarfs are quite cool. They fuse hydrogen into helium via the p-p chain, but rather infrequently. The largest brown dwarfs also fuse hydrogen into helium via the p-p chain, but here the fusion reactions are so very infrequent that the brown dwarf gets cooler and cooler. In a trillion years, we might be able to point to a marked boundary between old red dwarfs and old brown dwarfs. Right now, that boundary is rather arbitrary. 

The relationship is a squared relationship, therefore if you decide that you are interested in only 1000 meters as your "sky" (maybe you like to photograph birds) then you have about 3 KM^2 of sky available to you. 

For the area of sky as defined by "areas visible above your head inside Earth's atmosphere" then the answer depends on the height of the objects that you would like to observe. I like to observe airplanes, so without loss of generality I'll use ~10,000 meters as my "sky". We can see airplanes up to about 40 KM away. 

The greatest tidal variations (difference between high tide and low tide) occur when the tides induced by the Moon and the Sun are in phase. These are the spring tides, and this happens twice per month, roughly near full moon and new moon (but with some variation place to place). The smallest variations (which is what the question asks) occur when the tides induced by the Moon and Sun are out of phase. These are the neap tides, and this also happens twice per month, roughly when the Moon is half full, or first and third quarter. The Moon's contributions to the tides is about twice that of the Sun (but this also varies from place to place). The Moon's orbit is eccentric, so tidal variation will be even greater when the Moon is full or new and the Moon is closest to the Earth. These are the perigean spring tides. The flip side of this effect, which is what the question asks, would be the neap tides that occur when the Moon is furthest from the Earth. These are the apogean neap tides. See Donald Olson (2012), "Perigean Spring Tides and Apogean Neap Tides in History," American Astronomical Society Meeting Abstracts# 219. I've described three different frequency effects above. There are a huge number of other frequency considerations that affect the magnitudes of the tides. Modern tidal theory is the result of the combined efforts of William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), George Darwin, E.W. Brown, and A.T. Doodson. By Doodson's time, there were 388 different frequency components of the tides in use. My description above captures just three of them. Nowadays, people use over a thousand different frequencies to fully characterize tidal behaviors. All of these effects are small compared to those that result in the spring tides and neap tides. The tidal variations (difference between high tide and low tide) that distinguish the spring tides from the neap tides can be huge, several feet in some places. The tidal variations that distinguish the perigean spring tides from the apogean spring tides are much, much smaller, on the order of inches. The other thousands of effects are smaller yet. 

The smallest natural object that I know of that has been detected from an Earth-bound telescope is 2011 CQ1, a one-meter asteroid observed while specifically looking for NEOs. As DeerHunter mentions in a comment, smaller artificial objects are identified and tracked, mostly by NORAD and some other national defence centers. 

Time dilation is a relative phenomenon, not a local phenomenon. As adrianmcmenamin mentioned, Earth's motion around the sun is cause for no more time dilation than any other point in the universe. Consider that the sun is travelling around the galaxy at 200 km/s, and the Milky Way is approaching Andromeda at 130 km/s. We do not know at what speed we are approaching the great attractor, and I hope that at this point it becomes obvious that there is no difference in "us approaching the great attractor" to "the great attractor approaching us". Nothing is considered "stationary to the background" in an infinite, expanding universe as there is no "background" to measure against. Consider the gedankenexperiment of comparing a clock on Earth to a clock orbiting the galaxy. Now compare those clocks to clocks outside the galaxy. You might consider the clock that ticks the most time away to be the "most at rest clock". Now I ask you, how will you compare the clocks? You must move at a significant portion of the speed of light for a very long time to get information from one clock to the next. Thus, the messenger would suffer the effects of Special Relativity, rendering the comparison meaningless. To further the point, consider the development of International Atomic Time. I'll quote directly from wikipedia: 

I happen to have represented my nation at IOAA Start with "Roy and Clarke's" book : "Astronomy: Principles and Practice" Move on to the references mentioned in the book. 

At all places where I have read of Moving Cluster Method for measuring distance to a cluster and once applied myself on data, I have been told that the method has been successfully applied only to Hyades cluster in Taurus. 

Hence, distance measurements using parallax method have their range based on the angular resolution of the telescope being used. Image source: $URL$ 

Angular momentum is a conserved quantity (more on this later). What this means is that if some object is undergoing a change in angular momentum, that angular momentum must necessarily be transferred to some other object or objects. The Earth is losing rotational angular momentum. It's rotation rate is slowing down. That means some mechanism must exist for transferring that angular momentum. The Earth's angular momentum would change if the Earth was struck by an asteroid, but that would be a very, very small change. The loss of gases from the top of the atmosphere is also represents a negligibly small transfer of angular momentum, as does the interaction of the Earth's magnetic field with the solar wind. The Earth is far too large to be subject to the YORP effect, and The only mechanism left is gravitation. Almost all of the Earth's loss of rotational angular momentum due to a slowing rotation rate is via gravitation. A small amount is transferred to the Sun and to the Earth's orbit about the Sun. All that is left is the Moon. That vast majority of the Earth's lost angular momentum goes into making the Moon recede from the Sun. Angular momentum is a conserved quantity. The conservation laws are very important in higher level physics (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian physics); they are assumed rather than derived. Even higher level physics derives the conservation laws from Noether's theorem. However, angular momentum can also be derived from the strong form of Newton's third law. Proving this is standard fare in every undergraduate and graduate classical mechanics text. For example, it's the subject of chapter 2 in Classical Dynamics Of Particles And Systems by Marion et al. and it's the subject of chapter 1 (starting on page 5) in Classical Mechanics by Goldstein et al. There are some nice online derivations as well, such as the week 1 lecture notes for a class on Central Forces at Oregon State University. Another name for a force that obeys the strong form of Newton's third law is a central force. A central force is one in which the force 

You will not be able to see Saturn's rings directly with a 15x70 telescope, but you will be able to notice that Saturn appears elliptical, not round. This is due to the shape of the rings around the planet, but you will not be able to resolve the hole between the rings and the planet (much less the Cassini gap). Just as an impractical suggestion in the interest of giving to you a more complete answer, you might be able to mount a camera and use image stacking to see a smidge of ring and differentiate it from the sphere of the planet. If you do go this route, please post online about your setup and results, whether it succeeds or not.

The radome protects the telescope against weather, but also hides the antenna from optical light. A couple of other radio telescopes at the Haystack Observatory show yet another problem: 

If the question is asking whether a radio telescope can be used to capture visible light, the answer is no. I'll start with the receiver. It's designed to capture long wavelength radiation. Photons in the visible spectrum will have minimal, if any, impact on a radio telescope receiver. An even bigger problem with some radio telescopes is depicted below.
