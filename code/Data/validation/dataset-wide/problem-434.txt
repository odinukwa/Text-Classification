Zootopia I think it would be just enough for a more or less literal racism if biological differences between the two made it that one of the races was strictly carnivorous and the other strictly herbivorous. The difference could be the effect of a virus changing their digestive systems. Originally, both races were omnivorous, much like humans, but they were different enough so that their organisms responded differently to the same virus. So now it's easy to distinguish between the two even though the difference in their respective visual traits has nothing to do with the main problem. Since their diets are so radically opposite, it's very difficult for both races to live in the same place. And if they have little opportunity to socialize with representatives of another ethnic group, it's very easy to perceive them as a threat. False stories start to spring up. The other culture starts to look extreme and barbaric. And so on. The arguments against carnivores are pretty simple: They feed on carcasses. They require slaughter houses. They (everyone knows that) drink blood. They are treacherous and cunning: after all they raise cattle, acting as if they were friends to the innocent animals, and then they kill them. And what if... what if they eat us, herbivores, too?! There are stories about missing children, you know. It's a bit harder to think something out against herbivores, but this is not impossible. Carnivores are shunned and hated by the herbivore society, so they tend to come up with ideas which show that in fact the carnivores are better. Herbivores are weak. They prefer shady politics instead of a simple, honest conflict. They have no honour. Long time ago everyone we were all carnivores and only they changed and now they lie that we were changed too. When a carnivore mates with a herbivore, the child dies. See? (You can elaborate on that: what if living or dying, or the diet, of the offspring depends on who is the father and who is the mother, or on the sex of the child?) On top of that, herbivores are hypocrites. How do think, why there is no cattle in the herbivore lands? What happened to all the animals? Huh? Huh? 

I don't like much ideas turning around hostile aliens so powerful that the are able to destroy the whole interstellar civilization in a blink of an eye and then disappearing without a trace. One of the possible explanations for such an outcome, and I think a bit more interesting, would be the massive use of biological weapons on both sides. Both humans and aliens infect the other side with plagues which are unstoppable and which wipe them out completely and this is how the war ends. But some remnants of the alien species survive on a distant planet. It takes them several thousands of years to rebuild their civilization and come back for revenge. In the process, the knowledge who were their enemies is lost, so when they find the ruins of the human civilization and another species in their viccinity, they assume these are humans and immediately attack. This scenario gives the player the possibility to win the game not by winning the war, but by convincing the aliens they are mistaken. To make the things morally simpler you can make it so the humans were really the bad guys here and the aliens were only defending themselves in that first war. But that's boring. Let's have something else. Consider mosquitos. They're active in a short interval of a year. In Lappland one day there are no mosquitos in the woods, the next one you're literally not able to walk through without being wrapped in a cloud of repellant. They hatch from eggs, go through a short larvae-pupae period, and then they transform into the adult form. As adults they try to find a source of food to have energy to mate and lay eggs. Then they die and the new generation awaits the next year. No, I don't suggest the aliens to look or suck blood like mosquitos. I'm pointing to this repeating pattern of behaviour. A mindless predator killing their prey as quickly as possible in order to obtain resources for reproduction would be like a plague so deadly that it does not give itself time to spread. A species which want to use this pattern successfully on the interstellar scale has to be subtler and at least a bit intelligent. They may, for example, have their "larvae" period as harmless and quite intelligent beings. Once upon a time human explorers found a desolate planet full of ruins. They also found eggs (or something similar: I wouldn't like it to look too similar to the "Alien" franchise). They scanned them and decided they're pretty harmless so they took them home for further investigation. The eggs hatched and small, cute, intelligent creatures came to life. First they lived in the research centers, but since consecutive tests were showing they're harmless, and they were intelligent enough to be treated as chimps or dolphins, or even little children, it was decided that they should have be treated better than that. After all, maybe they're last survivors of an ancient civilization, who knows? The catch is, the transformation from the larvae into the adult form changes the creature completely, together with their brain functions, so the larvae may be genuinely friendly and harmless. Only when the period comes to end all of them very quickly transform into a much more deadly, carnivorous form. At that moment there were so many of them, and the security concerns so non-existent, that they were able to kill almost everyone in very short time. And having enough resources they were able to multiply quickly, without a period of being dormant. Only after they killed off all humans they turned against themselves: They killed each other for food and to lay eggs and the intervals between laying eggs and hatching became longer and longer. When the next species discovered the ruins of the human civilization, they also found millions of harmless eggs lying around and no living adult creature. And this is how Gremlins came to be :) 

Make it a planet with a constant eclipse. It's not possible in a natural way (at least not one I can think of) which means that the planet is some sort of a terraforming experiment gone terribly wrong. Let's say there is a gigantic solar sail on the day side of the planet, blotting out the sun as Persian arrows in "300". It does not orbit the planet, but does not fall down either, using a part of the harnessed energy in order to stay in place, some thousands of miles above the ground. There is also a big moon, similar to ours, so the night side is lit by it for one half of each month. During the other half the moon is on the day side and the sail blocks it as well. This way the planet can be quite close to its sun and the sail may, for example, let in infrared light (or maybe it simply cools itself down by radiating heat). So even if it's constant night the temperatures on the surface do no necessarily have to be close to absolute zero. Especially if you want snow to occur the planet has to have a working hydrologic cycle. 

Yes, if certain conditions were fulfilled. First of all, I think a subterranean ocean is necessary. Or even better: a whole network of seas and lakes connected by tunnels. It would mean the crust of the planet is very thick and hard on the outside, but beneath there is a porous layer, probably full of soluble materials. The oceans would be very salty in comparison to Earth's oceans but that in fact may help you. You would also need heat. If the planet is too hot on the surface, then it would be enough that the outside part of the crust is in certain places thin enough for the surface heat to warm the water. If not, we can go in the other direction, so deep that the waters are heated by the planet's core. Or by undersea vulcanoes. In fact, it would be nice to have some undersea volcanoes anyway. Even on Earth there are certain ecosystems in places where the Sun doesn't shine and I don't mean it in the metaphorical sense. These microorganisms are called extremophiles, because they fare very well in conditions which are deadly for us, like very high temperatures and extreme salinity. On your planet they would probably be the first organisms to evolve, just next to undersea warm vents, and then they would slowly spread to colder areas, mixing with those evolving in other seas and lakes. But these conditions, good enough for microorganisms, seem to be too harsh for something more complex. For that you would need warm, but not too warm water and much lower salinity. Fortunately, that's possible as well if you give these extremophiles a few hundred million years. That too happened on Earth in a way: Oxygen appeared first in the atmosphere as toxic waste of cyanobacteria feeding on CO2 (Great Oxygenation Event). In your case, a certain species of extremophiles would have to develop ability to turn salts into some kind of neutral material as a byproduct of their metabolic cycle. Gradually the not so hot waters away from undersea volcanoes would become less salty, and because of the abundance of extremophile microbiological life, they would become more rich in nutrients. And in such conditions more complex life could evolve. As for intelligence... I guess with complex organisms the rest is just evolution working through millenia. Recently I have read a book about something like that, a civilization of "crustaceans" living on the seafloor on a planet covered by an ocean frozen on the surface: A Darkling Sea. 

Okay, let's play with this concept a bit. "Cavemen" - apart from it being a very racist term, I mean, dude, if I was a Neanderthal I would be seriously offended; don't do that, pls - basically describes people living in conditions similar to the Paleolithic era. It says nothing about the world around them, as other commentators already pointed out: There are Stone Age cultures on Earth right now. But let's say it is a planet where really there are no advanced civilizations. Still, it doesn't mean that there wasn't one in the past, and it was destroyed. But it's also not really post-apo: There's abundance of greenery, the world is flourishing with life, and there's still a lot of self-replicating, self-maintaining technology, powered by renewable energy sources. Only that it's just lying around doing nothing, because there's no one to operate it anymore. But there are cavemen. Descendants of the people who created that technology. They don't remember their history, they know nothing about science, and they treat these technological artifacts as magic and gods. Fortunately for them Graphical User Interfaces of these artifacts were made to be idiot-proof. A shaman of one of the tribes figured out at some point that if you do certain moves, touch screens in right ways in right times - basically, if you perform a ritual correctly - then the artifact will do something useful. This dark, deep knowledge was then passed through generations and developed upon. So, after hundreds of years, shamans of this tribe are actually able to launch a small space shuttle into the orbit and come back alive. And then, with another hundreds of years maybe, if the GUI is really well designed, they will be able to perform magic spell which will put them in a long, cold, sleep and make them travel to other planets, still without knowing what is really going on. 

If we assume it to be a magical setting where we don't have to follow laws of physics very adequately... Let's build a gigantic windmill, a mile high and with wide arms so it can harness tremendous windpower. Then, let's make equally gigantic springs from special (magical?) kind of iron. They would be mounted on the windmill and wound up. After that they be used as engines in trains and ironclads. A spring should store enough windpower that it would be sufficient for a journey from the windmill to far away places, with passengers and cargo, and then back. After the return the spring would have to be mounted on the windmill and wound up again. 

Religions rarely appear because someone lied. More often they are results of honest try to understand the world connected with some kind of mystic revelation. The mystic revelation might be connected to dreams, hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, but they might be as well realizations of some profound truths which occur to the "prophet" in such a groundbreaking way that he or she decides that it had to come from something supernatural. In the theravadin tradition, Buddha Gautama decided to sit in meditation under a tree until he reaches Enlightenment. When he did it was to him as if his eyes opened again and now he saw the whole world in a different way. Before that moment he was a vedic ascetic (it would be anachronistic to say that he was a Hindu). After, his understanding of the world changed so much that he built his whole system from anew and was even afraid that people would not be able to understand it. If he was right or wrong is a different question, but it seems that he was honest when he taught it. If people had perfect memory it would not prevent the spread of Buddhism. In fact, it is claimed that one of the disciples of Gautama had perfect memory and he was crucial in preserving his teachings after Gautama passed away. Mani was the founder of now extinct religion called Manichaeism (surprise, surprise). He lived in the III century in the second Persian Empire (nowadays Iraq and Iran) and spoke Syriac. He connected beliefs from a wide range of gnostic sects which made something of a continuum between Christianity and Zoroastrianism, added a bit of early Buddhism to it and wrote a book full of cosmic beings and complex theology. He claimed to be inspired by his "heavenly twin", a being which appeared to him. It sounds much more like a lie than what Buddha did, but liars usually has a purpose in their lying. I didn't look like Mani had a purpose. He made a bold move and presented the book to his king, Shapur I, who was not impressed but nevertheless allowed Mani to preach his religion. But the king's son, Bahram, was not so tolerant and Mani died in his prison in a very gore way some years later. I would say Mani was guy who made something up but then started to believe it himself. If by "perfect memory" you mean that he would not fall into delusion then there would probably was no Manichaeism (which is extinct anyway and its greatest legacy is how it influenced Red Turbans rebellion in medieval China, as well as some small gnostic sects in Middle East). But maybe Mani would have been remembered as the first author of epic fantasy ;) On the other hand there are guys like Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of Bahai Faith or Guru Nanak, who founded Sikhism. We can't know for sure how true are stories about their revelations and how much they just made up, but it seems that they both worked for common good, and not just their own profit. Especially Bahá'u'lláh was a very peaceful person, a poet, who believed that we can all accept our differences and live in peace (after all, all prophets preached the same religion, didn't they? ;) ). In effect, he spent a large part of his life in prison, because Islamic authorities didn't really agree with him. Guru Nanak was (I think) more successful. He lived in the XV-XVI century in what is now Pakistan and he claimed to have a revelation from God which connected Islam and Hinduism. Pretty convenient for someone living in the territory where these both cultures mixed and clashed all the time, no? ;) I always wonder why God didn't reveal herself to some indigenous peoples in, let's say, Borneo and gave them the same message as to Arabs, for example. That would solve a lot of problems about which religion is true. But anyway, even if Nanak made that up, his teachings were an attempt to improve relations between Muslims and Hindus. For sure he didn't make up stories about the past, so perfect memory wouldn't change anything. I know I'm not answering your question directly - my point is, in my opinion perfect memory would not change much in people's beliefs, because beliefs are rarely based on lies which could be exposed.
