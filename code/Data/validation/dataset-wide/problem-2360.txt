There are relatively well known steps to dealing with this out in the wilds. One online resource with pictures is at Backpacker Magazine. The basic steps (that are detailed there) are: 

One of my tents has fluorescent paracord - it doesn't glow in the dark, but is incredibly bright and can easily be seen. We also attach some of it as guidelines when pitched in wilder areas to help the kids find their way to the tents in the dark. It works well - typically the only people who trip over them are adults...if they have had one two many glasses of wine... Glow in the dark sounds like a good idea though - if it is at a reasonable price I would suggest getting it anyway and trying it. 

Typically, if you are out in the open ocean and do not have a GPS device you don't have any useful way to measure velocity* This may not be a problem though, as what you are wanting is not your velocity, but an indication that you are heading in a straight line to the destination (if we assume a constant current) To do this, what you need is something to allow you to measure parallax - in this case the obvious would be a front leg and a back leg of the oil rig. When you first start swimming, check frequently to see if you are moving left or right with respect to your target. Correct your angle by 10 degrees in the opposite direction to your perceived drift (left or right) and keep swimming. You want to reduce the side drift to zero - as this will indicate you are moving directly towards your target. Where you have varying current, for example between two islands, you would use a different tactic as the current would be strongest mid-channel so you would have to point higher in the middle. *If you are out for many days and have an accurate chronometer, you can get a reasonable idea as to your longitude, but that seems out of scope for this question 

If you normally have a coffee in the morning then you will be fine with a coffee in the morning out on the trail. It is part of your daily routine. It is useful to have something like red bull or energy drinks in a pack as part of your emergency rations as week. Not for long term but if you need to stretch a few final miles late in the day due to delays it can help. 

Are really not an issue in climbing. Crashes in cycling often cause road rash, where dirt, grit, and hair are forced into a surface wound. This is not your typical climbing injury. The third one, 

No one uses them as absolute evidence, as you could always fake them, but they can really help a tour guide get a feel for your level of experience and to understand which situations you felt comfortable with and which caused you problems. They also help you remember how a particular tour went, as afterwards you may not remember in detail. 

from Wikipedia In saying that, if you must use a bowline, having the end inside is more secure than outside as there is less chance of the free end catching on something and releasing. (interestingly, according to Wikipedia, the bowline knot is thought to have been first mentioned in John Smith's 1627 work A Seaman's Grammar) 

I'd probably go with a foam roll mat under you, as your biggest heat loss well be conduction through the metal bed. As the space isn't that great, the cap shouldn't need insulation, but this will depend on your sleeping bag. 

The magnetic declination at the south pole works the same way to that at the north, and for exactly the same reason. The magnetic field, while generated by the spin of the Earth's core is not tied to the physical spin axis for the earth so the exact magnetic north and south move. Before you travel near the poles (you don't even need to be that near for declination to be significant) you should look at a declination map, or the online NOAA page for declination. At really high latitudes (either north or south) it is essential to have an accurate declination map with you or you could get very lost. 

The simple solution is not to rub your arms against your torso. If you can't do this, you can buy things like rash vests, that a lot of surfers and kayakers use, or even house fat or Vaseline like cross channel swimmers use. 

To be honest, the two terms, "Ultralight" and "Cottage Industry" are orthogonal - there are cottage industries producing many items. You are probably seeing more Ultralight items in this space because cottage industries are more likely to succeed where big business doesn't have the volume to play properly. So this usually means "normal" kit that is suitable for the majority of potential customers. Ultralight items have a very small market so can be profitable for cottage industries, while being less profitable for big business. 

My wife has Reynaud's which leads to poor circulation in fingers and toes, so needs to use these solutions on occasion, and they are very effective. 

The author has extensive experience in this area and his page is well worth a read as he goes into detail above and below decks. 

This is all information you can get from a plethora of online sources, but from a quick 2 minutes I found this: 

There are any number of ways to do this, but perhaps the simplest is to use something similar to this belt mounting clip and have one of your rucksack straps fed through the belt loops: 

Scurvy Grass Sorrell has leaves rich in Vitamin C, and got its name from sailors travelling round Cape Horn who would eat the leaves to avoid scurvy. It tastes pretty good, despite what the Wikipedia page says, but I'm not sure how widespread it is outside South America. 

You can easily* make two strand cord out of a variety of materials - I have done it with long grasses, but any relatively long fibrous material can work, including the fibres from inside woody stemmed plants, strips torn from a t-shirt, even plastic bags. Where you have flattish grasses, you can roll them between the palms to flatten them slightly and split the fibres apart a little - not completely, but enough to help them bind together. Using relatively dry fibres, for example, from recently dead wood will allow you to bind the cord together more tightly than wet fibres, and in fact wet bound cord may separate as it dries, so do try to choose dry fibres where possible. Avoid lining up the ends of fibres, as when you twist them together that would make a single point of weakness, so stagger the ends. Then take two strands and twist them together - the key here is that if you are winding the fibres together clockwise as viewed from the end, you must twist each fibre in an anticlockwise direction. Keeping the wrap tight is essential, especially when you bring in a new fibre - which you should overlap with the one which is ending. (will try and pop in some diagrams when I get a chance, in case this isn't clear) *easily - this can take hours and leave your hands aching, but anybody should be able to make two strand cord.*
