To think critically, one has to be careful not to jump to a conclusion about something merely based on the sequence and timing of such events. Such is the case with the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. The speaker has said that because there were few problems (event Y) that followed Y2K (event X), therefore Y2K must not have caused problems. An identical version of the post hoc ergo propter hoc would have been like: 

The speaker has jumped to a conclusion and made a hasty generalization--which in this case is the inverse! (because blank Y did not follow blank X then blank X must not have caused blank Y) The speaker has also ignored that there were many people working around the clock to make sure such bugs would be fixed if presented; this may the real reason why few problems presented after Y2K, not that Y2K itself had no effect. 

I think the fallacy you are looking for is the Perfect Solution Fallacy, where the arguer dismisses a proposed solution because it is not "perfect." In your example, the arguer has dismissed the idea of gun control because "there are already too many guns--it is useless to try to control them." 

The line of thought mentioned above is most likely an inverse (if a then b --> if not a then not b) version of the Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc fallacy. The fallacy is of the form: 

TL;DR The phrase "innocent, until proven guilty," is a false dichotomy, as the court never tries to prove a person's innocence, only that the defendant is "not guilty." The defendant is taken to be "not guilty" until proven otherwise, and the court makes no declaration of the person's actual innocence. 

Full Thought: Another slant to take on this phrase "innocent until proven guilty" is that it is colloquial in style. A more accurate rendering would be "not guilty until proven guilty" (but this isn't as catchy). A court (and in a greater fashion any falsifiable proposition) may not be able to proven innocent (or false), only that the person is "not guilty." (For instance, proof of an invisible teapot orbiting the sun cannot be proven false - Russell's Teapot). On the flip side, a common methodology employed by jurors is the idea of "beyond reasonable doubt" regarding a person's guilt. Any shadow of doubt means the juror should acquit the defendant as "not guilty," which is not to say that the person is indeed "innocent," if you catch my drift. Courts only address the concept of guilt and never make a proclamation of innocence. This is also why the prosecution must do all the proving--they have to prove the guilt. The defendant has no such duty to prove innocence. In light of philosophy, I'm in agreement with another answer that the concept of the null hypothesis seems a better study. The legal precedent of innocence and guilt rarely finds its way into science or philosophy (IMO). 

This "everything" refers to what? what is everything? Physics is everything? The mathematical model that shapes physics describes everything? Are colours "things" that are reduced to mathematical formulation? (all the qualities vs quantities). For example, in a Aristotelian perspective this is clearly a misnomer. To be more precise, if in some time in future the string theory or another theory came in to being describing the four known forces this would just mean that we have a theory that describes that four forces. Are the four forces the only existent? Is the possible mathematical model a perfect description of all reality? The collapse of the wave function in quantum theory is not something that is understood in the theory, you need to go outside the theory to explain, based in some metaphysical foundation. 

We need first to be clear about the terms that are in use. To be "permanent" implicit make the assumption of some time notion or some movement notion. There is two possible notions of eternety that could be applied: (i) The extension of something in time such that this extension is not finite (Could be foward, backward or both). (ii) The idea of something outside time (and space normally). To be time-permanent is to satisfy (i) or (ii), depends of the ontological notion that you are in. The problem here is to define exactly what is "a thing". For some schools the primordial matter like the greek notion of hylé or the Hindu notion are not "things" because they lack some ontological aspect (like form in Aristotle terms) that put then in other plane of existence. if you are talking about something that have form and are in space time (that is the commum sense when we think in a "thing" or physical object) then i would suggest that the answer is no, there is no such thing that is permanent, because this thing have to satisfy the condition (i) and all that we have experienced are contingent, could easely not exist and i have no reason to think that something like that would have some eternal duration. This notions of primordial matter that was mention, are what could be called aeviternal, something in the "middle" of eternety in the notion (ii) and this world, that is composed of finite duration things. For some thinkers this world is just a fenomenological manifestation of this "matter" in the space-time, and this manifestation is ever of impermanent things because of they nature as objects in the space-time box. Now, some observations: (1) The mathematical objects are in some traditions "things" and for others not. Is a triangle a thing, or just a form or just a word? In a Aristotelian perspective a triangle is not exactly a "thing" but an instance of the universal triangularity, a form that could exist in the things(not by its own). The same discution could be made about moral aspects. (2) For Aquinas God is the only that is eternal in the (ii) sense. The angels and prime matter are aeviternal because they existence depends of the existence of God, they have secondary existence in this ontological "order", so they are not "eternal in themselves". Are they permanent? just in secondary terms too. God could anihilate all the angels, for exemple. So, the permance of all angels depends of God's will. 

Can anyone one provide counterexamples to the following: The assumption that all human behavioral level activity (i.e. no sub-personal or subconscious processes) can be bifurcated into two kinds of routines (activities, tasks, processes)- those that are representational and those that are non-representational; and that all activity is a combination or ratio of the two. By “non-representational routines” I mean causally efficacious or mechanically productive environmental interactivity. Examples are: making a cup of coffee, cooking an egg, walking your dog, riding your bike, driving your car, throwing a ball, taking a bath, mowing the lawn, building a house, etc. By “representational routine” I mean activity that consists in (linguistically mediated) thought and its communication (production) and or interpretation (consumption). Examples are: armchair rumination, inner mumblings, judging, thinking, believing, realizing, remembering, prediction, expecting, deeming, suspecting, surmising, assuming, conjecturing, planning, goal setting, reasoning, calculating, inferring, imagining, fantasizing, understanding, comprehending, (philosophizing!) etc. Inscription/enunciation: writing, texting, scrawling, sketching, illustrating, blogging, speaking/talking, discussing, debating, lecturing, miming, acting, etc. Reading/interpreting: speech, text, icons, symbols, signs, maps, (technical) drawings, diagrams, graphs, tables, etc. 

Consider the following: S1: The assumption that “the chair has certain affordances (weathered, rickety, sturdy, available, etc.)” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity (sitting, avoiding sitting, using as an improvised ladder/a shelf, hanging my coat, burning for heat, etc.) that couples an agent x to the (chair). S2: The assumption that “the patient has advanced artery disease” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity (the administration of statin, nitro-glycerine, ACE inhibitors, advice about radical dietary changes, etc.) that couples the surgeon x to the (patient’s heart/cardiovascular system). S3: The assumption that “consciousness has the property P (physicality, non-physicality, non- localness, universally distributed, etc.)” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity that couples an agent x to the (phenomena of consciousness). There’s obviously nothing controversial about S1 and S2. But, the glaring issue about S3 is precisely what ‘activity’ or ‘operation’ are we talking about here? What is it that you couldn’t actually do (and not just talk about doing) if you weren’t working with the assumption that “consciousness has whatever property P”? 

Looking for specific term to describe those ideas which are commonly held without proper justification or questioning? What about "putative"? 

If we apply Russell’s theory of (definite) descriptions (“On Denoting” 1905) to the sentence “God is subject to logic”, it can be analysed into a conjunction of the following three: 

One can use the information contained in a map to assist in navigational activities within the territory the map is assumed to be a reliable representation of. One can use assembly instructions for the guidance required to piece together flat packed furniture. One makes a shopping list to alleviate the need to remember and to optimise expenditure. One uses signage to help find the location of the toilets in an unfamiliar shopping precinct. One uses the step-by-step procedure in the auto workshop manual to facilitate a coolant/oil/filter change on the car. One uses a recipe to cook an unfamiliar meal- the list is endless. Generally speaking, If a representation R contains genuine and useful information about some target system E, then R can be used to ‘leverage’ (inform/guide/coordinate/instruct/organise/regulate/navigate/anticipate/prepare/etc.) one’s interactions with E (R is used to guide or correct for minor ‘cognitive deficits’ pertaining to E-interactions). If R doesn’t provide this, then R is redundant or worst impedimental. Metaphysics has no utility in this sense and I challenge anyone on this site to provide an obvious counter example that doesn’t trot out some clap trap about ‘understanding’. Pace Logical Positivism, I think the significance of what you might call “the social utility of representation” is however, hopelessly over looked. Metaphysics seems to consist in little more than a pretence to ‘reality tracking’ when the only thing that’s really going on is ‘social coordination’ among only those privileged and versed enough to occupy the upper/inner echelons (much like the Catholic church for example). Think of the notion of ‘latent vs. manifest’ function from sociology. The manifest function here would be to get a grip on what reality is and does and to have that adequately communicated amongst ones interlocutors. The latent function is to reap the residual (perlocutionary, J.L. Austin) social benefits- to get along with this philosopher (camp), make each other feel good, solidarity, trust, inclusion, etc.; or the opposite -to antagonise, show defiance, annoy, exclusion, etc., tenure, grants, publishing notoriety and so on. This ‘social’ phenomenon is rather ubiquitous. We’re all guilty of using a pretence to (or assumption of) reality tracking as a way (mode) of subserving social interaction on a quotidian basis: conversations involving putative topics, news, anecdotes, fables, hot and cold gossip, rumour/hearsay, jokes/comedy, conspiracy, propaganda, errant or extreme values, myths, superstition, religion, mysticism, spirituality, misconception, bigotry, ignorance, white lies, sub cultural norms…, much of what counts as philosophy, etc. It’s a group based (pragmatic) strategy that gets you access to all the latent goodies that come with being socially hooked up with people who are supposedly ‘on the same page’ and separated from those that aren’t. “…, a merely random groping, and, what is worst of all, a groping among mere concepts.”- Immanuel Kant, (Critique of Pure reason).
