Another example is the NRA IX Corps. This unit garrisoned Suiyuan at the height of the Chinese Civil War, and was surrendered when the regional commander, General Fu Tso-i, decided to turn traitor in the hopes of bargaining for some retention of power. The IX Corps was reorganised into the PLA 36th and 37th Armies. They were dispatched to Korea at Fu's instigation in 1951. The pervasiveness of NRA soldiers in the Communist armies becomes treuly apparent when we look beyond the army formation. When they arrived in Korea in 1950, the 38th, 39th, 40th, 42nd, and 66th Armies had all recently integrated one or more formerly Nationalist divisions. In other words, in the first wave of Chinese intervention, every army sent into Korea had at least divisional strength in former NRA soldiers.. 

With Social Security seemingly bogged down, Roosevelt decided to hold off on public health insurance, and ultimately shelved the idea altogether in favour of increasing the availability of medical care. 

The "persisted for at least a few generations" and "conscious educated decision" requirements really nailed the coffin in this case. Especially that latter. It is not altogether uncommon to find organised states collapse; while the result might meet some definitions of anarchy, none of them really made a "conscious educated decision" to practice anarchism. The most promising, closest thing I can think of is Makhnovia, but that only lasted three years. It did however seem to be a conscious choice to create something akin to anarchy. If the requirement for "conscious educated decision" is removed, then I think a good example is the Kowloon Walled City. It was technically retained by China after the rest of the peninsula was leased to Britain; subsequently the authority of neither was in force in the region. So there was no formal rules or government in that region for decades. By even less exacting standards, Medieval Iceland is often cited as an successful example of anarchy. That would seem to be a farcry from what you're asking for though: while decentralised, they had chieftains, laws, a judiciary and a legislature. There's also examples where a state or empire collapses and local governance reverted back to tribes. However, generally speaking, even in tribes the people obeyed chieftains, elders or shamans. The primary difference between that and organised states is that their powers were not generally formalised, but rather depends upon their personal prestige. Disobedience was unpunished in the same sense that the state might drop charges against an accused for various reasons. I'm excluding all the various intentional communities in this answer, because they typically remain subject to the laws and governing powers of the state they reside in. To my mind, they might have removed the hierarchy at the local level, but nevertheless remained part of the national hierarchy with the central government at the top. And also, because they tend to appear to me as a form of the ancient Greek/Roman direct democracy than truly a government-free society of implicit agreements. If you think those qualify though, there are longer lasting examples such as the Stapleton Colony, the Twin Oaks Community, the Danish Christiana, or the Acorn Community Farm. 

Initially, Japanese observers thought the Taiping Rebellion was a nationalist revolt by Ming China loyalists. This perception was encouraged by for instance the rebel slogan "Destroy Manchuria, Revive Han China ". Thus, Japan believed the rebellion to be an attempt by the subjugated Han Chinese natives to free themselves form their Manchurian overlords.

The reality is that Hatutu has very little going for it in terms of human settlement: it a tiny island with no dependable source of fresh water. 

Germany thus portrayed herself as a victim of Russian aggression, and her subsequent military actions "self-defence". 

The use of French has long since died out in English governance. In later times, it appears the monarch simply pronounce: 

In fact, most of the the electronics that would have been affected by low altitude nuclear EMPs would have been destroyed by the explosion itself. Thus, you don't hear much about EMP at Hiroshima and Nagasaki because it was largely inconsequential compared to the heat and blast. 

The eastern states regarded him as a usurper, an illegitimate king who came to power through murder. King You's (factual or otherwise) failings did not excuse this treason. The basis of Zhou governance had been a strict adherence to hierarchical rules, but in a single stroke the new King had broken two of its most sacred laws. Henceforth King Ping, and the line of Eastern Zhou kings he sired, could command scarcely more than vestigial respect. Internal Zhou Division As mentioned earlier, King You disinherited his son before he was killed. This meant that King Ping was not the legal heir when he was being crowned by his grandfather. The kingdom had already become divided between father and son, and the destruction caused by King Ping's regicidal rebels and the barbarians he (or his grandfather) invited failed to win him popular support. Instead, Zhou was plunged into a succession crisis as the nobles crowned the late king's brother2 as King Xie. 

Red was similarly associated with Saint Denis. The flag of his abbey was a banner made of red silk, known as the oriflamme. During the High Middle Ages, this red flag superseded St. Martin's blue cope as the standard of the French Kings. Sources differ on what the banner looked like exactly (e.g., plain vs adorned), but it is agreed to be (more or less) a red banner. 

Wikipedia's "close relationship at the end of the 4th century" is probably talking about Yamato Japan's alliance with Baekje. That began in A.D. 397, and precipitated in a war with Goguryeo. This is recorded in several ancient historical records of both sides. Additionally, it is attested to in the contemporary Gwanggaeto Stele, which commemorates King Gwanggaeto the Great who reigned in Goguryeo during the conflict. The exact details is somewhat subject to debates, often with nationalistic overtones (one North Korean scholar apparently claims that Gwanggaeto conquered Korean colonies in Japan). But generally speaking, it is usually thought that Goguryeo had subjugated Silla and subdued Baekje. The latter then forged an alliance with Japan to attack Silla and Goguryeo, but the coalition was defeated by Gwanggaeto's forces on both attempts. According to the History of the Three Kingdoms, between A.D. 397 and 405, Baekje's Crown Prince Jeonji was hostage in Japan. Envoys were recorded to have been sent between the two courts in 402, 403, 418 and 428, but became more sporadic afterwards in the records. 

The fact is, by 1945, Japan was on its last legs. Its cities were reduced to ashes, its economy ruined, and basic necessities for both war and civilian livelihood were almost depleted. 

Similarly, the great Thomas Paine made no uncertain references to the revolt as a "revolution". In 1778 he famously praised the American Revolution to be the most "virtuous and illustrious" ever. 

The Kidnapper As @TomAu noted, this is a poor translation. The original Chinese phrase Chiang used, , actually has multiple meanings. There are two relevant definitions, neither of which is really captured by "kidnapper". 

Immediately after the Armistice ended the Pacific War, some tens of thousands of Japanese veterans remained in Vietnam, with more in nearby regions. They were actively courted by the Viet Minh, who needed their experience and expertise in their looming war with France. Some 1000 Japanese military personnel thus found themselves on the Vietnamese side, including something like 47 former Kempetai members and/or 46 officers. Though exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. Most of the officers who stayed served as military instructors for the Viet Minh forces, most notably at the Quảng Ngãi Military Academy. They imparted modern military science and training on their students. There were necessary conventional military knowledge such as how to conduct assaults, night attacks, company/battalion level exercises, commanding, tactics, navigation, communications and movements. In addition, they taught them how to fight against a superior enemy through sabotage, ambushes and raids. A few, however, actively led Vietnamese forces into combat. Those who belonged to the Kempetai were apparently all wanted by the allies. Apart from them, I'm not sure which of the Japanese soldiers were, or were accused of being, war criminals. It seems France primarily wanted to deprive the Vietnamese of Japanese military training and assistance. At any rate, beginning in 1951 these soldiers began to be repatriated, and as far as I can tell none ran into trouble when they returned home. Sources: 

Florence, Milan, Venice, and Genoa were the most important city-states of Renaissance Italy. This distinction is the chief attribute shared by these four cities. Of course, that's a bit of an intrinsically subjective statement. There were several major players, and it is difficult to quantify something as nebulous as "importance". Nontheless this particular grouping is quite common. These four cities are pretty much universally regarded as occupying the heart of the north Italic city-state system. For example: 

There are many theories on why the Viking expansion occurred and there is no real consensus on which (or which combination) is the correct one. This particular explaination, that Pagan Scandinavia attacked Christian Europe in an ideological response to the Carolingian expansion, is merely yet another theory on this highly contentious topic. Although it seems to have captured the public's imagination (judging by Wikipedia's article), this explanation does not seem particularly convincing. Specifically for this question, the reaction theory has a major logical inconsistency regarding the attacks on Britain. Namely, Britain was not part of the Carolingian Empire. If the Viking expansion truly was in retaliation for Charlemagne's aggression, why was Britain attacked first? While it might be true that some Vikings were ideologically against Christianity, there is little reason to believe they attacked Britain to get back at the Franks on the continent. More generally, scholars finds the reaction theory rather problematic in general given what is known about Scandinavian societies at the time. 

We have no reason to disbelieve that the Persian king was guarded by a unit of companions. Macedon had the Companion Cavalry, for instance. It also stands to reason that they were an elite force. However, maintaining a unit at constant strength is hardly a frightening feat in and of itself. Persian propaganda could have hyped it up as "immortality"; but if that were the case, we'd expect it to be reflected in the unit's name, or nicknames. That the only source to call the unit Immortals may well have been an error, suggests they didn't. By extension, therefore, the Greeks wouldn't have known to fear its "technically immortal" status. 

Medieval shoes in general were typically made of leather, and for the simplest designs it was little more than a piece of leather strapped on to the ankle with drawstrings or some similar mechanism. 

There is little reason to believe in the historicity of Abraham. He could be a real person, a character composite of many different people, a symbolic representation, or just entirely fictional. And accordingly, there wouldn't be any proof as such that anyone is descended from him. Even if archaeologists were to miraculously stumble upon his remains, it is doubtful whether we could ascertain his identity. The earliest attested inhabitants of Yemen were several Ṣayhadic tribes: Sabaeans, Hadhramis, Qatabans, and Minaeans. These Old Southern Arabic peoples formed from South Semites who may have reached Yemen some time around 2000 B.C., and probably came from somewhere around the Fertile Crescent. Here the Akkadian Empire (in Mesopotamia) and the Amorite Kingdom (in Syria) emerged around 2500-3500 B.C. as the earliest Semitic polities. And the Semitic peoples in general seemed to have originated somewhere in the Near East. Also, the precursors to the first Semites probably reached the Levant from the Afro-Asiatic homeland around the Nile, in Africa. 

These are from Charavines in France, but English animals would have been similar in size. Based on remains, cattle at York were estimated to be between 220 - 270 kg, for instance.1 Of course, the weight of animals did not stay constant throughout the whole of the Middle Ages. They were even smaller during the earliest centuries,2 and seemed to have gradually became larger close to the Early Modern period.3 In any case, height differences are much less dramatic than weight. Medieval cattle were half the weight of industrial revolution ones, but only 20% shorter.4 Hence, compared to ~150cm for cattle and ~75cm for sheep, depending on the species, today: 

It should also be noted that the sengokubune were relatively small vessels operated by only 15 people each. 

Here we see the Trotskyists demonised as Japanese collaborators, designed to evoke hatred for the group at a time of the Sino-Japanese War. When the People's Republic was founded in 1949, the general hostility has not changed. An anthology of Chairman Mao's Greatest Hits published in 1951, shortly after founding, Trotsky's footnotes read: 

Participation in "fighting" was thus declared a capital offence within Imagawa domains (though the code spared the perpetrators' families and made provisions to exempt minors). Similarly harsh laws became popular in the turbulent Sengoku period, with several other examples including the 1556 Yūki and 1597 Chōsokabe house codes. All of these examples predate the founding of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

Thus while still rather exclusive, the royal gifts were by no means restricted to only the top student. Theoretically speaking, it is potentially possible that Jiang Baili received a gift for being one of the best (but not the best) students. However, that still does not square with the fact that the Army Academy gave out silver pocket watches, not swords as the story claims. 

I would say all those possibilities you listed are correct. Trade could be paid in paper money, which could then be redeemed for metal and shipped home. But even in the early 1800s, trade could be conducted on credit. Of course, under normal trading conditions, credit earned from exports was credit that could then be used to pay for imports of other goods (and services[1]). (This answer mostly concerns the Anglo-American trade, since the United Kingdom accounted for something like half[2] of the United States' exports during the antebellum years.) 

However, they were severely countered by Allied forces. The reality is that Allied technological advances had progressively rendered U-boats impotent since the Battle of the Atlantic was won in 1943. By the time of the Normandy Invasion, the U-boat threat was effectively nullified. The U-boats were not responsible for almost any of the (honestly, not that heavy) Allied losses. Nonetheless, the U-boats kept up their attacks in the days after D-Day, ultimately achieving very modest successes. Several ships were sunk, such as HMS Blackwood, the Columbine, SS Maid of Orleans, and others. Several more were also damaged.
