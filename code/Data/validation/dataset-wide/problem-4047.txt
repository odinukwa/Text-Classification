Higman's Criterion is a fundamental result in the representation theory of a finite group $G$ over a field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$. One version is the following (I hope the notation is standard enough): Let $M$ be a $kG$-module and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,{\rm Res}_H^G\, M$ if and only if there is a $kH$-endomorphism $\psi$ of $M$ such that ${\rm tr}_H^G(\psi)=1_M$. Question: suppose that $M$ has a $kH$-endomorphism $\psi$ such that ${\rm tr}_H^G(\psi)=1_M$. Does $\psi M$ contain a $kH$-submodule $L$ such that $L$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ and $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,L$? Motivation: Notice that if $L$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ and if $N$ is a submodule of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ containing $L$, then $L$ is a direct summand of $N$. As a consequence, if $N$ is a submodule of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ which contains $\psi M$, then $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,N$. The standard argument proving the `if' implication in Higman's Criterion appears to show this consequence directly. This seems to me to be a mysterious property of $\psi M$, at least if my Question has a negative answer. Going back to generalities, let $M$ be a $kG$-module and suppose that $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,N$, where $N$ is a $kH$-module. One version of Higman's Theorem produces a $kH$-endomorphism $\phi$ of $M$ such that $t_H^G(\phi)=1_M$. This $\phi$ `factors through' $N$ in the sense that it is a composition $\phi=\phi_2\circ\phi_1$ where $\phi_1:{\rm Res}_H^G\,M\rightarrow N$ and $\phi_2:N\rightarrow{\rm Res}_H^G\,M$. Set $L=\phi M$. Then $L$ is both a submodule and quotient module of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ and a subquotient ${\rm Im}(\phi_1)/{\rm Im}(\phi_1)\cap{\rm ker}(\phi_2)$ of $N$ and $M\mid{\rm Ind}_H^G\,L$. 

Assume given an algebraic stack() $\mathcal{X}$ with presentation $X_0 \to \mathcal{X}$, and the corresponding groupoid $X = (X_0\times_\mathcal{X} X_0 \rightrightarrows X_0)$ in algebraic spaces (or schemes, given the right sort of algebraic stack()). (*)Allow me to be a little loose with the definition. Take your favourite sort of alg. stack if you like. 

A space $X$ is called locally contractible it it has a basis of neighbourhoods which are themselves contractible spaces. CW complexes and manifolds are locally contractible. On the other hand, the path fibration $PX \to X$ space of based paths with evaluation at the endpoint as projection) admits local sections iff $X$ is $\infty$-well-connected (or locally relatively contractible, or semi-locally contractible), that is, has a basis of neighbourhoods $N$ such that the inclusion maps $N\hookrightarrow X$ are null homotopic. Another use of this concept is by Dold, when he proves a Dold fibration (a map with the Weak Covering Homotopy Property) over an $\infty$-well-connected space is locally homotopy trivial. What, then, is an example of a space which is $\infty$-well-connected but not locally contractible? 

Strassen's factoring algorithm shows that $\text{FACTORING} \in \text{DTIME}(N^{\frac{1}{4}+o(1)})$, but if I'm not mistaken in my analysis it also uses a similar amount of space. By making a trade-off I think it is possible to show $\text{FACTORING} \in \text{DTISP}(N^{k+o(1)}, N^{\frac{1}{2}-k+o(1)})$ for $\frac{1}{4} \leq k \leq \frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, trial division up to $\sqrt{N}$ demonstrates $\text{FACTORING} \in \text{DTISP}(N^{\frac{1}{2}+o(1)}, \log(N)^{O(1)})$. The only extra space we need is to keep a counter and perform the divisibility test. Is there any deterministic factoring algorithm known to be in $\text{DTISP}(N^{k + o(1)}, N^{o(1)})$ for $k \lt \frac{1}{2}$? I know that there is an $N^{\frac{1}{3}+o(1)}$-time algorithm due to Michael Rubinstein but I can't tell what the space usage would be. This would qualify as an example if the space can be made subexponential. Otherwise, is trial division the best we can do in $N^{o(1)}$ space? We won't be able to prove $\text{FACTORING} \notin \text{DTISP}(\log(N)^{O(1)}, O(\log(N))) = \text{L}$, since that would imply $\text{NP} \neq \text{L}$, an open problem. 

This has the rather easy answer: No! Let $G$ be a finite group of order divisible by $p$ that has a $p$-block $B$ of defect $0$ and let $M$ be the unique simple $kG$-module in $B$. Take $H$ to be any nontrivial $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $k_H$ is a submodule of Res$_H^G(M)$, as $k_H$ is the unique simple $kH$-module. So $M$ is a submodule of Ind$_H^G(k_H)$, by Frobenius reciprocity. But $M$ is a projective $kG$-module. So $M$ is a direct summand of Ind$_H^G(k_H)$. Now by the last paragraph in my posted question there is a $kH$-homomorphism $\phi$ of $M$ such that t$_H^G(\phi)=1_M$ and $\phi$ factors through $k_H$. So $\phi M\cong k_H$. But Res$_H^G(M)$ is a projective $kH$-module and $k_H$ is a non-projective $kH$-module (as $p$ divides $|H|$). So $\phi M$ has no submodule that is a direct summand of Res$_H^G(M)$. 

It seems to me that all answers to this question will involve the symmetric group. Here is one example from the representation theory of $S_n$ over a field of characteristic $2$: $$ \prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^i)^{-1}=\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^{2i})^{-2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{n(n+1)/2}. $$ The left hand side is the generating function for partitions - the coefficient of $x^n$ is the number of partitions of $n$. The right hand side reflects the way the partitions of $n$ split into $2$-blocks of partitions, according to their $2$-cores. The $2$-cores have the form $[n,n-1,\dots,2,1]$ giving the sum on the extreme right. The other infinite product refers to pairs of partitions, and arises from the enumeration of partitions in a block using a $2$-abacus. Now this equality rearranges and simplifies to $$ \prod_{i=1}^\infty\frac{(1-x^{2i})}{(1-x^{2i-1})}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty x^{n(n+1)/2}. $$ The left hand side ranges over all partitions with all even parts distinct; a partition with $e$ distinct even parts contributes $(-1)^e$ to the sum. So for $n$ not a triangular number, the number of partitions with an odd number of distinct even parts must equal the number of partitions with an even number of distinct even parts. This is not obvious to me, but it recalls Euler's famous pentagonal number theorem. More generally, let $t>0$ and let $c_n$ be the number of $t$-cores of $n$. Then $C_t(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n$ is the generating function for $t$-cores. Apart from $t=2$, there does not seem to be any simple description of $C_t(x)$, although it is known that $c_n>0$ for all $n$ and $t>3$ a prime. Then the $t$-abacus idea gives $$ \prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^i)^{-1}=\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^{ti})^{-t}C_t(x). $$ 

Yes. There is a finite board size that has essentially the same solution structure as all larger boards and an infinite board, and we can find it by solving the game completely for increasing board sizes until that ultimate size can be recognized. (The infinite board is different from a very large board only in that it has no edges or corners, so its solution structure is smaller.) Eventually this is possible, because there are only a finite number of pieces, and therefore only a finite number of equivalence classes of solution structures. When the number of such equivalence classes stops growing, we are done. Basically, all positions with pieces not close to the edge of the board but far from the center (say those with pieces inside an annulus) can be identified with more bounded positions (those surrounded by that annulus), because the pieces with an infinite number of options (Queen, Rook, Bishop) can go anywhere (up to parity) with no more than 2 moves, and the other pieces are forced to walk long distances for which all that matters are their relative path lengths to a certain precision. When one set of pieces moves far enough away from another set of pieces that the two sets are now in general position, these sub-problems interact in an equivalent way, so the description of the complete solution will eventually stop increasing with board size. More generally this strategy works for any chess-like game in which the pieces can be classified into "ultra-mobile" and "para-mobile" types with constant and linear freedom respectively. For example it is also true for checkers because all pieces are para-mobile. I am still unable to specify the equivalence between positions precisely enough to set an explicit bound on the necessary size of the finite board in terms of the number of pieces n, but I guess that it is O(f(n!)) for some polynomial function f whose order is O(n), or in other words O((n!)^(k*n)) for some k, using the construction technique that I have suggested. The super-exponential term is contributed by the para-mobile pieces and the polynomial by the ultra-mobiles. In any case I have intended only to demonstrate that the necessary board size has a computable bound. 

I am looking at $H^1(\mathbb{R}^n,G)$ where $G$ is a finite 2-group. I'm wondering if such things have been calculated. I'm afraid I can't say I know anything here, past the result that this calculates group extensions of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by $G$. Any related literature would also be appreciated. 

EDIT: I'm not very happy the the exposition below. But I hope you get the idea. Your proof is correct. Given a principal bundle with connection having the given curvature, and a second connection on a possibly different with the same curvature, the difference between the two is a bundle with a flat connection (note that the category of $U(1)$-bundles with connection is a symmetric 2-group). Thus one gets an ambiguity in the choice of bundle and connection. This information is reflected in the short exact sequence $$ 0 \to H^1(M,U(1)) \to \check{H}^1(M) \to \Omega^2_\mathbb{Z}(M) \to 0 $$ where the left cohomology group has discrete coefficients and classifies bundles with flat connections, and the group on the right is that of integral differential 2-forms on $M$. The central group is the ordinary differential cohomology of $M$. One way it may be thought of is as a moduli space (which has a group structure) of $U(1)$-bundles with connection. The right map is the map that sends a bundle with connection to its curvature form. There is another short exact sequence dealing with the characteristic class of the bundle, see Proposition 1 at this nLab page. It describes the kernel of the (surjective) homomorphism $\check{H}^1(M) \to H^2(M,\mathbb{Z})$, sending a bundle with connection to its first Chern class (which one can think of as being a Cech class). 

A square-free number with about $n$ bits that we can compute in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time is $n\#$, the primorial. Maybe it can be done in $O(n)$ but that's going to depend even more on the model. We can guess one and almost certainly be right with $\tilde{O}(1)$ time complexity ($O(1)$ if in this model we can check for divisibility by a constant in constant time). But to verify it the best I can think of is subexponential expected time by factoring it with GNFS. Apparently not as of 2011 (see page 3). 

P(A) = It is White's move and White has not yet won in position A. R(A, B) = Position B legally follows in one move from position A. Q(A, 0) = P(A) Q(A, t) = for all B: (R(A, B) -> there exists C: R(B, C) -> Q(C, t - 1)) S(A) = Q(A, 0) and (for all t: Q(A, t) -> Q(A, t + 1)) 

Here is a quick demonstration that it is effectively solvable for any number of parts. A sufficiently large number that has exactly one partition with the property must be prime. Otherwise we can write it as $n = a \cdot b$ with $1 < a \leq b$ and partition $b$ into $k$ parts in two different ways, then multiply them by $a$ to get two different partitions of $n$ with the property. Now suppose $n = 6 \cdot m + 35$. A sufficiently large $m$ has two different partitions into $k - 1$ parts such that each part of each partition is divisible by either $5$ or $7$. Multiplying by $6$ and appending $35$ then gives two different partitions of $n$ with the property. On the other hand, suppose $n = 6 \cdot m + 55 = 6 \cdot m + 5 \cdot 11$. The same logic above applies, and that covers all the cases. Filling in some more details results in a simple formula for an upper bound in terms of $k$: the first part says if $n$ is composite then $n \lt (k+2)^2$, and the second part chases down the primes relatively more quickly placing the largest one in $6 \cdot k + O(1)$. More generally still, we can require that the pairwise $\text{gcd}$ of the parts be greater than or equal to some $d \ge 2$ (so the question of $47$ corresponds to the case $d = 2$ and $k = 5$). An effective upper bound on unique solutions can still be obtained: we just have to carry out the above argument for all congruence classes mod $d$, in each case representing the remainder as a semiprime with prime factors larger than $d$. EDIT: That led me to the following even simpler version, working mod $2$ instead of mod $6$: if $m$ has two different partitions into $5$ parts, then $n = 2 \cdot m$ has two different partitions into $5$ parts, no two parts of which are relatively prime. So $n < 2 \cdot (5+2) = 14$ if $n$ is even. Otherwise, suppose $n = 2 \cdot m + 15$, and observe that $18 = 3+3+6+6 = 3+3+3+9$, $19 = 3+5+5+6 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 10$, and $20 = 3+3+5+9 = 3+5+6+6$ to conclude $m \le 17$ and $n \le 49$. 

I. G. Macdonald gives a very explicit formula for the coefficients in Example 24, p35 of the 2nd Edition of Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials. The example begins `Another involution on the ring $\Lambda$ may be defined as follows...' 

Look at I2.24 (an exercise!) in the book I.G. Macdonald, Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials, 2nd Ed., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995. Let $\lambda$ be a partition. Then for sufficiently large $n$ there is a corresponding conjugacy class $K_\lambda(n)$ of $S_n$ (got by ignoring $1$'s in $\lambda$). Use $+$ to denote the sum of the elements in the group algebra ${\mathbb Q}S_n$, we may write $$ K_\lambda(n)^+K_\mu(n)^+=\sum_\nu c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu(n)K_\nu(n)^+, $$ where the $c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu(n)$ are non-negative integers that depend on all $3$ partitions and on $n$. Say that each element of $K(\lambda)$ can be written as a product of $\ell(\lambda)$ transpositions, but no fewer. Throw away the $\nu$ for which $\ell(\nu)<\ell(\lambda)+\ell(\mu)$. Then the resulting $c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu(n)=c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu$ are independent of $n$ (H. K. Farahat, G. Higman, The centres of symmetric group rings, Proc. Royal Soc. London A 250 (1959) 212-221.). Now let $H(t)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-tx_i)^{-1}$ be the generating function for the complete symmetric functions. Suppose that $H(t)$ has Lagrange inverse $H^*(t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty h_n^*t^n$. Then the corresponding symmetric functions $h_n^* $ are algebraically independent. Set $h_\lambda^*=\prod h_{\lambda_i}^*$. Denote the dual (w.r.t. the usual symmetric bilinear form on symmetric functions) of $h_\lambda$ by $K_\lambda$, for each partition $\lambda$. Then Macdonald shows that the $K_\lambda$ form a basis for symmetric functions whose multiplication constants are: $$ K_\lambda^+K_\mu^+=\sum_\nu c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu K_\nu. $$ 

This works fine at least up to line four where Q(A, t) is defined recursively. If Q(A, t) could be defined as a predicate in Presburger arithmetic then I think line five would also work. But this is a serious problem and maybe breaks the whole approach. 

That there are such expressions is not surprising to me, but I am intrigued by the fact that they are so short, and particularly that the last two (the shortest) have very large first counterexamples. So I was thinking why not look at all short rulesets and see how they can be categorized. For example, I'd like to know the shortest ruleset with possibly undecidable convergence. I'd also like to be able to characterize some of the decidable ones. Is there a short ruleset whose convergence is undecidable in PA? I know we can state Goodstein's theorem with a new base-bumping symbol but I wonder if that's necessary. Similarly, is there a short ruleset whose convergence is equivalent to the existence of infinitely many Mersenne primes? I found the Riesel number example while trying to construct one — it seems like a new symbol for exponentiation is needed for this. In both cases I understand Conway's construction gives a ruleset whose convergence is equivalent, but it won't be a very short one. Can we build a small ruleset whose convergence is equivalent to some complexity class separation or equivalence like $\text{P} = \text{NP}$? Otherwise is there any simple extension of the language that can express this? I don't see any obstruction since these are usually $\Pi_2$ sentences like twin primes. And aside from whether all numbers converge, is there a short ruleset whose convergence from any starting point corresponds to some non-trivial property of that starting point? In this context "trivial" means something like "is an odd composite" as in the third example. One general fact I deduced is this: the question of whether there exists a path from $x$ to $y$ with length less than some fixed $\ell$ is in $\text{NP}$ (because factoring is also in $\text{NP}$ and we can produce a $(\log(x) + \log(y))^{O(1)}$-bit certificate showing how the numbers in the path match the rules). And in the other direction we can arithmetize a $\text{SAT}$ instance into a single rule, so deciding if $2 \rightarrow 1$ is an $\text{NP}$-hard problem on rulesets. The former property of constant paths being in $\text{NP}$, however useful it may or may not be in explaining the overall situation, is preserved by certain extensions (for example if we introduce variables taking square-free values, or variables with implicit order constraints) but is not preserved by others (such as a $2^x$ operator which would permit short paths with small endpoints and large intermediate values). A compact way of representing a ruleset that I'm considering is this, using the twin primes example: . Here I'm making addition implicit in concatenation and using as a symbol for $-1$. This keeps the alphabet small, although I don't think I'll have enough computer power to consider every well-formed string up to this length. But there are lots of symmetries, redundancies, and easy proofs, so it is possible to reduce the space significantly. If I write a program to analyze all short rulesets, what should I make it look for to help me get some insight into these issues? 

Question: how does one enumerate all star-convex $2n$-vertex sublattices of the plane that have the unique domino-tiling property? Definitions: A subset S of the xy-plane is star-convex if there is a point s in S such that the line segment [st] is contained in S for every t in S. For example the Young diagram of a partition is star convex with s taken as the origin. A sublattice G of the plane is a bipartite graph whose vertices are some points in the plane with integer coordinates. Two vertices in G whose x-coordinates differ by 1 or whose y-coordinates differ by 1 are joined by an edge. A tiling of a graph by dominos (dimer covering or perfect matching) is a collection of edges such that every vertex belongs to exactly one edge in the tiling. Motivating example: For $n\geq1$ there is a bijection between the Young diagrams of $2n$ which have a unique tiling by dominos and two copies of the set of partitions of $n$. We see this as follows: Represent the partition of $2n$ using beads on a $2$-runner abacus (as explained in James & Kerber's book The Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group). Moving a bead on a runner into a space immediately above it on the abacus correspond to the removal of a domino (2 adjacent boxes) from the diagram. The Young diagram has a tiling by dominos if and only if there are an equal number of beads on each runner (the partition has an empty 2-core). The tiling is unique if one runner is the bead sequence of a partition of $n$ and the other runner represents the empty partition. Specific Examples: For $2n=2,4,6$ only the hook partitions $[k,1^{2n-k}]$ have a unique tiling by dominos. In addition to the $8$ hook partitions of $2n=8$, the partitions $[4,3,1]$ and $[3,2^2,1]$ have unique tilings. These correspond to the partition $[2^2]$ of $n=4$.
