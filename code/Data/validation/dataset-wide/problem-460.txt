I usually use an old spoke nipple. Slide it over the end and crimp with an electrical (stake-on/solderless connector) crimper. 

In the very last image of the video there appears to be a small screw hole in the caliper. Looking from the right side of the bike it is behind the exposed cable, between the adjuster and the cable clamp. That screw will adjust the spring tension. Turning the screw "in" will increase the tension on the spring. The increased tension will delay the brake movement relative to the other side. Based on your video I would think you need to back the screw out. Start with 1/4 turns. As others have commented if you can't adjust the issue away it may be time to strip them down and clean and lubricate the pivot points. 

It is do-able at a reasonable cost if you do the work yourself. Your current derailleur likely does not have the tooth capacity for a 14-34t freewheel. The mount on a new derailleur wont mount to your bike if it uses the older style that is held by the axle nuts. Luckily there is an adapter available for about $5. Your chain will also be too short and too wide for for the new rear cog . The narrower 7 speed chain should work with your current crank. You will also need an appropriate freewheel tool and chain whip to remove the freewheel. A local bike shop may do this task for less than the cost of buying the tools. If you are using friction (non index) shifters they will also work. Based on average EBay prices of less than $20 each for a derailleur, chain and freewheel you will invest less than $100. The plus is when you are done you will know how to install and adjust the derailleur, shorten the chain some basic tuning. 

The advantages of investment casting are: Excellent surface finish High dimensional accuracy Extremely intricate parts are castable Almost any metal can be cast No flash or parting lines 

I am a cotton man year round, I guess it depends on where you live and just how stylish you wish to look. 

Never liked them myself, too much movement for me. Its a preference, and performance of that type of seat may be affected by the weight of the rider. 

This brought to mind an interesting question, is it more expensive to feed yourself per mile cross country than it is to buy gasoline on a per mile basis, I know this is quite subjective and may not be easily answered due to the fact that different vehicles use fuel at different rates and gasoline and food costs are different in other countries. So lets set some reasonable parameters. Food energy cost vs gasoline costs. USA 22 mpg car Reasonably loaded Big Dummy's (all the gear, and a few comforts you need to make camp cross country) They had high quality lightweight camping equipment from what I could tell. Max cargo capacity including rider is 400lbs on the Big Dummy. LA California to Denver, scenic routes. Food costs: are higher due to inconvenient places to shop and limited carrying capacity and food spoilage issues. Has anyone ever done a study on this subject or kept track on a long bike trip cross country? 

If they are not full floating calipers, most are not, then the problem may be the fixed side of the caliper pad has worn and you need to adjust the fixed side pad closer to the rotor (eliminate the gap) The squeal comes from the movable pad pushing (flexing) the rotor over to make contact with the fixed pad. This type of caliper needs periodic adjustment of the fixed pad as the pad wears. 

There are several suppliers of universal derailleur hangers. The intended use is to mount a modern derailleur to vintage bikes. At one time the derailleur hanger was part of the derailleur and mounted under the axle nut. Cambria Bike.com Harris Cyclery both have several models that start at $1.00. You could also try to find one of the older derailleurs like a Shimano Tourney mega range that have the hanger built onto the derailleur they can be had for under $25. 

To add a rear disc brake you must have a frame with a disc mount. You will also need a rear wheel that has a disc compatible hub. Unless you find a really good deal on something used you will spend more than the bike is worth. If you feel the rear V brakes were insufficient, your money would be better spent getting quality shoes for the rear. Some riders claim good quality V shoes work as well as low end discs. 

If the bike was originally fitted with 27" wheels,(which most 70's to early 80's bikes were) you will be limited to only one or two sizes,1 1/4" and 1 3/8" and tread patterns are also limited. I currently have two bikes running 27" wheels. The 1 1/4" tire is 32mm wide inflated,the 1 3/8" is 29mm inflated. So two tires from two makers and the smaller is the widest. As has been stated there were no standards. My Mafacs calipers are at the bottom of the slot just to reach the brake surface on a 27" wheel. Long reach brakes may not have enough adjustment to position the brake pads correctly if you change to a 650 or 700c wheel. I would say that your best option is to borrow or buy returnable parts to work out all the variables you are going to encounter. 

I was an automotive mechanic for quite a few years, yes I did get quite greasy when young and dumb, I used Naptha to get the grease out of my jeans, worked well, but it did make the washer a bit smelly, I Kept some naptha in a spray bottle, I sprayed the grease spots right before washing and used extra soap. This worked quite well for many years. There were only a few "stains" it did not get out over the years, but I think this was other contaminants besides oil and grease, but it always removed the grease completely. I never experienced any negative side effects for the washing machine besides the after smell. 

I was on vacation at Mesa Verde Nat park this year, I met a nice couple bicycling cross country from California, they were riding reasonably loaded Surly Big Dummy's. They were surprised at the calories burned and the cost of food on the road to keep up energy levels. They said they could do 35 miles on a very good day, averaged 20, mind you they were in South West Colorado headed to central Colorado, lots of steep climbs. They set up camp every night and cooked what they had at the time, basically living on the road toting all the gear on the back of the bikes, guitar and all, awesome guitar player by the way. . 

A general rule for flat belts is to twist the belt midway between the front and rear belt drives, it should twist to 90 degrees with moderate two finger effort, if it goes past 90, then it is too loose, if you cannot make 90 without great effort, then it is too tight. This method depends on how strong your fingers are and the width and thickness of the belt, the more you use this method the better you get at judging what is correct for any given belt. Another method is to make small tension adjustments until the slippage stops. 

A variety of manufacturers make snap in wedge bag mounts. The mount attaches to the saddle rails and the bag snaps into the mount. Does know which brands if any interchange? 

We see many posts requesting help identifying bikes. Many older models had brand specific shapes or unique frame lugs that help identify them. With a few exceptions most modern bike frames have a generic shape. When you consider most frames are built in China in just a few factories it is easy to see why they all look similar. There is also some amount of multiple branding. Gary Fisher frames are made by Trek. Derby Cycles owns Focus, Univega, Nishiki and Raliegh brands. Dorel Cycles owns Pacific, IronHorse, Schwinn, Mongoose and Cannondale. This not to say that all the bikes made by a single conglomerate are the same quality. Just that there may be design influences that carryover betweem brands especially the one at the lower end of the product line. 

Looking at the photo I notice that the nut is missing,an indication that it has been worked on at some point. With the right side pedal in the 9 o'clock position the nut side of the pin will face up verify that the leftarm pin has the nut on the bottom.Several size pins were used and it is possible that you have two different sizes.I have several cottered cranks and it seems that there is no standard as far as which direction the pin goes on which side but they are always facing in opposite directions. 

I like the idea of using epoxy. Making sure it compatible with the materials being used. One issue with the nutsert on a tube is there is only full flange contact at the 12 oclock and 6 oclock positions. This makes it susceptible to becoming loose from side to side loads. Follow the manufacturers directions for the exact drill size required. Depending on the frame design you may need a right-angle drill or a short bit to get the correct position.
