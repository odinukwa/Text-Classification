With respect, I think that this suggests a slight misunderstanding of what Rawls is arguing. He is well aware that people are not created equal. However, what he does believe is that every individual should be taken to have equal moral status i.e. our considerations of justice shouldn't start from the starting point of preferential treatment towards some. (I would imagine - or hope! - that very few would disagree with this as a fundamental part of the definition of 'justice'.) So, we're trying to work out fair principles that treat everyone as morally equally important, but these principles are to govern over a situation where people are not equal in strength, mental ability, inherited wealth, social connections, and so on. Now, if we actual people were to try to design these principles then it seems likely that, say, on the whole the weakest or poorest might try to design principles that put their interests above all others, whereas the wealthiest and most powerful might try to design principles that maintain their status. The naturally physically strongest might try to design principles that link power to physical aptitude. And so on - and this doesn't seem fair, or workable. So, how can we avoid this situation? Rawls thinks that we can avoid it by undertaking a thought experiment: if none of us actually knew anything about our social status, strengths/weaknesses, race, gender, etc., but knew that we were about to enter into a society that we were going to have to be happy in, what principles would we choose? What is actually going on here is that the method, in the thought experiment, of depriving the deliberating parties of information is a way of building in fairness and impartiality into the deliberation. The parties can't possibly be *un*fair to one another in their choice of principles because they wouldn't know how, and wouldn't know whether their choices would actually disadvantage themselves. As such, whatever principles these imaginary parties would choose will be fair and impartial. Now, we could argue about exactly what principles the parties behind the veil would actually choose, but, at any rate, the above is the method and whatever else we might say one can understand the thinking behind it and appreciate the philosophical elegance. I think it would be a mistake to suggest that it relies on the idea that people could be 'exchanged'; firstly, it is just a thought experiment designed to generate certain kinds of conclusions in the right way, and so doesn't really have a lot to do with actual people, and secondly, its aim is to arrive at principles that can ensure the just social co-existence of people who, indeed, aren't interchangeable. 

I think I read above that this isn't a forum for opinion so I'll move swiftly on from that one (!...) but I think again Rawls's answer would centre around the idea of the equal moral status of persons (at least at birth). Clearly, many would argue that during life people through their agency makes choices that mean that they 'deserve' or 'don't deserve' certain things, but Rawls thinks that in the eyes of justice every person is still equal; no matter how 'good' or 'bad', people don't earn preferential treatment from justice (we wouldn't say that someone who gives to charity should get away with murder, or that people who are mean to their friends should be stripped of their wealth). Rawls isn't really interested in what people 'deserve' through their deeds (for that you want Robert Nozick) or through some idea of their innate virtue, but rather in having a social system that isn't predestined to militate against the life chances of particular people and groups. 

I think you are asking two separate questions here. First, is it ethical to be proud of one's country? And second, can you be proud of something that you did not create? The first, as others have mentioned, is dependent on what you use to define your ethics. In most ethical systems, to have pride in (which is different from being possessed by hubris) is amoral. If a country is doing something which is ethical, then it is good to be pleased in that country. If a country is doing something unethical, then it is good to be ashamed of it. Most of the time a country, because it is made up of people, is like a person, and is in a much more complicated situation than merely being one or the other. The second is an entirely different question. You can be proud of things you do not create, but are a part of. I am a part of my family. I like being a part of my family, and am proud of them for their accomplishments. I may have influenced the way my family is, but I did not create my family. I was merely given the opportunity to be part of it. The same for a club, or a college, or a community. A country is just much larger, and you are a much smaller part of it. But you can still be proud of this collective identity if you so choose, and the ethics of that seem mostly irrelevant to most ethical systems. In general, however, I do not believe that most people who are proud of their country are applying the kinds of critical analysis that they would of other things. Because a country is such an abstract notion, and a person's idea of something can stray so far from the actual reality of it, I think many people end up with a harmful, blind, and unconditional approval of one's country despite all evidence to the contrary. Like recurring domestic violence between a husband and wife, where one or the other is unable to admit the fault or wrongdoing of the other. People tend to think it is wrong to apply value judgments to something they love, but that kind of detached, uncritical sense of loyalty actually turns out to do more harm than good. 

Most philosophy begins with a question. I'm wondering why certain questions provoke more profound thoughts than others. What characteristics do good questions share with each other? How can we go about finding worthy problems to seek solving? For example, questions of ontology have led to much stimulating thought: What exists? How did it come to be? What does it mean to be? Questions about the nature of the universe have led to great advances in scientific thought: Does this phenomena happen every time? Under what conditions would this hold? Is this possible? Socratic questioning has brought us to the depths of the human soul, enabling us to examine the complex nature of the human mind and glean otherwise elusive truths: What makes you say that? Could you explain further? But what about...? In the perennial book How to Solve It, mathematician George PÃ³lya, lays out a framework for solving problems by a series of progressively penetrating questions: 

(from the Catechism of the Catholic Church) Now, we must find a thought with a morally good object, end, and circumstance (which here means something that is a superset of typical usages for 'consequence'). Any such thought will suffice, because our definition of 'immoral' requires only that an action be "deemed improper by the modi operandi of a given society" and societies are quite capable of deeming anything improper. Most readers, I think, will agree at least one of the following suffices: 

Mu In short, asking about religion in the context of philosophy without defining your terms does not a good discussion make. 'Dogma' requires definition, for us to tell if atheism has that/is that or not. 'Religion' would probably benefit from definition, given that you ask "Is atheism supposed to be only anti-religious". 'Atheism' most certainly would benefit from definition. Depending on the definitions you propose, the answer can be quite different. In many cases, atheism has dogma, meaning that it is a perspective or system of belief (and, obviously, has foundational tenets in these cases). In other cases, atheism is a dogma prescribed as foundational for certain systems of belief/perspectives on the world. In other cases, atheism is neither a system of belief nor a belief and thus neither has nor can be dogma. In yet further cases, dogma isn't necessarily entailed by a system of belief, so atheism can be a special unicorn system with no dogma. In still other cases, things are defined unconventionally and anything can happen. 

I believe this to be a reasonable definition for this question's purposes as you give examples from a Judeo-Christian background, though it is possible, given your very unusual choices for the definitions of other terms, that this is an error in premise. 

This comic by Corey Mohler does a good job of addressing this question. In short, because said people find a sort of short-sighted "New Atheism" convenient for maintaining the marginalization of women and other oppressed groups and preventing social change in general. While this position may seem quite harsh, it is well supported in the case of Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, as the lengthy explanation following the comic shows. Most of that explanation (the parts relevant to the discussion at hand) are reproduced below: 

There were some links to explanations of topics like 'logical positivism' in the original that are not preserved here, since they aren't strictly necessary. The linked youtube video is an excerpt from an interview with Mr. Hitchens where he talks broadly about how women should stay home and raise children and men should go get jobs. At one point he says "No. I'm not having any woman of mine go to work." The interviewer then says "You know you're going to get in trouble if you go down there" (Mr. Hitchens tries to say something over this about halfway through her talking, but I'm not sure what. Possibly "No, no they-- no, they-- I don't--". In any case, I think he's just trying to interrupt and the line I can't quite make out isn't critical). Mr. Hitchens then says "No, they don't need to work. They can if they like, but they don't have to". The interviewer then says "You are joking, aren't you?" to which he replies "No, I'm not. No, I would expect her to take care-- Well, you can work if you want, but you don't have to." 

Work is necessary to be happy because people have a fundamental need to create. Marx points out that modern systems of capitalism have divorced workers from the means of production and from reaping the benefits of their work. I think addressing this is a core problem of our present age. 

If you're looking for something a little easier to read, I've found Brian Greene's Fabric of the Cosmos to be a good balance of informative, entertaining, and understandable. 

Well, I think the question is, does the very act of shooting a man make you culpable for his death, or are you only responsible for the way your act has changed the outcome? That is, are you culpable for any exercise of free will, or are you simply culpable for the consequences of your actions? I lean towards the former. That is, the act itself is wrongdoing, not just its consequence. 

That is precisely what the question is asking. It is just restating it another way. Taking out all the lies, however, in the context or pure logic results in a tautologyâsomething necessarily "true" by virtue or form. I guess the philosophic answer depends largely on your definition of "truth". I lean towards the idea that lies are the twisting of truth, and not the other way around. A distinction I make with an analogy. Truth is like pure water. Lies are everything else in the same bottle trying to blend in. 

There is a big jump from "is the absence of something" to "doesn't exist." I think most of the responses here, taken from the English stackexchange, were more focused on the language of it than the logic of it. For example, @chaos, 

This has helped me solve many a perplexing problem in the past. There is Stackexchange itself, which is a cornucopia of useful thought provoking information all driven around the asking of questions. And lastly, there is the all time favorite of children everywhere: Why? 

I can say something without thinking it, just as I can think something without saying it. Therefore, I'd argue that "I think" is not implied in all language statements, but rather, "I say", "I state" or "I assert". From that perspective, the paradox resolves itself. 

I think tolerance is mostly a neutral thing. It can be used in good ways and it can be used in bad ways. Writer Iain McGilchrist alludes to the idea of a necessary distance in order for bonds to form. He compares it to reading. Too close, and you can't see anything. Too far, and you can't read it. I agree with Joseph here that in Western cultures the umbrella of tolerance is often used as an excuse to continue a sort of hypocritical, simultaneous, drawing near to and examining less of. We have let people into our necessary distance in order for bonds to form, but we have looked the other way. A shortcut has been taken. That is, if we had continued to examine the beliefs of others and drew them near at the same time, I believe, we could achieve a kind of love that we have for our family members who although we disagree with we still stick to. But because we are initially repulsed by the beliefs of others, things we do not know or understand, in the West we have drawn people near by looking awayâand this intimate ignorance has brought on grave consequences because we cannot look away forever. Near things collide. Almost always. The longer two things are together, the higher chance there is that they will collide. I think what people desire when they cling onto ideals and slogans of tolerance and oneness are these bonds that form with necessary distance. They just got the order wrong. They did not want to take the step of self- and other-examinationâbecause it's difficult and costly. What people say they want when they talk of tolerance, what I think they usually mean but are too afraid to ask for, is love.
