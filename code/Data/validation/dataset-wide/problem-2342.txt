I need to decide whether or not to sell the device without using it, otherwise the price will fall down - and I'm the first among my friends to have one of these, which means I can't just borrow one and test it. I've read multiple reviews, but everyone's just praising the device and the criticism is mostly expressed as "this brake is made to help beginners, and its functions should make the life of someone who just started to climb much easier". The thing is that an anti-panic handle, lead and top rope modes and stainless steel reinforcements mean pretty much nothing to me. What would really make me choose to keep this device are advantages 3 and 5: if it's really much easier to pay slack with this thing, and if it wears the rope less, then I'll keep it. All disadvantages are really important to me, specially 3 and 4. Check the picture below. Notice how the back of Grigri2's casing (right) was smartly substituted by a new chamber design on the Grigri+ (left)... But notice also how the area to place your finger has disappeared in the Grigri+ (you can't see it in this picture, but the small orange button to place your finger is flat and not very anatomical). 

According to the most comprehensive reference ever written on bowlines, the EBSB bowline (which is a variation of another variation, called the EBDB bowline, together with a sort of Yosemite finish) is probably the safest easily undone tie-in knot for climbing. It looks like this: 

Since you're asking how to get from the UK to somewhere, I'll assume you're an UK citizen. Below you'll find a picture that shows your visa requirements. 

As I said in the comments, I believe my findings deserve an answer on their own. These matters are urgent and I'm a little troubled by what I've found. I've sent emails to three major rope manufacturers (Petzl, Beal, Mammut). Only Mammut cared to even write me an answer - which made me feel lonely and friendless. But anyway, I don't think there would be any major difference between all answers I would receive. Remember I asked for clarification about topics that are not contained in either EN 892 or the UIAA standard. Regarding UV Exposure Mammut clarified this point in a way that makes sense to me. We should not be worried about UV damage to the rope because the sheath, which is approximately 1mm thick, breaks the UV before it hits the core. This is true for all modern ropes, and some of them actually exaggerate: Sterling's Marathon Pro has a double sheath, which I believe makes this rope's half-life sort of infinite. Regarding Temperature Range Mammut says warm temperatures are not a major concern and that they have tested this internally. At this point I sent another email saying that testing stuff internally doesn't convince me unless some statistics are shown to me. Mammut said that they couldn't sent me any statistics, and that they tested the ropes both for the standard temperature (23ºC) and an extreme temperature (50ºC). They say the outcome was the same. I don't believe it. I think there are significant changes in elasticity - but I do believe it's not dangerous to climb in the heat, it only wears your rope significantly more and might turn the catch stiffer if you regularly take whippers in the heat (my opinion). Regarding low temperatures, my hint was correct: it might not be safe to climb in extremely low temperatures. According to Mammut, cold temperatures might shrink the rope in up to 10% of its length - this makes the catch stiffer. I don't think it would be stiff enough to hurt someone or to break the rope, but I do think taking a factor 2 fall on a frozen rope is not at all a good idea. A major problem about climbing in low temperatures has to to with the heat generated in the impact melting the ice and the rope becoming wet. Regarding Wet Ropes This is where the problem is real. According to Mammut, I should not be worried about my rope unless it is wet. Some home-made studies address both the problem of water and dirt on ropes. I also remember having read (I won't look for this reference right now, but I think it was UIAA itself) that climbing ropes might lose up to 80% of their resistances if wet. The combination of water and dirt might be specially dangerous. Mammut said that they have a very strict method for building dry ropes because water is so dangerous - and that sort of makes me wonder why the hell people still build ropes with non-dry treatment. 

This figure is obviously about ropes, but it also applies to slings. Check you sling fibre structure: if it looks as anything above a 4 in the picture, retire it. 

Which means that, since you're not worried about the fact that the sling got longer, but if it got weaker, the answer is no - at least superficially. You can confirm your sling is still intact by looking at its fibre structure (taken from balance community's website): 

C1 sets off with R1 and R2, same way as before; C1 arrives at the belay, fixes both R1 and R2; C2 helps lower out C3, which will jug the fixed line R2; C3 arrives at belay with C2 still waiting. After arriving, C3 sends a signal to C2 to start lowering off the pigs; C2 lowers off the pigs and starts jugging the fixed line R1 and cleaning the pitch. Meanwhile, C3 and C1 are hauling the pigs; When hauling is done, C2 is probably halfway cleaning, and C1 or C3 can start leading a new pitch. Hopefully C2 will arrive at belay before the leader is halfway through, because most of the gear will be hanging with C2; 

Then attaching one or two opposing locking carabiners to the loop of your harness. You should never: 

Now that's what I call a big picture. I can modify my EBDB bowline until it looks exactly like this knot. I'm pretty sure it's the very same, but I want to be over-sure. I can't find a reference that teaches to tie this knot step by step anywhere. Can someone help? 

Now let's think it's somehow possible to fill a hole with water from a fixed position, very close to the wall. This would diminish greatly the turbulence effects due to water evading the end of the hole. 

Now, when dealing with one more person, things start to get a little weirder, since there are many possible strategies. A possible one I was thinking about is Method 1: 

There are several types of dyneema and some of them have lower creep resistance. Balance community says 

But let's be honest: that's impossible. Conquering a route is stressful enough to think a climber would be able to place a water straw in a fixed position. The dust would eventually get moisturised. The only missing situation is where the climber removes the dust with air first, then injects water in for some "I have no idea" reason. This is safer, since the powder would be already out, but I'm pretty sure it would make locking the bolt casing harder, since it would reduce the friction between the casing and the rock. It also looks incredibly pointless, since the dust would be already out and the water would activate the rock's chemical properties much more efficiently - and that's some efficiency you don't want. Conclusion: I don't think you should do that. Follow the bolting manuals and use air. It's perfectly safe, you don't have to carry it, and it has never failed before. 

Conclusion: don't worry about the UV, and unless you're climbing in an icy environment with a non-dry rope, don't worry too much about low temperatures - but keep in mind your rope might be much shorter. Don't take factor 2 whippers (ever, if possible), since in extreme cold they might really hurt or break you up. High temperatures are not dangerous, but your rope will wear out faster climbing in them. Also, high temperatures might come together with high humidity, which is the only thing you should be really worried about. Curiosity of the day: manufacturers like Mammut do take a seat in the meetings that decide changes in norms and standards. This means they can do something about what's missing in them, if they want. I'm inclined to say that if they are not insisting on including these things in the norms, it's a little because they don't matter much and a little because no one wants to spend more money doing more tests - even if they would clarify a lot. 

You have two options: coming from above (crossing to Russia) and coming from below (crossing the whole Turkey). I'm pretty sure you'll pick the second choice, since Ukraine is at war and you'd need a rather expensive Russian visa if you chose the first one. Then, even if you choose to cross non-EU countries like Montenegro and Serbia, you'd only need to show your passport at a verification post, located in some specific cities (you necessarily have everything checked if you go by train of bus). It is very easy to cross without passing through a post, but I would never advise that. That's a crime and you can get easily caught when leaving the country. Going from below you'd have to necessarily pass through Turkey (cross it, actually). Here's a list of land borders in Turkey. You'd have to necessarily pass through one of them and have your passport stamped. As you saw in the visa requirements, you have the right to ask for an eVISA to Turkey, and I advise you to apply before you start your trip. You probably won't have any problems getting it, but remember: you can't stay in Turkey for longer than 3 months. Then you're in Georgia. No visas required. Enjoy! 

I just got a sample of Petzl's new assisted braking device, the Grigri+. I must admit I look at it with a lot of disdain, mostly because 

I can only answer from my personal perspective. It might not be statistically relevant, but I dare say it could be a little generalisable. I have been climbing actively (more than 3 days a week), both indoors and outdoors, for the past 3+ years. I have climbed with beginners and was mentored by people that climb since the 1990s. Most of my climbing partners today have around 10 years of experience, and I know most of their trajectories within climbing from their stories. I have also taught climbing to 5 or 6 people and watched them blossom. First of all, I strongly believe people "plateau" at a grade mostly because they have the wrong mindset. It might be possible that a large group of people usually get stuck at a certain grade, but by discussing this with everyone else, that grade ends up being mystified. Even people that wouldn't normally find those grades very hard end up being beaten by the majority - that was my case with 5.12. See my answer in the link the OP attached to his question for a more thorough development of these ideas. Also, there is an extremely important age component. From my perspective this is very easy to identify. Beside the obvious metabolic component, people usually think that if you start climbing early, your body will have more ease to adapt to the harsh conditions climbing exposes you to - and that's very, very true, but there's more: children are not discouraged by the myths adult create around a grade. A children/teenager doesn't give a damn about 5.12 being "so hard" for so many people: they just go there and send. Everyone remembers how reckless we were when we were teenagers... This also leaks to climbing. Now that the introduction has been duly made, we can cut to the business. People usually get stuck at the transitions between
