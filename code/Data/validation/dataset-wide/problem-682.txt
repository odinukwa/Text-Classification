Gear 1 indicates the largest cog on the rear. It will be the easiest to pedal and make you go the slowest for a given pedal speed. You want lower gears for slow speed, whether from going uphill, being lazy, or whatever cause. They allow you to maintain your desired pedaling cadence. 

You don't say how young and foolish you are. Many years ago, at age 17, I rode a double century (a little over 300 km) with about that much climbing with no training at all. I had never ridden more than 50 km in a day. The weather was much cooler than 30C. The hard part about the second trip would have been psychological-I found the double to be much more than was fun. I rode a number of centuries, 160 km, afterward and found them fun, but the double took 16 hours. I was on a decent 1960's road bike. If you have done 200 km already, you have a good idea what it takes. You can get a lot stronger in 2-3 months of training. Go for it. 

Take it in steps. If you can do 12 miles now, think about how tired you are at the end of it. You should have a feeling whether you could just do it again, or sit and have a snack and do it again, or have lunch and do it again. Just try it. Plot a route 18-20 miles and try that. See how easy it feels, then lengthen it more. For 80-100 miles you will be riding all day, so you need an exertion level that you can maintain for that long. If you can ride two hours and feel like you could ride two more at the same pace, that is probably good for all day. 

The heavier person will present more area to the wind, but this is mitigated by two factors: The bicycle presents a fixed area to the wind and the area presented by the heavier person is not proportional because of the 2/3 power law. If you just scale up a rider by a factor in mass, the volume increases in proportion, but the frontal area scales up as the 2/3 power of the weight ratio because the dimension along the direction of travel does not contribute. Both of these mean a heavy rider on a bike with a constant grade will descend faster with no power input besides the hill. 

I downloaded ridewithGPS for voice cues on my iPhone 6. It works even while the display is off, which should solve the battery issue. I have only tried it on a 3 hour ride, and had lots of power left. I planned to use it for a 6 hour ride, but rain canceled it. You have to use one of the pay versions to get this. 

I see two possible explanations. One is psychological and one is physical. The psychological one is that these are the new toy, so you want to find a reason they are good. This effect is much more powerful than most people are aware of, let alone willing to admit. It validates your decision to buy those wheels. If you want to disprove this, you can hide all the distinguishing marks on the wheels (very hard) and see if you can tell the difference. The physical explanation is that you can find a transfer function from vibrations on the ground to vibrations on the points you touch the bike, the saddle, the handlebars, and the pedals. I suspect the saddle is the most important as you have your legs and arms to damp the vibrations from the others. The wheels only contact at the ends of the axle, so if the frame damps some frequencies we can ignore those. A more rigid wheel will transmit higher frequency vibrations to the frame, which will show up at your contact points unless the frame damps them. There is a belief in the community that rigid is good. Generally, a more rigid wheel will absorb less energy in flexing than a less rigid wheel. The energy lost in the flex of the wheel is one part of the rolling resistance of the bicycle. There are many others. At normal riding speeds air resistance is dominant so reducing rolling resistance is not as productive as it looks. If you are a racer a tiny edge is important. As a recreational rider, I would like a comfortable ride. All of this doesn't answer the question your are asking-how can I look at the specs of a wheel and identify the comfortable ones as opposed to the harsh ones. I would have thought most of the damping was in the tire, so there wouldn't be much difference in wheels, but I haven't tried any besides the ones my bike came with. I suspect on average you will get more comfortable wheels if you buy cheaper ones, but that is based on my thought that high end wheels are oriented for racing, so want to minimize energy lost at all costs. 

Adding two or four teeth to the largest chainring will not improve you high gear very much. Right now your highest ratio is 48/14=3.429. Going to 52 will get you to 52/14=3.714, which is not much of an improvement. It is better to focus on the rear, where 48/11=4.364 Going to a new wheel set you need to check that the wheel is the proper width for the frame. The space between the lugs might be 126,130, or 135 mm. 

If you have 34-50T on the front, a common "compact" size, you only have two chain rings. There is no middle gear, which are only found on triple chain ring setups. The smaller gear is for lower speeds, the larger gear is for higher speeds. As indicated in the comments, the ranges available with the two chain rings probably overlap, so the highest gears you can get with the 34 are duplicated by the lowest gears you can get with the 50. That way, if you are in the 50, you can shift down for a while without changing the chain ring, then shift back up when conditions change. 

The thing that makes road bikes unsuitable off good pavement is their narrow, high pressure tires. The gearing and seating position may not be ideal, but they are not killers. For a short stretch, you just need to get through it. Hard packed dirt is no problem unless there are ruts along the direction of travel that cause control problems. A thin layer of sand or gravel over a hard surface is also not a problem as long as you corner gently. The problem comes if you have a soft surface that cannot support your tire pressure or sharp rocks that puncture a thin road tire. These can quickly ruin your day. Long stretches of the other surfaces may make you wish you had a different bike, but tell your friend that beggars can't be choosers and pick a route that doesn't have too much of them. 

I have taken to wearing an ear cover routinely, regardless of the temperature. I like it because it pads the helmet and acts as a sweatband, but it also reduces the wind noise in my ears. You could try that. 

I am currently riding an entry level carbon road bike (Fuji Gran Fondo 2.5, compact 50/34 crankset, 105 group, 12/30 10 speed, Oval 327 wheels, but I suspect the details are not important-you have all seen similar bikes on club rides) My typical ride is 30 miles and 1500 feet of climbing (as reported by Strava, if I add up the hills they are not this high) in 2 hours, so I am not a speed burner. The Gran Fondo is promoted as an "old guy's" (which I am) bike-the head tube is a bit longer (only 1/2 inch) than standard so you sit more upright, you get (my year, not now) the 30 tooth on the rear and the tires are 25 instead of 23. Will another bike blow me away if I ride it a short distance (5 miles) on the flat? How much time can I save at the same power input over the 30 mile ride? Let's pretend I have no budget limitation, I just want the fastest (easily available commercially) road bike for my use. How much faster is it than what I have? What would you look for? Don't send me looking for an 11 tooth on the cassette-I rarely use the 50/12. You need to send me to a class descending hills faster first. Added based on Craig Hicks answer: I have inverted the stem, which probably counteracts the longer head tube of the bike I have. I didn't notice any difference in comfort. I could take a couple spacers out of the the head tube to lower the bars another inch. I did a high end fit with my LBS with some comfort improvement but no speed. I suspect the biggest speed increase I could buy would be race tires that have less rubber so less flexure loss on the road at a price of durability. That is what I was looking for, what should I look for and how much would it speed me up?
