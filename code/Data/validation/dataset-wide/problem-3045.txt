There were a series of compromises1 2 3 during the early 1800's designed to keep a balance between slave and free states. These generally involved Congress drawing a line on a territorial map, and decreeing that slavery would be prohibited above that line. These compromises were viewed by many as necessary to hold the country together. Dred Scott at a stroke destroyed all those compromises, by ruling that Congress had no authority to outlaw slavery in any US territory. Southerners of course rejoiced at this. However angry northerners flocked to the new Republican Party over the next 4 years (the decision came just after the election of 1856) which had as its main platform the prevention of slavery's expansion into the territories. 

That's actually a more complicated question than it may seem. During WWII the Nazi government instituted price controls on things like bread, and the occupying UN powers didn't lift those controls until 1948. So bread's official price and its real ("black-market") price would have been very different things [pdf]. 

Colin's little quip at the end there I think was his way of saying he finds this argument a bit of a stretch. 

Almost certainly yes. The army Mehmed II sent against Constantinople probably had more fighting men in it than there were human beings (soldiers, residents, and refugees) in the city of Constantinople at the time. He owned all the land for hundreds of miles in either direction. Essentially, the city had been reduced to a small fort within the Ottoman state. It really no longer had much reason to exist. Secondly, its debatable that they had lost the knowledge. Wikipedia is currently saying Greek Fire was used to collapse tunnels Mehmed's sappers were digging under the city during the siege. That claim appears to be sourced from Rodger Crowley's 1453: The Holy War for Constantinople. Either way, it seems quite likely any supplies of it may have been quite limited due to the Greeks no longer controlling whatever territory its components were sourced from. 

Again, I haven't found anything about Valcarra. However the description does remind me of one (fictional) odd style I've seen in an MMO. I'll put it here not as an authoritative example, but to give an idea of what this might look like. 

A bit of quick research tells me the worst in absolute terms almost has to be 1918. There was a worldwide influenza epidemic that killed about 40 million people that year. That's the single biggest recorded death toll for a global pandemic in a single year in human history1. There also happened to be one of the bloodiest wars in human history (in terms of sheer number of combat deaths) going on at the time. For most years, roughly 3 million combat deaths would be a huge deal. That year it wasn't even 10% of what the flu did. Barring some new fast-moving pandemic, or a disaster of extinction-event proportions, that is liable to be the worst the human race will see for quite some time2. The number of deaths due to war is actually decreasing globally. 

It wasn't just about the Slavs; people everywhere were feeling this way. It essentially happened because the idea of Nationalism: that people in ethnically, geographically, culturally, and linguistically coherent areas should owe their allegiance only to their own single native governments, became a popular sentiment worldwide. Ethnic nationalism was in fact a big deal throughout the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries pretty much world-wide. Prime examples of this would be the German and Italian unification movements. Before these movements started there was no concept of a "Germany" or "Italy", except perhaps geographically, and at first both were just ideas in the heads of their proponents. The concept was enshrined in WWI allied propaganda, as well as the agreements that actually ended the war. It could also be said to have proven itself in the war, as by and large the nation-states performed far better in that war than did the polyglot "empires". After WWII, (and to a lesser extent between the wars), it had a great deal to do with the decolonization process in Asia, Africa, and India. 

By and large, we really don't know. The timing of archeological finds with the language distribution when the historical record opens makes a very compelling case for the Celto-Italics being the chief people who introduced farming to Western Europe. So any pre-Celtic inhabitants would have been Mesolithic (hunter-gatherers). Neolithic (farming) societies support an order of magnitude larger population than hunter-gatherers, so from the Celts' perspective the Western European territory they were moving into would have barely been inhabited at all. There were however some areas around the Mediterranean that managed to hit the Neolithic before the Indo-Europeans arrived. These are (probably not coincidentally) the areas that still had non- Indo-European societies when the historical record opens. The two main groups here are the Basques (who are still around) and the Tyrrhenians (who are not). There are lots of theories about a possible prehistoric wider distribution for the Basque ancestors. Sadly most of these theories have been discredited. One that has not (but is still not really a majority opinion), is Vasconic, which is a name for a putative Basque ancestor covering all of Spain and the British Isles, and the western half of France. 

Stressful places and/or places where a person is expected to just chill for a while would be particularly effective for inducing all present nicotine addicts into lighting up, as enhancing focus and inducing calm are that drug's two primary effects. Quite likely most of the people who today take ADHD/ADD meds as adults would back in the 20th Century be self-medicating with nicotine. At that time, smoking in popular media was not intended to accurately portray the true quantity of real-world smoking. Instead it was used as a signal to the viewer either that this is a very stressful environment, or that the character is trying to relax. A notable exception is one scene from 1981's Body Heat. There was a will reading where pretty much everyone present started lighting up. When Ted Danson's character is offered a cigarette, he responds with "No thanks, I'll just breathe the air". It stuck with me all these years because it rang shockingly true. So that's pretty much how I remember the 70's. If anything, Mad Men is probably making an attempt to more accurately portray the prevalence of smoking at the time, and it looks shocking to you because you are more used to seeing smoking portrayed in the symbolic way that media has traditionally portrayed it. If they are going overboard, they aren't doing so nearly as much as movies traditionally have underplayed it. 

I suppose you could draw that comparison. However, I don't believe the respective folks responsible were looking at things that way. Falkenhayn's strategy at Verdun was, as you say, attrition. Since frontal attacks and breakthroughs on that front were just not succeeding, the idea was instead to weaken the enemy army by bleeding away as much of it as possible. In order to do that, he had to attack at a point the French would feel forced to defend, despite any losses. Hence the salient at Verdun. The objective was never to actually take it, but to whittle away at the enemy army. The German diversion to the Caucus oil fields by most accounts was due to Hitler's prioritizing of that objective over major Russian population centers. So it wasn't a purposeful strategy for Stalingrad, but a reflection of the fact that Stalingrad wasn't considered the top objective for them. Put simply, the war leadership of Nazi Germany had a tendency to value strategic resources over what many would consider traditional political objectives. Another good example of this came in April of 1940. Despite their imminent need to begin action in France before the allies could further mobilize, the Germans invaded Norway. The only real value of Norway to Germany was that it supplied them a lot of their iron. France was not invaded for another month. 

I think its fair to say in every case most of those people would have preferred to stay at home, but the powers-that-be in their homelands were making it impossible for them. And those are just the big ones that took a lot of "digestion" to deal with. There have been lots of smaller immigration surges from war-torn places like Khmer-run Cambodia, El Salvador (80's and 2014), Somalia (1990's), etc. 

I don't think this was done 100% on purpose, but that's roughly how Egypt ended up part of the British Empire. The ruler of Egypt in the mid-1800's was not very good with finances, to say the least. He ended up having to sell the Suez Canal to the British, and things continued to deteriorate to the point where the entire country was essentially put into receivership. This inevitably sparked an anti-European uprising, which in turn threatened the (largely British) financial interests to whom the country was in debt. That in turn got the British Navy and army sent to restore order. Again, the UK didn't start buying Egyptian assets and debt with the clever master plan of eventually taking over the country. However, the effect was certainly the same. 

Answering a question in the comments, there further was never an instance where faithless electors significanly altered the results of an election. In fact, it appears that electoral votes not being particularly close may be an inducement to faithless electors, as most incidents seem to be protest votes.* There was however one interesting incident of mass-faithlessness. In the 1872 election one of the major-party POTUS candidates, (apparently as a gift to us US history nuts) died after electors were chosen but before they could cast their votes. He'd only gotten 66 electors (nowhere enough to challenge U.S. Grant), but all but three ended up voting for other people. Under the circumstances, rather than tar those electors as "faithless", it may be right to look further askance at the 3 who remained faithful and voted for the dead guy. * - The "faithless elector" who voted for Reagan instead of Ford in 1976 did an interview on Ken Rudin's Political Junkie podcast #158, and admitted he would not have done so if the vote had been close. 

Basically, from south to north, you had pastoral Iranian tribes, then Slavs, then Finns. After a while (around the third century BCE), the easternmost German tribes (the Ostragoths) learned the pastoral lifestyle from the Iranians, and took over their territory in southern Russia. A bit later (370), Huns arrived from the east, and conquered the Ostragothic territory (along with the Ostragoths). That whole time, in the north the slavs slowly pushed the Finns north. There was generally communications between the eastern half of the Roman Empire and whomever held the southern Russia pastoral territory at the time, although sadly much of it was via warfare. The activity in the northern part is known to us only through archeology. It wasn't until Byzantine times that any kind of regular trade was established between Constantinople and northern Russia.
