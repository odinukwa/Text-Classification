The following results show that the notion of a critical point in a permutative LD-systems behaves nearly the same as the notion of a critical point in an algebra of elementary embeddings. 

The ideal $\{C\in\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)|x\not\in C\}$ is principal in $\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)$ if and only if $\uparrow x$ is clopen. The filter $\{C\in\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)|x\in C\}$ is principal in $\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)$ if and only if the set $\downarrow x$ is clopen. 

The proof of the above theorem is a straightforward generalization of the standard proof of the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem. The Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem also holds for other similar structures that are not as well known such as MV-algebras. In fact, this paper gives an abstract version of the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem that one can apply to structures such as $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebras and $MV$-algebras. 

Therefore, the set $\{Z(f)|f\in I\}$ is a filter on $\mathcal{B}$. If $A\in\mathcal{B}$, then since $\mathcal{M}/I$ is a field, and $(\chi_{A}+I)^{2}=\chi_{A}+I$, we have either $\chi_{A}+I=0$ or $\chi_{A}+I=1$. If $\chi_{A}+I=0$, then $\chi_{A}\in I$, so $A^{c}=Z(\chi_{A})\in\{Z(f)|f\in I\}$. On the other hand, if $\chi_{A}+I=1$, then $\chi_{A^{c}}=1-\chi_{A}\in I$, so $A=Z(\chi_{A^{c}})\in\{Z(f)|f\in I\}$. Therefore, the set $\{Z(f)|f\in I\}$ is an ultrafilter. Therefore let $\mathbf{Z}:Max(\mathcal{M})\rightarrow S(\mathcal{B})$ be the mapping where $\mathbf{Z}(I)=\{Z(f)|f\in I\}$ for maximal ideals $I$. We claim that the mappings $\mathbf{Z}$ and $V$ are inverses. Assume that $I$ is a maximal ideal in $\mathcal{M}$ and assume $f\in I$. Then $Z(f)\in \mathbf{Z}(I)=\{Z(f)|f\in I\}$ , so $f\in V(\mathbf{Z}(I))$. Therefore $I\subseteq V(\mathbf{Z}(I))$, so $V(\mathbf{Z}(I))=I$ by maximality. Now assume that $\mathcal{U}\in S(\mathcal{B})$ is an ultrafilter. Let $A\in\mathcal{U}$, and assume that $Z(f)=A$. Then $Z(f)=A\in\mathcal{U}$, so $f\in V(\mathcal{U})$. Therefore $A=Z(f)=\{Z(f)|f\in V(\mathcal{U})\}=\mathbf{Z}(V(\mathcal{U}))$. We conclude that $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbf{Z}(V(\mathcal{U}))$, so clearly $\mathcal{U}=\mathbf{Z}(V(\mathcal{U}))$. Therefore the functions $\mathbf{Z}:Max(\mathcal{M})\rightarrow S(\mathcal{B})$ and $V:S(\mathcal{B})\rightarrow Max(\mathcal{M})$ are inverses. Therefore the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the ultrafilters on $S(\mathcal{B})$. Furthermore, the maximal ideals extending $\mathcal{N}$ are clearly in a one-to-one correspondence with the ultrafilters that contain all sets of full measure. In particular, if $M\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is the ideal of sets of measure zero, then the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{N}$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the ultrafilters on the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}/M$. If we let $\mathcal{M}^{\sharp}$ denote the ring of bounded measurable functions in $\mathcal{M}$, then the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}^{\sharp}$ are also in a one-to-one correspondence with the ultrafilters in the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}$. To prove this correspondence, let's give the set $S$ the proximity where two sets are separated if and only if they are separated by a measurable set. In other words, $(S,\delta)$ becomes a proximity space where $A\not\delta B$ if and only if there is a measurable set $C$ such that $A\subseteq C,B\subseteq C^{c}$. It turns out that $\mathcal{M}^{\sharp}$ is the set of all bounded proximity maps from $(S,\delta)$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, if $X$ is the Smirnov compactification of the proximity space $(S,\delta)$, then the ring $\mathcal{M}^{\sharp}$ is isomorphic with the ring $C(X)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $X$. However, it is well known and it is easy to prove that the maximal ideals on $C(X)$ are simply the ideals of the form $\{f\in C(X)|f(x_{0})=0\}$ for some $x_{0}\in X$. Therefore the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}^{\sharp}\simeq C(X)$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the set $X$. However, in the paper Zero-Dimensional Proximities and Zero-Dimensional Compactifications, it is remarked that the Smirnov compactification $X$ is simply the space $S(\mathcal{B})$ of ultrafilters on $\mathcal{B}$. Therefore, the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}^{\sharp}$ are also in a one-to-one correspondence with $S(\mathcal{B})$. In my paper A Generalization of the Notion of a $P$-Space to Proximity Spaces I outlined this same exact proof of the correspondence between the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}^{\sharp}$ and $S(\mathcal{B})$. In other words, the sets $S(\mathcal{B}),Max(\mathcal{M}),Max(\mathcal{M}^{\sharp})$ are all in a one-to-one correspondence. 

Let $X$ be a set. Suppose that there exists an element $1\in X$ along with functions $L:X^{2}\rightarrow X,R:X^{2}\rightarrow X$ that satisfy the following identities: 

I recently gave a talk about how rank-into-rank cardinals and the cardinals around the $n$-huge level could be used to construct new public key cryptosystems. The basic idea is to select some finite subalgebra $(X,*)$ of the quotient algebra of rank-into-rank embeddings $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}/\equiv^{\gamma}$. Since $(X,*)$ is finite, the algebra $(X,*)$ is always computable. One then extrapolates from $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}/\equiv^{\gamma}$ a ternary self-distributive operation $t^{\bullet}$ on the set $X$. The operation $t^{\bullet}$ is typically of the form $t^{\bullet}(x,y)=T(x,y)*z$ for some operation $T$ that satisfies $x*T(y,z)=T(x*y,x*z)$. Then from the algebra $(X,t^{\bullet})$, one extrapolates a new algebra $(\Diamond(X,t^{\bullet}),t^{\sharp})$ ($t^{\sharp}$ is ternary) which I call a functional endomorphic Laver table. Functional endomorphic Laver tables may be used as platforms for several public key cryptosystems such as the Ko-Lee key exchange and the Kalka-Teicher key exchange. Since such cryptosystems are very new, nobody knows anything about the security of these cryptosystems or even about the efficiency of such cryptosystems (set theorists, get to work). However, if these cryptosystems are secure against classical computation, then these cryptosystems will likely remain secure against attacks from adversaries with quantum computers as well (quantum algorithms currently use very few specialized techniques that have nothing to do with large cardinals). Depending on how you count, there are about five other different kinds of public key cryptosystems which are not known to be vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. 

Of course, these images are unexpected since the Laver tables provide the only source of computer generated images of objects that arise in current set theory research. The images were generated by Mathematica and GAP and the second image was originally generated with the help of Jonathan Burns. 

Let $B$ be a basis for $K$ over $F$. Let $B^{*}$ denote the ultrapower $B^{X}/\mathcal{U}$. Then $F^{*}\subseteq B^{*}\subseteq K^{*}$. Since the statement "$B$ is linearly independent over $F$" is a conjunction of countably many first order statements, the set $B^{*}$ is also linearly independent. Therefore the degree of $[K^{*},F^{*}]$ is at least $B^{*}$. If your ultrafilter is $\sigma$-complete, then the sentence "$B$ is a basis" is a countably long first order sentence. Since Los' theorem holds for infinitary logic on $\sigma$-complete ultrafilters, the set $B^{*}$ is also a basis. Therefore, for $\sigma$-complete ultrafilter $[K^{*},F^{*}]=|B^{*}|$, so in this case, the problem is reduced to the cardinality of ultrapowers. In fact, the set $B^{*}$ is a basis if and only if $\mathcal{U}$ is $\sigma$-complete or $B$ is finite. If $\mathcal{U}$ is not $\sigma$-complete and $B$ is infinite, then let $b_{n}$ be a sequence of distinct elements in $B$ and let $A_{n}$ be a sequence of disjoint subsets of $X$ where $\bigcup_{n}A_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$, but $A_{n}\not\in\mathcal{U}$ for all $n$. Let $f:X\rightarrow K$ be a function where $f=b_{1}+...+b_{n}$ on $A_{n}$. Then $[f]\in K^{*}$, but $[f]$ is linearly independent from $B^{*}$.
