As a related question, one can ask how many of the irreducible characters have only real values. It is known that this is the same as the number of real conjugacy classes, where $[x]$ is said to be real iff it is the same as $[x^{-1}]$. Let $G$ be the alternating group on $n$ letters, let $S$ denote the corresponding symmetric group, and let $\epsilon\colon S\to\mathbb{Z}/2$ be the map with kernel $G$. If $x\in G$ then there is an obvious way (starting from a disjoint cycle decomposition) to construct $y\in S$ with $yxy^{-1}=x^{-1}$. If $m_i$ is the number of $i$-cycles in $x$ then it works out that $$ \epsilon(y) = \sum_im_i\lfloor i/2\rfloor = \sum_j (m_{4j+2}+m_{4j+3}). $$ If $\epsilon(y)=0$ then clearly $[x]$ is real. If $\epsilon(y)=1$ then $[x]$ is real iff there is an odd permutation $z$ that commutes with $x$ (so we can replace $y$ by $yz$). I think that this holds iff there is an even $i$ with $m_i>0$, or an odd $i$ with $m_i>1$. Thus, we see that $[x]$ is non-real iff it is a product of cycles of distinct odd lengths, an odd number of which are congruent to $3$ mod $4$. There will be many classes like this when $n$ is large, so there will be many non-real irreducible characters. It seems unlikely to me that each such character has only two non-real values, but I do not see a proof. Anyway, I hope that this analysis may at least shed some light on the original question. 

My Motivation:(Importance of frequency-uniform decomposition operator); It is well-known that $S(t)=e^{it\triangle}: L^{p}\to L^{p}$ if and only if $p=2.$ But the frequency-uniform decomposition has at least two advantages for the Shr\"odinger semi-group: (a) $\square_{k}e^{it\triangle}:L^{p'}\to L^{p}$ satisfies a uniform truncated decay, (b) $\square_{k}e^{it\triangle}$ is uniformly bounded on $L^{p}.$ Thanks, 

For a bounded complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R$, we define, its Fourier-Stieltjes transform, $\hat{\mu}(y)= \int_{\mathbb R} e^{-2\pi ix\cdot y} d\mu(x); (y\in \mathbb R).$ Let $1\leq p \leq \infty $ and we put, $$X_{p}= \{f\in L^{p}(\mathbb R)\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb R) :\hat{f}\in L^{p}(\mathbb R)\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb R)\};$$ and we consider the algebra of Fourier-Stieltjes transforms(functions of Fourier-Stieltjes transforms), namely, $$B(\mathbb R) = \{f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb C : \exists \ \text{bounded complex Borel measure} \ \mu \ \text{on} \ \mathbb R \ni \ \hat{\mu}= f \}.$$ For $p=1,$ clearly, by inversion formula, $X_{p} \subset B(\mathbb R).$ 

We put , $A^{q}(\mathbb T)= \{ f\in L^{q}(\mathbb T): \hat{f}\in \ell^{q}(\mathbb Z) \}.$ By Helson-Kahane-Katznelson-Rudin Theorem, it follows that, "Let $F$ be a function on $\mathbb C$ and if $F(f)\in A^{1}(\mathbb T)$ whenever $f\in A^{1}(\mathbb T)$($F(f)$ is the composition of $F$ and f)(i.e, $F$ operates in $A^{1}(\mathbb T)$), then $F$ must be real-analytic on $\mathbb R^{2}.$" 

Fix a prime $p\geq 5$ and an integer $n>0$. All spaces in this question are implicitly $p$-localized. Consider the spaces $X=J_{p^n-1}S^2$ (the $p^n-1$'th stage in the James construction $JS^2\simeq\Omega S^3$) and $Y=\Omega X$. These appear naturally in a number of applications. The loop sum operation makes $Y$ into an $H$-space. Is it known whether this is commutative? (Here and elsewhere, "commutative" means "commutative up to homotopy".) One basic idea is that the loop space of any $H$-space is a commutative $H$-space. However, it is standard that $H^*(X;\mathbb{Q})=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^{p^n})$, and it is easy to see that this does not admit any Hopf algebra structure, so $X$ is not an $H$-space. On the other hand, there is a James-Hopf map $h\colon JS^2\to JS^{2p^n}$. A well-known calculation in cohomology shows that $X$ is the fibre of $h$, so $Y$ is the fibre of $\Omega h$. The domain of $\Omega h$ is $\Omega JS^2\simeq\Omega^2S^3\simeq\Omega^3\mathbb{H}P^\infty$. The codomain is $\Omega JS^{2p^n}\simeq\Omega^2S^{2p^n+1}$. Here $S^{2p^n+1}$ is not a loop space, but it is an old theorem that it admits a commutative product (as does any odd-dimensional $p$-local sphere). Thus, the domain and codomain of $\Omega h$ have some extra commutativity to spare. On the other hand, $h$ is not a loop map, so $\Omega h$ is not obviously a double loop map, so it may be that the extra structure on the (co)domain cannot be brought into play. One can check that the map $H_*(Y;\mathbb{Z}/p)\to H_*(\Omega^2S^3;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is injective, and $H_*(\Omega^2S^3;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is commutative, so there is no obvious primary homological obstruction to commutativity of $Y$. There is a canonical map $JS^2\to\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ which is a rational equivalence. This restricts to give a rational equivalence $X\to\mathbb{C}P^{p^n-1}$, which in turn gives a rational equivalence $Y\to\Omega\mathbb{C}P^{p^n-1}$. Using the fibration $S^{2p^n-1}\to\mathbb{C}P^{p^n-1}\to\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ one can check that $Y$ is rationally equivalent to $\Omega S^{2p^n-1}\times S^1$ and thus to $K(\mathbb{Q},2p^n-2)\times K(\mathbb{Q},1)$. This has an obvious commutative product, and I think it works out that this is the only possible product up to homotopy. We therefore deduce that $Y_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is commutative, but I do not think that this approach gives useful information integrally. 

[The authors says it follows by the following two Lemmas 31 and 32: but I am unable to see how does it follows? My little effort, $p_{1}<p_{2}\implies M_{p_{1}, 1} \subset M_{p_{2},1}$; and so $\|\cdot\|_{M_{p_{2},1}} \lesssim \|\cdot\|_{M_{p_{1,1}}}$; so my confusion: if we have strong $M_{p_{2},1}$ solution how does it gives strong-$M_{p_{1},1}$ solution. Why the interval is SAME? How to use the following lemmas effectively? See also Remark 7 in the above paper(for getting the flavour how it is useful for global well posedness)] Lemma 31. Let $I$ be a bounded time interval containing $t_{0}$, let $p\in [1, \infty]$, and let $u\in C(I, M^{s}_{p,1})$ be a strong $M^{s}_{p,1}$ solution to NLKG. If the quantity $\|u\|_{L_{t}^{k} (I, M^{s}_{\infty,1})}$ is finite, then one has\ $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I, M^{s}_{p,1})} \lesssim C(|I|) \left( \|u(t_{0}\|_{M^{s}_{p,1}} +\|u_{t}(t_{0}\|_{M^{s-1}_{p,1}} \right) \exp \left( \int_{I} C(|I| \|u(\tau)\|^{k}_{M^{s}_{\infty,1}} d\tau \right)$\ where $C(|I|)$ is some positive constant associated with the length of $I.$ [For the proof see the above paper, page no. 11; it is simple and follows as an application of Gronwall inequality] Lemma 32. Let $I$ be a bounded time interval containing $t_{0}$, let $p\in [1, \infty]$, and let $u\in C(I, M^{s}_{\infty,1})$ be a strong $M^{s}_{\infty,1}$ solution to NLKG. If the quantity $\|u\|_{L_{t}^{k} (I, M^{0}_{\infty,1})}$ is finite, then one has\ $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I, M^{s}_{p,1})} \lesssim C(|I|) \left( \|u(t_{0}\|_{M^{s}_{\infty,1}} +\|u_{t}(t_{0}\|_{M^{s-1}_{\infty,1}} \right) \exp \left( \int_{I} C(|I| \|u(\tau)\|^{k}_{M^{0}_{\infty,1}} d\tau \right)$\ where $C(|I|)$ is some positive constant associated with the length of $I.$ [For the proof see the above paper see, page no. 11] EDIT: [In what follows I am trying to figure out the answer in line of comments given below by Willie Wong.] I used the Theorem 1 (local well posedness) from the same paper). Let $I_{1}$ be compact interval containing $t_{0}$ and $u(t_{0})\in M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1},1}$, and $u_{t}(t_{0})\in M^{s_{1}-1}_{p_{1},1}$; and therefore by Theorem 1, it follows that, $u$ is a strong $M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1}, 1}$ solution to NLKG, in the sense that, $u\in C(I_{1}, M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1},1}) \cap C^{1}(I_{1}, M^{s_{1}-1}_{p_{1},1}).$ And now as an application of Lemma 31; we get, $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I_{1}, M^{s}_{p_{1},1})} \lesssim C(|I_{1}|) \left( \|u(t_{0}\|_{M^{s}_{p_{1},1}} +\|u_{t}(t_{0}\|_{M^{s-1}_{p_{1},1}} \right) \exp \left( \int_{I} C(|I_{1}| \|u(\tau)\|^{k}_{M^{s}_{\infty,1}} d\tau \right);$\ as you have pointed out: since $M^{p_{2},1}\subset M^{\infty, 1};$ it follows that, $\|u(t)\|_{M_{\infty,1}} \leq \|u(t)\|_{M_{p_{2,1}}};$ and so $\|u\|_{L^{\infty}(I_{1}, M_{\infty, 1})} \leq \|u\|_{L^{\infty}(I_{1}, M_{p_{2},1})}$ (is finite by hypothesis of Theorem 6, since $I_{1}$ is compact). And therefore $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I_{1}, M^{s}_{p_{1},1})} < \infty.$ 

$W$ detects orthogonality iff it spans. Indeed, $T$ preserves inner products on $W$ iff we have $\langle Ta,Tb\rangle=\langle a,b\rangle$ for all $a,b\in W$, and this is equivalent to $\langle a,(T^*T-I)b\rangle=0$. If we fix $u$ then $\{v:\langle u,(T^*T-I)v\rangle=0\}$ is certainly a vector subspace. Similarly, if we fix $v$ then $\{u:\langle u,(T^*T-I)v\rangle=0\}$ is a vector subspace. Using this, we see that if $W$ spans, then $\langle u,(T^*T-I)v\rangle=0$ for all $u,v\in X$, so $\langle Tu,Tv\rangle=\langle u,v\rangle$, so $T$ is orthogonal. The converse is Alex R.'s comment. It follows that the minimum cardinality is $n$. 

Here is an argument that is essentially the same as Oscar's, but organized a little differently. First, we have a fibration $S^3\to X\to\Sigma$, giving an exact sequence $$ \pi_2(\Sigma) \to \pi_1(S^3)=0 \to \pi_1(X)\xrightarrow{\pi_*}\pi_1(\Sigma) \to \pi_0(S^3) = 0, $$ which proves that $\pi_*$ is an isomorphism. Next put $G=\pi_1(\Sigma)$ and let $U$ be the universal cover of $\Sigma$, so that $\Sigma=U/G$. For any connected based space $Z$, there is a natural map $$ \alpha_Z\colon [Z,\Sigma] \to \text{Hom}(\pi_1(Z),G)/\text{conjugacy}. $$ (We have to take the conjugacy quotient because we are considering unbased homotopy classes of unbased maps.) It is standard that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$ and so is contractible. Using this, covering theory proves that $\alpha_Z$ is always bijective. By taking $Z=\Sigma$ or $Z=X$, we deduce that the map $$\pi^*\colon[\Sigma,\Sigma]\to[X,\Sigma]$$ is bijective. It follows that every map $X\to\Sigma$ is homotopic to one that factors through $\pi$, as required. 

Is it true that to study wave equation is equivalent to study the multiplier $e^{it |\xi|}$ ($f\mapsto (e^{i t |\xi|}\hat{f})^{\vee}$)? ( I don't see why this multiplier cover both the term in the solution. Can we deduce some thing about the multiplier $\cos t |\xi|$ and $\frac{\sin t |\xi|}{|\xi|}$ Background: I am familiar with the following solution to the wave equation: $u(x,t)= f\ast \partial_t W_t(x) + g\ast W_t (x),$ where $W_t = [ \frac{ \sin 2\pi t |\xi|}{ 2\pi |\xi|}]^{\vee}.$ (But here I do not see any square root sign; I guess, there must some thing to do with square root sign ....) 

We put, $M(\mathbb R)= $The set of bounded complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R$ and for $\mu \in M(\mathbb R)$, we define $||\mu||:= |\mu| (\mathbb R) = \text {total variation of } \ \mu $; and $$B(\mathbb R) := \{f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb C : \exists \ \mu \in M(\mathbb R) \ \text {such that} \ f(y) = \hat{\mu}(y) \};$$ where, $\hat{\mu}(y)= \int_{\mathbb R} e^{-iyx} d\mu(y),$ and for $f\in B(\mathbb R)$, we define $$||f||=||\hat{\mu}||:= ||\mu||.$$ My Question : Put, $\mathbb T:= \{z\in \mathbb C : |z|=1 \}$ and suppose $f$ is function on the circle $\mathbb T$ and its Fourier series is absolutely convergent, that is, $\sum_{n\in \mathbb Z}|\hat{f}(n)|< \infty$; where, $\hat{f}(n)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) e^{-int} dt, \ (n\in \mathbb Z)$; , and it satisfies the property $f(e^{i\theta})=0$ for $\pi-\delta \leq \theta \leq \pi + \delta $; ($0<\delta < \pi $). Define $F:\mathbb R \to \mathbb C$ such that $$F(x):= f(e^{ix})$$ for every $x\in \mathbb R$.
