Don’t ever make the mistake of over-estimating dermatologists. ;-) And in fact, acne is a very bad example because treating it is a bit like voodoo. The last resort cure for acne (isotretinoin) is an extremely potent toxin that kills cells left, right and center. And hopefully it eradicates acne in the process. It often has side-effects (some quite severe) and leads to a very high chance of birth defects when given to a pregnant woman. And finally, it doesn’t always work. There is nothing sophisticated about that drug and it can only be taken because most its side-effects concern the skin, which regrowths rather easily. But it should be obvious why similar medication isn’t used on the brain. ;-) The brain as an organ is much more complex and requires much more sophisticated treatment, lest it be permanently damaged. That doesn’t mean that neurology isn’t a science – it just means that it needs to be much more sophisticated. 

It’s worth pointing out that the report is uncharacteristically clear and drastic. No allowance is made for reasonable doubt. It’s also worth noting that the source cited in the question disqualifies itself with its name-calling, scientific ignorance (such as reference to “the mysterious SIDS” – there’s nothing at all mysterious about it) and by its routine use of Godwin’s law. 

the list goes on. The claim is so trivially wrong and, quite frankly, ridiculous that I can’t help wondering in what context it was used.

Yes, this is a trick. There’s a video on YouTube from the Skeptic Zone Podcast demonstrating how it’s done. Essentially, the lady tricked you – she didn’t always apply the same kind of pressure, she changed the vector of the applied force slightly. This allows her to apply an equal amount of pressure but without the same effect. 

While they themselves give the caveats “small-scale” and “qualitative” and don’t seem to consider other, more conventional markers such as grades and rates of conversion to higher education, this looks like it might be a valid conclusion. However, the report doesn’t provide an itemisation of the cited studies (which, by the way, is inexcusable). A lot of the evidence seems to have been collected in a monograph [1]. Unfortunately I’m unable to check this out myself since I couldn’t obtain access to it online. 

In fact, the acquisition of resistance to anticancer treatment by tumours is a very well-known and unfortunate side-effect. For a newspaper to claim that this is a “surprising” new finding is nothing short of ignorant. References 

Other research [2,3,4] had similar findings. In fact, the pesticide may be enough in producing colony collapse disorder even without the presence of a pathogen, merely by affecting their nervous system, as suggested by Lu & al. [2]: 

The cruelty and perversion of these experiments can hardly be overstated. Since similar experimentation on live humans is fundamentally unethical, not much of his “research” can ever be repeated. Ironically, this means that this situation did present a unique opportunity to perform potentially valuable experiments. For instance, he could unscrupulously perform dissections on intact dead bodies and did a lot of twin studies: 

I want to conclude by saying that all this is well-known and not particularly new (although the amylase study is). Creationists who claim this hasn’t been observed and in particular Answers in Genesis are lying. They are not only ignorant, they are intentionally dishonest and deceptive. It’s as simple as that. 

No, the picture is not accurate. No, “42% of yearly deaths in the world” are not from abortion. As Avi’s answer shows, the raw numbers are about right, albeit with a big uncertainty attached. However, the percentages are wrong because the 42% implies that the “total number of deaths” = “number of deaths after birth” + “number of abortions”. This is inaccurate. There is at least one additional factor: As many as 50% of all pregnancies are miscarried before coming to full term – most (about 60%) due to chromosomal aberrations. If we count pre-birth deaths in our statistic, then we also need to count those miscarriages. According to the CIA World Factbook, the birth rate in 2012 was 19.15 per 1000, that’s 135.97 million births, and consequently about 135.97 million miscarriages. If we add the numbers, we find that abortions account for 20% yearly deaths in the world, not 42% as claimed (and this isn’t even accounting for the fact that of those 20%, some would have miscarried anyway). Of course this is assuming that we count prenatal deaths as “deaths” at all, and as can be seen from the statistics on mortality rate, this is not normally done. The most we can honestly say is that “there are 0.72 as many abortions as there are (postnatal) deaths (= 72%)”. But presenting these 42% as part of the overall deaths is wrong, as I’ve shown above. In statistics, presentation matters. Here’s a summary: 

A 2004 report linked on the NEA’s teacher diversity website lists the evidence that supports that teacher diversity does indeed impact on closing the achievement gap. In particular, they highlight that 

But Darwin was not certain (and even if he personally believed it, I need to stress that he was not certain) that there was only one common ancestor. All he was certain about is captured in these famous words: 

[Daily Mail and Huffington Post both published the same, word for word, and neither acknowledges the other as source. But that’s just an aside.] This sounds like very bad news indeed. Is there any truth to it? 

We don’t know. Wikipedia has an interesting break-down of the discussion which seems to be quite solid with a lot of references to actual studies. The salient point is this: 

Well … no. There are a lot of things in the natural environment that can and do cause cancers. The most glaring point is natural sources of high radiation, such as uranium ore and of course the sun. But more sources exist, such as viruses, infectious diseases and diet. 

So Ian Plimer arrives at his assertion by comparing two different numbers: the number of overall increase in CO2 in the atmosphere (110 ppm), and a relative percentage of the atmospheric concentration (0.039 ppm), and alleges that these numbers are the same. That’s like saying that 10$ and 10% of 10$ (= 1$) are identical. 

life expectancy has increased drastically since ancient Egypt and that cancer prevalence increases with age. 

Notice the “into a few forms”. The idea that there might have been just one appears rather as an afterthought. Now, in the meantime we know that there was only a single common ancestor due to the universality of the genetic code. But this evidence emerged long after Darwin’s death.
