Listen to your wife. She seems like a wise woman. Almost certainly, this idiot of a former boss doesn't even remember this year old promise. While it may be weighing on your mind, I'd be willing to bet that he hasn't thought about this even once. And in the unlikely event he does contact you about getting his "free lunch", just make excuses about your availability until he gets the hint and goes away. It's been a year. Let it go and move on. 

As you have experienced, different companies and different managers have different cultures. Each has different expectations regarding the levels of communication and feedback required. The key to correctly gauging requirements is communication. Talk to your boss. Ask about status reports, feedback, etc. And when a situation occurs that you suspect might require a different level of feedback - ask! Ask your boss how much and how often and in what manner she/he would like to be updated. Talk with your co-workers. Ask them what is the expected level of communication. Note how they do it, and ask about what you are seeing. A lot of work success involves communication. Communicating well with your boss will take you a long way toward work success. 

You need to talk with HR - now. You must explain how these statements are false. You need to ask about this investigation - what you need to do in order to get it concluded quickly, and what are your rights. And you should talk with HR about how this is affecting your relationship with your coworkers. Good HR folks are trained to listen and understand. Hopefully this will guide them to a swift conclusion of the investigation - in your favor - and a quick resumption of good relationships with your coworkers. Do it now - don't wait. [As @WesleyLong wisely points out - DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. Every communication, every meeting, every hallway conversation. Write it down: When and where, who was there, what was said to you, what you said to them.] 

I don't know what country you are in, but where I live engineers are responsible for what they deliver. So if someone dies because I deliver faulty products or knowingly allow faulty products to be delivered, then I go to prison. Ditto if actively lying or conniving in lying about what your products can do, or whatever, you, yes you yourself, are guilty of fraud. As it says further down, if it's a lie, preface it by "my boss says". Never sign off code or test reports if you don't like it. Never. Better still, find an excuse not to present this stuff to the customer. But firstly, get a new job and get out of there, don't wait another day. And find an alternative exit route in case of fire. And, oh yes, if there is a fire and people die because you didn't report the chained-up fire exit, then you too are at fault. I see below you reported it in a roundabout way, but do it in writing. Mail your boss and his boss that this is illegal and dangerous. Do it right now. This is not a joke, these are people's lives. 

They cannot prevent you from drinking, of course, but they can forbid it. I had a mate once who worked for a big US company based in Utah. It said in his contract that he was not allowed to drink alcohol, at any time, ever. He signed the contract, and worked for them for a long time. It just meant he and many of his colleagues did not drink alcohol if there were any US personnel around (business trips, socialising) but made up for it by drinking in private. I never heard of them being tested. There was the (possibly apocryphal) story of an alcoholic who injected vodka into oranges so he could eat them at his desk to keep topped up during the day. 

Go ahead and follow up when you said you would. Also acknowledge that you realize the date has been extended and they may not be as far along in the process as they would have been without the extension. This way you honor our commitment, but also show that you are keeping up with the process and are aware of ongoing changes. 

Most HR systems today use some form of Applicant Tracking System. Cover letters do not get processed in the same way as the resume/CV, so vital information that is only on the cover letter might not be used to qualify you for the position, or it might not be seen by the decision makers (it will be available to be seen, but that is not the same as being seen). As a candidate, you have to assume that the people initially reviewing your application have many resumes/CVs to get through in a short amount of time. If you make their job easier, you move the odds in your favor. If you make their job harder (by spreading important information across multiple documents instead of consolidating it into one - your CV) you lower your odds of getting through the process. So, to your question, if it is vital, put it in the CV and use the cover letter to call attention to it. 

Simple answer: Yes. Why are you looking for people in their early 20's? It seems you should be looking for people that can do a particular job at a particular level of skill and quality. If they can do the job, what difference does age make? If they cannot do the job, what difference does age make? Hire based on their skills and abilities. 

Yes, actually, but not in writing, do it in person and off-site if you can. I have done this; I transferred department to get away from the swine, and after a reorganisation he got assigned to us. So I left, officially to get some more varied experience. The boss said, what is the real reason? And I said, because I never want to be in the same room as X ever again. And he said, there's something wrong here, four of you are leaving to get away from this guy. I told him some of the nasty stuff X had done to me and many others, trying to keep it light-hearted and zippy. Last time I went past, I saw X had been downgraded and had to share an office (this is as low as it gets here). So it helped. It made me feel better too. 

The foul smelling part is flammable. Light a candle or one of those room-scenters with a candle inside. Or one of those tea warmers with a candle inside. Works really well in the bathroom too, if you have a big party and lots of people using it. 

Eating together is not only a perk, the company wants you to socialize and even (shock) continue to talk about work. So it may not be a requirement but nice if you can make it, and if you are not there you may miss something special. How about: 

A family member is a candidate for a contract position. The position requires a background check, including fingerprints (this information was just shared). The concern is that the prints will be digitized. With biometric authentication becoming more commonplace, that digital biometric data is more important (you can change a password that's been compromised, but you cannot change your fingerprints or retina patterns). Can anyone provide insight into how this is done currently? (Many years ago I was fingerprinted for a couple of jobs, but it was ink on a card that went into a file cabinet and was never actually sent anywhere). The major concern is the security of the biometric data. 

I would dress as if I were a new candidate interviewing for the first time. You are trying to transition from contracting to a permanent employee, and to transition into a new department. Dressing for the interview can set a mood and demonstrate that you are not making assumptions about your prospects based on personal familiarity. You know the office, so you know what everyone normally wears. I would dress at least as well as the normal office dress of the person who will be conducting the interview, probably a notch above. If they are interviewing outside candidates, they may change their normal dress for interview days. 

Find a way to keep their attention during this transition. If you stop talking and bury your head in your laptop, the audience will fill that time with something. If on the other hands, you use that time to ask the audience a question, give them a thought experiment, or find some other way to engage them while you are making your technical transition, you are more likely to keep their attention. This will require practice and may require a change in software or hardware,or even assistance from a team member, but it is primarily a presentation technique. 

Depends where you are. Here in Germany an e-mail is an official document, so the footer contains: My name, position and department, the post address, various telephone numbers and website. Then a baby logo Then it contains the official stuff; the registered office, district court, managing directors, etc. This part is mandated by law and is not negotiable. Then a note about confidentiality. On the other hand we don't have any header at all. You could persuade them to do without the opulent bit at the top. You can see all that in Outlook or whatever anyway. 

I am the only Brit around, so I do a lot of this. You have to be tactful; Oh dear, there are some typos in here, would you like me to have a look? It seems to work, they keep coming back. I have been doing this for so long that it is almost my second job. I keep a dictionary and a grammatical guide and a thesaurus here and show them the problem, and say a lot of Brits get this one wrong too. It's got a lot better since spell-checkers arrived. When I write something important in German I ask someone to proof-read it for me, and say; I'll do the same for you sometime. As a matter of fact it can be a bind if the students want me to proof-read their dissertations, but if it's too long I just do the first chapter and tell them to extrapolate. 

Require that you leave and submit your resume and application online. Ask you to submit an application through an in-store kiosk. Ask you to take a test at an in-store kiosk. Based on your score, the store manager may talk to you. 

Resumes and background checks are not the same thing. Your resume is a marketing tool, and as such, you choose what best represents the skills you are selling. Information provided for a background check is expected to be more thorough and is not about your skills. I have never known of anyone losing a job because they left something off a resume. I have known of people losing a job due to failure to disclose information for a background check. It was not for a failing to list a job, it was failure to list a minor ticket. But the issue was never about the thing that was left off, the issue was about the fact that the candidate was not honest. 

You might consider declining the job (and the test). I would not want to have a positive drug test in my history. I know that confidentiality rules should prevent any one from learning the results (other than those in the specific chain that are expected to learn the results). But information has a way of spreading. Could someone at this company talk to someone at another company and jeopardize your chances there (not legal, but if they aren't caught, how would you know)? If I thought there was a possibility that I would legitimately fail a test, I would not take it. There will of course be consequences for this job, but it would end there. You don't have to disclose your reason for withdrawing from consideration, so rumors of drug use would not follow you beyond this point.
