Fire resistance; fastest way to level a field is to torch it. However that doesn't touch the roots and in the after math the quickest growing plants able to sprout again from just the root (like many grasses) will sprout up first and push out the slower growers. Other naive methods of trying to eradicate them is cutting it all down. Again a fast growing plant that can sprout from roots will dominate the field quickly after. For increased unwanted spreading of the plant you can make the seeds survive in the digestive tract and sprout from the droppings of herbivores in the manure pile. They also seem like a tasty additive for cat and dog food though again viable seeds will pass through intact. Local wildlife can also partake in the spread. Before long local fields, woods and backyards will start sprouting the plant, signaling the start of the burning/chopping and weedkiller. 

A fire/blast resistant epidermis would be enough. An animal sensing a blast would huddle down protecting the more vulnerable parts, hold their breath and wait it out. Afterwards they could stop-drop-an-roll to put out the embers in the fur or throw dust on themselves to put them out. However the biggest change would be the possibility for animals to stop eating for energy. They would still need to eat to grow (and heal) but not for energy. But instead use internal oxidation of the hydrogen in the air they breath (same would go for the plants). All in all a fauna with a very low carbon foot-print. 

Maybe Yes Man running on water has been the subject of several scientific papers. In particular Google for papers by J. W. Glasheen and T. A. McMahon. They studied the basilisk lizard, but their results can be extrapolated to humans. It's debatable how reliable such a large extrapolation is, but the result is that the required speed is so far beyond human ability that we can safely conclude it's impossible without some artificial aid. There's a summary of the results from the papers in this article and a more general summary here. The conclusions are that you have to run at a speed of 30m/sec, almost 3 times as fast as Usain Blot (10.4 m/sec). Which doesn't sound too bad, but you'd need to generate a mechanical power of 12kW to do it. Trained athletes can just about manage half a kW, and most of us would struggle to generate 200W. If you generate 12kW, you would probably be roasted from within. You can reduce this by having wider feet, webbed feet, stronger muscles, some way to dissipating heat, the most ideal way would be to reduce its height and weight. Even then it would hard for a being to keep it up for a more than a few seconds time. 

Flapping wing designs are what came first in our history but they didn't work because too high gravity and too thin atmosphere for the weight of the craft. So in a world with thicker atmosphere and/or lighter gravity and perhaps lighter materials to build them out of, an ornithopter will work and be used until people discover the efficiency of the fixed wing+propeller. 

There is still a danger. When a vehicle veers off the road into a pole they will hit at 70 mph + 70 mph = 140 mph. Also merging in will be a problem. Relative to the static structures the cars on the belt will be going the 140 while those merging in will come on the belt at 70 (accelerated under their own power). A collision between those two will be a 70 mph collision. They will need to be separated until the speed difference is low. Then consider traffic jams. The belt will force the cars ahead which is a problem when there just isn't space where they want to go. That's a pileup waiting to happen. Actually getting on and off will probably be by first accelerating to 70 mph on a static road then coasting onto a new lane with the belt at 70mph and then accelerating again to 70 mph before merging into the main stream. 

Naturally NO, Once a object is sufficiently large enough (300 km, 511 Davida), given enough time, the gravitational forces will optimize the shape to make it spherical. Most objects are slightly ellipsoid, to balance out its rotation. There are a few hypothetical objects like a neutron star spinning at a very high speed, causing it be ellipsoid, elongated, almost like an egg. Artificial/Man-made objects can be square, this would also include stars, planets, and satellites. For a species to achieve this it has to be above Kardashev scale 2.0. You can manipulate electromagnetism to create a thin layer of plasma around an object and force it to conform to that shape, or perhaps use swarms of nanobots made of carbon tubes to create a artificially box, similar to what @Durakken mentioned. But science of any of this artificial structures is beyond the scope of my imagination. 

I will assume that there exists a centralized semi-autocratic government which can enforce all these ideas, at the cost few civil liberties, and has sufficient basic resources. The best possible situation is when you see humans as resources to optimize and invest in. Cities and Buildings City designs and building designs would be completely different, most building would consist of both residential, retail, entertainment, school/university and work. Most people will work, reside and be capable of living in the same building drastically reducing travel time. All buildings would conserve space, resources and be utilitarian, rather than a status symbol. Even things inside the houses would be utilitarian all costly decorative things would be discouraged. Some devices or objects would communal for maximum efficiency and usage. Travel Cars/Vehicles would be fully automated, the reason it is hard to make a self driving car is that AI has to compensate for human errors. By enforcing mandatory automated vehicles, you can bypass the problem increasing efficiency and speed. Air Travel would be very limited, a rare luxury, same for Cruises, and any form of recreational vacations. Most transport vehicles/ships used for inter-city trade would be limited to essential raw materials. Any objects which adds to transport would a luxury, this includes but not limited to artisan products, crops/plants/animals which do not get cultivated locally, ornamental objects. Energy We currently have technology to make 100% safe nuclear reactors with no radiation leakage, which automatically shuts down to avert possible catastrophe, without the stigma associated most of energy will come from nuclear with some renewable. Centralized energy efficiency would lead to automated factories shutting down at evening to accommodate the increase in usage due to people returning homes. Energy intensive systems would work nights and afternoons. Unused public lights, house lights would automatically and if necessary remotely shut down. Refrigerators, ACs, heater would be forced to run at limited near optimal range of temperatures. Computer Computers will always be connected to decentralized system which will be used to spy, delegate excess computational capabilities, information from people will be used help them psychological and used to assign optimal jobs. Blockchain and other better technology will be used to optimize all possible resources. Centralized education to enforce ideas and culture of conservation. Others Standardized components, limited choice, mass producible objects, a system similar to decentralized communism. Having a hobby would become a luxury. Outdoor entertainment would be replaced by online games. Guns, weapons and military would be limited to bare essentials. Religion would be non existent, or be forced to spread the values of optimization and cooperativeness. Spying would allow easy detection crime and fraud. Even forcing only genetically better hand picked in-vitro babies. Democracy and free media would be banned/restricted as it starts propaganda warfare, all jobs/positions would be merit based. There would be a lot cultural changes forced upon people. 

You need at least half a moon cycle between the two events if they involve the same moon; lunar eclipse can only occur during the full moon and a solar eclipse only during a new moon. Unless of course your world has more than one moon. 

If you allow the output to be . What you have is essentially a Hyper-Computer. The device that most closely matches your setup is a Zeno machine. After 1 ns you have either the result of the computation or it's already "crashed". This stands above the Turing machine in the computational hierarchy and bypasses the Halting problem entirely. The result of having such a machine available means that all computational tasks that you can think of will be able to be solved as fast as you can port them to the machines language and transfer them in. This means that is the NSA has access to it then they don't need to insert vulnerabilities in crypto standards. As most encrypted data can be decrypted. The One-Time pad will remain safe however. 

Big no is anything that can fly into your face/eyes and obscure your vision. So popular hairstyles will not be just letting it down (unless they are relaxing in a safe location). Instead buns and braids will be the order of the day. In undercover operations (fancy parties and such) you have an excuse for elaborate up-dos.
