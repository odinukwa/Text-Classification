Just be careful of ruts on descents -- the narrower the tire, the more easily a rut will swallow a tire and prevent you from turning. When ascending on narrow tires over gravel and uneven ground, gear down and pedal continuously so that you always have a low level of power to move your front wheel. When there are sandy patches, plan turns so that you can do as much of your turning on packed earth, keep turns over sand as shallow as possible, and if the sand is deep avoid turning altogether. 

For a civil suit you need to show that you were somehow adversely affected by her actions. If there was any damage to the bike, you could probably go after her for the cost of repairs. 

Bilenkey is a framebuilder who has been in Philly for ages, and probably knows about the local clubs and routes. His shop isn't very central. The Philly Bike Expo is in two months, and might be a good place to check out the cycling scene. 

Mountain bikes can be ridden with back and neck straight but they're designed for people who ride with a slight forward tilt, and they're not efficient on roads. Many European city bikes are similar to US Comfort bikes, and others like Dutch cargo bikes are designed with carrying capacity in mind. They're good for riding wearing everyday clothes at a pace that isn't going to get you all sweaty, but are no good for recreational riding with people on faster bikes. Touring bikes cannot as they have similar geometry to road/cross bikes. As explained above, recumbents come in vastly different geometries, but many do allow the kind of riding posture you describe. 

You didn't say much about the bike. If it's a carbon frame, or has a carbon fork, or a carbon seat post, you should not ride on it until you've ruled out any hairline fractures. Steel and aluminum bend before they break, but carbon tends to fail catastrophically which could lead to the frame falling apart underneath you. For a rear collision, you definitely want to check the chain-line through the rear derailleur to see if the hanger is bent, but if you're using indexed shifters the problem may just be the indexing is off. You can easily check whether the new cassette has different gear ratios than the old one by looking at the cassettes side by side. 

I've done this. Pick yourself up, and declare that you meant to do it. Ride off pouting. Realize your wheel is now out of true. Stop. True it enough with the wrong size nipple wrench until it stop scraping against the fenders. Ride off pouting again. 

If it's someone else's property, like a car or a mailbox, and there's damage, leave a note with your contact info. As Johannes points out, in some jurisdictions, a note might not be enough. You might be assumed to have fled if you don't make an attempt to contact the owner or file a report with the police. 

White lightning in particular is a waxy lube, not an oil based lube. The idea is that as dirt gets embedded in the lube, the wax flakes off instead of trapping the dirt particles and leaving them in a position to work themselves in between the plates of the chain. Most other lubes are oil based, so they don't have this property. I don't have much personal experience with wax based lubes so I can't comment, but I have met cyclo-tourists who carried a block of paraffin wax which they melted and dipped their chains in every night as part of their regular maintenance. This never seemed to be a maintenance savings to me. 

You route the cable/hose to the lever on one side of your bars instead of the other. Maybe you have to swap mismatched levers from one side of the bars to the other. Either way, it's a trivial change. Get a new mechanic. 

I live the next state over and have never ridden in Philly but here are a few indirect pointers. Drexel University and U Penn are in the middle of the city, so you might ask their student run clubs. 

Unfortunately, last years uglifying tricks can become next year's hipster appeal so don't just focus on making it ugly. Focus on making it harder to sell. Changing the look of your frame won't stop people stealing it to sell the components, so you need to first make sure it's not obvious which of your components are top-of-the-line. Duct tape over "Dura-Ace" can help here and placed properly won't stop the components from functioning. This won't fool a close inspection, but it will prevent "window shopping". A bike thief knows that his buyer wants to be able to plausibly deny that he knew he was receiving stolen goods. Once you've obfuscated your components, anything you can do to make that harder to plausibly deny, reduces the value to a thief. If you have some flexible stencils or sticky letters, you can always put "Property of [your name] at [your street number]" and "Not for sale" on the top tube. 

Rivendell bikes argues that most road bikes sold are too small. They're probably in the minority opinion as far as bike shops go, but they have (collectively) a lot of experience in frame geometry and riding styles. Their argument is based on their belief that most shops assume that road riders should emulate racers -- experts who are willing to put up with a lot of discomfort to gain small efficiencies -- and that this alienates a lot of casual riders, commuters, and tourists who would be better served by a bike that fits comfortably. 

A lot of recumbents, including the Cruzbike Sofrider pictured below, allow you to ride in the same kind of seated position you do in an office chair, and the ones that have high bars (instead of having the handle bars under the seat) allow you to mount rear view mirrors so that you needn't turn your neck to look backwards. Recumbents are lower to the ground than upright bikes, which makes them a fast efficient alternative to "comfort bikes", though it also makes them harder to use than a road bike for fast city riding in dense traffic since you can't stand up to see over cars. 

SOMA makes good quality affordable frames and their ES comes in 66cm. I'm only 6'4 but long in the limbs and I rode that on an extended tour just fine. The frame will probably set you back $400 or so which should leave room to kit it out. 

Stiffness is important when you have long tubes as in a tandem or elongated recumbent and your frame is made of a flexible material like steel. The frame can flex, especially with the pedalling of a strong or heavy rider which can lead to metal fatigue over time and can be disconcerting to the captain. For upright singles it's a non-issue. 

SunTour's silver shifters have the selectable "friction mode" that Angelo mentions. Of direct relevance to the OP, that page also notes there are some compatibility issues 

Pedestrians (though not sprinters), wheelchairs, and pedestrians using walkers are statically stable, while cyclists are dynamically stable (with the exception of some fixie freaks). 

In many places, the cyclist is probably at fault since there are no highways for bikes where the pedestrian isn't assumed to have right-of-way. Ask for contact info, and offer assistance if the cyclist is injured. If the cyclist leaves the scene without stopping, remember details (what the cyclist looked like and was wearing, their frame color and design), and file a police report. 

Yes. If you put slightly wider tires then you can do packed earth or even gravel without too much trouble. Even 25 or 28mm tires give a lot of advantage over 18 or 23mm wide tires. I did Col du Parpaillon on 25's. 

Since White lightning is not a grease, using a degreaser is probably not necessary except when you switch from an oil based lube to a wax one. When you buy a new chain, it comes greased, but that grease should be clean of grit. If you don't keep reapplying white lightning as often as recommended or the chain looks visibly dirty, then you're running the chain effectively without any lube or grit protection, so you should clean fully before reapplying. 

I wouldn't go with that color. They have others which are more reflective to headlights, and sell a bright yellow raincover. 

A wide range of gears on the rear is 11 T to 34 T which lets you vary your mechanical advantage by about 310% on a bike with only a rear derailleur. The front derailleur is (compared to the rear derailleur) a simple piece of equipment that greatly increases your ability to go fast on the flats while climbing comfortably. Adding a front crankset that goes from 24 T to 52 T lets you vary your mechanical advantage by ((52/11) / (24/34)) or 670% with both derailleurs between large-front/small-rear and small-front/large-rear. (The actual mechanical advantage has to take into account the ratio between the pedal circle circumference and the drive-wheel circumference, but I'm dividing mechanical advantages here so that constant divides out.) Bikes with only a front derailleur aren't made today because they don't pick up the slack in the chain, though I've heard that early model chained bikes were often ridden with slack chains. 

I've had bikes stolen in SF too and it sucks. Get some reusable zip ties, and zip tie your bike to the rack. That way, a thief has to also come up with a plausible reason why they disabled your locking mechanism to get at your bike, and you have a bit more time to get out of the bus and after them. On proceeding in this case, "How to Sue Someone Who Stole Your Stuff" suggests you may be able to pursue civil penalties: 

Since pedestrians often assume that others can stop on a dime, they make sudden directional changes without thinking about what's around them. Mixing pedestrians and cyclists on narrow sidewalks where cyclists can't reroute is a recipe for collisions. 

Same as in a car/car collision. Stop, render assistance and give a report to any responding officer if either party is injured or thinks a report is necessary. 

Peter White has done a lot of testing of dynamo headlights and has even put together comparisons of luminance. I have the Schmidt Edelux and love it. 

I use an Arkel bug with the laptop compartment which fits my Mac (36.5 x 25 cm rectangular which is a 17.4" diagonal) and it works like a charm. It converts to a backpack which helps since I bike to and from the train. 

The problem with cross-chaining is that you put more stress on the chain which causes wear and tear on cassette teeth, eventually leading to the chain slipping gears. The chain line is one factor. The chain should ideally run in a plane from the front derailleur teeth back to the rear derailleur. It shouldn't be forced into a line on the teeth, and then angle as soon as it clears the teeth to get to the cassette as happens when cross-chaining because that causes teeth to wear. You're not going to fix the chain line except by making the chain and gear spacing narrower which requires weaker chains at a given price. The length of the rear derailleur cage determines how much slack it can pick up in the chain. If you size your chain big-to-big, and have a derailleur capable of picking up the slack then shifting into big-big shouldn't do damage. Shimano XT rear derailleurs have a 43 tooth capacity which should cover just about anything, but I had a touring bike with a wide range of gears that exhausted it. I managed to wedge things pretty well when my shifters got pushed into awkward positions on a train and I started riding without checking. 

I've had good experiences with these shifters. I can swap rear wheels from bike to bike without worrying about the details of the rear cassette. This lets me wake up in the morning and decide whether I want the wheel with the granny or one with a more closely spaced cogset. I have never used these shifters in indexed mode. 

The ability to handle a bike at high speeds; an awareness of where other cyclists and road hazards are even while moving at speed with few drag-inducing looks back; the ability to compress one's body into an aerodynamic shape while generating high levels of torque and hold this position for hours without losing blood flow to extremities; the ability to simultaneously monitor breathing, pedal pace, plan gear shifts, plan a route around road obstacles, and keep an eye out for attacks and maintain this focus for hours at a stretch; the ability to visually judge the grade of the road (and its derivative) and project momentum and power along that curve so that one can be in an efficient gear at all times. 

Even though I'm American, I wire all my bikes so that the right brake lever brakes the front so that I can signal left while having a hand free for the strong front brake. I think it's more important to be able to easily signal while merging left into traffic to take a left than to easily signal right where I don't have to cross lanes. If you ride in traffic much, I'd suggest trying it for a while and seeing if you like it better once you've adjusted. 

I've never done that, but in many places you are legally required to stop and render assistance. Also, it's the non-a**hole thing to do. 

EDIT: Based on questions in comments, let me clarify. I think 17/4 is probably well on the low side for a long race. I've done a double metric century with 3km of climbing and ridden the next day. I doubt I could run the day after a marathon on anything but a gentle downhill slope. For shorter distances though, it seems more reasonable. If I push myself for 10km (6.2 miles), I expect it would take more out of me than if I hammered for 42km (26 miles) miles, but that's because I'm a better cyclist. I think the hammering would take just as much extra out of some runner friends of mine. Weak cyclists can benefit from drafting a strong cyclist in a way that weak runners can't, but I think I'm strong enough to drop a strong runner/weak cyclist so that isn't a factor. I would definitely try to have the ride first though, because otherwise the run might take enough out of me that I would have more trouble dropping a tail. 

If you want to do a competition which gives a (good runner, mediocre cyclist) even chances against a (good cyclist, mediocre runner) then you might use the same ratio as the Ironman triathlon. It has a 112-mile (180.25 km) bike and a marathon 26.2-mile (42.2 km) run which puts the ratio of distance cycled/distance run at roughly 17/4.
