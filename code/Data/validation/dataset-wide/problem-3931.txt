Let me give you a geometric version of wrong way maps for smooth manifolds. Let us consider a smooth map $f:X\rightarrow Y$, for the sake of simplicity we assume that $X$ and $Y$ are closed and oriented (otherwise we need an orientability condition on the virtual normal bundle of $f$). We know that a class $C\in H_i(Y,\mathbb{Z})$ can be represented by a pseudo-manifold $Z$ (see for example Mark Goresky's paper "Whitney stratified chains and cochains." Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 267 (1981), 175-196). It means that: 

it's all about duality and the way you move operations from Hochschild homology to cyclic homology via the Connes'operator. The situation in the algebraic context of cyclic homology is as rich as the one first described by Moira chas and Dennis Sullivan in string topology see for example (part III) for the geometric story : $URL$ 

Let $M$ be a $1$-connected, closed, smooth manifold with $dim(M)>4$ and let us set $MCG(M)=\pi_0(Diff(M))$. Dennis Sullivan proved that $MCG(M)$ is commensurable to an arithmetic group. 

The canonical map $BPL\rightarrow BTOP$ is a rational homotopy equivalence by works of Thom, Novikov, Kirby-Siebenmann and others. In fact the homotopy fiber $TOP/PL$ is a $K(\mathbb{Z}/2,3)$. A nice reference is the survey "Piecewise Linear Structures on Topological Manifolds" by Rudyak. The canonical map $BO\rightarrow BPL$ is also a rational homotopy equivalence, this follows from smoothing theory. And the $i$-th homotopy groups of $PL/O$ are equal to zero when $i\leq 5$ isomorphic to $\Theta_i$ when $i\geq 6$. Where $\Theta_i$ is the group of exotic spheres: the equivalence classes of smoothing on $S^i$ under orientation-preserving diffeomorphism. As $\Theta_i$ are finite abelian groups you get your answer. 

Links of singularities of complex algebraic varieties are fascinating geometrical and topological objects. For example Brieskorn manifolfs. A Brieskorn manifold is the intersection of a small sphere around the origin with the singular complex hypersurface $$z_0^{k_1}+\cdots+z_n^{k_n}=0$$ they are closed smooth oriented $(n−2)$-connected $(2n−1)$-manifolds. They give examples of exotic spheres. The study of Brieskorn manifold and exotic spheres motivate the study of the surgerical classification of manifolds, stable homotopy groups of spheres (J-homomorphism, Adams' conjecture, Kervaire invariant.....), etc 

If you want to learn about algebraic topology, you can begin by very classical readings. When I was a Ph-D student, I first read Milnor Stasheff's book on "Characteristic classes", here you will learn a lot of differential and algebraic topology. There are so many good books to read, J.-F. Adams "Infinite loop spaces" or his blue book on "stable homotopy and generalised homologies", J. Milnor on Morse theory. I highly recommand Andrew Ranicki's homepage where you will find a lot of cool stuff about algebraic and geometric surgery, PL-topology, exotic spheres. Jacob Lurie also has some very good notes of his courses on his homepage. Dan Freed is giving a course on the cobordism and his notes are very nice, and you will find plenty of references here. You can also look at H. Miller notes "Notes on cobordism" and "Vector fields on spheres" (just google it). And J. P. May has also a list of very good books on his homepage. And overall, read classical papers by Adams, Pontryagin, Quillen, Serre, Sullivan, Thom...John Francis has a list of classical papers for the Kan seminar on his homepage. I am sure my list is too long and I have forgotten plenty of good references (homepages, notes of courses and books). 

Is there a known algorithm for approximating a fractal curve, say as specified by some iterative procedure e.g. a Koch snowflake, in terms of $f^{-1}(0)$ for some "simple" function $f$? Specifically, consider the set $\mathcal{F} = \{(x,y)|f(x,y) = 0 \}$ where $f(x,y) = \sum_{n,m=-N}^N t_{nm} e^{i n x + i m y}$ and $f$ is real. I would like a procedure to determine the parameters $t_{nm}$ such that the set $\mathcal{F}$ is close to the actual fractal curve. Presumably the number $N$ will grow as the required error decreases. I have been trying to approach this problem by truncating the iteration procedure for the fractal and approximating that piecewise linear curve, but I realized that I don't know a good way to do this either. This is my first time posting, so my apologies if the question is too elementary. 

Case of $\alpha =1$ This leaves open the question of $\alpha=1$. I came up with a trivial and very pathological counterexample showing that no simple theorem of the type I was asking about can exist. Consider a probability distribution over $n$-bit strings given by $p(0...0) = p + \frac{1-p}{2^n}$ and $p(other) = \frac{1-p}{2^n}$. For $\alpha <1$ then $n\rightarrow \infty$ we have $S_\alpha = n \ln{2}$ while for $\alpha=1$ then $n\rightarrow \infty$ we have $S_1 = (1-p) n \ln{2}$. The Renyi entropy for $\alpha > 1$ doesn't even scale with $n$. Keeping $\chi = e^{S_1}$ states leads to an error of $\epsilon = \frac{(2^n - 2^{(1-p)n})(1-p)}{2^n} \sim (1-p)$. Thus we can make $\epsilon$ as close to one as we like by taking $p$ to zero. 

Similar result for Renyi entropy I stumbled upon a weaker version of this result before finding Lemma 2 of $URL$ which also gives a simple proof using majorization. Let $p_\chi$ denote the probability distribution truncated to its $\chi$ largest values (see above), and let the error be $\epsilon = ||p-p_\chi||_1$. "Lemma 2": If $S_\alpha = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \ln{\left(\sum_n (p(n))^\alpha\right)}$ is the Renyi entropy then we have $ \ln{(\epsilon)} \leq \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} \left(S_\alpha - \ln{\left(\frac{\chi}{1-\alpha}\right)}\right)$ for $\alpha <1$. This gives a partial answer to my question in that keeping roughly $e^{S_\alpha}$ states for $\alpha <1$ is guaranteed to lead to small error. 

Question Fix a large number $S$. Let $p$ be a probability distribution with $p(n) \geq p(n+1)$ and entropy $S$, and let $p_S$ be the probability truncated to its first $e^S$ states i.e. $p_S(n \leq e^S) = p(n)$ and $p_S(n > e^S) = 0$. Is there a bound on the error $||p - p_S ||_1$ (varying $p$ with fixed $S$) or can I make this as close to one as I want? Thanks. 

Heuristic Background Consider a set of states labeled $n=1,2,...$ in order of non-increasing probability $p(n)$. The standard Shannon argument gives meaning to the entropy $S$ of $p$ in terms of the number of states needed to encode the distribution with small error in the limit of many iid copies. Roughly speaking I want to know how badly this can fail in the one-shot setting. My primary motivation is to understand how non-trivial it is to be able to show that $e^S$ states suffice to give small error for a given probability distribution. The distributions I have in mind have a system size-like parameter (like the number of iid copies) but the "copies" are correlated in a complicated way. Given the subject matter this may be a very elementary question, but I cannot seem to find much information on it.
