Call the police. Get his plate number, his description and report him to the authorities. Idiots like that are too thick to talk to, it takes an officer to get through to them. Call the cops while you're riding, tell them you fear for your safety and let them hear the idiot shouting at you. 

Use the Clutch! This is what I always tell people when I'm teaching them how to shift gears properly. Chain-rings and Cogs are machined with *pickup points" that assist transferring the chain from one ring to the other, they only work while you're turning the cranks. So I tell people to let all the power off of their pedals, but keep the cranks turning and don't step back into the pedals with any force until the chain has fully shifted. 

No it would not work. The pitt didn't form just because it was on the bottom, the pitt formed either because the cone came loose, or an abrasive got into the bearings. There's an equal amount of force being applied to the top of the cone as there is to the bottom when your hubs are properly adjusted. Think of the components in a hub as a stack, the cup is both the top and bottom of the stack, and the balls and cone are sandwiched in the middle, put some weight on the top of the stack and the force is going to be evenly distributed through everything. Your theory would only work if you left some play in the hub, which would only destroy the cones faster. Replace the cones and balls, they're cheap, and I imagine that you don't want to have a reputation of being a hack mechanic. 

Yes they are, it's called a bathroom or a toilet stall, you don't have to have a locker room to swap a pair of pants, just wear your lycra for your ride and pack your clothes in your bag. Then change in the bathroom when you get to work. Other than that, I once had a suit that was made out of wool-lycra, they're a little more expensive, but the material was certainly stretchy. 

You may need a longer derailleur, because you're going to need to run a longer chain to compensate for the extra teeth. Try swapping the chain first to see if the new cassette work with the shorter derailleur arm, but you may find that the chain will be too long, sag, and rub on itself between the pulley cogs when you're riding on your smallest ring. Whether it'll work or not depends entirely on gear ratios. 

I'm building a bike, got an Alfine hub for cheap, but the shifter feels like garbage. There're lots of new 11 speed shifters out this year, like the SRAM X1, do they work with the Alfine? 

I'm from BC, you have the option of taking the centre of the lane and waiting like a vehicle, or you can stay to the right if there is room (at least 1.5m or 5ft). If you stay to the right, basically you ride in an imaginary bike lane if there isn't one painted on the road, so you ride all the way up to the light on the right hand side of a line of cars at a red light. I do this pretty much every single day on my way home from work. Some intersections even have a button for cyclists to push, like the kind pedestrians push when they want to cross, but for cyclists waiting at the intersection. 

Wear something like this: The MET Parachute is similar to the the Giro switchblade, which used to be the most popular helmet on the market in Western Canada for MTB, because it was a full face helmet that weighted as much as an open face helmet. The switchblade saved my face when I smashed in into the sidewalk after slipping off the top of a highway divider on a hill. It would look a bit goofy on a road bike, but you could wear it just until you felt confident to ride open face again. 

Either the seller meant clipped pedal-as in you could bolt toe clips to it-or he didn't know what he was talking about. Those are not clipless pedals. They are VP road pedals that have an integrated toeclip: 

Bikes were the first rubber wheeled vehicles on the road, they're even the reason why paved roads were first layed. I've been pulled over by police while riding my bike here in Canada. They straight up told me that the same rules apply for bikes as they do for cars. Those include speed limits and traffic laws. I don't know UK laws, but I wouldn't expect to get anything out of rear ending a vehicle on my bike, because they would have had the right of way, if the same situation had happened here, I would be considered to be the party at fault, and therefore would be liable for the damages. As far as the speed claim, as long as you were doing the posted speed limit, then they shouldn't be able to touch you with that one, unless there's a different limit for cyclists in the UK. In response to their claim that you may have been exceeding whatever limit they claim you were, all you have to say is, "Prove it." They will then be required to launch an investigation to determine how fast your were going based on impact forces, which is determined by examining the damage sustained by the vehicle, and you. In your situation though, I'd consider myself extremely luck if I got anything out of this, because like I said, when you get into an accident on your bike on the road, they treat you like another vehicle, so you need to think about the whole situation as if you had been in a car. Had you been going the same speed and been in the same situation while driving a car, then what would you expect the outcome to be? Edit: After reading the comments and learning more about the pileup being caused by an oncoming vehicle, the only thing I think you could possibly be found guilty of is not maintaining a safe following distance. Obviously the oncoming vehicle is at fault, you should feel lucky that the car overtaking you softened the blow, had you been the one that hit the other car head on, chances are you wouldn't have woken up in the hospital at all. 

I would also inspect your bike, check what size rotors you're using and look for any obvious signs of oil leaks. I'd check the wear of your brake pads, and use a micrometer to check the wear on your rotors. I would look at the colour of your rotors, if they're blue then you've cooked them and they need to be replaced (Bluing steel makes it harder, harder steel means less friction–ergo–less stopping power). If nothing was visually obvious then I would bleed your brakes to check the condition of the oil, and make sure there isn't any air in the system. Shimano Brakes use mineral oil, which is different than the DOT brake oil that would go in your Hayes brakes. Different oils have different boiling points, DOT oil is regulated (DOT 3, DOT 4, DOT 5.1-The higher numbers reaching higher boiling points) But Mineral oil is not regulated, which is why it's recommended to use the manufacturers oil. Some shops use bulk mineral oil made for other applications because it's cheaper to buy (Shimano oil is expensive), but it may not necessarily have a high enough boiling point. If your oil isn't pink, then it's either dead, or not from Shimano. Opperational Issue This is the part where I grill people about how they ride. Improper riding habits are a mechanics bread and butter, I've replaced more parts from riders causing damage to them than from parts wearing out due to normal use. One of the bluest pair of rotors I've ever seen came off of a bike whose rider was probably a good 250lbs and rode about 10km back down a trail–that was ALL downhill–riding his back brake the whole way. You have two brakes for a reason, and the FRONT brake is the one with all the stopping power. When riding extreme DH, your back brake is for steering, your front is the one that stops you. You need to use them together when you need a lot of braking. I gave my big friend with the blue rotors a long lesson in proper braking, then installed a new 8' rotor on his rear wheel and a big 9' rotor on his front. He never had brake problems again. It's important to make sure you have a braking system that can handle you and what you ride, if you're bigger guy, then you're going to need bigger brakes, if you like to ride fast and steep, then again, you're going to need bigger brakes. 

When my 4 year old transitioned from her run bike to her first pedal bike, the one thing she struggled with was negotiating her pedals. She would try to 'run' on her pedal bike, and got frustrated real quick trying to figure out how to negotiate her pedals and cycle her feet. I think a trailer bike would be a good transition from a run bike to their first pedal bike. They already have all the balance they need from the run bike—they don't need training wheels—they just need to learn how to cycle the pedals (and brake/backwards pedal). Trailer bikes don't give them an opportunity to do anything else but cycle. I think a bit of riding on the trailer will give your kid the confidence he needs to hop on his own pedal bike without the training wheels. The trailer bike will give him an opportunity to develop some muscle memory as well as give you a little feel for how strong he's getting at pedaling and braking. 

New bikes at the very least require a full check and tune up out of the box. They also need to be "broken in" in many cases. New wheels can go out of true just from being ridden for the first time, one of my favourite things after building a new bike was to ride it around the shop and listen to all the spoke nipples make their "pinging" noises as they settled themselves into their spoke holes. Bikes in boxes get banged around during shipping too, I've opened boxes and seen brand new bikes with their wheels completely taco'd because someone crushed it with a forklift during shipping. they also get banged around and dropped just from being handled. Building a bike out of the box is rarely a simple matter of "some assembly required," I worked in one shop that required a one hour bike build, the owner insisted every part have it's threads greased and be reinstalled, including the shift and brake cables. Just because your bike is new doesn't mean it's going to be set up perfect. 

Note: There are plenty of accessory mounts that can do the same job as the loop on the h-bar, but I'm not interested in those. I'm looking for this exact style of bar, or a significantly similar bar. 

I've got a Specialized pump that's starting to do the exact same thing. Although there is a possibility that something simple could be going wrong with our pumps, the most likely explanation is that they have gotten some good use out of them over the years and as a result, they have worn out. Nothing lasts forever, especially not if it's got bushings, rubber seals and o-rings. I manage to extend the life of my pumps by oiling the seals, preferably with mineral oil as this tends to inflate the rubber seals a bit, but when something is worn out, it's worn out and simply needs replacing. You could rebuild your pump, but only if you can find a kit with all the parts you need, but there's no guarantee that would work like new. I'm planning on getting a new pump here pretty quick, you should probably do the same, it's a simple matter of life cycle replacement, count it as a regular maintenance expense. 

If you're bike is properly assembled, and fitted, then your problems rest not in the bike, but likely in your foot position and your pedal stroke. First, I would have your bike fit assessed to determine if you're riding the right sized bike, and that the saddle is properly adjusted. If the bike is properly fitted, then you need to change the position of your foot on your pedal and how you execute your powerstroke. One simple solution may be to switch to clipless pedals if you're not already using them. This will somewhat force you to place your feet on the pedals properly. Other than that what you need is physical training to train your legs to execute a proper stroke. Unless you simply have very large calves, it's likely that you have an improper balance of strength in the vastus muscles of your quad. You need to consciously train your leg not to come within proximity of your derailleur until your weaker muscles get stronger and you develop some muscle memory. If the reality is that you simply have large calves, then your only solution may be to remove the front derailleur and upgrade your bike to a 1x11 speed. until then, you can try wearing compression sleeves or socks to protect your skin. 

I was trying to determine the longest length I can safely cut my steer tube, then I learned about stem extenders. I have to wonder, if you cut your steer tube to the maximum recommended length for above and below your stem. Is it still safe to add on a stem height extender? Is using an extender any different than merely cutting your steer tube extra long? 

Riding with a rear brake only is a good way to wear out brake pads, rotors, and tires. The sooner you fix your front brake, the less likely you will be to have to replace other parts due to excess wear. The only bikes that have rear braking only, are kids bikes and coasters/cruisers, which sometimes have hub brakes. These are designed to take the full force of stopping the bike, but they work better than rim brakes on the rear because when you brake with your pedals you're forced to use proper body mechanics and leverage on the back pedal which puts your weight behind the bottom bracket, ergo more effectively weighting the back wheel. 

I bike all winter long, down to -30°C, there are some definite tolls to your bike at colder temperatures. Unlike a vehicle that warms up after the engine has been running for a while, bikes stay cold when you ride them cold. There are two things I notice the most, air pressure is definitely one of them; cold air shrinks, and low tires drag, so if you're riding dry roads I would certainly check to your pressure. Normally I don't put extra air in my tires, because up here the cold is usually accompanied by snow, and low tires give you better traction. The other thing I notice when it gets really cold is the grease in my bearings gets thicker, and as a result my hubs don't roll as fast. Pick your bike up and give the wheels a spin, you might find that they slow to a stop a lot quicker. I notice it in my headset too, but that doesn't affect speed. One thing I've done to avoid drag due to thick bearing grease is to actually replace the grease in my wheels with Phil Wood Tenacious Oil. I tried it out as an experiment one year, and I've never had problems with it since (I kept checking inside the hubs for a while expecting to find them dry and rusty, but Phil's oil lives up to it's name; it's tenacious). Of course the best thing to do is to not push yourself, compensate for the conditions, leave a bit earlier, find a new gear range that you can maintain a comfortable cadence in without giving yourself a heart attack, and just plough along. If the conditions are miserable already, there's no sense in making yourself more miserable.
