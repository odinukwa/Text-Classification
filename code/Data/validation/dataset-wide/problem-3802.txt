Is there any example of GIT quotients of linear actions on a Euclidean space ${\mathbb C}^n$ that satisfy the following conditions? 

Maybe some of the following statements are not precise. Please correct them. Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold. Let $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ be a Morse function. Then a generic Riemannian metric $g$ satisfies the Morse-Smale condition: for any two critical points $p$ and $q$, the unstable manifold $W^u(p)$ of the negative gradient flow of $f$ of $p$, and the stable manifold $W^s(q)$ of $q$ intersect transversely. Trajectories of this flow that connect $p$ and $q$ will approach to them exponentially. Now suppose $f$ has a degenerate critical point $p$. Let $q$ still be a non-degenerate critical point. Assume sufficient genericity, $p$ is then of "cubic type", i.e., near $p$, $f$ can be written as $f(x) = f(p) + x_1^3 + \sum_{j\geq 2} \pm x_j^2 +$ higher order terms. Now it seems to me that the unstable set $W^u(p)$ won't be a manifold in general, but a stratified space, with the top stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ polynomially(because there is a degenerate direction), and a lower stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ exponentially.(Is $W^u(p)$ necessarily a manifold with boundary?) And now, to ask about the transversality of $W^u(p) \cap W^s(q)$, it should be in a sense of stratified spaces. Is there any original paper that discuss this transversality? I know that Floer has two(maybe more) papers: The unregularized gradient flow of the symplectic action; Morse theory for Lagrangian intersections, which talked about the transversality about non-transverse Lagrangian intersections. Indeed his argument can be carried out for Morse theory. I wonder if there is any more original and more elementary argument about this transversality? 

A Lagrangian foliation over its base $(q,p) \mapsto q$. A one parameter dilatation group $t\mapsto [(q,p) \mapsto (q,e^t p)]$. 

The concept of "differential symplectic geometry" has been introduced I believe by J.-M. Souriau in is 1953 paper @inproceedings{Sou53, Author = {Jean-Marie Souriau}, Booktitle = {Coll. Int. CNRS}, Pages = {53}, Publisher = {CNRS, Strasbourg}, Title = {G{\'e}om{\'e}trie symplectique diff{\'e}rentielle. Applications.}, Year = {1953}} He introduces there the concept of "Variétés isotropes saturées", called today "lagrangian manifolds", name given later by V.-I. Arnold. 

Actually if you allow infinite dimension, every symplectic manifold is a coadjoint orbit of its group of symplectomorphisms. That is even more... how to say? Symplectic :-) If you want a reference there is a diffeological version of this theorem here It is also in the Memoir here §10 

Note 1. that this construction can be applied to any homogeneous lagrangian, and for non-homogeneous lagrangian, first we homogenize them and after we apply this construction. Bibliography Jean-Marie Souriau, "Structure des Systèmes Dynamiques", Dunod ed., Paris 1970 

There is another way around, starting with Lagrange, but bypassing his variational construction to reach immediately the presymplectic construction. Considering the motion of a point submitted to a force $F$, you can define the following $2$-form(${}^*$) $\omega$ on the space $Y$ of initial conditions $(x,v,t) \in {\bf R}^3 \times{\bf R}^3 \times {\bf R}$ $$ \omega(\delta y)(\delta'y) = \langle\delta v - F\delta t , \delta' x - v\delta' t \rangle - \langle \delta' v - F\delta' t , \delta x - v\delta t \rangle, $$ where $\delta y = (\delta x, \delta v, \delta t) \in T_yY$, idem for $\delta'y$. You can notice that the kernel of this 2-form is generated by the equations of motion: $$ \ker(\omega_y) = \{ \delta y \mid \delta x = v \delta t \quad \mbox{and} \quad \delta v = F \delta t\}. $$ In other words, the motions of the point submitted to the force $F$ are the integral curves of the vectorial distribution $y \mapsto \ker(\omega_y)$. You can check that if $F$ does not depend on $v$ and if $F$ is derived from a potential $F = - dU$ then $\omega$ is closed, therefore presymplectic, and the space of characteristics of $\omega$, that is, the solutions of your dynamical system, is then equipped with a symplectic structure. Now we can rephrase your question in the presymplectic framework: what are the condition on $F$, depending a priori from $y=(x,v,t)$, for $\omega$ to be closed? First of all you can notice that the form $\omega$ writes $$ \omega = \omega_0 \oplus F \cdot dx \wedge dt, $$ where $\omega_0$ is the standard symplectic form on ${\bf R}^3 \times {\bf R}^3$. The condition for $\omega$ to be closed writes then $d[F\cdot dx] \wedge dt = 0$. In other words we need $d[F \cdot dx]$ to be proportional to $dt$. If you make the computation you'll find that the partial derivative $\partial F_i / \partial v^j$ must vanish and for all $t$, $d[x \mapsto F_t(x)] = 0$, that is, $F_t = -dU$, where $U$ depends on $(x,t)$. Thus if you add a dissipative term in your force, you lose the symplectic structure on the space of solutions, and therefore all the conservation theorems associated. (*) This construction is due to Cartan, Galissot, Souriau. 

Suppose $X$ is a topological manifold and $Y \subset X$ is a locally flat submanifold. We know that $Y$ doesn't necessarily have a tubular neighborhood. My definition of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$ is a neighborhood $U$ with a map $\pi: U \to Y$ which is identity on $Y$ and $\pi: U \to Y$ is a disk bundle over $Y$. The locally flatness implies, however, every point $p\in Y$ has a neighborhood in $Y$ which has a tubular neighborhood. So "having a tubular neighborhood" is a property which cannot be simply glued from local to global. However, I wonder if the following is true. Suppose $Y$ has an open cover $\{Y_i\}$ and each $Y_i$ has a tubular neighborhood $\pi_i: U_i \to Y_i$. Suppose we require that $\pi_i$ agree on overlaps, i.e., $\pi_i(U_i \cap U_j) = \pi_j(U_i \cap U_j), \forall i,j$ Can this condition imply the existence of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$? Or, what should be the correct and natural condition to gurantee the gluing from local to global? 

In a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, $J$-holomorphic curves are special minimal surfaces if $J$ is compatible with the symplectic structure and the metric is induced by $\omega$ and $J$. Minimal surfaces satisfy the monotonicity property, i.e., if $S$ is a minimal surface passing through $p$, then for $r$ small enough, the area of $S \cap B_r(p)$ is at least $c r^2$, for some constant $c>0$ depending on the metric. This property can be used to prove, for example, the removal of singularity of $J$-holomorphic curves, and also, the diameter of a $J$-holomorphic curve cannot be arbitrarily large if the energy (area) is bounded. In Gromov-Witten theory, one also consider perturbations of the Cauchy-Riemann equation, as $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$, for other reasons. If just to prove removal of singularity, we can view the graph of a solution as a holomorphic curve in $\Sigma \times M$ (if domain is $\Sigma$), with respect to some almost complex structure on $\Sigma \times M$ depending on $\nu$. But my question is, if $\nu$ is sufficiently small (in $C^0$, for example), can we prove a monotonicity result for a solution $u$ to $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$ (but not its graph)? I suspect this holds because for $\nu$ small, a solution should be close to a real $J$-holomorphic curve. 

Consider the solution $b(u) \in L^2(0,T;H^1)\cap H^1(0,T;H^{-1})$ with $u \in L^2(0,T;H^1)$ to $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}b(u) - \Delta u = f$$ where $b$ is continuous, increasing and locally Lipschitz and $f \in L^2(0,T;L^2)$. How to obtain a comparison principle for this equations of this form? So I want to show that if $f_1 \geq f_2$ and $b(u_{01}) \geq b(u_{02})$ that $b(u_1) \geq b(u_2)$ a.e. When the solution is smoother, the standard technique is: actually the solution $b(u)$ is constructed from a series of approximate problems where we consider the equation with $b_m$ replacing $b$ where $b_m$ is a smooth approximation of $b$. These approximations have solutions $b(u^m) \in H^1(0,T;L^2) \cap L^2(0,T;H^1)$ and we multiply the equation (which now holds pointwise) by $s_\epsilon(u^m_1 - u^m_2)$ where $s_\epsilon$ is an approximation of the function $\text{sign}^+(x) = \chi_{(0,\infty)}(x)$. Then we can pass to the limit in $\epsilon$ (only require convergence in $L^2(0,T;L^2)$) and in $m$. But in my particular case I only have $\partial_t b(u_m) \in L^2(0,T;H^{-1})$ so the equation does not hold pointwise and so we need to take duality pairings instead of multiplying with the $s_\epsilon(\cdot)$. And we cannot pass to the limit in $\epsilon$ because we would need a convergence of the form $s_\epsilon(u^m_1-u^m_2) \to \text{sign}^+(u^m_1-u^m_2)$ in $L^2(0,T;H^1)$ which doesn't hold. So how do you get around this? 

Let $V \subset H \subset V^*$ be a Gelfand triple (eg. $H^1 \subset L^2 \subset H^{-1}$). Let $u \in L^2(0,T;V)$ have a distributional derivative $u' \in L^2(0,T;V^*)$. So $\int_0^T u(t)\varphi'(t) = -\int_0^T u'(t)\varphi(t)$ holds for all $\varphi \in C_c^\infty(0,T)$ as an equality in $V^*$. Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function with $f'$ bounded. Suppose $u' \in L^2(0,T;L^2)$; then the chain rule formula for the weak derivative $(f(u))' = f'(u)u' \in L^2(0,T;L^2)$ makes sense. But if $u' \in L^2(0,T;H^{-1})$ only, how to make sense of $(f(u))'$? Is it right to define the derivative as $$\langle (f(u))', v \rangle := \langle u', f'(u)v \rangle$$ if for all $v \in L^2(0,T;H^1)$, $f'(u)v \in L^2(0,T;H^1)$? Where may I find more details about this sort of thing? I'd like to avoid BV spaces and measures because this is simpler. Thank you. 

Consider a family of complex curves ${\mathcal C} \to {\mathbb D}$ such that the central fibre is a nodal Riemann surface while other fibres are smooth Riemann surfaces. We choose a family of conformal metrics by restricting a smooth metric on ${\mathcal C}$. So near the nodes (with local models $xy = t$, where $t$ is the coordinate on ${\mathbb D}$), the metric is roughly the restriction of the Euclidean metric on ${\mathbb C}^2 = \{(x, y)\}$. Let $\Delta_t$ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the fibre over $t$. What is the behavior of the spectra of $\Delta_t$, or rather the few lowest positive eigenvalues of $\Delta_t$, as $t\to 0$? I (sort of) know in the case of a single separating nodes, the lowest positive eigenvalue of $\Delta_t$ converges to 0 in a rate comparable to $(\log |t|)^{-1}$, while other positive eigenvalues stay uniformly away from $0$. I want to know about the case that the node is non-separating, as well as the case of multiple nodes. The result I look for is not simply the convergence of spectra, but also the rate of convergence of the few lowest eigenvalues. More generally, is there any reference/results about the behavior of the Laplacian spectra of families of higher dimensional manifolds with normal crossing degenerations? 

We know that a mixed Hodge structure on a complex vector space $H$ with an integral lattice $H_{\mathbb Z}$ consists of the weight filtration and the Hodge filtration. For an isolated hypersurface singularity represented by a function germ $f: ({\mathbb C}^n, 0) \to ({\mathbb C}, 0)$, we have the vanishing cohomology bundle $${\mathscr H}^* = \bigcup_{t \in {\mathbb D}^*} H^{n-1}(V_t; {\mathbb C}) \to {\mathbb D}^*.$$ Here $V_t = f^{-1}(t)$. A mixed Hodge structure can be defined on the fibres of ${\mathscr H}^*$. Let $\{{\mathscr F}^p\}_{p=0}^n$ be the Hodge filtration. The integral lattice is spanned by the parallel integral cocycles with respect to the Gauss-Manin connection. A simple case is that when $f$ is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial. Suppose $d_1,\ldots, d_n, D$ are integers such that $$f( t^{d_1} z_1, \ldots, t^{d_n} z_n) = t^D f(z_1, \ldots, z_n).$$ Denote $\nu_i = d_i / D$. Then for the holomorphic $n$-form $\omega = z_1^{k_1}\cdots z_n^{k_n} dz_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz_n$, we have the so-called ``geometric sections'' of the cohomology bundle, whose value at $t$ is the residue form $$\big[\frac{\omega}{df}\big]|_{V_t}.$$ This section belongs to ${\mathscr F}^p$ if and only if the charge of $\omega$, given by $l = \sum_{i=1}^n (k_i+1) \nu_i$, is less than or equal to $n-p$. (One can refer to the book ``Singularity I'' of Arnold etc.) Here is the question: for quasi-homogeneous singularity, what is the complex conjugation of a geometric section (which can be given explicitly)? In the paper "${\mathcal N}=2$ Landau-Ginzburg vs. Calabi-Yau $\sigma$-models: non-perturbative aspects" by S. Cecotti, there is a physics description of this complex conjugation on page 1766 which I don't quite understand (especially the term of ``spectral flow''). Is there any mathematical literature which contains such discussion? 

So, thanks to these two constructions you can represent smoothly any closed 1-forms or 2-forms on second countable manifolds whatever the group of period is, and any closed 1-forms or 2-forms on diffeological space with a diffeologically discrete group of periods. You can find the proofs of that in the paper La trilogie du moment (published in 1995), for the manifold case, and also in the book Diffeology, §8.42, published this year, for the general diffeological case. Now, for higher degree, I must say that I have no satisfactory construction to propose. The fact is that if you look to represent a closed 3-form thanks to a structure bundle, it's a dead end because on $S^3$, every principal bundle with structure group a Lie-like group is trivial(${}^3$) (because $\pi_2(G)=0$). Personally, I'm not satisfied with what I read in the literature on the subject. (1) Book Diffeology, §6.83. (2) For a general diffeological space this is still a work in progress. (3) Not true for a general diffeological group. 

Let's assume now that these two conditions are satisfied, we can define a natural map $\Phi : M \to T^*Q$ by $$ \Phi(x) = (q = \pi(x), p = [\delta q \mapsto \omega_x(\xi(x),\delta x)]) \quad \mbox{with} \quad \pi_*(\delta x) = \delta q. $$ Here $\delta q \in T_qQ$, $\delta x \in T_xM$. Because the Liouville field is tangent to the polarization, $\omega_x(\xi(x),\delta x)$ depends only on $\delta q = \pi_*(\delta x)$, and therefore $p$ belongs to $T^*_qQ$. Now this map $\Phi$ satisfies: $$ \Phi(\lambda) = \alpha \quad \mbox{and then} \quad \phi^*(d\lambda) = \omega, $$ where $\lambda$ is the canonical Liouville 1-form $pdq$ on $T^*Q$. Now, since $d\lambda$ and $\omega$ are symplectic the tangent linear map $D(\Phi)_x$ is non degenerate, $\ker D(\Phi)_x = \{0\}$ for all $x$. Thus, $\Phi$ is an étale map, that is, a local diffeomorphism everywhere. Hence, $(M,\omega)$ is not far to be a cotangent bundle, we can already say that $\omega$ is the pullback of the standard symplectic form $d\lambda$ on a cotangent $T^*Q$ by an étale map which is already a bit of interesting information. It remains to give some conditions on the polarization to move from an étale map to a diffeomorphism. I don't know if it is exactly the sense you gave to your question but it may help to apprehend the situation. 

When considering the heat kernel of a Schr\"odinger operator $$- \Delta + V(x) $$ where $\Delta$ is the standard Laplacian on ${\mathbb R}^n$ and $V$ is a nonnegative potential function that has nice behavior at infinity (proper, grows polynomially), one usually sees the term $$e^{-tV(x)}$$ and the asymptotic expansion of the Gaussian integral $$\int_{{\mathbb R}^n} e^{-t V(x)},\ t \to 0.$$ If $V(x)$ is homogeneous, namely, $V(rx) = r^\alpha V(x)$, the above integral is just a power of $t$ (in particular, no log term). However it seems that in more general case when $V(x)$ is not homogeneous, for example, when $$V(x, y) = V_1(x, y) + V_2(x, y)$$ which is the sum of two homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, the expansion may have $\log t$ terms. Question: What is the general form of the asymptotic expansion of this integral as $ t\to 0$? 

Let $E\to B$ be a fibre bundle. The Leray-Hirsch theorem states under suitable assumptions, the cohomology of $E$ is an $H^*(B)$-module generated by suitable cohomology classes in $E$. Is there any analogous results for the homology of $E$? Any reference? 

Let $(M, \omega)$ be a symplectic manifold and $G$ be a compact Lie group. Suppose we have a Hamiltonian $G$-action on $M$, with moment map $\mu: M \to {\mathfrak g}^*$. We assume that the moment map is proper in case $M$ is noncompact. The question is: for any loop $\gamma: S^1 \to G$, and a point $x\in M$, is the loop $t\mapsto \gamma(t) x$ a contractible loop in $M$? So we assume neither $G$ or $M$ is simply-connected. We may assume that $\gamma$ is actually a 1-parameter subgroup of $G$, generated by a vector $\xi \in {\mathfrak g}$. In the case $M$ is compact, we restrict the moment map to this subgroup, which is equivalent to a real valued function $\mu_\gamma$. Then the gradient flow of this function should push the loop to a critical point, which is a fixed point of this subgroup. Hence this shows that the loop is contractible. Now if $M$ is noncompact, the gradient flow doesn't necessarily converge to a critical point (could escape to $\pm \infty$). Note that the real valued function $\mu_\gamma$ is not necessarily proper. So the above method fails. But I still guess that the loop should be contractible. Is there any proof or counter-example? Or should we add some conditions to guarantee this?
