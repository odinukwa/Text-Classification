So I can't see why Luodian was so important, given its poor (apparent) strategic value and defensibility. And yet both sides considered it important and fought hard for it: 

"Hat hair" was a universal affliction when all men wore hats. Sometimes they don't bother to fix it up after taking off the hat, even when taking a photograph, and so you end up with photos like this: 

According to the book of Han, it's 100 plus some (百餘人). The full entry is as follows and pretty much matches the description on Wikipedia: 

Retirement as a common practice is a relatively modern concept, borne out of the industrial revolution and extended lifespans. In traditional societies, the treatment of the elderly varies a lot. The anthropologist Jared Diamond discusses this in his book The World Until Yesterday, and in talks. It can range from neglect, suicide or outright murder (see The Ballad of Narayama), to reverence and valued members of the tribe. Many elders remained productive and valuable as repositories of wisdom: 

Because only an invasion, or a credible threat of it, will have brought unconditional surrender. The latter let the Allies neutralise the strategic threat from Japan, by replacing their military dictatorship with a pacifist democracy and reducing the Emperor to a figurehead. There's some possibility that Japan may have fought on, at least to defend the home islands, as evidenced by an attempted coup to prevent the acceptance of surrender, despite being nuked. Before the nukes and Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the government was actually unwilling to surrender. How much of the surrender was because of the nukes or because of the Soviets is up for debate. On that note, there's the spectre of the Soviets rushing into Japan before the US, as they did in East Germany, and as they half-did in Korea. If the US was unwilling to invade, that's basically inviting the Soviets to take their place and gain a surrender favourable to them. Besides, blockades aren't as great as you make it out to be. Starving and isolating an entire country doesn't exactly endear yourself to the population. We have at least two real-life examples of what happens: North Korea and Iraq between the gulf wars. Both regimes are/were stable and hostile as ever. Compared to them, the outcome for Japan was a miracle. 

If you want to see some actual examples (photos, diagrams, paintings) of how medieval children dressed, here are some useful links: 

What is the longest sustained retreat by a military force in history, by total length? Not counting naval examples, as they can be much longer. When I search for it I get a lot of results to the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, which is the longest retreat in US history, but at 120 mi (190 km) it is dwarfed by a more famous retreat, of the French from Moscow. Still, that may not be the longest in all history. Which one is the longest? 

During Mao's reign, the predominant strategic doctrine was People's war. That is, when suffering a large scale invasion, the defenders would avoid direct engagements and allow the invaders to enter deep into home territory, harass them while mobilising the people, then counterattacking only when an overwhelming numerical advantage is available. Under such a doctrine, the threat of nuclear strikes is downplayed: 

Blackletter was once widely used throughout Europe, as it was quicker to write and more condensed than its predecessor, Carolingian minuscule. This was important at the time, because people wanted to read about more things, but writing was laborious, and paper and parchment were expensive. The downside is that Blackletter is less legible. 

Traction trebuchets were the earliest kind of trebuchet, where instead of the more familiar counterweight, the force came from lots of men pulling ropes attached to the short arm: 

Out of the major powers of WWII (Germany/Japan/Italy, USSR/US/UK/China, perhaps others), what were their officers' casualty rates? Were any unusually low or high? Officers are important parts of armies; the loss of a unit's officers in battle greatly diminishes their effectiveness, they are also hard to replace, as it usually takes years to train one. Between different armies, officer casualty rates might differ for many reasons, like how effectively their tactics protect their officers, or how much their doctrine places them at risk, like leading from the front, or emphasising personal heroism. I tried looking online, but usually the statistics are specific to one country, or a comparison between branches and eras. I would like to see a comparison across the different powers of WWII. 

No single factor determines the outcomes of all battles and wars, this is true even for the most important one, logistics. Usually when a side fights on home territory, can field bigger armies that are better equipped and fed, then have they have better logistics. Yet we can still find plenty of examples of such sides losing, like Agincourt: 

Just as it is often said that Operation Barbarossa is Hitler's biggest strategic blunder (either the whole thing, its timing or execution), what were Chiang Kai-shek's biggest strategic blunders in the Second Sino-Japanese war, and why? For example, I've often heard that the Battle of Shanghai should not have been fought since it was indefensible (the IJN and air force could provide full support) and the NRA lost its most elite troops. However I've also heard that it was all part of a master plan of luring Japan to overextend. Which is true, or what else would be a big blunder? 

While researching this topic, I found an excellent article on this very subject: Russia and China: the young vs. old leaders. Two communist systems - but how different. It contrasts the rapid pace of reform in China compared to that of USSR, in 1987. If you want to read an answer from a real expert from the time, as opposed to amateurs on the internet, just go there. There were indeed many factors making modernisation slow in USSR, but fast in China post-Mao. While it's true that younger generations are generally more reform-minded than the old, in this case it would be a minor factor - indeed, as the article notes, the 56-year-young Gorbachev is slower to reform than the elderly 82-year-old Deng. There were many reform-minded people in the older generations, even in USSR. 

Eventually the NRA simply compensated by using corps, composed of 2-3 divisions, as the basic tactical unit: 

Hideyoshi launched the invasion of Korea in 1592, with the aim of conquering Korea first and using it as a base for eventual conquest of China. As things turned out, although the superior Japanese army made great progress at first (starting from Busan, taking Pyongyang and most of the peninsula in 3 months), they could not advance any further and were pushed out of Korea eventually, in 1598. The way I see it, the Japanese had severe strategic shortcomings that made the stated goals (conquest of Korea and China) wildly unrealistic: 

Here you can clearly see that Luodian is a transportation hub; it is at the crossroad of two roads: Jiading-Baoshan, and Liuhe-Dachang. The key point is that this crossroad straddled the entire northern beachfront. The Japanese had made landings at multiple locations from Liuhe to Baoshan; taking Luodian would mean they can easily consolidate their landing forces there by using the roads leading from the coast. In this sense Luodian is somewhat analogous to Caen or Saint-Lô in the Battle of Normandy. It was also important to the Chinese as they can use the roads to transfer troops between Luodian, mainland reinforcements via Jiading, and downtown Shanghai via Dachang, forming a defensive line that protected the all-important Jinghu railway. Jiading, one end of the crossroads, was a large town that stood between Luodian and the railway. Even more important was Dachang, and after Luodian was taken, the Japanese followed the road to Dachang, but not before heavy fighting on the Yunzaobin River, which ran between Luodian and Dachang. Wikipedia mentions several locales that Luodian connects. Without qualification, some of these seem redundant:
