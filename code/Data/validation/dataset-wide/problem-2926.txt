Consciousness: the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings. (Thanks Google!) Well from a grammatical perspective we're certainly safe. I would hold the burden of evidence to be on the counter-argument in this case. I know of no non-egocentric reason to assume that thoughts and feelings are a pre-requisite for consciousness, or even that the human mind is a pre-requistite for thoughts or feelings. 

I would argue that there is an implicit trade-off between bias and decisiveness, similar to trade-offs between accuracy and precision. I take the following to be an unbiased statement. 

Oh no, you asked an extension question about taking a position. Well that makes this harder. I would argue that being sufficiently informed to produce a position on any issue will necessarily introduce non-zero bias. However, we may be able to further refine our answers. For example, perhaps we can eliminate one of the above cases with the following definition: 

Pascal's wager is a special case of Pascal's mugging in which the mugger claims infinite power. I'm not really clear on which formations of the wager and mugging you're discussing as they seem to differ for the originals that I am familiar with, but I will attempt to shed some light on your questions. ================================================================================== 

No. Kant just considers plain old unadulterated pure reason. He does not look at pure reason plus now with bacon. Perhaps that's because by "pure", Kant means pure and non-human reasons are experienced as phenomena. The only reason we have access to as a ding an sich is human reason. Not requiring a super natural being to keep the world in order while not falling into radical skepticism is the cornerstone of his insight. 

Legally a corporate body may be a person. Philosophically, neither it nor its board is a moral or ethical agent. The individuals who sit on the board are the relevant moral or ethical agents. A corporate body may have rules that define what constitutes a conflict of interest and ethically obligate those agents toward certain actions. Or the corporate body may not. Operationally, a board depends upon people with an interest in the corporate body which the board oversees. Where one person may see a conflict of interests, another may see alignment. And the appearance of a potential conflict of interest is not in fact an actual conflict. 

The question presumes that we have epistemic access to objective causality, or at least that we believe we have such access. However, any non-skeptical theory or law of causality presumes that causes and effects exist with the price of avoiding that presumption being utter incoherence. Philosophically speaking, one must either have their cake or eat it. An argument based on causality can't serve as the rational basis for raising concerns over how anything can exist. Logically speaking, if one's cosmology already admits the supernatural - perhaps in the form of a beginningless and endless pure being that arranges all things - then requests for evidence are not asked within the spirit of scientific enquiry. Not that there's anything wrong with that, only that one must accept the the character of inputs determines the character of outputs. That is to say that deducing a contradiction means that at least one of the premises is false. For example, a contradiction derived from the original question means that "There is something which exists that was never created" is false. 

It is fairly straight-forward to construct a Turing machine from a given finite start space and a given Turing machine that, in a finite number of states and finite amount of time (which is constant) produces a given start state and then runs the given Turing machine on the input. That is to say, it reduces to standard computation. 

So X either wants a license not to respect teachers, or the teachers to respect X. What X can control: X can show respect or not show respect. Strategy 1: X does not show respect. As X does not show respect, by X's own philosophy teacher's won't show respect. Therefore no respect is earned and no respect is shown. It is possible teachers may take initiative to show respect. I'm not going to cover that possibility as we know X has already taken initiative in this example. Strategy 2: X does show respect. As X shows respect, X is worth of respect. Case 1: If teachers operate under X's philosophy or similar they show respect to X. Mutual respect earned and shown. Case 2: If teachers operate under another philosophy, they may not show respect to X. X has earned respect but does not receive it, teachers have not earned respect but do receive it. Determining the optimal strategy then requires understanding pay-offs. Now, as the purpose of interacting with teachers is education, you could, for example, place a value of infinity on teachers receiving respect and a value of zero on teachers not receiving respect, as this should maximize educational potential. This would make strategy 2 optimal. If, however, education is not the aim, and minimizing cost is where respect confers a non-zero cost, then strategy 1 is optimal. I don't know X's utility curve, but this is the game theory beyond my recommendation. I do assume a non-zero value on education and a zero cost on showing respect, because that is the curve I operate under and was how I determined my own actions when I was in a circumstance akin to X's, and that is why I will always recommend strategy 2 as optimal. 

Like many philosophical concepts, one need look no further than Plato. The Delphic maxim γνῶθι σεαυτόν or "know thyself" is oft used by his protagonist, Socrates. 

It seems as if your support for classifying Nagel as a panthesist is to take him at his word in regard to his claims about his beliefs without exception except when it comes to his claim about his atheism. I don't see any reason to carve out this exception or to assert Nagel is using "atheist" incorrectly based on the evidence provided in the question. Therefore, no. 

Sometimes it can be a case of "moving the goal posts". Other times it is "no silver bullet." It largely depends on the rhetorical context and can be nothing more than Randell Monroe's [of xkcd] "Someone is wrong on the internet": ie. no more than being argumentative. 

For Kant, we can only see objects that take up space because space is an a priori condition of all human experience of the external world[1]. For Kant, space does not exist independently of human experience. We might say space is the medium of our experience of the external world. Experience of the external world without space is as sound in a vacuum, for Kant it doesn't exist. Kant's point is metaphysical (and perhaps psychological). Wittgenstein's point is about language. Pictures have borders, we are only confusing ourselves and perhaps others if we talk about the part of a picture that isn't on the canvas. [1] For Kant, time is the a priori condition of all inner experience. 

Those seemed to be the most common and applicable terms when I was reading Marx. EDIT: Thanks Google! 

Not that any member of the set that never transitions from not yet existing to existing is not a part of everything, a contradiction, and there was once (presumably) nothing, so all members of everything experience at least one state transition. Ah hah, no we're getting into the subtleties of grammar. Is the Statue of Zeus a concept? In which case, the concept still exists. Is the Statue of Zeus an arrangement of matter? If so, no matter still exists in that arrangement, but the actual nature of the arrangement still exists as a possibility. Is the Statue of Zeus a specific incidence of an arrangement of matter? If so, then that specific incidence has experienced in second transition into formerly existing. So let's take members of the set of everything to also have the following attributes: an arrangement (for concepts we can use bit-modeled neural arrangements) and an incidence. So every member of the set of everything has a state, an arrangement, and an incidence. Take anything to be a member of the set of everything that is either in the state of not yet existing or formerly existing. Then anything does not exist but is still anything because it exists at another point in time. Similarly, the corollary for space would bundle a location with a member, so that if the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were moved to say, Missoula, then the Statue of Zeus at Olympia would no longer exist and therefore not exist, even though a member of everything with the same arrangement, incidence, and state would still exist. Alternatively, incidence could be tied to location. 

If the scope of the question allows for philosophical answers then it is clearly philosophical. If it can only be answered acceptably from a scientific standpoint then it clearly isn't. To put it another way, if the questions premises preclude the possibility of Kantian subjectivity regarding knowledge of time and space, ordinary language analysis, feminist critique, etc., then it is perhaps not philosophical. If Plato and Hume and Nietzsche cannot possibly bring anything to the discussion, the question might be more physics than philosophy, so to speak. In the end, if the question is premised on the same set of assumptions about the world that one uses in the scientific investigations of physics, then as philosophers we should be on guard. One feature that distinguishes philosophy is the questioning the foundations if our world views. 

Yes Kant was right about space and time (and no he was not wrong about knowledge) where being right about space and time and not being wrong about knowledge are epistemological claims. Critique of Pure Reason is a response to radical skepticism. It offers the comfort of legitimizing the existence of facts in regard to empirical phenomena. The price is that the these facts are always subject to the caveat that they are mediated through and limited by the natural limits of human experience. We can talk as if the results of an experiment confirm facts about space and time, but we're simply committed to a convenience. Humans can wonder What is it Like to Be a Bat, but it is an error to assume there exists some bat so Nagely as to wonder what it is like to be a human. There is no legitimate basis for a claim that bats can wonder at all. To say that "Kant was clearly wrong" is to misunderstand the problem he was tackling. For millenia, the best philosophical responses to radical skepticism required Descarte's gods and proofs thereof. After Kant, it was still about two hundred years until G.E. Moore's offered a simple god free response to radical skepticism. However, the horrible price for Moore's stance is any claim to being clever. 

(b) Objective standards are fundamentally pointless. Well relativism doesn't really specifically address whether objective standards have a point or not. Mainly, it places limits on societies to practice imperialism but in no way enforces the validity of this belief. So, for example, while a cultural relativist will not take a strong stance against sexism, relativism does not innately reject this stance as wrong or useless, merely as unreasonable. (c) What has happened in the past is irrelevant Cultural relativism, to me, seems to have two purposes: 

And also less accurate. I would argue that by not believing in anything you are protected from bias. Whether it is possible to have no opinions or beliefs is perhaps another question, but I believe by having no opinions to be biased about, it would necessarily result in no bias. 

Happiness is to be earned. Kindness is to be earned. Justice is important. The value of life is a function of its genetic similarity to myself. Rules are relative. 

Well if there were actually people out there that could perform such magic, the probability of meeting one would scale with the power of their magic in theory. Then, the God of Pascal's wager is just a Pascal mugger (or blesser) with infinite power. By Robin Hanson's criteria, this infinite power confers an infinite improbability. ================================================================================== 

Agree or not, the famous computer scientist's position illustrates how slippery the proposition "X has beliefs" is when we attempt to grasp and hold it. 

Political sanction: there are no official state superstitions nor high priests of superstition. [at the one sentence level of question and answer and analysis]. 

In practice, we would tend to have a strong logical presumption that is not identical based on one being called "a" and the other called "b" because the difference in names implies a spatial and/or temporal difference in the conditions under which each is encountered. The burden of proof falls on those claiming "Hesperus is Phosphorus." The premise that classic philosophic logic has some strong principle of identity is a bit suspect in itself. The Ship of Theseus has been an important paradox since the early days of philosophy. The real problem is that "the same" requires disambiguation if we're talking in a logical context. Thus formal languages in computing often have multiple predicates for sameness [e.g Lisp's , , and ]. Pierce's pragmatic maxim perhaps points the way. is not identical if and only if the effects of are not identical to the effects of . 

Data is what information in encoded in as symbols on the tape of a universal Turing machine for model in which the Universe runs on a Turing machine. Information would be the location and velocity of all particles in the Universe as well as any knowledge derived from that. Data is uninterpreted encryption of that information. ================================================================================== It was not my understanding that philosophy functioned on meaningful different (rather just more specific) definitions than general language on this issue. The definitions of each per Google here: 

Well, as a computer scientist, to me, your mind is a series of one bit processors (neurons) wired together on a direct weight graph (nerves). I understand that this model is based on physicalism, but it may also be completely formulated mathematically and I find it to predict my actions accurately. I would argue that there is considerable evidence that our understanding of mathematics is philosophically credible. I'm entirely uncertain what about that I can't simulate on a Turing Machine, or what esle, if this is incomplete explanation, couldn't be simulated. In that sense, I believe the onus is on you to provide any reason at all whatsoever that there would be any part of consciousness that isn't Turing complete. I'd say that this requires an explicit definition of consciousness. That is, I'm struggling to see any reasonable question here without a hard definition on Qualia. Because any Qualia that I can think of, as my mind is Turing complete, would necessarily also be Turing complete. I hope that makes sense. Thank you. ================================================================================== Edit: I thought I should produce a Turing machine. Let us take as given that you have a finite lifespan. Let us also take as given you can think a finite number of thoughts at any given point in time. Let us also take as given that thoughts take non-zero time, so that time may be discretized. Suppose then that Goddess monitors your every thought and constructs a Turing machine that procedurally outputs your exact thoughts under your same circumstances. Note that this machine would have a finite number of states. I'd consider that an existence proof of you as Turing complete. 

Having been a companion to dogs throughout my life, I don't generally suppose that dogs are not self aware. Unless one defines 'thinking' as only encompassing the way in which humans think. In that case, the answer is "No dog's cannot think." Another consequence of that would be that computer's cannot think. A third would be that if there is a god, it does not think. Otherwise, there is no more basis for believing that a dog can think than that another person can think. Likewise, there is no more basis for believing that a dog cannot think than for believing that a person cannot think. 

Meanings don't come from cosmic process in the manner of Helium. Meanings are constructed by people. is ordinarily the same as because that's what we ordinarily mean by "is ordinarily the same". Occasional experiences of philosophical confusion result from a mistake: That meanings have some existence independent of our use of them and a general consensus among us as a language community. Playing along with the confusion requires us to ignore the subtleties of the consensus: The we don't say that the 's in and are the same in ordinary circumstances. [1] Take two Wittgenstein and call me in the morning. [1] We are ordinarily very clear about the contexts in which we would say that they are, e.g. substring matching.
