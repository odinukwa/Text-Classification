Way too much of a paper trail with a bonus. If have to choose between the bonuses and free paid off, take the free hours off. The days off could be spread even longer. Take halves, come in late, leave early. Chance of getting caught pretty slim. Just keep on DL and don't tell anyone !! Anyone asks, just say its taken care of. Tell them they cut you a check if have to. I'd say Avoid making too much noise. Since boss is getting to bat for you, at least you know HR is the 'bad guy" in this. No sense getting them on your bad side too. If really wanted to get nasty, could go up the chain, to USA Department of Labor (or equivalent). 

Unless there is something big, like you forgot you had a doctor appointment on Thursday, don't change. Heck, even in that case, I'd probably reschedule the doc instead of change interview. Work is work, you know the doctor is going to be there either way. For what it's worth, when I was unemployed, I've told HR people that I was free all day and night 7 days a week for interview. Sounds desperate, but HR people just make schedules, not putting any notes about you begging for a job. 

Forget the law about smoking in a public building for a moment. Even if you are right that he can be fined, bringing that up is going to cause a lot of sore feelings. Nobody appreciates being ratted out to the authorities, no matter how wrong they are, and it should be your last resort. Instead, consider the problem as if there were no legal remedy. I think most people, especially smokers, would consider smoking in a personal office to be reasonable behavior. If he keeps the door shut while smoking, then there shouldn't be enough smoke leaking out to cause problems for the grand majority of people. It's possible you are the only one bothered this, so don't approach him as if he is posing some dire health threat to the entire office. He's not; he's acting in a reasonable way that happens to cause problems for you, and you need to find a solution that is agreeable to you both. I suggest you meet with him at your desk or a conference room. Say something like "I understand you like to smoke in your office, but even small amounts of smoke bother me due to a medical condition." Then suggest a solution that allows him to smoke and you to not have to suffer it. Can you be assigned a desk that's farther away from his office? Can you find someplace to meet other than his office in the future? Can he keep the door shut for at least fifteen minutes after finishing a cigarette and/or open a window? You get the idea. In short, there is likely a solution that will make you both happy. Find it and pitch it to your boss. Do not attack, threaten, or blame him. He's not your adversary; he's someone you need to work with to solve a problem. If you go to him with a cooperative attitude rather than a confrontational one, he is very likely to want to help you. 

I am currently hired as a Warehouse Colleague by a large Logistics company in the UK. After finding out about my technical background, qualifications and hobbies, they seconded me into the IT Department where I went on to become Lead Software Engineer for a very large and successful project. The software was rolled out across our UK sites and then re-branded and used as a "Gift / Perk" for several of our key partners, so it is now being used in 7 very large companies, including supermarkets and a car manufacturer. I wanted to use this experience to get a better job, as I am still officially only a Warehouse Colleague and still only being paid minimum wage, despite programming bespoke software from scratch. (With no possibility of a promotion here as a programmer is a nice extra for the team, rather than a necessity). I used the advice from here that I should write my CV so that it states my official title and then a title that best represents what work I was doing. On my CV I put "Warehouse Colleague (Systems Support / Software Development)" and thought that would be the end of it... I was turned down for a job using this CV, when I contacted the HR Department for the company to enquire why I had been turned down, they said that they had called my current employer and had been told that I was only a Warehouse Picker and had not performed any other roles at the company. At first I believed that this was simply an oversight by our HR, but when I approached them I was told that HR do not keep track of secondment positions and will not inform potential employers of anything that I do during secondment. Officially I am in the warehouse picking stock, so that is all that they will tell anyone. Now I'm stuck. If I can get an interview then I have several documents, emails, letters and printed guide-books for the software, all with my name on as the software developer. As well as several code examples that I know like the back of my hand. Problem is that I can't get an interview because anyone contacting my employer will basically be told that I am lying. Is there any way that I can use my experience on a CV, despite HR shooting it down? Is there any polite way that I can make it clear to potential employers that my current employer will not be helpful? Thank you all for your time, I look forward to your answers. 

When your manager asks you to perform a task and you don't have time to do both that task and everything else you've committed to, tell him that. You can inform him of your workload and still be respectful. Try something like, "Sure boss, I'd love to do X, but I've already committed to do Y and Z, and I don't have time to do all three. Which tasks should I prioritize? Is anyone available to help me?" Then go from there. If you're concerned about future backlash from not doing a task your manager tells you not to do, follow up your conversation with an email. If there are other stakeholders involved (i.e. people other than your manager request your time), copy them on the email or ask your manager to speak with them. If someone asks you to perform a task and your schedule is full, refer them to your manager. Don't be afraid to use your manager as a buffer between you and the people requesting your time; that's part of their job. Don't complain about the work ethics of others. It will make you look whiny, and it's irrelevant anyway. The only thing that matters is your workload and whether it exceeds the amount of work you can do. It's the responsibility of your manager to decide how to deal with you having too much work, and it's also his responsibility to deal with slackers. Don't try to do his job. 

I would suggest not saying much to managers, and 'sand bagging', that is, drag out your work so it takes 8+ hours. If keep bringing it up, or leaving early, they going to wonder why they are paying you full time. Several years ago, I had a similar job at a huge company that liked the color blue a lot, but could get it done in 2 hours. Was pre-internet days, so didn't have much to do. Read newspaper, buy some old high school history books at Goodwill for $1 and see how wording has changed from the 1930s to now, take lot of smoke breaks. Take long lunches. Whatever had to, but was sure to be there at beginning and end of day. 

Yes. Remind them you are not very good at the animation side of things. If you don't have a job now, then a little bit of something is better than a whole lot of nothing. So you get fired... stings a little, but you were looking for a job when got that one. Offer to do contract work for 3/7 that you started until they get replacement. Or something. They may be hiring you because they liked your personality, maybe once you start, they will see you totally rock at 3/7 things, and they will get someone else who is good at the graphics but sucks at rest and you will team up 

You won't like this answer, but you should not seek compensation from your workplace. Consider if you drove a car and it got dinged in the parking lot. Would you expect to have your employer repair the damage? (In case you're unsure, the answer is no.) This is made even worse by parking your bike in a spot not designed or designated for bike parking, and that you know cars frequently get close to. I understand the desire for convenience, and nobody appreciates having their property damaged, but there is no way your employer will pay for it. You will seem whiny and entitled if you even ask. Don't do it. Your only recourse to recoup the damages is to find the person that hit your bike. You can try filing a police report, but if the costs are minimal, they likely won't bother to pursue it. If there is a camera at the front of the building, you could ask security to review it and get you a plate number. If it's a really small company, you could try putting up a notice somewhere asking the person to come forward. You have to be really careful how you word it to not come across as passive aggressive, though. I personally wouldn't bother unless the costs were really high, as it's unlikely anyone will 'fess up to it. To prevent this happening in the future, I suggest you request a designated, safe, and relatively convenient place to park your bike. This is entirely reasonable, especially if they provide parking for cars. Tell your management that you tried to find an existing place to lock up your bike, but your bike got damaged there, and you'd like a safer place to put it in the future. If they don't agree, then you are stuck with the same preventative measure that car owners have to use: park your vehicle somewhere that cars are unlikely to get close enough to damage it. That generally comes at a convenience cost, so you will have to decide if the trade-off is worth it or not. 

I've seen this a few times, as well as been in these relationships myself. Including dating a colleague that I was technically responsible for, since while I was not her manager, her manager was reporting to me at the time. It was heavily frowned upon and resulted in being the sole reason for me being disregarded for a promotion. So if possible, I would highly recommend keeping your relationship strictly out of the office and making sure management don't find out about it. That, of course, has it's own drawbacks and will not hold forever (especially if either of you use social media or have friends inside your place of work). In my contract it did specifically state that personal relationships with colleagues was prohibited to prevent a conflict of interest. While this was brought up when I informed management of my relationship, no punishment was enforced (until of course, they let me know it had dropped me out of the running for a higher position some months later). So from that I would take a safe guess that it's not legally enforceable in the UK, otherwise they would of done something worse (they were not the light-handed type of company). But if in doubt or if you become threatened, seek real legal advice. If you can get away with it, I would suggest showing absolutely zero affection inside the office (strict zero, absolutely not a slight sliver of affection in any way beyond how you would treat anyone else). Then should management come to learn about it, you at least have the recourse that you didn't think to bring it up simply because it does not affect your work or how you behave around any of your colleagues, including your boyfriend/girlfriend. If you show that you can keep your relationship purely outside of the building, they are likely to be uninterested. Also of note, this also means no emails beyond work related subjects... working in IT has taught me that if a company suspects unprofessional behaviour, they tend to check your work email before talking to you about it (and browser history, so going onto hotmail won't work either, as they'll just jump to assumptions). "It doesn't affect my work" falls flat on its face if you're manager thinks/knows you've been emailing. I'm not going to give you any relationship advice, but here's my experience: Work place relationships are hard work. The relationship I mentioned before fell apart after she got a disciplinary for not meeting deadlines, and I refused to "pull strings" to get her out of trouble. If you ever have to choose between professionalism or the relationship, you've just hit a pure lose:lose situation, one that could cost you your job, relationship or both. So please be careful, and good luck to you both!
