Can you? Sure! Should you? Well... You say it's a mountain bike - what kind of riding do you do? If you're mostly doing commuting on smooth roads, you should be able to get away with it through careful riding, avoiding curbs, pot-holes and other harsh knocks. If you're riding off-road on even moderately bumpy terrain, I'd say that's a prescription for a wheel failure which will end up in another accident, and this time it may not be just the wheel that ends up broken. As far as spoke wrenches go, when I last really worked on a wheel, the top of the nipple had a small slot in it where you could use a slotted screwdriver. It appears that they still do: $URL$ $URL$ stolen from Bike Parts Place.com You can remove the tire, tube and rim tape then use your screwdriver in this slot. I'd suggest that when you order your spokes you would want to order either a multi-size spoke wrench or a set of single-size wrenches (I just picked up a Parke Tools multi-size one last night for $10, the set was about $15) as that will make quick tweaks to truing much easier in the future. I'd also suggest ordering a few extra spokes, just to have them on hand should this ever happen to you again. Since it's your rear wheel and that takes the majority of your weight, I'd suggest that you'd want to temporarily replace both of them with spokes from the front. Where from the front you'd want to pull them, I'm not certain - I'd hope someone else will chime in on that. Pulling them from right next to each other increases the weakness at that spot, but makes it easier to maintain true, while pulling from 180° from each other spreads the weakness, but makes it more difficult to true up. As a side note, I'm curious where you are that you've got a bike with 29" wheels - I certainly don't know all there is to know about bikes, but that's a diameter I've not heard of before. 

There are crankarms with multiple attachment points. Obviously this doesn't allow changing leverage on the fly. My own understanding, ojs' post notwithstanding, is that crankarm length should be proportional to femur length, so unless you've got variable-length femurs, there's not much benefit in variable-length crankarms. 

I cleaned my wife's 1999-vintage mountain bike, and because no good deed goes unpunished, I seem to have caused a problem in the process. This bike has a Shimano Deore 9-speed drivetrain with trigger shifters. Starting from the smallest cog, the trigger shifter for the rear derailleur can downshift through the first three gears correctly; after that, it needs to rotate back for the ratcheting mechanism to reset. That's where it goes wrong: the pawl apparently won't engage with the ratchet wheel, and the trigger swings freely. I've been brave enough to remove the housing over the mechanism and blow some compressed air in there, which did not fix the problem. There are enough small parts in there that I'm reluctant to go further without some guidance (if it's possible for a home mechanic to fix at all). I see that I can apparently buy a replacement for about $24, so if the correct answer is "replace it" I won't be too broken up. 

It's difficult to make out in this picture, but I believe the keeper bar on the cage should be forward of the chain. The way to determine whether the chain is threaded correctly is to see whether it drags on the keeper bar when it moves. If it drags, it's threaded wrong. 

I have ridden roads like this, but only in large herds groups (30+ people) where we were able to draft and maintain 30+MPH in 55+MPH traffic. Also, there was a generally agreed upon "they'll have to get us all" mentality that if anyone was hit, the rest would ensure aggressive legal persecution prosecution would ensue. This ride was in the Gainsville, FL area back in the late 80's. It was very nerve-wracking for the first few miles, then it got more comfortable. We were always very conscious of the traffic, and had constant communication through the group of traffic approaching from behind. As I recall, we also had a bit more shoulder. Riding solo, I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole! 

It seems that I'm old (my last good bike had a 5-speed freewheel and shifters mounted on down tube braze-ons - they were indexed, though!), and I've been out of cycling for quite some time. I've seen several references to a "compact crankset" and questions like this one asking about replacing the whole crankset just to change gearing. Back in my day (get off my lawn you meddlin' kids!) I would have (and, occasionally did) simply changed a single chain ring to one with a more or fewer teeth to change the gearing. Why would one now change the complete crankset instead of buying a single new chain ring? Does it bring specific advantages to the table, or are replacement/different size chain rings simply no longer manufactured? (The cynic in me says that means more profit for the manufacturers.) 

This will depend on what kind of conditions you're riding in, what condition your bike is in, etc, but I think these are the basics: 

This sounds like a really bad idea. Training wheels limit your ability to lean into a turn. If you're going fast enough to balance without the training wheels, you're going fast enough that you need to turn by leaning. So you would need training wheels that retract when you get above ~5 mph, and deploy below that speed. Apparently something like this does exist for motorcycles, but I've never heard of anything like it for bicycles. The alternative would be to ride a trike. 

The general idea of "lever drive," or a reciprocating pedal motion instead of a rotary pedal motion precedes even the invention of the modern diamond-frame bicycle--consider the Special Star from 1886. More recently, there was the Facet Biocam, the Alenax, and the Wall Walker. Within the world of reciprocating drivetrains, the String Bike is interesting in its use of materials (dyneema to transmit power) and the ability to vary mechanical advantage on the lever arm (although the Alenax was able to achieve this simply using hub gears). But check out what Jobst Brandt had to say about the Alenax. His basic point is that you're converting reciprocating motion to rotary motion, which is mechanically less efficient. I haven't been able to find any studies of the biomechanics of lever-drive bikes. 

"Efficiency" seems like it should be easy to measure. Power out ÷ Power in. Obviously nothing in life is so easy. Here's a blog post by a randonneur who has compared power output on his recumbent to that on his diamond-frame bike (there are some related posts at the end that are also interesting). He's found that his peak power output is higher on his DF bike, but his calories per mile and his watts per mph are lower on his recumbent. So those are a couple of non-obvious ways to define efficiency that show the recumbent being more efficient. The author also writes about feeling "muscle-limited" on recumbents due to his inability to recruit as many different muscle groups, and "lung-limited" on DF bikes. And there's some interesting discussion in the comments. 

Frankly, it's going to be hard for random strangers on the internet to determine the extent of damage to carbon fiber from a picture. Be upfront with the seller - tell him you're uncomfortable and would like to have a bike shop take a look at it. Be prepared before hand - find a local, reputable shop, explain the situation and ask them if they'll do the inspection & how much they'd charge. Be willing to pay them $20, $30, $50 for their work. For the shop it is probably just a few minutes work to disassemble and inspect. If they determine it's cracked carbon, not just paint, you've saved yourself the purchase price and the potential of an expensive hospital bill. If they say it looks good, you're probably OK, and the few bucks for peace of mind is probably worth it. In any case, don't let the emotion of pursuing a good deal override your gut feeling about it. If you don't think it's safe, pass, no matter how good the deal is. After all, it's your body on the line should it fail on you. 

The one piece seat-stay/chain-stay construction looks like a Hutch* from the early 80's however, having both the left & right side stays made from one bent tube doesn't match up exactly with anything I have looked at while browsing the BMX Museum. It might be something from the late 70s (they only have from 1980 on pictured there). Or it might be a knock-off cheap copy of the Hutch design. That might be a good place to continue your search. Based on the eBay prices of some of these bikes, I'd say you've likely got yourself a valuable project on your hands! *I picked Hutch based on one that was similar looking on eBay that came up in a search for "bicycle gt 4130 cro mo team". 

I think their seatbag products all attach with straps, not clips. It's hard for me to imagine a seatbag that would be incompatible with downtube shifters. The bag you saw might have been from Topeak -- some of their bags have a snap-on design. Nothing wrong with their stuff either. 

Rather than setting your seat height according to a formula, I recommend setting it through experimentation. The rule of thumb is that you should set your seat height so that when one leg is fully extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke, that knee should be almost but not quite straight. You should be able to pedal comfortably without rocking your hips in this position. Note that this height can change based on how much you ride, the fore/aft position of the seat on the seatpost, your age, etc. This is just a starting point--you need to repeatedly fine-tune your seat height to find what works for you. Raising your seat without making any other changes is naturally going to rotate your torso forward so that you carry more weight on your hands, as you've discovered. You may simply get accustomed to this in time. You could also raise your handlebars to rotate your position back. Lots of cyclists (myself included) do wear padded gloves, and it's not a bad idea to try them, but these are more to smooth out shocks transmitted through the handlebars than to redistribute your weight. Either adapting to your position or correcting it is more important. 

Will's answer is correct - this is to provide an identical example when driving: Source: Google Maps If you are headed northbound on State Road 213, the normal course of action is to continue around the left bend on SR213. However, a fair amount of traffic exits SR213 onto County Road 400 E. (I'm not sure why that little spur of road is labeled SR213 - that's not the case & needs to be fixed.) The traffic exiting SR213 onto CR400 E, should indicate they're leaving the main road by using their right turn signal, even though they are actually traveling in a straight line. (I say should because who uses turn signals these days? I know where I'm going, what difference does it make if you know where I'm going? /rant) Since bicycles, at least in the US, are supposed to be road vehicles and follow the rules of the road, you would follow the same logic, whether "exiting" straight onto another road or onto a path/sidewalk/etc. I think your biggest challenge is having people understand why the heck is this guy waving his arm about in the first place. 

Try a shot of graphite or "lock lubricant" in the lock mechanism and jiggle the key for a bit before destroying the lock. It may just be a bit rusty inside. 

I think you're the only one who can determine if they'll be an advantage to you. In general, I'd think the extra position would be an advantage. Even with 4 positions on your standard drop bars, being able to take weight off your hands and put it on your elbows might be a welcome relief, even if it's just for a short period of time.
