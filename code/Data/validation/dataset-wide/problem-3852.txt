It is easy to see that the necessary condition "the sum of any three areas must be bigger than the fourth one" is also sufficient for the existence of such a tetrahedron, in an analogous way as the triangle inequalities. 

For $n\ge m\ge 2$, define $$I(n,m):= \int _0^\infty\dfrac{\text{arcsinh}^nx}{x^m}dx$$ Computer algebra systems say that the indefinite integral can be expressed in terms of polylog functions (of rapidly increasing complexity), but I see no way of doing the limit $\to\infty$. On the other hand, I have found numerically that $I(n,m)$ can (conjecturally always) be written as a rational combination of zeta values, moreover this happens in a rather beautiful way. Here are the values for small $m$ and then what seems to be the general formula. Defining $\bar\zeta(n):=(2^n-1) \zeta(n)$, it seems like $ I(n,2)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \bar\zeta(n)$ $ I(n,4)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac1 {6}[ 4\bar\zeta(n-2)-\bar\zeta(n)]$ $ I(n,6)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac1{120}[ 16\bar\zeta(n-4)-40\bar\zeta(n-2)+9\bar\zeta(n)]$ $ I(n,8)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac1{5040}[ 64\bar\zeta(n-6)-560\bar\zeta(n-4) +1036\bar\zeta(n-2)-225\bar\zeta(n)]$ (you may want to stop here for a moment before reading on and look if the coefficients tell you something already) and $ I(n,3)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \zeta(n-1)$ $ I(n,5)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac13[ \zeta(n-3)-\zeta(n-1)]$ $ I(n,7)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac2{45}[\zeta(n-5)- 5 \zeta(n-3)+4\zeta(n-1)]$ Well, in umbral notation introducing a formal variable $\bar Z$, for even $m=2k$ $$ I(n,2k)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\frac1{(2k-1)!}\bar Z^{n}\prod_{j=-k+1}^{k-2} \left(\frac2{\bar Z}-(2j+1)\right)$$ where each power $\bar Z^r$ is to be replaced by $\bar\zeta (r)$. E.g. for $m=6$, the "zeta polynomial" is related to $16z^4-40z^2+9=(2z-3)(2z-1)(2z+1)(2z+3)$. Likewise for odd $m=2k+3$ (sic to make notation more elegant), $$ I(n,2k+3)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\frac{2^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}Z^{n}\prod_{j=-k}^{k}\left (\frac1{Z}-j\right)$$ where each power $Z^r$ is to be replaced by $\zeta (r)$. E.g. for $m=7$, the "zeta polynomial" is related to $z^5-5z^3+4z=(z-2)(z-1)z(z+1)(z+2)$. We can rewrite the expression for even $m$ as follows to look amazingly similar to the one for odd $m$: $$ I(n,2k+2)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\frac{2^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}\bar Z^{n}\prod_{j=-k+1/2}^{k-1/2} \left(\frac1{\bar Z}-j\right)$$ where in the product $j$ runs over the half-integers. 

On page 2163, the second line, the authors say "therefore ... is exact". I, and some others, believe this is a gap. The authors have been contacted (in 2010) and have not clarified. 

I found what I think is the answer, in a paper by Cutkosky and Srinivasan called "Local fundamental groups of surface singularities in characteristic $p$". They prove, as Corollary 5: Suppose that $(A, m)$ is a complete normal local domain of dimension two, with algebraically closed resicue field $k$ of characteristic zero. (Slightly surprising, given the title of the paper.) Then $\pi_1(\operatorname{Spec} A -m)=0$ if and only if $A$ is smooth over $k$. They say that this gives "an arithmetic proof of the theorem of Mumford and Flenner." The proof apparently uses Flenner's paper, but I don't think it uses Mumford's result. They get an expression for the local fundamental group in terms of a tree, and appeal to Flenner's Theorem 2.7 to know that the group is trivial iff $A$ is smooth. I haven't tried to read that section of Flenner's paper yet, but it seems to be independent of Mumford. 

I am interested in models of intuitionistic linear logic, that is, the logic that you get if you take classical linear logic and restrict the set of operators to $\otimes$, $1$, $\multimap$, $\times$, $\top$, $+$, $0$, and $!$. I know what categorical models of this logic are. However I am looking for something more concrete, something that reflects the interpretation that intuitionistic linear logic is about resources. Intuitionistic linear logic corresponds to a variant of the λ-calculus that cannot only deal with values (which can be duplicated and destroyed at will), but also with resources (which can neither be duplicated nor destroyed by default). The ordinary simply typed λ-calculus can be given a semantics where the meaning of a type is the set of its inhabitants. Can something similar be done for the linear λ-calculus such that the idea of computing with resources is directly expressed? 

For a periodic coloring $C_d(n,k)$, let $D$ be a fundamental domain, i.e. a colored minimal cuboid such that its periodic continuation in all coordinate directions yields the given coloring. Some easy examples, all for $k=2$: 

e.g. the shifts are 8 and 72=9*8 in the first example above, and 3 and 12=4*3 in the second one. (There can also be more than two different shifts.) The minimal period lengths are quite irregular, but it looks like the following holds: 

Obviously such a graph cannot contain a $C_4$. Thus, if in a construction there is an edge $(v_i,w_j)$, the four edges $(v_{i\pm1},w_{j\pm1})$ are excluded. It is clear that $f(n)$ grows linearly with $n$: a trivial lower bound is $f(n)\ge [\frac n2]$, realized by adding the links $(v_{2i},w_{2i})$ for $i=1,\dots,[\frac n2]$. 

Nothing. Assume $R=k$, a field, for specificity. Then $k[x_1]$ is a principal ideal domain, as you know, but $k[x_1,x_2]$ has ideals with unbounded number of generators. Specifically, $(x_1,x_2)^n$ is minimally generated by $n+1$ elements for all $n$. One can get higher rates of growth by adding more variables. 

In general, there are many many more reflexive modules than projective modules. As pointed out in another answer, every second syzygy is reflexive, and not necessarily projective (unless your ring happens to be regular of dimension at most $2$). Thus the converse of that answer is, I think, more interesting. In particular, assume that $R$ is (semi)local. Then there are only finitely many indecomposable projectives. If there are finitely many indecomposable reflexives, then $R$ must have dimension at most $2$, and thus finite Cohen-Macaulay type (which is a very rare condition). The moral is that reflexivity is a (very) much weaker condition than projectivity. 

Note that it is not at all straightforward or even possible to define a fractal for every self-similar integer sequence $a=(a_n)_{n\ge0}$ (self-similar meaning as usual that there is a $k\ge2$ and $\lambda$ such that $a_n=\lambda a_{kn}$). On the other hand, there are also sequences with a fractal-like appearance without being self-similar in the above sense. Question: 

existence of a subword (then the part can be pivoted out of the a-b-plane) more generally, existence of two segments which are collinear in $\mathbb R^3$ (then each of the two remaining paths can be pivoted around this line). existence of four vertices forming a parallelogram which are 'surrounded' by the four subwords (in cyclic order) as illustrated in the left picture: leaving rigid the two blue parts, we can pivot simultaneously the two black parts around an axis parallel to or to (!) in a way that again maintains the orthogonality at each moment. Likewise if the four subwords are (right picture) or . 

Now I wonder what the right adjoint of $F \otimes {-}$ is. I suppose, that it fulfills the following equation (which is a generalization of the equation for exponentials in functor categories): $$(F \multimap G)(x) = \int_{y : I} \prod_{I(x, y)} F(y) \multimap G(y)$$ Is this correct? And if yes, is there a more standard way of representing the right adjoint? 

For every product in a category, there exists an operation $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$ that turns morphisms $f : C \to A$ and $g : C \to B$ into morphisms $\langle f, g\rangle : C \to A \times B$. How are this operation and its results usually called? Calling $\langle f, g\rangle$ the product of $f$ and $g$ does not make sense to me, since I would expect $f \times g$ to be the product of the two morphisms. Furthermore there is the generalisation of binary products in the form of arbitrary products $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ for families $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ of objects. These products have, of course, variants of the $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$-operator. What is the usual notation for these variants? So far, I wrote $\langle\{f_i\}_{i \in I}\rangle : C \to \prod_{i \in I} A_i$ for families of morphisms $f_i : C \to A_i$. Is this standard? 

The first counterexample given by @joro gives rise to the following family $G_k$ of graphs with $\rho(G_k)=k$ : $G_k$ has $n=4k+3$ vertices numbered $0,1,\dots,n-1$ forming a H-cycle (imagine a regular n-gon embedded such that the vertex $2k+1$ is on the bottom), plus the ‘horizontal’ chords $(2j-1,4k+3-2j)$ for $j=1,...,k$ (call their set $B$) and the other chords $(j,2k+1+j)$ for $j=0,...,2k+1$. It is not hard to see that $(4k+2,0)$ is an a-edge. As the graph without this edge and without $B$ is bipartite, all edges of $B$ must be b-edges. It remains to check that for each other edge, there is a H-cycle that doesn’t contain it. For the second question, as @Martin Tancer and @nvcleemp have pointed aout, $\rho(G)\le1/2$ for cubic graphs. The following construction comes arbitrarily close to $1/2$ : For $n=2k$, start with a H-cycle $0,...,2k-1,0$ and add the ‘horizontal’ chords $(j,2k-j)$ for $j=1,...,k-1$ and the ‘vertical’ chord $(0,k)$. Replace the vertex $k$ with an instance of $P$ that blocks the vertical chord. Then it is easy to see (starting at the vertex $0$) that the horizontal chords cannot be part of a H-cycle. So this graph has $a(G)=2k+7$ (the original cycle plus 7 inner edges of $P$) and $b(G)=k+1$ (the horizontal chords plus 2 inner edges of $P$). So both original questions are answered, thanks to your input. Remains the interesting question raised by joro what can be said about $\rho(G)$ for 4-regular graphs. 

The McKay correspondence mentioned in Hailong's and Mike's answers extends to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over the invariant rings $R=k[x,y]^G$, where $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL(2,k)$ (with $|G|$ invertible in $k$). In particular (Herzog) all such subrings have only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable MCM modules, that is, they have finite CM type. The converse is true in characteristic zero -- that a two-dimensional complete normal domain over $\mathbb{C}$ of finite CM type is a ring of invariants -- by a result of Auslander. The case $G \subset SL(2,k)$ corresponds to $R$ being Gorenstein, and in particular a hypersurface -- namely the ADE hypersurfaces listed in Mike's answer. The correspondence between the irreducible representations of $G$ and the components of the exceptional fiber extends to include the irreducible MCM modules, and the McKay quiver (aka Dynkin diagram) is the same as the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver. The modules are directly connected to the irreps by Auslander, and directly connected to the components of the fiber by Gonzales-Sprinberg--Verdier and Artin--Verdier, extended to the non-Gorenstein case by Esnault and Wunram. Most of this is in the current draft of my notes with Roger Wiegand on MCM modules, chapters 4, 5, and 6. (Ignore the geometry in Chapter 5 -- it's riddled with errors and I'm currently rewriting it. Or you're welcome to point out errors I might not have noticed yet.) The question of what happens to the Auslander-Reiten-McKay correspondence for $G \not\subset SL(2)$ is addressed in some recent papers of Iyama and Wemyss. (You only get some of the indecomposable MCMs, the so-called special ones.) 

As suggested in Neil Strickland's comment, the claim seems to hold indeed for $n=k$. Inspection shows that the characteristic polynomial of the product can be written simply as $$\det(x-A_1\cdot ...\cdot A_n)=x^n-\sum_{i=1}^n (x-1)^{i-1} x^{n-i}s_i,$$ where $s_i$ is the $i$-th symmetric function of $a_1,…,a_n$. The proof of this should not be hard using some kind of induction. E.g. for $n=4$, in expanded form it is $$x^4-(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)x^3+(s_2+2s_3+3s_4)x^2-(s_3+3s_4)x+s_4.$$ 

Start with two $n$-circles $(v_1\cdots v_n)$ and $(w_1\cdots w_n)$ of vertice sets $V$ and $W$, where $n\ge 5$. Add a number of vertex-disjoint edges between $V$ and $W$ (thus no chords) in a way that the resulting graph is still non-Hamiltonian. What is the maximum number $f(n)$ of such edges (let us call them links) that can be added? Equivalently:
