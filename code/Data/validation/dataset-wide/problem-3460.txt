Here are two methods. First method: the substitution can be made by inverting $f$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous, $f^{-1}$ is well-defined. The constraint can therefore be written \begin{equation*} x = f^{-1}\Big(\dfrac{c-(1-P)f(y)}{P}\Big) \end{equation*} The objective becomes \begin{equation*} \max_{y \geq 0}{P \Big[a-f^{-1}\Big(\dfrac{c-(1-P)f(y)}{P}\Big)\Big]+(1-P) (b-y)} \end{equation*} The derivative of this expression with respect to $y$ equals \begin{align*} & (1-P) f'(y) (f^{-1})^{'}(\dfrac{c-(1-P)f(y)}{P})-(1-P) \\ = & (1-P) \dfrac{f'(y)}{f^{'} \circ f^{-1}(\dfrac{c-(1-P)f(y)}{P})}-(1-P) \\ & = (1-P) (\dfrac{f'(y)}{f'(x)}-1) \end{align*} And thus $f'(y^{*})=f'(x^{*})$ at the optimum. Second method: since $f$ is invertible, we can do a change in variables and define $w=f(x)$ and $z=f(y)$. The problem then becomes \begin{equation*} \max_{w \geq 0, z\geq 0}{P(a-f^{-1}(w))+(1-P)(b-f^{-1}(z))} \end{equation*} subject to \begin{equation*} P w +(1-P)z=c \end{equation*} Substituing $w=(c-(1-P)z)/P$ in the problem delivers \begin{equation*} \max_{z\geq 0}{P(a-f^{-1}(\dfrac{c-(1-P)z}{P})+(1-P)(b-f^{-1}(z))} \end{equation*} Differentiating with respect to $z$ yields the same solution. 

We need to prove that $mx \succeq 0$ for any $m \in \mathbb{N}$. This part can itself be proved by induction on $m$. It is trivial for $m=0$ and $m=1$. If the property holds for $m$, then \begin{equation*} (m+1)x = mx +x \succeq mx + 0 \text{ since } x \succeq 0 \end{equation*} Therefore $(m+1)x \succeq mx$, and since $mx \succeq 0$ by the induction hypothesis, by transitivity we obtain $(m+1)x \succeq 0$: the result holds for $m+1$. This proves the result for $m \in \mathbb{N}, n=0$. 

We do not need the Lagrangian approach to solve your maximization problem. We do not need the assumption that $x'-x=\frac{1}{p(a')-p(a)}$ either. The condition $x'-w'=x-w$ is not necessarily satisfied for the optimal contract. 

Labour unions are pushing for wage increase but what is maximal theoretically possible wage increase here and now - without restructuring production, processes and without introduction of new technologies? As far as I can imagine then the decrease of dividend (profit) is the only possible source of wage increase. So - how much wages (in percentage terms) can theoretically be increased if profit is reduced to 0% from invested capital? On can start the calculations with estimating the average wage share in the expenses of average company and go on... Of course - another source of increase of lowest wages is the redistribution of the wages, lowering highest wages in enterprise and there can be great opportunities. 

So - my question is - how economics and policy planning is responding to these trend. Are there research trends, topics, journals, important monographs with such perspective? I feel that the current developments put the developed nations in the situation that is somehow similar to developing countries - in need to increase competitiveness and in need to correct social issues raised by unequal social development. So - these topics should be researched. I know that I have raised many different topics in my question, but my aim is not to receive separate answer on any of those topics. My aim is to get the name and references to the research trend which answers those questions. 

What you are saying is that the marginal utility of one additional good (car, or coconut) decreases and tends to zero. I believe everyone agrees with that. The reason why scarcity matters is not that people can't be satisfied with a finite consumption, but that most individuals currently consume below their satiation level and would be happier with one additional unit. Most people would prefer a bigger house, a more luxurious car, more clothes, etc., even if they would finally be satisfied with some finite level. Regarding your observation "Can we really not ramp up production to facilitate this wish?", the answer is no: it is still too costly to produce cars, houses, clothes etc. to accommodate everyone's wishes. If we were able to produce costlessly the amount of goods required to satisfy everyone's satiation level, the problem of scarcity would be solved (and economics would disappear as a science), but we are clearly far from this situation. 

When she chooses the bundle (6,6) when the prices are (6,7), she spends \begin{equation*} 6*6+6*7=78 \end{equation*} The total price of the bundle (10,0) given this price system is \begin{equation*} 10*6+0*7=60<78 \end{equation*} Therefore she could afford the bundle (10,0) if she wanted to. The fact that she chooses (6,6) reveals that she prefers (6,6) to (10,0). Given the price system (5,5), when she chooses the bundle (10,0) she spends \begin{equation*} 10*5+0*5=50 \end{equation*} And the price of the bundle (6,6) would be \begin{equation*} 6*5+6*5=60 \end{equation*} Therefore (6,6) is not necessarily affordable if her budget is comprised between 50 and 59. This is why (10,0) is not revealed preferred to (6,6) in that case, and thus there is no evidence that she violates WARP. 

Contrary to the common view, the physics is all about models, there are no such thing as law of nature, because every physical law has its applicability range and therefore all of laws as models. But any physical law derives from one principle - $URL$ - any particle theroy (there are hundreds of them) is written as the model Lagrangian and then variational principle is applied to arrive at dynamical equations and observable quantities that can be corroborated in experiments. My question is - is there similar approaches, theories, most general models in economics from which every other model or economic law can be applied. If there are such models, then the automation of economics can be achieved (assuming that the automation of mathematics will be completed, e.g. with project $URL$ I have heard definition - the economics is a tuple <...> but I can not remember the book or article or the content of this tuple. Usually such tuples contain t]general mathematical objects: sets of agents with preference functions, set of interaction mechanisms (market system, competition patterns (monopoly etc.)), sets of external shocks (endogeneous factors) and so on... I am seeking more for literature references, trends, keywords, not exhaustive answer. I can further research question by my own, but I should be informed from where to start my efforts. Macroeconomics can (and should) be derived from the microeconomics, therefore I am seeking the model that states first principles - general microeconomic model (from which the general macro models could also be derived in the best case). 

This assumption is usually considered as reasonable from a normative perspective. For instance, consider the following situations: 

The first sentence means that Tommy's mother's utility function over a bundle $(x,y)$ equals \begin{equation*} u(2,7)-u(x,y)=|x-2|+|y-7| \end{equation*} since she measures the disutility of this bundle with respect to the most preferred one by the "sum of the absolute values of the differences". Therefore the utility that she associates with the point $(4,5)$ equals \begin{equation*} u(4,5)=u(2,7)-(2+2)=u(2,7)-4 \end{equation*} You are asked to find the indifference curve that passes through the point $(4,5)$, i.e. the set of bundles $(x,y)$ that satisfy \begin{equation*} u(x,y)=u(4,5) \end{equation*} which you can write \begin{equation*} u(2,7)-u(x,y)=u(2,7)-u(4,5)=4 \end{equation*} The question is therefore: which of the options a), b), c), d) (if any) contain only bundles $(x,y)$ such that $u(2,7)-u(x,y)=4$? You simply have to compute $u(2,7)-u(x,y)$ for all the proposed bundles, given the formula above, and check whether the value equals 4 or not. 

where $m \geq 2$. I leave it to you to check that $a$ is selected by the plurality rule, $b$ by the simple run-off, $c$ by the elimination rule and $d$ by the Borda procedure. Now, let us prove that $n>3$. The cases $n=1$ and $n=2$ are trivial, so let us assume $n=3$ and write $v_1,v_2,v_3$ for the number of voters in the three voter profiles. Without loss of generality, let us assume that $v_1 \geq v_2 \geq v_3$, that $a$ is selected by the plurality rule, that $b$ is selected by the run-off election, that $c$ is selected by the elimination rule and that $d$ is selected by the Borda count. The outcome of the plurality rule shows that $a$ is most preferred by voters of group 1 (since it wins with no ties). If $a$ were also preferred by voters of group 2, $a$ would win the run-off election, which is a contradiction. Thus $a$ is most preferred by voters of group 1, $b$ is most preferred by voters of group 2, and $v_1>v_2 \geq v_3$, the latter inequality being strict if $b$ is not most preferred by voters of group 3. But then it is clear that both $a$ and $b$ survive the first two rounds of the elimination rule, i.e. that $c$ and $d$ are eliminated, which is a contradiction. 

Are there research (and stories more broadly) about professional open source companies? To what types of products their are appropriate, what licensing schemes to choose? How to managed patents and IP? How to motivate and build HR and how to attract volunteer community? How to involve academia in the project? How to organise ownership and how to achieve profitability? What is the past performance of the professional open source companies - what success stories and what failures, what are lessons learned? This question seems to be quite broad, but the subject is nascent and therefore narrow. That is why this question is focused and narrow as well. 

In our country we have 25% personal income tax on labour, 15% corporate tax on corporations and 10% personal income tax on income from capital (e.g. dividends). Pundits in our country are saying that we have flat tax rate across all types of income, because - they are saying - 15% corporate tax and 10% capital income tax amounts to the 25% tax on the income from the capital. Are their analysis correct? This question leads to the following question - does return in capital (after taxes) depneds on the corporate tax rate? What empirical analysis and models are saying about this? From the one hand - it seems that corporate tax have impact on the gains after corporate tax from the other hand - maybe free market reprices the capital in such manner that the return on capital (after corporate tax) does not depend on the corporate tax rate? Does the tax system of our country is just, normal, appropriate and similar to for the developed Western democracy country? I feel that to speak about flat (equal) taxation we should have 25% tax on all the types of income and we should not take into account the corporate tax when considering personal income tax. How this analysis proceeds in Western democracies? Or should we speak about price/earning share ratio as the most sensible measure of return on capital - does this ratio depend on the corporate tax? 

I understand the mathematical proof and the graphical illustration behind this property ($EV>CV$ for the variation in the price of a normal good), but I still do not understand the economic intuition. Can anyone explain, in intuitive terms, why the comparison between $EV$ and $CV$ is given by the sign of the wealth effects? Edit: there seems to be different definitions of $EV$ and $CV$. Here are the ones that I use. Following a change in price from $p^{0}$ to $p^{1}$, the income being fixed at $w$, $EV$ is defined by \begin{equation*} v(p^{0},w+EV) = v(p^{1},w) \end{equation*} whereas $CV$ is defined by \begin{equation*} v(p^{0},w) = v(p^{1},w-CV). \end{equation*} For these definitions, if I am not mistaken, if the good is normal, then $EV>CV>0$ for a price decrease and $0>EV>CV$ for a price increase. 

Regarding your first question, the space on which you can apply Lebesgue's theorem is $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$. The relevant $\sigma$-algebra is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra and the integration corresponds to the Lebesgue measure. Formally, with your notation, the function $f_m$ is defined on vectors $x=(x_1,\cdots,x_N)$ by \begin{equation*} f_m(x_1,\cdots,x_N) = u(\sum_{n}{\alpha_n^m x_n}) \end{equation*} Regarding your second question, it seems to me that constructing a counter-example would be difficult and tedious. Proofs of continuity are rarely done that way. You might ask your teacher what kind of argument he has in mind. A possibility that you might wish to explore is to go back to the definition of continuity. Basically, you want to show that: \begin{equation*} \forall \alpha, \forall \epsilon>0, \exists \delta>0 \text{ such that } \|\alpha-\beta\|<\delta \Rightarrow \|U(\alpha)-U(\beta)\|<\epsilon \end{equation*} You can try to replace $U(\alpha)$ and $U(\beta)$ by their expression and manipulate the resulting integral. But this essentially boils down to proving Lebesgue's convergence theorem again : this solution is therefore not going to be simpler, but it might help you to understand what is behind this result. 

Utility function is great theoretical concept but is it used in customer data analysis or in building customer profile (e.g. from Big data or cash register/checkout data, ecommerce history) or in predicting future sales and future proposals that customers can be eager to accept? If utility function is not used in these areas what other tools (conceptually similar to utility function) is used in customer data analysis? Are there attempts to discover customer goals, intentions and personality, build utility function from these conceptually high level data and use such framework in sales prediction or modelling the desirable features of new product? I have read about behavioral economics but it have strong focus on stock market modelling and little is said about consumer goods and services. 

Is there non-partisan (academically accepted) theory of intrinsic value of labour? Everyday observations say that market prices do not reflect the true value of labour for some professions. E.g. scientists who work in fundamental science contributes greatly to the development of society and industries (e.g. Google Page Rank algorithm works due to Frobenius-Perron theorem), nevertheless they receive very modest pay even in developed countries. Great artists can be neglected during their lifetime but their art can be worth millions some years later. And even more - scientists sometimes make discoveries that can be acknowledged only centuries later. E.g. art scientists and musicologs are among the lowest paid professions (their pay can sometimes be equal to shop assitants' pay) but their theories about aesthetics can be of crucial importance now that development of artificial (general) intelligence and computational creativity requires philosophical and aesthetical answers on the questions "what is art?", "what is valuable art?", "what is semantics of art?". And even more. Theologians are other very poorly paid profession but advent of artificial intelligence requires first-principle theories about norms governing robots and artificially intelligent agents. And computational theology and applied philosophy can provide the basic answers, e.g. what self-driving cars should do in morally conflicting situations. So - how can we estimate the true value of labour and should we acknowledge that market price not always capture the true value of labour? Wiki has some entries about Marx theory of labour value, but I am seeking some non-partisan and widely accepted theory. 

If $x=(1,1)$, $y=(0,1)$ and $z=(0,0)$, we have $x \succ y \succ z$. In addition, any $\lambda>0$ is such that $\lambda x + (1-\lambda) z \succ y$. Thus assumption 2. is not valid, and the conclusion of the theorem (existence of a utility representation) is not valid either. 

I guess the discount holds for the 100 first units of food even if she buys more than 100. Therefore the new budget line is \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} & 200 = 0.2 F + 2C \text{ if } F < 100 \\ & 200 = 0.2 \times 100 + F-100+2C \text{ otherwise } \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} which is continuous. 

No, weak orderings are not mutually exclusive, but strict orderings are, exactly as for the usual comparison of real numbers: you can have $x \geq y$ and $y \geq x$ (if $x=y$), but $x>y$ and $y>x$ are incompatible with each other. The weak orderings $A \succeq B$ and $B \succeq A$ mean that the decision-maker is indifferent between $A$ and $B$: he might therefore choose any of these options indifferently. 

In the expected utility theory we usually consider these two situations as equivalent since the probability distribution over the final outcomes (the color of the ball) is the same: there is a 50% chance that a blue ball is selected, and a 50% chance that a red ball is selected. Therefore from a theoretical perspective it is hard to think of any reason why people would strictly prefer one situation to another. However, empirically a substantial fraction of people exhibits a strict preference for the situation A rather than the situation B, for instance in this paper. According to my experience, most researchers are inclined to see this behavior as a mistake that reflects some difficulties with the computations of probabilities. Interestingly, this behavior is associated with ambiguity aversion, which is also sometimes considered as an anomaly. However, this is largely a matter of interpretation and other researchers prefer not to make any normative judgment on this behavior, as a matter of principle, and prefer instead to try to find rational explanations for it. It is for instance sometimes argued that the additional layer of uncertainty which is added in situation B would be a legitimate reason for risk-averse individuals to strictly prefer situation A.
