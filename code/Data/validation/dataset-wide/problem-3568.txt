Regarding weight, a different chapter examines a fat storage enzyme HSD and its connection to cortisol. It's not quite so simple as saying that more cortisol directly causes more HSD, but there is a more complex relationship. HSD in your cells amplifies their exposure to cortisol and other stress hormones, which results in more weight gain. 

Typically a "good carb" indicates that the food has nutrients and is absorbed into the bloodstream slowly. 

A mixed grip is stronger and allows for heavier weight to be held. This is generally the "default" grip for deadlifts and prevents grip from being the limiting factor in terms of how much weight can be lifted. (Note that it is a good idea to switch the mixed grip for even development.) An overhand grip is weaker overall, but can be used to strengthen your grip assembly and for similar "tuning" work. 

This video is pretty good at quickly demonstrating proper hanging deadlift form, and a regular deadlift is essentially the same except that a rep starts and ends on the floor instead of at the top of the lift. 

I've never had similar problems in my Vibrams, but then I wash them after almost every use (if I did something like running to get sweaty - I also love them for weightlifting which doesn't cause me to sweat nearly as much). Think of it this way: you're wearing them directly against your skin and they'll be in contact with any sweat or dampness. Would you keep re-wearing the same pair of socks for several days without washing them?

I think the real question is how to do curls with rings. From there, forearm rotation will refine these to hammer curls. This video illustrates the technique; I'll attempt to describe it in words for future-proofing: 

According to the Nutrition and Bodyweight section in chapter 8, you should stay on the recommended nutrition program (admittedly a bit vague; I wish he had devoted more book space to this topic) for at least 3-4 months. 

Scale weight doesn't tell you much, but if your bodyfat isn't decreasing then you should cut carbs while maintaining a decent caloric load.The author's contention is that your body fat will normalize naturally if you're doing the program. He would say if you aren't making serious strength gains and losing bodyfat... then YNDTP (you're not doing the program). 

Density: Your muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. Extra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue. Utilization: The average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. 

Update: I've selected an answer, which I think addresses my issue well, but I'd like to add a couple additional items of note that I've tried (neither seemed to affect my performance) in case anyone else follows in my footsteps: 

Hands facing away tends to focus on your back and lats. Hands facing toward you emphasizes the biceps. As far as which to use when... that depends on what you are trying to accomplish with that workout. Obviously, the two still use a lot of the same muscle groups so take that into account if you're going to use both. 

I use creatine and L-glutamine for my workouts, typically taking the L-glutamine about an hour before my workout, and creatine immediately after. (I don't take them together because I understand they compete for receptors, limiting absorption). I also try to keep the load up by taking creatine first thing in the morning, and L-glutamine last thing before bed regardless of whether I worked out that day. My question is: do I need to take these supplements on rest days in order to maintain my "load"? Should I be taking two servings* of each on rest days instead of just one? Are the daily servings unnecessary? *A serving for me is typically a heaping spoonful dissolved in water or cold tea (I know that a sugary drink would help absorption, but I'm not willing to take the downside of the sugar). 

I don't see any reason to avoid the egg yolks; they have just as much protein as the whites (see nutrition facts in @Uw Concept's answer). The avoidance of egg yolks in almost every case stems back to the (false) theory that eating egg yolks damages one's blood cholesterol profile. In reality, egg yolks have a lot of nutrients and just as much protein as a white. 

According to Practical Programming (p. 148) the continuum of adaption persistence (from most persistent to least persistent) is: 

Many creatine distributors, health forums, etc. recommend avoiding mixing creatine with citrus juices, as supposedly the citric acid could combine with the creatine to produce creatinine, which isn't a useful substance for strength training and bodybuilding. However, it occurs to me that stomach acid is stronger and more acidic than any juice that one is likely to drink. So, is there something specific about citric acid and creatine that would not apply to stomach acid, or is the creatine/citrus warning a myth? 

I would think that if they're safe from rain, they're safe from snow. The important thing is to keep them dry so they don't rust. If your rain cover can accomplish this already, I can't see what damage snow could do; certainly they aren't sensitive to temperature or the weight of snow on top. 

I'd like to offer a dissenting opinion. I find that having a training partner (friend or otherwise) makes me at least partially out of control of my own timing. I can't e.g. just leap onto the equipment when I feel ready or when the stopwatch goes off if my partner hasn't finished. Sometimes it doesn't matter, but for some workouts timing can be crucial, and having to work with someone else potentially "in the way" and being responsible for that person's safety and motivation adds an extra challenge. 

If your goal is to score well on this test, then the best way to prepare is to practice this exact exercise. Adaptation (including VO2Max) is very specific, and building up your VO2Max at some other exercise (like distance running or spinning) is going to be less efficient and less targeted. I suggest regular training sessions doing the exact "beep test" (a shuttle run, I gather). This test is typically done indoors anyway, so no issue with winter weather. 

Instead of trying to do a special exercise just for grip strength, work it into whatever other exercises you do by squeezing the bar as hard as you can. Not only will this increase your grip strength, but it will help you create more body tension so that you can lift more and get more benefit from each workout. 

Your teacher is correct: aerobic conditioning is specific and practice running will make you a better runner, but won't necessarily do much for your swimming. For one thing, running doesn't help you adapt more efficiently to the movements required by swimming. Furthermore, cardiovascular fitness is specific at the cellular level; it's not a systemic thing per conventional wisdom. Body By Science (p. 40) reports on one salient study: 

Update: The comment thread has indicated a desire for "proof" (pedants! :-) ), so here is some reference information and some reasoning built on top of that in support of the above hypothesis. First, the amount of fluid in the stomach is positively correlated with the rate of gastric emptying. It so happens that 30 minutes is an approximate inflection point in the gastric emptying of both a solid and liquid meal, per the chart below (same source). 

The Four Hour Body examines a couple "protocols" for increasing testosterone, albeit with the goal for increased sexual performance rather than muscle development: 

I had a particularly effective HIT weight training workout today, and after two sets I was so gassed and queasy that I had to lay down on the bench for a few minutes to let everything settle down. I hadn't just eaten or drank, and while my heart was racing I don't think it was that high and my breathing was still under control (although certainly I was short of breath). I recalled a section addressing this from the Body By Science Question and Answer Book (p. 237-240), and from that I'd like to add one more potential cause to @Ivo's list. 

I wouldn't use any Vibrams for cement. They are intended to simulate "natural" running, but there's nothing natural about cement. If you're going to run on cement, just get a regular pair of running shoes with nice padded soles and save the Vibrams for the trail. 

This premise is incorrect. While an elite lifter in a lighter weight class may indeed outlift a heavier less-experienced lifter, with similarly-experienced lifters there is a correlation and heavier classes outlift lighter classes. Take a look, for example, at world records - notice how the records categorically go up with the weight classes. Systems such as the Wilks Coefficient have been developed to allow apples-to-apples comparisons between lifters in different weight classes, effectively handicapping heavier lifters to account for their natural advantage. 

You can buy dumbbell magnets to attach to the head of the dumbbells. I've typically seen 1.25lb magnets, though I suppose you can probably find 2.5 lb magnets as well. 

Assuming that your test is in the fairly near future, you aren't going to be able to do much for your body fat percentage (i.e. the skin-fold test) or your general strength and conditioning. However, the body responds to very specific training. By far the best bang-for-the buck would be to simply practice stages 2-5 as closely to the testing conditions as you can. Muscle memory will go a long way towards improved results - even a few runs through the test will make a difference. That way you aren't learning the movements while being tested. I would also suggest recording results from your self tests so that you can see where you are improving, and how far away you are from passing marks (if you know what these are). If you don't know what passing marks are, you may want to focus on those stages which are improving the fastest, since those are where you have quick, easy gains. 

Note: I'd like to keep answers focused on recovery techniques within the parameters of two workouts in the same day, and not address the motivation for doing this workout plan. I'll provide my personal motivation for choosing this schedule, but I don't think the answers should be specific to this. I'm currently doing a weekly Texas cycle, and my "work day" is long (and intense), including 6-8 work sets each of squat, deadlift, bench press, and press (a new addition). Splitting this up is easier on my energy and intensity level, my focus and my schedule. A split day seems to be common among "pros" but isn't usually recommended for the rest of us, since we don't have the luxury of spending the whole day at the gym. I happen to work at home with flexible hours and have a home gym, so I can actually do this. 

If you're a beginner, you may be able to lose some weight and gain some muscle at the same time if you eat and exercise correctly. However, once past the novice stage you'll find that it becomes very difficult to gain muscle and lose fat simultaneously and you end up having to choose one or the other. Bodybuilders call these cycles "cutting" and "bulking". I would suggest first working on gaining muscle, which will help you to burn fat over the long run, and then switching to a cut/diet after you've made some progress with muscle gain. Starting Strength (read the book as your primary resource, then peruse the forums) is an excellent program.
