Protectionism and privacy An early law says that each human being must own a robot before any organization can. The human being receives the wages that the robot earns. Also, any extra robots cannot start doing jobs until the individual-owned robots are fully employed. The police unions negotiate an extra protection for their members. All actual law enforcement activities like arrests and interrogations must be conducted by humans. Robots can do paperwork, fetch coffee, record crime scenes, and disarm bombs or weapon-using opponents. In an agreement supported both by police unions and by privacy advocates, robots are restricted from collecting evidence before a crime. Otherwise, police could just have a robot follow and surveil each human being. The evidence from robots before a crime is committed isn't usable as evidence as an extension of precedents like United States v. Antoine Jones and Torrey Dale Grady v. North Carolina. So any proactive policing, like a foot or car patrol, must be done by a human. The basic idea is that mechanical surveillance must be limited by human capabilities to avoid violation of the fourth amendment. So while robots can assist, only things witnessed by a human may be used as evidence. This is somewhat US-centric but allows for a path for a society. You just need some of the same legal precedents as actually happened in the United States (US) to be extended in this way. 

Poison Ignoring the inability of a medieval army to attack Everest (I'm assuming that Everest was an exaggeration and the actual mountain is feasible), your fairies would have to use poison to defend themselves. Four humans per fairy means that the fairies have to be more effective individually than humans. Presumably a medieval army could produce decent helmets to protect faces. So unless the fairies are ridiculously fast, the humans could swat them out of the sky. The fairies need to be extremely effective with their attacks and they can't rely on precise targeting of vulnerable areas. The only real option in pitched battle would be poison. If the fairy can get within contact range, he or she applies a small amount of concentrated poison. This should be within their weight bearing capacity. A sudden snipe attack from an odd direction could be devastating. Target the rope Assuming that there is climbing involved, the humans will be using a lot of rope. Cut it; fray it; burn it. Occasionally this will precipitate a fall. Hopefully the falls will be as dangerous to the humans as attacking is for the fairies. Concentrate your forces It's hard to climb too close, so the humans will be spread across the face of the mountain. The fairies are smaller and should be able to concentrate their forces. So the poison carrying fairies will harass those at the top and the bottom while the burning/cutting fairies will concentrate on the rope. Even though the fairies are outnumbered overall, they can still concentrate more (of their smaller troops) at any particular location. Attacking while a human is bringing up the first rope or shortly after the initial success would be important. If there are too many people there, they can defend the top of the rope better. If there is only one, then the fairies can release the rope and force the humans to send another climber. Use the distance The fairies should start attacking at the bottom, but they shouldn't worry too much about initial success. It's not a real problem for the humans to get half way up the mountain. So be most careful when the humans are farthest away. Look for opportunities to inflict casualties with low risk. Note that the humans can afford to lose four soldiers for every fairy warrior. Make sure that your attacks are more effective than that. The more spread out the human soldiers are, the easier it will be to attack effectively. The fairies should pace themselves. Maintain the constant threat of attack so that the humans need to waste energy defending against them. But limit most of the actual attacks to the most vulnerable sites. A single climber with no defenders above is most vulnerable. Use sabotage to start fires during night attacks. So the humans have to waste time bringing up fuel for visibility. Cut the climbing ropes at night to slow the troops. Look for that vulnerable member who just wandered into the bushes to take a leak. Fake an attack one place to draw defenders from the place where you'll actually attack. Many attacks will be more annoying than damaging. That's all right. Annoyed people take dangerous short cuts that leave them vulnerable. Also, the distance means that slowing the army down is useful in and of itself. A mountain is hard to supply. The more people devoted to supplies and defending against night attacks, the fewer actually climbing the mountain. Assassinate the king If the biggest obstacle to peace is the king being unreasonable, get rid of the king. This would be the method with the fewest casualties (conceivably as low as one). Of course, they may not realize that it's the king that's the problem. Also, an actual attack on the king may involve the fairies taking heavy casualties. 

Some approaches that come to mind. Overrun it. Bring in so many ships that the stations can't cover all of them. Blow up the computer. A swarm of missiles should overcome its defenses. No more computer, no more blockade. Slip a ringer into the crew of the supply ship. Put a bomb on the computer's station and blow it after the ship leaves. Replace all the personnel of a supply ship and take over the computer station. Put poison in the supply ship food. Get someone on the supply ship sick with something that takes a long time to develop. Stop all the supply ships. At the source if you can. Or blockade the blockade. Chase the computer station closer to the planet and allow the fortress to get rid of it. Throw a meteor shower at it. Cheap, because you can use local materials. One ship can start a whole lot of fragments on the move. Economics The biggest problem is that the blockade is going to be expensive. Red has to buy a whole swarm of space stations. Why can't Blue just buy more ships and outgun them? This is inherently cheaper because Blue only needs the ships for a brief period of time. Red has to outlast Blue throughout the whole process. Red has to maintain the whole structure. If Blue destroys part of it, then Red has to replace it. Meanwhile, if Blue destroys the computer, they don't care if Red destroys all but one ship. They can resume shipments. Blue offers Orange unobtainium if it breaks the blockade. Orange attacks the blockade but all its ships are destroyed. Red loses some of its blockade. But Blue still has all of its unobtainium and fortress. Blue allies with Green. Green can launch a whole new attack, because the prize is the same. Green overwhelms Red, which is weaker after the Orange attack.
