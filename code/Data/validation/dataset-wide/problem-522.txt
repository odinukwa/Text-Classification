I got a spare inner tube with my bike, which is good. I checked how it was packed and found it was sticking somewhat when I pulled it out of the box, which I can only imagine is bad. Would it be an idea to put someething on the tube for storage, talcum powder maybe? 

I used to cycle a lot, and decided to try taking it back up after last year's Olympics. But it feels like almost every time I try to go out for a ride I nearly get taken out by someone passing far too close and giving no warning. As I'm partially sighted this is particularly terrifying. I can spot things ahead of me with plenty of time to avoid nasty incidents if I keep my concentration up, but that leaves me less aware of what's going on behind me, and I can't see well enough to pick out number plates if I need to report someone. I also rely on hearing to detect cars coming up but when the traffic is heavier I can't pick out individual cars over the general background roar of traffic. I'm in a full time job and pay my taxes just like everyone else, I've every right to be on the road. But drivers, either through ignorance or malice are making me feel very unwelcome on the roads. The idea of quitting to me is galling because like I said, I have every right to be on the road, and I can see well enough to avoid getting into trouble provided the people coming up behind me don't act like morons. But I also don't want to end up dead. Have you got any advice for me? I live in the Greater Manchester area 

Tire width has a large impact on bike performance but should be considered alongside tire qualities such as suppleness and proper inflation. 

All that said, most modern bars have some visible demarcations on either side of the clamp area that makes eyeballing and/or measuring to the left and right of the stem pretty easy, without all this silliness. 

Use masking tape to secure a ruler (meter/yard stick) such that you can determine a precise midpoint measurement at the center. Tie a length of string to this midpoint, and hang a weight at the end of the string. Place the drop bar, evenly, onto the edge of a leveled table or bench. Rotate the drop bar until the "plumb bob" you have created comes in contact with the center point of the stem clamp area of the handlebar. Mark with this location with a maker or pen in a location that you will be able to see near the opening of the stem clamp. 

I like my Spin Doctor Pro G3 due to the stable tripod base that works well inside and out on a variety of surfaces. Though it might not be necessary for some, I like that I can swivel the bike around the main vertical post to reposition my working angle on the bike (sometimes I'm on a stool). I don't think it's as easy or even possible to do that with some of the bipodal stands. Some people do not like the spinning knob used to operate the clamp. I find that it allows a nice sense of how tight I'm clamping various bike tubes as I close it. When I'm forced to clamp a thin tube on a road bike frame, I'm not quite as paranoid that I'm going to scratch or dent it. I'm also less likely to hold the frame tube at a bad angle and slam a clamp closed onto it because of the gradual but still quick and easy process. 

I have been looking around for information on this topic but can't find anything definitive. The tram routes through Manchester city centre are for trams (obviously), but it seems public transport can use the tramways as well. My understanding is that is legal for cyclists to use bus lanes, so does the same apply to the tram routes? I also seen people cycling on the tramways, but are they actually allowed to do so? Just because people are doing it doesn't make it legal after all, as plenty of people cycle on the pavements as well (which in Manchester is a special kind of stupidity given how busy the streets are!) Is there any official policy on the status of the tramways as cycle routes? I do know that Metrolink are rather hostile to cyclists, and I certainly wouldn't want to lose an argument to a tram whilst on a bike... 

I'm quite pleased with my 2012 Jamis Durango bike, I think it would fall into the $1000 range from the UK price I paid for it. It's a hardtail, if that puts you off, but I personally feel I prefer that to the full-suspension bikes I've tried (admittedly cheaper, made of steel, heavier and crappier). 

The Fuji VALite 1769 bicycle is a higher-end bike of its time and unless something really bad has happened to it, would definitely be worth getting parts repaired or replaced. 

You can practice making the bunny hop more of a fluid movement. Imagine a jump without a bike over something quite tall: 

Details... The primary and most notable difference between two identical tires (same tread, suppleness etc.) of different widths will be the amount of suspension they provide over bumps, cracks, rough surfaces and other irregular terrain. A lesser but notable difference will also be the size of the contact patch where they connect with the riding surface. A skinnier tire (with equivalent inflation) has less capacity to deform so can provide less suspension and insulation from irregular surfaces. It also provides a slightly reduced contact patch to grip the road, potentially diminishing the bike's 'sure-footedness' when cornering or braking. I think aerodynamic differences and weight are not notable concerns given your tire sizes and application. The only caveat is that any tire you choose should be properly inflated for the weight the bike is carrying. Too much pressure and there is no suspension from bumps. Too little pressure and bumps could cause flat tires, wheel damage or an accident. Knobs or varying tread patterns and various designs and types of tires change considerations somewhat but even a nice, wide, good quality tire is important for a high-end, fully-suspended downhill race mountain bike. A bike compatible with wider tires will usually have room for fenders and you can always put thinner tires on if you want to run your own experiments. 

No. It absolutely isn't. You know what happens when an umbrella catches the wind. Imagine that on an unstable device doing 30 mph. Even without wind the rain will be blowing in your face most of the time so you'd have to place the umbrella right in front of you for it to offer any kind of effective shielding from the rain. How are you supposed to see anything with an umbrella in front of you? Even a transparent one will be rain-soaked and impossible to see through. And that's not even considering the fact that you've got one hand off the handlebars all the time. How are you supposed to signal a turn if you only have one hand on the handlebars anyway? And God help you if a child runs into the road in front of you and you need both hands to apply sufficient braking. You shouldn't even consider it. Get a rain coat. 

Visijax make a high-visibility cycling jacket that also includes battery-powered indicators. It may be the way to go, at least in winter, if you don't mind looking like a bit of a prat. $URL$ 

Find the center of your stem and mark it near (or across) the clamp opening with the edge of a piece of masking tape. Find the easiest to measure location on your drop bar. 

Details: The front wheel repair (called "truing") should be around $20 plus another dollar or so to replace the broken spoke. While I haven't used hockey tape, others have had success with similar cloth tape as long as you're not buying extremely cheap stuff. You'll get more padding with standard synthetic handelbar tape (contains a bit of foam or synthetic cork) which starts around $8. By watching various youtube videos, you can wrap these yourself very easily. (Also, cheap cloth tape will be more messy and sticky and won't be as easy to unwrap and start over.) A reputable, friendly, quality bike shop will help you get your bike in safe, rideable shape for the least amount of money possible. Insist on the bare essentials for a safe ride, but listen to anything that they say is a true hazard. Technically, you can ride a bike frozen in a single usable gear, but a few affordable tweaks of the drivetrain and replaced cables can mean riding a bike that is much more enjoyable and capable of taking you anywhere you want to go. Given your bike and needs, a basic $50 tune up will get them to look at and repair the necessities which wouldn't include the wheel repair and handlebar tape mentioned above. Remind them you're on a budget and are going to try to do some improvements (handlebar tape) on your own. Showing this initiative sometimes helps. Be wary of anyone that steers you toward purchasing an entirely new bike. A good shop will have low-budget options and might even secretly do a few tweaks and fixes out of pride and a sense of responsibility to someone who is giving such a lovely old bike, new wings. 

Here's an experiment you can try that we used to do in high school Get an empty coke can with no dents or other disfigurements in it, place it upright on the ground, and stand on top of it. It should be able to bear the weight of most adults with normal body mass. Now put a small dent in the can and try it again. But be careful because the small dent will introduce a weakness into the can and it will almost certainly buckle under your weight this time. Obviously a bicycle frame is made from much thicker gauge aluminium than a coke can, but the same basic principles hold. A tube is an inherently strong structure, but only if it remains true. You put a dent into it, you put a region into the structure where stresses will concentrate and try to deform the tube further. In the short term, it should be fine, but I suspect the lifespan of the tube would now be measured in months rather than years, as aluminium is a softer metal than steel and is more prone to metal fatigue (alumimium always suffers from stresses that will begin fatigue damage no matter how small the load, according to wikipedia). You also have to consider that there may be other items of less obvious damage, such as small cracks opening up in welds that are small enough to remain hidden by the paint. Fatigue will set in at these points as well. If you do keep riding on this frame then I'd suggest monitoring the crash damage region very closely. Also, don't go mountain biking on a frame in that state! Stick to the roads. And stick to quiet roads where you're unlikely to hit anything else and ones with no potholes, because another big impact or bump could make the frame fold up like a book at the dent. As for repair, I suspect the only realistic option is to completely replace that tube. Given how difficult aluminium is to weld I expect the cost of doing that would approach the cost of an entire new frame anyway, and given the frame already has some miles on it and will have accumulated some wear and tear it will not have the life expectancy of a new frame. I think realistically, your only option is to put that frame out to pasture. 

Yes, I'd say there are structural reasons for those lines being roughly parallel and it is not arbitrary. (Though the usefulness of my answer depends a bit on my interpretation of your phrase "nearly so.") I think the similar angles of the tubes you mention has most to do with the strength of triangles and the design of the classic and ubiquitous "diamond" bike frame design which utilizes those triangles such that they accommodate the wheel size that is currently popular in a structurally sound configuration. The diamond frame also has some economy of materials - aiming to draw straight lines from point to point, creating those triangles efficiently. There is novelty and utility in other designs (step-through frames, folding bikes) but there are trade-offs and considerations that prevents the geometry choices from being arbitrary. 

Work a bit on smaller bunny hops - maybe up and down a curb - until you can start to feel yourself landing with a bit less force or until you get a sense that you are anticipating the landing. It was easier for me to yank and jump higher, but it took a while for me to learn how to jump in such a way that I was landing more gracefully and not thrashing my bike, body and wrists. The finesse and feel takes longer but is worth it! Everything happens in such a short period of time it's a little tough but you'll start to feel what works and what doesn't.
