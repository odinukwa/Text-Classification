Like Unsliced said, race the way you train. However, I was discussing a race with a friend who had a combo heart rate/GPS unit, and in Detroit, the marathon goes over the bridge to Canada then back to the US via a mile long tunnel, and the fact her GPS was off really unsettled her. She had become so dependent on the tools/toys that she got seriously rattled. Thus my advice would be use it, but be flexible enough to adjust to any issues. Besides you can identify at least two major zones with an HRM. 60% is the point at which you can start to hear yourself breathing. 85% is the point at which you can no longer hold a conversation. 

According to the NBA section of this Investopedia article, each season there is a "playoff kitty" which is divvied up amongst the various teams dependent on performance, from which the teams can choose how to distribute amongst players. Here's the exact quotes: 

No, the NBA team can not pay a player less than his contract due to injury. They can, however, get a salary cap extension under the Disabled Player Extension, as detailed: 

It would seem there are so many variables involved that are independent of the number of marathons you run to make any such conclusion meaningless. For example: 

I would suspect the primary benefit is time saved in transition. Usually shirts are required in races, so after the swim you have to do something to cover up. (I suppose you could wear stuff under a wetsuit, but I do not use wetsuits). If you do not have to change anything in transition it can help. Other than that, I suspect it is comfort. 

Additionally, playoff pool distribution amongst teams may not be even. As explained on wagesofwins.com, teams can distribute the money however they like - so I'd imagine that the "big name" star players will get a disproportionately large share of it. That said, If you look at the bottom of that article, if the pool was distributed fairly, making the playoffs only results in a $7,760 payout per player - so not a massive incentive. You have to make the NBA Finals to get a really large bonus. 

For short course triathlon as you suggest it is not worth worrying this much about shoes. Either use pedals with clips and straps (cages if you will) and ride in your running shoes, or else switch shoes in transition. For your runners, they sell stretchy laces so you can slip the shoes on, no need to retie the laces. This will minimize transition time. Running shoes that are properly fit to you are way more important than anything else. You can ride a bike in sneakers or in road shoes, but you cannot run in improper shoes for very long. 

It seems that the only downside to dropping your bat while running is that you simply have slightly less reach to ground yourself with. Beyond that, the bat is mostly not necessary for running. I was expecting to find a rule regarding equipment being left "in play" on the field, but it seems that these laws only refer to the fielding side's equipment, and not the batsmen. 

My experience with this has to do with getting the blood flowing, and my calve muscles hurt alot as I begin running, until I warm up. What I try is before I head out, not to sit, rather to move around, and bounce up on my toes as I move around (Activate calf muscles). Then I run for 6 minutes, and walk for 8 before continuing my run. This usually gets my calf muscles warmed up and blood flowing, so they do not go anaerobic and get lactic acid buildup. Sadly, this does not work every time, and I sometimes find I need a longer warm up. Your mileage may vary. 

Grades 1-5 are basically the same as the ATP/WTA GS/1000/500/250 system - a Grade 5 event is worth the least points, and a Grade 1 event is worth the most. Grade A events are always worth more than Grade 1 events, but Grade B events are generally denoted with something like "B2", which means that it's a regional championship worth slightly more than a Grade 2 event. Similarly, B1 events are worth slightly more than Grade 1s (but less than Grade As), and B3 events are worth more than Grade 3s, but less than Grade 2s. There are currently no Grade B events lower than B3. To be on the end-of-year rankings a junior player must have played in three Grade A events. 

The Olympic (or International) distance triathlon is 1500m swim, 40K bike, 10K run. Yet when run as the qualifier or at the Olympics, this is draft legal. Where as all tris of that distance I have ever raced (since I will never be fast enough to qualify) are not draft legal. Why the difference? 

Having ridden in traffic, on 6 lanes roads, even on highways (with shoulders) I can say the exhaust is a non-issue. Considering how few support cars there actually are, compared to a 6 lane road, I would say it is not even noticeable. 

I can't find any players who strictly meet this criteria, but Cristiano Ronaldo certainly has a case for it. He jointly holds the record for goals scored in a 38-game Premier League season (31 goals in 2007–08), as well as having held the record for the most goals scored in La Liga, with 40 in 2010–11 (albeit only for a solitary year, as Lionel Messi scored 50 the very next season). I specify a "38-game Premier League season" because in the early to mid 1990s, two players (Andy Cole and Alan Shearer) scored 34 goals in a single season, but they had 42 games to do this in. The Premier League officially acknowledges both of these totals as records, which means that if you found a stats book from 2011 listing the record number of goals scored in any individual season for every top-flight league, Cristiano Ronaldo's name will probably appear twice. 

When I was doing my distance training I found a litre of chocolate milk was a great cheap recovery drink. Lots of carbs, protein, tasty, and available everywhere. My friends find it amusing that every time an article is published suggesting this, they send me links, which I alas do not store. But soon (15-30 minutes) after your long run is finished, have some carbs and protein. Chocolate Milk is just an easy thing to handle at that point.
