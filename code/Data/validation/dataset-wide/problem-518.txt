Rotor diameter. You should probably get the same size as the old one; for a different size, you'll need an adapter to reposition the brake calipers. The way the rotor attaches to the hub. Most of them are held on with 6 bolts, but a few use the "Centerlock" attachement which looks like this: 

Most of it is just bolting stuff together; if you know what a bike is supposed to look like, it's pretty self-explanatory. Here are the areas that aren't self-explanatory, and require some specialized knowledge and/or tools. You'll get more useful information if you ask specific questions about these items. 

Park the bike inside, or at least under a roof. Even if you ride every day, your bike spends more time parked than it does riding. Clean and lube all the moving parts, especially the chain. Proper lubrication is a lengthy subject, and I won't attempt to cover it here, just keep in mind that the choice of lube depends on the application, and that WD-40 is never the right choice. If your bike is exposed to salt (from the sea, or from road de-icing) then you should wash it regularly. If there are scratches on the frame that penetrate all the way to bare steel, then cover them up. Any waterproof paint should work for touch-ups. Some people use nail polish. If the metal has already started to rust, remove all the rust before painting. Stickers or electric tape will also work for covering scrapes and preventing new ones. 

There should be a screw opposite the D-ring that you can tighten down to increase the friction on the shifter. On a shimano shifter a flat head driver should be used, but you can use something like a dime if you're in a pinch. 

The Cutter is a BMX style trick oriented fixed gear, not a track geometry bike. The specs here show that the fork you plan on using is going to be shorter than the standardbut and BMX geometry puts the front end up higher than track geometry so it may even out. The fork length difference could cause a problem with toe overlap, or even the wheel not fitting if the tire is too large. I'd recommend trying out the combo before buying, for sure. 

Those kits will definitely work. That skewer is a 9mm. The skewer is also 5mm because that's the measurement of a 9mm skewer in the center of the skewer. 

You can use disk brakes with road levers as long as you buy the ones specifically designed to work with road levers. The difference is the amount of cable pull (the distance that the cable moves when you squeeze the lever). This distance is lower for standard road levers than for MTB levers, so the design of the brake has to take this into account. I know that the Avid BB7 brakes are available in road and mountain versions, I'm not familiar with the Shimano line. 

The size of the tire. The way it's written here is kind of a mess, so no wonder you're confused. The rim size is 700c (this designation is a relic of a sizing system that's no longer used. See the link to Sheldon Brown in the other answer). On a 700c wheel, the diameter of the bead is 622 millimeters. This size is sometimes referred to as "29 inch" when it's on a mountain bike. It can also (very rarely) be called "28 inch". 25 is the width of the tire in millimeters (writing it as "25c" actually makes no sense). I assume that 1.0 is supposed to be the equivalent in inches. So what you have is a 700c 25 mm tire - pretty common size for road bikes. 

I would recommend using your power data to make sure you aren't going too hard out of the gate, like with any time trial. Try to keep your power in the Threshold-VO2 max range, with a high cadence, until you're within striking distance and then drop the hammer to the finish line. More on determining power levels here. This assumes you know how long you can hold a sustained AC level (aerobic capacity) effort. I would try to pace it so that you are ramping up your power into the finish, not a big burst at 200 meters out and then a gradual taper in. It really depends on the character of the climbs, I think some pre-riding of the course would be as, if not more, beneficial than power data for such short efforts. 

Try sitting on the bike while supporting yourself against a wall, then look down to see if anything is shifting under your weight. Or better yet, have someone else look. Check the axle nuts (or quick-release levers, depending on what you have) and make sure they're all tight. 

What kind of brakes are these? This doesn't sound "normal". If the pads are touching the rotor when you're not pulling the brake lever, then you have a problem that needs to be fixed. If they're not touching the rotor, then it's not quite as bad, but it's still not OK. 

There are ways to deal with this situation - none of them are very good. Which means that the best thing to do is to make sure you don't go there in the first place. If you maintain your brakes, and don't ride some horrible P.O.S. Walmart bike, then the chances of losing both brakes at the same time are very slim. 

An air horn is a great deterent if you don't think you can always out ride them. Yelling at them can be effective if you've got a loud voice. If you end up off your bike for any reason use it as a shield between you and the dogs. 

If your brakes are rubbing, or the wheel is rubbing on the frame then you probably need to adjust the wheel or the brakes. The quickest way to check is to use the brakes. 1) Pull the brake lever for the front wheel as far to the handlebar as it will go. It should be at least a finger width from the bar at full compression. 2) While watching the brake pads, the part of the brake touching the wheel, let up slowly on the lever until the pads are almost touching the wheel but not quite. 3) The pads should both be clear of the wheel. If one come clear first then either the brake needs adjusted or the wheel is not centered in the frame. 4) If both brakes clear the wheel at the same time then start turning the wheel slowly while continuing to hold the brake just clear of the wheel. If there's a problem with the wheel one side or the other will hit a brake pad. You can take it to a shop if the wheel needs to be trued. 

Well, there's not much else you can do, so yeah, I'd call it good enough. If there's any doubt, I'd just replace the axles. 

Yes, you can use a 1 1/8" fork with a 1 1/2" frame. I did it on one of my bikes. You just have to get a special "reducer" headset. It doesn't look goofy at all - you can't even tell unless you look closely. You'll have to get a threadless fork. Nobody makes reducer headsets for threaded forks. Most new forks come with an un-cut steering tube - that means it's a few inches longer than most people need, and you have to cut it to the right length. Make sure that the crown-to-axle distance is approximately the same as your old fork. If not, it'll change the bike's handling characteristics, maybe drastically. 

Just one thing I didn't see addressed in the other answers: Cycling shoes are very low-volume - which means they are supposed to fit very snugly and not have a lot of room for your foot to move around. This is why cycling specific socks are so thin - they are designed to maximize moisture transfer off of your foot (to keep your feet comfortable) while not creating extra pressure due to extra material and/or padding. Plus they're usually slathered with brand names and they match the rest of your kit. So, they're totally necessary if you're going to look pro. And as we all know, looking pro directly translates into going faster ;-). 

First off, you're best bet is to go to a bike shop and ask for some help. They'll be happy to help you out and teach you what you need to know. That being said, if you don't want to or can't make it to a shop, here's my two cents: Those don't look like cantilever brakes to me - they look like linear pull (or V-Brakes). mikes' answer is correct in pointing out that you need the ones without threads on the posts. Something like this will probably work: $URL$ 

What you have there is a replica of a WW2-era bike. That doesn't look like a traditional rod brake (see the Wikipedia link above). It's hard to tell what's going on, but I don't see any braking mechanism at the rim. So the brake must be in the hub (the oversized hub could be holding a generator - except there's already a generator on the other side of the fork). If the bike was made in the 1980s, they probably put in something that stops the bike effectively while still looking "vintage". This is pure speculation though. My advice is to buy the bike if you think it looks cool (which it does). If the brakes suck, you can always replace them with something else. 

Because road bikes are meant for going fast. And a 23 mm tire is faster than a 28. Sure, it's not enough to make a noticeable difference for 99% of all the people who buy those bikes... but those people all think they're in the 1%. 

As others have pointed out cycling is an inefficient way to exercise the muscles in your core. Cycling will utilize those muscles and your cycling performance will likely benefit from strengthening them - but cycling specifically won't really build strength in those muscles, you have to work them off the bike. This article from Bicycling covers the topic pretty nicely and has links to some great core workouts for cyclists. Personally, I've used the exercises described on here and they're pretty good. 

I'm considering buying a TT bike that has a full SRAM Red group. I'm wondering if it's possible to use my Shimano Ultegra 6700 left-side crank in place of the SRAM Red crank. Why? I've got a Stages power meter in the Shimano crank that I use on my regular road bike. One of the main reasons I went with the Stages meter was the flexibility of swapping the crank across multiple bikes. So, naturally I'd like to use my power meter on the TT bike by just swapping it. I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts on using the two systems together! EDIT/UPDATE: I ended up buying the TT bike. As the answer below says the SRAM crankset is not compatible with the Ultegra crank. So, I bought a used Ultegra crankset and put that on in place of the SRAM one. There was a spacer on the left side of the bottom bracket that had to be removed in order to get the Ultegra crankset to fit. I just tapped the bearing out, removed the little sleeve and tapped the bearing back in, took about 10 minutes total. The new hybrid SRAM-Shimano drivetrain functions perfectly, I even swapped out the big ring from the SRAM set for the Ultegra one (SRAM ring is a 55 which I like having on the TT bike). It looks a bit wonky with the mismatched crank/ring combo but everything works fine! 

You'll need to remove the old bottom bracket completely and replace it with a Shimano BB. The make and model of your bike and the model of the crank with some pics are necessary to say any more than that in terms of specifics. New Shimano cranks do require a new crank removal tool. 

If you've got nothing else vegetable oil will work in a pinch, as long as you give the chain a good cleaning before you put something else on there. I've done this a few times when I was broke and ran out of oil. It doesn't last as long but it got me through a week of commuting on several different occasions. 

Those are Motorcycle spoke nipples. Bicycles can have different spokes and nipples between the front and rear wheels but there is no standard.
