This is basically @agtoever comment, converted to an answer as a community wiki. There is an online service $URL$ which can identify star fields in photographs, and so convert from pixel position to ra/dec. It can export to FITS and generally seems to work well. Also, a bot on reddit.com/r/Astronomy can automatically annotate them images posted there, if you don't mind others seeing them. 

For the very simple reason that light travels very fast, but not infinitely fast. It takes light about 1 nanosecond to travel 30cm. That is so fast that you don't normally notice it. However it does take some time for light to reach your eyes, even from just across the room. Objects in space are a lot further away. It takes light about 1.2 seconds to reach the moon, and as you note it takes light 8 minutes to come from the Sun. The reason is that the sun is 150 million km away, and it takes about 8 minutes for light to go that far. If light did have infinite speed, it would be a weird universe. Effects would happen at the same time as causes, so the basic nature of cause preceding effect would be broken. The "speed=frequency*wavelength" formula for light would be broken. Refraction and diffraction wouldn't exist. A photon would be emitted and absorbed at the same time. Could something that is absorbed at the same time as it is emitted actually exist? 

You will need to find out what population II stars are. When you understand what a population II star is, ask yourself two questions about each statement: For example a) "Are population II stars out of the plane of the galaxy, and do they receive more cosmic rays", and "Would receiving more cosmic rays actually prevent life from forming". If you can answer yes to both questions, you have a potential answer. If you judge that several answers are possible, then re-read the definition of a population II star, and ask which statement is most pertinent to the definition of such a star. Good luck. 

"Perfectly" is a funny word. Perfect circles are a mathematical abstraction. Real objects are not "perfect". So supposing a "perfectly spherical planet" is to suppose something that does not and could not exist. All real planets are made of atoms and anything made of little clumps of matter cannot be perfectly spherical. Even if you built a planet that was as spherical as possible, it would be distorted by its rotation and the tides. So there are no perfectly spherical planets. Now you say "put in a perfectly circular orbit". This is like drawing a line that is exactly $\pi$cm long. Again you are supposing something that does not, and could not exist. What we can do is consider a mathematical model of gravity. If you model the sun and the planet as "particles" (ie point masses) and you model gravity with Newton's law of universal gravity, and if you give the model the system with the exact amount of energy to give a perfect circle, then the system will remain in a perfect circle, it will never become elliptical. If you use general relativity to model gravity, then the release of gravitational radiation will mean that no circular orbits are possible, all orbits will spiral inwards, however it would not become elliptical. Something similar will happen with quantum models of gravity. So your question can only be answered in the context of a mathematical model of gravity. 

When light is emmitted by an object that is moving away from us, the light is shifted to the red. This is an example of the doppler effect. So the red shift measures radial velocity, not distance. By estimating the distance to galaxies, Edwin Hubble found that the velocity of galaxies correlates with their distance. So by measuring red shift you can estimate the distance of a galaxy. The distance is only an estimate, and there is cosiderable uncertainty in our knowledge of the distance of galaxies. Hundreds of millions of light years of uncertainty. The distance to even the fastest moving galaxies doesn't change fast enough to be measured. Even if a galaxy is moving close to the speed of light, in one year it would only have travelled 1 light year, much less than the uncertainty in the estimate of the distance. 

It varies throughout the year. A book or a website with maps will help. In Spring, Leo and Bo√∂tes dominate the southern skies, with Coma Berencies between them In Summer, the summer triangle of Deneb, Altair and Vega is seen, with Cygnus flying along the Milky Way, and the rich star fields of Saggitarius closer to the horizon. In Autumn there is the square of Pegasus, with Andomeda riding, past Perseus And in Winter, Orion dominates the southern skies, with his dogs following. In the North, Cassiopea and the Ursa Major, are on opposite sides of the Pole star. 

As relativistic effects will cause clocks to run slower, a frame of reference must be chosen when considering the time of the "big bang". There is a natural and convenient choice of reference frame, based on the cosmic microwave background. The cosmic background appears to be extremely red-shifted light, indicating it is receding from us very fast, due to the expansion of the universe. If we choose a frame in which the CMB is receding equally fast in all directions, we have a convenient frame of reference. It is called the Comoving frame. Now that we have a frame of reference, we can talk about time and distance in a way that all observers that share this frame can agree. In the comoving frame, the "big bang" occurred about 13.8 billion years ago. To directly answer the question: The time measured is the time in the comoving frame and relativistic time dialations (time-lapse) are considered. 

The mass of Vesta was determined by observing its effect on 197 Arete. The model used is that Vesta will cause the eccentricity and semi-major axis to change. By observing the asteroid before and after their encounter, and determining the asteroid's orbital elements before and after, one can find the angle of deflection. Model the motion as a hyperbolic encounter and one can find the combined mass. Since 197 Arete is much smaller than Vesta, this gives a good estimate of the mass of Vesta. The mass of asteroids can also be found by their perturbations of Mars, providing there are sufficiently accurate observations. Viking radar data (with an accuracy of 7m) allowed for good estimates of the mass of the major asteroids. The Dawn mission to Vesta and Ceres made very high accuracy measurements of the gravity field around them and so their mass. The math involved is essentially just Newtonian mechanics. You know the positions and velocities before the encounter. There is an energy conserving encounter with a force of $$F = \frac{m_1 m_2 G}{r^2}$$ Finding the angle of perturbation allows you to find the reduced mass $$\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}$$
