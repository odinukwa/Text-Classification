One approach is to direct the conversation back to an investigation of the problem. Firstly, you should acknowledge that there's a disagreement, and propose to change gears to break the stalemate. You've both made your cases and you still don't agree on what should be done. Defuse the situation by saying something like: You're the boss. Ultimately, what you say goes. But I don't think you want to force every decision we make. Let's see if we can get somewhere by changing perspectives. (Ideally, he should be the one to lead the discussion this we, but we don't always get the boss we deserve). The trick is to get away from solutions. When you talk about which solution to choose, you end up arguing, because solutions are mutually exclusive. When you talk about aspects of the problem, you can both be looking out for different aspects of the problems and still have a productive discussion. For instance, your boss will likely want a cheap and fast solution, whereas you may want one that is maintainable, and works well for the customer. The solution is to map out what these requirements mean in detail and to find a smart way of satisfying all of them. You might, for instance, design an ideal solution, but then add a plan of implementation that allows for the first implementation to be delivered quickly and cheaply, but with a continued development towards a more sustainable solution. A second point to bear in mind is that once people are convinced of something, reason and logic work against you. The more arguments you throw at them, the more they dig their heels in. The trick is togive up on convincing them of the whole big truth at once, and to find somesmall commitment they can make. Ie. don't try to convince someone that Apple is better than Microsoft, buy them an ipod nano. Break the absolutes. Don't try to turn a staunch Republican into a Democrat, just ask him which Democrat he'd support if he had to. Find one small commitment towards your point of view and ask them to make it (and be prepared to do the same). 

I think you are correct - this is none of their business. The "planned or not" question was entirely inappropriate as well. I believe your best move now would be to ride out the tensions, but starting now, every time it comes up, make it known that you don't appreciate the comments that are directed at you. Simply say, "I decided to keep it to myself for personal reasons, and I would prefer not to discuss it further." This may seem a bit cold, but it doesn't sound like your workplace has many friendly bonds anyway - I don't think it would put you in a worse position than you already are. Regarding your boss, if he complains about you not telling him in person, it may be sufficient to point out that he's not often in the office. It sounds like you would have been fine with telling him in person, but he wasn't around to do so. Tell him this if he continues to bring it up. Overall, it sounds like this might be a good time to look for new work. You mentioned that you've considering looking for a new job, but that life plans seemed to get in the way. Consider starting the job search anyway - if you don't share your intent to leave until you have a start date at a new company, you could make the transition without it having to interfere with your home life. 

I have been in my current role for 4 months, and I want to move to a different team because the career track my manager has laid out and discussed with me does not work with my career goals and aspirations. There was some confusion before I joined my team, and I was told that I would be in a different position/track than the one I ended up being in (my manager agrees that there was confusion around the position I was coming in to). What can I do if I don't want to waste a year of my life in this position, but also don't want to lose relationships (I don't hate my work or my coworkers, and my manager has been great about listening to and implementing my suggestions, however the work I am doing is only half of what I thought I would be doing when I joined). 

How can I craft a response to these students that says "we have no openings and please don't contact me again", in a way that is professional but firm? 

Conclusion Without knowing the terms of the contract, it's hard to say if you should or not. I tend to take a conservative approach to these kinds of things, so I would say breaking the contract is not worth it, but a reasonable person may come to the opposite conclusion. You'll have to balance the potential negative consequences with the possible upsides of research and publication opportunities and decide for yourself. 

I currently have the company name, employment dates, location, title, and project/responsibility descriptions for every position, so this layout would save me a lot of whitespace between the entries. Additionally, the earlier internships currently contain somewhat extraneous bullet points just because I don't like having a job entry with only one bullet point. This new layout would help me focus my descriptions on only the most important details without leaving awkward-looking job entries. 

Recently (2 mos. ago) joined a data analysis team at a large U.S. corp. This team is an interesting mix of technical and not very technical people. My boss and I are more on the technical side- can code in various languages, can employ different tools etc. Co-worker A and B are responsible for analysis of specific data and products- while they cannot code, they have knowledge about their subject matter and can utilize a data visualization tool effectively. I respect that we all know different things and are experts in different ways. I always try to get my co-workers' opinions on things they know more than me, like their data sets, their products or the company. The problem is this: I feel like I rub my co-workers the wrong way when I want to be more technical in the way I do things. I get this impression because Co-worker A has told me on more than one occasion that "this team is about X" and "we do things like X". Here's my issue with that- my hiring manager is happy to have me utilize whatever skills I have to my disposal, and this team knew what I was about when it was hiring me. In fact, we talked about how I like to supplement my work with code or want to do "Y" type of analysis to our data during my interviews. Maybe this wasn't conveyed properly. My boss's boss is also happy with the direction I take with tasks- he is excited to see me do things that are new for this team. Because of this he invites me to meetings that either co-worker A or B, or both, may not be invited to. This I think is another sore point for both of them, me being new and all- evident by not responding to my friendly IMs, like hey how are you. I would like to have a good working relationship with both coworkers, but I am unsure how to overcome the "resentment" that may arise because of these issues. I call it resentment for lack of a better word. More context: co-worker A has been at the company for 3 years, has a ton of friends here, and I think doesn't like that I am not truly a subordinate to him (I think I am, I have told him on more than one occasion he's the expert on X and I trust his on judgement on X etc.) He doesn't want to teach or mentor me, but I think is more interested in maintaining his power and status; this is evident by him complaining about me asking too many questions to someone from another team. This co-worker is also quite gossipy and may even tell tall, negative tales (though not sure about this). Problem to solve: how do I survive in this kind of team dynamic? 

This would be an excellent topic for you to discuss with your manager. He/she should be able to give you advice about achieving a good work/life balance to manage your stress. He or she should also be able to help you prioritize your responsibilities to make them more manageable, or even move some of them to someone else. If you're overloaded, your manager needs to know that, and don't be afraid to say, "I can take on this other project, but I need deadlines extended on other projects accordingly." He or she may not realize how loaded down you are, so you have be honest and upfront about how much work you can handle. You mentioned your company is small, so you may not have a dedicated HR team, but you can talk to them as well if you do. It's normal to feel stressed early on in your career. You're still learning how to be an efficient worker and managing adult responsibilities outside of work, in addition to your job duties. It's important to recognize this, and take advantage of resources at your disposal to help manage it. In addition to your manager, you can also seek out other, more experienced people in your industry to get advice, such as your old professors that you had a good relationship with. Many of them probably worked in the industry before moving into the academic world. Since you mentioned working long hours and holidays, I would like to add extra emphasis to the work/life balance. Completing your projects at work is certainly important, but it doesn't do you much good to burn yourself out by not allowing yourself to have a life outside of work. You're obviously already feeling the effects of burn-out. Don't let a single-minded focus on work sour your career and other aspects of your life.
