Stop covering the sh*t he makes. Let managers step on it and let him bear the consequences of his work. If you remove his accountability by filling the (alleged) gaps he creates, there is no way that the organization will feel the need to fix the issue. 

you don't really have to fill in the time with "inane" topics just for the sake of using the entire hour. As additional benefit, you won't risk being perceived as a person who needs to be micromanaged. Based on my experience in most of the cases half an hour is more than enough for a weekly face to face. 

Based on my experience one will always struggle with HR being non-technical: on one side they can be "too loose", like you experienced, or on the other side they can be "too strict" on certain keywords, neglecting synonyms. Just sit down with HR and give a factual feedback on the screening, mentioning the issues you have experienced: address the issues, don't blame the screener. Ask how can the position description can be improved to make them easier to filter the candidates, and use your examples as test cases. 

One of my former employer (and owner of the small company where I was working) drove to work 2 days after getting hemorrhoids surgery, when he was supposed to lay flat in bed and rest. Reason? He thought that without him watching on us we would slack the entire day and steal time from the company. As an underling you can do pretty much nothing about this: anything you may say can trigger her paranoia into thinking you are plotting something against her, ending up in making your work life miserable. If the paranoid behavior is annoying you and affects your working, I suggest: Short term: try to make visible what and why you are doing things to deflect her paranoia from you. Long term: search for a more healthy employment. 

One of the primary responsibilities of a project manager is to help clear roadblocks and facilitate communications between stakeholders. The last thing a project manager would want would be to not hear about a problem that needs attention until the weekly status meeting, for example. 

Will you modify my resume without my approval? Do I get final say on which opportunities I'm presented as a candidate for? How does your firm source new candidates and new opportunities? Do you present multiple candidates simultaneously for a position, or one at a time? Can I speak with the account manager for each opportunity that you may present me for? etc 

I think that, in addition to Greg's answer, it is also fair to end the interview when you know that you're not going to hire the person for whatever reason. There's no sense in wasting either participant's time going through a charade of an interview until you hit some magic time threshold. It's definitely a little harsh and, as an interviewer, I hate to do it. But I make sure the recruiters I work with convey to the candidates that there is a possibility of the interview lasting as little as 10 minutes. And yes, I have interviewed candidates that lasted as little as 10 minutes. At which point I say "Look, I'm sorry, this just isn't going to happen. Best of luck." 

It simply says that you check your mailbox on Sunday. Executives in most of the companies are not bound to Monday-Friday 9-17 work schedule, so I think it is normal for them to send mail whenever they feel like doing it. It's up to you to set the boundaries on how you deal with those mails. You don't mention the executive ever pointed out a delayed answer to weekend mail, so it's not a big deal. 

Normally not. Whenever I have searched for a high-tech job in the Netherlands I was almost never asked for reference letters. Normally you are required a CV/resume and a cover letter, sometimes a list of exam with grades, but reference letters is not really requested as common practice. 

I have had colleagues in the Netherlands who changed job while being in therapy for burn out or other serious health conditions. As far as I know, it's not something that will prevent you from getting a job, as long as you are open about it with your employer. You may ask your doctor advices on how to handle it with your employer (he/she will surely have other patients in the same condition). Maybe you can settle to start working part time (0.6 or 0.8 FTE) and then gradually increasing your work load as your health situation improves. 

Well, if they keep asking and they keep getting the info they want (with the added value of not having to pay a dime), why should they stop bothering you? Politely answer that 

The chairs that you should be looking at have a crazy amount of options when it comes to adjustment. I have personal experience with Aerons and Steelcase chairs, generally considered the cream of the crop for office chairs, and both of them are outrageously adjustable and configurable. If you're looking at chairs in this price range, the personal preference for employees will probably just come down to the mesh vs non-mesh as everything else can likely be moved into appropriate positions. However, recognize that many people won't familiarize themselves with the chair that they're using and it may be beneficial to bring in an ergonomic expert to help educate people on how to appropriately adjust their chairs for long term comfort. 

There's a difference between 'taking credit' and 'getting credit.' The way to combat those that Take it is to Get it. You get credit by continuing to do good work, documenting your contributions, communicating effectively and gradually increasing the scope of your influence and responsibilities. People who are in a position to Give credit should eventually see your contributions and provide the feedback you're looking for. For example, if you're working on Project X and a notorious credit stealer is responsible for attending a status meeting on behalf of the team, see if you can volunteer to also attend the meeting and provide your own status. Or further, you can volunteer to take over the responsibilities of attending the meeting under the guise of 'professional advancement.' The last thing you want to do is try and make a public spectacle of the situation as it makes you look petty and has the exact opposite impact you're hoping for. 

I don't think you have to fill the entire hour. Managers are normally very busy, and usually glad to cut some meeting short if possible. Therefore, once you have 

Goes along well with stating you agree with him. Stating that you are not contradicting him is a rather convolute way to express "I agree with you" and can surely take longer to be understood. 

I have been in your same situation. While working in a small start up as tester, I have found a major bug in their code just one month before a fair where they wanted to present it. The bug was so severe that all the work done in the 4 months before to validate the software was just garbage. The CEO/manager blamed me in front of all the colleagues for the thing, and claimed I was being too slow in reprocessing the data (even though he said I was 25% faster than the previous tester), and pushed me to come earlier, leave later and even skip lunch breaks (at least 10 hours/day). Long story short, after few months I took the decision to quit that job and with no regrets started looking for a better position. But what helped while I was still engaged in the job and had to get through every single day was seeking (and finding) support from my colleagues. During our lunch breaks we usually had a fair share of "discussion" on the actions of the "pointy haired boss", which basically became the subject of our jokes. After building up this solidarity among us, we managed to stitch to the 8 hours/day, by leaving all when the 8 hours were due. To answer your question: try to build a safety net with your colleagues, share the burden and let out some of the stress. Meanwhile keep searching and be confident in your skills. 

Just like any interview, you need to focus on you and the value you can bring to the company. Be yourself, don't lie, relax, don't ramble, relax and end every answer to every question on a positive note...and make sure to relax. For example, Them - "Tell me about your Ruby experience." You - "While I have not developed anything in Ruby, I do have a passing familiarity with it. I am, however, absolutely confident in my ability to pick up and adapt to new technologies." If they follow-up with questions about situations where you picked up new technologies quickly, you can talk about developing on Android, your knack for troubleshooting hardware problems and how that translates to writing software. If they ask about your degree, talk about how your experiences in Poli-Sci translate to software development, for example: Them - "You have a degree in Political Science, how does that make you qualified for a dev position?" You - "A lot of the political science I studied involved the analysis of complex social systems and the solving of complicated people problems. I believe that the non-methodical techniques of problem-solving coupled with the social analysis make me uniquely qualified for a position at this Social Media company. I also have a fair amount of coursework in Math/CompSci/Physics/What-ev, and I pride myself on being able to approach problems from many different angles to find the most appropriate solution." Don't sling BS, demonstrate passion and a willingness to learn and you might just get there. 

To optimize your effort, I suggest you take the no response as a lack of interest on your profile and move on. If you really want to show interest in the company/position, give a call before applying and ask some questions about the role. In this way when they see your CV they will already have you in their mind, and you will be "oh, this is that candidate who called me...". 

I am based in Europe, but my experience is similar to your: most of the recruiters have the attention span of a 3 years old, and appear to be constantly chasing new CV. Once they got one, they look for another one. In some cases I even had to contact them to propose positions for which I felt fitting. The pattern I have experienced here is: 

It sounds at best a borderline comment, as it implies that as a woman you should be more "decorative", which per se is not appropriate, as I assume the job you are hired for is not purely based on appearance. You should probably check what is the company policy on sexual harassment, gender equality and if there is any speak up policy about such episodes. Then, if you feel molested by such comments, take action. I would suggest such order of escalation (but this is based on the policy and culture of the company where I work): 

If you're establishing a relationship with a recruiter, then the questions you want to ask should initially cover their representation of you: 

Basically, what it comes down to is to be a little 'sales-y' by not saying no, never lie and defer to your boss as quickly as possible. 

The communities in which we work throughout our lives are generally pretty small. You never know when you might come across some of the same folks you're working with now. And you can't predict if they'll be in a position to decide whether or not you get some job or some promotion. You don't say how much time you have left on your notice period, but if it's just a couple of weeks, I'd suck it up and power through. Make sure all of your work is done, any transition stuff is prepared, etc... Your manager is treating you differently because they're likely taking your departure personally. This happens all the time and I'd just ignore it, do your job and thinking about how great things are going to be in your new gig in a couple of weeks. 

I feel like these questions help me get a feel for the people I will be working with and I can decide if they do business in a way that works for me. 

I think that half of your problem may just be culture shock. The disparity between a 2500+ company and a small development team at a startup is pretty significant. I think that you may have been a little optimistic with your expectations of dedicated mentoring. What you're experiencing now is not altogether uncommon in that environment and there are a few things that you can do to help make things a little smoother for you. Domain knowledge is really important, but some of your questions may require a lot more explanation than you initially expect. For example, in finance, you may encounter the word 'option.' Options are pretty complicated to fully understand and a passing question to a developer working on something else might not be the best way to cover that. You can potentially counteract this issue in the following ways: 1- Ask others for resources rather than answers. Sites like Investopedia can be a good starting point for concepts. Find out resources that other developers may use to help them understand the domain. Start compiling these resources in a company or departmental wiki to help future new hires. 2- Form good relationships with non-developers that are domain experts and ask them for resources too. This may evolve into someone 'taking you under their wing' to grasp the domain. At the very least, it will let you 'spread out' your questions 3- Ask your peers the best way to ask them questions. Some people prefer email, some would prefer a meeting while others can handle the interruptions from an IM or a question over the cubicle wall. 4- Find a pain point and own it. The culture shock you're experiencing can be incredibly overwhelming. Adding in the difficulty of learning a new domain and you, obviously, find yourself second guessing every decision you've ever made. You need to be able to focus on something specific and actionable and get yourself a 'win.' Listen carefully to the things that people are complaining about. Grab one that sounds solvable and take responsibility for it. This should help your confidence, your relationship with your peers and the efficiency of their work. 

A company usually thinks of its employees like "progressing". Therefore wanting to stay in the same position is already kind of strange and sometimes not well perceived. Even more weird can be the will to step down, so the crucial point here is how you motivate the question which you will get: with your experience, why are you applying for a junior position? If you are able to tell a convincing story there would be no big issues. 

If your mind is really made up for leaving, there is no reason in playing with the fire and risking your perspective employer to doubt your commitment. If, as you say, it's the company tune that motivates you to leave, it is not an higher salary that will accommodate that. You are wasting time (yours, your current manager's, your future manager's) just to fiddle. If this comes to surface it won't praise your attitude. 

hinting this to most of the prospective employer sounds to them like a "hey, change your entire Excel based workflow just to accommodate for my brilliant capacity with MatLab!". Together with soft skills you may lack or need to develop (as suggested in other answers), they need to be convinced that you fit in their organization, not that their organization can easily adapt to your way of working. And don't forget, of course, that there can be other candidates more qualified than you.
