Morality is one of those lovely minefields of thought where cultural upbringing and history are perhaps the more relevant factors to consider. Case in point is that in certain cultures in times past (Mongolian comes to mind), if you could get away with stealing from your enemies (or even your friends). It did not matter the harm you might have done by depriving a village of its food, or a child its mother. So long as your own and your villages needs were met, you were considered brave, strong, and with qualities to aspire to. If on the other hand you tried to get away with that kind of behavior in Western culture today, you'd be granted 2 to 15 in a less than hospitable lock-up. Cultures change over time. The fiercely defended ideals that we cling to today might be considered quaint and rustic tomorrow, or may become even more fiercely defended and held up as moral example by some depending on how successfully defended they might be. Intellectual property issues in particular are at a very interesting point. On the one hand there are those who would claim that something like an idea, or a sound, or a style is something of value and should be guarded jealously and paid for dearly, while others argue that such ephemeral things such as ideas and thoughts, art, and suchlike should be shared freely as something that should benefit all equally. To muddy the waters, we have others still who wish to own everything and share nothing unless it benefits themselves personally, and yet another corner where there are those who wish to take what they will and see it as a form of personal entitlement regardless of whether they should or not be allowed to do so. Each has a case or a point they might make, and which they feel comfortable with from their own moral point of view. Each sees the other's view as wrong, and their own as justifiable. But immoral? Perhaps it comes down to a question of intent. If by taking an action to obtain something illegally the intent was to profit personally, or to harm the property owner in some way, then that could be considered a theft which would be considered wrong, but not necessarily immoral. If the intention was otherwise innocent of intent to cause harm or to profit from the action, then it would not necessarily be right, and certainly not immoral. But that's almost entirely my own view, and certainly not an absolute. As to whether the item in question is tangible in any physical sense, it shouldn't really make a difference if the theft in question causes harm to someone else. If it comes down purely to a question of morality, then intention to harm others in some manner could be considered immoral, while a lack of intent could not. A younger child stealing money from your wallet to buy sweets might not be considered to have behaved immorally, yet that same child as an older teenager stealing money to purchase drugs or sex might be seen in a entirely different way - except perhaps to our earlier ancient Mongolian who'd probably laugh it off and ask what all of the fuss is about. Perhaps we shouldn't be asking if it is immoral to behave in the manner stated in the OP's question, but instead whether it is unethical? 

Wow - timely. This topic is really trending lately. Ok, so rather than write an equation to prove black equals white and endanger myself at the next zebra crossing, I'd like to put forward a couple of logical arguments to highlight some gaps. 1. Where Infinite Regression is impossible In the research you mentioned above (ie. Aristotle) that the impossibility of infinite regression means that everything must have a beginning, and a prime mover must have been there to create that beginning. Yay prime mover. 2. Where Infinite Regression is possible However, there an equally logical argument that the possibility of an infinite regression is also the cause of a prime mover. What you can say is that the infinite regression sits in a bubble of time, and outside of this bubble of time sits a prime mover who is without time. Because the universe is subject to time, but there is a hypothetical non-time environment, you can simply have the two sit side by side. The prime mover who is without time doesn't need to have gone back to the infinitely old universe to kick thing off, but was just always there. Yay prime mover. Back to reality The human mind is so creative and flexible it can always find a way to justify or explain a prime mover. When arguing against a true believer, it's impossible to win because they will always fall back on 'but god must have created the big bang' type of argument. God as an explanation is like the ultimate set of wildcards - that's why you can't use facts to debunk it. However, a truly logical mind knows there is no such thing as a prime mover because ultimately the argument isn't about infinite regression, big bangs, physics, or maths.. but comes down to the most beautiful logical statement of all time.. Ockham's razor: If given the choice between: 

I feel compelled to ask, what has credibility got to do with atheism or faith? Why should an atheist be considered more or less credible than someone who believes in a deity? If someone is a priest, yet philosophized the non-existence of God, would it hold that he were necessarily a hypocrite, or merely exploring another point of view and questioning his faith? If someone is a self-proclaimed atheist in public, but secretly prays to God, is he necessarily a hypocrite, or is he someone who is questioning his atheism - in some ways his faith? In both cases, you could say that neither is strictly practicing what they preach, and yet it doesn't necessarily follow that they lack credibility if your own beliefs align with theirs. The Christian may say that the Atheist lacks credibility because history documents through scripture that God exists, and the evidence is irrefutable to those willing to see it. The Atheist likewise says that there is no fundamental basis for the existence of a supreme being and the evidence is irrefutable because there is no directly observable proof. As to whether anything has changed, do we have any knowledge that confirms that ancient philosophers weren't vilified for an apparent hypocrisy? We do know that many were persecuted in their day for teaching heresies, so outwardly practicing hypocrisy would have been a means of survival, but not necessarily an indication that the philosophers themselves were actually hypocritical. Is it any more necessary today to practice what you preach? Today we have technologies undreamed of in ancient times. I think that makes it so much harder for anyone today to preach one way, yet live another. In ancient times, your reputation could not be disproved merely on hearsay unless you had a particularly vocal and powerful opponent. These days, any kid with a smartphone can be your undoing. In some ways, it is therefore more important to practice what you preach. However, the general public can be quite forgiving. Give it a few years, and people will forget an indiscretion or two. Do some amazing good in the mean time, and they'll forgive you as well. The cynic within me also feels compelled to point out that with good PR, even the most vilified individuals are likely to be portrayed positively enough that the odd hypocritical moment will be overlooked. Those who live a hypocritical daily existence however, are likely to be treated rather harshly, yet like those philosophers of old, each will have a loyal core following who will see past the practice in order to accept the preach. In that sense, perhaps things haven't really changed at all. 

Relative to sciences, measuring (or defining) progress in philosophy seems more complilcated. I also presume that more so than in sciences, what pushes a particular philosophical view/approach out of the mainstream may not be directly related to its merits as a theory but be due to other factors like sociopolitical ones (e.g. philosophy of religion). But of course, it could be that the nature of the problem is such that no meaningful progress can be made at this point in time (consciousness?) And so here my question is whether progress in ethics has been made. Myself I imagine there has been some, because even if there are (and will always be) disagreements about values, we can still make progress by logically working out the consequences of adopting some, check how coherent the particular ethical stance is, etc. And what about all the recent work on animal ethics, is that not progress forward from the philosophy of human rights and that too being progress itself? At the same time, I am aware that many religions and older philosophical systems hundreds of years ago too had their views about proper treatment of animals and people too and that it may be merely a reflection of our time and place (me in US in 2000s, for example) and not sign of philosophy's progress that this kind of work is being done now. In other words, progress in applied ethics and not other areas. Anyhow, appreciate your views. 

My 'simple' answer coming now.. Dictatorship: Control of government is concentrated in a single person. This is mostly bad. Some people have argued that Singapore is benefiting from a 'benevolent dictatorship' in Mr Lee. But by and large, dictatorships are corrupt, criminal, and in every case - repressive. Maybe it only works for very small populations who willingly accept a single-person ruler, but if that type of ruler has the genuine support of their people, then they are almost a type of perpetually elected president. The reality is that a dictator is not voted in or out, and only survives by force. Communism: Control of government by committee - peers who nominate and support each other. Just like Dictatorship, there is no opportunity for the population to have any say, and the views of the committee are inflexibly applied to all. It's similar to a dictatorship in many ways. However, I'm sure there are many people who will want me to include the economic and ideological aspects of Communism, as these elements are intrinsically linked. Communism also differs from Dictatorships and Democracies in that it includes rules on how resources are allocated amongst its citizens. However, Communism is NOT intrinsically linked to religion or personal ideologies as some people state. That is Leninism, Stalinism, or Maoism. These leaders created additional layers to their version of Communism. There are many religious Kibbutz in Israel that practice Communism - so religion is not strictly an issue. Hippies also set up their own communes. Democracy: Control by people who are only temporarily allowed to sit in a position, based on whether they can remain elected to those positions. The structure of these positions can vary, with concentration of power in a single person (president, but balanced by congress) or in a party (parliament, but balanced by the houses of parliament). Electoral power is held by voters, and over time this has included only the elites and educated, or the general population. Even until the recently, blacks and women were barred from voting in most democracies. The general concept is that one person carries one vote, but with the electoral college in the US, and the practice of gerrymandering, it's possible to give some votes more value than others. While still imperfect, the the advantage of this governing structure is that it provides far more incentive to remove corruption and govern for the good of the people. Hope this is what you're after Cheers 

A true act of altruism is a choice made by an individual to serve the needs of others without thought of gain for one's self. Thus, if you are forced or coerced to commit an act for the greater good, then you are not yourself acting altruistically, but instead acting out of either duty or of a fear of reprisal. Regardless of the apparent benefit to one's self, it is more likely to be in the better interests of the coercer to push someone to an act of apparent altruism. As for right or wrong, you might personally feel it is wrong for someone to force another person to behave in a particular manner, yet another person may feel it satisfies their own morality if they can provide a suitable justification for their act of coercion, or perhaps justification isn't required. Perhaps it is suits the coercer's morality to force an act of apparent altruism, simply because it can be done. In the case however of the media publishing stories about the billionaires who are all standing together to persuade other billionaires to do some apparent good in the world, I suspect it may in part be that there are feelings involved of accomplishment, pride, and a need for a measure of validation for individual acts through the subsequent similar actions of peers. But in this case, we are perhaps starting to blur the lines between philosophy and psychology, and therefore the issue of morality may be irrelevant. 

Most of the upvoted comments are quite good, so I'll just add my ten cents that hasn't already been covered. Assumption underlying your query - maybe you're not an atheist To have originally come to your query, you must have made some assumptions that your dualistic experience, being a consciousness beyond the material body, is supernatural. More than that, supernatural in the sense of a traditionally understood immortal soul. If what you are suggesting is that your consciousness resides in a traditional soul, then I would argue your atheistic leanings are contradictory to your dualistism. Alternate assumption - maybe you can still be an atheist However, if what you're eluding to is that your consciousness resides in a non-material component of your being, which you are not defining, then this does not contradict atheism. For example, consciousness is believed to be an emergent property of the brain. It's not material but is an effect of all the activity and cannot be pinpointed to any specific parts of the brain. However, you are probably no longer an atheist if.. I would personally argue that there are some limits to how far you can argue this duality and still remain an atheist. The purpose of atheism isn't just to deny god, but gods, spirits, and the supernatural. It's to say, there are natural explanations for the human experience and our natural world. Some of these natural explanations might end up being bizarrely magical in appearance, maybe our consciousness resonates on some quantum level and exists in multiple dimensions, maybe there's an untapped sensitivity in our brains that reacts to the universe. Who knows. But as wild as these possibilities get, it's important that we don't simply replace one type of superstitious gobbledeegook, with another set of gobbledeegook. If you are starting to believe in a model that your actual consciousness does not reside in your brain but resides in a spiritual realm, then your beliefs are moving away from atheism and towards ietsism. Maybe you are an Ietsist ($URL$ ;) 

I was searching for an article on fairness in a couple of online encyclopedias but had no success. There seem to be entries for various sorts of justice though, like the two I came across: distributive justice and procedural justice. I'm assuming there are other ones as well? Anyhow, as I understand it, fairness and justice are not exactly the same, the former being more subjective and depending more on gaining the satisfaction of the parties involved and the latter being more about decision being made according to certain ethical/moral/legal principles. This is of course my limited understanding of it, and I'm aware also of a lot of overlap between the two, as those ethical or legal principles can be created with concern for what people consider what is fair, and vice versa, people might accept something as being fair partly because certain decision was reached by impartial people who were guided by these ethically guided principles. But where does this leave me with philosophy of fairness? Does it become a psychological question, something purely subjective, like an empirical question about what different people consider fair? Is it a question of deserving, with its potential humanistic or religious dimension of human worth and value? Does the answer depend on culture and society, on politics, on economy? And on and on and on.... I appreciate any suggestions or references to help me 

I've read a few of the answers and have to agree that it can be a complex issue. But, I take note of your question. You've asked someone to highlight the main differences between the three. That means avoiding all the various in-depth explanations that cut across political science, sociology, and economics. Disclaimers :P However, before I give you my simple solution I'd like to provide some caveats and assumptions: 

Which is the most likely given Ockhams? It's option 1 of course. The more assumptions you place in your statement, the more unlikely it becomes. The second statement has twice the number of assumptions! It's not about having a definitive answer, it's not about proof, and it's not about belief. It's about common sense to recognise what's the most probable answer. No-one will ever know for certain because science will always discover more unknowns, and religion will always hijack those unknowns to argue a prime mover. Footnote: The infinite regression isn't just about stepping back in time to understand the sequence of events for creation and evolved of the universe.. it's also applicable to the logical argument of who created the prime mover, and who created the creator of the primer mover, and who created the creator of the creator .. etc. This is where the requirement for a prime move is equally illogical, irrespective of whether infinite regression is possible or not. 

It's a fallacy. I don't understand the user who says it's not. Although I'm not sure what it's labeled. It might be the genetic fallacy or perhaps a kind of false appeal to authority. This person is basically making questionable assumptions and implying they're factual: That if you are a girl, then you would understand "girls problems". Not that you would have these problems, or experience them, and not that you would understand your own specific problems as a girl, but that you would understand "girls problems." Nor is this given as a kind of probability (based on, say, the idea of familiarity with problem is more likely to give you understanding of it). No, you're not told that you may not but that you simply "can't". Before I proceed, I should note that this fallacy is quite common in its more general form. For instance, does your doctor have to be a smoker to understand your problems as a smoker? Do you have to be disabled to understand a disabled person's problems? Could a Muslim scholar possibly know more about Jewish people's problems than your average Jewish person? For a researcher to write a paper on homeless children, does it require that she have been homeless as a child herself? But I don't think the mere experiencing of some issue, or familiarity with it, for instance me as a man being exposed to messages in the media about what a man should act like (e.g. not talk about feeling, etc) somehow makes me actually understand these problems. If so, then I would refuse to read a book written by a female psychologist who tries to help men understand their problems better. But I would read such a book if her claim to "understanding" is based on actual authority and expertise, having studied and conducted quality research the issue (there are other criteria too, but let's not get into that). In my view, it is also fallacious to talk about "girls problems" as if all girls shared the same ones. While there are naturally some similarities, there is also a lot of variation. Just as a black man in Manhattan has experience and understanding of racism that is likely different in important ways from a black man living in Freetown (Sierra Leone). In fact, what is more surprising to me is how often very similar people living in similar situation seem to have different perception and understanding of what seems to me to be the same problem. I like to end on a lighter note. It's not (generally) a crime to commit a fallacy. :) Sometimes people say one thing, mean another, and what we actually perceive is yet another thing. Language is not exact and people (myself included) are not very careful with what they say. It may be that the person here had none of this in mind and was just reacting to what may have been an unsympathetic comment. You're probably thinking, "Some lighter note...the guy ends by accusing me!" No, I'm just saying that whenever we analyze a fallacy based on a single comment, it's limited. We need context to truly understand the tone and intention. But as it stands, it can serve as an exercise in logic. It'd be fun to analyze political statements (which are much more carefully worded) and it's shocking how much fallacy is out there.
