Duality of material and immaterial is itself a debate, so this question begs that question ( as has been noted ). But, whether there be 'duality' of material and immaterial or not, what would seem to be separated by 'duality' and unified otherwise, is essentially the one reality of energy vibrating. Thought and space, emotion and matter, also are energy at a frequency of vibration. This goes deeply into many focuses and controversies - but it is self-evident1 - and yet subtle, and abstract. It can be osbscured. The way to access and interact with any world, phenomenological or otherwise, is the plane of energy and vibration which integrates and substantiates all else, whether that be perceivable or unmanifest. There will be a crying out for proof because of my assertion, I know, in times and places where energy and vibration is not a known or common state of being. Strangely, there is frequent use of the word "I" in these same times and places, by the same individuals who cannot find proof of energy and vibration. How the word "I" can be used with such fervency as if the word was defined and proven, is odd. Similarly, it is odd to many who do know the nature of energy and how to hold frequencies, how that reality is questioned, like "I" ought to be questioned, or "God" ought to be, as words legitimately used. The "God" and "I" presuppositions are secondary to a wider presupposition I pinpoint in my footnote. 

No. Because of insight. No. Because "it just came to me." ( said the genius ) The problem with insight as an exception to the premise of your question, is "in a flash" an entire problem or creation can be laid bare in the mind. Others may never reach the point of "productivity" inherent to who another individual "is," and if they did, it might take +1000x the energy expense. There is no level playing field in creation. Some creations are not the product of effort, but expressions of self. The expectation that energy is a requirement of creation is against the best of the best, and how their works result. And inversely to how eating an Apple burns more calories than it contains, with true creation, more energy is gained than is expended. And I am not reducing energy expenses to brain activity, or physical phenomena by mentioning an apple. I do not believe energy expense in creation and problem solving to be even minimally brain oriented. The brain is not where the work occurs, or where the energy is expended, it is an instrument. Yes, energy is expended there for the tool to function, but that is an entirely different item, completely irrelevant of the root and pertinent activity performed. No. Because hallucinogens would disrupt the entire basis of the math. It is a well known fact that the states entered by LSD, peyote, MDMA, DMT, psilocybin, etc... are game changers for those contemplating extremely complicated problems, or pursuing radically creative undertakings. Those same projects could take 100x the time and energy, or be unattainable without conscious expansion. And I'll sidestep the onrush of claims that hallucinogens are alterations and not standard-worthy factors here by saying, "you don't know what you don't know you don't know." If insight is a factor in energy expenditure, so are all other means of reaching a new conscious plane. No. Because time is relative, beyond the physical plane... and time is flexible. How fast is the energy expended? In an instant? How long is that instant? How much energy is expended during that interval of immeasurable time? The questions continue on and on, making quantifying energy expenditure impossible to calculate if time is ever a factor in the calculation, because the participant and observer in this experiment are both outside the frame of physical space and time, as much as they are in it. More than the doubt I raise, time is elastic, and the level of enjoyment and engagement modifies the amount expended. The "time flies when you're having fun" concept is not just figurative or subjective, there is a change that cannot be calculated, which alters the kind or amount of time and energy expended. It is on a level that blurs the line between environment and participant, and between participant and observer, and between energy and time, and between space and energy, and between energy and space, etc. "There is no spoon" is a show stopper for quantifying energy expense in creativity or problem solving. There is nothing to measure, statically. No. Because: Energy is Exogenous. No. Because: Energy is Endogenous. Depending on your perspective on the creation or problem, the location of the creation and the location of the energy are not within the same system always. This can go on forever, trying to enumerate the location where energy is expended and where creation results, but I will end this partial list by saying that the mind is one level of reality, one location for effort to take place. That draws energy from other levels and there is a rate of exchange there, and as I said above about creation being inverse to eating an Apply, that energy exchange itself might distort your calculation by comparing influxes of energy of an entirely different system with calculation based on a lower or different quality or nature of energy. 

This is a great question which calls into discussion the nature of groups at all. Systems are only organic ( natural and legitimately being ) if they are emergences. Morality only applies to groups, Ethics apply to individuals. The "moral code book" is only applicable to groups. So the situation is: can individuals act ethically, and the group behave immorally? Yes. However, in this case, the system is not longer emergent at that point, so in reality: No. This is similar to corporate law. If I incorporate a legal entity and work within the law, which is what makes the corporation legitimate, the corporation shields me from liability, and it directly "is." However if I violate my own bylaws and further distort the statutes which give corporations legal validity, it is not only that the corporation is in violation, it legally does not exist. Courts ( moral contexts ) will not grant the "being" of a corporation because its "being" is not in effect. Therefore the actions taken are my actions only, I am liable, and the entity is not even there in the situation, it is a non-entity. Trying to pry my self out of the metaphor here and return to the point: If the group behaves immorally by the ethical moves of its individuals, the group itself is not in existence any longer. It is now an illusory body which is not emergent, but divergent from the reality around it. It is a phantom. And not even in the way a cancer is not an organ of a body, or how a dream is not waking experience. Both those realities are more real than a group which is not emergent. A group which is not emergent is actually a force of will, it is a deception. It is an imposition of one group on another, even if that entails sub-groups having a war within one group ( which is not actually one group any longer ). So, the answer to your question is that when the group behaves immorally by the ethical moves of its individuals, the group no longer "is." 

And, of computers and computation: Lateral thinking and the counter-part in technology is also a road-block for quantifying what you want to measure, because the above negative answers also apply to programming. The programmer with a deeper or higher or lighter consciousness, whatever you want to call it, crafts a technology which is far more lateral than brute force in its execution and operation. Here again, there is no way to measure what cannot be statically defined, because it has to do with the nature of the creator, not the environmental factors, the tool operation cost, the circumstances, etc. The vast majority of what you want to measure is "behind the veil" of the self, or concealed by the inability to go into transcendence and return with "data." When the ego is lost and the love of the focus ignites, the individual changes into the creator, more than the creation is manifested. That is not costly, that is evolutionary. It is as if the field becomes the place where the creation originated, rather than the originated creation coming into being. The whole loops in upon itself at every point, which is immeasurable. The entire world has changed by the time the calculation is started, and again while it occurs, and again when it finished, and an infinite number of times in between those points. 

1. The self-evident nature of energy being the basis for all, is obscured by a single prevalent presupposition, not unproven. The conscious self is aware they are aware, and hence conscious. However if the awareness of a conscious self becomes preoccupied with another awareness, or their awareness becomes dissipated by an awareness which is not an awareness but a fixation on an error, that self is limited to the view of them self or the world that is allowed by the worse error, not the loudest truth. The truth can be used to remove the error, but the error, left intact, can also dismiss reality for that moment. Honesty is the courage to reverse the reversal of truth, usually, which involves deeply and widely questioning the otherwise obvious. But the fixation I will outline so wide-spread most individuals are not accustomed at all to being in any other frame of reference, or having any other state of being: There is a wide spread conviction that individual life is primarily physical or entirely physical, and that format of physicality is reality, which is caused and sustained ( it is an energy in vibration, and held to an extreme ) through calendrics. Calendrics is a specific form of chronomics, which is a form of language and communication and a way of understanding others, based on timing rather than symbols or semantics. The medium is the message, and the medium is: object ( "Earth" ) orbits ( "moves through space in an oval shape" ) around object ( "Sun" ). This introduces and sustains two objects and one answer for the meaning of life. An oval shaped journey measured as 365.2524 days and called a year. Currently there are only physically based calendrics in use in the established world ( in the most sustained and intently entrenched vibration of energy ). This produces physically focused adherents to a certain language of reality, and that language of reality is thus "truth." In other words, physical calendrics is "God" - that is the best definition of the word. Even "money" depends on calendrics. Also, calendrics is the entire underpinning of what is built upon that imposed group self-awareness / mythology, which is civilization / society ( note: not "community" which is not dependent on rule of law, which is dependent on calendrics - "to date" - as that is controlled by certain courts which exist at pre-decided times, in pre-decided places, chosen long ago and not questioned and replaced "to date" ). With every single voice in an argument agreeing on one thing, there is no real debate on anything else, only squabbling among people fundamentally agreed. Even if there were disagreement enough to cause all to part company ( physically ), there would still not be enough to force them from out of the same core group unless they also severed all other bonds, such as language, financial concepts, law, etc - and calendrics. Even if those of us on this thread share different views, we all share the same need ( not desire ) to adhere to a certain calendric. So though we may all disagree, only some of us might be able to actually know any other reality than the area in dispute. So there is no real way unless someone has a way to provide one, such as what I am doing here, to provide a way for the topic to exit a deadlock and be discussed without one core and all permeating presumption, obscuring all almost entirely. Again, there is not absence of proof or absence of self-evidence of energy vibration, there is inability to see through an obscurity. There are few communities and individuals who have overcome this difficulty, but it has been done. It is unpopular though, because it involves a total reconsideration of everything, including who one is. Especially who one is. Sadly, most prefer not to do that. 

is not an opinion or assertion, it is usually a choiceless verbal sneeze. is more like a hybrid physical-mental reflex than a decision to speak. "I am scared" or "I am uncomfortable" are some of the highest order propositions, invoking "I am" which is to say, "I am to be afraid," or "I am to be discomforted." Those are ultimate statements. Those declare a state of being... they look inside the self and return with a shipping manifest of internal cargo. is like yelling or screaming / shrieking except it is an English word, sort of. It's up there with or ... or or or ... you know, unfiltered emotional or mental statuses, often attached to some sort of physical event, or a tacit situational queue. About involuntary physical reactions, one which is less of a physical-mental hybrid can be sneezing and not get a ticket for some traffic violations because sneezing is largely involuntary. Similarly, the majority of uses of are without thought at all, and even take a lot of control to suppress. There is not really a value judgement being made, or a rendering of a feeling into words, like an "I am..." phrase. Usually isn't even really an utterance, it is not truly 'expressed' like may be, in anger.
