So the million is reached between generation 7 and 8. Which is 7.5 * 16 = 120 years But you could use a more "realistic" scenario, like not all the women have children, some children die before reaching reproduction age, some grandparents die early, and "only" 4 children by woman: 

This answer also is about terminal velocity, but just in the oposit way: Accelerate the medium in which the drop is falling Do you know these machines? 

In summary: you can make it much longer or much shorter. But around ten minutes seems reasonable in a big city, especially if the attacking army did choose on purpose a door which is far from the bells and the guard house. Final note: This answer is more of a hint on how to calculate it, so put your own numbers in it if you have some. Mines are just guesses. 

It’s very easy, poor mermaids. Acidification Search for all the trapped carbon on earth and below oceans, mostly in the form of petrol. Pump it, refine it and give it to everyone so that they can burn it to get energy. By doing so, they will release industrial level of CO2 in the atmosphere, thus leading to an acidification of the oceans. If the mermaids could survive it per se, it’s likely that their coral and forest homes will die, bleached out. Their food will disappear. They will get sick, starve and reproduce less. Eventually they’ll die out. Trawling You could also encourage heavy fishing with destructive means such as bottom trawling to accelerate the phenomena. Bonus As a side bonus, your civilization will prosper happily, with a nearly free source of energy and food (as long as they have another planet to go to if something unplanned goes wrong with the aforementioned plan). 

I am the multi trillionaire owner of Handwaveum Inc. who has always been fascinated with travel and living among the stars. I live in your near future where we have developed technology that allows us to finally colonize Mars! We can travel to and from Earth in a matter of months so while re-supply is possible rapidly responding to crisis will be difficult. We will have 200 intrepid volunteers who's job it will be to maintain the habitat for a period of 20 years to test the viability of colonizing the Red Planet. The habitat itself is a fully contained dome with about 1 square mile of space on the ground. The habitat will support life, crops, air, etc through the technology of Handwaveum and the monthly supply drops can bring in any other needed supplies to sustain life. My question is, what is the optimal mix of professions required for my volunteers to succeed living 20 years away from Earth on an inhospitable planet with only monthly supply drops to assist them? Assumptions: Professions existing in your 21st Century are sufficient. The volunteers will include individuals from Handwaveum that will be able to maintain the Habitat's advanced technology and should not count among the professional mix. The individuals will have a mixture of genders Individuals will live, work, play, and fully exist in an enclosed habitat for 20 years. Exit from the habitat is possible through air locks in space suits but there are no other habitable locations thus far on the planet. The mission is to conclude if a small number of humans can thrive in an enclosed environment such as the one described. The professional mixture should support this end. EDIT: As Alexander and pojo-guy have noted we here at Handwaveum Inc. have no desire for our intrepid explorers to feel cramped in their confines. We have (miraculously of course) expanded the habitat to a square mile of space (640 acres)! While the individuals will be getting regular supplies (including footstuffs) from the supply drops, they could certainly use some of the space for agricultural pursuits to supplement and augment the supplies received. 

Don't bother fixing things that will make no difference for 99% of pop Many of the previous answers are trying to remove stuff that are not useful. But, they are not really annoying either. I was never bothered by my caecum, were you? So if you remove it, you may save some small amount of energy/trouble for the body. But you could also later discover that, in the end, it had some purpose. Above all, you did something that will not make a noticeable difference in most of the cases. Mostly they are things that are not optimal, but their correction will not make the human more able for anything. Do you think your life quality would increase significantly if we fix the path of your laryngeal nerve? So what are the major defects in our bodies? Well, it's what kills us. Let’s take the most frequent mortality causes (in Europe): 

Basically, the more isolated from backup, and the more hostile to human life is the surrounding environment, the less you want randomness in your colony. So, you don’t want any little creature that can randomly create havoc in your colony. You are going to spray a lot of insecticide in your colony and vessels coming in, and bees are especially sensible to that. You don’t have bees, and other insects, simply because they are dangerous in a controlled environment and you don’t want them. It’s cheaper to import apples than to import replacements parts due to insect damage. 

If you're requiring everyone to work the same hours, one big detrimental effect is that everyone who relies on the previous shift would be unable to do their jobs. The hours when businesses are closed are times are when much of the cleaning, maintenance, repair, shipping, receiving, stocking, and processing goes on. Without that, employees who arrived in the morning would be idle until that work was done, businesses would not be able to function anywhere near capacity, and productivity would plummet. Another major detrimental effect would be that the entire consumer economy would be shut down. Since all the stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues (such as those soccer stadiums) would only be open while everyone was at work and couldn't go, no one would be able to spend money and all of those businesses would go bankrupt. Travel, transportation, and tourism would also be affected. Something would need to be done to support all those who previously worked multiple jobs or shifts, or worked nights/weekends because they were going to school or taking care of family. That would significantly impact whatever is in place to care for the poor. Interestingly, your exemptions of domestic workers, mom & pop firms & construction companies, sound like some of the ones that would be least affected. 

With a couple of changes to our perspective, it could be quite a bit lower than we would assume. We wouldn't need anywhere near as many different semiconductors as we have to be high tech. A lot of specialized chips could be replaced with general-purpose computing chips, perhaps with some inefficiency in size, speed, power usage, etc., but traded off against efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics and the number of people needed. If we didn't design everything to be disposable or for planned obsolescence, we wouldn't need to keep making new chips with trivial differences that in the end do the exact same things for the end-user. This needn't mean stagnation, innovation could be more significant though less frequent. Pharmaceuticals are largely driven by profit and guesswork. We could probably maintain tech levels but with a lot less complexity and people needed if we had better tech to know which medicines were needed (instead of the "try this and if it doesn't work we'll try something else" approach). Also if we were willing to accept some tradeoffs - many drugs are effective at treating multiple problems. In addition, a lot of the population does things that are not strictly necessary for maintaining a high-tech society but are a convenience or a luxury. While not everyone is going to want to be a research engineer, if we can reallocate over time and increase the ratio of population working on research, production, and development or the support thereof, we would need a lower population to sustain it. On a space colony, this would be a must. The way our economy is structured, with extreme specialization, it would most likely take millions or tens of millions or more. But if we made some tradeoffs for efficiency and generalization and restructured the economy to support it, then a population in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands (or possibly lower) could potentially work. (Once infrastructure is setup and automation applied where possible).
