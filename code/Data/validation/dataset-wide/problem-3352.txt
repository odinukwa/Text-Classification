It exists in Greek and Latin, and probably in most other Indo-European languages—at least in the ones I know: Dutch, French, German, Italian. In order to create an indefinite relative pronoun in Latin, one uses an extended form of the interrogative pronoun, doubling it, so quidquid instead of quid "what"; or one adds -cumque to the relative pronoun, so quodcumque instead of quod "(that) which". The indicative mood is used. Catullus describes how Egnatius is always grinning, whatever happens, Carmen 39, 5–7: 

In Latin, this is called the genitivus explicativus, definitivus, appositivus or epexegeticus: the genitive defines or describes in other words what the head word is or consists in (not consists of). It exists in various Indo-European languages, possibly in all, including Latin, Greek, German, English, Dutch, French... In languages without cases, a preposition meaning "of" is normally used instead of / as the genitive. $URL$ There is some connection with the genitivus partitivus, which describes what parts the head word consists of or includes: a box of matches, a cup of coffee, a regiment of archers. Note that most cases and prepositions have widely different meanings. The preposition of in English has always been strongly associated with the older genitive case (which developed into 's). Similarly, many other languages also have a preposition they strongly associate with the genitive: Dutch van, German von, (late?) Latin de. This strong association, which may have been already present, was often strengthened as languages lost their cases. There is also cross-contamination between languages: the Latin use of the genitive and de may have influenced that of the Germanic languages in the Middle Ages. But some uses of the genitive were most probably already present in Proto-Indo-European, like possession. The same applies to other cases and prepositions, to varying degrees. 

Is this a declaration? Does saying I apologise make the statement true? Can you say, he said "I apologise", but he did not in fact apologise? I think not, at least not in this context. You can apologise and not mean it, but that is different. It is also explicit because the whole utterance describes itself. 

If you Google for , you will probably find a whole lot more (though most of those Google hits are not it). 

This is also a declaration, since the utterance affects its own truth value as above. It is an explicit declaration, because the descriptive aspect describes the act brought about by uttering it. It can be tested thus. If someone else produced the same utterance, describing the same state of affairs but with appropriate deixis (= pronouns and tenses, words referring to the external world), as in he thereby dismisses you, she would accurately describe my performative utterance. The sentence I hereby dismiss you must therefore be an explicit declaration. A performative verb is short for a verb resulting in an utterance that is usually a declaration if you say I hereby [verb]. I say usually, because (almost) any sentence can be given a different illocutionary meaning given the right context. 

Going by the words you provided, you might need somewhere around 5000–8000 separate words in English, where inflected forms are counted as one word each. Your phrases or expressions will have to be extrapolated based on this. If you can give us a few more words that you think should be in one's vocabulary, and a few more that wouldn't, more precision could be achieved. But it is still a bit arbitrary, unscientific, and non-transferable to other languages... How your words rank in the list of most frequent words in TV and movie scripts (Wiktionary corpus): 

Is there any synchronic difference between homonymy and polysemy? As a literate English speaker, I can usually tell when words that are pronounced identically have different etymologies thanks to our wretched but etymologically informative spelling system. I know that "here" and "hear" come from different roots, for example, just as I know that "run" as in "I want to run away" and "run" as in "Dad runs the company now" come from the same root. But, as most of us know, children acquiring language don't have access to etymological information. So, spelling aside, is there any synchronic difference between homonymy and polysemy? One possible answer is that morphologically different words are synchronic homonyms rather than polysemous words. Consider "lie" (repose horizontally) and "lie" (use language to deceive). A naive person like me could argue that the two "lies" are synchronic homonyms and not one polysemous word because they inflect differently in past tense (lied, lay). But couldn't critic counter that "lie" meaning "present tense of lie.deceive" and "lie" meaning "present tense of lie.repose" are still examples of polysemy? What am I missing? 

e.g. "The man whom we confined has escaped. But do any natural languages mark the noun as being modified by a clause subsequent to the one in which the noun occurs and having the form of an independent clause, like so... e.g. The man(suffix indicates that the next clause modifies this noun) has escaped; we had confined him. 

In English, and no doubt in many other languages, instruments can be subjects. We can speak not only of John (an agent) cutting the canvas, but also of the knife (an instrument) cutting the canvas. As others have pointed out, though I can't find the exact reference, not every instrument can be a subject in English. We can cut paper with scissors, and scissors can cut the paper. On the other hand, we can eat soup with a spoon, but the spoon can't eat the soup. Hence we have a distinction between a secondary agent (the scissors, which do something caused or controlled by the agent) and a tool (the spoon, which helps the agent do something). My question is, are there languages in which instruments can't be subjects? For example, do languages with semantic alignment permit instrumental subjects? On a hierarchy of animacy, for example, "scissors" are much lower than first person, second person, and active beings like people and animals. So how could a word meaning "scissors" be a subject in such a language in sentences with active declarative meanings where nothing is marked with an inverse morpheme? 

About how much does language typology correlate with genetic relationships among languages? For example, should we expect most Sino-Tibetan languages to be isolating, or most Indo-European languages to have a lot of fusional affixes, and so on across language families? 

What are the most common reasons for (synchronic) word-order changes in isolating languages? From what I’ve read, word order in isolating languages can be changed even when the constituents in the resulting sentences have the same semantic roles as they do in the original sentences. By “semantic roles,” I mean relationships between agents, patients, etc., with respect to what the verb denotes. I’m trying to follow the SIL’s definition here: $URL$ For example, “The king helped the people,” and “The people were helped by the king” don’t have exactly the same meaning, but the constituents have the same semantic roles. In both sentences, the king is the agent, helping is the action, and people are patients. I suspect that there are a number of reasons for varying word order in an isolating language. In Chinese, for example, word order can vary in order to specify whether a given argument is definite. For instance, in Chinese “Lái rén le,” (come person perfect) means “Some person or people have come.” But “Rén lái le,” (person come perfect) means “The people (presumeably the expected people) have come.” The general rule, if I understand it correctly, is that clause-initial nouns tend to be definite, while non-clause initial nouns tend to be indefinite. See a little more about this Chinese grammar rule here: $URL$ English, my sole and native tongue, is pretty isolating compared to German, but the former has some grammatical constructions that allow for fronting constituents that normally occur after the verb. To put a focus closer to the front of a sentence, English speakers can do things like this: We saw Hector in the garden. a) It was Hector whom we saw in the garden. b) Seeing Hector in the garden is what we did. To topicalize non-subjects, we can front them like this: Rose drove a car. a) The car, Rose drove. b) As for the car, Rose drove it. Unfortunately, the examples I’ve shown here don’t tell me which kinds of word-order changes are the most common across isolating languages. What are the common trends? 

The only scientific reason I can think of is that the death of a language deprives us of interesting information that could be used to research universal grammar, etc. But the main reason is probably non-scientific, just as we don't like polar bears to go extinct or mediaeval churches to crumble: humanity has certain ideas about preserving the things it likes, and exotic languages are cool. 

Exposure: reading and listening and watching people speak in a foreign language. Active use: producing sentences in the language yourself. Interaction: getting immediate feedback in the form of a natural conversation. Speech: all of the above in speech (so not only in written communication). 

Since the one has an article, it seems fair to treat it like a (pro)noun, so it functions as a noun subject complement. For whom you are looking is as a whole a relative clause modifying the one, so I would make it one branch from the "predicate nominative" down, so the two branches would be the one and for whom you are looking. Then I would probably branch off whom (the relative pronoun) on the one hand and you are looking for [zero] on the other; but there is something to be said for doing for whom v. you are looking. The problem is that whom is both the object of the preposition for and the node that introduces the relative clause. This below website uses a "silent complementiser that" for my [zero], which seems contrived (the word that is not possible in that sentence), but do with it what you will. It seems clear that you need to add a node for this [zero], whatever you call it. Perhaps look into wh-movement for English. An example of how they parse relative clauses: 

One should keep in mind that phonemes which sound very similar to a foreigner may sound very different to native speakers. For example, I once pronounced Navarra as Navara in Spanish, and my Spanish friend had no idea at all what I was talking about. After my third try (it was admittedly in a noisy bar), he said, "ohh, you mean Navarra! Then why didn't you say so?" To me, r and rr sound like the same phoneme—but certainly not to Spaniards. It depends on how many relevant minimal pairs there are in the target language. If there are many words, or a few very frequent words, in which only [e] and [ɛ] are different, it will be more difficult to understand for the native speaker if one is used for the other. It also depends on whether the native speaker is aware of the fact that the foreigner is apt to confuse these two phonemes. For example, since the Romance accents in English are fairly well known, an Englishman will not be misled as easily if a Frenchman keeps confusing this (/ðɪs/) and these (unaccented before consonant: something like /ðis/). And there are probably more factors to consider. 

The conjugation of a verb can mean two things: 1.) All the finite forms of a verb. 2.) All the inflected forms of a verb, including non-finite forms, like the infinitive and participles. I believe this usage is more common. A finite form of a verb is one that has an ending; conventionally, the suffixes used to form infinitives (what's in a name?) and participles are not considered endings, although one might question the rationale behind this. A verb ending is normally that part of a verb which expresses the features person and number (and usually mood). That is, a non-ending normally cannot express person or number or mood; but an ending can express more than person and number and mood (such as tense). You could say endings that express more than person, number, and mood are a contraction of some suffix with an ending, like the Latin imperfect (e.g. stabam, "I stood"), which is either analysed as present stem + imperfect suffix -ba- + ending (sta-ba-m), or as present stem + imperfect ending (sta-bam). We usually say the tense is included in the ending in such cases, of which there are many, but in other situations it is more practical to treat the suffix or contraction as a separate morpheme. Strictly speaking, an ending / finite form is a kind of inflected form (finite inflexion), and an inflected form is a kind of suffixed form. Often, but not always, we use suffix to mean "non-inflexional suffix", because we already call inflected forms "inflected"— although inflected forms are also said to have inflexional suffixes in some contexts. "Inflected forms" normally does include all finite forms / endings. Tense is a difficult concept of which different people use different definitions. An ending can be said to express tense, although there are endings that do not express tense. The forms of the Greek optative, for example, are always finite, but they never express a tense, while the endings of the imperfect do express tense (even though they are always finite too). Luoi = "may he unbind" (optative), which can be used in present, future, or past sentences alike, i.e. there is no real tense in it. Aspect can be expressed in suffixes, in (suppletive) stems, in additional words, but also in endings, if you consider something like -bam above to be a single morpheme.
