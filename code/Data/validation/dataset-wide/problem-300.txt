Someone rich enough to have a plate-sized emerald on the chest of their ceremonial armor has no place on the front line anyhow. Usually, such armor is the domain of kings, who would not wander onto the battlefield without a guard of hundreds surrounding them on all sides. The role of the person such in ceremonial armor on the battlefield is two-fold: 

While it's generally true that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, it's not like guns grow out of thin air either. In an industrial world it is usually it is the more economically potent that can amass the resources to build the military infrastructure and political network to further their influence in the world. There are however several exceptions to this rule, as in our modern world there are countries that have had their military ambitions crushed in world wars and have for a long time been effectively protectorates (in all but name) of one superpower or another. Germany and Japan have long been quiescent on the world stage, generally preferring to stay in the shadow of the superpower. Such a situation is however unlikely to persist for long, and indeed we see that in recent decades, both powers have shifted towards a more self-assertive military and political stature. So to answer the question: yes, but such a situation is generally unlikely to persist, especially outside of a exteremely polarized 2 superpower world context. 

Use the same way people handle our ever-changing aerial continents - a daily weather report. Think about it: the oceans of cold and warm air, loaded with water or dry, move about great distances every day. Just touch the I̶P̶h̶o̶n̶e̶ Magical Slab, and images appear and a voice speaks: 

Imagine the speed of light is 100 times that in our universe. Light from the moon takes about 1/100th of a second, the sunlight reaches our eyes in about 4 seconds, from nearby Alpha Centauri in about 16 days, and from the galactic center in about 260 years. Assuming the laws of relativity would be scaled up to the higher value of $c$, would that make it easier to travel to other worlds? Besides being awesome, would there be any other important considerations that I should keep in mind? Edit: In light of the first few responses, if at all possible, I would like to assume scenarios where the universe does not burn down horribly. But perhaps such a fast propagation of causality leaves me with no outs... 

Must be perceivable, and if possible by multiple people simultaneously. Must be immaterial in some sense (i.e you probably should not be able to grab it by the collar) Nonetheless, I would like my ghosts to be able to generate sound. Must resemble some formerly living person in some essential aspect (visage, patterns of behavior, speech if possible). I would love it if they were partially sentient/aware and thus interactive and endowed with a deceased person's memories (at least up to a point), so they would (mis-)recognize people and could be persuaded to share their secrets. This is not vital, but if they need to be killed put to rest, I would love for a way to do so. 

2 Minute Version: "And as my third wish, I desire a complete implementation of a Kardashev Type II industrial infrastructure around the planet's primary." Harry Potter Version: "Manufacturo perpetuum mobile!" Dark Satanic (mana-)Mills version: A century at most. Presumably, mana can be harnessed with high efficiency compared to steam or solar power by a previously agrarian civ. Moreover, magic can be used to refine tools, including tools that make magic more powerful. Since the mana resource does not need to be mined, and needs no infrastructure to develop, the magic-driven industrial revolution can proceed at accelerated pace. Even if magic is hard to master, schools of Thaumaturgic Engineers will start churning mages out on industrial scales. The artefacts they create will soon pervade every household, improving productivity at rates undreamt by our measly coal-driven industrial revolution. The only source of concern would be the social implications. How quickly would these Engineers take power, and how would the reactionary forces react against them? Think the French revolution at 10x speed. 

The year is 2120, and the world is (depressingly/refreshingly) similar. Sure, techonology has advanced and there are flying cars, trains run through voided tunnels at 1000 mph and scramjets take the rich from Canberra to New York in 2 hours, and our virtual personal assistants ("Jeeves") often appear smarter than their owners. The unemployment rate hovers at a steady 70%, but with all the automation and the universal guaranteed personal income, that's not as terrible a thing as one might think. True Artificial Intelligence has proven elusive, and after (what even later history books would call) the War of the Lesser Abominations, AI research is at this point forbidden across most of the civilized regions of the planet, and a well-funded AGI Taskforce roams the slumlands hunting out rouge AI developers. The one notable feature of this world that I'm interested in for the purpose of this question is that most people can expect to live to 200 years, with life expectancy growing at just under 1 year per year for much of the past century. Dementia, cancer, heart disease are quaint things of the past century, with suicide, accidents, and engineered viruses now the largest killers by far. What would the implications of a 200 year lifespan be? I'm thinking specifically: a) Career - would getting multiple phds become the norm for a well-educated member of the body economic (a.k.a. any employed person)? Would career progression be stifled by dinosaurs that won't retire or would innovation be instead boosted by the extra willingness to devote a decade or two to a risky project? b) Family life - would dating one's grandchildren's friends be regarded as normal, and would marriages become limited-duration contracts? c) Is there anything major that I'm overlooking? Yes, I'm aware of the concept of undying tyrants, and will not be pursuing it directly here. 

It finally happened. The inhabitants of Metropolis, the capital of Our Nation, have finally had enough of the swampy lands, suffocating summers, freezing winters, spring floods, risk of surprise invasion by sea and whatever other nastiness the local geography had in store for them. They have decided to move Metropolis. Since Our Nation is a glorious empire with vast, vast resources at our disposal, we will literally uproot the entire city and move it some place we like better (about 161 km away -- 100 miles away). How do we go about moving a city of 5 Million? How much time, how much energy would it take? Can it be done in bulk, whole blocks at a time? Can you literally float it, in the air or on a river? A few details: 

Deserts and high mountains means sailing not roads are main transportation Well, you need to consider a few additional factors. When they hear Pangeea, people tend to think of a lush luscious continent full of forests and fertile plains. In fact, as you can see from the map below, there is a vast and foreboding Central Pangean Mountain Chain that made the Himalayas look like a joke. Moreover, they were set across the equator ripping apart monsoon-like winds, driving vast desert belts to the north and south. This is actually good news for your empire, because it means that, just like the Roman empire (which is famous for Roads but was actually kept alive by grain shipments across the Mediterranean) this will likely be based on shipping around the vast and sheltered Tethys Ocean and the mini-continents that surround it. Again, shipping can carry a larger volume of news, goods and people faster (~130 miles per day according to my source) 

Which one of these (if any) is most likely to be the preferred path, and why? If you think another outcome is more likely, I would like to hear it instead. 

Wearable and implantable technologies are increasingly blurring the line between natural and augmented reality. Currently, our commercially available computer-aided vision systems for the blind are barely capable of providing a blurry, black-and-white low res rendering at relatively high cost (~$250k). However, progress in the field is starting to look increasingly exponential, which brings to my mind questions about the potential use of vision systems for healthy humans. Unaided human vision is limited to about 120 degrees per eye, most of it peripheral, with only a narrow 6 degrees of high-resolution vision (the macula). Perhaps we would be able to use an array of cameras (placed on a helmet or a band, say), connect them to a specially designed computer processor and then feed them into a brain implant that would provide a feed of the information to our visual centers. Is it possible to create an artificial vision system with high-res depth-of-field-capabilities, 10-100x on-thought zoom (the machine will zoom as you think you want to zoom), blending several perceptual modes (passive visual, EM, IR, UV, and why not, active X-ray) and spanning the full 360 degrees something a man-machine system could send to the visual centers and have a user experience consciously? Note that I'll judge answers on whether the feasibility of such a device is addressed, as well as the two criteria below: Usability: Would a human be able to train herself to experience this, or would we have to strap them onto newborns or genetically engineer ourselves for it? Usefulness: Would something like this be useful for anyone besides guards and ornithologists? 

Why does reciting a creature's T̸̊ͬ̃͟ř̡̓ͪͥ͌ͦ̀͘ú̷̧̇ͮ̐̒͝e̓ͮ͐̽͐̽͋͆͏ ́Ņ̵̵͋̒̐̊̽â̓ͪ̈̈́mͦ͐̅ẽ̂̐͗̑ͪ͐̕͜҉ in the ur-language of Adamic grant such power over them? Answers will be judged based on plausibility. Specifically, given that demons are probably at least as smart as humans, why would they just have such a vulnerability? I'd prefer a solution involving as little magic as possible, ideally none. 

I've taken the liberty to provide a slightly more general answer. It also answers your question along the way: Early Stage Colonies (Mars population <50,000) would be incredibly dependent on Earth, and therefore could not afford to risk ending the supply of cargo from Earth. The industrial chains leading to the production of advanced electronics and machinery would likely remain for a long time outside the reach of a colony. Mars would still be under more or less direct Earth control. Asteroid attack chance: N/A, far beyond colonist capabilities. Probably no orbital access. Late Early Stage (50k < Mars population < 1m) With increasing population, limits on the Earth's Mission Control's capacity to micromanage the affairs of the colonists would likely become apparent. Expect shortages in supply, Martian radicals agitating for independence, extensive mining, the first locally built nuclear reactors, early industrial plants and the first massive infrastructure projects (such as space elevators and giant domes, in the dozen km radius range). At this stage the Martian colonists are most likely to rebel, and most likely to be crushed. Lack of adequate industrial and space infrastructure would likely mean limited orbital capacity, limited manufacturing ability, and limited force-projection capability. Their fragile, easily depressurized habitats are a further handicap. This is likely where the asteroid attack attempt would occur. The asteroid has near zero chance of damaging Earth, of course, since Earth has a larger nuclear arsenal, a larger space fleet, early warning due to distances and superior intelligence networks, and the manufacturing capability to respond effectively to telegraphed threats of this nature (with months to prepare, countermeasures would be developed and implemented) Mature Colony With a population approaching 10 million, a mature Martian colony would be completely unmanageable from Earth due to the sheer size and complexity of the Martian economy. Since Mars has a permanent labor deficit, the degree of robotization, AI-control and labor-saving technologies in general will be unimaginable by Earth standards, where with 10 billion humans, labor will remain relatively cheap for the foreseeable future. This will have likely given the Martians an immense technological edge in the relevant fields, while the 'frontier' environment will have engendered an openness to daring projects not seen on the Homeworld since the closing of the American West. Martian per capita GDP is similar to that of Switzerland, and growing at a rate of 40% per earth-year, a rate unimaginable on the NIMBY Earth. Slowly, the "Martian Burden" as Earth-politicians will have called the immense investments required to sustain the Martian project in its Early decades, will gradually dwindle, as more and more, the technology flows become reversed, and Martian businessmen and entrepreneurs share of total new Intellectual Property approaches 5%, a 50-fold over-representation of the Martians. Their wealth and influence growing, the Martians achieve through economic strength what their rebellious parents could not by force of arms: self-representation, and a seat in the highest decision-making councils. Asteroid attack success chance: High. Orbital capability is in place, secure communications and counter-intelligence probably in place. However, use is unlikely since in a vast majority of conceivable scenarios sovereignty would have been devolved to the Martians at this point, and Earth still holds a 500:1 industrial advantage Homeworld With Martian population stable around 40 million, a population density around 0.3 Martians/sq.km, Martians decide by a slim margin to limit any further colonization by the disease-infested short people that swarm the Earth, with the occasional exception made for outstanding scientists working at Earth-branches of the major Martian corporations. Earth's opinion on the matter is irrelevant, since the Martians have a significant technological lead, a near-complete domination in terms of advanced ship technology, and own a majority of the solar space fleets, Asteroid belt mining stations and all three major space elevators on Earth. Earth is engulfed in a dark age due to massive planetary unrest by hyper-conservative Hindutva, Junzi, Quiverful, Mormon, Wahhabi and Hassidic fundamentalists that comprise nearly half of the population, and can spare little attention to distant space concerns. Asteroid attack success chance: Overwhelming. Martians and their Asteroid belt colonies dominate the solar system, with a massive space infrastructure lead on the still-divided Earth nations. Would be considered a low-tech solution, as Martian 'Mining' ships at this stage have mass accelerators that can dispatch 1-10 ton projectiles at a significant fractional $c$. Moreover, while Earth's economy is still over a dozen times larger, Martian GDP per capita is about 30 times larger. An attack would be pointless. More likely to send humanitarian assistance.
