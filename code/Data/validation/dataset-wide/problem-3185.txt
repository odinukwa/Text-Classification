Without you narrowing down your inquiry further though it is tough to know what specific areas to hit upon. However, those topics about Socrates, the Suda, and later Byzantine Greek scholarship were the first things to come to mind when I read the OP. Perhaps this will be of some assistance. 

Though the title may be vaguely broad, I have two specific things in mind I wanted to ask about. While I was recently considering the cultural and technological advancements of Europeans in the early Middle Ages, which was soon to be spread by them to the New World, I also began to consider Islamic history and cultural advancement at that same time (especially - for them - in areas of science, literature, and mathematics), and particularly in North Africa where some of the the Portuguese had contact and intermingled with Muslims through trade. So along parallel historical tracks I began to wonder at the comparative development between Renaissance Era European culture and Islamic culture at that time, and pursuant to that a few unusual questions arose in my mind. In particular I was wondering about two innovations of the Europeans of which I have never heard mention of their first use in the Islamic world (in terms of their initial adoption, though of course in the modern world there is hardly any distinction now): Firstly, use of the printing press; and secondly, the use of canvas (hemp-weaved) for painting (which first took off in Italy). In terms of technological advancement I'd say the former is more significant and utilitarian, while the argument about the "sophistication" of using canvas for art seems more subjective and preference driven (whatever its actual practical and aesthetic advantages may have been), though I still am curious about it. So to plainly state my two questions: 

Most of the evidence that Stanton said the quote in question comes from Pershing himself, who denied that he authored the phrase. 

Compare it with the Coat of Arms of the Netherlands. Notice the similarities between the lions. Much of the similarities between these different lions could be because the same artist drew them. By this, I do not mean the originals. The copies can have great variances in details if they remain depicting the same objects. You explained yourself why many display lions: 

This is basically oblique order. The idea is to crush one flank of the enemy with the strong force, turn it 90° and defeat the enemy in detail. The remainder of your troops keep the enemy busy on the other flank. You put your heavy troops on the strong flank because they need the most strength (they need to break the line). The light troops are more useful for skirmishing. Their job here is to keep the enemy occupied. If the enemy penetrates your skirmishers, it is all over for your army. If the enemy realizes that your army is employing this tactic too soon, they will all fall on the strong flank and it will be crushed. This technique was first used in Greece in the third century BC, but was most famously used by Frederick II of Prussia. Napoleon greatly admired Frederick II, and it is more than conceivable that Napoleon developed these tactics directly from him. 

When was the first recorded use of a printing press in Muslim lands? (Note: I am not asking what the first Islamic book printed on a printing press was, given that it might very well have been from a printing press operating in Europe. I want to know about actual adoption of the printing press in Muslim lands.) What is the oldest known Islamic work of art composed on canvas? 

In terms of broadcast technologies, which was seen as more revolutionary for its time: television or radio? How was each technology utilized in terms of its intended purpose and audience/users in its earliest years? And were telecom companies its earliest providers, presumably having already provided telephone services and telegraph long before that? Also, was the invention of broadcast technologies seen as a surprising and significant development from prior point-to-point communications like telegraph and the telephone, or was it more of an expected logical progression from those precursor technologies? Lastly, many communication technologies seemed to be developed for government or military purposes first and only later considered for public use. Was the same the case for either radio or television? I'm trying to get a feel for how it impacted the societies in the era they were each invented, including early adoption and enthusiasm surrounding their use. 

Adolf Hitler's goal in life was initially to become an artist. However, the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna denied Hitler's admission twice, in 1907 and 1908. 

Hiroshima, the first city, was "an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focussing[sic] effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target. (Classified as an AA Target)" [1]. There were also four other possible targets: Kokura, Niigata, Yokohama, and Kyoto. There were three criteria for choosing targets: 

Although this statue has no openings for the rites described, it would be something similar to this statue. However, there has been little to no evidence found of this idol by archaeologists. It is hard to say what exactly it looked like as most sources only state the arms and and a fire inside. The main civilization to document first-hand these were the Greeks. As far as I can tell, there are no known existing braziers of this description. This is not to say they never existed. Carthage was razed in the Third Punic War and the idols would have gone with it. So it is rather indecisive what they looked like, but I've listed here what information has been documented. 

A stele was found in the area of ancient Moab from the 12th century B.C. during Pharaoh Rameses II's domination of Canaan, which depicts a local ruler flanked by two (possibly Egyptian) gods, and the stele is made in imitation of the Egyptian style. 

It may be taken for granted now that Islamic countries use both, but since they appear to be exclusively European innovations at that time of the Renaissance Islamic adoption of it must have been taken from them at some later time. Islamic art was of course prolific at that time, but I've never heard of Islamic use of canvas during the Middle Ages, for example. Also, although I am especially interested to know the answer to those questions specifically in instances outside of the European continent, in terms of spread of influence I have to wonder if the Muslim held portions of Spain during the Renaissance Era were perhaps the earliest adopters of those technologies for printing and art. Can anyone provide at least a rough guess for when those two things first appeared in the Muslim world, even if we do not know the actual earliest instances precisely? 

This is additional corroboratory evidence that the Egyptians successfully introduced their religion to their Canaanite vassals, and the Balu'a Stele is most likely evidence of that in Moab as well. As for additional reading on Chemosh, in a discussion I had with the Hebrew scholar Gershon Galil about a Moabite seal of a ruler bearing a theophoric element of Chemosh's name, through his Facebook page (possibly viewable to the public here), he told me: "For Chemosh see Müller, Hans-Peter. "Chemosh." Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible. Edited by Karel van der Toorn, Bob Becking, and Pieter W. van der Horst. 2nd ed. Leiden: Brill, 1999, 186-189." I hope that helps. 

To sum it up, about seventy pounds has always been considered a decent load range, but the average infantryman can carry more. However, during battle, when troops need to move faster, it is common to lessen the required load. Sources

A low estimate would be 1.5 billion gallons (assuming 20 percent full at time of wreck). A reasonable average would be 3.8 billion gallons of oil spilled in maritime waters during World War 2. This estimate includes both military vessels and non-military vessels sunk during World War 2. It does not include oil spilled in rivers or freshwater lakes.

There are a few flaws in this conclusion. First of all, the text in all caps is just wrong. The church had the New Testament from the time it was written. Quoting Wiki here, 

Edit: Now that the OP question has been reworded for clarity I will tip my hat to pokep as being closer to answering the intent of the inquiry. It was not clear to me originally where orality and myth came into the picture with literature in the question. Nonetheless, I'll leave my answer here in case it helps anyone. I'm afraid you're probably not going to get away without doing some research of your own on this, but perhaps some pointers could help. Firstly, since you give such generous leeway with respect to the period of time under consideration (from the lifetimes of the ancient philosophers up to the Middle Ages) I feel at liberty to jump around a little bit. Firstly, from your title alone ("How much of what we know about ancient philosophers comes from oral literature?") I immediately thought of the matter of Socrates and what we know of him and how we know it. We have no writings from Socrates himself, and are dependent largely on Plato for telling us what Socrates taught. That in itself presents us with a dependence on orally transmitted details about a person of a truly ancient provenance (almost from the get go). So oral transmission of knowledge about a person need not be something long after the fact and also need not be inherently suspect or inaccurate. It seems ironic, however, that the historicity (existence) of Socrates as a person and the essential content of his teachings are rarely called into question, despite us having no written records from him personally; yet all the while some "mythicists" call into the question the historicity of Jesus of Nazareth and his essential teachings (which also relies on sources that provide orally transmitted details from early witnesses who knew him personally, rather than from any direct writings by him). The same can be said for Siddhārtha Gautama (Buddha). There are good reasons to regard them all as real historical figures whose teachings have reached us accurately by their ancient witness-bearers who wrote them down. To take one ancient example from the Hellenistic world, the fields of New Testament studies (in the case of Jesus and early Christian history - as Koine Greek speakers and/or writers), Orality, Textual Transmission, and Historiography are all even disciplinarily related - resting upon the same historiographical foundations and inquiries - to this same question you raise about orally transmitted details of ancient figures and their teachings. The questions and methodological principles for analyzing such orally transmitted accounts (especially in such a largely oral culture) applies equally to New Testament studies and the study of any Greek or Roman literature or historical sources in general. So studying orally transmitted details about Greek Philosophers will involve the same interdisciplinary considerations to determine historicity. The field of study on those topics of orality and historiographical textual studies is vast, and I have seen much discussion of it in NT studies (which is why I mention it), and no doubt broader studies on Greek literature and historical sources may be found which would apply to Greek Philosophers. I would just recommend spending time on a search engine, journal aggregate sites like JSTOR (which now provides some limited free access), or book catalogues such as WorldCat searching for keywords like "Orality" and "Greek literature" or "Greek History" (Substitute "Hellenistic" for "Greek" where appropriate) and start where you can. Further, aside from such foundational matters, if you wish to find a good compendium of ancient knowledge about all manner of elements of Greek and Roman culture and language as understood by a later civilization, the Byzantines, then I recommend doing some research on the Suda. This may help bridge the gap from classical times to the Middle Ages, as you discussed. As Wikipedia states the Suda "is a large 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world". It is part lexicon and part encyclopedia but presents a broad understanding of knowledge of the classical world, and may provide you some clues for what you endeavor to research. I often see it cited in academic literature when someone is debating the meaning of Greek words in classical literature (often as applied to exegetical analysis of Greek texts), but it also provides some details of ancient knowledge and facts as understood at the time. As the Wikipedia article states: 

This is a rather long answer outlining the strengths and weaknesses of various nations' midget submarine fleets. If you just want the short answer, skip to the last paragraph. During World War II, the UK, Italy, Germany, and Japan had midget submarines. The US, the USSR, and China did not. The Royal Navy had two main submarines. The X-class submarine was built from 1943-1944, eventually replaced by the XE-class submarine. 20 X-class submarines and at least twelve XE-class submarines were built. There were also a few unsuccessful submarines, such as the Sleeping Beauty and the Welman submarine. Six of the X-class were lost in battle and one in training. Another six of the X-class were training-only. The operational X-class were mainly used in preparatory work such as taking surveys of Normandy beach and cutting torpedo nets in harbors. However, six were used in Operation Source to neutralize German warships. All but two of the submarines involved were lost in this operation. XE-class submarines were used similarly. However, only four of them ever saw action. In 1945, they were used to cut Japanese telephone cables off the coast of Vietnam and China. 

These were by far faster than any other midget submarine sailing at the time. Few could go over 10 knots. These were comprised of one main type- the Ko-hyoteki Class Submarine. It was subdivided into three types: A, C, and D. Five type A participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor, but only two made it into the harbor and none survived it. Three type A attacked Sydney Harbor in 1942, but one was sunk before it could do damage. The other two survived but sank before they could return to their transport submarines. They damaged only one ship however. Two type A's also took part in the Battle of Madagascar. One was lost at sea and the other seriously damaged one battle ship and sank an oil tanker. Type D's were mas produced-- even more than the type A's and type C's. 115 type D's were completed by the end of the war and almost five hundred more were under construction. The Ko-hyoteki also played a defensive role in the Aleutians and alsewhere in the Pacific. To put a conclusion on this lengthy answer, I would say the Japanese had the best midget submarines. However, the Germans had the best program as the Japanese did not often utilize their fleet in important offenses. 

I'm a little surprised that no one has mentioned, among the various theories so far, the possibility of the figure of King Arthur being (at least loosely) based upon the military leader Riothamus. Whether or not Arthur was real and the stories about him true or embellished, there are - as another answerer said - "plenty of theories regarding the existence of such a person". At least one worth mentioning, which I first learned about from watching a documentary on the subject, is that Arthur was Riothamus. I will leave the following quote from Wikipedia to speak for itself: 

So the Egyptianization of the region may have contributed to early Moab's religion and pantheon. Archaeologist Gabriel Barkay in the article "What's an Egyptian Temple Doing in Jerusalem?" (Biblical Archaeology Review Vol 26 No 3 May-June 2000), wrote about the presence of an Egyptian Temple in Jerusalem during the Canaanite/Jebusite occupation of the city, before the Israelites conquered it and supplanted it with monotheistic worship of Yahweh in Solomon's Temple. Noting a number of artifacts present he mentions some pottery dating to the 18th dynasty of Egypt: 

One Byzantine churchman and scholar who wrote widely on Greek classics and also made reference to the Suda was Eustathius of Thessalonica. In the Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece by Nigel Wilson (pg. 60) it says: 

Ba'al is a Northwest Semitic title applied to many gods of the region. The one I believe you are referring to is Moloch. Here is a exaggerated description of him by Gustave Flaubert, written in 1862. Although it is is not first-hand, he did visit Carthage to research and gather material for it. 

Roman Infantry There were two types of Roman infantry: the light and the heavy infantry. The average heavy infantryman had a helmet, a mail coat, greaves, a shield, a spatha(broadsword), five weighted darts, and a javelin (pilum). The pilum was five to six feet long with a tip of iron, weighing nine ounces. The total weight of the pilum ranged between five and eleven pounds (the pilum were heavier in the days of the republic than of the empire). The shield could weigh over twenty pounds. The light infantryman carried much of the same items. However, he rarely wore armor. His sheild was smaller and usually made of wood. Instead of using pilum, the light infantrymen carried hastae velitares. They were smaller and lighter than the pilum. Many light infantrymen also carried a gladius as a backup weapon. In addition to their weapons, each infantryman carried spare clothing, a cloak, three to fourteen days of rations, a wicker basket for moving dirt, rope, a waterskin, and a spade or a pick ax. These were attached to a cross-shaped frame, forming a pack. The light infantry usually ended up carrying 70-80 pounds of equipment and the heavy infantry often carried up to 100 pounds of equipment.
