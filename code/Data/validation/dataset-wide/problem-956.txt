Which is very small, in fact about a 0.4% of the radiative forcing associated to CO2 (see figure below): 

GPS units require a clear view of the sky to fix their position. Because unlike radio signals used for communications, once the GPS signal have bounced in a wall becomes useless for computing the receiver's position. Therefore, the GPS would loss fix shortly after entering the pothole. The studies made in the area that determined the point at which the water reenters the river, claim that the flow of water keep objects at the bottom of the pothole, explaining why they never resurface. So there is a high chance that you wouldn't see your GPS ever again. However, if your GPS were to resurface, it would fix its position again soon after regaining a clear view of the sky. So, if you recover it (or if it had the capability to transmit its position in real time), you won't see a record of the track followed by the device, you would see only the entry and exit point. For such problems, similar to a car going trough a tunnel, the GPS is usually augmented with inertial navigation systems that can estimate the displacements and compute the position by dead reckoning from the last GPS fix. Despite that the turbulence within the water flow in the pothole would make very challenging to keep track of the trajectory of the device underground, a sophisticated enough device should be able to do it. 

The image is real, and the clouds are moving, they just move slow, as clouds do. These images are real, but the unnatural appearance arise because they are taken by DSCOVR at an extraordinarily large distance, from a place called L1, more than one million kilometers away!!!. The rotation of the Earth in the animation makes it difficult to distinguish the movement of the clouds, but if you just track one single area as shown in the animation below, the movements of the clouds becomes evident: 

You can easily achieve that assuming that there is no sources of water vapour inside, so the absolute humidity (mass of water per volume of air), remains constant. This excerpt from my undergrad tesis will explain the formula for absolute humidity Once you know the absolute humidity, you can adapt the same formula to calculate the relative humidity of a parcel of outside air (of now known content of water), that is taken from outside to inside a building where its temperature risen to a new value. If we add subscripts "e" to exterior temperature and relative humidity and "i" for interior ones. Most of the constants can be dropped and the interior relative humidity would be given by 

It is hard to help unless you clarify what methods have you tried. However, I would suggest to explore reanalysis weather models, as they are the most accurate source of estimated weather conditions worldwide in the past. A recommended reanalysis is ERA-interim, starting in 1979 so it gives you 39 years, if you really need 40 you can use JRA-55 that starts on 1955. The KNMI Climate Explorer is a great way to retrieve and plot data from those models. If you get in there you can set it to plot monthly mean temperatures for a given location. Here is an example of somewhere in SW Canada: 

Where the red shading show the areas that are visible from the tower. The rest of the terrain would be hidden behind topographic obstacles. 

To avoid gluing, some people choose aluminium or stainless steel electrodes, that are affordable and do not suffer much of chemical corrosion. Some of the data that was produced by this probes were used for this publication. Many comercial setups use three or four electrodes. I don't understand all the advantages of those sensors. In some cases they are just multiple sensors each one calibrated for a specific range. I've also seen three concentric electrodes. I haven't do the math, but my suspicion is that they measure the current in two independent electrodes with different surface area. Then, you can model and calculate the resistivity of the layer of deposits/corrosion that covers the electrodes and compensate your reading accordingly, reducing the calibration drift issues. 

Erosion rates measured in outlet glaciers in Patagonia and other areas in different timescales. From figure 2.a in "The relative efficacy of fluvial and glacial erosion over modern to orogenic timescales" 2009, Nature Geoscience 2(9):644-647. The reason that explain why Fjords can become deeper than that one kilometer estimate, is the concentrated erosión in outlet glaciers at the edge of the ice sheet. For example, the most visited glacier in the Northern Patagonian Icefield: the San Rafael glacier, show erosion rates of 0.83 mm/year. And as shown in the figure above, outlet glaciers can erode up to ~5 cm/yr at shorter timescales. Sumarizing: Northern Patagonian Ice Field's fjords started to form with the first Pleistocene glaciation at the begin of the Quaternary about 2.6 million years ago, but they have become deeper after each successive glaciation and they are still forming today. Current glaciers are eroding their bedrock at rates on the order of one to a few centimeters per year. 

And again I didn't found anything. Therefore I'm inclined to think that there is nothing. But I can't rule out that something very small can be hidden by the clouds. However, I doubt it. If you want to perform the search yourself over a larger search radius, just let me know and I can give you the images. I also searched the seamount catalog for those coordinates and the only one that show up is Vlinder Guyot about 224 km to the East. So there is no information on the one below your mystery island. However, in this publication. It is refereed as "I'l Ichev" and is part of the "Magellan Seamounts". 

(vascular plants biodiversity map from Hamburg University) If an actual number wants to be calculated based on actual data, the GIS datasets at biodiversitymapping.org are a great resource. Perhaps one argument in favour of the biomass interpretation of the claim, is that it would be a much easier and better constraint calculation. 

Radiation: The object will cool down emitting electromagnetic radiation (mostly infrared) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Conduction: As the object get hotter than the surrounding air, it will loose heat by thermal conduction into it. 

(Figure taken from here) Let's now consider the more realistic case, on which there are other "polutants" that can break down ozone. The moste common ones are hydroxyl radical (OH·), nitric oxide radical (NO·), chlorine radical (Cl·) and bromine radical (Br·) (source), and the first two are the only ones naturally occurring. Therefore, the ozone remaining from our first scenario would be reduced to zero by reactions like: $OH + O_3 → {HO}_2 + O_2$ or ${NO}_2 + O_3 → {NO}_3 + O_2$ Among others. The exact time that will take will depend on the elevation, as the abundance of ozone as well as the radicals can vary orders of magnitude trough the stratosphere. It will also depend on the exact spectrum of your "sustitute Sun", as some of those reactions are also mediated by light and might not happen in the absence of light of the right wavelength. I know this answer might be disappointing, as it seem that a model would need to be run to really say how long it would take to destroy all stratospheric ozone. But still I thought would be an informative answer after 11 month without one. I hope, it motivate a better answer or the improvement of this one. 

That kind of "moving clouds animation" is a very common one, as it is used routinely to aid in weather forecasting. However, it is not very common to see it in a whole-world geographic projection as the example you show, I'll elaborate later on why that's the case. Traditionally, a common source of "cloud animations", have been NOAA's geostationary GOES satellites, in operation since 1975, with 17 satellites launched so far and more to come. If you are looking for visually compelling animations, the latest GOES-16 satellite is capable of producing color images of the Earth's disk every 15 minutes at a resolution of 0.5 km per pixels (at the equator). They look like this: 

(image taken from TripAdvisor and submitted by user huys25) The reason we found meteorites up to about that size only, is because they are small enough to suffer a significant slow-down when falling though the atmosphere. Larger meteorites hit the surface so fast that the energy released vaporize the meteorite, so only the crater is left with no traces of the impacting body. 

As you have multiple nearby gauge stations. I would suggest to compute a multiple linear regression that would allow you to estimate the rain in one station using the data from the others. Then, compute the historical standard deviation of the measurements in that station relative to the prediction using the linear regression model. With this, you can filter data errors by rejecting all points that deviate more than X standard deviations from the prediction based on nearby stations. You have to define your threshold X based on experience, and by looking at the data. It will depend in the quality of the correlation between the precipitation in the different stations, so no universal value can be defined. 

The different gases that make up the air have different densities. So, naively, one would expect the heavier gasses to pool in the lower atmosphere and the light ones at the top. I asked myself this question a long time ago and I found the answer to be that the mixing produced by atmospheric circulation was more than enough to keep the whole mix homogeneous, and I was happy with that answer until I considered the case of caves, or chambers within the Earth that have been discovered in underground mines, and that have been isolated for millions of years. But despite of that, there is no reports of miners dying because on the top of the cavity the air was only nitrogen or oxygen at the bottom. Is the mixing produced by molecular movement due its temperature enough to avoid stratification? Or is there another reason? Would air at very low temperature suffer from density stratification? 

The graph looks correct, and after having a look at the NASA/USGS Radiance calculator, it seem that curves can't be annotated. However, below the plot there is a button to download the source data of the plot as a comma separated file (CSV), that you can open in Excel or any spreadsheet manager program and plot it with annotations and all the customization you want. For the wavelength of the peak in emission you don't have to look further than the box below the graph titled "Wavelength of Maximum Radiance", which for the Sun should say something like 0.52 micrometers as in the screenshot below: 

And the mean total insolation received by land is 6.45e14 kWh/day or 645 PWh/day (peta watts per day), in contrast with 1,656 PWh/day by oceans. Therefore 72% of the energy end up in the oceans. The total is 2,301 PWh/day, which as a sanity check, we can see that it have the same order of magnitude than the total amount of energy hitting the top of the atmosphere, a value that we can easily calculate using the solar constant and Earth's radius (24*1.362*pi*6378100^2 = 4.177e15 Wh/day= 4,177 PWh/day). These two totals don't match as expected because a significant fraction of the energy gets reflected (Earth's albedo is 0.3) or absorbed by the atmosphere. To wrap up all this information in the context of your question. There is indeed a great potential for offshore solar power, that maybe we will tap into in the future. However, the transport of the energy could be now the main constraint. Making offshore project viable only in areas of high real state prices, making too expensive to build them on land, and therefore making the offshore alternative a sensible one. In those cases the location is mostly dictated by the location of the demand more than the location with higher solar irradiation. If I let the imagination loose, maybe those large high-irradiation zones in the Pacific could one day host floating industrial complexes, producing and using the power on the spot for manufacturing or other industrial processes. 

There is a competing effect called "kinetic isotope fractionation", that that leads to a correlation with temperature in the opposite direction (because heavier isotopes have slower diffusion times and are slower crossing membranes), but in the case of Oxygen isotopes, its effects is overcome by equilibrium fractionation. 

But it only looks flat as long as you are seeing that circle from within the same plane where the circle is. If you are in the plane of the circle, it becomes indistinguishable from a flat rectangle or any other shape. However, if you are a significant distance above that circle, you will start seeing it as an actual circle. Then when taking this to the full 3D picture, you start realizing that the Earth is round. 

Given the lack of total radiative forcing data, we can instead make the comparison with some other variable. Such analysis will be liable to depend on the chosen variable as pointed out before. Therefore, to minimize that problem let's pick a variable with a large influence in the difference between the four scenarios. I think that would be $CO_2$ emissions from fossil fuels and industry. The the emissions predicted by each scenario can be obtained at the RCP Database (version 2.0). That data looks like this: 

As mentioned by Barry in the comments, you just have to substract 6 degrees of latitude to get the ring around areas were it never gets DARKER than civil twilight or darker for 24 or more hours (or 12° for nautical twilight and 18° for astronomical twilight). That would be: 

As you describe it. But that's very different than "subterranean biomass". In particular, the following sentence that you mention: 

(Originally from here) You can see that many processes move carbon around, but the main reservoir by far is the crust, and that reservoir is tiny compared with all the $\text{CO}_2$ stored deeper in the Earth's interior. Finally, in addition to be required by photosynthesis, $\text{CO}_2$ is part of the Earth's thermostat, that together with the silicate weathering have been key to keep the Earth's temperature in the range of liquid water. Arguably another very important need for the existence of life as we know it. 

For question 1), the exact number will vary depending on the elevation model you use for the calculation. High resolution elevation models are available for land, but for sea the resolution is much lower. The best global elevation model covering both land and seafloor is arguable ETOPO1, with a resolution of about 2 km. And if we mask all areas outside of the range -200 to 800 m it turns into this 

Ozone is indeed a greenhouse gas. But not due to its capacity to absorb/scatter UV radiation, but instead due to its capacity to absorb infrared radiation. In contrast with other greenhouse gases (Like $CO_2$ or Methane), the spectral absorption bands of Ozone are not confined to the infrared part of the spectrum, there are ozone absorption bands also the UV too. However, if ozone were capable to absorb only UV radiation, it would NOT be a greenhouse gas. Because the Earth's surface do not emit UV radiation. Therefore, the greenhouse gas properties of Ozone do not come from its ultraviolet absorption bands, but instead from its infrared absorption bands, that you can see in the following infrared spectrum obtained from NIST: 

(Figure from Wikipedia commons originally here) Scenarios versus measurements Nevertheless, we can attempt to plot the actual measurements against what was predicted by the scenarios. The best variable to contrast would arguably be the total radiative forcing. However, that is a quantity difficult to calculate and I haven't found published values like those in the IPCC Assesment report 5 (AR5) Annex II table AII.1.2, beyond 2011. Up to that year, the forcings were beautifully summarized in figure 8.18 of AR5 chapter 8: 

But due to the frequent cloud coverage your best bet are radar images. A great search portal is VERTEX from the Alaska Satellite Facility. I just made a search, and there is an image of today, but I liked more this one taken yesterday (January 31st 2018) by the satellite Sentinel-1A 

Putting all together, our upper limit for the chemosynthetic biomass would be: $\frac{0.016 MJ/m^2 year \times 1.2 \times 10^{12} m^2}{10 MJ/kg}=1.92 \times 10^9 kg/year$ Now, if we compare that with the 1.7$\times 10^{14} kg/year$ that is produced by photosynthetic primary producers. We get that chemosynthesis produce AT MOST a 0.001% of the biomass. It can be argued that chemosynthesis happens also outside of hydrothermal vents. But those other locations, like geysers and hot springs, are much smaller. Other more extensive chemosynthetic ecosystems have been proposed, like SLiMEs (Subsurface Lithoautotrophic Microbial Ecosystems), but even if they exist over extensive areas, their productivity would be very small. To summarize, it would be more correct to say that "More than 99.999% of the life on Earth gets its energy from the Sun". And given all the over estimations we made, I would not be surprised if a more detailed calculation would add a few extra "9's" to that figure.
