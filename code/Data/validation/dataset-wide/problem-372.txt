Human genetic material when transplanted into an eggcell becomes a human. At least according to us - humans are sentient. Thus, if we start with human genomes, we just need to modify them enough that they are unable to breed with normal humans. There are multiple ways to do this but one way would be to split one or more of our chromosomes into several smaller chromosomes. This would make the modified lifeforms basically identical to humans, but when a sperm and an egg meet they would not be able to match their chromosomes correctly and there would be no viable offspring with normal humans. Over time (hundreds of thousands of years), or with exrtra induced mutations or additional deliberate changes, the new species would diverge from normal humans. All of this is probably doable with current gene-editing technologies together with current cloning technology, at least if neither ethics nor budget is a problem. 

Self-sufficiency, the key to Anarchy The system you describe is a kind of Anarchy, and Anarchy comes with a lot of problems in an advanced society - that is why we see no successful Anarchies around. The main problem with Anarchy is that modern/advanced societies depend completely on: 

If it can convert mass to energy this makes all other energy absorption abilities redundant. Lets say a spear weighing 3 kg is converted into energy according to: 

I realize that you specifically ask about a gun that uses the "explosion" of annihilated antimatter to propel the bullet so this reply might not be what you want. But, doing it that way is not a good way to take advantage of the antimatter. Antimatter battery and a electromagnetic mass-driver Instead of using the annihilation of antimatter as an explosion (as it will not cause hot gasses, rather high energy radiation) it might be better to consider an advanced antimatter fuel-cell. Antimatter is held in some kind of containment and minuscule amounts are freed to annihilate. The tiny discharge of radiation is used by the fuel cell to charge electric capacitors. The capacitors are then in turn used to charge electromagnetic coils which accelerate a magnetized bullet towards the target at high speed. Benefits over a normal chemical gun is that only the bullets need to be stored (making ammo take less space - meaning one can have more of it). Also there is no discharge of hot/poisonous gasses which might be problematic in some environments. The antimatter fuel cell might never need a replacement due to it's energy density. For a really endless gun - replace the mass-driver with a laser, or go half way and let the magnetic coils accelerate super-heated ionized gas. 

On average, a woman dies after 5 pregnancies, resulting in on average 3,8 children. 2,53 of these survive childhood. 1,29 of them are girls. So each girl born gives rise to 1.29 new girls. Thus there is an increase in the female population with 1.29 each generation (~ 25 years) and one can assume that there is a similar amount of men as there are girls. 3000 years = 120 generations 1.29 ^ 120 = 18,653,710,652,522 girls per original girl.. So, well, 3000 years is a long time. If food is unlimited they can easily reach billions and above. What will happen is that food and living space runs out. If food really is endless overpopulation will spark massive epidemics killing lots of people and increasing the mortality rate dramatically. That is unless they develop advanced medicine during those 3000 years. On Sustainable Population: According to this, the carrying capacity of the land using various methods are as follows: 

Functionally, these last two are what eusocial insects do, and is basically the definition of eusocial. While this only occurs in insects (I believe), it wouldn't be unreasonable for a different species to develop a similar system, even if the balance of "breeders" and "workers" is different than, say, ants. 

Lakes are rivers are probably going to be mostly fine. Algae (despite being associated with the word "bloom") does not use pollen. Small creatures eat the algae, larger creatures eat those creatures. Ranching is pretty much done for. Without grasses, it's going to be far cheaper to ship in beef and wool/mutton from somewhere else. Chickens, on the other hand, will probably be the farm animal of choice. Continual food production (eggs) plus the occasional meat, and their diet is very adaptive. They can eat the scraps from the plants that humans won't eat (probably not potatoes; the plants are in the nightshade family), bugs, meat scraps, mice, etc.. Pigs might become a "status" animal. They take a lot of food before they're ready to eat, but the food they do eat can largely be scraps of what the humans are eating (or not even scraps). Ship in the seeds for most vegetables. Things like lettuce, cabbage, celery, carrots not only don't require going to seed, but are better if harvested before going to seed. This means you'll have to ship in 100% of your seeds (instead of letting some of your crop go to seed), but shipping in seed is a lot better than shipping in finished product (especially since finished product likes to rot). Ferns, moss, lichen, and fungus (mushrooms) are all plant/plant adjacent but do not flower or pollinate. Instead, they reproduce through spores. It might be nice to say, "And now we have a fern-based ecosystem," but remember that they all require substantial water and shade. Without a healthy forest system, they can't last long on their own, so take that into consideration. 

Seen here, the circle is the mage, and there are two nested six pointed stars. The best design would require some more design work and careful consideration of the angles (and, therefore, number of points), entry point size, and if projectiles that entered the first barrier could be redirected to exit again, instead of needing to be absolutely halted by the internal barrier. But this is a good place to start. 

The average temperature of Earth ocean's surface water is 17°C. The average temperature of Earth ground-level atmosphere is 14.6°C. These numbers are tightly correlated. This is why coastal areas usually have warmer winters and cooler summers than inland areas of the same latitude. The fact of the matter is, it's really difficult to change the ocean's temperature, and really easy to change the atmosphere's temperature. This means the ocean temperature constantly pulls at the air temperature until they're both roughly the same. There's no way to do this without magic or technology indistinguishable from magic. 

Animals see "visible" light via rods and cones, and humans have 3 different types of cones to see different wavelength ranges (i.e., colors) of light. Tetrachromacy is condition where an animal has four different types of cones. This fourth type of cone does not expand the visual spectrum, but can allow better discrimination of colors within it. So. @AndreiROM wonders why you couldn't fit all 3 sets in one pair of eyes, and the answer to that is simple: real estate. Eyes are packed full of as many rods and cones as can fit. While there's 3 (or 4) types of cones, they all sample a narrow, overlapping spectrum. If you wanted to pack two more wavelength ranges in, you'd have to cut your cell density for each spectrum to 1/3. Or, have different pairs of eyes. But, this creates significant problems. First and foremost, 3 independently functioning eye pairs means 3 independently functioning visual cortices in the brain. The visual cortex is a significant proportion of the brain, so replicating it a bunch is going to make things pretty screwy. Even with two eyes, our cortex has a tendency to cheat and only actually process one eye and only occasionally sample the other. So, we cheat. One visual cortex. Slightly expanded because some additional complexity is unavoidable. But, we only use one pair of eyes at a time. That way, the cortex won't get overloaded. Since we're on completely separate wavelength ranges, having all three overlap at once wouldn't be terribly useful anyway (it would be like looking at one of those 3D eye puzzles when you haven't seen it yet). Why would they overlap? One visual cortex; this is the price we pay for not being a bobble-head. This adds some interesting elements to the system. Under normal circumstances, one of these humanoids would only have one set of eyes open at a time, and the other two closed. This is because having unused eyes closed protects them, and it's also the simplest "off" switch. It also gives them the ability, in certain, very specific circumstances, to open multiple sets and overlay the information, if that does become advantageous. Imagine trying to code break a message that requires you to see in 3 wavelength ranges at once when you have just the one pair of eyes. But now we're back to... why do they need three sets of eyes to begin with? Visual wavelength ranges are certainly a possibility, but you'll need to find a dire biological reason for them to need eyes that can see in those wavelength ranges. Maybe there's areas of poison gas that can only be seen in ultraviolet. Maybe their prey can't be seen at night except infrared. Anything that can only be seen in a particular range and seeing it would vastly increase either survival or mating chance will exert evolutionary pressure on developing a system to see in that wavelength range. While they are predators, something to consider is that there are very few species that nothing kills, particularly since most species are willing to kill members of their own species. That means defensive abilities are still important. In this case, whatever the outside set of eyes, those are your "prey" eyes (the eyes that are most useful when something is hunting you). They have a much wider field of view, but much smaller binocular overlap, which means they're good at noticing things from more directions, but bad at focusing on them. There are alternatives, most notably spatial frequency, but either way would work if you apply the appropriate evolutionary pressures. 

Without a social order, with law-enforcement, taxes, leadership etc. there is no way to keep the division of labor and common infrastructure going. Thus the key to working Anarchy lies in abandoning both of those points and gaining self-sufficiency. Hunter-Gatherer society: One simple way of achieving that is to have a primitive society where every family or individual have their own hut, makes their own primitive tools and depends on no-one else. Slave owners: Another possibility is that these independent, non-governed individuals are actually not the entirety of society. Each person, or family, controls a large group of slaves/servants who provide them with all their needs. The slaves provide food, protection, maintains their homes and even provides skilled craftsmen like smiths and tailors. But how can we keep the benefits of an advanced society and still be self sufficient? Post-scarcity/Augmented individuals: For a modern/futuristic society to be self sustainable on an individual basis I think there is only one option. AI's, robots and other automatic systems allow each individual to gain what we currently gain from society. Robots can serve as protection and harvest raw materials and food. 3D-printers and replicators can create even advanced technological items. Structures are self-maintaining and contains their own energy source. If such a system of robotics would be in the hands of each individual or small group - then they would be self-sufficient. Such augmented people would avoid the drawbacks of anarchy. Taken the augmented individual solution one step further each individual have their own space-ship full of automated systems. Each ship is entirely self sustained, leaving its owner with no need for other people except companionship. 

That's about 75 TWh of energy, enough to power the entire current world for 6 hours. The kinetic energy of the spear and any such does not matter on this scale. If this being is in contact with any matter it will have access to endless energy. Releasing just a minuscule fraction of the energy of that spear as a pulse of pure heat or radiation will destroy any kind of opposition that would be on a spear-throwing-level of technology (or any other level for that matter). If it consumes a small hill it will have enough energy to toss the Earth out of the solar system.. Drop abilities that involves converting matter to energy. 

For travelling millions of years into the past: The Moon was closer in the far past. If you know your exact location and see the moon - a device which measure the distance to the moon would be able to calculate what time you are in (roughly). Measuring the distance to the moon can be done in many ways but one simple way is to simply measure its diameter in the sky (although since the orbit of the moon is not circular, you would have to measure for several nights in a row using just a visual measurement). Atmospheric composition have changed over geologic timescales. Measuring carbon dioxide, oxygen and trace elements and comparing with a detailed chart might give a hunch of where you are. 

Warfare is more and more moving away from having one big army in one spot where a big bomb would be effective. Urban warfare, guerrilla tactics, hidden bases, jamming, stealth technology - those things seem to be the keywords for modern wars. Combined with cyber-attacks, espionage, propaganda, misinformation and other types of information warfare, 'diplomacy'/bullying and economic pressure. That's why we see more development towards autonomous weapons and surveillance than weapons of mass destruction today. Most likely, as globalization continues we will see a shift from "military" characteristics towards "police" characteristics in future warfare. At least unless we trigger a full out world war III, in which case we are all doomed anyways.
