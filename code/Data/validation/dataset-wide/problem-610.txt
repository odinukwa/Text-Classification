In London there are some new 'Cycle Superhighways' painted in blue with lots of associated signage (and publicity), they're envisaged as arterial routes from the edges of the city into the centre. Obviously they're only useful if your journey is close to where they are but they have had some quite obvious effects even in the few months of their official existence. Pro: 

There are certainly techniques that will put unusual strains on the bike, track stands could be, I certainly think that excess use of a turbo trainer does. I (try) to do track stands where possible and my commute bike (~150k per week for a number of years) only died when I crashed it ... Quality of the ingredients is certainly one factor. Another could be the manufacturer (although you have already mitigated a little for that in your question). Many people, in particular those who come to cycling from other sports, might try to deploy their power in different ways. I used to row and when I was looking at a new bike, I spotted a lovely looking candidate, but the guy in the shop said "I won't sell you that, it's a Bianchi, and I find that all big rowers break Bianchis", his theory was that lugs like me (I'm only 6' and 200lb but that's big for a racing cyclist) tend to grind out in the bigger gears while the Bianchi tended to favour the lighter rider who'll spin it higher, but in a lower gear. So the chances are that it probably is something about how you ride, but that doesn't mean changing your style, just finding a bike designed around you. Or maybe you should change your style ... 

The most common measurement I've seen is c-c (centre to centre), the distance between the two horizontal tops of the drops, running parallel with the stem and behind the hoods. If that doesn't make sense, see the following image. 

Coordination: When riding in a group of singles, it can be hard to stay together on a hill climb, because everyone climbs at different paces. It depends on so many factors, weight, gear ratios, preferred cadence, getting out of the saddle when it feels comfortable and so on. Being forced to climb faster or even slower than you'd like to can upset a rider's rhythm. On a tandem it's more likely that your hill-climbing rhythm will be awkward. If the captain wants to stand up, the cadence becomes more "stompy", leaving the stoker feeling they're not able to put much power in. If the stoker stands, they can end up rubbing their face on the captain's back. If they both stand, then the tandem can be hard to control unless the captain is much heavier and stronger than the stoker. Power-to-weight ratio: A tandem with two light riders feels similar in pace to a single with a heavy rider. Most heavier riders are slower on climbs. Lack of aerodynamic advantage: The Coordination factor above is more than compensated for on the flat by a tandem's aerodynamic advantage: 195% power for perhaps 120% aerodynamic drag. However, air resistance is negligible on a climb. It may be that other sources of drag are not reduced so much. For example: 

In addition to watching, there are lots of things to read, for instance the great autobiographies like Laurent Fignon's We Were Young and Carefree ("Nous Ã©tions jeunes et insouciants"), Bobet's Tommorow We Ride and David Millar's Riding Through The Dark - all of these have large sections devoted to races, racing and reacting to events. The Rider by Tim Krabbe is fiction, but not really, giving wonderfully evocative descriptions of being a racing cyclist. There are also some good bloggers, e.g. In The Saddle and Rouleur Magazine (which has some great articles if you can find it in your locale). And then go to YouTube and search for Sunday in Hell. Probably the best movie ever made about cycling, not all about the strategies, but definitely a lot about how to race. 

You can only accurately compare cyclists on the same course in the same conditions. Even then you'll find that some cyclists will be faster on a hilly course while others are faster on a flat course. 

You should try a few out to assess their shifting performance. Even better if you can do a blind test. Also consider researching the cost of new parts (eg: chains) and the ease of maintenance. In my opinion weight is overrated and you can spend a lot of money to make a groupset 100g lighter. 

You could try leaving earlier, maybe before the day heats up. Granted that during the summer this means a very early start, but at certain times of the year it can mean pleasantly cool morning air and maybe less traffic. Look at the forecast and aim to wear clothing that makes you feel slightly too cold at the start of your journey, while carrying a few alternative layers in your panniers. It's worth taking into account wind direction when planning. On cooler days wear something windproof you can quickly unzip at the first sign of overheating. 

'Spinning' is the idea that the momentum of the legs is maintained through using a slightly higher gear than you might be able to push it with. So you'll be trying to maintain an almost constant rhythm, you don't push explicitly - or if you do, you're matching it with a pull on the other side. By constant I mean both rev to rev, but almost within the revolution, pushing harder (even on both sides) is going to be accelerating and slowing down within each stroke - maintenance of speed and momentum is generally easier than creation. Too much power is a slightly bizarre, but completely credible idea: if you're pedalling 80 or 100 revs per minute, or even slightly higher, you should be trying to keep each rev the same. Pushing significantly harder for a few revs (or parts of revs) won't make a massive speed difference, but will hurt you and possibly your bike! Straight away, a quick observation is that these styles will only really work if you're clipped in (or maybe with straps). 

As long as you've got your key with you - some of them stay in the lock when it's unlocked - it's easy. No more excuses! 

If you both arrived at the give-way line at the same moment, then given the above image, you might still have the priority (de jure), but it's not obvious and my instinct is to let the faster vehicle go first. As others have mentioned, us cyclists have to be careful as collisions are usually more serious for us. Whenever cars do show you consideration, always give them a wave or nod of thanks, even if you have priority. 

There's a definite brand loyalty card to play too - it emphasises both that the company could have some visibility out there in the real world but also that its employees are so happy and proud to work for them that they're prepared to advertise this to fellow road users. Be prepared to rebutt some possible negatives, though, amongst many non-cyclists cyclists, especially in urban areas, don't always have the best reputation for obeying all traffic laws all the time. Your employers or senior decision makers might not necessarily want to be associated with riders who jump red lights or buzz pedestrians on road crossings. Perhaps offer to have riders sign a good conduct promise for when they're wearing the shirt. Indeed, that could be a way of getting some local press (if it's a specifically local company) - highlighting being good citizens. 

Apart from the complexity already described, it's arguable that bikes are almost always going slower than cars, who seem to be the main following vehicle intended to notice brake lights. A car seeing a cyclist ahead will almost always need to slow down or overtake. If the cyclist is braking they just need to do so a little sooner. Coupled with being able to see when a cyclist is pedalling or not, this gives brake lights much less value on a bike. If rear light can go brighter without dazzling others, some cyclists would want to have it brighter all the time. (IIRC, this is the gist of a suggestion in a recent CTC Cycle magazine article). 

It really depends on what you're normally used to and what your aim for the century is. If a century is a big deal for you (that isn't meant to be patronising) I would think that your training schedule will have been slowly building up the miles over the previous few months, throwing in occasional shorter and sharper rides for a bit of variety (never underestimate the importance of speed work while building up your endurance). Your last longer ride will have been 60-70 miles a couple of weeks before, probably with 40-50 the previous weekend. Your body will adapt gradually to incremental additions and will keep hold of the new abilities for a while. Don't be afraid to do nothing in the week before if that's what you feel like, you won't lose all ability (even stopping your bike commute if you do that), but utterly resist the temptation to cram in any sessions you feel like you've missed. As others have said, it's too late to fix your training schedule now. In many sports there's a saying that a start to a race won't win it for you, but it can surely lose it for you if it's bad enough, and this goes as well for the week before a long event. My advice, especially if it's your first century, is to rest well, eat well, hydrate well. Try and do a short-ish ride (25-30 miles) a few days before, at the very least to make sure your bike is ok. And never, ever, do something new and untested to your equipment on race day: that includes new shoes, new shirt, new power bars, even new bar tape. You might get away with a new bottle, that's about it.
