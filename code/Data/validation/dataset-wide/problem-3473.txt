After the Chinese central bank removed the peg against USD, yuan appreciated but Chinese exports didn't seem to be affected. They are steadily increasing. How can this be explained ? 

Price acts as a signal in markets. In a perfectly competitive market all firms face a horizontal demand that is fixed by the market and hence they have no control over the price of their good. It is market determined and no single firm can influence it. However, in an monopolistic market where there are many brands they have some control over their prices. Each brand can have a differentiating feature and certain level of loyalty. Imagine a firm whose brand is very strong, it can certainly charge a higher price. In fact informed buyers in general will expect strong brands to charge a higher price than others. Others might be offering cheap goods so and they will have their own market share. Hence the price change here is like a signalling event which can give information to buyers whether the goods are of good quality or substandard etc. Now, imagine a monopoly. In a perfect monopoly price will give no information. There is a single firm which produces goods and it can decide any quantity and price suiting it cost structure. A monopoly charging very high price doesn't mean it will offer high quality goods. 

You are paid 15 dollars each by the elderly. You should count this as your revenue from providing the services of finding 100 domestic care to those elderly. Your are even finding those 100 elderly people. You can't say that you are not doing anything. Economic systems work on the basis of demand and supply. There is demand of domestic care but keeping in mind the supply, people are willing to provide their services for 10 dollars only. Your services could be rarer than theirs, so you earn more. Sometimes, it may appear that people are working a lot and are paid much lesser than those who don't work that hard. It is not important how much work you are doing or what work you are doing. What decides the price is the intersection of those beautiful demand and supply curves. It may not sound appealing but that is how it works. Anyways, economics is allegedly dismal. 

Then he introduces Recursive Utility (RU) as a class of preferences developed to overcome these issues. He then proceeds to study the properties of RU, without stopping to study these "shortcomings". I am interested in the following: even though I could try to derive the anomalies myself, is there a article/textbook/survey article that studies formally (by formally I mean in a decision theoretic fashion, i.e studying the axioms and their effect on the representation) the structure of TAEU and show formally the shortcomings mentioned above? The author offers references for textbook and survey treatments of RU, but not the TAEU. Thank you very much for any comment and help! 

My question is about the following notation: I have noticed in several places (for example here (page 15) and here (page 1)) that different authors use different notations for choice correspondences. Given a set $X$ of objects that might be chosen and a collection of non-empty subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of the power set of $X$, some use 

I think that this article might be helpful: “Exotic Preferences for Macroeconomists” $URL$ They give a thorough explanation of many preference functionals and show their usefulness with macroeconomic applications. Im not a specialist in macroeconomics, so I dont know the literature that well, but I think that the most used preferences nowadays are the Epstein-Zin preferences. The article I cite discusses thoroughly their properties. A nice thing this paper has is that it contains detailed comments from Peter Lars Hansen and Ivan Werning among others at the back. Hope it helps! 

The typical dynamic consumption-saving under certainty model can be written as: $$ \max V(c)=\sum_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{t-1}\; u(c_t) $$ Subject to the intertemporal budget constraint $$ \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{y_t}{1+r}=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{c_t}{1+r} $$ Where $T\leq \infty$ (finite or infinite horizon), $\beta \in (0,1)$ is the subjective discount factor, $y_t$ is the individual's income and $c_t$ is the individual's consumption in every time period. Finally, $u(\cdot)$ is the agent's subutility function, with $u^{\prime}>0$ whose concavity is usually related to the agent's preference for consumption smoothing. The argument is equivalent to the one justifying that an individual will reveal risk aversion iff his utility function over wealth is strictly concave. The argument that leads to consumption smoothing is the following: The first order condition for the problem is the well known Euler equation $$ \frac{u^{\prime}(c_t)}{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}=\beta \; (1+r) $$ It is assumed that $\beta^{-1}=(1+r)$ so that $$ u^{\prime}(c_t)=u^{\prime}(c_{t+1}) \quad \Rightarrow \text{by strict concavity of} \; u \quad c_t=c_{t+1} $$ I have two questions regarding this argument which are somehow related: 

I would strongly recommend you to read Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew Mcafee et al for some serious and real insights about this topic. The world economic forum this year had the same theme. In my view (which are heavily derived from the works of the above mentioned dignitaries) the problems arising from complete automation will be the lowering or stagnation of income levels. As Erik mentions in his Ted talk, productivity levels are at all time high but income levels are not. This was not the case in previous technological revolutions. People and systems adapted to new technologies and income rose along with productivity. Now they don't share the same relationship. One of the reasons is that we are not changing our systems well to absorb the technology. For example, if people are saving a lot of time because of automation, they should be able to spend it in something constructive. May be entrepreneurship, maybe knowledge work. To make all those automation work, people are required to program, design, develop and create. There needs to be a shift from typical work to knowledge work. If such a shift is not there and that too at a speed that matches with the speed of technological changes then income levels will continue to fall, unemployment will rise. In Andrew Mcafee's words, "we need to RACE WITH THE MACHINE". 

Your assertion is in line with 'rational expectations theory'. It says that economic agents will take all available information including the possible policy actions into account and then make decisions and these decisions will affect the future. In contrast to other theories this means that public policy will not be able to affect private decisions (policy ineffectiveness proposition). Rational expectations will counter the effect of public policy. What is mentioned in the paper is quite different from this. Typically, it is assumed that market is information sensitive to public policy. 

Jamzy has a good answer to which I would add that other alternative indicators have also their limits and measurement challenges. Especially if you want to compare between countries, GDP figures may be the only available. They have been recorded for a long time also so you can look at the evolution. The idea of alternatives indicator has not taken much traction because no other indicator is readily available. 

Scarce resource : is a (physical) limitation which forces us to make choices accordingly. It is what is available under current technology and cost of extaction. We could say its a supply side perspective and generally refers to material. Unilimited desires: Is a demand side perspective. Individuals or organizations usually want more tomorrow than today. Even if you get satiated of one good you will want more. For instance if you have enough foood you can't eat more but maybe you would wish a special meal in a fancy restaurant. So even if cooking home was sufficient to narch your need, after an increase of income you will buy more services... bigger house... There are diminishing returns to consume more of the same good but imagination makes it possible to always find a new object of desire. Thus unlimited wants. By combining these two phenomenons, a scarcity situation arises and humanity must make choices hopefully to fullfill the most pressing needs. 

If you were to read only introductory book in econonomics: Economics: The User's Guide by Ha-Joon Chang. It explains all basics concepts in economics, and the differences between the main school of thoughts. It is quite easy to read, it is not a textbook. For an overview of financial markets: Capital Ideas, and Capital Ideas Evolving by Peter L. Bernstein For your interest in electricity: The Grid: A Journey Through the Heart of Our Electrified World by Phillip F. Schewe, very interesting on how the grid came to be. Smart Grid: Integrating Renewable, Distributed & Efficient Energy by Fereidoon P. Sioshansi (Editor), Sioshansi is a reference in Smart Grid and the paradigm change from consumer to prosumer. Renewable Economics: How to compare the costs of different technologies: Energy Technologies and Economics 

It depends on what cost function the monopoly is facing. If the marginal cost function is not changing then there would be no change in pricing or quantity. 

Services will be calculated at the final price they are given in market. That price includes all value added items in providing the service. So, to calculate contribution of airlines in GDP, you just need to sum up the total value of tickets that are sold. Other things will automatically be counted in that. 

Commercial banks do a lot of lending and borrowing among each other and that is a sign of healthy flow of money in economy. This is because inter-bank activities ensure that enough credit is available and banks are engaging in lending to businesses, individuals etc. However, sometimes such lending is not what the central bank thinks it should be. Commercial banks may be cautious in lending to public or even to each other. This can happen when there are not enough investment opportunities according to them or because of low market sentiments. Banks at such times play safe and would rather park their money in their central bank accounts in the form of excess reserves. In such situations, when central bank reduces its rates there is less incentive for banks to park their money with it as their could be some other opportunities which could be more profitable. Secondly, the banks would have cheaper credit which can be used to finance their assets, to give loans and in case they face shortage of cash, central bank window is there to help them. Thus, reduction of rates by central bank can have many transmission mechanisms. However, there is absolutely no guarantee that such transmissions will happen. This depends on how the commercial banks receive this. How market reacts to this. Transmissions may take months or even years to complete. Within this period, the economy itself might grow or slow down and hence, the actual effect of these rate cuts or hikes could be just opposite to what the central bank intended. Hence, it's a tricky, inexact science and central banks have to work in a lot of uncertainty. 

Would still hold for a strictly convex utility function, as one needs a much general condition to the implication to hold, namely that the derivatives of the utility function will be unique for any increasing utility function.. it seems to be that the uniqueness of $u^{\prime}$ (i.e $u^{\prime}(a)=u^{\prime}(b) \quad \Rightarrow a=b$) will hold irrespective of the sign of $u^{\prime \prime}$ provided it is not equal to zero. If my thinking is correct this would imply that the desire for smoothing doesn't play any role on what the individual does at the end, as this possibility is open only when $\beta =(1+r)$ holds, and furthermore, it would be optimal to smooth out consumption even to an agent with a strictly convex utility function. 

Your question seems a bit broad. What kind of “theoretical economics” are your reading? Nevertheless, I infer from what you write that you need to start from the beginning with maths for economcis (and maths in general), (this is because of your comment not knowing when to use an exponent and when to multiply. Having said this, I would recommend: “Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis” by Hammond et al This book starts at the basics and builds up mathematical tools to study economic ideas. Having mastered this book, I would try “The Structure of Economics” of Eugene Silberberg. This books is more advanced, but it is “economics with mathematics”, so having aquired the basic mathematical tools in the first book, this book focuses con economic models from a mathematical standpoint. 

More precisely if $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell} : x \geq 0\}$, the production function would be $$ f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n}, \quad n\geq 2 $$ For simplicity we can assume the firm operates in a competitive market so that the price is given. My question is, how does the firm choose the input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}$ as to maximize profits? I did some research and apparently the type of problem this is a “multi-objective” optimization problem, and it appears to be an active field in engineering. Some of the methods to solve this kind of problems use pareto-dominance style arguments. I wanted to know if anyone could clarify the specific question of multi product profit maximization, and more generally I would also appreciate any literature or books on this topic (multi objective optimization), written for economists, as I have been searching in google and every book I find appears to be written for engineers. I suspect that a treatment of this topic from an economics point of view would involve some discussion of social choice theory. Any help is most welcomed! 

No one knows. It is very easy to explain crises in hindsight but to predict one is almost unpredictable. It is a very bold statement that I am making but it is true. It is almost impossible to predict and prevent crises. The system is not designed to do that. Economists try to design the system in such a way that it can tolerate crises not to prevent them. Former secretary Timothy Geithner mentions in an online lecture that the economic system is like a highway. You can put a speed limit of 10 miles per hour then there would be no accidents but then it won't serve the purpose of its existence at all. You have to make the trade-off. Nevertheless, the safeguards that are put in place after the Global Financial Crisis are more stringent across the world. 

Recently I conducted a small game among students of our institute. The game was based on Keynes' beauty contest game. The participants had to guess a number between 0 to 100 and the participant whose guess was closest to 2/3rd of the average of all guesses would win the game. The twist was this: We also awarded money to the winner in each round. The money was a multiple say, 5x of the final number (2/3rd of the average). What will be the Nash Equilibrium of this modified game. The solution to the original problem is of course everybody choosing 0. Will the equilibrium shift in the above described game. Consider n to be greater than 30. Any help would be appreciated. 

There is a sense of differentiation thus this is not competitive market clearly. Government regulations in an industry cannot be regarded as a monopoly as government mostly will decide on a price ceiling or floor and not the quantity of transport supplied. Since there are only 4 firms this is an oligopoly clearly. They can collude to restrict output and raise prices if it is within the limits set by government. Maybe the government has set the price to actually prevent collusion.
