Looking at the Argon 18 website it is almost certainly a triathlon bike. The other E series bikes are listed in the triathlon/time trial section, and their track bikes use a different naming scheme. The reviews I found also call it a triathlon bike. Then there are the brakes and derailers (and triathlon bars) mentioned by @ojs. Given the difference between track and triathlon riding and the rather obvious differences between bikes meant for each discipline (derailers vs. no derailers for starters) it seems quite odd that the seller can't tell you what type of bike it is. I'd second @RoboKaren's suggestion that you check it out as a possible stolen bike. 

It sounds like your derailer(s), or derailleurs if you prefer, are out of adjustment. Derailers work by guiding the chain from side-to-side to shift gears. They have limit screws that are supposed to stop the movement before the chain comes off, but if the limit screws are misadjusted it will be possible to shift beyond the limits of the chainrings in the front and/or the cogs in the back. From what you've said it sounds like you can get things back on track (so to speak) by shifting both derailers towards the middle of their range, then put the chain back on – any cog and ring that seem close – and pedal (have somebody hold the rear wheel up when you do this). The chain should settle onto the proper gear. You may hear some noise from the chain as it runs against on or both of the derailers (and may bounce around between gears if you get it just wrong). You should be able to make the front and maybe the rear quite down by making small adjustments. In any case, as long as you are towards the middle, the chain should stay on. If you find the chain coming off as you shift towards the extremes you'll need to adjust the derailers. Start with the limit screws. Parks has a articles on adjusting the front and rear as does Sheldon Brown. One thing to keep in mind is that rear detailers are also sensitive to the alignment of its hanger. 

There are also flat pedal specific cycling shoes, such as Five Ten (shown in the image). These are shoes with a special sticky rubber compound which offers better grip on platform pedals. I have not personally tried the model below, but flat pedal cycling shoes are generally more flexible than clipless cycling shoes, since they don't need to be stiff because the pedal already is. This means that they are similar to a normal shoe when walking, while still providing cycling specific benefits such as ankle protection and grippy sole compounds. These can be a worthy alternative if you want to use flat pedals and still have a pair of cycling shoes that are easy to walk in. 

The short answer is no. Cheap suspension forks do only add weight and complexity as you say, and give very little actual suspension. My personal experience with cheap forks for adult bikes are that they can take away some road chatter, but with the increased weight and complexity it is hardly worth it. The only worthwhile reason to have it must be that the kid likes the look and wants to ride the bike more because a suspension fork looks cool. 

material compatible with your brakes (resin/sintered) they fit properly (no extra wiggling, test by pulling the brake lever on then trying to roll the bike forward and backward. If there's slop in the brakes you may well have problems. they lock in place using the proper fasteners. I've heard of people using cable ties to hold "wrong" pads in place. That kinda works in an emergency. Be very careful. 

To the best of my knowledge there are no suitable direct-drive hubs available commercially, which means that there are no bikes sold that use them. Schlumpf make a unicycle direct drive hub that offers 1:1 and 1:1.55 gears, but for a recumbent bike those ratios would be ridiculously low. Also, it's obviously fixed gear so without a freewheel it would be even less useful on a bike. You may be able to convert a standard hub gear to direct drive, using a larger axle and feeding the drive through the centre. Hubs are designed to have drive from one side, and pedalling torque is quote large so this would probably involve a major redesign of the hub (I suspect this is why so few people have built them). Another problem is that hub gears are designed to have 2:1 or more gearing up from the chain drive before the hub. So once you got it working, you'd have lower gears than you expect. Using short cranks is a partial solution to that at best, but it's the only thing I can think of that might help. Greenspeed suggest that 100mm cranks are quite usable with only a slight loss of power (but higher rpm = lower gearing needed) 

Does the padding inside of a bicycle helmet contribute to the overall security of the helmet? I.e. do they cushion a crash in some way, or are they just there for comfort? 

Flat pedal specific shoes usually have a special rubber compound, such as Five Ten's sticky rubber or Shimano (and others) Vibram sole (used in hiking shoes as well). The goal of these special rubber compounds is to better stick to the pins of the pedals and are therefore usually softer so as to get a good grip on them. My personal experience with skate shoes is that their soles are harder and meant for gripping skate boards (hence the name) and thus focus on gripping a flat surface, instead of a set of pins. They also get dangerously slippery when wet for some reason. Flat pedal specific shoes may also have other bike-specific features such as crank arm ankle protection and stiffer soles. 

I bought a pair of bicycle pedals that to my surprise had no notches on the pedal spindle to use when tightening them. I managed to screw them in by hand, but they are not quite tight since I can't use a spanner on them. So what would be the correct way to tighten them? Are there any special tools or similar that I'm supposed to use? The offending pedals can be seen below. The spindle is, as you can see, completely smooth. 

The simple solution will probably be a longer bottom bracket. Square taper BB's come in a variety of lengths specifically for this reason. Switching to hollowtech might work, but if your frame isn't built to that spec you could well have the same interference problems... only now you have new hollowtech BB and cranks. This is one of those times it can be worth paying a bike shop. Not for the skill of the mechanic, but for the shelf of parts. They can try different sized BB's until they find one that fits, and all it costs you is labour and a single BB. Doing it at home you could end up with 3 or 4 BB's that are not quite right. 

It's definitely possible to do #1, although you need to match the bolt pattern and bolt circle diameter (BCD). That's a common change for many cyclists. If you're running both chains on the right hand side standard cranksets are all you need (this is typically why people do that) Chainline is important, and typically you would put both idler chainrings on the same side of the spider and no more is necessary. A different length bottom bracket for the captain or stoker could be used to fine tune that if necessary, but almost all tandems are built with the right hand edge of the BB shell in the same plane. Different size chainrings would work, and while it might be unusual at first I expect you would get used to it. However, cornering will be tricky as you may not be able to get both inside pedals in a high position, meaning either pedal strike or slow cornering. One way to avoid that would be a freewheel between the two riders, normally done via an intermediate drive (three chains!) 

I have a 2013 Shimano XT rear derailleur. It is part of a 2x10 drivetrain. How can I find out if it is a medium or a long cage one? The picture below shows the derailleur. 

It seems to me that a lot of full face bicycle helmets do not conform to the requirements of the ASTM F1952 standard for downhill bicycle helmets. Some noteable examples from the best selling list of chainreactioncycles.com are the Bell Super 2R, 661 Comp, and the Urge Drift. All of these appear to be popular downhill helmets that do not conform to ASTM F1952. Why is it so that many full face helmets do not conform to this standard? 

I have a Shimano BR-M445 disc brake caliper that has decided to give up on life, so I need a replacement. It seems like the BR-M445 is no longer produced, so are there other calipers that can replace it? 

And from purely personal anecdotal experience: I have a friend that doesn't like spoke protectors and has been pretty vocal about it. Faith would have it that a maladjusted XTR derailleur wrecked his wheel and destroyed itself. A spoke protector would have prevented just that. 

They don't mention the feature in the manual for that light, but my light definitely has it. And some of their new lights have a lit up ring around the button on the back, so it's likely to be present. The other solution is more common: have multiple rear lights. Many people use two (I use a battery powered flashing light as well as the constant, dyno light) 

I think you have the right idea - build up slowly. I've seen a few people with little kids out cycle touring, and did a couple of weeks with a group that included a mother and pre-walking infant. The people below apparently managed at least 1000km based on Moz's comments. 

If they work, use them. When I've been unable to find the right pads while touring I managed to find some that would go into the calipers and initially I planned to just ride to the next bike shop. But they worked as well as the originals so I kept them until they wore out. The key factors: 

The good news is that you're willing to compromise on price. That means a fairly light, fast bike that is comfortable and can carry loads is very doable. If you prefer an upright you could buy a titanium-framed touring bike and build it with decent components, probably ending up under 10kg for the complete bike (without panniers). A better solution IMO would be a recumbent, also a touring bike, but with suspension and a much more comfortable seat. "more than 40 miles" is easy on most recembents, so you can shop through the faster ones looking for a match between fit and load capacity. I would be looking at something like the M5 Shockproof 559, or HP Velotechnic Streetmachine, or Bachetta Giro 26. Recumbents will be heavier, but much more comfortable and faster (except uphill). You can spec those up to a considerable degree from the base machine, because the bikes are built to order. 

Alcohol and brake cleaner seems to be the recommended options for cleaning disc brake rotors. I don't have any of that available currently, so are there any suiltable alternatives to them that can be used safely? 

I am currently storing my bike in a repair stand where it hangs by the seatpost. I was wondering if this might not be ideal and that the prolonged hanging might put too much stress on the bike and that I should instead store it standing on the floor. Does this way of storing the bike pose any chance of damaging the bike compared to storing it standing? 

One of the pistons popped out of the caliper on my Avid Elixir 5 brakes. Can I just put the piston back in and bleed the brakes and then they will be good as new, or do I have to rebuild the whole caliper? 

Seems like the BR-M445 and BR-M446 are the same/interchangeable, while the BR-M447 uses some different parts, but still has the same hose, so I assume that it is compatible as well. 

Using (or switching back to) flat pedals may also be an option. Then you have the freedom to move your foot about while you are cycling, and this may alleviate the comfort problems you are having. And you will not have to worry about unclipping when stopping. I take it that you are a commuter or recreational rider who have been convinced to try clipless pedals, but if you do not feel that you gain any advantage from them for your type of riding, you should not hesitate to switch back to a pedal interface that you feel more comfortable with.
