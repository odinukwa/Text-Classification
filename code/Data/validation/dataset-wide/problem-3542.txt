Through automatic stabilizers, and due to acquisition of bankrupt banks and companies, absorbing the losses in the public budget. 

Comparing these factors to other large cities in Europe, it will be hard to match it. In Germany, Munich or Berlin could be more attractive for investors than Frankfurt. Paris would be the favorite in France, but regulation doesn't attract investors nor entrepreneurs - so Amsterdam or Luxemburg would be much more inviting in this regard. 

This means that if a country would have most of its population living out of subsistence farming, which in practice could be registered as zero income, this would lead to an estimated/assumed GNIpc equivalent to \$100 per year per capita, which no country would ever go below. Having this value makes sense when reading the starting notes of that section: 

The 40-week comes started with the movement of the 8h working day. The wikipedia article makes a quick summary of the historical progress of thinking from 12h work days in Britain during the industrial revolution to the nowadays 8h/day. The quick summary is that after the first world war, the International Labour Organization (ILO) was formed and its first convention was defining limits for the work day: 

Several users in this forum have addressed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as ponzi schemes. Bitcoins have several uses which could legitimate its value as a currency, but also have received massive investments in the last months, making it considered a highly speculative asset. Are there signs and information that proves that cryptocurrencies are being used as a (intentionally fraudulent) scheme, or should we consider it a speculative asset similar to other assets in economic bubbles that happened before? 

DSK is an ordinary guy... Especially in theoretical economics, there are lots of very good french economists like Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Farhi, Xavier Gabaix, Phillipe Aghion, François Bourguignon, Roger Guesnerie, Daniel Cohen, Pierre Cahuc, Antoine d'Autume and the list goes on. 

Some papers that come to my mind are ; -Calvo and Obstfeld (1988, Econometrica) -Endres et al (2014, Resource and Energy Economics) -Traeger et al. (2012, European Economic Review) In these papers, the objective function has two integrals but as these models are treating an overlapping generations model, there is a such aggregation that one of the integrals disappears because it is not possible to have an integral on an Hamiltonian. Otherwise, it is not possible to solve it by standard methods. I am not sure about but this so take it with precaution, this kind of problem with two integrals on the objective function could not be solved by optimal control techniques but by calculus of variation. There is a very good section about constraints with integrals on textbooks of -Kamien and Schwarz (Dynamic Optimization : The Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control in Economics and Management) -A. Seierstad and K. Sydsæter (Optimal Control Theory with Economic Applications) 

Why are you doing $\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial w'^2}$ ? Even if it is said that $w^{'}=w$ at the optimum, it should be taken different when you differentiate it for first order conditions. So, you differentiate it according to $w^{'}$ and $w$. 

There exists also a tendancy to treat growth models with heterogeneous agents. I think the question is not to use the right growth model but contribute to the theory by trying to change "representative agent" framework. That's why there exists so many growth models with heterogeneous agents in recent years. I don't think at all that endogenous growth models are better than Solow-Swan exogenous growth models. Using one of these models depends on what you are trying to show as an economic mechanism. For example, if you are interested by some economic questions as "how it could be possible to maintain a growth path in a developping country ?", sure that it will be more appropriate to use an endogenous model. 

Mark Zuckerberg is the founder of Facebook, and founders of companies own it via owning shares of that company itself. During an IPO, several shares of a company are sold, and a part of the total shares remains in possession of the founders (such as Zuckerberg). This makes it easier to value the shares that are owned by the founders, as the shares are valued publicly in the stock exchange. When you see he is "valued in billions" this means that he owns Facebook shares which, if sold at current prices, would be worth billions. In addition, Zuckerberg or founders can earn from his shares in two ways: 

Their approach to distributing the money is to keep the inflation low, which according to them and the US Congress, is on the best interest of the whole country and not just the banks. 

Just to add to Alecos excellent answer: besides production and consumption, the government takes the role of investor too, providing the capital to execute projects like building a military base. 

If you want to look at other providers, most of the surveys I've seen recently used Qualtrics, Typeform, SurveyMonkey or GoogleDocs. 

Source: Financial Times This supply chain is unlikely to become more centralised or placed offshore, for political and economic reasons. 

Short answer Airbus is a particular case of decentralised supply chain which came from historical and political reasons. Airbus is a consortium with several European states having a stake on it, which means that each state wants a part of the production in their country. Long answer: Why is Airbus' supply chain disperse The aviation industry for commercial planes basically has has two large players nowadays: Boeing and Airbus. The 70's-80's saw the consolidation of American producers, with Boeing as the survivor and most successful of them (incorporating other large players such as the old McDonell Douglas). Europe had smaller producers, such as BAC or Aerospatiale. Smaller European producers in the 70's and 80's wanted to compete with Boeing, namely with the success of the 727, but the fragmented market would be a challenge. Therefore, Airbus was a consortium created with several European manufacturers to have a large aviation player with European roots. To minimize political difficulties, the supply chain was split over several countries: 

If you intend to work on economic history, it could be not very useful but let's say, if you will work on macroeconomics, growth theory, you should have a good enough knowledge for optimal control theory, which could be considered as a branch of calculus of variation. Also, probability and statistics are very useful courses if you intend to work on uncertainty, finance or macroeconomics or stochastic calculus. As a nutshell, all these are tools that economists use for doing formal economics. There are some advices of Thomas Sargent on this topic that could be relevant for you. Here is the link ; $URL$ 

I think I proved in a rigorous way that the system is autonomous for the model that I have written 3-4 days and I think it is useful for the community, especially for those who are working on macroeconomics of growth. Let's write the present-value Hamiltonian ; $$\mathcal{H}=e^{-\triangle}\left[ U\left( c\right)\right] +\lambda _{2}^{}\left[ f(k)-c\right] +\lambda _{2}\left[ \rho +h(k)\right] $$ We know that ; $$\dot{\lambda}_{1}=- \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial k}$$ $$\dot{\lambda}_{2}=- \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \triangle}$$ When I differenciate Hamiltonian according to time $t$ ; $$\frac{d \mathcal{H}}{dt}=\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial t} + \mathcal{H}_k \dot{k} + \mathcal{H}_{\lambda_1} \dot{\lambda}_{1} + \mathcal{H}_\triangle \dot{\triangle} + \mathcal{H}_{\lambda_2} \dot{\lambda}_{2} $$ It is straightforward to see that this term reduces to the following one ; $$\frac{d \mathcal{H}}{dt}=\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial t}$$ From page 299, theorem 9.6.1 of Léonard and Dockner (Optimal Control Theory and Static Optimization in Economics) about the transversality condition which shows that $$\underset{t\rightarrow\infty}{lim}\mathcal{H}\left(t\right)=0$$ when $\rho > 0$ In this case, it is obvious that along the optimal path, the Hamiltonian takes the value 0, which ensures a autonomous dynamical system. 

Yes, you are correct: add the 25k both in cash and in liabilities. The balance sheet represents what you have (assets) and what you owe (liabilities). So when you get the loan you do have 25,000 in cash under assets, but you also owe it and will need to repay it at some point (which appear as 25,000 in bank loans, under liabilities). As you repay it, the value in liabilities decreases. If you need to learn more there are several free online courses, like this one. 

The question touches several points, but I can try to explain the "where did the money go in the crisis" with an example from Portugal: 

Insurance providers in high-risk areas tend to increase the premiums, particularly for re-insurance (Froot, 2001). Some insurers will also leave the market, with others coming in (Grace, Klein & Liu 2005) Semi-related: One paper with a 1970-2002 analysis of disasters and financial flows suggests that in poorer countries the migrant's remittances increase after the hurricanes covering $\frac 45$ of the damages, but in richer countries it only stimulates lending, not fully offsetting the losses (Yang 2008). 

If the price lowers, the firm will reduce its quantity supplied. That's it. The specific quantity depends on the variable and fixed costs. It's not mentioned that the company has to break even - think of a monopolist for example. 

Australia is now conducting a survey on same sex marriage, to decide if they take the vote to the parliament or not. Although it is called a survey, the population is treating it as a referendum. The government could decide on its own to legalize the same-sex marriage, the same way it decides on topics such as immigration laws. Are there any economic arguments that help a government to decide which topics are polled from the population and which are not? 

Your question is not that clear. So let me elaborate an answer on what I have understood from your question. Note that for the Solow model, when technological change increases, it is the "per capita" capital which decreases. This one is normal because you should give much more capital to your workers, as they are more productive (here the technical progress increases the productivity of workers.) I don't understand in which context $\frac{K}{AL}$ increases supply of innovations. What spurs innovation in Schumpeterian type growth models is the labor allocation in R&D (or spendings in R&D). This increases the creative destruction rate in the economy. For example, in this case, a decrease in labor $L$ can be consiidered as an increase in labor allocation in R&D. Or another possible interpretation that I can make is the following one. There exists a stock effect in Schumpeterian models. This means that if your knowledge stock $A$ is high enough, it would be difficult to make new innovations. (See Acemoglu 2009, chapter 14) So, in this case a higher $\frac{K}{AL}$ implies more innovation. 

The basic idea of Easterlin hypothesis is that 10 units of additional income does not require 10 units of additional happiness. The idea is close to the decreasing marginal utility of consumption. Also, commiting suicides are less in countries where there are so many conflicts. Commiting suicide is more often in countries where prosperity level is higher. 

It made me think about Lewis Model. In this model, the main idea is that if the agricultural sector is highly productive, there will be a transition of labor from agricultural sector to industrial sector, which will probably produce more value added products. With maintaining at least the same quantity of subsistance good, the industrial sector will develop. $URL$ 

When you look at case number 1, the Fed lends money to the bank, the bank can ask more than the assets it owns (e.g. asking for 2M when all the cash and bank assets are worth 1M). This means that the debt of the bank is accounted for and will be paid back with interest - but it is not backed. If the bank doesn't pay, even seizing all the bank's assets wont pay the debt back. 

Answering to the who: the GDP is usually calculated by a statistics agency of the government. In the US it is the America’s Bureau of Economic Analysis; in Britain, it is the Office for National Statistics. About how it is done in practice, take a look at this question: $URL$ 

The dotted line is just to help you read the scale and compare the isoquantas at each production level. It touches all the isoquantas at the point where you have equal inputs of labour and capital. The rest of the explanation is on the figure itself - it's just an example of increasing / constant / decreasing returns to scale. 

Several countries have it defined in their tax code, or by the national statistics institute, or the central bank. Stock exchhanges also define industry categories. For general purposes or international comparisons you can use the categories defined by the world bank (see also in word version), or from the United Nations. 

The best measure depends on what specifically do you want to measure. If you want to measure the asymmetry per se, then you can focus on alternative indicators and descriptive statistics, as you suggested. 

Applied Intertemporal Optimization by Klaus Wälde is a very very nice book, even for those who are not really familiar with mathematics. The book treats deterministic and stochastic models, both in discrete and continuous time. I would really say for this book "Dynamic Optimization for dummies". I was not familiar at all with dynamic optimization but this book let me to get through. 

Indeed, there is branch of literature about semi-endogenous models (Jones, 1995, Segerstrom 1999 etc.). They were basically arguing that there was a scale effect in endogenous growth models, which means that when population increases, by default, growth increases (it is due to the fact that there would be more researcher in society, this is the scale effect.) and this branch of literature shows that growth rate at the long run is equal to the growth rate of population, which is an exogenous term. It is why they called it as "semi-endogenous". This was challenging endogenous models but the empirical literature states that that the semi-endogenous model does not fit to data. Some empirical references are : Ha and Howitt (2007) $URL$ and Madsen (2008) $URL$ 

In fact, saddle path equilibrium is one of the most common equilibrium in canonical growth models, mainly in dynamic optimization problems. It is possible that he makes a reference to a decentralized equilibrium without cycles around steady state. Otherwise, if there are cycles around a steady-state equilibrium. It means that there are oscillations (see indeterminacy and bifurcation issues for technical details), which means that your equilibrium is not a saddle path. (I skip the mathematical details for those technical terms, which is beyond the scoop of your question.) In which situation, you don't have a saddle path equilibrium and some cycles around steady state ? A decentralized market economy with externalities which are not taken into account by agents in the market can show indeterminate equilibrium. I think he makes reference to this kind of economy. A very good and illustrative paper to respond to your question is Benhabib and Farmer (1994) I quote one of their sentences from introduction. Then, you can look at references cited ; "...Previous work on indeterminate equilibria has shown that stable steady states are associated with rational expectations models in which there exists a continuum of self-fulfilling belief-driven equilibria each of which is stationnary..." Hope it answers to your question.
