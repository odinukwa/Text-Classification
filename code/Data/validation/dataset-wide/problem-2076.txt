And to answer the question directly: At least in my office, no, it is not considered rude to issue an initial meeting invitation through the scheduling application. However, there are often good reasons to send a preliminary email (detailed above). 

Yes. As some comments pointed out, you only want to bring up another person's actions for discussion if they are affecting you. But when your team lead completes a task you have started, it is affecting you. Specifically, it's reducing your productivity by retroactively making the work you began redundant. This reduces your team's overall velocity. Your manager should want to hear about anything reducing the team's velocity. I think it is fair for you to be demoralized by this situation, but you will be better served by voicing this as a problem/opportunity that affects the team, rather than you as an individual. A word of warning: One thing you should be aware of is the risk that your team lead is not working overtime only because he enjoys it, but that he is working overtime to cover for a deficiency (real or perceived) in your output or quality. Hopefully, you can test for this by approaching your team lead the next time he has taken some work that you started. Just ask him, from a point of genuine concern, if he felt your progress was holding things up. Another piece of advice: If your team doesn't have some sort of work tracking software, get some. There's no reason not to be tracking the state and status of your deliverables. Part of that state is, who is planning/assigned to work on something, and if they've started it yet. We use Jira, but there are a bazzilion options. Tracking software will make it more difficult to accidentally take over a task another team member has started. 

Three business days out is fine. It will not raise any eyebrows. Now I will answer your question more generally. You should schedule the second interview as early as you are comfortable setting it. Some benefits of scheduling the second interview earlier rather than later are: 

I work in an office that relies heavily on Google Calendar scheduling. It is a technical group, and no doubt (almost) everyone understands that the options you outlined are available to them. Even so, here are some reasons I often find myself emailing invitations before the calendar meeting is setup: 

Start by being patient. Explain to him that there's a lot to take in, so you're probably not going to grasp all the details immediately, and you're going to need him to go over some of the knowledge from time to time. Add that it's better that you learn this stuff well, and make sure that you've got it right, than have him just deliver one presentation, expect you to immediately learn and understand everything, and then have you make mistakes. On the other hand, also try to reduce how much you need to ask him by writing down as many of the details as you can when he's transferring knowledge. Hopefully this will help you remember things, but more importantly, you have the details written down somewhere which means you can consult that source of knowledge, rather than your colleague. His expectations of instant understanding are unrealistic, but there's little to be gained from direct confrontation, so if you explain what you need to know, and point out that it'll improve the quality of your work if he tells you this - plus you make an effort to write it down - then he can't have so many reasons to grumble. 

Everyone does things differently, and what they're looking for to fill each job differs, so there'll be a huge variety of things that might be included. What it sounds like you will probably get is an interview with a prospective team lead, an interview with a senior developer who may ask you technical questions, potentially a technical test or problem-solving exercise, possibly preparing some sort of presentation, possibly some sort of technical quiz, possibly also an interview with someone HR-related to see how you'll fit in. It won't be all of the above, but I think that those are the most common elements you'd expect to see. If there was significantly more than that, the interview would be more than three hours. They may or may not have other candidates around interviewing at the same time, so you might be sitting around with them and waiting for part of this time. Be friendly, remember that while you may be in competition for the job, the company will be looking for a team player. In general, be prepared to do stuff as well as present yourself to interviewers, but for a junior development position it may not be too specific or demand you show specific technical knowledge they're expecting you to already have. Try and relax and treat it as much as a learning experience as an interview. Being a bit development-specific, make sure you know what technology stack/languages the company uses, and be prepared to work either with them or with pseudocode that looks like them. The more you can look like you'll fit in easily and need the least training to adapt to what the company is doing, the better you'll look. 

It shows that you are confident and enthusiastic about the position. It limits the window during which the interviewer(s) can choose to hire someone else, or during which a new candidate can apply. If your first interview went well (it did; they asked you back) you will be fresher in the minds of the original interviewers, if they participate in the second round. Limiting the amount of time between the first and second interview limits the amount of time their favorable impression has to change. It may also feel more "natural" if you are fresh in the interviewer's minds. 

If your team lead was simply working at a faster pace than you, I would give different advice. But it sounds like your team lead is picking up work that has already been partially completed by you. In my mind, a pattern of this behavior is not OK by the team lead (justification below). 

The benefits of delaying the second interview will be, in most cases, less significant. If the second interview is a technical interview it may be tempting to give yourself multiple days to "study". But, unless it is an unusual technical interview in which you have something like a study guide, my experience is that most technical interview space is simply too broad to study for in the way you might study for a test in school. Please do note that I suggest you schedule the second interview only as early as you are comfortable setting it. Your performance during the interview will weight far more heavily than any advantage you might gain or lose by choosing the interview date. The best thing you can do to maximize your performance is to be present and relaxed. This becomes very had to do if factors besides the interview are stressing you out. Interviews are stressful enough! Choose a date and time where you will not be rushing to the interview And make sure it is far enough out that you have emotionally recovered from the stress of the first round interview. But please don't take this advice to the extreme and try to schedule your round two interview, like, 15 minutes after being contacted. That might be perceived as weird :) 

Talk to your manager - either to have a word if this colleague is their responsibility, or to pass it through the appropriate channels. If you've already appealed to the colleague directly to change their behaviour, I wouldn't try anything further directly, just talk to your manager and ask them to deal with this. In the meantime, I would advocate going to the meeting room as much as possible anyway. First, it allows you to talk more freely - you can discuss work as you're actually going to implement it, and more junior colleagues can feel that they can ask questions about things they don't understand without being belittled. Second, it withholds information from the problem colleague - if there are things he doesn't know about what you're doing, he might be less willing to assume that his answer will be correct, just in case he hasn't taken everything in to account and makes himself look bad for being wrong. You can then follow this up with references to "As we discussed at the meeting" in conversations that are in the problem colleague's hearing - he can't easily continue this behaviour if he doesn't know what you're talking about. 

This may not immediately read like "brilliant coder!" but this will show that you've worked with an existing codebase, you can communicate with people to understand the problems they're having, work with the existing design to understand that your fix isn't breaking something else, and generally explain what you were doing during your internship without having to go into source-code-specific details. Again, as noted by Lilienthal in the comments, be prepared to talk about all this at interview, go in-depth about how you did things, but not about the details of the source code you were working on. 

If you can, give him a little space to get used to the fact that you're not interested. If he was interested, he's got the hint that you're not, and with some space and time, he should get over it. If he wasn't, then neither of you was interested and everything's fine. If you confront him, he'll probably stick to the "not into you" line, and might even get annoyed, which doesn't do anyone any good. He's said he's not into you, take his word even if it's not true, that's your fastest way to resolve this situation. I don't know the precise circumstances of your pair programming or how much of a requirement that is, but if you can get on with some stuff on your own and then have him look through it, or break up your time with him in some other way ("We can work on Project X until 11 but then I need to {perform other task} so it's done before lunchtime" or similar) then that can help ration his time with you and give you more control over things. If you can, find reasons to spend time working with the other developer - more expertise, or a fresh pair of eyes, or whatever. Talk to your manager, express a preference for less pair programming with your current task, more development and then review. Try to express these things as positive changes rather than just "My colleague is acting weird" - that turns it into more of a conflict with your manager looking into it, and that makes it more of a problem, and focusses more attention on his (probable) lie about not being interested, which makes him feel worse, which just makes the problem bigger. If he's doing anything inappropriate or unhelpful in a work context, keep a diary of what and when, and take that to management as evidence. But if he's just unhappy and things are awkward, bringing that to management makes it look like there's a problem between you and him. I get that you want your voice to be heard, and you're not comfortable having to spend so much time with him, but try to present positive reasons for being elsewhere rather than negative reasons about your colleague. Above all, stay professional, and focus on the work and getting it done. If he's more interested in something else, and is now sulking/whatever, then this will become obvious and his behaviour will be looked in to. I very much hope that this problem will pass, but if it doesn't, you'll be very much on safer ground having been trying to not just get on with work but improve things. 

Pulling her aside and dealing with it blatantly might be the easiest way, but personally I would leave that as a least resort, specifically because of 

Some companies (especially successful ones) value morale and attitude, and may not tolerate this behavior. If his behaviour is as severe as you say it is, find out what the policies are, and if you can get the other employee to agree to back you up on his behavior you may have to report him or tolerate working with him. If you can, block it out and do the best job you can, he either won't move up, or he will leave. I agree, working with someone like that just plain sucks. You say he acts positive in front of management, but his attitude may not carry over to his work in the long run. If he is not actively disturbing you, and it is just in day to day conversation, you can be really positive, and point out all the things you like. Either he is going to be the sort of person that will fight you on it (in which case you can take it to a supervisor and quote him), or he may realize that you will not sympathize with his poor attitude and leave you alone. You may have to try and control the conversation in meetings, and make statements such as "Well, thats not really relevant we have to do that work anyways regardless of how you feel about it." As to why he is so negative, some people, are by nature, incredibly negative. They may not even realize it (which doesn't excuse the behavior). They may have depression (in which case its up to him to seek treatment), be self-absorbed, or just plain believe the world owes them something in which case nothing will ever be good enough for them. If he is actively interrupting your work you can bring up the fact that you are busy, you don't have a problem with whatever xyz negative issue he is bringing up, and that you would like to get on with it, and you rather like working there. If the behavior continues, this then becomes something you can bring to your supervisor and mention the fact that he is disturbing staff just to complain.
