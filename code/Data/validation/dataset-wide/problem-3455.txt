A company's value, in financial terms is given by its equity, or its difference between its assets and liabilities. The well known expression $E=A-L$ reflects this. When you buy a share, you buy a part of the equity. The point is that since the world we live in is dynamic, decisions today affect outcomes tomorrow. As a result, when you buy part of this equity, you are buying part of the claims on the firms' expected future profits. The market rewards those goods that consumers demand more with a higher price and one can definitely make the argument that a firm's future profits are conditional on it producing goods/services that are valued by the public. Whether or not the goods themselves improve the lives of consumers is a separate question altogether. Do we always buy goods that improve our lives? What does that even mean? 

I am surprised none of the posts above discuss the following paper: Autor, D., and M. Handel. "Putting Tasks to the Test: Human Capital." Job Tasks and Wages" Journal of Labor Economics (2009). This paper discusses your concerns and addresses why your concerns are quite well grounded in both theory and empirics. Tasks that are more routine do offer lower wages. In a sense, traditional neoclassical models are wrong in their following prediction: $w=MP_{n}$. It is far fetched to believe that workers are paid their marginal product in the neoclassical sense. More than just contributions to total product, what matters is how replaceable a worker is. Jobs that can be automated in a sense, will offer lower wages. 

I am currently using Mishkin's textbook "Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets." The chapter on financial crises starts with the causes of financial crises. One reason given is the Unanticipated Decline in the Price Level. I quote "In economies with moderate inflation, which characterize most industrialized countries, many debt contracts with fixed interest rates are typically of fairly long maturity (ten years or more). In this institutional environment, unanticipated declines in the aggregate price level also decrease the net worth of firms. Because debt payments are contractually fixed in nominal terms, an unanticipated decline in the price level raises the value of borrowing firms' liabilities in real terms, but does not raise the real value of firms' assets." I get that as the value of money is increasing over time (deflation), the real value of the debt is increasing. What is the reason for asset values to not be rising? If the nominal value of the assets stay the same, then assets will be rising in real value (as money is becoming more valuable). Am I missing something obvious? 

Check out Estimating the Return to Schooling: Progress on Some Persistent Econometric Problems by David Card (2001) ECA I know distance from school has been used in the past as an IV..although it has been criticized. 

I had asked this question on cross validated before, and have deleted it. Suppose we have a standard wage equation: $$w_{i}=β+β_{1}educ_{i}+x_{i}'\gamma+ϵ_{i}$$ where educ corresponds to education levels, $x_{i}$ is a vector of covariates. If we treat educ as a continuous variables, we obtain a single estimate of $\beta_{1}$ . However, if we create dummy variables for different education levels, and therefore allow for different marginal effects (assuming we have a large enough sample size), we obtain k−1 different estimates of education levels if we include a constant. Can we think of think of the single estimate obtained from treating education as continuous as a weighted average of the k-1 coefficients, weighted by the number of individuals in each education block? 

The conditional mean of $Y$ given $X$ is:$$E[Y|X]=\int yf(y|x)dy$$ What is the relation to the linear model? I have read somewhere that when X and $Y$ are normal (their marginal distributions), then the conditional mean of $Y$ becomes a linear function of $X$. How can I see this? 

I asked a similar question on Cross Validated, but got no answer. The following question is sufficiently different. Consider the following deterministic relationship:$$Y_{t}=C_{t}+I_{t}+G_{t}+(X_{t}-M_{t})$$ If we run an OLS regression of Y on the covariates, of course, we get an $R^{2}$ of 1, and the vector of coefficients equal to their population counterparts, i.e. $$\hat{\beta}= \beta=1$$ Now, this means the marginal effect of each regressor is constant. However, the contribution of each regressor depends on its relative variance to y. In fact, in the univariate case, it can be shown that:$$R^{2}=\beta^{2}\frac{var(x)}{var(y)}$$ which shows that even when the marginal effect of $x$ on $y$ is large, its contribution in the partial $R^{2}$ sense is high only when it varies a lot, causing y to vary with it as well. Now, consider the same above expression:$$Y_{t}=C_{t}+I_{t}+G_{t}+(X_{t}-M_{t})$$ Let us divide both sides by $Y_{t}$ for the entire vector of coefficients and the design matrix. We get:$$1=\frac{C_{t}}{Y_{t}}+\frac{I_{t}}{Y_{t}}+\frac{G_{t}}{Y_{t}}+\frac{(X_{t}-M_{t})}{Y_{t}}$$ This holds for each realization of $Y_{t}$ and the design matrix by construction. Now, each regressor here is the relative contribution (which we can multiply by 100 to get percentage contribution) to the dependent variable. Now that we have the relative contribution for each regressor for each observation, we can get the mean contribution of the regressor across observations. I ran some simulations, and found that the mean contribution of each regressor is close, but not exactly equal to the partial $R^{2}$ of each regressor. Is there any relationship between them? Intuitively, they should be the same, right? Thanks a lot! 

I asked this question on math.stackexchange but deleted it from there and brought it here. I had a question about Constant Elasticity of substitution type preferences of the form: $$U=\int_{0}^{1}(c(\omega)^{\rho}d\omega)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}$$ where the paramter $\rho$ governs the degree of substitutability between goods. Here, $c(\omega)$ represents consumption of good $\omega$ which exists on the unit interval. As such, this type of preference specification aggregates over consumption of different goods. My question is as follows. I have always thought of integrals of the form: $$I=\int f(x)dx$$ as approximating sums of areas of infinitesimally small rectangles (in terms of their base) and heights being determined by $f(x)$ . In the case of the example above, what really is $c(\omega)$ ? Is it a function? 

I have recently encountered (in a few applications), the Dixit-Stiglitz Pricing index. Consider a Constant elasticity of substitution form of utility $$U=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}^{1-\frac{1}{\sigma}}\right)$$ This index basically aggregates prices to give a general term as a function of prices that yields a unit cost of utility. How is the index derived? 

I am using the Williamson Macroeconomics textbook to look over a chapter on Monetary Policy and Banking (Chapter 12, 5th Edition). For a bit of context, the author specifices the government budget constraint as: $$PG+\left(1+R^{-}\right)B^{-}=PT+B+M-M^{-}$$ wherein it can be understood as a flow budget constraint. The term $PG$ is the amount in dollars of government purchases, and the term $(1+R^{-})B^{-}$ is the payment due on outstanding government debt. The LHS therefore corresponds to government outlays. The RHS consists in nominal terms, government recepits. The first term $PT$ measures nominal taxes, $B$ denotes government bonds, and the final term $M-M^{-}$ deenotes change in nominal money supply. The question relates to what would happen the nominal money supply increased (the last term $M-M^{-}$ increased). The explanation on page 455 is as follows: because both sides have to be equal, and one part of the RHS has increased, something has to give way. That means either $PT$ has decreased or $B$ has decreased or both to preserve equality. In the case that $PT$ does not change, the author explains that the government could reduce the quantity of bonds $B$ that it issues during the current period. This is an open market operation wherein the fiscal authority issues debt, and the monetary authority purchases some of this debt by issuing new money. In essence, the author argues that $M-M^{-}$ increases as $B$ decreases. This does not make sense to me, however. If the fiscal authority were to issue more debt, would $B$ not increase? That is, the quantity of bonds in the market would go up in this open market purchase. Am I missing something obvious? Many thanks! 

This is not correct. It will be a bit complicated to derive this formally, so I will provide a rule of thumb. For a time dependent variable that is a function of a ratio of two other time dependent variables: $$ y(t)=\frac{A(t)}{B(t)} $$ the growth rate of $y(t),$ call it $\tilde{y}=\tilde{A}-\tilde{B}$ where the RHS is the difference between the growth rates of $A(t)$ and $B(t)$. You can apply this to your question. 

Interesting question. You will have to make the assumption that the second firm is indifferent between not producing and earning 0 profit. Actually, the way you have set it up, the firm makes 0 profit anyway. If the case is that $c_{1}<c_{2}$ , then case 1) that you have mentioned is the Nash Equilibrium. This is similar to a second price sealed bid auction with known valuation- the player with the highest valuation bids the second highest player's valuation so that the second player is indifferent between bidding 0 and her own valuation. Let me point out that if you don't make the indifference assumption, then many games may not have a Nash equilibrium given the always possible epsilon deviations. 

When you have empty cells (and by empty cells, I assume that you are referring to a missing value of an observation specific variable), then STATA by default drops the entire row. So in a sense, even when you have a single missing value on a variable and you have say 100 variables, you lose the whole row (the entire observation). This is by default. If you want to avoid this, perhaps think about imputing the missing data points. 

As far as I know, a lot of universities offer online courses that map closely to the topics you have mentioned. Coursera is one such online resource that amalgamates courses across universities. Perhaps you can check out Mathematics for Economics class if its available. 

The Control Function Approach (proposed by Heckman-1979 if I remember correctly) , is similar to an IV strategy in spirit, except that it can be used in a non-linear setting, such as Probit/Logit models etc. For instance, if you have endogeneity in a logit model, you cannot just run a 2SLS procedure as the first step is a linear projection of your x on your z, and the second step is nonlinear. There are two ways of handling endogeneity in nonlinear models: control function approach and a special regressor approach. 

When we solve Bellman equations, I normally would think of the Blanchard Kahn technique. But in the case that I have an optimal stopping problem, or where the decision that the agent has to take is to choose the maximum from two alternatives , I am not sure about how am I supposed to solve/proceed. There is no Euler equation because the problem is discrete. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks! 

I am a bit confused about when to consider a separate optimization problem and when to combine different problems into a single optimization problem. Consider an individual who derives utility from consumption:$$\sum_{t=1}^{T}\beta^{t}u(c_{t})$$ and is given a stochastic endowment of money every period, that is $y_{t}$ . Now, if there are no savings, I understand given that $u'>0$ that optimality dictates that $c_{t}=y_{t}$ . If there were savings, however, we would write down a Lagrangean, and use FONCs to get Euler equations. My question is as follows: when can optimize for each period separately? Will it be when the periods are linked in some way? If the arguments we wish to maximize over are independent of each other (across periods), can we consider separate maximization problems?
