The best people are in short supply. Sure, it would almost certainly be easier for them to hire a local, or someone from the european union – less paperwork – but if you're the best qualified for the job, then figuring out how to do the paperwork might well be the best option for them. After all, they only have to do the paperwork once, and you will hopefully give them years of service. 

"Hi, [Colleague], Thanks for your question about giving me a French keyboard. Unfortunately, I'm a touch-typer and have got used to the US keyboard layout, so switching to a French keyboard would cause a big drop in my productivity. Is there some reason I can't have a US keyboard? If a US keyboard is really out of the question, are there any other options? Perhaps an external US keyboard I can use when I'm at my desk? Thanks for your help." 

TL;DR> There is an enormous opportunity for you here. However, realising that opportunity will involve a lot of work, likely take you out of your comfort zone, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. If you're not willing to put in the hard work to get the potential (though not guaranteed) reward, then maybe you should move on. Details You know something that the C-level executives don't; converting the company so it can make data-driven decisions will likely bring a big benefit to the bottom line. You also know at least some of the necessary steps to take before the company can become data-driven. If you can persuade the executives that the benefits are real, and large, and that you are the person who can help them realise those benefits, then this could be a seminal moment in your career. However, it seems that these particular executives are not detail-focused. If they were, then the benefits of more data would likely already be apparent to them. So you have to figure out what is important to them, and find a way of speaking to them in terms that make sense to them. They pay people – for example you – to take care of the details for them, and they need you to distil the information into stuff that they care about. You will need to spend some time laying foundations of credibility, and working with your boss to understand what it is that the C-level execs care about. Then find some way of using your data to address at least part of one of the exec's areas of interest. Demonstrate some value from the data. Then explain that with more, or better, data, you could be addressing their concerns more effectively. You want them to be asking you to provide information to help support their decisions. Note that raw data probably isn't useful information to them. Scatter plots will probably just look like ants on a page to them, but a nice clear trend line will carry a message that they can actually do something about. If that all sounds like too much work, then you're probably in the wrong place. 

Hello I am local app developer, for free, look at my previous work, if you respond we can work things out 

5 days later I'm thinking about replying a week later leaving my phone number. EDIT FOR MORE INFORMATION: This is a local business that runs a trampoline warehouse, with mostly kids and young adults. I probably did bug them too much, and I regret being so eager. They were the first guys I ever emailed and I was so so so surprised that they responded. In terms of pitching, I'm trying my best to avoid the argument "because everyone has an app" and I'm going for the practicality angle. I want to implement Android Pay, online waivers, push notifications. In the end, a lot of it is for image. Maybe that's not the best plan, heck they already have a responsive web design. The reason I wanted to work for free is that they probably cannot trust me yet, I've shown them my past work and it is not overly professional (I'll keep working at it). On top of that, they don't seem to be hurting without it. In fact, me building an app benefits ME more than THEM, because I want the reputation as well as something for applications. If I charged a fee, I'm not sure I would get an offer at all. Plus, it might seem presumptuous for me to make the demand first. I'm not hurting in terms of money, though, this is more like a side thing. Are they a dream client? In terms of reputation it would look good. I thought maybe I could help build free apps for local churches, because I'm not in the powerful position of asking for pay. At least, not for my first project. I appreciate all of your answers! This is a big first step for me and I'm trying to be careful! EDIT 2: Also should clarify: when I say local, I mean I live in a small city. Technically, however, I believe it is part of a larger chain that opens stores by different names. They charge like $15 tickets and I'm under the impression that their party package sales are slowing down; it's probably functioning on unicorn hype. I do not believe that a small side app will increase ROI (even if the I is very small. Admittedly, it's probably not a priority for them. Their business (I would guess) would do well with community advertising. My current motives: if any company takes up my offer and uses my app, I've already won. I know you think I am setting the bar low, but I would just like the experience, the "freelancing" reputation, and a little civic pride. 

You seem to be operating under a fundamental misunderstanding of the engineering process, underestimating your boss's abilities to solve engineering problems, and probably overestimating the scope of his goals in becoming personally involved. Engineering is about self-directed acquisition of new skills when needed No one will last their career on the strength of the specific tools, technologies, styles, or even methodologies learned only in formal education. Your boss knows that, sees a problem within their responsibility, and is using the available resource - you - to help them gain the necessary knowledge to begin to address a problem which will remain theirs but soon cease to in any way be yours. Goals may be limited, Maintenance is easier than Design You seem to believe that your software requires immense experience to work on, but this is probably untrue. Rather, it required the strength of your experience to design but now that a lot of it is there, many everyday (or at least "bridge until a replacement is found") tasks like bugfixes and minor feature changes are practically a matter of programming by example, which is something anyone who calls themselves an Engineer of any sort should be able to manage in an emergency. That's not to say that the boss will be able to finish your project even if that is their present goal, or that even their bugfixes will be sound. Mistakes can happen, and they may realize they are in over their head. But the company is in infinitely better shape when the remaining technical lead has gained some meaningful sense of the internal working of your code, than it would be if you walk out the door leaving behind no one with any knowledge of it. Be glad the Trainee is the Boss You're also lucky that the person the boss has assigned to be trained by you, is the boss themselves. If there are issues with the training process, they will know that first hand and see that their goals are not being met - which puts you in a far better position than needing to go to the boss and explain why you've been unable to train the QA inspection intern to perform neurosurgery. Your Options are Limited Likely your only real course to veto this is exercise whatever right you have to limit the remaining time you expend working for the company in any capacity. Explaining your work to your boss is almost always an appropriate task, in whatever level of detail they request. Pretty much the only time you get to object to doing that is when you can make a convincing argument that time spent explaining will be time you can't spend solving the actual problem. But since you are leaving, and their request is for training and not further development work from you, that argument does not seem to apply.
