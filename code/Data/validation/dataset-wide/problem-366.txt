TL;DR: It would take 10 YEARS only to refund this project. With a \$224M input, nobody will really do this, but it's possible! Of course, that doesn't mean that it will happen. PS. If you see I made a mistake, please tell me (but don't try to find a mistake, please :) ) 

Now, let's calculate, how much water to convert can we afford: Each day, can use $9 × 10^{14}$J to convert water to methane. For each kilogram, we need $294000 + (180 × 10^6 × 0.9) = 162294000$J. With $9 × 10^{14}$ J every day, we get $\frac{9 × 10^{14}}{162294000} = 55455000$kg of water converted every day. That is also a 194000kg load of salt. 

So, altogether, we get $$9700 + 244000 + 889500 + 3000000 + 554550 = 4700000$ $$ Every day. That is $4700000 × 365 = 1715000000$ \$ a year. How much does the project cost? What is needed to buy: 

One theory of human brain development is based on Social Intelligence. As humans began living in larger social groups (tribes and clans) our brains doubled in size to track these complex relationships. My sister's husband is off limits, but I can date my sister's husband's brother. My father's enemy's son is my enemy.... We have complex social rules which are fundamental to us, but really have no purpose in nature so it wouldn't evolve directly. Instead, as the theory goes, we needed to keep track of who was who in the "in circle" around the various alpha positions and their families in society. If your family is close to the king this actually does impact your genetics, over and over in numerous ways. Children of the king's friends get married and you have an aristocracy – tracking a royal heir can sometimes be a societal obsession, and even in social animals the children of alpha females are treated better because of nepotism (nepotism literally means "nephew-ism"). Scheming men and women breed with the powerful, and they have powerful scheming children. This consolidates to an evolution of social intelligence that has nothing to do with mechanical engineering or scientific observation. It might however be related to language skills, persuasiveness, charisma. It also might explain cult leaders and narcissists who exploit a kind of social control over people even when it seems to defy logic. How much of today's telecommunications and broadcast media is simply about the relationships of status individuals in society? So if your critters have a strict social pecking order with lots of complicated rules they are expected to follow, they could be a society of backstabbing power-climbing schemers who are savvy and manipulative without necessarily being hammer and screwdriver intelligent. 

Imagine this situation: One warm night of 1890, you go home from a pub. You pass a creepy house. In the half-open door, you see the outline of a machine. You go in, and open the lights. You see a big machine, exactly like those time machines you imagined of when you were small. You sit in it, pull the lever, and... you fall out. The worlds goes black. Then, you wake up, and you see everything is different. It isn't nighttime anymore, the room you are in looks a bit different then you remembered, and... there are two city officers shouting on you what the hell are you doing here. You ask, "What year is it?". "1890" "What!? Are you kidding me?" Sounds like you just got drunk too much last night. But the problem: They think you came from the future! That this is some kind of modern 20th century time machine you are on. The guards insist you come with them to some place and say something about time travel. You exclaim: "But I'm not from the future!" "We're not going to let you run just like that! You just came from another time and we're gonna let you go? No way! Now come on!" So you screwed up. Again. How on Earth can you prove you're not from the future to a 19th/20th century person? How could you prove this to a 21st century person? 

I think, like many posters before me, that it's highly unlikely that all members of a civilization would collectively come to the conclusion that suicide is the solution. The will to survive is too great with most species. We can, of course, imagine a civilization of genetic defeatists but how did they get to the position of civilization in the first place? A major cataclysm such as Nigel222 suggests may of course give inclination to just give up and check out early for a majority of the species. (With further members being killed in lawless chaos once governments collapse.) Leaving only a small splinter of the previous civilization who no longer can uphold the scientific and industrial advances of their precursor and as such can say have devolved into something else. The ur-civilization is now dead, even though members of the species which constituted it are still alive. However, as AlexP's examples show remainders of the species may over time come to power as a new civilization. While Roman, Ottoman and Chinese civilizations have come and gone the human civilization persists. So, how do we kill off an entire world by collective suicide in the face of existential crisis? Well, I suppose if we're going by the OP's original premise that this crisis erupts with the intelligentsia who are smart enough to recognize the futility of carrying on this may, at a sufficiently advanced technology level, create enough problems to kill of enough the less sensitive parts of the population. Possible scenarios are: 

In the 2013 film Space Pirate Captain Harlock, the protagonist's ship runs on "dark matter". It is never explained in any technical way since it is supposed to be a spooky alien technology (side effects include bringing people back from the dead). Compare to a Phantom Drive or a portal powered by a graveyard. In astrophysics, dark matter is a placeholder for something we don't understand. Our galaxy (for instance) moves in a way that suggests it weighs more than it should, based on what we can detect. That discrepancy could be solved if there is more there there, hence "dark" or "unknown" matter. In another era it might have been called "X matter". 

Solar storms. "Streams of particles launched from the sun in the solar wind increase the number of lightning strikes on Earth by 32%." From the article: "Activity on the sun significantly increases the rate of lightning strikes on Earth, say researchers, making it feasible to predict when lightning strikes will become more frequent. They discovered that when streams of high-speed solar particles strike the Earth's atmosphere, the average number of lightning strikes increased by 32% for more than a month afterwards. The study is the first to implicate the solar wind – the stream of particles launched from the sun at over a million miles per hour – in triggering lightning, a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists." The original paper is here: $URL$ In summary: it was previously assumed that galactic cosmic rays (GCR) was a source of lightning, and the solar wind helped shield the Earth from their effects, however the study which included 16 years of data shows the opposite effect. For 4 to 5 days after a solar event the amount of lightning drops, but that is followed by a period between 8 and 40 days after the solar event where lightning activity increases. The researchers suggest some mechanisms involving the solar wind alone, and the solar wind interacting with GCR, but they admit they do not know the actual reason. 

Philosophical differences is probably the easiest sell. A war could easily start over a sect of any major religion (or a new one) deciding that the human die off is God's will and either want to help out or hope to change the divine mind by appeasing it. ("We all must conform to these simple rules about food and clothes, then God will make us fertile again" ... basically the setting for Handmaids Tale thought... so I might end up feeling derivative.) As other users have already pointed out general hopelessness might very well cause an outbreak of violence. Look at, for example, Children of Men which has a rather similar scenario as the one described. However, while most fiction deals with the worst of humanity surfacing in a crisis most studies of real disasters do show that on at least a local level people tend to cooperate. So it might not be the best motivator, it's a powerful trope which we all know. But it is a trope.

I recently watched this series of videos on Primer Fields. The videos are slow, but he goes into detail about the shape and the magnetic properties. Sounds like it might be a good fit for your loop magic. Skip to 45min for this demonstration. It's a good analogy for how our physical plane could be held in place by two opposing energy fields: 

The red could be a dye so a fluid leak would be visible and therefore easier to patch without taking the whole unit off line for diagnostics. An internal gauge might show a drop in fluid pressure, but wouldn't show where the damage has occurred. 

So to get back to your question, any mid-foodchain creature that is using its wits, memories, or social skills to avoid being eaten, store food, and raise healthier children can be considered to have evolved intelligence. As to the last question about top-predators, the same rules apply. Some predators benefit from social intelligence and co-operative child rearing, and even use co-operative physics to hunt, but other top-predators are loners who hide their vulnerable babies while hunting and hope for the best. Some top-predators are their own worst enemies, for example lions where the females live co-operatively but the males are responsible for most infant mortality, and this article talks about the fallacy of confusing the survival instincts of the individual with the survival of the species. 

"My hearts were in the right places," Zblu'tras defended itself. "But who knew they would take the gift of music and pervert it so? This cacaphonous 'pop music' is clearly not what we intended." "Don't forget that guy who made flesh sculptures out of his neighbors," another servitor of Miihyagaa squealed with delight. "My mistress especially enjoyed that part, even if the neighbors clearly didn't." Xaxhazztrax the Daemon Chairman sighed. "Oh well, we can't say we didn't try. Who votes we clean the slate with a comet and see what the bugs can come up with instead?" 

In theory services will be performed by those who can charge the least for them. Tasks that require giants will be performed by giants who charge a liveable giant wage for them while tasks that requires gnomes will be manned (gnomed) by gnomes who will be paid what a gnome requires to live. A gnome can't perform a giant's task and vice versa (a giant can't even survive on a gnome salary thugh so that's a moot point). Tasks that require ordinary sized humans will naturally be performed by ordinary sized humans. Basically you're getting a caste based work market. And as long as everyone is fine with their lot and as long as there is no inside manipulation from the market players it might even work. Of course... without religious strictures surrounding the caste system you'll probably end up with employers trying to find ways to sell off a job to gnomes as they'll work the cheapest. So the gnome job market will likely be the most diverse. The giants get the short end of the stick since they're the most expensive to maintain and their job marked will hold the least amount of diversity. However, you might want to note that keeping giants happy is a societal survival trait. Your society will probably want to find ways of keeping all giants gainfully employed even if it's costly because when a giant with a lot of spare time on his or her hands have an axe to grind it's usually a huge frickin' axe. (The real world comparison to look into would be failed states with decommissioned armies that have not been properly disarmed.) The obvious way to keep the giants in work would be to finance giant work projects by issuing taxes and levies on the other castes, which has the double benefit of also going towards closing the wage gap. Of course, employers don't really like levies and taxes so there will be controversy surrounding them, at least until the first giant uprising. The other solution: You may want to think about completely separate economies. Giants are paid and purchases things in giant money. Gomes use gnome currency. Never shall the two meet. 

To paraphrase the question: once this "illness" happens, what ability do we lose. OK, by whatever measure, we are half the species we were before, but some individuals would still have all the relative advantages of money and status, corporations would still participate in groupthink, and a genius halved is still a genius when everyone else is also halved. Society stays stratified and probably in the same order as before. Social institutions and governments would remain. But in general, people would be more passionate. Quicker to anger. Fickle in love. Art and culture would regress to slapstick and teen melodrama. Politics and education would suffer, as well as engineering and science. It would be putting the breaks on innovation and social reform. There would be more car accidents, job-related injuries, medical misdiagnoses. There's no way to put a number on it, but your mortality rate would soar. 

Lobsters are born with matching claws, but as they grow older one becomes dominant and they develop into two completely different claws called a pincher and a crusher. The heads on your creature might be similar with one head naturally becoming dominant, and the lessor heads developing for secondary tasks (whatever they may be). 

(Planets and stars are not scaled right) This animation is a bit hard to get, so I made another one which shows the same, just without the stars rotating: 

(Planets and stars are not scaled right) So, for me, this is not possible long-term, with a normal-sized planet, and this would be even more unstable, if one of he stars had a much bigger mass. Edit conducted by the flags: this answer adds perspective - shows through an animation how chaotic this concept is. But the animation isn't the main part - The text (answer) part is. The answer is no, this is not possible long-term. 

It's George Lucas's marketing manager here. We are now working on a new Indiana Jones movie: Indiana Jones and the Blastproof Fridge, where Indiana Jones goes for a quest to find the sacred Superfridge, made by God himself. We're now developing a new blastproof fridge, which will not only be used in our movie, but also put into sale. Here's how it looks like inside: 

I guess this is partly a reality check, but I'd also appreciate some practical ideas about how deep underground people could live and potentially have farms. Would pockets of CO₂ be a hazard? Is geothermal heat or pressure a problem (would they get the bends)? Should I go with this wart idea (I like it because it's revolting)? What else am I missing? 

In an Electric Universe, where space is plasma soup and electromagnetism is the "magic" that can defeat the laws of physics, all stars are connected by invisible Birkland currents. Picture the rope that forms when you touch a plasma ball: 

Your scenario is filled with contradictions. If your planet is in a perfect void, where do the injected gasses come from? For that matter, how is there a sun-like star in a perfect void with no gasses? Are you "building" the star first? As mentioned by others, a Jupiter-sized planet is very unlike an Earth planet. Even an Earth-sized planet at the distance of Jupiter would be very un-Earth-like. Jupiter is so massive it actually pulls the Sun off center – they orbit a barycenter so you are really talking about creating two things, and keeping their orbits balanced and perfectly spaced throughout their construction. As each becomes more massive, they need to move further away from each other to maintain balance.
