She doesn't even care enough to remember which of her eyes the silver specks went to, if I'm remembering a page I can't find right now correctly. 

The short story "Mouse", collected among other places in Smoke and Mirrors, is about a man who is buying a trap to get rid of the mouse in his house. He doesn't want to kill the mouse, so he buys a safe trap. Meanwhile, at home, his wife seems pregnant. She goes away for what seems to be an abortion, and when she comes back, she complains about the pain. As she does so, her husband can't tolerate it and goes away. In the kitchen, the trap has a mouse in it. The man can't kill it, so he takes it gently to his yard and sets the mouse free. 

The first two I can attribute to translation from Chinese to English. What about the third one, Zhan Xixi? Does he have four names, as in "Zhan Zheng Xi Xixi", or is it something else? 

Taking the rest of the passage in context, it seems that the "speaker" does not think to highly on themselves and has no self esteem. It seems there is a group of three people; the speaker, Aurora, and a man (Aurora's cousin) about they are speaking about. The speaker is saying that Aurora's cousin is so "good" that it is almost a bad quality within him, and that is worst thing the speaker can say about him. The speaker also seems to think that Aurora is a much better woman than her. So breaking down the lines you have highlighted, I would interpret the word in question this way: 

I would agree with your first interpretation in that Aurora's eyes are comfort to the speaker and allow them to overcome any shyness or reservations about the encounter. Aurora has way with her eyes that she can just look at you and make you feel at ease. From the passage you quote, there is no hint of an underlying sadness within Aurora. 

I think, just maybe, the name Anka had been added to form a positive connection between the hero of the novel and the symbol of patriotism that Anka of the 1934 film was, to soothe the reaction of censors. According to her Wikipedia entry, Anka was added per the request of Stalin, who named Chapaev his favourite film (ironically enough, so did Vladimir). But then, this is just my speculation. 

During the dinner at the king's palace, Rumata has a conversation with Father Gur, the poet. Rumata offers him a copy of the poets work, in exchange for a promise to write something new: 

The Dreaming is supposed to be a reflection of the real world... or maybe vice versa? In any case, The Dreaming (and Dream), in a sense, define the real world - by defining the things that are not real. 

One of the protagonist of 19 Days - One Day is called Zhan Zheng Xi. Or Zhan Xixi. I'm not sure, because he's been called all three: 

is one of them, having in 2012 awarded their first-ever Song Lyrics of Literary Excellence to Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen. Even further proof is that Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016. 

George also a series of short stories set in what is known as the "Thousand Worlds". So while he says the two works are not the same world, they still might be connected... Alas, he has shot down this theory too... 

So my interpretation of that boils down to... We consider poems and plays to be literature, songs are just shorter more musical versions of that. An opinion piece I found sums it pretty nicely. 

It seems that the argument to be made is that songs are poetry. In essence, songs tell a story and (once writing was thing) are generally written as text. It just so happens that text is meant to be performed. Continuing from the above interview 

In A Dance with Dragons Tyrion spend a bit of time with Illyrio and never is Bronn brought up his thoughts. A few people do remind Tyrion of Bronn, namely Griff. 

Click for full page Therefore, in The Sandman Lucifer fell (literally), and his wings burned, as seen in Season of Mists. In Lucifer, it is implied that he fell, because his wings are burnt as well, but his own recollection is that he didn't fall, but simply left Heaven. At first, I wanted to chalk this up to the simple reason - The Sandman was written by Neil Gaiman, while Lucifer was written by Mike Carey (albeit with help and advice from Neil Gaiman), so the latter could have simply retconned the former. But that doesn't explain why Lucifer's wings were burnt if he didn't fall in the first place. How can those two stories, as told by Lucifer in The Sandman and his own series be made to work with each other? 

In the prologue of Season of Mists (the fifth volume), a family reunion occurs and the six Endless siblings are formally introduced, and have speaking roles: 

Your understanding of the word gamble is a bit incomplete. While the most common usage is with games on chance (i.e. betting money), broader sense is an risk: 

But with such an extensive list where "there are too many to readily list" and over 1,700 fan found references to other works, I would say nothing is out of the realm of possibility! 

Certainly there are those that consider music to be literature. In fact, the organization PEN New England (a chapter of PEN America) which among other things 

Notice how the curves (the fluting) serves to hide the joint in way the flows into the circular structure. Without the fluting those joint are more visible. With a solid piece of marble this is not needed as one can carve and shape the stone in anyway they like without having joints at all. However, I don't think Roark's primary argument is "historical" at all really... it boils down to "First vs Best". A Roark says - "Your Greeks took marble and they made copies of their wooden structures out of it, because others had done it that way." - and that is an argument as old as time and will be made when comparing older works of art to newer ones. Who should we admire more William Shakespeare or Thomas Lanier "Tennessee" Williams? Who should we admire more George Herman "Babe" Ruth or Derek Jeter? Who should we admire more Michelangelo or Salvador Dali? These of course are all subjective questions that whole novels could be written on. Just because you were first doesn't make you the best, but just because you were the best doesn't mean you be recognized as such. Even still Roark's argument was that the Greeks were not even creative, they merely copied what was already done, just with a new material. It would be more like if Dali was famous for painting the Mona Lisa but he used watercolors. In the end, art is almost a wholly subjective field for critique. Roark simply has this view on Greek architecture, regardless of what the masses or experts tell him. He just uses the historical claim to show he has at least applied some level of critical thinking to the issue. 

The part about Time is particularly interesting; Time and Night would have to represent some fundamental forces or events, given they're the parents of such fundamental things as the Endless. However, time was described as non-essential or "bendy", in some regions of space, and especially in Dream's realm, in soft places. It wasn't treated as very important, so it seems a bit odd that the entity who fathered Dream is Time. 

The original Russian version does not use any made-up or composite word for "anisotropic". "Anisotropic" is a real world present in English language; it is used in science, as well as technology. Britannica defines it as following: 

In part 5 of Strugastkys' The Doomed City, when Andrei and his group find the central square, there are countless empty places where statues used to be, and all of them have strange writings. Later the missing statues turn out to be in the Pantheon, where Andrei delivers a speech about... greatness? For some reason, the statues turn away from him to another speaker. 

George has certainly made many references and homages in A Song of Ice and Fire. However, the only direct mention I can find of Dante by Martin is the following: 

You will notice that the Harper cover is shown second even though it is an exact title match while the Bantam "original" edition is listed shown first. Digging a bit deeper the Harper edition is listed as one of seventy-one other formats for A Game of Thrones, while the Bantam is listed as its own work. 

The two other answers have shown the directly George denies the connection, but ice dragons do (might) exist in Planetos... 

The most direct comparison I can see is that the Order was formed to help Edward III pursue his claim on the French throne. The Kingsguard helped Aegon I keep his throne... 

The historical part of - "The famous flutings on the the famous columnsâ€”what are they there for? To hide the joints in the wood" - is accurate. When using squared shapes (i.e. lengths of wood) to build a circular structure (the column) ou will have visible joints. See this picture... 

There will be unmarked spoilers from American Gods here. Pretty much the first job Mr. Wednesday and Shadow pull together is the ATM job; before it, Wednesday asks Shadow to cause a snowfall - by thinking about snow. Shadow does so, and it does indeed snow. The major thing about gods in the novel is that they're powered by belief, specifically by belief of ordinary people (which is actually a recurring theme throughout Gaiman's other works) - when I read that episode I thought this was the case. However, later in the novel we learn that Shadow is not a mere man, but a son of a god. Does that mean Shadow was able to cause the snowfall, do the coin trick (putting the golden coin in place of Sun in Iceland), and influence minds (like with Chad and Sam), only because of his heritage, and not because anyone can focus their belief to shape reality? 

During Dijkstra's visit to Pont Vanis to see king Esterad, the former calls Yennefer a traitor, to which the king retorts that she's not, and that he can provide relevant proof. How does king Esterad know Yennefer is not a traitor, and what kind of proof did he have? 

I am inclined to say that they are the same book, just produced under different publishers. When searching on Amazon (in the United States) for "A Game of Thrones: 20th Anniversary Illustrated Edition". I am presented with the two different covers that your searches also provided. 

to give us the an interpretation of: I admit I am unable to believe in my confidence which is of no help to you or him. 

Ygritte wants to know how special she is. Jon had just gone on and on about how much he loved her and what he loved. 

Possibly some inspiration came from the Order of the Garter. During a general interview regarding question on the Kingsguard he mentioned the Knights of the Garter. 

Tyrion in well aware of what is going on even takes a small verbal jab at Robb to which Robb jabs right back. 

So the story is of how a poor widow gave all she had to the church and therefore was view as giving the most of all those that had donated. Without further context, I am guessing the boy in Don Juan made a similar gesture of giving all he had to something or someone. 

I'm not at all sure as to why the editors would want this scene added - possibly they were trying to do exactly this - shift the blame from Reba to Arata. It is easy to notice that the chapter is very short, and if one was to read the book with this whole chapter missing, nothing would be lost from the plot, and there would be absolutely no reason to suspect Arata as having planned anything against Rumata. 

But it's only fair to point out that some artists apparently did use Neil Gaiman for their depictions of Morpheus. Here, it's Marc Hempel, who illustrated The Kindly Ones. 

I am confused by Father Gur's reply. In original Russian, the last two lines of the conversation are as follows (with bold part matching that in the translation): 

In The Sandman Presents: Lucifer - The Morningstar Option #3 (written by Mike Carey and drawn by Scott Hampton), Lucifer explains he needed Rachel Begai to channel her desire to destroy the Velleity, as he himself is short on desire:
