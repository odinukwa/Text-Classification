Putting together 2, 4, 5 we obtain $$ \det(M)^2 = \prod_{\lambda \vdash n} A(\lambda) B(\lambda) = \left(\prod_{\lambda \vdash n} B(\lambda)\right)^2 $$ and so the claimed identity. 

As I posted in my comment, I think Paul's suggestion does work. Here's a (sloppy) description of how I think things will work: The local systems you describe can be obtained, by passing to homotopy groups, from a "local system of loop spaces" $$ \Omega: \Pi_{\leq \infty} X \to \Omega\mathbf{Spaces}$$ One can imagine that this corresponds under the Grothendieck construction to the free loop-space fibration $\Omega X \to LX \to X$. Alternatively, if we fix a basepoint and identify $X = BG$ for a simplicial group $G$, then this is just encoding the simplicial conjugation action of $G$ on itself. Rather than think about (strangely-graded) Whitehead products, I prefer to think about (reasonably graded) Samelson products: We think of the structure (Whitehead product) on $\pi_{*+1} X $ as really being a structure (Samelson product) on $\pi_{*} \Omega X$. I claim that Samelson products give a functor $$ \pi_*: \Omega\mathbf{Spaces} \to \mathbf{grqLie} $$ so that composing with the above gives our desired "local system of graded (quasi-)Lie algebras". For convenience, I'll replace loop spaces with (strict) simplicial groups. Then, the Samelson product comes from noticing that the commutator map $[,]: G^2 \to G$ is trivial if one of the factors is the identity, and so factors through a pointed map $[,]: G \wedge G \to G$. This pointed map goes on to induce the (quasi-)Lie structure on homotopy. A group homomorphism $H \to G$ preserves commutators and identities, and so induces a map $H \wedge H \to G \wedge G$ compatible with the brackets, so that this construction is indeed functorial. 

Constructing $c_1$ + proving a projective bundle formula, and then feeding this into a general argument using these to prove the rest. Going to the universal example of algebraic cobordism and then deducing the results for Chow + K-theory from the known relationships between them and algebraic cobordism. (Though this second approach is not so great, since those relationships hold under much more stringent hypotheses than are necessary to run the argument.) 

I'd like to propose that the answer is "No, but..". The viewpoint I'd like to suggest is that thinking of "derived functors" is probably insufficient here (because we're secretly interested in homotopical categories that are not derived categories of abelian categories), but that we are relying essentially on the observation that $R\Gamma(X, -) = R\Gamma(Y, Rf_* -)$. So what follows is a sketch-construction that gives a positive answer to a related question you could've been asking: "We can get the Serre spectral sequence from the Leray spectral sequence. Can we get the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence in a similarly sheaf-theoretic way?" 

If your question is one of proof + generalization (which I think it is), rather than vague motivation, then I haven't addressed it yet: In topology. one can show that any complex-oriented cohomology theory (i.e., one with Chern classes for line bundles) $E^*$ has a projective bundle formula, satisfies all the conditions, etc. In more-algebro-geometric contexts, you could deduce the Chow + K-theory (I don't know anything about the $\gamma$-filtration) statements by either 

One could also ask to generalize this in another direction, replacing vector bundles and $Fl(V)$ by more general $G$-bundles and their associated $G/B$-bundles. In general, that's a more complicated story... 

Briefly re 2 and 4: the Ind-completion IndDCoh has shriek pullbacks and star pushforwards. Moreover, it has what one might call "derived h-" descent with respect to shriek pullback. This includes "derived proper" descent -- note that derived is modifying the topology, not just the functors/categories; more on this below. Just to clarify: by DCoh I mean the "bounded coherent" dg- or infinity-category, and by Ind the infinity-categorical Ind-completion (e.g., close up the dg-Yoneda image by filtered homotopy colimits). This is modelled by Krause's homotopy category of objectives, Positselski's coderived category, and variations. In particular, it will not coincide with the usual quasi-coherent derived category unless one imposes regularity: The usual version is IndPerf, so one needs Perf=DCoh. But the gain of this definition is shriek pullback without restricting to cohomologically bounded below complexes, and things like proper descent. (And both IndDCoh and IndPerf have flat descent..) An important point is that one has to pass to derived schemes (not just complexes or dg-categories) to have any hope in the proper case. For non-flat proper maps, the descent condition will thus look very different from the classical versions: one needs to take derived fiber products in forming the Cech nerve. An example giving a feeling for the previous paragraph: Consider the map from a point to a non-reduced point. It is a proper cover, and its classical and derived Cech nerves look very different! Also considering this example one sees that any sort of proper *hyper*descent will always be too much to ask for as it forces insensitivity to nilpotents. I sketch some things like the above in an appendix to this preprint though a much better reference seems to now be available: here eg Section 7.2 

The two topics are logically, if not morally, independent of one another. $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy encodes objects like motivic cohomology & it's relatives which are of interest regardless of the framework. There's no way for algebraic cobordism to supersede that -- algebraic cobordism is more directly comparable to Chow theory and $K^0$ than to motivic cohomology. Conversely, algebraic cobordism provides a more geometric viewpoint on (a piece of) $MGL$ -- surely a valuable thing to have around as well as being of independent geometric interest. That said, if your interests are more motivic than geometric, you could get by without knowing the details of algebraic cobordism provided that you know all the classical statements in complex cobordism that inspired it. Motivic vs algebraic cobordism. The $\mathbb{P}^1$-spectrum $MGL$, or "motivic cobordism," enjoys a privileged role in the world of $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy similar to that of $MU$ in classical homotopy. There is a relationship between this "motivic cobordism" and "algebraic cobordism." The former is a bigraded theory, and Levine showed that $MGL^{2n,n}(X) = \omega^n(X)$. (This bigrading issue is analogous to how Chow theory occurs as the $(2n,n)$-graded piece of motivic cohomology, and explains why you don't get a long exact sequence in algebraic cobordism, etc...) So one can view Morel-Levine's (or Levine-Pandharipande's) algebraic cobordism as giving an axiomatic (or geometric) viewpoint on the motivic theory, like we had for $MU$. Unlike the case of complex cobordism, where one can directly compare it to $MU$-cohomology using transversality results, here the comparison is much more difficult and computational. The proof of this comparison relies on a (currently unpublished) spectral sequence due to Hopkins-Morel. It should be noted that constructing this spectral sequence is hard, and by the time you've constructed it you've had to independently check lots of things that you might've wanted to deduce from the comparison with algebraic cobordism (for instance you pretty much end up computing $MGL^{2*,*}(Spec k)$, you can see the comparison of cobordism to Chow theory, etc.). Degree formula (or, application to B-K) The reference to open problems likely refers to the use of cobordism and Rost's degree formula in the final steps of proving Bloch-Kato for $\ell \neq 2$. Cobordism is a tool in the proof, but introducing algebraic cobordism is not strictly necessary. (One can get by with explicit computations with the characteristic numbers of interest. It'd certainly be fair to like the Levine-Morel proof of the degree formula, though.) The Bloch-Kato conjecture is concerned with the "Galois symbol" map $$ K^n_M(k)/\ell = H^n(k, \mathbb{Z}/\ell(n)) \to H_{et}^n(k, \mathbb{Z}/\ell(n)) = H_{et}^n(k, \mu_\ell^{\otimes n}) $$ No cobordism in sight yet. Suslin-Merkurjev's proof for $n=2$ and Voevodsky's proof for $\ell=2$ made use of "splitting varieties" that one could write down pretty much explicitly and then proceed to study: Brauer-Severi varieties and Pfister quadrics, respectively. This doesn't seem to work for the general case, and instead one writes down a minimalist wishlist for splitting varieties and then has to show that they exist --- it is in this step where cobordism (or really, characteristic numbers) play a role. A "splitting variety" for a non-zero symbol $0 \neq u = u_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes u_n \in K^n_M(k)/\ell$ should be a smooth variety $X/k$ such that $u$ pulls back to zero in $H^n(k(X), \mathbb{Z}/\ell(n))$ ("$X$ splits $u$"), with $\dim X = \ell^{n-1}-1$, and some more technical conditions, including a partial "universality" for this property: $X'$ splits $u$ iff there is a rational map from (a degree prime-to-$\ell$ cover of) $X'$ to $X$; it follows that $X$ must have no degree prime-to-$\ell$ zero-cycles (or else $Spec k$ splits $u$, i.e., $u = 0$). Cobordism (of whatever flavor you like: complex cobordism suffices) enters when relating this to characteristic numbers: namely, to the property of being a $v_n$-variety (=representing a $v_n$ class in complex or algebraic cobordism, up to decomposables). Here, one needs something like "Rost's degree formula", which implies for instance that the property of being a $v_n$-variety with no prime-to-$\ell$ zero-cycles is invariant under prime-to-$\ell$ degree covers. 

We get the Leray spectral sequence by studying sheaves of complexes of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. The "derived" category (of sheaves of complexes of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules) is the derived category of its heart (sheaves of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules) w.r.t. the usual $t$-structure, so it's reasonable that we get lots of mileage from looking at derived functors, composites of derived functors, etc. Analogously, we can think of more general Atiyah-Hirzebruch type spectral sequences as arising from studying sheaves of spectra. This is not the derived category of its heart w.r.t. the usual $t$-structure (this heart is again sheaves of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules). But, this does give a way of thinking about Atiyah-Hirzebruch type spectral sequences: We start with (say) the "constant sheaf of spectra" $\mathbf{E}$ on $X$, and we're interested in computing the (homotopy groups of the spectrum) $$R\Gamma(X, \mathbf{E}) = R\Gamma(Y, Rf_* \mathbf{E})$$ The spectral sequence of interests arises by filtering $Rf_* \mathbf{E}$ using the $t$-structure (Postnikov sections "on values"), $$\cdots \to \tau_{\geq k} Rf_* \mathbf{E} \to \tau_{\geq (k-1)} Rf_* \mathbf{E}\to \cdots \to \mathbf{E}$$ The $k$-th "associated graded piece" of this filtration is $\pi_k Rf_* \mathbf{E}$ (which, recall, is an object in the heart --- i.e., a sheaf of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules on $Y$). This gives rise to a spectral sequence (excuse the funny indexing!, and no comment on convergence) $$ E^2_{p,q} = \pi_{-p} R\Gamma\left(Y, \pi_{-q} Rf_* \mathbf{E}\right) \Rightarrow \pi_{-p-q} R\Gamma\left(Y, Rf_*\mathbf{E}\right) = \pi_{-p-q} R\Gamma(X,\mathbf{E})$$ The funny indexing was picked so that I can rewrite it as $$ H^p(Y, \pi_{-q} Rf_* \mathbf{E}) \Rightarrow E^{p+q}(X) $$ To recover the usual form of AH-SS we need the following observation (analogous to what we'd need to get the Serre spectral sequence via sheaf theory): If $f$ is nice (i.e., a fibration between reasonable spaces), then $\pi_{-q} Rf_* E$ will be the locally constant sheaf associated to $E^{q}(F)$ with its monodromy action. 

Exercise 9.7 (RD): Let $f: X \to B$ be a flat morphism of finite type of locally Noetherian preschemes. Then, $f^!(\mathcal{O}_B)$ has a unique non-zero cohomology sheaf, which is flat over $B$, iff all the fibers of $f$ are Cohen-Macaulay schemes of the right dimension. Moreover $f^!(\mathcal{O}_B)$ is isomorphic to (a shift of) an invertible sheaf (on $X$) iff all the fibers of $f$ are Gorenstein schemes of the right dimension. 

In particular, this addresses the case you mention in your comment ($f$ Gorenstein), since then $f^!(\mathcal{O}_Y)$ is locally free on $X$ and, since $f$ is flat, certainly flat over $B$. [Aside: I believe I learned this reference from Brian's book "Grothendieck Duality and Base Change", which I think also contains a proof of this.] 

In the model structure you describe, the cofibrations should be the retracts of the free relative G-cell maps: i.e., retracts of maps obtained by attaching cells of the form $G \times S^{n} \to G \times D^{n+1}$. One way to see this is via the following general machine: There is an adjoint pair $$ G \times -: \mathbf{Top} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{GTop}: forget $$ $\mathbf{Top}$ is a cofibrantly generated model category and one can check that this adjoint pair satisfies the conditions of the standard Lemma for transporting cofibrantly generated model structures across adjoint pairs (see e.g., Hirschorn's "Model categories and their localizations" Theorem 11.3.2). Thus, it gives rise to a model structure on $\mathbf{GTop}$ such that a map in $\mathbf{GTop}$ is an equivalence(resp. fibration) iff its image under the right adjoint (forget) is so. Moreover, the generating (acyclic/)cofibrations are precisely the images under the left adjoint ($G \times -$) of the generating (acyclic/)cofibrations in $\mathbf{Top}$. This yields the description of the cofibrations as retracts of (free G-)"cellular" maps. Also, some context: The model structure you describe (which I'd like to call "Spaces over BG") is a localization of a model structure "G-Spaces" (where the weak equivalences are maps inducing weak equivalences on all fixed point sets). An argument along the lines of the above constructs this other model structure and identifies its cofibrations with retracts of (arbitrary) relative G-cell maps: i.e., retracts of maps obtained by attaching cells of the form $G/H \times S^n \to G/H \times D^{n+1}$ for $H$ a closed subgroup of $G$.
