It's also worth pointing out that this can be read two ways. Although there's an implication that the discovery has made Wilson want to rewrite her biography, it's not concrete. "I want to rewrite" could be taken as reading that Wilson was planning a revision in any case, and is excited to also include the new material. Indeed, it then goes on to make an entirely separate point about Atrocities, which makes clear that it's only part of the wider "trove". 

Tim O'Brien's novel of the Vietnam War, The Things They Carried, is usually labelled as fiction, even though aspects of it are based on settled history and the author's own experience serving a tour as an infantryman. This blurring of fact and fiction is a key theme of the novel. One of the stories in the book makes a distinction between "story truth" and "happening truth" and argues that one is in no way superior to the other in terms of the actual "truth". However, it would be interesting to know if O'Brien - or anyone else, perhaps a biographer - has ever attempted to split some of the fact from the fiction in the book? 

Yeats was a keen student of Irish folklore and it is clear that the titular character in his poem The Song of Wandering Aengus is based on the pre-Christian Celtic god of love, youth and poetry. However, little of what happens on the poem can be directly linked to surviving stories about the deeds of the god Aengus. Why, then did Yeats choose this figure and what other narrative or imagery from the poem can be linked to the mythical figure? I am particularly interested in whether there is any precedent to similes of the closing lines 

An expression of the flaws that arise in using language to try and understand or express nature. The poet is expressing guilt at his inability to use his own creation to accurately do justice to that of God. Spokes was Auster's first published poem. He would return to its themes of perfect and imperfect language in the plots of his novels City of Glass and The Brooklyn Follies.

Owen does not label a particular action in the poem, but there is supporting evidence to suggest it was inspired by a specific event. Shortly before writing the poem, he put this in a letter home on the 25th April: 

In this moment of supreme terror, the poet is alone and he fears his family and friends will be left equally alone by the event of his death. The final metaphor is instructive: we can be "alone" even when surrounded by people. The second part is also about being alone: 

However, there are two key points during the tale when things the narrator believes appear to be true. 

The "myth of fingerprints" is that by focusing on trivial aspects of ourselves, we appear to be very different when in fact we have much more in common with one another. It's also a literal myth: fingerprints are highly differential but they are not unique. The key to this is the final verse: 

(An aside: the meaning of "aprob" is unclear. It seems likely to be a mis-spelled contraction of either approbate or the latin approbante. See this question on English SE for more details.) And the closing remark on titillation makes it clear that Beckett was making a satirical take on the content of the revue. Further evidence is given by Beckett's negative reaction to the actual staging of the play in which naked actors lay among the rubbish: he called the producer a "liar" and a "cheat". Some of Beckett's other work revolve around rubbish. In his play Endgame, two of the character emerge from rubbish bins. The characters in Waiting for Godot are tramps. His characters are often attached to possessions which appear to the audience as oddments and scrap. Indeed, Beckett's inclination to showcase discarded objects in his work is a continuing source of academic interest - see Beckett's Art of Salvage by Julie Bates for an example. Breath is very short, but other works by Beckett use rubbish as an analogy for life or for the world. In Ill Seen, Ill Said the line 

First up, it is likely that Hunca Munca's name is not relevant to her role in the story. According to her biographer, Judy Taylor, Potter rescued two mice from a trap and decided to name them and keep them as pets. The development of the tale came some months later, when Potter observed that the female mouse kept a tidy nest and, when given the opportunity to explore, chose to "steal" a small doll rather than doll's house food. Given that the genesis of the story came from the mouse's behaviour, well after she was named, it is possible there is no strong link. That does not mean that Hunca Munca's role is not of interest to further analysis. While it might seem odd to go digging for literary meaning in a children's tale, many such stories offer an underlying moral which is worthy of investigation. With an older book such as this there is also added historical interest. One of the most striking things about the tale is that the mice are "bad" - transgressive, as the OP notes. They are not merely bad in their destruction of the doll's house: there are also suggestions they are bad parents. They live in a squalid hole and have a large number of children. In contrast the doll's house that they enter is clean, polite and refined. The response of the mice to this is impulsive aggression and theft. The things they choose to steal are also instructive: they take food and bedding, but reject more refined objects like a bird cage and a book case. It is not hard to view this as a metaphor in which the mice represent the working class "vermin" and the dolls a more genteel middle or upper class society. The Victorian era in which Potter lived was a time when there was much awareness and debate of the value of social responsibility. A number of Potter's tales, including Mrs Tittlemouse and Peter Rabbit, suggest that Potter came down firmly against social help in favour of individual responsibility. The Two Bad Mice break the taboo of ownership by entering and stealing from the house. They take responsibility for this of their own choice, through cleaning and paying for the damage they have done. It is also interesting that the nurse wants to punish them in a far more severe manner, by killing them in a trap. Where, then does Hunca Munca, in particular fit in to this? Her role in the story is almost entirely as a servant and care-giver. She chooses to steal bedding from the house. In recompense, she chooses to clean - every morning - while Tom Thumb gives money once per year. This is a strong reflection of Victorian social stereotypes. A woman is interested in children and in cleanliness, every day. A man, meanwhile, can earn money and enjoys the flexibility and power this provides. In this there is a glimmer of a comparison with her namesake from Tom Thumb: both are passive, servile, happy to accept a fate others have assigned to them. It is interesting to place the reactionary morals of Two Bad Mice against Potter's life. She faced discrimination from the establishment by choosing to marry down in class and, later, by conducting her own business affairs. Quite why Potter chose to re-enforce the very morals that her actions fought against is a matter for conjecture, but it's hard to read her tales in any other way. References: - Taylor, Judy.

Only the narrator Nick, Gatsby's father, and a priest went to the cemetery where Gatsby was to be buried. However, as they went into the cemetery, a man came in, who turned out to be the man whom Nick met in one of Gatsby's parties. In this part, I could not understand what was the "protecting canvas" and how it unrolled from Gatsby's grave. I guessed, since it was raining, the canvas cloth was covering the pit in which Gatsby was to be laid down. But as people arrived, the cloth was now "unrolled." So I wonder why it was described as the "protecting" canvas. I would very much appreciate your help. 

I am reading The Great Gatsby, and would like to know what "if we had room for him" means in the following sentences: 

Reading The Great Gatsby, I encountered these sentences and came to be curious as to what "our identity with this country" means in this context: 

In this part, Daisy, her husband Tom, her lover Gatsby, her relative Nick, and her friend Jordan engaged a suite parlor in the Plaza Hotel to have some mint julep on this stifling day. As Mendelssohn's Wedding March was heard from the ballroom below, Daisy and Tom recalled that their wedding day was also very hot and that someone named Biloxi even fainted. Biloxi was carried into Jordan's house because it was very close to church, and stayed there for three weeks. Here, I could not grasp what "if we had room for him" means here. Did Asa Bird—presumably their friend—bring Biloxi, who wasn't their friend and thus was uninvited, at the last minute of their wedding and asked if they had some vacant seat for him? Or did Asa Bird bring the fainted Biloxi to them and asked some space to lay him down? Or was Asa Bird finding a room for him to stay for a while? I am completely clueless. I would very much appreciate your help. 

I am reading The Great Gatsby, and came to be curious as to the meaning of "ramifications" and "by which" in these sentences: 

The narrator Nick is telling how Gatsby first came into being. Before he became Gatsby, he was named James Gatz; but when he met Dan Cody, who would start him in business and leave him inheritance, he decided to change his name to Jay Gatsby. When he met Gatsby, Dan Cody was soft-minded and was liable to be swayed by women. In this part, I could not understand what "ramifications" and "by which" meant. Are the ramifications some flaws in his character derived from his soft-mindedness? Or the negative results, or rumors, caused by the fact that Ella Kaye pushed him out to the sea? And I would also like to know what "by which" means. Does that mean Ella Kaye played Madame de Maintenon by the none too savory ramifications? If it is the case, what does "by" mean here? Did she use, or took the advantage of, the ramifications? I would very much appreciate your help. 

The narrator Charles, as an architecture painter, travelled Latin America for two years in search of inspiration. He didn't particularly seek to keep in touch with his homeland, and the letters he received sounded so remote to him. In this part, I could not grasp what "the facts about themselves" means. Also, in order to know what "themselves" is, I looked up "fellow travelers" and found the related information on the Wikipedia, and assumed that they were communist sympathizers, but I could not be sure about that either. I would very much appreciate your help. 

I am reading The Great Gatsby, and came to be curious as to what "the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave" means in the following sentences: 

In this part, Daisy, her husband Tom, her lover Gatsby, her relative Nick, her friend Jordan came to the suite parlor in the Plaza Hotel to have some cold drink on the stifling day. The room became the battlefield between her husband and her lover, when each began to claim that it was him that Daisy loved. Tom had made some small "investigation" regarding Gatsby's past, and revealed the information during the argument that he earned his money through not very honorable routes. At this astounding information, Daisy felt her love toward Gatsby fail. Seeing the two already crumbling, Tom generously allowed Gatsby to drive her home. I find the last sentence especially difficult to understand. How could they have been "snapped out"? And I could not grasp what "accidental" means here either—does it mean that their encounter was reduced to a merely accidental one, not a destined one? And what does it indicate that they have become "isolated" and "like ghosts"? I would very much appreciate your help. 

The young Gatsby found his humble family background unsatisfactory; that was why he began to imagine himself as somebody different, divine. Thus he started to reach for a higher goal in his life, such as earning a huge amount of money or winning Daisy's love. But I could not understand especially what "the service of" meant. Does it mean that he provided such beauty? Or that he believed in such beauty? And since "His Father's business" has some Biblical undertone in it, I would like to know whether the boldfaced phrase also has such a tone in it. I am not much knowledgeable when it comes to the Bible, so I would like to know whether there is some description that Jesus serviced some beauty, just like Gatsby, because I think that could give me some hint as to what was indeed "a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty." I would very much appreciate your help.
