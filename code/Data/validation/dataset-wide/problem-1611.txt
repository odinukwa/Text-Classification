Regarding the claim that scratching is a "No Risk" activity, here is a study showing no HIV transmission from scratches and bites from a person with contaminated fingers and mouth: 

tl;dr: No. Marx wrote that Proudhon would say that slavery had good sides (as part of his criticism of Proudhon). This quote is from a letter from Marx to Annenkov. But it is important to look at the context to understand its meaning. The sentence prior to the quote from OP is: 

Even if we subtract all exports to the Netherlands from the exports (which we shouldn't), it is not true that a "very large portion" of exports should be excluded because of this. It is of course true that the Rotterdam effect doesn't just exist with the Netherlands, but as the telegraph notes (citing the ONS): 

This means that the Nuremberg Laws are indeed meant. There are only two parts of them concerning flags. The one you reference, which forbids Jews from using the Reichsfarben, and which allows them to use "jüdische Farben" and the Reichsflaggengesetz, which mainly defines the official flag of Germany, but which does not forbid any flags. 

When I'm using "violence", I mean physical violence in the case of protesters as well as in the case of rally attendees. 

The court documents are sealed and thus not available. Some of the them were still obtained by the New York Daily News, but the deposition in question is missing and was possibly destroyed in a fire. The book that the quote is referring to is "Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump" by Harry Hurt III. In a reprint, the following statement by Ivana Trump was added. The statement was made in 1993. 

Baby was also not only convicted of first-degree rape for the 5 second forced penetration, but additionally of first-degree sexual offense and third-degree sexual offense unrelated to the 5 seconds: 

Maybe. If the post existed, it has since been deleted. More importantly: The facebook page is not maintained by antifa activists. It has been called satire and fake. Looking at the posts, it is obvious that they are from far-right activists. It already starts with the name "Internationalsozialisten", which is a play on words, referring to "nationalsozialisten" (ie nazis). The translation of this post is also not quite right. Correctly, it would be "Prefer sexually hyperactive refugees to German racists". It is obviously making fun of the issue, and suggesting that refugees are rapists (a right-wing topic, not a left-wing one). 

There are at least two sources for this: Donald Trump himself in a People interview and Dana London - who worked for Trump. 

[*] The document contains the logo of Al Mala­hem media, which according to the ADL did release the document, and is indeed associated with AQAP. At the moment, the blog post by the ADL is the most reputable source I could find referencing the document. [**] The first google hit for Lone Jihad Guide Team is the linked document, and no reputable source links it to Al-Qaeda, but as mentioned above, the media that released the document is tied to Al-Qaeda. 

Some states did have protections for victims of domestic abuse before passage of the ACA, but some did not (see also politifact): 

This image shows the banner of a group called LGBT Against Islamophobia. The specific image was taken at Birmingham Pride in 2015, but they were also at other prides such as London Pride. Personally, I agree that it may seem a bit odd to focus on religious discrimination or racism at pride, but I see no irony in one oppressed group being against the discrimination of a different oppressed group. 

This is why the Endocrine Society currently recommends puberty blockers until age 16 instead of cross-sex hormones. The study the WSJ is likely referring to is this one from 1985: 

The idea is rejected by mainstream Christianity, but is supported by the white supremacist Christian identity movement, which claims that only white people decent from Adam, while Jews (and other non-white people) decent from Cain who descends from the serpent. Origin of Menstruation The idea that menstruation is a punishment for Eves supposed misstep exists in Judaism. See eg the Jewish Womens Archive: 

Marx's actual opinion of slavery can be seen in writing such as his letter to Lincoln in which he celebrates death to slavery, The Civil War in the United States in which he argues for the Union side and against slavery, or in Das Kapital where he argues that the workers movement is paralysed as long as slavery exists, and that there can be no labour emancipation without black emancipation. 

I only have access to the abstract, but the title and the abstract already show that polar bears were not the main object studied for this paper. 

Original radaronline.com accusations The original source of this story is radaronline.com. They also provide access to the mentioned police report from 2003[*]. Jackson was charged in 2003 with among other molestation - but not with possession of child pornography - , and acquitted in 2005. The radaronline.com article mixes up a lot of different things - some of them legal, some of them not; some viewed morally objectionable by most, and some not. It talks about "pornography", "S&M", "twisted porn collection", "drugs to treat sex addiction", "adult and child nudity", "female bondage", "sadomasochism", "transsexuals", "animal torture", and "child torture". The only times radaronline.com talks about child porn are: "[a] porn collection — which included filthy photos and videos of men, women, boys and girls in perverted positions" (it doesn't mention what perverted positions are, so it's difficult to know if this actually references child porn) and "sexy photos of his own nephews" (which may or may not be considered "porn", depending on what radaronline.com means by "sexy"). 

Two more news outlets reported about this case, both referencing the Bild: taz and Huffington Post. In a Facebook post, the AfD itself describes the case like this: 

indicating that she hasn't conducted original research. In a further blog post, she justifies her relevance as a "polar bear expert" despite not having made scientific contributions in that area: 

Conclusion The numbers are not about left-wing activists, but about those accused - but not convicted - of a crime in connection with left-wing activism. Only 65 of 873 accused even answered the question about their living situation, and the Verfassungsschutz assumes that people not living at home are more likely not to answer questions about their living situation. The same is true about unemployment: only a fifth answered the question, and the study says that because of this, it cannot make any claim about the actual unemployment rate. 

The majority of prisoners were released under Bush. Only a small percentage of those released under Obama returned to the battlefield (9 are confirmed, and another 11 are suspected). The new 2017 version of the report has also been released this month, and it corrects the number of confirmed re-engagements under Obama from 9 to 8. The original source of the wrong 122 claim is the report from 2016 though. 

Little et al of the Harvard Family Research Project have looked into after-school programs in general and conclude that they improve academic achievement. 

These are not actually rape statistics, but survey results, which the image then incorrectly extrapolates from. According to Business Insider the BJS rejects the given interpretation of these numbers, and they do not use them anymore: 

The Guardian also has an article about this. It also contains a statement by Sports Direct which doesn't deny the existence of this system, but does say that Unite misrepresents their intent. The Daily Mail article may be a bit unclear. Workers seem to have known that they could be identified when pressing the button (see the Unite press release). According to Unite, the reason for this system was not to secretly identify unhappy workers, but to show that their workers actually were happy (they have previously been accused of abusing their workers), and to get those workers that non-anonymously declared that they were unhappy in touch with their manager. 

The paper then goes on to show that the stated correlation between IQ and GDP may be accurate if a clean data set is used, but that doesn't seem relevant to this question. 

Wikipedia claims that a Jewish yeshiva teaches that Jews have different souls than Gentiles. To support the claim, wikipedia says that one of their teachers quoted Abraham Isaac Kook as following: 

No. Apart from the evidence mentioned in the comments - neither Petra Klamm-Rothberger nor her Twitter Account are mentioned on the internet before December 4th - and the fact that the message is longer than twitter actually allows, the German Newspaper Spiegel says that this is a fake story, fabricated by a fake news site: 

The article only mentions unnamed "German scientists" for its claim. The only person named by name is Karen Weatherby, and she is used to support a different claim (looking at breasts is healthy). This claim - and the existence of Weatherby - has been debunked. There is one German scientist claiming this, Ruediger Dahlke, in his book "Der Körper als Spiegel der Seele" (The body as mirror of the soul). He is an esoteric scientist who believes in inedia. He doesn't seem to have done any actual studies. The only other source for this claim is a German tabloid (NSFW), quoting Italian sexologist Piero Lorenzoni. Most of the English speaking articles about this topic seem to have gotten their claims from him as well. He does not seem to have done any studies, and does not provide any sources for his claim. There haven't been any real studies on breast shape and personality that I could find - which isn't surprising -, but the fact that the article doesn't name the scientists, and also contains already debunked information is a hint at its quality, and the fact that the only scientist - apart from a sexologist who does not name any sources - who seems to support this idea has a lot of other pesudo-sicentific ideas, strongly suggest that this idea is not based on any current scientific evidence.
