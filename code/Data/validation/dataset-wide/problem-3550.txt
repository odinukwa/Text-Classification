Hopefully that helps. And as always, if you suspect your child has any signs or symptoms of tennis elbow please consult a medical professional. 

A pair of shoes off the shelf cannot be "neutral" as the topography of everyone’s foot differs. In addition, the density (hardness) of your shoe insert will vary based on your unique requirements. To attain this neutral position, you must be assessed by a Podiatrist and have a custom orthotic (shoe insert) casted and created. 

Romanian deadlifts and good mornings are both hinge patterns, however there are some major differences. Such as the lever action in relation to where the load is placed. A true good morning is a posteriorly top loaded hip hinge. The difference being the loading vector and range of motion. 

Hormone Release: Decreases Ghrelin: is a fast-acting hormone, when released it play major role in meal initiation. 

Just to clarify one concept, there is no hip extension while doing planks however don’t mistake joint movement with muscle tension (or a muscle contraction). Yes, planks require an isometric contraction of your hips to stabilize yourself. You're generating muscle tension with no movement. This is FINE - every time you walk, sit, stand etc you're contracting your hip flexors - it's unavoidable. 

Bone growth doesn’t stop till about age 20. so you still have some growth yet at age 15. The question is do you want to put these kinds of loads on a skeleton that is not yet mature? Many medical professionals say no, but many strength trainers ignore this advice and start deadlifting and squatting in their teens. No, these lifts will not stunt your growth but injury is a concern in a skeleton that is still growing. 

Creatine supplements can improve your ability to perform brief, intermittant, high intensity exercises. This is specifically useful in weight training and sprint training. By taking creatine supplements you increase your muscles stores of Phosphocreatine (PCr), which is used in the ATP/PC energy pathway (utilized for short bursts of intense activity < 10s). By increasing the stores of PCr you can extend the performance of the ATP/PC system and shorten it's recovery time. While you may see some better performances from the supplementation, it's primarily suited for allowing you to train longer and harder, so the specific training you do is going to be important. If you are talking about repeated sprints that are in excess of 100m you are going to see diminishing returns from supplementation the longer you go. To make improvements in this area you are going to need to do some training that targets the Glycolytic Pathway. If you answer the questions in my comment I can provide a more specific answer about how to train to achieve the outcome. Update: From the sounds of it you need to build your cardio base some more. Without knowing a time frame I can't really make any suggestions. You can continue on with the workouts as you are doing them and why they aren't intended to be cardio workouts they will serve this function until you are able to maintain the effort and stress the anaerobic lactic system. If you have a lot of time it would be much more efficient to follow a periodized training plan that builds a cardio base before moving into phases that focus on lactic and alactic speed. 

This is a very common question - so know you are definitely not alone. There are some easy exercises that you can do to get better at it. A lot of people actually just don’t get onto the ground for fear of getting stuck there. 

Abs exercises don’t remove belly fat The idea that you can remove stubborn body fat from one particular body part could be the most prevalent myth in the fitness industry. Certainly abs belts and abs machines try to promote this idea of “spot reduction”, but doing abs exercise will not burn any more fat off your body. In fact, when someone asks me how to get a six pack, I tell them “don’t do any abs exercises!”. Getting a six-pack requires achieving a low level of body fat that has nothing to do with how many crunches, or abs exercises you do. Your time is much better spent preparing your meals, planning your meals, or focusing on core, compound exercises. Overall, traditional abs exercises like crunches are extremely overrated. 

2.) Standing in a doorway with your palms facing forward with your arms at shoulder level lean forward. 

I'd highly recommend seeing a local Physical Therapist. A full evaluation is required to properly diagnosis and plan a corrective exercise regimen based on your unique situation. I've included information below that provides an overview of typical patterns seen that are similar to what you're describing. 

Day 3 is likely to be a Shoulders & Arms day. Your trainer told you that his plan is going to focus on distinct parts of your body on each day. Day 1 was Legs & Core, Day 2 was Back & Chest so that leaves Shoulders & Arms for Day 3. For exercises you can do: 

This is not how I like to organize a 3 day split workout but it works with what you've done so far. There are still a lot of variables like weight, # of reps, # of sets, rest time, machine vs dumbell vs barbell that are going to be dependent on a lot of factors like your current size, strength and ability. You really should call your trainer because a training plan should be a lot more than just a grouping of exercises. I find it strange that he's done two sessions with you and told you that you have to do a third session but hasn't scheduled it or prepared you for it. I don't want to judge with so little information but you and him need to get on the same page and you may want to shop around a little for a new trainer. 

It depends on what kind of running you are doing. If you are doing a low intensity distance run, no need to do any stretching or warmup. If you are doing a more intense aerobic run you should start with a low intensity warmup run (1/2 mile should be sufficient but ultimately it'll be dictated by your fitness level and the workout you are warning up for). If you are doing high intensity running like max effort sprints you should do an ascending warmup with some dynamic stretching. You should be sweating after this warmup. Save the static stretches for after your run. 

In order to keep your hand parallel to the floor, and modulate the force needed to complete the movement, scapula stabilizers (retractors). Scapula Retractors: 1.) Lower Trapezius 2.) Rhomboids (Major and Minor) 

Symptoms Your child may have pain in the elbow during or after activity without significant swelling or redness. The pain may travel down the forearm. Pain usually begins gradually without one specific injury to the joint. The pain may improve with rest, but often returns when the activity (such as tennis) is resumed. Some individuals notice decreased grip strength on the affected arm. 

Other Lifestyle Changes to Boost HDL Cholesterol The results of this study indicates that exercising at least three to four times per week for at least 20 minutes will help you increase your HDL levels. In fact, increasing the duration of your exercise sessions by pacing yourself (that is, by going slower if necessary) appears to be the best way to translate exercise into higher HDL levels. In addition to exercise, other lifestyle changes can help you increase your HDL level. These include:

Stretch, ice, heat, massage, ibuprofen & light activity There is no real cure for Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) and some of these suggestions are unproven (while some have been proven not to work) there is some science and lots of anecdotal evidence that these things will help. Stretching after your workout is a common practice which has many benefits. Some people report that it helps reduce DOMS but unfortunately the science says that it doesn't really. Heating and icing help facilitate bringing blood into and pushing blood out of the sore area which help recovery. Ice/heat can have a soothing affect too but that depends on the person (personally I hate the feeling of icing). Lightly massaging the sore muscles has also been report to help reduce DOMS but again there is no proof to back it up. I think it feels good though so it may just be psychological. ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory and pain reliever. I think this benefits of this are obvious, but I will say to be careful to understand the health risks as you should do when ingesting any kind of chemical. Doing an Active Recovery (light activity) immediately after your workout will help reduce muscle lactate levels. Continuing to do active recovery activity in the days after your workout is a good way to keep the blood flow going to the sore muscles and prevent the muscles from tightening. 

Push-Ups are Actually Quite Complex There's quite a bit going on during a proper push-up. Just looking at Horizontal Abduction / Adduction at the Shoulder or (GH Joint) is only a tiny piece of the picture. This may sound strange however the push-up technically isn't a beginner exercise. A properly done push-up is much more advanced than most people think. 

Proprioception - which is the awareness of your body's position in space – the mirror will help correct this. Scapula Retractors Strengthening - Rhomboids Major and Lower Trapezius 

From the research I've found: In males -- yes, to an extent, your abdominal muscle fibers (retcus abdominis) can physically grow (called hypertrophy), however the study did not include female participants. As testosterone levels are very low in women and approximately 100 times higher in men. In females I've found no direct evidence supporting abdominal muscle fiber growth (hypertrophy). However, applying physiological and hormonal differences, it's pretty safe to assume abdominal fiber growth would be minimal. 

Then you have the people mistaking chest fat that has accumulated around the lower portion of their chest (creating the "man boobs" appearance no guy wants) for a lagging upper chest. In this case, your chest fat is just making it appear as though your lower chest is big and your upper chest is small by comparison. Building a bigger upper chest isn't the real solution here -- losing body fat is.
