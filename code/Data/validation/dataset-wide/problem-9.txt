The scenario has multiple alien and human factions that are all vying to be top dog. This suggests a given alien or human faction might disguise its AI or FTL technology to resemble that belonging to another faction. Obviously this could be used in covert operations against other factions. Interesting a human faction A could disguise a FTL vessel as a vessel belonging to alien faction X. Its AI would be disguised as an alien faction X AI. Then human faction A could launch an covert operation against human faction B in hope that they will retaliate against alien faction X. This could be further complicated if human faction A constructed an AI that resembled an alien faction Y AI and then disguised it as an alien faction X AI. The attack could be aimed at human faction B. Because this is a multiple layered false flag operation, human faction B could retaliate against either alien faction X or Y. The nature of the FTL travel and the types of AI in your fictional universe will be a major determinant of the kinds of false flag operations that could be undertaken. The most likely form they take is due to the fact that both FTL vessels and AI are artificial constructs that any faction, either alien or human, will be able to duplicate those of other factions. 

For convenience this answer will assume an Earth mass planet. If it has been cracked into several parts by a weapon of mass destruction and those parts moving slowly away from each other, then this suggests something like the following has happened. Whatever the weapon was it has carved the planet into sections and moved those sections apart out to a distance roughly that of the planet's former diameter. Normally that those sections would be expected to fall back together under their mutual gravitation. The fact that they have not suggests the sections of the planet are moving at orbital velocity around the centre of mass of the planet. Even if the planet is in pieces its centre of mass and, naturally, its gravity will remain where it was before the sectioning of the planet. The fragments of the planets are moving at an orbital velocity of about 8 km/s. However, with respect to each other they might only have very small velocity differences. Hence, their slowly floating apart. Digression: the OP suggested the planet's core might have been removed. If this is the case, then what remains of the planet will be less massive than its original condition gravitywise. This also means the orbital velocity of the planet's sections will be correspondingly than 8 km/s. This is something that may need to be factored in later. This indicates the situation of a planet that has been taken apart, those sections of the planet have been accelerated to orbital velocity and they are all moving around what was the planet's former barycentre (its centre of mass & gravity). If the technology exists that take a planet apart, then possibly a different application of the technology might put the planet back together again. This might be safest way of doing it. Otherwise it will be necessary to slow down the pieces of the planet to allow gravity to bring them together. Basically this will involve banging together extremely large lumps of planetary matter. The deceleration of the orbital velocity could involve using solar or magnetic sails, but this will probably take an extremely long time to do so. Many millions of years, at least. Installing rockets in the sections could be used for their deceleration. Preferably, nuclear rockets of some kind, for example, thermonuclear propulsion. Adding gigantic pusher plates to the most stable parts of the sections and detonating nuclear explosive devices would provide nuclear pulse propulsion on the grandest scale possible. Whatever propulsion system was used because of the colossal masses involved it will take an extremely long time to achieve anything. The more the powerful the propulsion system used the more probable is the destruction and disruption of the sections of the planet. The simplest method of bringing together the mass of the planet would be to do destructively. Blasting off large amounts of matter from the sections to collide with the other sections and thereby reduce their overall orbital velocity. If clouds of dust and fragments were orbiting in the opposite direction to the flock of planetary fragments this will gradually decelerate the lot of them. Probably reducing all of the pieces to dust, then gravity would coalesce the dust into a planetary mass again. The original planet will, of course, be totally smashed, but the planet will have reformed. As was said previously, if the super-scientific technology exists to pull a planet apart, then there must exist the super-scientific technology to reassemble it again. Everything else maybe more technically feasible, but it will take too long and be too messy. 

If you consider FTL travel in the light of our current physical knowledge the current set hypothetical methods are: wormholes, Kerr black holes, the Alcubierre warp drive. Krashnikov tubes, and tachyons (definitely not so popular these days). Problems with FTL include causality violation, relativistic mass increase prevents crossing the lightspeed barrier. You can search the tag for FTL on this SE for other information about FTL travel. You will note FTL questions tend to get closed quickly in this neck of the woods. 

This is surprisingly feasible. In a recent paper about alien civilizations building Dyson-rings around pulsars Zaza Osmanov found their habitable range "should be of the order of (10^−4 to 10^−1) AU with temperature interval (300–600) K for relatively slowly rotating pulsars and (10–350) AU with temperature interval (300–700) K for rapidly spinning neutron stars, respectively." Obviously, for the temperature range specified. So, thermal habitability is fine for the parameters of the secondary star and its planets even for rapidly rotating pulsars. Provided the secondary star wasn't in the plane of the emitted radiation and, therefore, subject to the pulsar's pulsing it should be safe in terms of radiation. Since a habitable planet needs a strong geomagnetic field to protect its biosphere from radiation, if the pulsar beam glanced off the planet's magnetic field this produce the most magnificent auroras in the galaxy. Any life evolving on the planets of the secondary star will be adapted for higher levels of radiation than those of most other planets. Somewhat more extremophile, but definitely more radiation adapted. Essentially its not implausible that a habitable planet could in the secondary star's planetary system. The odds against it being a safe place to live long term are high. However, if the conditions are right, then it is possible. This means the distance is great enough and its position relative to the pulsar is out of the path of its radiation beam. 

The concept of creating a nuclear firestorm is an old one. Unfortunately, it's also a thoroughly debunked one. Your attention is directed to this excellent article "(The Impossibility of) Lighting Atmospheric Fire", prepared as coursework by Doowong Chung at Stanford University. To put it bluntly Chung's article details how this fear of nuclear atmospheric ignition has not only kept on recurring, but how has been constantly been debunked. 

Hardly anything. The other answers to this question enthuse about materials and access to space, but the economics is against them all. Even space porn. The reasons couldn't simpler or more cost effective. It would be easier and cheaper to launch robots into space to secure materials and minerals, to make products in micro-gravity, to conduct research in automated laboratories. Ditto space services. Robots would be able to create the technological infrastructure to do all the things listed in the other answers. Maybe not space porn. However, a combination of advanced CGI and rotoscoping would be able to supplant even space porn. Unless there's a global revival of hard-line puritanism, it's doubtful if space porn will be commercially viable, let alone profitable. Squishy, soft organisms like human beings are not space-ready at the best of time. Hard radiation, vacuum, physiological failures due to micro-gravity, and the mass of payload wasted on life-support. The economics of space technology dictate the resources of the solar system will be harvested by corporate and government robots, drones and automata. One-way space migrants paying a reasonable fraction of a megabuck to be shot into the wild black yonder to magically build a space-based civilization in no time at all, why they haven't got a chance of competing. As for winning the race to settle space and make it economically successful, the spacers would be better off if they'd kept their feet securely planted on the surface of the Earth. Where else will be the launch pads and control rooms for the robots actually colonizing space be located? On Earth, of course. Back in the days of yore Jerry Pournelle published an article "Those Pesky Belters and Their Torchships", originally in Galaxy and reprinted in A Step Farther Out (1979), analysing asteroid based civilization. One things came as a surprise when he worked out where was the best place to put the centre of a society of inhabited asteroid settlements. It turned out to be good old planet Earth. Expect the same to be true for any spacer civilization too. Also, expect Elon Branson to be arrested and charged for the scam of defrauding the gullible and space-happy of their millions or parts therefore and subjecting them to the cruel and unusual fate of being shot into space where they have to survive with scant resources. If they do happen to acquire the resources to build their space-based society and its attendant economy, where and how will they get them? From publicly funded space programs naturally. After all, what other institutions have the capacity to do so? 

Use the Yellow Pages. The world is full of mercenary military organizations created by and staffed by ex-military types who want to monetize their skills. Contractors like this are a dime a dozen. However, don't assume they only cost a dime. They don't, expect pay big bucks. Also, there are many major governments that would love to help create your own Foreign Legion. France might see this as a wonderful opportunity to assist with national goals and this might be an ideal way that their resource companies might get a foothold in your nation. As an example Gaddafi's Libya didn't have any difficulty in recruiting mercenaries to fill their armies and especially his corps of bodyguards. Professional mercenaries have no interest in overthrowing their employers. Doing so, only leads to they're not being paid. They're doing this for the money, not to become rulers of countries no matter how resource rich they might be. Try harder. There are heaps of organizations and corporations in the business. Just ask for an expression of interest and advertise for companies to present their proposals for building your Foreign Legion. These days you can practically buy them off the shelf. Time to go shopping. 

Assuming a planetary system with multiple planets in its goldilocks zone, just like TRAPPIST-1, then while is extremely improbable that several sapient species could all make contact with each other effectively simultaneously, it's not impossible. What people often fail to realize is that low probability events happen all the time. Even having an ancient advanced sapient civilization jury rig a planetary system's multiple habitable planets to have sapient species emerge effectively simultaneously would be itself a highly improbable event. Unless the advance ancients are doing this on a regular basis. An alternative solution to sheer improbability becoming a reality and advanced ancients is that a sapient species arises on one of the habitable planets. They expand into interplanetary space, conduct genetic engineering on the native lifeforms, their home planet succumbs to an apocalyptic catastrophe and the colonists return but their civilization regresses into barbarism, all memory of the space-faring phase of their civilization is lost. By the time it re-emerges the other planets have spawned their own civilizations. This is a local uplift scenario involving not quite advanced ancients but then removes them from the scene. 

I suggest doing research into real ecology to understand how genuine, natural ecosystems function. Once you have succeeded with that, consider the impact of only one creature with magical abilities on the ecology. This will be invariably catastrophic. Now devise what magical beast or plant and its abilities is needed to counteract its impact. Keep adding and you will build your own functional magical ecology. This is a step by step method. It will enable you to learn how to construct any sort of ecology, 

All the answers about tracking John by matching visible light optical with thermal or infrared is that the OP mentions "While John is invisible" which suggests he turn his invisibility on and off. If John is smart enough to walk around visible it will be difficult to spot him using comparative imagery. However, government buildings and facilities can be safeguarded against him sneaking in by using a much simpler version of this same technique. Photo-electric beams across doorways and entrances and set up in pairs with one beam visible light and the other infrared. If John blocks the infrared beam but the visible light beam passes right through this can trigger a silent alarm. As for catching him Fiksdal's infiltration of the deep net sounds like the most sensible approach. If he never comes out of his house and abjures society, but he would be dangerous if he did do so. The main problem is that he's an invisible man who, paradoxically, nobody sees. The answers that suggest he can be tracked if any other malefactor are essentially correct. Catch him through his normal needs of supplies and the communications he uses to marshal his agents. It's only the actual laying on of hands to capture him for sure that has problems since he can become invisible. Stun grenades and water colour bombs might do the trick. Disoriented by the stun grenades he might lose his invisibility, but if he was invisible the water colours might soon disappear too if he can ingest apples and have them vanish.
