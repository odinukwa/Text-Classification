Does it mean that purity comes with the consequence of selflessness? That if one is clean and pure they must be selfless? 

Maybe it is for younger people, but what are better ways for adults? What is better for andragogy? Please put your answer in question form if you are a die hard. 

Or a link to somewhere that does. An audio recording of the orthoepy is ideal. I came to Kierkegaard, and don't trust youtube. Videolectures.net was searched; no results. How does one say other major philosophers such as Nietzsche, Kant...etc? 

John Rawls and Robert Nozick may be an option. Although, they are political philosophers. This question relates to liberty vs equality. Here are some relevant links, unrelated to above: 

Although I'm a linguist, I'm going to not give a report on the sociology of the term as used in the field (though the quick answer is "yes"). Instead, I will focus on the basic conceptual distinctions. The term "language" refers to the numerous methods of encoding propositions and communicating, which humans use -- examples are Greek, English, Swahili, Chinese. However, in the modern era, the concept has been extended metaphorically so that we now hear about "the language of dance" or "the language of bees", and in the aforementioned instance, "the language of computers". It is not clear what "language" refers to in the modern extended sense -- it seems to refer to any regular pattern, and DNA encoding can be seen to be a "kind of language". The term "natural language" then is used to specifically identify "language" in the classical sense. However, we rarely use that expression, since we consider the extension of the term "language" to other forms of animal behavior, or complex physical systems like DNA, to be misuse of the term "language". Since the term "language" clearly refers to human language, we don't need to add any modifiers. But it may be necessary when in a popular forum. (It has also become necessary in computational linguistics, in the field "natural language programming", precisely because "programming language" is a standard term in that field). That said, one of the top journals in the field is in fact named Natural Language and Linguistic Theory. 

Short answer, no. First of all, I would distinguish at least three parts: the interpretation of color by the brain, how can we assign a color to light and how that light is emmited by objects. I'll briefly comment the first one and concentrate on the rest. Color interpretation clearly depends on the observer: I don't even know whether we see the same colors, some animals have more primary colors and other spectrum range, etc. The rest of the answers explain this quite well. Let's go to the physical aspects and some common misconceptions: 

"Natural rights" refer to the right to do (and it is by the nature of being human that humans have rights, which is how "human rights" and "natural rights" get equated). "Human rights" as used in the OPs reference and in most current usages include various rights to have, which is how people can now speak of a right to be provided an education, be provided with potable water, and whatever else you may have encountered. 

Knowing or not knowing the consequences of an act is essential to evaluating the morality of a choice. Take one of those contrived examples where some evil genius has rigged explosives to a light switch such that when Mrs. Smith turns on the light, the victim is blown to smithereens. If Mrs. Smith knows of the consequences of turning on the light, and assuming there isn't some countervailing life-or-death paradox involved, then the moral choice is to choose not to turn on the light. If Mrs. Smith has no knowledge of this arrangement, the moral choice is to turn on the light (rather than curse the darkness). In the former case, she is choosing to both turn on the light and to kill the victim (the latter being the immoral choice), but in the latter case she is not choosing to kill, though that does turn out to be an unforseeable consequence of the action. The operative principle is that choosing to kill an innocent person is immoral; not all choices constitute "choosing to kill". Your two examples have in common killing, but that is not the only domain of moral evaluation. To see whether there is a general principle (i.e. are we just dealing with a viceral reaction against death, are you getting bogged down in death penalty morality or meat-eating), you should look for a less extreme scenario. The proper moral question to ask is whether it is morally justified to choose to execute a person for theft, per se. If it is not, then doing it yourself versus commissioning someone else to do it for you does not change the picture, and it is even less relevant whether you implement the execution yourself. 

Have you read Stay: A History of Suicide and the Philosophies Against It? Personally, I justify (or maybe I am rationalizing) to continue living though the deontology branch. This comes from Peter Singer's (preference utilitarian) Effective Altruism and what Thomas Pogge (a political philosopher) describes as the negative duty. 

Preface This is not an attempt to appeal to tradition. Rather, the purpose of this question can be attached with these words: general + curiosity. [If you feel that this question should be moved to a different SE site, please move it. I don't know how.] Brass Tacks What list like ethical code of ancient religions is similar to the Ten Commandments or the five/ eight precepts of Buddhism? Not for the content of the list; for the [simplicity/ conventionality--please help with the diction here]. Additionally, the difference between law and 'ethical code' lies in how each are followed (generally speaking). For example, the Code of Hammurabi is more of law. Laws are generally imposed, while ethics is more or less up the the individual. [Also, I think the tags need improvement or change.] 

Your three examples are not observations in the primary sense, they are conclusions. "All objects fall to the ground" is a conclusion about all past and future states of affairs of a particular type, and most of those events have not been observed. An observation would be e.g. "This brick fell to the ground when I released it 5 minutes ago". Some observations are clearly theory-laden, such as any measurement of temperature, pressure and acceleration. Other observations are not actually theory laden, but are standard-laden (such as measurement of distance with a ruler). There is a lot of confusion out there over the distinction between "observation" and "conclusion". An "observation" is a simple perceptual act. You can legitimately observe an object falling to the ground, but when you observe that at time T1 an object is on the table and at time T2 it is on the ground, you cannot claim to have "observed" the object falling. The statement that "everything one observes is interpreted through a prior understanding of other theories and concepts" is true by dint of the meaning of "interpret" and the nature of "concepts" (we need not even invoke "theories"). To say that a perceptual fact is "interpreted" (e.g. when you "interpret" what happens in your brain's data-processing centers as you see me let go of a brick) is to relate the sensations that strike your mind to other, similar sensations. Perceiving that there is a brick depends on there existing (and you knowing) a concept "brick". Suppose there were a being that had no concepts at all (such as an earthworm). What would it mean for an earthworm to "interpret" an observation? 

I cannot find a reliable example of either. I really just want a practical everyday example of the choice of a preference utilitarian. Do preferences have weight? Is there some sort of "preference calculus"? For example, a son lying to his mother--wouldn't each preference cancel out? "[I]f we still need to compare the strength of different people’s preferences." Utilitarianism: objections If all else fails, what is a good resource that may provide examples? I'm fairly certain Practical Ethics by Peter Singer does not have the kind of examples I'm looking for. Perhaps preference utilitarianism is not meant for the micro-scale. Or rather, it is meant to be paired with deontology (in a two-tiered system) as espoused by Singer and Hare anyway: "as a moral philosopher, I am pretty confident that the best ethical theory is a combination of Kantianism with utilitarianism." (Hare 1993) 

That would depend on your ethical principles. Some people have no objections to theft of physical property; there are those who have no truck with the concept of intellectual property (so it would be wrong to take an artist's physical painting, but okay to make a copy). I assume you generally accept the general moral principle that a person owns the intellectual "content" that he creates and this has the same property rights as he would have to his vegetables and house. Moral philosophy also admits "exceptions", for example killing a person is immoral, but there are contexts where it is not -- for instance, if the person is attempting to kill you, then you may kill him if it is necessary to preserve your life. Such an "exception" follow, at least in an egoist framework, from the purpose of a moral code which is to prescribe how to live your life – being killed obviously contradicts that purpose. So: what could possibly justify an exception for the purpose of understanding the fuss? Well, it would be something like, "The wish to understand a popular internet trend justifies ignoring the property rights of others". But this is obviously not a general principle, it's a post-hoc rationalization. I can't conceive of any reasonable principle that would lead to such an exception. 

That world exists, it's ours. Firstly, I haven't found any definition of primary and secondary attributes. I'll suppose that a secondary attribute can vary while the object doesn't and primary attributes do modify the object. But I see some misconceptions, in Special Relativity heating the cabbage will increase its mass (if you suppose that there is not loss of atoms). The other problem is that when you see an object through a glass, you're modifying how you see its color. So it should be compared to measuring the object's weight while you are pushing the scale, its mass (color) remains the same but not what you measure (see). It's mostly a matter of semantics. Why do you say it's a cabbage, since it's chemical composition has changed? If you try to find some primary attributes I think that they should be in elementary particles. But if String Theory is correct, then they would just depend on the string's frecuency. So I think it's quite difficult to distinguish between primary and secondary attributes (at least with the examples you gave).
