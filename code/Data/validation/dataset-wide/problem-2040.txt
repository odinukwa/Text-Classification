I've had the best results so far with personal recommendations, both for being referred and looking for people with a completely different skill focus than mine (thing backend programming and field sales). If you know great systems/networking engineers, ask them for a recommendation or five. Most good people always know one or two other good guys who are open to a new job. And if you tell your friend what issues you are facing they might also give you a hint as to what skills or certifications to look for. I even offered to screen and interview candidates for a friend, so that is a thing. 

It may look like it, but don't treat this like a monologue. Listen to the other person, too. There may be something going on, you're not aware of. 

This is equal to "I found out that I'm not able to do this" or "I'm not able to do this" if it's something discussed before. Again, it has nothing to do with being disabled in particular. Everybody can find out that they're not able to do something - even after they've been assigned the task. The professional way of dealing with these issues towards a disabled person is to be aware that these issues are relevant regardless of disabilities and deal with them as one would towards a not-disabled person. What ever that means for the particular company and it's culture. Addendum: So how to address topics like this with team members? The most imporant thing is to praise in public and criticize in private. 

Well I really messed up: A small batch of custom resumes were perfect and typo free, however, they were not converted to PDF correctly and as a result there was additional personal information from another document included at the bottom of the resume. The mistake is obvious and will most likely result in receiving no call backs from these employers; this field is unforgiving of these types of errors that scream incompetence. My question is that while there is nothing I can do to correct the mistake and become a "serious candidate", I would like to at least get the sloppy resume updated in their database, so as to remove the personal information as well as hopefully prevent it from being seen in the future, in case I have later dealings with these companies. Is a short letter saying "I made a mistake and would appreciate it if they could replace the faulty resume with the correct one" appropriate or understandbale? Please note that these resumes were emailed, not uploaded into a web-based database (otherwise I would just update it myself). Will an HR Manager even do this? Anything else to add in order to soften the blow... like a note taking responsibility for the mistake and an apology for the inconvenience? 

Your CV is there to sell yourself. Its not desperate to display your skills. The whole point of the document is to display your experience and capabilities and get your foot in the door for an interview. Glorify yourself as much as you can. 

If you've already had two counter offers given to you and accepted, I'd be very surprised if they were willing to give you a raise unless it was justified. 

I've very recently found a new job in in England from Japan. Realistically, a time frame just isn't possible. This entirely depends on your abilities, experience and ultimately showing you're a good fit for the company. I was very fortunate in my find. Just show commitment as well as showing you're capable of doing the job. To give some insight, it took me a month, but in this time I sent my CV to 100+ agencies and companies, had 7+ interviews and for the job I got, had to fly to England for 1 day to spend with the company (from Japan, which wasn't fun). I also had endless calls from 3rd parties that got me a couple of extra interviews. I was also working my current job during all of this. From an industry perspective, Front-end developers have it really tough. You have to have a shiny portfolio, Github activity, all sorts just to get your foot in the door for an interview. Finding a role Front-end development overseas especially entry-level is a ball busting exercise. With 2-years experience, unless you have exceptional abilities, try to look at entry-level stuff and make sure you have a very nice portfolio to show off. 

Is it appropriate to bring a copy of the APIs for languages listed on your resume, in anticipation of technical / coding / whiteboard questions? This could be perceived as either ignorance or preparedness (and an awareness for the situation). This would be difficult with with a hardcopy, but feasible with a phone or small tablet, especially if they are made available offline. Obviously, if the interviewer wants to test memorized knowledge, they can ask (or you can offer) to perform the task without it. For Non-Programmers: API stands for Application Programming Interface and is used by programmers to interact with common functions made available by a programming language. 

The price of rent in the area of a potential employer has increased dramatically without regard to the rest of the state and surrounding areas outside reasonable driving distance. In fact, it appears the trend will continue and I will be looking at an entirely different situation in as little as 1-2 years. Is it appropriate to mention this noticeable trend during salary negotiations, and how they dealt with this situation in order to continue competing for talent? Surely, they want to keep a happy employee that is focused on their work instead of rent. *From my initial research, there has not been an increase in salaries for this area when compared to others outside. **Assume that relocation to the area will be necessary, and commuting is not an option. UPDATE: In response to the answers bearing similarities to the answers in this question, I am not asking a company to accommodate my personal needs regardless of the market rate for the local area. I am well aware that my value is the basis for their salary offer. What I am asking about is referencing an anomalous situation which has been reported by local newspapers. 

Is there a genuine benefit to using ECMAscript 6 over 5 in the applications you're building? Does this benefit actually bring any real cost-benefit/time-benefit over continuing to use ECMAscript 5? From your colleagues perspective, there needs to be a good reason to do this. If you're working in a team, its very likely not everyone is familiar with the latest version of ECMAscript. Is it really worth expecting everyone to know the new features of this version without having any real added benefit? I honestly don't think so. My suggestion would be to give your colleague evidence that this will improve your product. These improvements needs to be significant enough that they are a real benefit and not just saving a line of code in your application. 

You recognise you're already being paid above the standard rate very handsomely, I doubt a reasonable justification could be given for a further raise. In addition to this, you've been counter offered twice. There's a risk in asking for a raise before an annual review, they might see this as taking them for a ride and subsequently start looking for your replacement. I'd recommend waiting until the topic is opened in an annual review of some kind. Otherwise, look for the higher paying job and go to it. I wouldn't recommend accepting a third counter offer, if you do, expect to be out of the job within 2 years and keep that CV updated. 

Finances/Tuition/Living Expenses aside, for the reasons stated above, would it be wise to delay graduating in order to work for an extra semester? Will this experience allow one to apply after graduation as a "Level I" candidate instead of "Entry Level", thereby significantly raising their salary? 

I had always planned on focusing on my studies until senior year and obtaining at least one year of work experience in my field before graduating to set me apart. Due to a number of factors, I am now ready to graduate but have not yet had employment in my field; this is due to outside matters and not inability to find work. I believe it is in my best interest to begin working before graduation, because companies may more readily hire cheaper workers and I may be allowed a more pleasant learning curve as I start out. I do not want to enter the workforce full time and be let go because I didn't judge my capabilities correctly. As a graduate I will also be competing for larger salary numbers against others who will most likely have this industry experience.
