The order of the garter was "Restored to gift of the Sovereign by Attlee in 1946". So maybe he wouldn't accept it from the Labour prime minister but would accept it from the monarch. I personally think 'sour grapes, dissipating' is the explanation, it fits with his personality, which seems a bit tempestuous. And he did change party (or "Cross the Floor") twice, so perhaps he was open to changing his mind from time to time. 

San Marino had given a safe haven to key figures in the Italian unification movement, including Garibaldi, and apparently that's why San Marino’s desire for independence was respected. more info The link also talks about the recognition of san marino by the Kingdom of Italy in 1862. I don't know why they did not want to unify and why the new Italian state wasn't that bothered. But it might because of san marino's remote location in the Apennines. Support from France seem to have kept san marino safe from the papal states and Austria during the period, so it seems likely this safeguarded their independence from the kingdom of Italy as well. 

You might like one of my local fortifications (The Portsmouth area is a fortification rich area with forts/castles dating from the 3rd to the 19th and probably 20th Century, all worth a look), Porchester castle is built on the remains of a Roman Fort of the Saxon Shore, with large parts of the Roman fortifications (including D shaped bastions) incorporated into the curtain wall. 

As observed elsewhere cutlasses remained in use as boarding weapons on warships until the mid 20th century at least. One documented (aleged) instance of their use was the capture of cruiser RN Pola by the destroyer HMS Jervis at the Battle of Matapan (March 1941): From Clash of Titans by Walter J Boyne:

Possibly they wanted to match it to Brumalia. The Roman winter solstice festival. wikipedia: "The Brumalia was also celebrated during the space of thirty days, commencing on 24 November and ending with the "Waxing of the Light", December 25" citation Much the same can be said about Saturnalia, they're very similar. The "Birthday of the Unconquered Sun" is another Decemeber 25th shortest day thing, but it's usage seems to be late roman empire. The tropical year is the solar year. It's a measurement of the position of the sun. It was probably based on Hipparchus's work on equinoxes. Also the choice of this date is to do with Pliny: $URL$ 

Philo of Byzantium, wrote Pneumatica. Which included details of devices operated by air pressure. They knew about it far earlier than newton. He seems to be an early source for knowing about the properties of air with respect to combustion, link. But if we're talking about classical Greek elements, I thought Empedocles's four elements included air. However it is "wind" in the Babylonian idea from the Enûma Eliš (18th-16th century BCE). I'm not sure what the difference between air and wind is unfortunately, and I don't have access to papers anymore. This is what I would read if I did: $URL$ 

Alleged is attached to this report as officially cutlasses were withdrawn from the ships of the Royal Navy in 1936. However in addition to the above incident we have the alleged use of cutlasses when HMS Cossack captured the Altmark in 1940, which is often described as the last use of the cutlass in anger by the RN. 

From this drawing we can take measurements, which gives the height of the rangefinder above the fire control top on the foremast is about 28m above the top edge of the boot topping (the black band around the hull approximately where the waterline would be). So the height above the water line in combat should have been within a meter or so of 28m. This would put the geometric horizon at about 19+ km (~21 kyd). So the maximum range at which an opponent could be seen by the range finder would be maybe something like 35 km (~ 38 kyd). But this is academic for Jutland as visibility was constrained by the weather conditions and the smoke not by the geometric horizon. (also note the refraction will result in the horizon generally being further away than the geometrical horizon) Added for information, the longest range hit by one underway warship on another is a toss up between Warspite's hit on Guilio Cesare during the Action off Calabria (the battle of Punta Stilo) July 1940 at ~26 kyds, and Scharnhorst on Glorious in June 1940 at about 26.2-26.5 kyds. The uncertainties in the figures make it difficult to say that the latter was definitely at a longer range than the former. 

Probably for "Field Carrier Landing Practice". Here is a modern example Of course it's a "probably", I can't find a decent source for this in particular. I imagine they would have stored chocks, arrestor wires in there but I can't find a source. Another image link ,Different Picture 

The German and Austrian Jewish population was about 750,000, of which three quarters were exterminated. Whereas the total German population was about 70 million. But 1941, when the extermination program began the number of Jewish forced labourers in German was 60,000, compared to the 2,000,000 foreign labourers (Fremdarbeiter) [source]. The Nazis decided that this was not an economic impediment to the Holocaust. Furthermore, in regions where the sudden absence of Jewish Labour would have been a problem they delayed the process to allow for their replacement. It seems logical that the movement from forced labour to Extermination through Labour and the Holocaust of the Jewish population would have lead to costs (from the inefficiency of moving skilled workers to hard labour, to the expenses of diverting effort to commit to commit these awful crimes). These must have been the disruptions the Nazis had in mind and saw as no economic reason not to proceed. I will say the Jews brought from conquered lands for forced labour probably would have been an overall benefit to the German war effort, but I'm not including that as the "holocaust" as I'm assuming the alternative the questioner has in mind is assigning these foreign Jews to the Fremdarbeiter system anyway. So no, it wasn't a massive strategic mistake. I've not considered other angles, like it's effect on their nuclear program, but in raw economic terms the Nazi's don't seem to have been punished for their terrible crimes. So, to conclude, Holocaust, whilst being one of the most horrendous crimes against humanity in history, wasn't as economically significant as OP may have suspected.

Due to the low surfaced speed and even more limited speed/endurance submerged, in order for pre-modern submarines to take part in a fleet action they need to be pre-positioned on patrol lines, choke points etc likely to intercept the opposing fleet. This was Japanese doctrine for a major fleet action. In the case of the Philippine Sea the US being on the offensive and with superior intelligence resources could preposition its submarines for the battle. The Japanese in contrast being on the defensive and having inferior intelligence (not knowing where or when the blow would fall) could not achieve this to the same extent - if at all. This is additional to the technological inferiority in virtually every aspect of equipment and resources for both pro and anti-submarine operations by 1944, except possibly for torpedoes. 

Here is some info on travel restrictions in a very specific period. During the 1948–1959 All-Palestine Government Period (a puppet state of Egypt controlling Gaza) 14,000 All-Palestine passports were issued, mostly to Gazan notables and businessmen, with any Palestinians being eligible (including residents of the Jordanian controlled West Bank). It's hard to say what percentage of the population this was. 1945 figures show 32,250, but this was before the Nakba and the next figure is 100,272 in 1982. Ahmed Mu-awad, writing in Sarakha Illah al-Sama [Cry to Heaven] states: "Among the tens of passports that I checked, I foud many with entrance permits to Egypt, and a few with Saudi Arabian permits" This suggests that entrance to Egypt did not come with this passport, but was often granted by the Egyptian government. The book goes onto state that the passport was not recognised elsewhere. So it would seem that the main function of this passport was admittance to Egypt. 

Probably French line infantry of the period, in which case 113 is the regiment number. Attached a couple of illustrations of Franco-Prussian War period line uniforms. 

Plato:Republic ~220,000 words (in translation), Symposium ~25,000 words (in translation) Aristotle: Poetics ~20,000 words (in translation), Physics ~85,000 words (in translation) It is fairly easy to find the word counts for English translations of surviving works 

The Mayflower was a small-ish merchant ship (Dutch Fluyt) of the early 17th Century ~100 tons burden. With a crew of ~25-30 men and boys. Also all the models/diagrams seem to show stairs from the half deck to the upper deck and to the deck below that above the hold (and maybe down to the orlop deck or hold ) 

The production rate could have been about three a month according to the transcript of the telephone conversation between Gen Hull and Col Seeman on the Nuclear Secrecy Blog 

Not slaves, or jews come to think of it. This Discovery Link had some info from archaeology about who built the pyramids. This pretty much sums it up "the pyramids were built by skilled workers and bureaucrats (who lived there all year long) and farmers (who provided seasonal labour during the inundation when they could not work on their farms)". Intrestingly enough this pretty in depth BBC link is the first result for "pyramids paid in beer" (read: subsistence rations). It contains a summary of archaeological evidence about both the permanent and much larger temporary (seasonal) workforce. 

I take it you mean why was there no "Scramble for China" in the 19th century. Excluding Hong Kong, ceded to Britain after the First Opium War. The Second Sino-Japanese War makes an excellent case study of the problems of invading China. In 1937 China had a completely out of date military and an ineffective industrial base, and was fighting a civil war. Japan was clearly militarily far superior. After a series of defeats at the hands of the Japanese, Chinese forces adopted a Guerrilla strategy of attrition and through constant harassment denied the Japanese a decisive victory. Bernard Montgomery, later compared such a war with an invasion of Russia: Rule 1, on page 1 of the book of war, is: "Do not march on Moscow". Various people have tried it, Napoleon and Hitler, and it is no good. That is the first rule. I do not know whether your Lordships will know Rule 2 of war. It is: "Do not go fighting with your land armies in China". It is a vast country, with no clearly defined objectives. The comparisons between the failure of operation Barbarossa and attempts to conquer china are evident. This sort of war would have been highly undesirable for a European power in the 19th Century. Their military superiority over the outdated Qing armies would not guarantee victory and any war would likely be a drawn out costly one. Undeniably, for organisations such as the British East India Company (who had been so keen on conquering India for profit) this would have made terrible business sense. Much better to extract trade and diplomatic concessions as the British did during the Opium Wars 

The initial British/French mining in the channel was as an anti-submarine barrage. Later anti-invasion fields were laid. Later in the war offensive fields were laid on the other side of the channel. Details of RN mine laying in WW2 may be found here 

One of the better known examples is the late 15th century equestrian armour A21 in the Wallace Collection in London. There is a paper on this armour (ref.1). 

After some more research I stand by my earlier comment in general the gun ports had minimal protection, relying on small size and being in the shadow of the gun. There is a large amount of negative evidence for this, for example in his books Warrior to Dreadnought, The Grand Fleet and Nelson to Vanguard D. K. Brown does not mention protection to turret gun ports. The positive evidence I cite the cross section of a 14" three gun turret on Eugene Solver's US Navy pages which shows no protection to the gun port. From the same site we have access to OP 769 Configuration of the Three Gun Turrets of the USS New Jersey which explains that there are upper and lower shield plates on the gun slide. These do not seal the gun port and at best provide protection from 6" projectiles and splinters. The arragements are shown in the accompanying illustration, from which their thickness can be measured which when compared to the face plate thickness is equivalent to about 3" thick. The relevant section of this document is shown below: 

Baltic fleet The fast German advance up the Baltic coast pushed the Soviet fleet back to bases in the gulf of Finland (Leningrad and Kronstadt). From here their operations were severely limited by German and Finnish mines. See the wikipedia page. Here is a description of mine-laying activity in gratuitous detail. Mine were layed by Germany, their co-belligerent Finland as well as Sweden. The Baltic fleet did participate in the Siege of Leningrad, but it looks like their main contribution was in aviation. The Russian submarines in the Baltic appear to have been disruptive, but weren't very effective and did not present a substantial threat. Black Sea Mostly inaccessible to the Germans. As with the Baltic, their western bases were quickly taken by German land force. The Russian navy had a huge surface fleet advantage, against the Romanian and Bulgarian navies, but this was completely nullified by German air superiority. In this case the German land advance took all major Soviet shipyards, leaving the fleet based in Georgia with inadequate repair facilities, hindering their operational capabilities. They were able to give some support to, and helped to evacuate, coastal cities. Other The Northern fleet was involved in protexting the Arctic Convoys, and supplied naval infantry forces to the Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive against German forces in northern Finland and Norway. The Pacific fleet participated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The Caspian Flotilla was involved in supplying Stalingrad (via the Volga, which flows into the Caspian) as well as supplying other fighting in the Caucasuses.
