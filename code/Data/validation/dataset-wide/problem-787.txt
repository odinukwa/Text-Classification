Yes, after a close encounter with other planets, almost anything can happen, including a split of Mercury into smaller bodies by tidal forces, or capturing as one or more moons of one or more planets, or a sequence of captures by, and escapes from planets, conversion to a ring of all or some of the fragments, collisions with other moons, fragments falling into the Sun, others ejected from the solar system. 

The infalling matter, mostly dust and gas, but also stars, is accelerated to nearly the speed of light. That's a giant amount of energy. Part of it is emitted as electromagnetic radiation. The other factor is surrounding dust. If all this happens in a dense cloud of dust, you don't see it well from out outside. Next: Are you sure, other supermassive black holes don't show similar features? Quasars near the edge of the visible universe are visible, since their respective jet points towards us. 

Suppose in a binary stars system there is a dying star and a companion black hole as they orbit around each other. My question is what will possibly happen to the black hole if the partner goes supernova? I understand that the kinetic energy from the supernova cannot destroy the black hole. 

Hypothetical question: when a pair of identical stellar black holes are very close to one another wouldn't the side facing each other experience lower gravitational force? How is this logic un/sound? 

Since there are a lot of stellar black holes estimate to be around 100 millions alone in our milky way galaxy, maybe this facts might help explain the missing dark matter and I'll go even further... the energy produced by the collapsing stars and colliding black holes might be whats driving the expansion of space to speed up! otherwise why wouldn't it be? 

Those are model calculations, which hint to the existence of a possible body of about 10-times the mass of Earth. Calling this a discovery would clearly be premature. The confidence level is just a little above the "evidence" level of 3 sigma, under the assumption, that the discoveries of the KBO objects leading to the inference aren't observationally biased. It's a long way to direct observation, since precise orbital data haven't been inferred. Another option is, that there has been a planet. But it might have left our Solar system. Hence predicting a date for direct observation doesn't appear reasonable at the moment. 

The probabilites are unknown at the moment (March 2014), since there is only one known planet (Earth) harboring life. This doesn't allow any meaningful probability estimates for the occurence of life, based on empirical data. The overall formation of life is too complex to allow simulations based on current technology. Although some intermediate steps can be simulated or performed by experiment, e.g. by the Miller-Urey experiment. The Drake equation is a simplified attempt to decompose the probability into factors. Some of the factors aren't known yet. But there has been much progress in estimating the frequency of exoplanets, and the probability of planets to be habitable. From this news release one could estimate (order of magnitude), that there is one habitable planet around a Sun-like star per about 1,700 (about 12³) cubic light years in our region of the Milky Way ("... the nearest sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away..."). We don't know the probability for habitable planets to develop life, nor to be colonized. Probabilities of complex life forms are even more difficult to estimate (yet). More discussion about habitability of exoplanets on Wikipedia. 

Is there any naturally occurring event powerful enough that can cause a galaxy regardless of shape and size to divide itself into two or more smaller galaxies? 

Almost all gas giants in our solar system are observed to have a planetary ring comprises of ice, dust and rocks. My question is do these rings obediently sticks around their foster parent until our starving Sun becomes red giant? Also why don't the ring forms into moon? 

Is Corona Mass Ejection able to reach the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn? If so can it blows away the icy rings or the distance is simply beyond the reach of maybe like Earth it is protected by a magnetic field? 

We don't know it, because the question isn't feasible thus far to experiments or observation. But it's possible to develop theories far beyond our observable universe, even far beyond the multiverse theories described here in Wikipedia. There exist theories about a tranfinite hierachy of meta-levels of theories in mathematical physics, each level comprising all possible theories on the level below (beyond any notion of infinity) and all their interconnections (including hierarchies of interconnections between interconnections). To explain this in reasonable detail would need hundreds of mind-boggling pages, at least. So I won't even try to explain more details. At the end it's not even clear, whether there is a difference between mathematics (including a transfinite number of meta-levels) and physics (including a transfinite number meta-levels). The anthropic principle tries to answer the follow-up question "Why do we live in exactly this universe with exactly these laws of nature?". But this kind of answer isn't satisfying from a scientific point of view, when looking for cause and effect. If you're looking for a final answer comprising everything: There is no, because the notion "everything" leads to paradoxa, when used in an absolute sense. (See Gödel's incompleteness theorems, if you need more details.) 

I read that after LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected gravitational waves signal from a kilonova, many ground based telescopes quickly turns their mirrors towards the spot and "sees" gold and platinum ,etc other heavy elements over the next few days. Is it really possible to directly observe heavy elements being formed consider that the event occurs at a distance of around 130 millions light year away? 

I am wondering since neutron star is smaller than the average main-sequence stars and it doesn't produce energy via fusion so why do we still call it a star? 

If primordial black hole do exists today could it be responsible for galaxies maybe even quasars, I mean these ancient monsters gobble up all materials in its wake and grow bigger and eventually evolves into say milky way galaxy etc. What are the odds of such events actually happened? 

B-modes in the raw CMB data can be caused by primordial gravitational waves, as well as by cosmic dust. After subtracting the cosmic dust polarization from the BCEP2 data, the residual signal is too weak with respect to noise to be statistically sufficiently significant to claim a discovery. Or stated in a different way: The observed B-modes can be explained away by cosmic dust. This doesn't prove the absence of primordial gravitational waves. But it doesn't provide sufficient evidence for their presence either. 

Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability. The stability is caused by the hydrostatic equilibrium between gas/plasma pressure and gravity. The pressure is mainly caused by the heat of several millions degrees. More details here. 

I read that Dragonfly44 is a galaxy mostly consists of dark matter, and it should contain a super massive black hole too. If there really is a dark SMBH, how does it lose mass? I think there is no way for dark matter to be converted into energy and vice versa, no? 

An annular eclipse is similar to total eclipse except our Moon "apparently" appears smaller than the Sun, my question is since in both cases there will be a glowing ring forming... so how to tell them apart? 

Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy in the galaxy cluster[1] called Local Group[2] and our Milky Way Galaxy as well as some satellite/dwarf galaxies are orbiting around each other within Local Group. My question isn't Milky Way Galaxy supposed to orbit around Andromeda Galaxy[3] so how come the predicted merger[4]? Whose slowing down or do the gravity work differently as things are being scaled further up? 

The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is probably the closest we can get to your question. $$ r_s = (2G/c^2) \cdot m \mbox{, with }\ 2G/c^2 = 2.95\ \mbox{km}/\mbox{solar mass}. $$ This means, that the Schwarzschild radius for a given mass is proportional to that mass. The radius shouldn't be taken too literal in the physical sense, because space is highly non-euclidean close to a black hole. Present (light-travel) radius of the visible universe, as seen from the earth: $$13.81 \cdot 10^9\ \mbox{lightyears} = 13.81 \cdot 10^9 * 9.4607 * 10^{12}\ \mbox{km} = 1.3065\cdot 10^{23}\ \mbox{km}.$$ So we need $$1.3065\cdot 10^{23}\ \mbox{km} / 2.95\ \mbox{km} =4.429 \cdot 10^{22}$$ solar masses to get a black hole of the light-travel Schwarzschild radius of the visible universe, pretty close (by order of magnitude) to the number of stars estimated for the visible universe. The Wikipedia author(s) gets a similar result: "The observable universe's mass has a Schwarzschild radius of approximately 10 billion light years". 

I know that virtual particles are constantly be created and annihilated even in a complete vacuum, I like to know if there exist such a mechanism to spawn an anti-particle black hole can be any size not necessary stellar? I think black hole lose mass by gradually throwing out one of the pair of virtual particles before they could cancel out each other, so would this also apply to an anti-particle black hole as well if it does exists? 

Just because we observed that our milky way galaxy is spinning in a certain direction therefore we assume it is applicable to all other galaxies, I am curious to find out if hypothetically most of the celestial objects such as natural satellites, planets, stars even galaxies within our observable universe are spinning/rotating in the same direction as the milky way what kind of implications can we say about the condition in the early universe? or is it just an coincident? 

Another "mega project" currently starting to produce data is the Gaia project: "By the end of the mission, the data archive will exceed 1 Petabyte (1 million Gigabytes)". They intend to "measure the positions and velocity of approximately one billion stars in our Galaxy". "Gaia will carry the largest digital camera into space with nearly one billion pixels." A Petabyte is about 1e15 bytes (1000 Terabytes). 

Big Bang theory is rather adequate, with respect to observations. But it's incomplete. Your question is about the pre-planck epoch, a state of the universe, when space and time didn't exist in a way we are used to in standard physics. Nothing is really known (by empirical evidence) about this state, although there are theoretical approches (e.g. this one), which try to describe even those highly non-local and non-causal structures, from which "eventually" the Planck epoch could emerge. The Planck epoch, lasting from zero to about $10^{-43}\mbox{ s}$, the Planck time, is still far from being understood, since the energy needed to fully investigate this state of the universe is far beyond accessible to experiments. We just know, that neither general relativity nor quantum theory describe this state correctly. Research about quantum gravity tries to fill this gap. You may think of the pre-Planck and the Planck epoch as a state of the universe, which is dominated by quantum fluctuations. They don't need a reason or a cause to occur. They are a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. As an example, if you try to measure time with very high precision, you'll get an increasing uncertainty in the energy measurement of the observed particle (time-energy-uncertainty). Within the very short Planck epoch, high energy fluctuations needed to occur, since both values (time and energy) cannot be pinned down together. The reason for the Big Bang is thought to be such a kind of quantum fluctuations, yet not understood in very detail. Questions like where?, when?, and why? don't apply in the intuitive sense to quantum phenomena. It's more a matter of probabilities, waves, and relations between observable values, without the observable values themselves being defined independently.
