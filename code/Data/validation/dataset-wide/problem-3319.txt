The definition of a morpheme is that it is the smallest meaningful unit of language. Morphemes do constitute words but they also include root words. Therefore there's no point in trying to enumerate them in a single language let alone across languages. You could enumerate things like inflectional or derivational morphemes which would are always very limited inventories but that would not really help you. The point of the double articulation thesis is that you have a system of articulation meaning (morphemes, words, sentences, texts) that is built upon a system of articulation without meaning (phonemes, syllables, etc.). It is not intended to support a separate thesis about the productivity of language associated with Chomsky. The thing to remember is that although strictly speaking morphemes are built out of phonemes, phonemes actually don't combine into morphemes. They combine into syllables which do not have a straightforward relationship with morphemes (a morpheme can consist of two syllables, e.g. 'simple' but one syllable can also represent two morphemes, e.g. 'runs'). Syllables then combine into metric/intonational units which again do not always map straightforwardly onto words, phrases, clauses and sentences. 

Surface expression basically means the form you see. It is the result of applying a rule to some (hypothetical) underlying form of a word (or phrase). So the deep structure would be something like 'dog+plural' and the surface form of that would be 'dogs' or 'I+direct object' and 'me'. It is largely used in generative contexts and even then only historically since the original deep vs. surface structure distinction has been mostly abandoned. It can be a useful shortcut when talking about the results of rules but few people believe that there is actually any such thing as deep structure. 

There are many situations, in which an L1 speakers may find it easier to communicate about certain areas in L2. They will have the right vocabulary but also know the right ways of formulating their thoughts. There are cases of variable regression so a speaker will loose some of their L1 and L2 will become their main language. This is often seen in emigres. It is possible even for people with severely impaired L1 to acquire L2 in many contexts. E.g. differential educational opportunities. In cases of underlying language impairment, the person may exhibit the same deficiencies in L1 and L2. People often have prejudicial views of their own language proficiency which they equate with 'knowing the grammar'. Therefore, they may be assuming that because they know more about the 'grammar' of one language, they know the language better. Similarly, native speakers often label educated non-native speakers as speaking 'better English' than them because they use certain constructions and choose more formal vocabulary. 

Is it worth even tracking the SOV order in languages and then asking this question. Why is the subject more likely to precede object across all human languages. 

You misstate the crux of the so called "poverty of the stimulus" argument. It does not say that language is too difficult for children because it obviously is not. The point is that even with remarkably impoverished stimulus (with some very few extremes like feral children being the exception), children seem to acquire syntactic structures for which they simply did not receive enough input to form meaningful generalizations. This argument has been attacked from many angles, some from misunderstanding but others, in my view completely convincing. 

Almost everything a linguist will know about language will be counterintuitive to many native speakers. I've spent years teaching grammar to native speakers of English as well as intro to linguistics so I have come across a lot of things that completely dumbfound people. Here are some areas to look into: Phonetics and phonology 

you have at more options than it may appear: ate, had, cooked, made, bought, etc. Perhaps the only parts of speech you could do this with with some success are prepositions but even here, you couldn't guarantee 100% accuracy. Consider the blank in '_ the sea' 

The window was opened by John. (The door/it/something) was opened by John for Mary. *The window was opened. / *The window opened by John. The window was opened by itself. (in some sort of cartoon universe) 

I think you'll probably find Alexandra Aikhenvald and her book on evidentiality a good starting point on the cross linguistic front. But of course, subjectivity is much more complex than the associated morphosyntax. I think Ari Verhagen cognitive linguistic treatment of Intersubjectivity addresses many important issues related to the semantics and pragmatics of subjectivity. 

You could generate your own list of collocations or use an existing one (e.g. $URL$ or Google n-grams). You could then run a sentence through a prediction tree and every time you'd come with a high enough number of predictability, you could delete the word. I have no idea how accurate this would be but I suspect that you would have to set a high threshold to get much accuracy and this would result in most sentences not having blanks. Things would be much easier if each blank had a multiple choice. Then you could look for semantically and collocationally distant words. Google n-grams and WordNet and FrameNet would come in handy, here. Like: 

There are many spoken English corpora available. But generally, you need to ask more questions than 'plain text' before you find the right one. Length, level of annotation, format of annotation, type of conversation, genre/register, dialect, natural vs. elicited, etc. Those will all depend on the type of research questions you want to answer. If you just want any one corpus you could try: 

I'd like to offer an alternative perspective to all the answers offered so far. First, I'd like to rephrase the question and then react to the other answers with some general points. 

The acquisition of phonology is fairly well studied for English. And although, there is a lot of variation among individuals and there are no definite sequences or ages of acquisition, you can find fairly reliable tendencies across the population. However, these may not be very useful (to a lay person or even a linguist not trained in speech therapy) trying to determine whether any individual child is developing typically or there is cause for concern. Any list of these stages would be too long for here but you can find it in any introductory text on linguistics that covers language acquisition (partly because it is the one area of language acquisition where there is some certainty). This Wikipedia article does a very good job of describing some of the key phases. 

Question marks are not universal as is not any punctuation or orthography. In fact, the term universal is generally applied to features of language that arise 'organically' - that is without specific intervention (although the level of intervention in all language change is probably greater than the word 'organic' implies). So it makes no sense to ask is the traffic stop sign universal because it emerged through an explicit policy context. However, you can ask things like 'is the traffic stop sign' used the same way in all countries, do drivers interpret in the same way? The same goes for the question mark. While its spread and adoption are not a result of an international legislative process, its use is a result of the spread of Latin orthography in the colonial era - as is the whole idea of punctuation. As a result some marking of questions (and ends of sentences, etc.) has now entered many orthographies including the non-Latin ones (like Chinese) that never previously had them. Of course, we know that punctuation (or even spaces between words) did not arise naturally in all orthographies and it took a good thousand years for them to appear in Latin and Greek alphabetic writing and another half a millennium to achieve some sort of standardization. In every language that uses orthography with punctuation (and it has probably made inroads - at least to some degree - to most orthographies now), the same punctuation marks will be used in slightly different contexts and with slightly different meanings and not all punctuation marks will be used (see answers to this question on Quora). Each language will develop conventions and standards for how the punctuation marks should be used and these will differ across languages or even styles/genres within languages. The actual form of the question mark is obviously not universal at all. You already mentioned Spanish but Greek uses the semi-colon (;) (or something very similar to it) to mark questions. You can see here for more characters.
