It is not just that empiricism works, and in 300 years has brought us from semaphore lines to global high speed interconnects, or that non-empiricism is a fervent breeding ground for falsehoods and mysticism; those are true and more than justify aversion to the magical, but they don't explain why that should be the case. Rather, it is that in the modern day we come further and further to irrefutable evidence that people are empirical. I will not go into detail on the evidence, but it suffices to say that if you agree to this much you also understand that there is nothing that you can do, even in theory, that a machine cannot. There is no mental magic that lets you probe beyond the veil. There is no mystical wand to wave that lets your knowledge constitute more than a map to the territory. Even if there was such a contortion of reason it would be nothing that could not in principle be done by another appropriate arrangement of gears and lasers. There is no higher level of knowledge than empirical knowledge because that is all that can be known. No matter how smart you are, Solomonoff induction is smarter. No matter how wise you are, your mind can only be causally related to causal objects. A devotion to a "higher level of truth" leads to epistemic voids like zombies or the ontological argument, arguments that seem appealing on the outset but do nought but waste time. In contrast empirical work is why we can now talk about the consciousness of brains under fully homomorphic encryption, or the measurement problem, real problems that represent huge leaps in the boundaries of philosophical discussion. Even when talking about the mind, or issues like free will, actual progress is made through empirical study. If you want to say that empirical arguments do not stand at the same height as the rest of philosophy, I would not disagree, but it is certainly not because it is lower. Until brute philosophy can make a single step forward in its own field the way Copernicus, or Turing, or Darwin, or Everett, did upon it, I hardly see much competition. 

Thus, it seems to me that to know something must imply knowing that you know something. Only semantically could it be possible to say that this is false; one may argue that you don't really think about knowing something, so you don't know that you know something (if knowledge is instead defined also as something that you must be aware of). However, using the common epistemological definition, you must know that you know something if you know anything at all. 

An important thing to keep in mind when reading Nietzsche is that most of the time he is trying to reveal things through insights. The point of this particular quotation is to reveal the assumption at the base of many philosophies (in this case, most specifically positivism): that objective facts exist. Positivism holds, roughly, that the phenomena we observe through our senses are physical in nature and that they actually happen in a material world. Thus positivists take these phenomena as objective fact and use it for their world-explanation, for example by making physical laws. Nietzsche's statement is that fundamentally, positivists are interpreting observed phenomena as physical (instead of non-physical, e.g. Berkeley), and real, when in fact they have no definite justification to do so. Thus, facts are really the subjective result of information: there is nothing necessarily "true" about them, other than how they fit into a particular interpretation. Just as the interpretation of a book is up to the reader, so too is Nietzsche pointing out that the interpretation of our world is up to the person observing. Now, here he does not make any claim as to whether, as with a book, there is an "author" who intended a particular meaning that we are supposed to pick up on, and that this meaning is the "correct" interpretation, but holistically that idea would probably be repugnant to Nietzsche: he effectively rejects all teleology, metaphysics, and meaningful notion of truth, which leaves no room for there to be a "correct" interpretation of the world. Ultimately what this means is that, to Nietzsche, it is much less important whether we "understand" how the world "works" (if that is even a meaningful thing to say), and much more important that we develop an interpretation that works for us. One of Nietzsche's primary themes is the advance of humanity into a stronger (intellectually, culturally, and maybe physically) race, and the proper interpretation of the world could aid in achieving this. In Nietzsche's terms (and this is straying from this quotation against positivism to a generalized summary of Nietzsche), this would be the interpretation that best frees us from life-rejecting restraints such as Good vs Evil and lets us become stronger by exercising our will to power and working toward the overman. 

The fallacy fallacy, which is argumentum ad logicam, is the fallacy of inferring falsity from fallacy. Falsity cannot be validly inferred from falsity. 

The argument in red cannot be deduced validly from the argument in green. All they have in common is that they're both arguments with two premises. To answer the question in the title, every conditional sentence (i.e. any hypothetical proposition) has a logically equivalent disjunction wherein the protasis is a negated disjunct and the apodosis is not a negated disjunct. "If P then Q" means "Q or not-P". In conventional notation of symbolic logic, P→Q is a hypothetical proposition that is logically equivalent to the disjunction Q∨¬P. Therefore, modus ponens has the following form: 

There is an important difference between the paradox of the heaps and the fallacy of the heaps. The former also is known as the continuum paradox or the sorites paradox (from σωρείτης), and the latter also is known as the continuum fallacy or sorites fallacy. (soros, from σωρός, is Greek for "heap".) The paradox of the heaps is the paradox described in the prompt-question of this thread. A man was once a boy, but the instant the boy became a man is equivocal. The continuum of a lifetime seems to make arbitrary any rigid designations of time distinguishing childhood from adulthood. Nonetheless, it would be fallacious to argue that this, on its own, implies that a lifetime either is entirely childhood or is entirely adulthood. It is a fallacy of the heaps to argue that the fact of continuum precludes any meaningful distinctions of regions along a continuum. For example, amounts of heat vary on a continuum, and water boils/freezes when it becomes sufficiently hot/cold such that, on a heat-continuum, there are meaningfully distinct regions. Therefore, it is not true that, for every continuum, there are no meaningfully distinct regions. Of course, there are some continuums in which there do not seem to be any meaningfully distinct regions. For example, the real number line, as a continuum of 1-dimensional space, does not seem to have any meaningful distinct regions, although it has meaningfully distinct subsets (e.g. the set of integers, of irrational numbers, and of natural numbers). 

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has an extensive article on category theory and its philosophical implications. On the significance of the theory, it says that: 

It certainly seems plausible to claim that we occasionally behave like p-zombies. However, philosophers such as Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore have taken the claim one step further, arguing that everybody is always a p-zombie. How exactly do they pull this off? Well, they simply deny that consciousness exists at all! They say that what we think is special as consciousness is really just a consequence of the much less significant access consciousness, i.e. all the stuff our brains do much the same way as any computer (e.g. storing and retrieving information, responding to stimuli, etc.). Thus it's just a trick of the mind to think that we have something more than "lifeless" machines do. We feel like we have "hard" consciousness as a result of all the things our minds do, but this is not the case. Of course, they assert that this does nothing to the significance of our minds. In Blackmore's words, we are p-zombies "that can talk and think about mental images, dreams and feelings; that can marvel at the beauty of a sunset or the light rippling in the trees; but if we think that being conscious is something separable from all of this, we are mistaken"(Consciousness: An Introduction). In any case, this is an incredibly counter-intuitive view for most and very hard to swallow. Still, it has some appeal and may be promising. 

Humans are a coherent process born of noise, formed by an incoherent filter over billions of years of jitter, and millenia of social development. At one point we figured out how to speak and to write. Some humans even told stories and wrote books that told others what to think, and a few of those even replicated wildly. Over time we have discovered systems of values, in which we encode what we have learnt. If we were conscious states in an ever-forgetful beast, we may have been born indifferent of continuity. If we were all facets of a single mind, far too large to have a coherent self but at no point separate from the rest, we may not even experience a sense of self, never mind value it. Had we neither need nor want to reproduce, it seems no stretch to believe it would have no place in our moral landscape. You ask for a universal coherent narrative on which to hang your thoughts, as if the hanger by itself would make others agree, the same way you view mathematics as true and others bound by your deductions. Yet though there is no such narrative, you can still see what is true, you want people to know what is good, you value a productive society, you see others believing the same. If God handed you the truth on a plate, you would still only take what you already believe; no offer would make you butcher children, no demand would make you stop caring about your own sadness. As long as you can feel these things you feel, you have a handle to the truth. You can wait to be passed the Mythical One True Handle so you can grab it should it compare identical to your own, or you can take the one you have already and move forward now. If you care so much about truth, look it straight in the eye and do the things that would be right if only you had a God to tell you so. More generally, on a societal level it seems very strange to pin modern zeitgeists on modern atheism. The religious past was not more productive, nor did they really love thy neighbor. Many other effects are much easier targets, like how huge global networks tend to polarize and how modern economics doesn't work like it used to. But regardless of whether this is to blame or that, it is your actions that shape society, and if you think an action is good you need not lie to yourself about why in order to take it. 

My philosophy teacher and I are having a little disagreement regarding The Prince: He argues that although the book's context is a letter to Lorenzo de' Medici advising him and recommending a course of action to unite Italy, ultimately this is just a "cloak" for an almost purely ethical argument. My teacher believes that all of Machiavelli's political philosophy and recommendations on how a Prince should effectively act also represent Machiavelli's idea of right and wrong, and how a Prince should morally act. Thus, when he says: 

I think there are two sides to your question: whether the "contradictions" you state actually pose a problem, and whether it is even physically possible to have an infinity of something. To the former, the answer is that though your description of what one could do with infinite apples "seems absurd," it is nonetheless perfectly valid. If indeed I have an infinity of apples (for simplicity let us assume it is the smallest infinity, countably many apples - a set of cardinality aleph-null), then I could take countably many apples from that set and make as many infinite sets of apples as I want - in theory. It is just a mathematical fact that one can remove countably many numbers from a countably infinite set, and if one does it right, one will get two infinite sets. And one can do that countably many times, getting an infinite number of infinite sets of apples. However, I think the philosophically relevant issue in your question is whether this could even be possible in practice. Sure, theoretically infinitely many apples isn't a logically incoherent concept, but you want to know if it can ever happen. Well, the shape of the Universe is presently an open question, but what looks most likely is that it is flat and infinite in extent. It is a physically coherent (and presently quite popular) theory to suggest that the Universe is infinite in size, and by corollary (assuming the cosmological principle of homogeneity and isotropy holds), that there is an infinite amount of matter in existence. However, it's important to note that this is not a useful fact. Because of limitations such as the speed of light and the Planck scale, which both limit the amount of information we can receive, it really isn't possible to have, within one's range of observation, infinitely many things. This is a twofold argument. First, if the objects have finite size, they must take up infinite volume and thus extend to infinitely far away. Thus, in finite time (which is the only sort of time we have), we will never have information about all of the objects (in fact, we will always have information from almost none of them, mathematically speaking) since there will never be enough time for light to carry their information two us. Second, if the objects are infinitesimal small (if that is even possible), they will be effectively unobservable due to the way the Planck scale works, so we won't even see them. So the summary is that infinity is physically coherent but not useful on any remotely familiar scale. 

Lot: What an amazing day this is! How lucky I am! How jubilant! Baye: What has your spirits up so high today? Lot: You would never have guessed! I'm going to win the lottery! I just know it! Baye: (sighing) You know that's unlikely. What makes your ticket special? Lot: Oh, I don't have a ticket. (Baye headdesks) Baye: Ouch. You're not going to win the lottery. Why would you even think you were going to win the lottery? Lot: I don't need evidence! What makes you so certain anyhow? How do you know I'm not going to win the lottery? There are thousands of ways it could happen! Someone could walk in right now and hand me a winning ticket! Baye: The mere possibility of a situation is not reason to believe it! Lot: Hmph. As far as I'm concerned it will either happen or it won't. That makes it 50-50. Your certitude is no better than mine. Baye: (screaming inside) That is not how probabilities work! Lot: Well that's just, like, your opinion, man. Baye: No, it's not. The way we reason about probabilities is not an arbitrary choice out of all the ways you can assign numbers to events. Bayesian statistics is not just just a postulate, it is a mathematically ideal solution given natural assumptions. Competitive markets repeatedly demonstrate that these formal models of the world are better predictors. A 50% probability should be right 50% of the time. Some ways of looking at the world are just right, and some are just wrong. 

My own interpretation is that Plato actually argues that although a regime decays, the human soul is perpetually rising toward its best state. For this interpretation, I first determined that Plato thinks of the level of education in a city (or soul) as analogous to its regime. Therefore, the more education there is in a city, or the better educated a soul is, the closer that soul/city is to the top of the regimes (the aristocracy). I think this point is fairly obvious in any reading of The Republic, so I'll skip over explaining why I think education is proportional to regime for Plato (if you would like me to explain it, please leave a comment and I'll add it in). Regarding my interpretation that Plato sees the soul as in perpetual growth, the following quotation is very relevant: 

Note that there is some debate about this definition, but that is another question. Now, Bonjour's coherentist disagreement with this idea is that the perceived regress used in foundationalism is actually not a problem. He argues (as you've summarized) that justification for a belief lies in its coherence with some standard of belief (in this case, our own system of beliefs). This system need not satisfy the foundationalist property of non-inferential knowledge, because coherentism takes it as epistemically valid by itself. Thus, roughly, Bonjour would assert the following: 

Popper is pointing out that, when these are not properly distinguished by scientists, category mistakes like "it was before the beginning of time" or "something came from nothing" can be made. "It was before the beginning of time" is false a priori because "before" has the extension "is at a time that is followed by" such that "before" is in the category "time" and, thus, it is a contradiction for there to be a time before time if the extension of time includes every referent for "before" and "after". "Something came from nothing" is defective in that identifying any referent for "nothing" falls into a paradox of self-reference and, moreover, such a statement usually is a vague way of saying, "Something presently known came from nothing presently known", which is a categorically different idea from "something came from nothing". 

In response to (2), "The definite integral, from x=a to x=b, of Euler's number multiplied by itself x-number of times" is not a sentence, but rather is a predicate term when combined with a copula. Therein, it can be a word as a propositional term that is a referent of the aforementioned predicate term. It is a word to the extent that a predicate without a copula can be a word. It is a predicate because it refers to the properties that are in the extension of that mathematical function. To equate the function to something is to create a sentence wherein "equals" is the predicate's copula. For example, "The definite integral, from x=a to x=b, of Euler's number multiplied by itself x-number of times equals the number Z", in first-order logic, has the following form (wherein P is the predicate term "is equal to the number Z" and wherein Q is the predicate term "is equal to the definite integral, from x=a to x=b, of Euler's number multiplied by itself x-number of times": ∃y:Py∧Qy. Whether or not the categorical proposition is true is another matter entirely. It's possible that ∃y:Py∧Qy is false such that ∄y:Py∧Qy possibly is true. 

I disagree with this argument because it is guilty of a straw man. What is crucial to this logically valid argument is the premise that some chronology applies to God (which is apparent in the words "future" and "predict"). However, the common concept of God is, as mentioned, supernatural; God is outside of our physical realm, and since the early 20th century, we've known that our physical realm includes the fourth dimension of time. Therefore, this argument is unsound. An omniscient God would not be "predicting" somebody's "future" but simply knowing what exists as part of the four-dimensional space time. Imagine the universe as a 3D hologram film, and you'll understand that when you look at the whole thing and know it all, you're not predicting but rather you have simply seen everything there is. You don't see the film passing by, but its entire existence is in front of you (I find a mountain range image also helpful), and if you were an omniscient God, you would know everything that happens; there is no "future" or "past" but just the truth. A logical argument from these premises is: 

I just read the page, and there is certainly no hint of idealism involved. That would imply that Chalmer's idea involves mental ontology, a sort of rejection of physicalism. Rather, his theory is particularly physicalist; you will notice that he politely turns away from any spiritual, supernatural explanations for experience (the focus of his "hard problem of consciousness") and rather tries to develop a physicalist-compatible explanation. I will try to explain the general ideas involved, and in doing so show that these ideas are very physicalist and empirically oriented. Therefore, they do not address idealism at all but as we shall see, physicalism and a sort of dualism. Chalmer rejects reductionist attempts at explaining the problem of experience, and rather suggests that we use a non-reductive (but physical) approach; perhaps experience itself is something fundamental. Perhaps it is some property of our physical world that is not explained by anything else because it just is itself. This is much like our models of the electron and other fundamental particle - we do not seek to explain what makes up an electron (as of yet, it just appears to be a point particle), but just accept it as something that cannot be reduced. This is the gist of Chalmer's theory, and demonstrates that he approaches the problem with a focus on physicalist explanations; this is quite incompatible with idealism, as he is arguing that the world itself has some fundamental property (particle?) called experience, and it is not part of the human mentality.
