As far as I know the definition is yet to be extended beyond two person games, but you seem to be looking for some notion of antagonism. A two player game is antagonistic if given any two outcomes A and B, if player one prefers outcome A then and only then player two prefers outcome B. Read more here. 

As @user32416 pointed out the first order stationarity conditions are not enough. Specifically it seems that you violate Slater's condition, which states that "the feasible region must have an interior point". There are no $x,y$ for which $$(x+y-2)^2 < 0.$$ If you rephrase the problem to $$\max (xy)$$ $$x+y-2 = 0$$ $$x,y \geq 0$$ Slater's condition is met (for linear conditions no interior points are necessary) and you can apply Karush-Kuhn-Tucker. 

Another thing to consider is that the Athens Olympic Games were held in 2004. The cost of the games alone, not including infrastructure projects, is estimated around \$10 billion. A lot of construction work was done during the previous two years. The increased government spending may also have benefited other sectors indirectly (multiplicator effects). This could explain another part of the 50% increase. There is only one problem with the argument above. According to the suspiciously smooth data I have found, there was no sudden increase in Greek government expenditures during these two years. (Click on max to see the long term.) 

Demand curves are frequently not functions but mappings, e.g. in the case of perfectly elastic demand. So you could not guarantee 'nice' functions anyway. In this coordinate system the surpluses (producer's and consumer's) are areas under the curves. The explanation is more intuitive and it is somewhat easer to see which integral you have to take. 

In your final comment you also note that good 2 is inferior. As can be seen from your demand function $$ x^*(p, w) = \left(\frac{p_2 w}{p_1(4p_1 + p_2)} , \frac{4p_1 w}{p_2(4p_1 + p_2)}\right) $$ this is not true. If income were to increase $x_2^*(p, w)$ would increase as well. 

PPP uses the price level, the price of the consumer basket. The price level can be identical without all prices being identical. An example: Consider a consumer basket with just two goods and assume the weight of both goods in the basket is one half. If $p_1 = p_2 = 4$ then the price of the consumer basket is $$ P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot p_1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot p_2 = 4. $$ However you get the same price level if you have $p_1 = 3, p_2 = 5$. So you can have two countries with identical price levels but differing prices. The converse of course is not possible. Thus LOOP implies PPP but PPP does not imply LOOP. 

Currently competition authorities usually decide whether to approve a merger or not based on the total revenues or capacities of the merging firms and some rule of thumbs. A reason for this is that they do not always have a stronger mandate because of the legal background. Merger simulation models promise a more analytical policy approach. For a good survey see Budsinki & Ruhmer (2010). It is my understanding that the kind of data needed to estimate the demand function of a market, or usually demand functions in the case of differentiated products, is not publicly available. Yet rival companies frequently have similar data which they use to estimate their market share. How would one go about legally acquiring such data? Are there any ways with which to estimate cross elasticities without said data? 

It seems to me that this will not make a difference if you only consider pure strategies. Consider that player $i$'s winnings is $x$ and from this he gets utility $U_i(x)$. As long as $U_i()$ is increasing in $x$ player $i$ will prefer outcomes with larger winnings to lower ones, which is exactly what he would do if he had constant marginal returns. Another way of forming this argument is that as long as $U_i()$ is increasing another utility function representing the same preferences over outcomes would be $\hat{U}_i(x) = x$. (You can perform a monotone transformation that transfers $U_i()$ to this.) 

As you stated the strategy set in the traditional chicken game has two elements and in the Akagi version it is an interval, so there will be no bijective mapping between the two. If I misunderstood and you are using a different notion of equivalence please clarify. Also as you state in the Akagi version there are weakly dominant strategies but in the traditional version there are none. I believe the story of the traditional version is rather about two cars driving towards each other and you have to decide whether to swerve at the last moment or trust that the other driver will. Even if you were to extend the strategies to allow swerving before the last moment this game would differ from the Akagi version, because here not swerving at all is better than swerving at the last moment if the other driver swerves at last moment whereas swerving at the last moment is better if the other does not swerve at all, hence there are no weakly dominant strategies. 

The textbook probably means growth rate and not absolute growth. Given your assumptions $$ \frac{\frac{d}{dt}Div_t}{Div_t}= \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\text{Earnings}_t}{\text{Earnings}_t} $$ does hold. 

Buying and selling of currencies in Argentina is currently strongly controlled by the government: $URL$ This means that you cannot buy as many Dollars as you want, but the ones you buy you get at a government controlled exchange rate, which is actually cheaper. The Argentine government might have to pay 10 Pesos for a Dollar, but they sell it to the importer for 8 Pesos. They do this so that consumer prices do not spiral out of control. Hence the current exchange rate is not what it would be in an uncontrolled market. Further devaluation (controlled by the government) is expected next year, because this subsidized exchange is too costly for the government: $URL$ As for your second question: while the Peso may not have any value outside of Argentina, individuals and firms that buy products in Argentina will still have a use for it. For example a US firm importing and selling Argentine beef will trade Dollars for Pesos. 

Your general question is in my opinion far more interesting than the course problem, so I will answer that. What conditions characterise “cheap-talk” games? 

Questions with numbers are usually not as good as questions without numbers. If you had written down the formula for CV and EV you would probably have noticed that your premise is false. 

I am somewhat unsure where your exact difficulty lies (and hence what your question is). As you write the two Pareto impromevents are $(a,b),(a,c)$. Meaning $b$ and $c$ can be improved upon and are not efficient. Also $(a,d)$ is an improvement, notice that individual 2 is indifferent while others prefer $a$ to $d$. Alternative $a$ cannot be improved upon, and hence it is Pareto-efficient. So the Pareto-set would be $\left\{a\right\}$. 

Some critiques claim that the regulatory system will be closer to US regulation which favours companies over consumers. In terms of patent rights it may also not be optimal, though the effect of patent systems on long term growth is unclear anyway. I find that these are valid worries. Even if TTIP does decrease prices (which I think it will) there may be hidden costs. I don't know if there are, but I think it should be this that is scrutinized about TTIP. 

The independence of the central bank means that the bank is independent of the government. A mandate of the central bank is to ensure price stability. However as any excess cash the bank prints is the property of the government. The government enjoys having extra income and were it allowed to exercise direct control it may push to bank to print more money. This would undermine the price stability mandate of the bank. Hence in most countries they give the central bank leadership that is independent of the government. As Bitcoin is not issued by any government that I know of it does not in any way affect this. Perhaps if the government were to bribe the leaders of the bank in Bitcoin... 

This is the usual specification. On the top of page 14 it is written that $$ w_t = \beta Q_t/N_t. $$ Given a competitive labor market you have $$ w_t = \frac{\partial Q_t}{\partial N_t}. $$ If you assume the production function above then you indeed have $$ \frac{\partial Q_t}{\partial N_t} = \beta Q_t/N_t. $$ 

In the 1. equilibrium the price ratio is $p = \frac{a_{x,E}}{a_{y,E}} < \frac{a_{x,P}}{a_{y,P}}$. Thus Portugal specializes and only produces good $y$, but England does not specialize but produces both good $x$ and $y$. Producing either good gives her the same value. The exact equilibrium quantities England produces are determined by the value the aggregate demand curve takes at price $p$, because $$ \frac{q_x}{q_y} = \frac{c_x}{c_y} = \frac{1}{p} $$ and $$ q_x = q_{x,E} + q_{x,P} = q_{x,E} + 0 \hskip 20pt q_y = q_{y,E} + q_{y,P} = q_{y,E} + \frac{L_P}{a_{y,P}}. $$ In this case England will still not achieve a net export of good $y$. The preferences tell us that Portugal will consume both goods $x$ and $y$. But the only way it can pay for the goods $x$ consumed is by trading some of its goods $y$, so Portugal, not England, will be a net exporter of good $y$ while England is a net exporter of good $x$. In the 2. equilibrium both countries specialize: England produces only good $x$, Portugal produces only good $y$. This is usually presented as the textbook case. The 3. equilibrium is like the 1. equilibrium, but here England specializes and produces only good $x$ while Portugal does not specialize and produces both. So to answer my original questions: Given that England has a comparative advantage in producing good $x$, 

I assume you are talking about preferences? In case you are talking about mathematical relations in general, $\geq$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not complete, as neither $(0,1) \geq (1,0)$ nor the opposite holds. In case you are talking about preferences or decision theory, I don't think you can come up with any examples that violate completeness. The issue is that there is a set of choices which can violate transitivity, but there are none for completeness. If a preference ordering is not complete then we are unable to forecast your decision even with perfect knowledge of your preferences. Empirically this would mean that we forecast your choosing $A$, but you choose $B$ instead. Obviously we could correct for this by forecasting $B$, so next time you would have to choose $A$ or $C$ or some other alternative. Unfortunately this could also mean that you are indifferent between the choices and then your preferences would still be complete. There are some suggestions on how to deal with this: Perhaps if you are unable to make a choice, you do not have to make a choice. But this can be regarded as a regular alternative $D$, like all the others, and then the above reasoning applies. Perhaps you can choose more than one alternatives. Again, indifference and being unable to tell the difference would be indistinguishable. There are probably some assumptions you could make on the preferences to solve this (e.g. all preferences are strict) but I cannot think of any that in my opinion would be realistic. 

Given this definition the simultaneous move examples seem strange. The games mentioned (e.g. iterated prisoner's dilemma) could easily be altered to have sequential moves where the second mover is simply not aware of the first move. This game would have the same extensive form but would no longer fit the informal definition. 

There are limitations on what an individual can pay by money though. One might argue that there were a lot of people who were willing to do anything to get a space (push in line, etc.). As long as the number of these people is larger than the supply and the price is measured in effort your graph would describe the market for places. 

Short answer: Denoting income by $I$, price by $p$, the demand function by $D(I,p)$ and income elasticity of demand by $\eta$, the definition of point elasticity of income is $$ \eta = \frac{\text{d}D(I,p)}{\text{d}I}\frac{I}{D(I,p)}. $$ So the change in demand comes from a change in income. Long answer: Without specifying your coordinate system the terms "movement along the curve" and "shift of the curve" are meaningless. Consider the function $f(a,x) = a/x$. Suppose this function determines the value of a variable $y$, that is $y = f(a,x)$. Given $a$ we can plot $f(a,x)$ in the $(x,y)$ coordinate system. If $x$ changes there is movement along the curve in this coordinate system. If $a$ changes the curve shifts in this coordinate system. However treating $a$ as a variable and given $x$ we could also plot $f(a,x)$ in the $(a,y)$ coordinate system. Then change in $a$ would mean movement along the curve and change in $x$ would shift the curve. As quantity demanded usually depends on both income and price, you face a similar situation, where $q = D(I,p)$. Income elasticity examines a change in income, but without specifying if your curve is ploted in $(p,q)$ or $(I,q)$ you cannot classify the change in $I$ as either "movement along the curve" or "shift of the curve". 

Each student can report 6 preference orders. However, eliminating strictly dominated strategies (no need to calculate actual expected payoffs, you can use basic logic based on their real preference orders and the availability of places) reduces this to 2 orders per student. A second iteration of elimination reduces s2's strategy set to a single order. The third iteration reduces s1's and s3's strategy set to a single order as well. These reported preference orders constitute the Nash-equilibrium. 

It would vary from case to case. To clarify: You can set whatever you want as a null hypothesis, even $B_0 = \pi$. You have to choose your null based on what you are testing for. An example: Suppose I flip a 1 euro coin once everyday and you win it if it comes out heads. Let $Y_i$ denote your winnings on day $i$ and let $X_i$ be the average temperature of day $i$. If you gathered data for a year you could probably not reject $B_1 = 0$. If the coin is fair (50% chance of heads) then you can also not reject $B_0 = \frac{1}{2}$. (This makes $u$ a random variable with mean 0.) But suppose it is a trick coin that never comes out heads. Then $B_0$ is 0. So if you want to test fairness, you would say in your null hypothesis that $B_0 = \frac{1}{2}$. If you reject this then you assume the coin is not fair. But remember that the unit of measurement of $B_0$ here is not probability, but euros. If I had a 2 euro coin instead of a 1 euro coin your null to measure fairness should be $B_0 = 1$. Thus even when testing for the same thing, the value of $B_0$ in your null would vary from case to case. 

Your basic assumptions seem to be $$ p(q_a) = AVC(q_a) $$ and as the difference between price and average variable cost is decreasing before $q_a$ and increasing after it you also assume $$ \frac{d \ \left(p(q) - AVC(q)\right)}{d \ q} < 0. $$ (More on the necessity of this assumption later.) We can rewrite this second assumption to $$ \frac{d \ p(q)}{d \ q} - \frac{d \ \frac{VC(q)}{q}}{d \ q} = \frac{d \ p(q)}{d \ q} - \frac{MC(q) \cdot q - VC(q)}{q^2} < 0. $$ Multiplying by $q>0$ yields $$ \frac{d \ p(q)}{d \ q} \cdot q - MC(q) - AVC(q) < 0. $$ Adding $p(q) + AVC(q)$ we get $$ \frac{d \ p(q)}{d \ q} \cdot q + p(q) - MC(q) < p(q) - AVC(q). $$ The left hand side is now $MR(q) - MC(q)$. It follows from our two initial assumptions that $$ \forall q > q_a: \ p(q) < AVC(q). $$ Then for such values of $q$ $$ MR(q) - MC(q) < p(q) - AVC(q) < 0. $$ Because of this there can be no $q_b > q_a$ such that $MR(q_b) = MC(q_b)$.
