Strictly speaking the answer should be M4, M5 or M6. This specifies the threading as well* (M4x0.7, M5x0.8 and M6x1 is implied, where the thread is given in mm/turn). The hex key for turning them will also have a size in mm, always smaller than the diameter, by how much depends on the head shape. I would say M5 are the most common, based on a very small sample size. *There are technically fine and extra fine metric threads, but you won't find them on a bike or in a hardware store. 

I'm fairly tall (6'4" or 195cm), and the bike I'm looking for is fairly specialised these days (a tourer, presumably steel, possibly with a sideline as a gravel bike/off-road tourer but no need for full-on CX specs and I need heel clearance). I ride a hybrid. My total road bike miles add up to about the same as a decent ride on my hybrid (42 miles) and those were on a too-small bike. So I'm not familiar with road bike fit. I do know that if I can get the saddle high enough I'll be OK for easily an hour in the saddle of anything. Nowhere stocks a range of tourers in my size. Even finding one single tourer in stock in my size is rare (tourers don't sell fast). Of course many places can get one in, try to fit it, fail, send it back, try again... But how do I maximise my chances of getting it right first time? I don't see that a rough fit on a typical road bike or even a CX bike would be very informative, as I'm after the long wheelbase, relaxed geometry of a tourer. It feels like I could extrapolate as well from flat bars. I'd almost be glad if these assumptions were wrong, but I might take a little convincing. The next step of course is testing it to make sure it fits -- with everything set nominally right it will feel a bit odd as I'm used to flat bars. How can I tell whether this is bad-odd or OK-odd in a short test ride? Part of my concern is that I'm looking at the Genesis Tour de Fer, and I'm at the top end of the largest size -- by some shops' size guides I should be OK, but not according to others (including the one I may buy it from) 

You might also look into electric front wheel kits (for your existing bike). They're certainly available for 26" and 700C wheels; maybe your recumbent has smaller wheels which might require a custom solution. You would then have a choice of battery pack sizes as well. If you really like the recumbent then this might prove worthwhile. 

This question at aviation.se got me calculating the acceleration of a bike strapped to the outside of a plane if the straps broke. As you do. I couldn't find a figure for CdA of a bike without rider anywhere, and it seems to me that the rider's body will dominate the system CdA. A more realistic situation for most of us would be consdering the forces on a bike on top of a car, again from the point of view of secure attachment (e.g. tryiong to fit an unusual bike with home-made brackets). So are there published figures for the CdA of bikes (any type) without riders? 

Ball end Allen keys tend to feel looser than square end. While useful you should only really use them when you have to because the contact area is much less so they wear the screws faster. The tools also round off easily, making it easy to wreck screw heads (even in such a way that they feel fine at home, but then fail with your roadside tools) 

Wth the childs's legs sticking forward the way the website suggests, you've got no hope. You could easily check this by fitting the seat and trying to ride without the child -- that way you don't even need to do the clamps up tight. You're also likely to find that the slumped-foward head rest sticks into your lower back and means that you're badly positioned on the saddle -- just what you don't want when you're controlling a bike with an extra load up high. It's got more support than most front-mount seats but in general they're designed for you to have your arms round the child and your back behind them. This one still has a very low back, and if the child falls asleep behind you they'll be flopping around like crazy and you won't know about it (though this happens even on much bigger rear seats as well, at least then their head can't flop backwards going over a bump.) Most people I see riding with front mount seats have to ride with their knees very wide to avoid the seat -- and this is a wider seat than I've seen on the road. It seems to me that there's only quite a limited set of bike/rider/conditions combinations for which front seats work: You need to be at the small end of your frame's adjustments, with wide bars, and riding on flat roads where you don't need to work hard to accelerate. 

With a hardtail like that you can fit a full rear mudguard that covers much more of the tyre, especially towards the back of the wheel, and covers it more closely With what you've got you're never going to keep your back from getting splashed. You can experiment with the angle and height to see if you can get a little better, but I doubt it's worth it. Those mudguards will keep the worst of the mud off your (lower) back but that's about all - fine drops of water get everywhere and soon soak you. 

On a sunny day you can often see the shadows without moving your head, so long as the sun isn't in front of you or too high. I sometimes pick up wheel suckers when commuting and while my commuter bike have mirrors its possible to ride too close for the mirror, but the shadows on the road work well if it's a sunny day. The mirror itself is a solution, but one that presumably doesn't appeal. I'm not normally so tucked, even in the drops, but sometimes you can dip your head and look between your legs. The garmin radar wouldn't help, but it's possible that some of the other rear alert systems could be set up - certainly rearview cameras would work. You could always ask them to let you know if you drop them, by shouting. 

Kids bikes tend to have the worst of the worst knobbly tyres, even when they're blatantly not meant for serious offroading. So you can start there, and that's an easy upgrade. If you go for kids MTBs, check the wheel size is something sensible, and put better tyres on. My default choice for riding on road is the marathon plus. That comes in 16", 20" and 24" as well as the more common adult sizes. They're not cheap but I'd spend the money to avoid punctures when out with kid(s), and they're very durable. Other, cheaper options are available even with puncture protection.
