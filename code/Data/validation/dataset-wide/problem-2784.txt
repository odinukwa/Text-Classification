I've been reading Machiavelli and I've noticed that his is very critical of Christianity in a way that reminds me of Nietzsche's Master-Slave morality; he does so by comparing the focus on 'heroic achievements' that the religions of Ancient Greece and Rome had with the focus on humility in Christianity, just like Nietzsche did: 

I would like to learn more about non-Western philosophy. I've already explored some of the Eastern philosophies (there are many books, websites,... on this subject), but it seems harder to get started with African philosophy. I know next to nothing about African philosophy. I would like to know the following: 

If you are looking for a book that explains the terms and fundamental concepts well, I have only one recommendation: The Philosopher's Toolkit and by extension The Ethics Toolkit. It explains all the important terms and concepts in a concise way. I've recommended this book to many people who felt they weren't quite ready to start reading philosophy and they all felt this book helped tremendously. 

Transcendental idealism, or critical idealism as Kant preferred to call it, is the view that our experience can only give us representations of things (i.e. how they appear to us; this is referred to as phenomenon), and that we can never know how these things are in themselves (this is what he referred to as noumenon or ding-an-sich). This does not mean that there is no real, objective world; it just means that this objective world is beyond the categories of human reason. We cannot know these things-in-themselves, only that they must exist in order to form the representations that we can experience. 

Much has been written about this. Wikipedia offers a good and accessible summary of proposed resolutions. In case you are interested in a more academic and thorough approach, the SEP-article on the Sorites-paradox is what you're looking for. 

This is actually something many atheists would acknowledge; they see no reason to call have a specific word for their religious position, because to them, it is the "natural position". Baron d'Holbach said: " "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God." Sam Harris wrote: 

I won't give you my "personal definition" of happiness, nor my opinion on the matter, since that's not really the purpose of a Q&A website. If you're interested in the subject in general, you could take a look at the SEP page on happiness and the Wikipedia page on the philosophy of happiness. Also, Alain de Botton has made a documentary on the philosophy of happiness of Epicurus. In fact, the series itself is called "Philosophy: a Guide to Happiness", so you may perhaps be interested in the other episodes too. 

Once you know this book really well, you are ready to move on. There are many texts and I don't really know which one to recommend, so I'll list a few. It's up to you which ones you pick. It may very well be that by this time, you already have your own preferences and therefore don't really need this list anymore. Many, if not all of these will already have been introduced by introductory books. 

Some good answers already; just wanted to add one important point. While critical thinking has been mentioned already, I want to stress one specific point, namely dealing with different and conflicting views. Learning philosophy teaches you how to do this, more so than any other discipline. There are certainly other disciplines that also make you think more critically, such as mathematics, in which rigorous proofs are required. However, such disciplines usually don't teach you how to deal with conflicting views, while philosophy is all about just that. Being able to deal with conflicting views is a very important in modern society. While many people prefer to be confronted with one view only - usually the one they would like to hear rather than the one that seems to approach the truth most, in many cases, there are many perspectives possible on the same matter. Raymond Queneau's book Exercises in Style does a perfect job demonstrating this fact. In this book, one anecdote is told in 99 different ways. This can be compared with how politicians or intellectuals (they seem to be mutually exclusive) all tell the same story in their own ways, from their own perspective and political views. As a philosophy student, if you hear one view, you will know that there are many others and you'll immediately start looking for them as the person speaks; you cannot bear just hearing that one view without trying to find out what the others are. You can teach in a book about critical thinking about logical fallacies and all that (although learning to spot logical fallacies instantly is more difficult), but this ability to think of other perspectives quickly and critically, is something that takes much longer. 

Yes, try to understand the meaning of the statements rather than translate literally without figuring out the meaning of a statement first. 

This does not necessarily mean that truth is nothing more than simply what the (scientific) community agrees upon, but rather that truth depends upon a consensus: 

In this form, I don't think there is a fallacy necessarily. They ask why he would leave his old position that pays him so much more for his new position, which seems to be a genuine question to me. 

As you can see in the picture above, the philosopher is outside the cave, driven by eros to find real knowledge (compare with Kant's noumena), while the layman is a prisoner in the cave, thinking that the images he sees on the wall (compare with Kant's phenomena) are real, while they are in fact nothing more than imitations of reality onto a wall. This is why Plato is said to dislike art so much. Consider the Idea chair. When a carpenter creates a chair, he imitates the Idea chair. However, when an artist paints that chair, he is making an imitation (his painting) of the imitation (the physical chair, made by the carpenter); he is, in other words, getting further and further away from the truth. Note that Plato is also not an idealist; he doesn't say that the mind makes up fundamental reality. On the contrary, his world of Ideas is the world of the unchanging, of being (i.e. independent of minds). 

(As a side note: a general rule to determine the truth value of an implication: if the value of q≥p, the implication holds (even if q and p are completely unrelated!). If you find this a bit absurd, you're not alone. Many Logicians find it a quite troublesome.) Or I can give a more absurd example: 

I fail to see how these philosophers' work, and most notably Plato's, is "predominantly analytic"; Plato's work had a huge metaphysical component in it, which cannot simply be ignored. 

If New York is in China, then New York is in the U.S.A. New York is not in China. Therefore, New York is not in the U.S.A. 

My question is whether Nietzsche knew about Machiavelli and whether he mentioned him in one of his writings? Was he influenced by Machiavelli? 

Your conclusion isn't necessarily false, as the top Venn-diagram shows, but it does not logically follow, as the bottom 2 Venn-diagrams show. 

I believe Einstein said this in response to criticism on his theories of special and general relativity. This criticism was a result of the fact that common sense did not seem to agree with Einstein's new theories. 

What is modal logic? Modal logic is an extension of classic propositional and predicate logic that allows the use of modal operators. In others words, modal logic is everything classic logic is + modal operators. Modal operators express modality, such as: 

You have just affirmed the consequent. You have committed a fallacy; your reasoning was wrong, so Socrates is not human. 

An axiom is something that is self-evidently true; it is so obvious that there is no controversy about it. In mathematics, you just have to accept some very basic notions in order to avoid circular reasoning. These can't be proven, but they can always (and often very easily) be observed. Example from Euclid's Elements: 

I'm surprised this wasn't mentioned before, at least not explicitly (it was implicitly pointed out in one of the comments, as this view is considered to be nihilistic): 

The first one that comes to mind is Sartre's Le Regard (The Look). It is a very concrete thought experiment I would say (i.e. one that you could encounter everyday), which is very typical for existentialist philosophy; it is 'rooted' in everyday experience. It is, however, not an easy one and I would recommend reading his Being and Nothingness (you'll probably need a companion to fully understand all of his ideas). It will take a while to get through it, but it's worth it. I will try to summarise the thought experiment in a brief and concise manner, however, I do think it's full value only becomes apparent once you know more about Sartre's work. Stage 1: alone Imagine you are alone in the park. What do you observe? Lifeless objects (the grass, the tree, a bench,...); (être-en-soi: "being-on-itself") In this stage, you are the centre of a world; not just the spatial centre, it is more than that: the quality of things are merely what they appear to be in your eyes. Stage 2: human being who does not see you A human being enters the park, you see him but he does not see you. This man, however, does observe certain things just like you did in stage 1. He sees the trees, the grass,... He is, just like you in stage 1, a centre of a world. He sees certain things you see as well, for instance a tree. In other words, the fields of vision of you and the man intersect. Sartre calls this "disintegration", which can be defined as a decomposition of your world. However, during this phase, the decomposition is still controllable, since the things that have a reference to him, but that reference is also part of your world. Stage 3: human being who sees you In stage 2, the man was the object of your perception. Now, that man sees you. You become the object of his perception (and you're aware of it). You are, in other words, objectified by the man (être-pour-autrui; "being-for-someone-else"). This is not just his business, it affects you as well. During this look, the other one disappears as an object for you. It's not that you can't see him anymore, it's just that you cannot observe him anymore (his look conceals his eyes). The other now has the power over us: he can "define us". Are you ugly? Only if he thinks you are! Are you smart? Only if he thinks you are! etc. From this moment onwards, we can feel ashamed (this can only happen when we are objectified by another human being). This is what Sartre means by "hell is other people", contrary to how he is often misquoted (it is not a misanthropic statement!). 

This book should be useful to gain encyclopaedic knowledge on philosophy; to memorise. Yes, I know insight is crucially important, especially in philosophy, but there are simply things that you have to know by heart and I'd like to have a resource in which this absolutely necessary knowledge can be found. This book should be intended for students who were already introduced to philosophy and already have a notion of the basic terms, concepts and evolutions. I have included an example of an article on Locke's Ideas that shows exactly what I'm looking for. A book with this kind of article on each philosopher, in chronological order, is exactly what I'm looking for. This is also a good example of an article on a particular subject (Idealism). If this were formatted a little bit better (i.e. in bullet-point lists), it would be almost perfect 

As many have said before me here, I think the question is self-defeating. You have the thought (i.e. it exists) to ask yourself whether there is a philosophy that asks whether nothing exist. The existence of the thought means that something exists and would famously give rise to Descartes' new foundation of all knowledge.
