Here's a proof of finiteness. First, it's a general fact that for any centerless directly indecomposable groups $A_1,\dots,A_k$, any automorphism permutes the $A_i$. References are welcome; one (in French), probably much too recent, is Proposition 2 p9 here (2006 paper by myself and Pierre de la Harpe). In particular, if all $A_i$ have finite Out, so does the product. This applies to $\Lambda=\prod_{i=1}^m\mathrm{PSL}_{n_i}(\mathbf{Z})=[\Gamma,\Gamma]/Z(\Gamma)$. It follows that some finite index subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ acts by inner automorphisms on $\Lambda$. To conclude, one has to show that the subgroup $F$ of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ acting as the identity on $\Lambda$ is finite. To show this, it is enough to show that the following finite index subgroup of $F$ is itself finite: the kernel $F'$ of the $F$-action on $Z(\Gamma)\times (\Gamma/[\Gamma,\Gamma])$. The $F'$-action on $[\Gamma,\Gamma]$ consists is by automorphisms of the form $g\mapsto gs(g)$ where $s$ are homomorphisms $[\Gamma,\Gamma]\to Z(\Gamma)$. Since $Z(\Gamma)$ is finite and $[\Gamma,\Gamma]$ is finitely generated, the set of such homomorphisms is finite. Hence some finite index subgroup $F''$ of $F'$ acts trivially on $[\Gamma,\Gamma]$. In turn, the $F''$-action on $\Gamma$ is by automorphisms that are the identity on the finite index subgroup $[\Gamma,\Gamma]$, and have the form $x\mapsto xu(x)$ where $u$ is a map from $\Gamma$ to $[\Gamma,\Gamma]$. Since it's an automorphism, we have $u(xy)=y^{-1}u(x)yu(y)$ for all $x,y$, and $u=1$ on $[\Gamma,\Gamma]$. Combining, we see that $u$ factors through $\Gamma/[\Gamma,\Gamma]$. So $u(xy)=u(yx)$ for all $x,y$. Taking $y$ in $[\Gamma,\Gamma]$ then yields $u(x)=y^{-1}u(x)y$ for all $x$; thus $u$ takes values in $Z([\Gamma,\Gamma]$, which in our case is central in $\Gamma$. So $u$ is a homomorphism $\Gamma\to Z(\Gamma)$. Again the set of such homomorphisms is finite, and we have proved finiteness of $F''$, hence of $F$. 

there exists an automorphism with no root of unity as eigenvalue there exists a diagonalizable automorphism with no root of unity as eigenvalue there exists an algebra grading in a torsion-free abelian group with $\mathfrak{g}_0=0$ there exists an algebra grading in $\mathbf{Z}$ with $\mathfrak{g}_0=0$ 

This is true (assuming as you do implicitly that all your division rings are nondiscrete). The reason is that for any nondiscrete locally compact division ring $\mathbf{K}$, the multiplicative group $\mathbf{K}^*$ of $\mathbf{K}$ has a unique maximal compact subgroup (namely the elements of modulus 1) and the quotient is either isomorphic to $\mathbf{R}$ (Archimedean case) or to $\mathbf{Z}$ (non-Archimedean case). Therefore $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbf{K}^*,\mathbf{R})$ is 1-dimensional, so all continuous homomorphisms from $\mathbf{K}^*$ to $\mathbf{R}$ are proportional. Multiplicatively, this means that every continuous homomorphism $f:\mathbf{K}^*\to\mathbf{R}_{>0}$ has the form $f(x)=\mathrm{mod}(x)^c$ for some $c\in\mathbf{R}$. If you require in addition that $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=0$, then necessarily $c>0$. 

If $H$ is a non-elementary subgroup, there exists a safe non-elementary hyperbolic quotient of $G$ such that the image of $H$ is all of $Q$. If $H$ is a virtually infinite cyclic subgroup, there exists a safe non-elementary hyperbolic quotient of $G$ such that the image of $H$ is finite If $F$ is any finite group, there exists a safe non-elementary hyperbolic quotient of $G$ containing a copy of $F$. 

For Q1: Every $f=\sum a_nz^n\in A$ induces a continuous function $\hat{f}$ on the closed disk of radius $1$ and $f\mapsto \hat{f}$ is a continuous operator (for $\ell^1$-norm $\|f\|=\sum|a_n|$ on the left and sup norm $g=\sum_{|z|\le 1}|g(z)|$ on the right), which in addition is multiplicative. The for $u(z)=z$, it is standard ($*$) from differential/algebraic topology that every $g$ close enough to $\hat{u}$ (the identity of the closed disk) in the supremum norm has a zero. It follows that $u$ (which is indeed $\delta_1=(0,1,0,\dots)$ is in the interior of the set of non-invertible elements of $A$. The same argument works for $z^n$, $n\ge 1$. ($*$) indeed if $g$ is close enough to the identity then it is homotopic to the identity, and if $g$ does not vanish, then we can deduce a homotopy from the identity of the circle to a constant map. 

Here's a sketch of proof (which intersects yours): Let $\Gamma$ be QI to NIL. As you say, by Gromov's theorem, $\Gamma$ is virtually nilpotent; let some finite index subgroup be a lattice in some simply connected nilpotent Lie group $G$. The growth of $G$ and NIL are equivalent, hence the growth of $G$ is $\simeq r^4$. Only two simply connected nilpotent Lie groups have growth $\sim r^4$: the abelian 4-dimensional one, and NIL. (This is a baby case of results of Guivarch or Jenkins in 1973) So either $\Gamma$ is virtually $\mathbf{Z}^4$, or it's virtually a lattice in NIL. To exclude the 1st case, you can invoke Pansu's 1983 paper but it's indeed a baby case: it's enough to show that NIL and $\mathbf{R}^4$ are not QI. But, NIL being endowed with a Carnot-Catheodory metric, both spaces are proper spaces with nontrivial 1-parameter groups of non-isometric similarities, so are isometric to their asymptotic cones. Since they are not homeomorphic, it follows that the asymptotic cones are not isometric and hence NIL and $\mathbf{R}^4$ are not quasi-isometric. Avoiding asymptotic cones, another approach is the Dehn function, which is $\simeq n^2$ for $\mathbf{R}^4$ and $\simeq n^3$ for NIL. Also, Roe proved later that for a simply connected solvable Lie group, the dimension is a quasi-isometry invariant. Note: While's it's not seriously needed here, Pansu's 1983 result is in general much harder because it describes the asymptotic cone for simply connected nilpotent Lie groups that are not Carnot, i.e., do not admit a Carnot-Caratheodory metric with a non-isometric 1-parameter group of dilations. It gives a description of the asymptotic cone up to bilipschitz homeomorphism, but to get strong consequences one has to combine with Pansu's 1989 Annals result, which says that the associated Carnot-graded Lie algebra (a purely algebraic object! no metric here) of a simply connected nilpotent Lie group is a QI-invariant. This allows to distinguish, for instance, some infinite families in fixed dimension. 

In the sequel, I assume that the ground field is any of zero characteristic, although this is probably not essential. As I mentioned in a comment, this means that $\mathfrak{g}$ can be endowed with a Lie algebra $\mathbf{Z}$-grading $\mathfrak{g}=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}\mathfrak{g}_n$ with all $\mathfrak{g}_n$ finite-dimensional and satisfying some complicated extra-data. We can forget those extra data and find Lie algebra having no such grading at all, to answer your question. First, trivial examples are Lie algebras of uncountable dimension. So I'll consider countable dimension, which is a reasonable restriction. I'll construct an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra with no nonzero grading at all (every Lie algebra can be endowed with the zero grading $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_0$). (If the field is algebraically closed, recall that a finite-dimensional Lie algebra admits no nonzero grading if and only if it is characteristically nilpotent, in the sense that its derivation algebra is nilpotent.) The construction of $\mathfrak{g}$ below has 2 building blocks: (a) a classical infinite-dimensional "filiform" Lie algebra (b) a 7-dimensional characteristically nilpotent Lie algebra (a) Consider the 2-generated, infinite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}$ with basis $(f_i)_{i\ge 1}$. Its nonzero brackets are $[f_i,f_j]=(j-i)f_{i+j}$. ($f_i$ can be represented as $X^{i+1}D$ where $D$ is the derivation operator on the polynomial ring $K[X]$). (b) Consider the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{e}$ with basis $(e_1,\dots,e_7)$ and nonzero brackets $12=4,14=5,23=24=15=6,13=26=54=7$ (where $ij=k$ stands for $[e_i,e_j]=e_k$). It is borrowed from the classification of 7-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras: it is denoted as $\mathfrak{g}_{7,0,8}$ in Magnin's list, and has the property that all its derivations are nilpotent ("characteristically nilpotent"). Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be the 2-dimensional abelian Lie algebra with basis $(a_1,a_2)$. We consider homomorphisms $\mathfrak{f}\stackrel{q}\to\mathfrak{a}\stackrel{p}\leftarrow\mathfrak{e}$ given by $f_i,e_{i+1}\mapsto a_i$, $i=1,2$, $f_j\mapsto 0$, $j\ge 3$, $e_1,e_4,\dots,e_7\mapsto 0$. Finally, $\mathfrak{g}$ can be defined as a subalgebra of the direct product $\mathfrak{f}\times\mathfrak{e}$, namely the fibre product $$\mathfrak{g}=\{(f,e)\in \mathfrak{f}\times\mathfrak{e}:q(f)=p(e)\}.$$ Denoting $g_1=(f_1,e_2)$, $g_2=(f_2,e_3)$, $\mathfrak{g}$ has the basis $$(e_1,g_2,g_3,e_4,\dots,e_7,f_i:i\ge 3),$$ where by abuse of notation we write $e_i$ for $(0,e_i)$, $f_i$ for $(f_i,0)$. Then in this basis, the nonzero brackets are given as $$[g_1,g_2]=f_3+e_6,\quad e_4=[e_1,g_1],\quad e_5=[e_1,e_4],$$ $$e_6=[g_1,e_4]=[e_1,e_5],\quad e_7=[e_1,g_2]=[g_1,e_6]=[e_5,e_4],$$ $$[g_i,f_j]=(j-i)f_{i+j},\quad [f_i,f_j]=(j-i)f_{i+j}.$$ (We could have defined $\mathfrak{g}$ directly this way but this longer construction directly shows, among others, that it satisfies the Jacobi identity.) For any Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$, consider the lower central series given by $\mathfrak{h}^1=\mathfrak{h}$, $\mathfrak{h}^{i+1}=[\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{h}^i]$. Write $\mathfrak{h}(n)$ for the quotient $\mathfrak{h}/\mathfrak{h}^{n+1}$. Note that $\mathfrak{f}^2$, which has the basis $(f_i)_{i\ge 3}$, is an ideal in $\mathfrak{g}$: it is the kernel of the (surjective) projection $\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{e}$. Consider a derivation of $\mathfrak{g}$ mapping $\mathfrak{f}^2$ into itself. It induces a derivation on the quotient $\mathfrak{e}$, which is nilpotent. In particular it induces a nilpotent operator on the 3-dimensional abelianization $\mathfrak{g}(1)=\mathfrak{e}(1)$. Therefore, the induced derivation of $\mathfrak{g}(n)$ is nilpotent for all $n$. We are going to check ($*$) that the 8-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{f}^3$ is characteristically nilpotent, ($**$), that $\mathfrak{f}^3$ (which has the basis $(f_i)_{i\ge 4}$) is a characteristic ideal (it is stable under every derivation). This granted, we can conclude: consider a nonzero grading of $\mathfrak{g}$. Since $\mathfrak{g}^i$ is a graded ideal, it induces a grading on the quotient $\mathfrak{g}(i)$ for all $i$. Also note that the self-operator $D$ acting my multiplication by $i$ on $\mathfrak{g}_i$ is a derivation, and ($**$) thus implies that it passes to the quotient $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{f}^3$, on which $D$ is nilpotent by ($*$); in particular it induces a nilpotent operator on the abelianization $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{g}^2$. Now on a nilpotent Lie algebra, a derivation which is nilpotent on the abelianization is nilpotent. It follows that $D$ is nilpotent on $\mathfrak{g}(n)$ for all $n$, but since it is also diagonalizable, we deduce that $D$ is zero on $\mathfrak{g}(n)$ for all $n$. This means that $D$ takes values in $\mathfrak{g}^{n+1}$ for all $n$. Since the intersection $\bigcap_n\mathfrak{g}^n$ is $0$ (that is, $\mathfrak{g}$ is residually nilpotent), we deduce $D=0$, which means that the grading is zero. Now let us prove ($*$) (taking for granted that its 7-dimensional quotient $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{f}^2\simeq\mathfrak{e}$ is characteristically nilpotent). It is enough to show that grading on $\mathfrak{h}$ is zero. Fix such a grading; its center is a graded ideal, with basis $(f_3,e_7)$, and $\mathfrak{h}^5$, with basis $(e_7)$, is also graded. So the center contains a homogeneous element of the form $f_3+te_7$. In the quotient by this element, we have $[g_1,g_2]=f_3+e_6=e_6-te_7$, so we get a 7-dimensional Lie algebra with the same law $[\cdot,\cdot]'$ as $\mathfrak{e}$ except $[e_2,e_3]=e_6-te_7$; changing the basis replacing $e_3$ with $e_3+te_6$ yields the same law as $\mathfrak{e}$. Thus the graded quotient $\mathfrak{h}/(f_3+te_7)$ is characteristically nilpotent. In particular the abelianization of $\mathfrak{h}$ has degree zero, which implies that $\mathfrak{h}$ has degree zero, that is, $\mathfrak{h}$ is characteristically nilpotent. Finally, let us check ($**$). Since $\mathfrak{e}^6=0$, we have $\mathfrak{g}^6\subset\mathfrak{f}$, and more precisely we see that $\mathfrak{g}^6$ has the basis $(f_j)_{j\ge 7}$. Then every derivation of $\mathfrak{g}$ stabilizes $\mathfrak{g}^6$, and therefore stabilizes the centralizer of $\mathfrak{g}^6$, as well at is double centralizer $\mathfrak{s}$. The centralizer of $\mathfrak{g}^6$, is equal to the ideal with basis $(e_1,e_4,e_5,e_6,e_7)$. Its centralizer, hence the double centralizer of $\mathfrak{g}^6$, is equal to $\mathfrak{f}^2\oplus\mathfrak{e}^5$ (where $\mathfrak{e}^5$ is 1-dimensional with basis $e_7$). Finally, we have $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{s}]=\mathfrak{f}^3$. 

Yes. Denote by $a,b$ the first two free generators of $F$. The case $w\in F\cup\langle x\rangle$ is clear. So we can suppose, after conjugation, that $w=u_1x^{n_1}\dots u_kx^{n_k}$ with $k\ge 1$, $u_i\in F\smallsetminus\{1\}$, and $n_i\in\mathbf{Z}\smallsetminus\{0\}$. Choose $n$ large enough such that the reduced form of $a^nu_ia^{-n}$ starts with $a$ and finishes with $a^{-1}$ for all $u_i$ that is not a power of $a$. In all cases, the reduced form $v_i$ of $a^nu_ia^{-n}$ starts and finishes with $a^{\pm 1}$. Then $q=\prod v_ib^{n_i}$ is a reduced form and hence $\neq 1$. We have $$a^{-n}qa^n=a^{-n}\left(\prod a^nu_ia^{-n}b^{n_i}\right)a^n=\prod u_ia^{-n}b^{n_i}a^n=w(a^{-n}ba^n)\neq 1.$$ Added: This actually shows that the canonical map $F\ast\langle x\rangle\to F^F$, $w\mapsto (t\mapsto w(t))$ is injective. Indeed this is a group homomorphism ($F^F$ being a group for the target operation: infinite power of the group $F$ by the index set $F$). Of course this fails when $F$ has rank $r\le 1$: for $r=0$, $x$ is the kernel, while for $r=1$ $axa^{-1}x^{-1}$ is in the kernel. The above shows injectivity of the projection to $F^X$, where $X=\{a^nba^{-n}:n\in\mathbf{Z}\}.$ 

Let $C_n$ be a cyclic groups of order $n$. Then the wreath products $C_2\wr\mathbf{Z}$ and $C_3\wr\mathbf{Z}$ embed QI into each other (for the reverse direction, observe that $C_2\wr\mathbf{Z}$ has a subgroup of index 2 isomorphic to $C_2^2\wr\mathbf{Z}$). But $C_2\wr\mathbf{Z}$ and $C_3\wr\mathbf{Z}$ are not QI, this follows from work of Eskin-Fisher-Whyte ($F\wr\mathbf{Z}$ and $F'\wr\mathbf{Z}$ for $F,F'$ finite groups are QI iff $|F|,|F'|$ have some common power.) 

In an attempt to prove this, I finally got the following counterexample. Fix $2\le n<k$ (for instance $(n,k)=(2,3)$, in size 5). Consider the subalgebra $R$ of $(n+k)$-square matrices of the form $$M(A,B,t)=\begin{pmatrix}A & B\\ 0 & tI_k\end{pmatrix},\quad A\in M_n(\mathbf{C}),\quad B\in M_{n,k}(\mathbf{C}).$$ For $x=M(A,B,t)\in R$, write $t=t(x)$. Then the rank of $x-t(x)I$ is at most $n$; in other words, $\mathrm{codim}(\mathrm{Ker}(x-t(x)I)\le n$. Hence for any two $x,y\in R$, $$\mathrm{codim}(\mathrm{Ker}(x-t(x)I)\cap \mathrm{codim}(\mathrm{Ker}(y-t(y)I)\le 2n<n+k,$$ so any two elements in $R$ have a common eigenvector. But $R$ has no common eigenvector: if $w=(u,v)\in\mathbf{C}^n\oplus\mathbf{C}^k$ where a common eigenvector, that $w$ is a common eigenvector for all $M(A,0,0)$ would imply $u=0$ (because $n\ge 2$) and that $w$ is a common eigenvector to all $M(0,B,0)$ would imply $v=0$. On the other hand, the result is true under some further assumptions, e.g., if $V$ is an irreducible complex $R$-module (clear since then $R$ generates the whole algebra of matrices), or more generally if it is a semisimple module (= direct sum of irreducible submodules). (Remark related to the original formulation of the question: in the above construction, if $k\ge n+2$ then the same proof shows that any two elements have a common eigenvector in the hyperplane $\mathbf{C}^{n+k-1}\times\{0\}$.) 

It's true: $\pi(\varphi)f\in L^2(G,\mu)$. Let $M$ be the support of $\varphi$, so $$(\pi(\varphi)f)(x) :=\int_M \varphi(g)f(xg) \, d\mu(g).$$ By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $$|(\pi(\varphi)f)(x)|^2\le \|\varphi\|^2_2\int_M|f(xg)|^2d\mu(g)=\|\varphi\|^2_2\int_{xM}|f(g)|^2d\mu(g),$$ so $$\int_G|(\pi(\varphi)f)(x)|^2d\mu(x)\le \|\varphi\|^2_2\int_G\int_{G}\mathbb{1}_{xM}(g)|f(g)|^2d\mu(g)d\mu(x).$$ Since $g\in xM$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $x\in gM^{-1}$, this yields (I should assume $G$ $\sigma$-compact to apply Fubini, but otherwise since $f$ has $\sigma$-compact support I apply it inside a suitable $\sigma$-compact open subgroup) $$\int_G|(\pi(\varphi)f)(x)|^2d\mu(x)\le \|\varphi\|^2_2\int_G\int_{gM^{-1}}d\mu(x)|f(g)|^2d\mu(g).$$ So $$\int_G|(\pi(\varphi)f)(x)|^2d\mu(x)\le \|\varphi\|^2_2\mu(M^{-1})\int_G|f(g)|^2d\mu(g)=\|\varphi\|^2_2\mu(M^{-1})\|f\|_2^2<\infty.$$ Note that I only used (twice) left-invariance of $\mu$ (in the non-unimodular case, the right-regular representation $\pi$ is not unitary, however). 

It's part of the Pirashvili exact sequence, relating Lie algebra and Leibniz cohomologies of Lie algebras. This is discussed (in homology terms) in the end of p2 of this paper of mine on Koszul's homomorphism (arxiv link). Pirashvili's paper is freely accessible here on Numdam; it's also written in terms of homology but the cohomological statement follows. 

Yes. A locally finite example is given as follows. Let $I$ be a totally ordered set. For a field $F$, let $G(I,F)$ be the group of (infinite) square matrices indexed by $I\times I$ with entries in $F$, that are upper triangular with diagonal 1 and finitely many nonzero entries above the diagonal. It is not hard to show that $I$ is generated by the $e_{ij}(r)$ for $i<j$ and $r\in F$ (matrix differing from identity only at $(i,j)$, where entry is $r$). Suppose that $I$ has a minimum $0$ and a maximum $1$ with $0\neq 1$. The elementary matrix $e_{01}(1)$ is central, so the center is nontrivial. If in addition $I\smallsetminus\{0\}$ has no lower bound and $I\smallsetminus\{1\}$ has no upper bound, the $G(I,F)$ is perfect. If $F$ is a field of characteristic $p$, then $G(I,F)$ is a locally finite $p$-group. If both $F,I$ are countable, then $G(I,F)$ is countable. Hence, for $I=[0,1]\cap\mathbf{Q}$ and $F=\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$, $G(I,F)$ answers the question. Note: I guess there also exist (less elementary) finitely generated examples, and probably even of finite exponent. A relevant reference could be (MR link, Russian version) Ashmanov, I.

VUZ) 29 (1985), no. 11, 65–82. [Edit: according this answer by Mark Sapir there are many Tarski monsters with nontrivial (even infinite) $H_2$ (I hope Mark can give more details where exactly this is proved and if, as we can expect, this can provide central extensions of finite exponent).] 

Thompson's group $T$ of the circle itself contains a copy of $F_2$: this is indeed easy to find a ping-pong pair starting from 4 disjoint intervals. That $T$ is non-amenable is even easier, because it does not preserve any probability on Borel subsets on the circle (immediate once we check that the only probabilities on Borel subsets of the interval $[0,1]$ invariant by $F$, are supported by $\{0,1\}$, and hence after identifying $0=1$ the only $F$-invariant probability on the circle is the Dirac at $0=1$, which of course is not $T$-invariant).
