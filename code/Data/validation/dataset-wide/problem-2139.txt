Did you make sure that expert knowledge in A is really necessary? It might be that they would like to get an expert, tried to find one for a while, and gradually reduced the requirements (internally - they will still ask for an expert officially) until even someone with at least a bit of experience is acceptable for the job. Sometimes you just don't find what you want, so you have to take what you can get. Just make sure that they know that your expertise in A is limited. If they still accept, fine. 

Just tell the dev lead how the desired process is looking. There is no need to make a fuss of it. Just something like 

While you can't (and shouldn't) do much to stop this - after all, the burden of prove would be upon you, as well as the problem to deal with an angry manager afterwards - it is advisable to be very careful concerning this guy. After all, if he is ready to blatantly lie on an online profile, he may also be able to blatantly lie about his (and thus, your) achievements in the company. For me, this would be a severe warning signal, and I would recommend to try changing the team, maybe even the job. Expect such sort of people to take advantage of you whenever they are able to. And him being friends with the VP, you will always be in an inferior position should any sort of conflict arise. 

As you already pointed out, this blurs the personal/professional border and is highly unprofessional. Moreover, it is absolutely not clear if such a practice session would really be extremely profitable or even profitable at all. Just a few thoughts: 

If you broke your arm, you can't carry heavy loads. If you broke your leg, you can't run quickly. Trying to do so will cause more harm than good. And it's not different for anxiety and depression disorders. This is an illness that needs a cure as well as a broken arm or leg. So tell your business partner about your medical condition. Get a doctor to examine this and give you an attestation of your condition (and of course also to help you with your ailment). Since you already tried to commit suicide, this is an emergency even if you feel you can currently avoid another suicide attempt. What would you have done if you had a severe car accident and had to stay in hospital for several weeks? Such things happen. Let your business partner be angry, that happens too. It is of no use to anybody if you end up dead from a successful suicide attempt. And even if you could avoid this and force yourself to work, the results will be of low quality. You may have a bad conscience now, but in hindsight, you will be glad that you took the break. 

As many others have said, no one will care whether you eat the company's catered lunch or bring your own lunch from home. But there's more to it than that. Based on your statements: 

It's your boss's job to decide what priorities are and when to cut losses. Sometimes the right thing to do is to discard completed work and shift directions. You might gently conclude that you either have a performance problem (too much waste due to thrashing requirements) or a communication/morale problem (the in-the-trenches programmers don't understand why their effort is being wasted/ignored). 

It's a great discussion question for friends or colleagues with mutual interests and experience, but a terrible interview question. Ultimately, asking this question will fail to generate information useful for making a hiring decision. It's similar to "show me a piece of writing you like." If a question this broad is posed in a no-pressure circumstance, like chatting with a new acquaintance, you could go in so many directions: the funny children's book you read last night with your daughter, the magazine article about the Greek debt crisis, the easy YA book you took to the beach, or your favorite work of classical literature. No matter which way you go, you can have a nice discussion with a someone--but if you talk about children's books, your new friend isn't going to learn anything about your ability to grapple with the themes of Moby Dick. Presupposing that a candidate can show you the code and remain relatively nonplussed (see footnote, the stress imposed alone should make the question non-productive), your conversation could touch on one or more of the following (but not all!): 

You deserve to be heard and your bosses probably want to listen. That doesn't necessarily mean that they'll change everything all at once, but that's okay too. Your job satisfaction is down as a direct result of the move, so you should bring it up in your one-on-one. You shouldn't be expected to sit there and smile while your situation becomes demonstrably worse. You can frame it as, "Boss, I know the move made sense for the entire company, and I'm not saying it was a bad idea, but for me personally, there are many parts of it that are bumming me out." If you are the only one who has issues, not a lot will happen. But you're almost certainly not the only one. If you're all adults communicating honestly, you, your coworkers, and your managers are probably going to come up with some creative ideas for adjusting to your new environment. Maybe your office can try longer lunches, modified commuting policies, occasional catering, different furniture arrangements, heavier furniture, telework, etc. It'll probably take some trial and error. None of that can happen if you have a culture of forced-smiling. 

That would be a stupid move by your manager since he could just ask you directly to take up these other responsibilities. There are many reasons why the current situation is as it is. Maybe the manager thinks that your workload is higher than it actually is. Maybe they want four eyes instead of two for the job. Maybe there currently is just not enough work to do for you and your co-worker. Who knows? But it is not your job to do management decisions. More important are the following questions: 

Choose your battles wisely. Changing the policy on your own and only for your team will provoke feelings of resentment ("Why are we the only ones that have to deal with this?"). The more so if the company values flexibility and the employees share this value. Note that normally the policy is there for a reason. You are not the only one that might face this problem, and obviously they decided that the upsides outweigh the downsides. And what could you win? The problematic situation has never arisen up to now, and it might never arise in the future. Also, only very limited damage would be done, since a sudden absence due to illness is something that always has to be considered, and someone being not there for a few days should never be a show-stopper (or the planning is questionable). Also, if you know in advance that day X will be a critical day, you can emphasize this in front of your team. This will greatly reduce the chance of someone taking that day off and forgetting to tell you (I assume no deliberate troublemaking here, only accidental slip). Bearing that in mind, I simply would take the risk. And if the situation should really occur that someone is on vacation and would have been needed on-site, you can afterwards still implement a new rule for the team, referring to the actual events. The acceptance in this case would be much higher than for a rule that relies on theoretical events. Of course you can just implement the rule, it is not really a big thing. It is just that the battle is not worth it, and you might need your (political) credit differently later on. 

If so, have a talk with your manager. But don't try to optimize the work load of your co-worker, even if in best interest. 

And even if it works out, you might be in a situation where this manager sees you as owing her for getting the job and urging you to do other questionable/unprofessional things later on in return for the favor. Thus, my clear advice is: Decline the offer politely. Not only for reasons of professionality, but also in your own best interest. 

No. Just No. Even small companies are not tied up that way. If it is very probable that the company is better off in one or two months, where is the problem of hiring additional programmers now? It's only two months, right? Hiring a programmer for additional two months is roughly the price of a new compact car, so something even an individual person like me could pay, much less a company. If they don't do this, it is very likely that in a month or two nothing will have changed. They just suffer from ridiculously bad management, letting the situation go on for seven months or even more and not replacing the developers (didn't they tried to take back the old ones?). And they obviously placed all the weight on you and didn't care about it anymore. I have seen such situations once or twice in my life. They never went well. If a company is run with this amount of disregard concerning the health and well-being of the employees, and still being on the verge of bankruptcy, it is only a matter of time until everything breaks down. Just don't make the mistake of the gambler, who thinks that surely, after the next game everything will come out better. That might be, but chances are great that everything just gets worse. And this is such a case. If your job is of such great importance that the existence of the company depends on it, they really should have gotten some more programmers months ago. Any reasonable management would have done this even in tight financial situations. If they rather chose to exploit their employees until they burn out, they deserve the shutdown. 

This one is interesting. You need to genuinely answer the question, "why do I care?" Is overhearing the conversation a waste of your subordinates time? Then tell Joe you'd like to move this conversation to a different place to avoid wasting their time. Is overhearing the conversation going to confuse your subordinates? Then definitely tell him you'd like to move the conversation to avoid confusion. Are you worried that others will get the wrong idea about you? Try to relax and realize you can't control other people's feelings toward you. Maybe he's wrong. Maybe he's right and you should change. Maybe he's right but changing would be too costly at this point. Learn what you can. 

I think you and your boss need to have a better understanding about your expected role in meetings. Let's say you're the Sharepoint technical expert. When you are meeting with customers (or "customers") about whether or not to use Sharepoint, the customers can't/won't care about what the Sharepoint expert has to say until after they've actually agreed that using Sharepoint is the correct course of action. Why are you going to these meetings? 

I understand how incredibly frustrating this can feel, but if a customer doesn't believe that your technology is the answer, your specific technical expertise is irrelevant. If early on your team is pigeonholing you as the expert (deliberately or accidently), this could be undercutting your persuasiveness. Bottom line: You should talk to your boss and team about meeting expectations. 

There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on you, and it depends on the company culture. Don't muddy the issue with talking about macronutrients, or almost-vegetarianism, or food morals, or bringing your lunch from home sometimes--no one is going to have issues or questions about that. Figure out what the company's expectations are, decide how often you'll want to leave, decide how important your lunchtime breaks are, and try to gauge whether you and the company will be a good fit. 

It sounds like you're in proximity to a somewhat toxic situation, you're pretty low on the totem pole, and your boss(es) don't particularly care about this problem. You also say you don't want drama. How can I distance myself from these people while maintaining professionalism? You don't have to. Your other coworkers aren't going to automatically lump you in with the clique. They probably already know all about the obnoxious behavior. As long as you don't join in their conversations or go to lunch with them, they won't see you as part of that subculture. Even if, you started associating with them throughout some portion of your first 5 months but have since stopped, your adult, professional coworkers won't hold it against you. They understand that you were still figuring things out. You don't have to give anyone an obvious cold shoulder nor any other elaborate theatrics. If a clique member sends you a nasty IM or makes a rude comment, simply respond noncommittally and don't pursue the conversation further. The clique members will stop making overtures, meanwhile no one who's watching will care.
