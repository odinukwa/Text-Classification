I prefer the cycling lore that it was decided by which gear of a Citroen 2CV you needed to be in to drive up the hill/mountain. For HC climbs you had to go up them in reverse. Scientific? Not so much. Perceived Gallic? Mais oui! 

Then pack everything up & go home drinking a protein shake thing that I make. I also have the option to go the gym during the day, which I have been doing just to do a bit of stretching and mainly use the foam rollers. So, as a vegetarian, what would be a good plan of what to eat and at what times in order to deliver myself to the start line as full of energy as possible? Races are all about 35 miles. 

Disconnect Ultegra caliper. Drain hose - or can you get like stopper or bung to keep the oil inside? Attach string to end of hose and pull back through (or some other method to help guide the new hose back through the frame) Disconnect SRAM caliper Drain hose? Or again can you plug it somehow? Easily feed hose through frame in one go without getting cross Install caliper & connect hose Bleed brakes 

Edit - same course but ridden with power meter: I raced the same course again, here are the same graphs from strava. It was a much windier day, and my finish time was just under 3 minutes slower than the last race. 

In short, you can't. I find turning my head to the side a bit reduces the noise a bit in one ear, but you can't do this all the time. A rear view cycle mirror may help you. 

Bikepacking tends to be more lightweight and generally doesn't involve panniers or racks. Just look at the rigs used by tour divide riders ($URL$ If you think you need pannniers, then perhaps you are talking about touring rather than bikepacking. Bikepacking luggage will typically require one or more of the following: 

You can cut the skewer, but be sure to leave enough thread on there to keep the nut on when the QR is opened enough to take it off your bike (without having to remove the nut). Don't forget to file the sharp cut edge smooth afterwards. 

Depending on design, try ensuring all bolts are tightened evenly (so if the top two are done up all the way and the bottom two are not, undo them all and redo them evenly) 

I have a modern bike (ridgeback meteor '13) and It currently has a 21 speed shimano chainset. I find that going down hills (which I do a lot) and on flats I need a higher gear. Can I do anything to get a higher gear ratio (such as a bigger large chainring) or am I already at the top? Spec: 48/38/28 Chainrings 12-32 (7 Speed) Cassette: 

EDIT (adding some points raised in the comments): This way of turning left is typically a safe and easy way to turn left on crowded crossings, even if you're not very familiar with roads. The biggest danger is cars turning right and running over you when you go straight on the first leg - that's the same as when you go straight and unfortunately omnipresent in Germany, not only on crossings like these. If you're confident to do it, you can probably also turn left on the car lane - it might be a bit of a hazzle to reach that lane, I'm not sure how legally evil that is, but it's probably not too problematic if you know the crossing. I cannot judge how much of an obstacle you'll become for cars turning left - I think it's two lanes turning left in parallel. In my experience you're meant to do the 90° turn before coming to a stop in Germany, and after the stop in Switzerland; such that in your case you just accelerate straight once the second traffic light turns green, that's the position for which the traffic light should be adjust. PS: on the top view you can also see similar waiting places for coming from the south on Berliner Straße and turning left into Im Neuenheimer Feld; and with lane marking, the way to go from the north into Jahnstraße to the east. 

I have a CAAD12 disc with Ultegra, but I prefer SRAM, so I have got some nice new Force levers & calipers that I need to fit. This is my first experience with disc brakes. The front setup isn't a problem, as the cable is all external, but the rear brake is a bit daunting as the hose is internally routed. Another concern is that the SRAM levers come ready connected to the calipers, with the fluid already in them. The steps as I see it are: 

Note how the chain is going over the little bit of metal, rather than under it like in this image here: 

I have a carbon framed bike with a press fit BB. Recently the non-drive side bearing disintegrated, and having the Park tool to remove/install the cups I thought I'd be good to go. The drive side cups popped out no problem, but the non-drive one had frozen solid in the way that aluminium seatposts can in carbon frames. Despite hammering it like all bezoomny, to the point where bits of metal were breaking off the inside of the shell where the tool rests against, it would not budge. In the end I got a dremel and very very carefully cut through the remaining bearing shell and then the BB cup, and it still took some pretty good whacks with a hammer against a wooden drift for it to finally give up. So, get the right tool, or take it to an LBS/mechanic who does. Its surprising how easy the cups can pop out when done properly. Failing that, and as a total last resort, you can cut them out with a steady hand. 

This sort of setup is especially useful for off road/trail riding as weight is kept to a minimum and storing your heaviest items stored at the bottom of your frame bag will keep your centre of gravity low and improve handling. Something not so important in touring 

My free hub body has cracked and im looking to replace it. I have discovered it uses a 14mm hex key to remove. I cannot find a freehub body for sale that matches m785. Will a "m760-m765" body fit my "m785" hub? 

One for every removeable or adjustable part on your bike (including tyres). With the exception of those you will be unable to repair/fix on the trail, such has hubs and bottom brackets. They need not all be combined with one tool though (sometimes individual tools can be lighter) 

You will find (usually an allen/hex key) bolt on the brake pad itself. Loosen that, align your brake pads then re-tigthen. You may also need to adjust again on the bars to get it to fit. You will also find it easier when loose and aligning them, to pull the brakes right up to the rim and tighten the bolts. Everything you need to know you will find here: $URL$ 

One tip I have picked up to avoid cars passing so close is to ride further away from the kerb (but not so far you're hogging the road and then drivers get annoyed). This seems to have some pycological effect on drivers to give you more room. I can't explain it, but found it to work in most cases. I have also seen bikes with mirrors fitted and some sort of plastic distance keeper (a pole that sticks out with a reflector on, I would imagine this needs to break if a car hits it.) 

I've seen these advertised recently: $URL$ You can lock them without using the key, and allegedly they are super mega secure. 

I have a CAAD12 disc which I'd like to fit SRAM Force 22 hydraulic to. I've been a bit enthusiastic buying things without really researching all the pitfalls of the different bits and bobs that go into disc brakes and compatibility thereof. So, it turns out that the CAAD12 fork is post mount, but my calipers are flat mount. Is there an adapter to fit a flat mount caliper to a post mount fork? 

I bought a power meter. I understand that you should do an FTP test to work out your threshold. But until I have time to do this, could I take a reasonable guess from a recent 35 mile road race? These are the graphs from Strava, for the estimated distribution, it says average 230W. Is this a good starting point? Or should I go higher or lower, or should I ignore the graphs because Strave is just trying to guess it from speed/hr. 

I've joined a local road racing league, it's lots of fun. I'm pushing myself and breaking lots of PBs in the process of trying not to get dropped (which I inevitably do). As well as the craft of racing, I'm also learning about the logistical side of holding down a full time job and transporting myself + bike + kit to the various venues in time to sign on, get set up & get some time in on the rollers before briefing and race start. So, currently my timetable for the day looks like this: 

You're meant to cross the crossing in two steps (you'll need two traffic light cycles to turn left, not like cars who manage in one cycle). I took the road names from here, which is, I think, the crossing you were photographing. Starting from Jahnstraße, you go straight (on the right of the lane) along with the cars coming from Jahnstraße. Arrive at the holding line I marked in red . (And see all the cars with the same destination as you, cruise off over the river while you wait). Now you're standing in front of the cars going along Berliner Straße facing south. For the second step, the small traffic light you highlighted is relevant (and the way these crossings are meant to be used, from this position it should be visible, but they are commonly misadjusted, don't know why, but it seems they see less maintenance). It's purpose is to give you a small head start ahead of the traffic queueing up behind you in Berliner Straße. This is why it's so short green, it's only for the few people getting packed in this short term "parking spot", it is not meant to be caught by flowing traffic. In addition to the headstart, it's meant to tell you when Berliner Straße has green - there's no way you can see the main signal. EDIT: as top view (image from google maps) 

It could be a number of things. The most likely it sounds as if your cable is sticking/jamming. Try replacing your cable and cable housing. This shouldnt cost much for DIY (read up on how to do it, you dont want to crush the housing when cutting), but would cost more from a mechanic. I would firstly check that your deraileur isnt out of alignment and/or loose or bent first. Another thing you can do is check that you have the right chain for your cassette and that the chain isnt worn (a cheap tool will check this for you). If your mechanic has not solved this, I suggest trying a different one. 

You can go as tall as you like. Have you seen those tall bikes that people must climb up a ladder to use? However practicality is another thing. As the comments have said - enough room to stand-over is a good start. Try getting a bike-fit, adjusting certain geometry (saddle hight, stem etc) may help in your circumstances. 

There are a lot of things you could do that would make it difficult to make a speedy getaway. Anything that would hinder you would also hinder a thief. 

I would reccomend against this. It only takes 10 seconds to hop on a bike and make off. Although some suggestions come to mind 

I have two bikes, a hybrid commuter with skinny tyres, full mud guards & rim brakes, then I have a 29er hardtail MTB with hydraulic disc brakes and off road tyres. Which would be best, for commuting (with a minimum modification cost) in the snow? (this is likeley to be a small-medium amount of snow, perhaps having been compressed by other vehicles/walkers)
