I want to understand how weaponry and armor might be made from the chitin of giant insects, and how well it might work. Background In a fantasy world I'm working on, a significant population lives entirely underground. Naturally, a great deal of the plant life is parasitic (non-chlorophyll-based), and insects are a very large segment of the animal life. Some insects come very large indeed: gigantic beetles of various kinds are fairly common, semi-domesticated (as well as wild) animals. Not that they tame especially well, being stupid, but they're not terribly aggressive and they breed fast. Weapons My particular focus here is bows. It seems to me, from observation of the shells of lobsters and whatnot, that you should be able to laminate together sheets of chitin to make powerful bows. I do wonder, however, whether lamination is necessary at all. If it is, I wonder where the glue is going to come from. Armor The same properties that could make chitin good for bows would surely make it excellent for armor. It's light, flexible, and frighteningly strong. But I'm sure it also has real negatives in this area, be it difficulties of manipulation and fabrication, or problems in actually getting the stuff to work well as armor. Question Are these uses of chitin plausible? What more do I need to know -- or do people in my fantasy world need to do -- to make it work? {Note: My suspicion is that a solid answer is going to cover the implicit sub-questions easily without wandering endlessly afield. If that turns out to be incorrect, I will happily ask for closure and restructure as multiple questions.} 

Harem Dynasties Start with the assumption that, unless someone intervenes, women can bear an upper-average of about 10 children. That is to say, if for instance a woman is treated as a brood-mare from the time she is best able to bear children, she’ll average 10 live births. This is a very rough estimate, of course, but it’s plausible enough. If I have thirty wives in my harem, and I strive to keep them all pregnant as often as possible, I’m going to have 300 children. That means 9.7 votes, and I control them all. What’s more, if I raise my sons to behave the same way, and convince 80% of them to help build our family dynasty, then by the time I’m 80 I’m going to control something on the order of 1000 votes. You, meanwhile, with your silly monogamy, will not control more than 5 votes in the first stage, and chances are your wife won’t let you get that far. Even if she does, you’re not going to get more than 15 grand total with all your sons on board. Daughters For Sale If you allow women to be treated as brood-mares, daughters and sons will also be valued quite differently. Among the creepy power-lords, with their harems, daughters are a valuable trade resource. Sons, by contrast, have to be raised to maintain the dynasty, which means education and a strong sense of privilege. So I have my wives raise my daughters in the compound, while my sons—once they are of an age where they’re even vaguely worth talking to—get shown enormous respect and granted all kinds of privileges. (Take a look at how pre-modern Korean society worked, especially among the elites, for an example of how this sort of thing goes.) Once my daughters are of age, I trade them to other elite power-lords to bulk up their sons’ harems, and they do the same for me. Not that I want some other lord to have more votes than I do, but let’s face it, his interests and mine tend to lie in the same direction. What we don’t want is those awful monogamous peasants getting any real power, now do we? Uh Oh So the point is, the system can be gamed pretty drastically, and once it gets this way, there’s no undoing it: the people with the power to do anything want it to stay. I suggest preventing any kind of poly-marriage, for a start. Cap the number of votes per marital unit at 5 (preventing brood-mare situations). I’m not sure this society is going to have the positive results you’re looking for, but your question about gaming the system was specific and clear. 

If I understand the question correctly, you’re asking how you as a worldbuilder might go about developing a flavorful, plausible, not-insanely-unwieldy timekeeping system. In addition, it appears that the various societies in your world more or less agree about the system. What follows are some practical suggestions for something of a step-by-step, noting a number of the more significant choices you might make along the way. There are other ways of doing this, of course—this isn’t a question that can be answered definitively—but I hope this may be helpful. Sexagesimal Thinking As several have noted already, sexagesimal numbers are exceedingly convenient for quick calculation, because 60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This naturally lends itself to divisions of 12 & 5, thus the division of our clock face into 12 blocks of 5 minutes, our 12 months of the year, and so forth. I suggest that you keep to something like this. The obvious alternative is a lunar calendar, as traditionally used in China and its broad area of influence (among other places), but you have to understand it clearly enough that you can use it fluently and fluidly in passing conversations among characters. A further point of pragmatism: since your readers will almost certainly assume a sexagesimal solar calendar and timekeeping system, the only reason to draw a great deal of attention to your system is if it is much different. And yet, if you already had a great idea for how the weird calendar system was going to be a big deal in your world, you wouldn’t be asking this question. So I think what you want is window-dressing on a sexagesimal system. It’s easier for you and for the reader. The Twelve Start by coming up with an arbitrary list of images or objects to fit the 12 Zodiac signs. They don’t have to be animals: they could be plants, for instance. I think it will be a bit easier for the reader to follow if you are consistent (all animals, all plants, etc.), but there’s no reason you have to do it this way if you prefer not. It may be convenient and elegant to come up with a sort of story in which each of the 12 signs leads naturally to the next. This can also provide extensive flavor-material for mythology and whatnot. For the sake of high precision, cut each item in three parts: head, body, tail; blossom, stem, root; etc. It needs to be clear to you which end comes first. You now have a complete system of decans. These label every ten-degree arc of a complete circle: lion-head, daisy-stem, etc. Under normal circumstances, however, everything will be labeled by the main image (hour of the lion, month of the daisy, etc.). Cutting the Year The year is traditionally cut at the four “corners”: the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the summer and winter solstices. These are very readily observable with a low level of precision necessary, and have been known around the world since Neolithic times. The only reason to remove them from your calendar is because you have some clever idea about that—in which case, again, you’d not be asking this question. So we can assume that the year has four corners. Now you get more choices: 

In short, what are the fundamental elements of religion, and how should I go about constructing them coherently and plausibly as I design a religion for a culture in my world? 

Contact among tribal peoples in the Americas can in many cases be understood to partake of this kind of thinking. Myths, for example, drift from place to place over centuries and millennia, but there is no sense in which one tribe normally claims to have "the right answer" or "the real story"; rather, it is a matter of, "that's not how we tell that story." How religious systems drift and spread in an environment like this is highly complex and unpredictable. In essence, once system A is in contact with system B and the translations are made, you may have a situation in which aspects of A gain popularity among nominal B members. There could be any number of reasons for this: a charismatic figure's espousal, miracles, good luck, political fortune, etc. In any event, the older B system becomes something of an admixture. Since such contact is very often mutual, operating through ordinary trade and communication, you might well end up with a common AB mix, or A, A', B', and B, or any number of alternatives. In some cases, such mixed or semi-imported cults may take on a mystery-cult, initiatory aspect, in which the "true" knowledge about the divinity is claimed to be older, purer, or whatever. Again, there is no particular reason to think that any one way this might run is most likely. For instance, the Greek mystery cults were heavily inflected by Egyptian material because of the incredible age and prestige of that civilization, but this is not to say that the Orphic or Mithraic cults were "really" Egyptian and more than they were simply "Greek." Perhaps the best advice I can give, concretely, is that one sheer off from the notion that people are or are not really members of this or that religion. That kind of strong identification traditionally happened only when there was some kind of exterior political pressure to do it. For instance, in the third century CE, in Egypt, census information makes clear that the vast majority of ordinary Alexandrians and such thought of themselves as Christians. (Note: there is no special reason to think that people would identify themselves falsely in this instance.) And yet, it is also clear from the archaeological record that these people made extensive use of adapted ancient spells, essentially, "Please, O Mary and Isis, help me get through this pregnancy well," with ritual actions again a mixture of Christian and Egyptian usages. If asked, I suspect these people would genuinely say what they said with the census: they're Christians. But they don't see any reason why this means they shouldn't keep calling on Isis as well -- why not? Remember: strong exclusionary measures (believe what we say and only what we say) are very much the exception rather than the rule in the history of religions. The problem is that we live in an era dominated by such thinking, and thus we assume everyone always thought that way. They didn't. 

The Effects As to gross effects, my guess off the cuff is that you’d get a lot of fog. I went looking at things like ocean temperature, dew point, air temperature, and fog. I found that you get fog when the air temperature and the dew point get within a couple of degrees C of one another. This happens a lot in the morning because the air temperature bottoms out before sunrise while the dew point keeps rising until the sun gets going to dry the air out (that’s my rough-and-ready interpretation, anyway). It looks to me as though ocean temperatures have a lot to do with dew points at sea, but I haven’t found any good indication of how that relationship works. Looking at the Caribbean, where the ocean is pretty much always 72-74F, the dew point 55-70F, air temp 65-80F, it looks to me as though the ocean temperature is sort of the crossing-point. That is, you get fog when the air temp is about the same as the water temp. If that’s correct, then raising the water temperature during a battle by 2-5C (=4-9F) is going to have a huge effect. If I’m at all in the ballpark about the relationship of water temperature to dew point, a heavy engagement at noon in the Caribbean is likely to be enveloped in a very thick fog, and remain so for quite some time. My Preliminary Answer Therefore, my preliminary answer to my own question is: In a heavy engagement, the ocean temperature will rise by 3-5C in the immediate vicinity of the firing ships, and no more. The gross effect of this will be more or less heavy fog. So here’s my question to you: Am I doing this right? Reality check, please? [Please note: If you wish to debate my math about the ships and their metal, i.e., whether I have my facts straight about broadside weights and muzzle velocities, I’d prefer that this go in the comments. I’m pretty sure I’ve got that straight, and if I don’t, it’s largely incidental to the question I’m asking.] 

Contrary to popular opinion, there is no reason human society is intrinsically misogynistic. If, as you say, your society makes a conscious decision to attempt to avoid that fate, they’re likely to succeed. Let’s run through some particulars. Physical Force and Equity Societies do not, as a rule, run on physical force. If you have a society that is working relatively smoothly, especially if the society has generally agreed that peaceful coexistence is preferable to continual violence and danger, then you’re not going to need a great deal of violence to get things done. Indeed, violence will quickly come to be indicative of serious problems to be dealt with. The crucial point is that the society must hold the respect of the large majority of its members. Because each of us is individually associated with the collective, crimes against individuals appear, from the perspective of each individual, to be crimes against society as much as against individuals. This nullifies the “not my problem” effect that is so crippling in, for example, much of today’s United States. In essence, the notion of obedience to law—don’t kill, don’t steal, don’t rape, etc.—must rest on mutual social respect rather than on fear of punishment. In real life, we don’t just attack others and steal their stuff, nor does it usually occur to us to do so. This is because we respect the society of which we are members, and we recognize that the same respect is therefore due to other members. The notion that intensive, violent policing is absolutely necessary to prevent people turning into psychopaths is a sick fantasy, albeit a popular one. Most tribal societies do not have police systems at all, for instance. So we can set one point aside: although women will tend, all things being equal, to lose physical fights with men, this has very, very little to do with whether they will be treated as second-class citizens (or worse). But What About Farming? Look up rice, the world’s most popular crop. Who plants and harvests it? Who maintains it in the paddies? Why… women and children? Huh. Apparently the notion that farming is automatically men’s work is a chauvinistic fantasy too. Now rice is not an ideal crop in all circumstances, but it’s a very good one in many. This is because while the total labor put into it is perhaps higher than with some crops, that labor can be stretched out over long periods of time. In addition, it tolerates a fairly wide climatic range. An interesting effect of a constant-labor crop like this is that children become remarkably valuable in the short term. You can certainly put an 8-year-old to work in the paddies without feeling you’re being cruel. The obvious example is water-cycling. You have a simple pedal mechanism (you can surely scrounge that from the wreckage of your apocalypse, or just build your own like the Chinese have for many, many centuries) with paddles or a water-screw. Put the bottom end in the lower paddy and the top above the upper one. Now pedal. The idea is to move water from the lower to the upper, slowly, in a controlled way, thus mitigating against the constant effects of seepage. Since it turns out that you get better crops the more precisely and constantly you do this, your children become valuable members of your farming society very soon. Individualism One big concern that tends to come up in these things is an evaluation of what any given person can or cannot do on his or her own. Certain kinds of back-breaking labor seem to require men, because only men have the upper body strength to do it themselves. But this is a nonsense. To begin with farming. Rice, once again, points to another essential issue for your society: collectivism. Everyone gets rice equally. It’s not my paddy, my rice, but our paddies, our rice. But this point expands greatly. In our little town, Frieda makes furniture, Warren does weaving, Delilah is great at dying, and Charles makes cheese. When we sit down to a meal, do we celebrate Charles because he’s the most useful? Well, only if we’re crawling on the floor naked. Otherwise, everyone has contributed. And the same goes for Betty the baker, Sam the sausage-maker, and so on and so forth. This should be obvious. If you have a balanced, planned society, you draw on the skills and talents of each individual. All those abstractions about upper-body-strength and whatnot fail in the face of real life. Charles, for instance, is built like a gorilla… but there was that childhood accident, and he can’t walk without crutches. So do we send him out to do farming because he’s got a penis, or kill him because he’s not “whole,” or do we enjoy the cheese? In fact, almost nothing that has to happen in the village is intrinsically sex-divided. Interestingly, however, some tasks are likely to become so. The trick is to avoid this being seen as a matter of superiority on one side or another. Take weaving, let’s say. Anyone can do it—there’s no special strength or whatever involved. But in many communities through the ages, weaving became a female activity. Why? All kinds of local reasons, few if any now recoverable. But once you’ve established a situation like this, it tends to perpetuate itself. In essence, what happens is that a whole bunch of women get together to talk while they work. And they talk about what interests them, of course. And, as everyone knows perfectly well, if you get a bunch of women together to talk about whatever they feel like talking about, the conversation will tend over time to become woman-oriented. I don’t mean that women talk about mothering and menstruation and so forth all the time, only that women and men do tend to have socially-distinct conversation patterns in any given society. From a male perspective, the women may be gossiping or whining or whatever, but then again, from a female perspective the analogous male conversation is a bunch of grunting, fart jokes, and penis-waving. Neither is true—but these conversations do tend to be sex-restrictive. Now once weaving becomes a female activity in this sense, you’re going to see men somewhat disinclined to join, because they feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. (As a side note, I wonder whether your postapocalyptic equal society will be open about those gay men who do feel more comfortable in such social circles, and have them join the weaving.) Meanwhile, there are going to be analogous “male” activities: baking, let’s say. If in our society baking becomes a very masculine, even macho activity, what will happen? Pretty soon, they’ve probably got this whole thing going about how bread is a woman who has to be pressed into shape (or a breast to be fondled, etc.), and sweat, and heat, and columnar phallic ovens, and whatever. Now I choose baking for the simple reason that it does require considerable upper-body strength, it’s hard work, and in many societies the bakers—especially if part of a collective that includes threshing and milling—are male. But also because lots of societies deem any form of cooking intrinsically female. The point should be clear: sex-division with respect to labor is not about intrinsic abilities or the nature of any given task, but about social construction. Provided you want to end up with equity across the sexes, you need to make sure that people value cloth as much as they do bread (and so forth). Equity and Law I suggest that you start with the assumption that law, in the strong sense, will be a minimal issue in your society. Not only is constant policing not necessary most of the time, but all the complexities of contracts and so forth are irrelevant to your postapocalyptic society. Furthermore, you have a problem working out what sort of law to depend on in the first place. Common law, a la Britain and the US, depends on precedent, which means a vast library of case law. But in your postapocalyptic society, has such a library been preserved well? Who’s maintaining it? Do the people generally trust the lawyers to do this? They don’t trust lawyers now, so why would they in the future? Inquisitorial law, as in France, has the advantage that at least it’s answerable to truth instead of precedent and opinion. And yet, the principal force preventing rampant abuse is very strong hierarchical submission: this court doesn’t abuse its power because the next higher court will crush it brutally if it does. We cannot count on a system like this in our broken world. There are other possibilities, of course, but my point is that legalism simply isn’t a good place to begin planning. So what does this mean for women? It means that women must be equal citizens in actuality and not merely in law. It means, to put that another way, that you can’t build your society by simply trying to legislate the morality you want: you have to build a society that works. How It Really Works On the Farm Women can carry babies on their backs while doing an awful lot of farm work, from planting and harvesting rice to mucking out or feeding livestock. Children over about 6 months do not need continuous breast-feeding: they can eat “solid food” and be topped up with breast-milk whenever convenient. Children who don’t have to breast-feed constantly can be carried or watched by men just as well as by women. As social planners, you’ll want to focus on crops that are long-term sustainable in a number of senses. You don’t want to destroy your fields, certainly, but you also want crops that work well collectively. Rice is an obvious example, but there are many others. Corn is an interesting case: the planting is a brutal couple of days where everyone pitches in, and then there’s harvesting, drying, storage, and so on. But there’s also this weird thing that corn crosses very fast, and the only way to prevent this (or to do it on purpose) in order to keep the best corn for the future is to hand-pollinate. People have been doing this in Mesoamerica for thousands of years. And no, it doesn’t require men: it requires patience, intelligence, and care. Ultimately, your farms will center around collective labor. In the Village If you’re planning a society, you must insist that pure individualism is in fact selfishness. Everyone must cooperate in the face of the apocalypse, or all will suffer and die. Tasks can be sex-divided, as noted above, but their worth cannot be constituted in this way. When you find that hunting is considered more valuable than cooking, and hunting is done by men and cooking by women, this tells you that the society is sexist, not that there is any intrinsic connection between these tasks and these sexes, nor that there is any intrinsic superiority of one task over the other. I suggest that you emphasize the village collective is the centerpiece of your society, because it allows for a great deal of planning while granting enormous latitude for local particularities. At Home Since any and every task can be apportioned however a society wishes, there is no reason that home life has to be different from this. The first thing to realize is that “home” and “family” are social constructions as much as anything else. There is no reason whatsoever to think that humans naturally live in married couples. Marriage, or anyway preferential bonding, does seem to be enormously more common than other arrangements, but that does not mean that husbands and wives must live together in private spaces. So you have a spectrum. At one end, have the women live together in one kind of longhouse and the men together in another. Couples have private communal spaces they can use for intimacy, physical and otherwise, at will. Life centers around the village, and there are certain spaces in the village that are especially central to communal existence. At the other end, have couples live together in private spaces whose boundaries are impermeable. Your mother-in-law may never, ever come to visit: after the first day, when she comes to inspect to be sure her son isn’t marrying some dreadful hussy, she’s forbidden to enter the marital space. Communal and private life are sharply divided. Humans have existed happily everywhere along this spectrum. No part of it requires or assumes that women are inferior to men. Conclusion One of the remarkable things about human beings is that they do come up with an amazing variety of different ways of doing things. Another remarkable thing is that they have a strange habit of claiming that their way is the only way because of nature. Pretty much everything you hear about how men or women have to this or that is of this kind: it’s social construction. Ideology, to put it another way. Women get paid less in US society because the society is inequitable, period. There is no other justification. (This doesn’t mean it’s easy to fix, of course.) Women do the cooking in most traditional societies because that worked out to be rather convenient when somebody has to stay home with the kids and somebody has to go out hunting. But this isn’t the way nature is, it’s just how things tend to fall out. If you look at nomadic societies, for instance, you’ll find that this sexual division doesn’t always work thus. And now that the members of your society understand what is and isn’t actually required by physiology, they’re also not bound by traditional assumptions.
