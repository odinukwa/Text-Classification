You will typically find that CCD cameras are sold separately to the telescopes. That way the telescope can be used visually or for astrophotography, by either fitting an eyepiece, or a camera. Most telescopes do ship with eyepieces, as they are much less expensive than a CCD and it is sort of expected, but most observers will typically replace this eyepiece with a better one anyway, so to all intents and purposes, when you buy a telescope you are just buying the Optical Tube Assembly and maybe a mount, and you add to that all the accessories you need to accomplish your objectives. Different CCDs will be used for different purposes, for instance planetary observations or deep space objects. That telescope has a fork mount. Note that this constrains how much equipment you can put on the end of the telescope without getting in the way of the mount. It also is an Alt-Az mount, which means it is not polar aligned; stars will rotate in the field of view, requiring a field de-rotator in addition to a CCD. It looks like a nice enough scope for visual observations, but if you are interested in astrophotography, you might want to hold off for a bit, maybe get a scope for visual use first, and maybe make use of well-set-up robotic astrographs that you can hire over the internet, like slooh.com and itelescope.net - get some experience using premium gear that you don't have to worry about setting up or maintaining, and while you do that, work out what gear you will be happy about getting for yourself. The fact you are asking this question about CCDs suggests you aren't yet ready to spend money on astrophotography gear... Getting set up well for visual stuff can set you back hundreds... Getting set up for astrophotography can set you back many thousands, so you want to be well equipped to make good purchasing decisions. And you can rent a lot of time on some pretty good telescopes for that same $... 

However, movement of the camera or poor seeing resulted in the light being spread more between the pixels, the calculations of the differences between adjacent pixels would be different: 

You probably will have difficulty imaging Ly$\alpha$ from a z=1.7 quasar at 330nm. Says P. Veron: The lower limit [z=1.8] is set by the ultraviolet transmission of the atmosphere... between 3300 and 3600Ã…. 

Don't worry about the main telescope. There doesn't have to be a relationship between the focal length and f ratio of the telescope and the guidescope. I think this is proven by the use of off-axis-guiders, which use the same focal length as the telescope. They just come with the headache of finding guide stars. What is important is: can the guidescope provide data for the controlling software to accurately automate the telescope? You want a wide, fast field of view, so that you are guaranteed to be able to find a bright star to guide by. You want a camera on the guidescope that has sufficiently small pixels that the guide star that gets picked will at least cover a few pixels - the more the better. To some extent, this conflicts with the wish for a wide, fast view, as that will result in smaller stars on the sensor. This can be mitigated by ever so slightly de-focusing the guidescope so the stars form fuzzier, larger circles on the sensor. What is more important that the focal length of your telescope will be: (a) what the limit of your seeing tends to be, and (b) the accuracy with which your mount can be controlled, and (c) how accurately the guiding software can place the guide star (usually a fraction of a pixel - use maybe 0.2 pixels as a worst case, if unknown). There is not much point in being more accurate than the seeing permits. The formula for figuring out how much each pixel sees is: $$ px_{fov}=206*px_{microns} / f_l $$ where f_l is the focal length of a telescope and px_microns is how large each pixel is on the sensor. You can therefore estimate a suitable focal length guide scope this way: $$ f_l = px_{microns} / (res_{seeing}/G_{acc}) * 206 $$ where px_microns is the size of the sensor pixels, res_seeing is how accurate you need the guiding to be, G_acc is the guider software's centroid accuracy (use 0.2 as a worst case if unknown) 

There are many other variations on telescope designs others than the ones you have mentioned. They differ in the light path, the shape of the optics utilised, the use of mirrors and/or lenses, and the physical structure. A Schmidt-Cassegrain is a particular type of Cassegrain reflector. A Cassegrain reflector uses two mirrors, a primary and a secondary. Both are curved, and the secondary is placed in front of the primary, which blocks some of the light to the primary. The primary directs light onto the secondary, and the secondary directs light through a hole in the centre of the primary. This 'folds' the lightpath, resulting in a short telescope, even at quite wide apertures. A Schmidt-Cassegrain is a Cassegrain with particular design details. The primary mirror has a spherical curve, and the secondary usually has a spherical curve, though some manufacturers modify the design with a parabolic secondary to improve the performance. A key characteristic is the addition of a lens to correct for the optical aberrations produced by the spherical mirror(s). This lens is also used to mount the secondary mirror, so no vanes are required to hold it in place. A Galilean telescope is a refractor, and so it uses lenses exclusively instead of mirrors. Lenses may be able to out-perform mirrors, but it is easier to manufacture high-quality large mirrors than large lenses. Newtonian telescopes are also reflectors with two mirrors, but one is flat. It also blocks some of the light in the centre of the objective, but it is held in place by vanes instead of a lens. The flat mirror angles the light out the side of the telescope near the objective end of the telescope. While this may frequently place the eyepiece in a more convenient position to access it, especially when aiming near the zenith, it is also necessary to rotate the telescope in the mount to get the eyepiece in the right place. There are pros and cons to all telescopes, and selecting a telescope requires knowing what you will be doing with it, and choosing something that complements that purpose well with its pros, and that has cons that are not relevant. 

These are the Langrangian Points $URL$ -you'll find an explanation of the maths at a variety of sources if you search using that. 

Any causal claims or associations relating to language use are never going to be able to be proven, so the best answer to your overall question is: "nobody knows". You can use Google's ngram viewer to visualise the appearance of a specific term or terms over time. Perhaps astronomers generally have been better as a field in making their research more approachable by not pitching their discoveries in superior-sounding high-falutin sesquipedal pomposity. But it isn't universal; for every approachable 'Hanny's Voorwerp' there is an ancient-language-originating label like 'heliosphere'. Geologists also use non-latin terms like "slip" and "fault" and "hanging wall". Is that to make geology more approachable for mass-media public reach-out PR? 

The moon's rotation plane would precess (more) in the same direction as Earth's rotation, if the Earth spun faster. 

The score, that is the sum of the squares of the differences, for the first (perfect) image is 520200. The score for the blurred image is 304200. Therefore the sum of the squares of the differences between adjacent pixels suggests that the first picture is the better one. This strategy isn't perfect, obviously. The presumption is that better images will exhibit a better score due to larger differences between adjacent pixels, but this is an assumption. The squaring of the difference is intended to provide greater weight to larger differences, but I came across a comment on the PIPP support website that says that PIPP has modified the basic algorithm to give still greater weight to sharper contrast changes over lower contrast changes - so maybe squaring the differences isn't enough sometimes. Apparently this quality measurement strategy doesn't work when the object is small in size on the sensor, and may be bright or even over-exposed. The above methods may select blurred and smeared frames over frames that are actually better. In this case, a strategy that looks at the histogram of values for the frame and selects the one with the higher peak, may produce a better selection of appropriate 'best quality' frames. It assumes that the histogram will have a higher count of frames sharing a pixel value across a smaller range, rather than spreading the light out across a wider range of pixel values. An alternative quality measurement strategy simply adds up the values of all the pixels in an image. A higher score will indicate more light got through to the sensor, which implies that less cloud (for instance) got in the way. 

If you are asking 'Why is Mars so small in my Field of View, I thought it would be larger' then you need to consider how big you can expect to see it for various eyepieces. Right now (2014 03 06) Mars is approx 12.6 arcsec in apparent size. It can be as big as 25 arcsec, and as small as 3 arcsec. (Why the variation? We orbit the sun at a different rate to Mars.) What is your field of view? Well, for a 2800mm focal length telescope and if your 40mm focal length eyepiece is a Celestron Plossl, then your true field of view will be about 3/4 of a degree (0.74 deg). That is 2664 arcsecs. Mars will therefore cover 0.0047 of the field of view. That isn't big. 0.5% of the diameter of what you see in the eyepiece. So, it will be barely more than a pin-prick. If you had a Celestron 7.5mm Plossl, for a magnification of 373x, then the true field of view for that combination with your telescope would be 0.14 degrees, or 504 arcsec. Then Mars will cover 0.025 of the field of view, or 2.5% of the diameter of the view. So if you mentally divide the field into 10 equally sized stripes or rings, Mars will cover about a quarter of one of those imaginary divisions. Still not big, but a lot bigger than what you are currently seeing. You could try going bigger using a shorter focal length eyepiece, but 400x is about the usable limit. Sorry, you aren't going to get an eye-piece filling view of Mars, not unless you're riding on the Mars Global Surveyor. To use the equipment to get a picture of Mars that will impress your friends, you might try getting a camera with a small chip with a nice fine pixel size to record video frames. These you then 'stack' using software to remove the noise that comes from various sources including atmospheric refraction variations, and you end up with an image that is often quite impressive, and orders of magnitude better than what you can perceive with the naked eye.
