In case of Question 1 (modified), it might happen that both are not factors, e.g., consider the sequence ...1111010000.... 

No, I claim that the set of $d$ unit vectors, $e_1=(1,0,\ldots,0)$, $e_2=(0,1,0,\ldots,0)$, $\ldots,$ $e_d=(0,\ldots,0,1)$, along the axes can be shattered, except that for every $\mathcal H$ either the empty set, or all $d$ of the won't be in any $h\in \mathcal H$, so the VC-dimension is $d-1$. (For similar reasons, it cannot be $d$ for any point set.) Indeed, if $\mathcal H$ is the opposite of the cone spanned by the above $d$ vectors, i.e., the all-negative hyperoctant, and $h_I=-\sum_{i\in I} e_i$, then $f_h(e_i)=0$ if and only if $i\in I$. 

No, there is a counterexample. Take a circle, whose diameter is slightly larger than 1 and put |A|-1 points evenly around its boundary and the last point to its center. This set will be 1-separated, but no matter how you partition it, the part containing the center will not be 1-separated. 

Suppose we have a sequence $d_i<2n$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$ and we want to select $n$ disjoint pairs from $Z_p$, $x_i,y_i$ such that $x_i-y_i=d_i \mod p$. Then how big $p$ has to be compared to $n$ to do this? I am primary interested on an upper bound on $p$. Is it true that there is always a $p\le (1+\epsilon)2n+O(1)$? My comments. It is trivial that $p\ge 2n$ because all the numbers $x_i,y_i$ must be different and $d_1=1, d_2=2$ shows that this is not always enough. I also guess that it helps if $p$ is a prime, maybe the smallest prime bigger than $2n$ works which would answer the question. 

In a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, $J$-holomorphic curves are special minimal surfaces if $J$ is compatible with the symplectic structure and the metric is induced by $\omega$ and $J$. Minimal surfaces satisfy the monotonicity property, i.e., if $S$ is a minimal surface passing through $p$, then for $r$ small enough, the area of $S \cap B_r(p)$ is at least $c r^2$, for some constant $c>0$ depending on the metric. This property can be used to prove, for example, the removal of singularity of $J$-holomorphic curves, and also, the diameter of a $J$-holomorphic curve cannot be arbitrarily large if the energy (area) is bounded. In Gromov-Witten theory, one also consider perturbations of the Cauchy-Riemann equation, as $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$, for other reasons. If just to prove removal of singularity, we can view the graph of a solution as a holomorphic curve in $\Sigma \times M$ (if domain is $\Sigma$), with respect to some almost complex structure on $\Sigma \times M$ depending on $\nu$. But my question is, if $\nu$ is sufficiently small (in $C^0$, for example), can we prove a monotonicity result for a solution $u$ to $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$ (but not its graph)? I suspect this holds because for $\nu$ small, a solution should be close to a real $J$-holomorphic curve. 

Maybe some of the following statements are not precise. Please correct them. Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold. Let $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ be a Morse function. Then a generic Riemannian metric $g$ satisfies the Morse-Smale condition: for any two critical points $p$ and $q$, the unstable manifold $W^u(p)$ of the negative gradient flow of $f$ of $p$, and the stable manifold $W^s(q)$ of $q$ intersect transversely. Trajectories of this flow that connect $p$ and $q$ will approach to them exponentially. Now suppose $f$ has a degenerate critical point $p$. Let $q$ still be a non-degenerate critical point. Assume sufficient genericity, $p$ is then of "cubic type", i.e., near $p$, $f$ can be written as $f(x) = f(p) + x_1^3 + \sum_{j\geq 2} \pm x_j^2 +$ higher order terms. Now it seems to me that the unstable set $W^u(p)$ won't be a manifold in general, but a stratified space, with the top stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ polynomially(because there is a degenerate direction), and a lower stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ exponentially.(Is $W^u(p)$ necessarily a manifold with boundary?) And now, to ask about the transversality of $W^u(p) \cap W^s(q)$, it should be in a sense of stratified spaces. Is there any original paper that discuss this transversality? I know that Floer has two(maybe more) papers: The unregularized gradient flow of the symplectic action; Morse theory for Lagrangian intersections, which talked about the transversality about non-transverse Lagrangian intersections. Indeed his argument can be carried out for Morse theory. I wonder if there is any more original and more elementary argument about this transversality? 

This is a well-known puzzle/problem, the trick is to make an injective mapping from any set of disjoint tacks to triples of $\mathbb Q^2$. 

This is my updated answer, probably still wrong somewhere... If $A(i,j)=\lfloor (i+j)n/10\rfloor $, then the matrix is symmetric and satisfies strict inequalities if $n$ is at least $10$. Also $A(a_2,j)-A(a_1,j)=(a_2-a_1)n/10$ (plus/minus 1, if you want integers and round the $A(i,j)$'s) and since $b_2-b_1\le n$, we get that $D(R)\le 10$. 

If for some collection of open sets $\cup_{i\in I} (A_i \cup^* -A_i)=\mathbb S^d$, then is there an $x\in \mathbb S^d$ and $i_1,\ldots i_d\in I$ for which $x\in A_{i_1}\cap \ldots \cap A_{i_d}$? Important that the question implicitly requires $A_i\cap -A_i=\emptyset$, as $\cup^*$ denotes disjoint union. Also note that I want $x$ to be in $A_i$ and not in $-A_i$, otherwise a suitable version of this statement would follow from Ky Fan's theorem (which implies it even in this form for $d\le 2$). Of course this problem is very similar to the Lyusternik-Shnirelman variant of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, so I'm sure this has been studied, but I could not find it anywhere, what of course makes it less likely to hold, which I nonetheless believe. 

Suppose that we have a 2d-regular graph whose edges are colored such that the edges of each color form a cycle of length 2d. (So if the graph has 2n vertices, then there are n colors.) Is it true that there always is a perfect matching containing one edge of each color? Remarks. For d=2 there is a simple proof by Zoltan Kiraly who also invented the above formulation of the problem. I even do not know the answer for d=3.

Below lie the remains of my initial (awkward) answer. This is only a long comment. Let $R$ a be unital ring which is not necessarily commutative and let $R^{\times}$ denote the set of left-invertible elements of $R$. We say that $R$ has property (U) if for every finite cover $R^{\times} \subset \bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i$ of $R^{\times}$ by subsets $A_i \subset R$, there is at least one index $j$ such that $A_j$ contains two left-invertible elements $\lambda, \mu$ satisfying $\lambda - \mu \in R^{\times}$. 

Given a ring $R$, let us denote by $L(R)$ the lattice of two-sided ideals of $R$ for which the infimum and supremum are given by $\inf(I, J) = I \cap J$ and $\sup(I, J) = I + J$. Such lattices are complete and modular. If $R$ is a principal ideal domain (see original MSE question/answer) or if $R$ is the ring of integers of a number field [3, page 135], then $L(R)$ is distributive. The following claims classify the lattices of principal ideal domains (PIDs). 

Hint: If $\,^tASA = S$ with $\det(A)= -1$, then show that $\text{Tr}(A) = 0$ and $A^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Then reduce the case when $A$ is upper triangular. If the above conditions hold, the $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-class to which such an $S$ belongs is called an ambig class (sic). This is also what John Robertson calls an ambiguous class in [2]. From this source, we get 

This is a little embarrassing, but it turned out that not even a (non-rainbow) matching is guaranteed to exist. The problem was solved on this workshop by a number of people, presented by Tamas Terpai. They raised the same question for bipartite graphs, for which a matching must always exist. 

I don't think that there can be such a selection function $f$. Define $A_i$ through independent events $C_i$ and $D_i$, each of which occurs with $50\%$ chance, as follows. $A_1=D_1$ and for $i\ge 2$, if $C_i$, then $A_i=D_i$, otherwise $A_i=A_{i-1}$. If $A \in \bigcap_n \sigma(A_n, A_{n+1}, ...)$, then $P(A) = 0$ or $1$ should hold, with a similar proof as for the Kolmogorov Zero-One Theorem. On the other hand, no $A_i$ and $A_j$ are independent. 

A counting argument proves that there is a (dense) graph whose embeddings always have a $C_4$ in convex position (with possibly intersecting edges). I am sure that a more careful counting would also prove several copies of convex $C_4$'s without intersecting edges. The proof is a counting argument, we can describe every graph that has an embedding without a convex, induced $C_4$ with less than $n^2/2$ bits. Firstly, there are $n^{O(n)}$ order types (which describe the position of the vertices in the embedding), so encoding an order type requires $n\log n$ bits (we don't care about the constants). Divide the vertices into $n$ groups of size $\sqrt n$ such that every edge is in at most one group (this is possible, again we might lose some constants). In each group, there are $k=\log n$ vertices in convex position. So we know that there cannot be an induced $C_4$ among them. There are only $2^{k^2/4}$ such graphs. So the edges can be described with $k^2/4$ bits instead of the usual $k^2/2$, this means that in each group we spare $k^2/4$ bits. Thus in total we win $nk^2/4$, which is about $n\log^2 n\ge n\log n$, we are done. Note that this proof works for any graph instead of the $C_4$. 

When considering the heat kernel of a Schr\"odinger operator $$- \Delta + V(x) $$ where $\Delta$ is the standard Laplacian on ${\mathbb R}^n$ and $V$ is a nonnegative potential function that has nice behavior at infinity (proper, grows polynomially), one usually sees the term $$e^{-tV(x)}$$ and the asymptotic expansion of the Gaussian integral $$\int_{{\mathbb R}^n} e^{-t V(x)},\ t \to 0.$$ If $V(x)$ is homogeneous, namely, $V(rx) = r^\alpha V(x)$, the above integral is just a power of $t$ (in particular, no log term). However it seems that in more general case when $V(x)$ is not homogeneous, for example, when $$V(x, y) = V_1(x, y) + V_2(x, y)$$ which is the sum of two homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, the expansion may have $\log t$ terms. Question: What is the general form of the asymptotic expansion of this integral as $ t\to 0$? 

I think the recent work by Huagui Duan and Yiming Long $URL$ showed the existence of at least two closed geodesics. 

Let $(M, \omega)$ be a symplectic manifold and $G$ be a compact Lie group. Suppose we have a Hamiltonian $G$-action on $M$, with moment map $\mu: M \to {\mathfrak g}^*$. We assume that the moment map is proper in case $M$ is noncompact. The question is: for any loop $\gamma: S^1 \to G$, and a point $x\in M$, is the loop $t\mapsto \gamma(t) x$ a contractible loop in $M$? So we assume neither $G$ or $M$ is simply-connected. We may assume that $\gamma$ is actually a 1-parameter subgroup of $G$, generated by a vector $\xi \in {\mathfrak g}$. In the case $M$ is compact, we restrict the moment map to this subgroup, which is equivalent to a real valued function $\mu_\gamma$. Then the gradient flow of this function should push the loop to a critical point, which is a fixed point of this subgroup. Hence this shows that the loop is contractible. Now if $M$ is noncompact, the gradient flow doesn't necessarily converge to a critical point (could escape to $\pm \infty$). Note that the real valued function $\mu_\gamma$ is not necessarily proper. So the above method fails. But I still guess that the loop should be contractible. Is there any proof or counter-example? Or should we add some conditions to guarantee this? 

The answer is yes. Indeed, free associative algebras over a field are more generally $GE$-rings [Theorem 3.4, 2]. This fact has been used by Bass [1] to prove that a finitely generated projective module over a free algebra with coefficients in a PID is free. By contrast, free commutative algebras over a field, i.e., polynomial rings over a field aren't $GE$-rings if the number of indeterminates exceeds $1$ [Proposition 7.3, 2]. (I have made this remark in another MO post). We recall below the definition of a $GE$-ring in the sense of P. M. Cohn and we give subsequently a proof of the claim. Let $R$ be an associative ring with identity and let $E_n(R)$ be the subgroup of $GL_n(R)$ generated by matrices obtained from the identity matrix by replacing an off-diagonal entry by some $r∈R$. Let $D_n(R)$ be the group of invertible diagonal matrices; note that it normalizes $E_n(R)$. A ring $R$ is termed a $GE_n$-ring if $GL_n(R)=E_n(R)D_n(R)$. The ring $R$ is a $GE$-ring in the sense of P. M. Cohn if it is a $GE_n$-ring for every $n > 1$. Let us turn to the proof of the claim. Let $S$ be the free monoid on $\{x, y\}$ endowed with the shortlex order, i.e., words are ordered according to word length and words of the same length are ordered lexicographically. Then $S$ is a bi-ordered monoid and it is not difficult to show that $F\langle x,y \rangle = F[S]$ is an integral domain with unit group $F^{\times}$. Let $\varphi: S \rightarrow \omega$ be an order-preserving bijection. The following lemma is instrumental.
