I remember back in ~2001 I was very serious about this topic -- trying to experience first-hand. Back then I already did ~3 years of the non-attachment practice, as a result I no longer identified myself with my thoughts, but I still could not see how the watcher and the thinker of thoughts was not real. The way I got first-hand experience of "no-subject" was through meditation on "chitta-vritti" or the train-of-thoughts process. I was watching my thoughts very closely, trying to see where they come from... and how they dissolve... As I kept watching, I saw that thoughts do not really dissolve, instead they are slowly replaced by the next thought. When I focused on this process of replacement of one thought by the next, I realized that the very "I who is watching this process" was in fact nothing else but the next thought itself(!) 

Here's another perspective. My core practice and a teaching that got me into Buddhism was radical annihilation of ego. I suppose normally it is considered an advanced practice but that's what I got from day one. Murder the ego. No egoistic thoughts were allowed, no defending self, no saving face, no looking better, no emotional revenge, no congratulating oneself on achievements, no feeling superior - none of that stuff that normal people do to feel themselves strong and whole was allowed in my life. Don't ask why. In the hindsight I'm not sure I wish anyone go through that, but I must admit it was very effective. Having no room for ego takes away the clear goal behind all decision making, and forces oneself to always try and evaluate everything from different perspectives. It requires one to always try and be perfect, without ever feeling entitled to own position. Traditionally, ego is considered the biggest obstacle to Enlightenment. Not because accepting anatta is some sort of requirement. Not even because un-identifying with "I" removes the context in which death could apply. It is mostly because ego is the very tangle of attachments and illusions that we are trying to liberate from. The act of maintaining a consistently flat social image is the opposite of opening to one's true multidimensional nature. So when Buddhist teachers shatter one's social image, they only do one a service, by helping destroy that which holds one down like an anchor. Now, I don't say it's not painful. But you have to understand that pain and humiliation is not the point. It's not that ego is killed by making one look bad or feel bad in front of others, that's just a side effect. Ego is murdered by shattering it's consistent model of the world (and by implication, consistent idea of oneself as a person, cuz the two are related like mirror and its reflection). Those models cannot always be explained away. Oftentimes the teacher does not have time or energy or conceptual vocabulary to deconstruct one's illusions step by step. It could take years, like it does sometimes with therapists you know. Instead, Buddhist teachers take karmic responsibility for playing a tribal surgeon and causing much pain, with the hope of helping one break out of the box. So please, focus on your model of the world and image of self, and not on humiliation. Feeling offended will only serve to lock you in your own prison. The more someone gets enlightened, the more difficult they are to offend or humiliate, because they get so round and fluid that there's nothing to grasp them by. Enlightened people are so down to earth and no nonsense, and can navigate situations so well, that they are never even in a position when they can be embarrassed, because they don't get attached, they don't fight themselves into a corner. In this sense they seem like the simplest and most normal people you ever met. Authentic and comfortable in their own skin, regardless of circumstances. Why don't we try to imitate that rather than getting offended? 

As my teacher explained (sorry, this looks silly, but I always have to start my answers with something like this, since I'm not quoting texts but none of this is my invention), there is a difference between a desire (aka "should") and an intent (aka "will") Desire is a point of inner discontent. Half of you is here, without girlfriend, and the other half is there in your imaginary future, with girlfriend. This split creates inner conflict that leads to the feeling of wrongness, mental/emotional suffering. Intent is a case of inner integration and inner peace, based on unbending determination. All of you is here. You have thought about your goal, you have determined the best possible course of action (such as doing something; or not doing at all - i.e. waiting; or exposing oneself to spirit and chance; or being oneself authentically) and now you're living it with no back thoughts and no hesitations. Because you are like this, there is no inner conflict, there is no mental/emotional suffering. 

I spoke before about the power of narratives. Narratives is how our mental world is shaped, narratives is one of the main ways to control the sukha/dukha mechanism described in the Four Noble Truths. In this case, mental noting is a special case of narrative. By looking at thoughts and emotions in a certain way ("in and off themselves" as Buddha said in Satipatthana) we create a special philosophical narrative in which the thoughts are things of a different order than they are in our regular everyday context. We look at them neutrally, philosophically. Hence the dissociation effect. However, mental noting is just one way to do narrative. The idea is to be the master of your thoughts (via control of the context / frame of reference) instead of being driven by your thoughts (being locked in a certain context). So don't fall in the same trap with your positive experiences, you don't have to shape it in a way that does not induce positive states of mind. You are totally free to create any sort of narrative (assuming it is true, not harmful, and does not go contrary to Dharma) - as long as it drives you up. In fact the whole point of the First Jhana is to learn to control your mood via narratives (and then directly, in the Second Jhana). 

"How the enlightenment feels like" It feels like you jumped off the airplane and are falling, so it is scary at first, but then you realize that this falling never ends, so you can go anywhere you want. <== this is a metaphor for the inner state, living without self and with complete suchness and spontaneity. "How it helps a man." It helps because you are not stuck in mental boxes, so you are basically more mentally flexible than most people, which makes you more effective at solving all kinds of problems. You also don't have an inner emotional conflict, so you don't live in that state where you have to suppress half of your feelings. Which makes you strong in action, confident, and always in good mood. "How their mind works and reacts to the situations." See the above. Their mind has no attachments, so it is a very open, very flexible mind. But also very clear, it gets things "in nano-second" with little or no explanations, it sees connections between things. It is also mind that sees things from multiple perspective at once, because it is not limited by ego with its single perspective. Also, it is mind that has tremendous will power. It chooses which way to go, and creates its own reality. It is master mind. "How important is enlightenment to a man." In my opinion, without enlightenment life is fake and pointless. Without enlightenment you are either completely unstable, rolling downhill with bad karma, or everything is half-lukewarm and mediocre and you live in a state of perpetual inner conflict, weak and burned-out. Or you get excited sometimes, and then fall down. Without enlightenment life is a promise that always betrays. "Do we need to meditate more hours to gain enlightenment or Meditate effectively to get enlightened." Well meditation helps a lot, but you also have to be very sensitive to clues and put some effort into collecting the pieces of the puzzle and assembling it. It's like you have to read between the lines of what Buddhist teachers say, and see how it maps to your own life. Dharma is like a guidebook that explains the terrain in words. You read it and then when you walk the actual landscape you try to recognize the points from the guidebook in real life: "oh, that's what they meant; oh that's what they spoke about" - this is the main effort. 

They create a structure, the game rules, within which the practice may take place, and They dress the naked truth in some feathers to make it more presentable to a normal human practitioner. There is some charm in the ancient mystique, don't you find? 

In my understanding, the objective of metta cultivation in Pali Canon Buddhism, is to counter, to be an antidote, for the attitude of negativity, hatred, and envy towards the world. Such negative attitude hurts its bearer first of all, but it also creates objective problems with interaction. This works on the principle of this/that conditionality. Holding a grudge against the world ("that") we are holding to a certain attitude and outlook in ourselves ("this") and vice versa. This configuration is stable and self-sustaining. It contributes to the injured condition of its subject and is an obstacle to Liberation. It also functions as root of harmful karma. By cultivating metta we deconstruct our habitual image of "that", and this through inference relieves our attachment to "this" with its suffering. In Mahayana metta is part of a broader concept called bodhicitta. Bodhicitta is this attitude of altruistic drive, attitude of a winner who now has no fear and no personal goals but still has a sense of accountability because he knows and he sees. In Mahayana we're not trying to counteract anything, we're "using result as path". We simulate Buddha's qualities with the objective of becoming Buddha through assimilation. And to simulate Buddha's qualities requires one to genuinely care about other beings, the way Buddha does. I agree with you in your assessment that to see women as sexual objects, or to see them as mothers or even as however they happen to currently see themselves -- is all equally limiting. In all cases we project a flat image on a multidimmensional phenomena. This sort of projection is the very attitude of samsara. In my opinion the spirit of Metta/Karuna is nonjudgmental acceptance. Instead of having a flat view of the other person, we see them from many possible angles. We see good in bad, bad in good, we see them as victims of circumstances and previous karma, we see them as masters responsible for their lives, we appreciate that they are doing their best, we appreciate their limits, we see their suffering, and the same time we see that they in fact in some sense are happy with their lives and not willing to change them. We see all sides of phenomena in its complexity. We also appreciate the fact that we may not have all information, we may be basing our view of the person based on our own guesses and stereotypes. When we have all of the above, we enter a state when we can't really judge a person, since we no longer have a firm basis for judgement. Instead, we enter this state of absolute acceptance and kind tolerance. We no longer take the person in isolation, we see them in context of their circumstances, and there is nowhere to place blame anymore. We can't even feel pity for them anymore - indeed who are we to assume that they are pitiful? And yet we can't help but feel their pain, and maybe even marvel at how they're handling it. This is what metta looks like to me, as absolute multidimmensional nonjudgemental acceptance. Sort of like modern humanistic liberalism on steroids. Which is why I have hope that in 21st century this perspective will strengthen and become mainstream thinking. 

Somewhere in SN or AN there was a sutta that explained it this way: (citing from memory, can't find the reference) Most people approach debate as if it was a sword fight. They debate to win, as if losing meant death. They do not make any effort to understand the other person's perspective! They keep on fighting until they see an opening in the opponent's defense. As soon as they see a little inaccuracy or a logical error, they happily grasp on that -- even if it does not change the main idea the other person is trying to convey. When the other person gets confused for a moment and says something obviously wrong, they happily make fun of him and keep pushing until the opponent is completely lost. This kind of people firmly hold their ground, their confidence coming from their limited perspective and narrow view. Having won another debate with aggression and cunning, they are proud of themselves. But if they see they cannot win, they get very envious of the winner, they get nervous, start changing topics, lie, resort to personal attacks, get angry, and finally go down to rudeness and yelling. Instead, the noble students do not debate, they have conversations. They discuss things. When they thus sincerely talk they try to see each other's perspective. They understand that each (truthful) perspective is valid from its own side. So they try to see the value of the other perspective, and appreciate the factors and conclusions of the other side. Then, by combining the two perspectives, they come out with a more complete, more thorough understanding of the original problem. Each side lets go of its attachments and delusions as it accepts the other side's point of view, and integrates them together. 

External emptiness ("form is emptiness") means: the apparent objects of the so-called physical world are not real entities. There are no real boundaries between objects, and as the time goes and the elements mix and recombine, there are no identities carried over from moment to moment. All objects are imputations of the mind. If we start with any form (a generic object of thought) and engage into analytical decomposition we will never find any stable reference point; everything is defined against of, and in terms of, something else. In other words, phenomenal reality is an illusion, or in modern terminology, what we naively assume to be reality is but an interpretation we make. Internal emptiness ("emptiness is form") means: and yet, through the power of dependent-coarising, phenomenal reality spontaneously exists. In other words, the illusions are manifestations of the ultimate reality; our mind with its interpretations is a result of beginningless process. Our mind with all its experiences and emotions is but an interplay of forms. So not only all forms are empty imputations of the mind, the mind itself is empty interplay of forms. Finally, absolute emptiness is the Liberating Realization, what Gotama Buddha called "the final knowledge". According to Chogyam Trungpa, "Absolute emptiness means that there is nothing particularly to do. There is nothing to work on, no one to make a reference point, nothing whatsoever." Yet another way to explain the same progression is the Four Emptinesses of Completion Stage Meditation: 

According to my Zen Master, you must never meditate under influence of any drug. We even had a little sign at the entrance of zendo, that warned about this. The same rule applies to alcohol, and if Master caught you drunk, or even in hangover, he would kick you out right away. Although unlike the drug rule, the alcohol rule is more of a disciplinary thing. They don't want people to lose their sense of boundaries. These were the rules for lay people, who did not take the five precepts. I don't see why these would not extend to home. 

No you did not. The spirit (in an abstract sense!) brought you and the butterfly together. You played your role, butterfly played its. Was your intent pure? Have you felt the sacredness of the moment? Were you acting foolishly or have your weighted the possibilities? Life and death is around us and inside us all the time. The fact that butterfly was on your right is a good sign. Life gives us chances once in a while, sometimes it's a chance to change someone's life - and sometimes it's a chance to have someone change our life, to be in the role of the butterfly. At the end of the day we are not Gods - we can't foresee all repercussions of our acts, even such simple ones as yours. But we can do our best, and if we do it consistently then in the long run we will all be in the best place we could have possibly been.
