I lost about 10kg. At the beginning, i was able to burn more calories because of the extra 10kg. If I carry a backpack of 10kg with me now while using elliptical cycle, will the burn rate be same as before? Assuming my HR is the same. 

I drink 1 liter of kefir a day because I find it extremely helpful to lose weight. But recently i heard that excessive usage might cause some diseases like podagra. However I was unable to find more information about it. I'll post contents of it here. 1 liter kefir has: +10x10^8 kob probiotic microorganisms 380kcal 970mg calcium I'll skip carb, protein etc. Ingredients: pastorized cow milk, water, kefir culture, probiotic microorganisms 

I'm researching about how to increase BMR efficiently. (Note that BMR, not TDEE) I want to increase mine by 100% in the long term. How can I do that? A way is increasing muscle obvisously. Also we see people whose metabolism is faster than usual. They don't move much but they are always skinny even if they eat a lot! I'm sure there are tons of variables relevant but maybe there is something we could replicate or develop to be similar to them. Any ideas about this? 

Sounds to me like you just have to increase the weight -- I mean, go even for sets of heavy singles with weight belt if you have to for that as well. The issue is not that pullups don't "target tht lats" -- they do, but lats are generally going to be the strongest muscles in that whole chain anyway. Since yours are strong enough already for bodyweight, it makes sense that you won't feel them being worked as much as the weaker muscles in that chain (such as elbow flexors and grip muscles in the arms). (The purpose of heavy singles is to workaround any weaknesses or lack of endurance in those weaker non-lat muscles). If, on the other hand, you're just seeking to do "more" pullups per set, then that will be more of an "endurance" (or technically, "time-under-tension") exercise. And consequently, those weaker muscles are really going to be hit hard going for that -- much more so than the already strong and stable lats. Edit: to be fair, assuming you're not talking about "kipping pullups, then some more time-under-tension handling would be critical here -- essentially to take the time to inhibit swinging and do pullups more strictly (kipping pullups limit time-under-tension to permit more reps). 

I bought an elliptical cycle to lose weight. After losing some weight and getting used to it now it feels as easy as walking. It is basically useless now. But I don't want it to go to waste. So I'm looking for a way to make it useful for my workout. Can I increase its resistance by modifying it somehow? Would wearing a 40lbs rucksack while using it a good idea? PS: This is the cycle I have. It has 11-pound magnetic flywheel, which is why it is so easy I think. 

I do cardio in the morning with empty stomach due to work. I find it very difficult to go on after 30 mins. I'm 100kg m 23. HR: 160. Elliptical cycle level 8/8. Daily intake: 1500. BMR: 1700. Desk job and 30 mins cardio everyday. 

No. You actually should breathe through mouth while swimming. When your left shoulder is on top, move your head to right while breating. 

In a similar question the following is stated however I've read online that 30 minutes is better. Is there any conclusive study or research on the ideal length of a cardio for someone who is losing weight? 

I'm no expert in glenohumeral anatomy, but I've noticed that if I do "triceps-style" bar dips, I have no pain nor impingement in the shoulder joint whatsoever. This is the version of dips where the elbow go as far back as possible, almost as if they're trying to touch one another, as opposed to "chest-style" bar dips, where the elbows are much more flared out to the sides. But, taking a look at the skeletal structures of the shoulder joint, I see no reason why moving the humerus "backwards", as opposed to just flaring it out to the sides, should somehow make the movement a lot more impingement-less (mainly across the AC joint, which seems to be the most likely source of impingement). Granted, a simple "skeletal/ligament" view may omitting some other important detail as well --- if my elbow is pointed backwards (with scapulae retracted), I can move the elbow upwards only so far (I cannot raise my elbow above my shoulder joint when it's pointed behind me, for example). So, are there actually other structures in place (e.g., muscle tissue) that could be keeping 'triceps' dips from hurting the shoulder joint? My best guess so far is just deltoids, traps, and the long triceps head simply all bumping into each other thereby blocking any pain-causing or impingement-causing ranges of motion. Edit: According to the image below, what exactly prevents sagittal shoulder extension a full 360Â°? Is it the stretching of the deltoids, or some occlusion between the rear muscle groups bumping into one another, or something else? Since whatever it is, it allows me to do triceps dips comfortably with no pain or impingement whatsoever.
