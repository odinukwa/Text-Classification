i have a wheel, and i want a spare spoke to take touring. (it's a front wheel with a disc rotor, i have one for the rotor side but have lost the one i had for the non rotor side) is it possible accurately measure the spoke when it's in the wheel? i've attempted to use some strings but i'm not clear on where you'd measure to. i understand that you start at the centre of the j bend, but presumably some of the nipple/spoke is inside the rim. perhaps i should remove the tyre and rim tape, and measure the amount of spoke protruding l. is there a reliable technique i can use for this? edit: i'd like to avoid removing a spoke out if at all possible. the rim was built by a professional wheel builder, it's running true and i have only minimal wheel trying skills 

The rubber ring would most likely be a protective seal of some kind, although for which part I am not so sure. I changed my headset earlier last year and don't remember such a part, although my memory isn't great. Can you not determine the possible location based on the rubber ring's size? Most forks are tapered and are larger at the bottom, so the size might make it self-explanatory. My educated guess is that it will be an additional seal which sits between the cartridge bearing/compression ring (the brass coloured ring on the far right) and the dust cover. I terms of installation, the second to right part (the crown race) should be fitted first onto your fork first. Ensure that the surface is clean and no corrosion or other dirt is on your fork from the old race as it won't sit properly. It's unlikely that this rubber ring would go underneath the crown race or above as it would prevent the bearings fitting correctly (the space is usually extremely tight to start with). Although the following image doesn't show the rubber ring, it gives a good indication to the installation order of the rest of the parts. I suggest that the rubber ring goes between the 'dust cover' and 'compression ring' on that photo. An exploded photograph of a bicycle headset, showing the parts in installation order 

I have purchased a handbuilt rear wheel that will be used with a disc brake and never with a rim brake (it has a 6 bolt hub). The rim is a mavic a719. The rim is anodized black but the machined part (rim brake surfact) is silver. Ideally I'd like it to be black for aesthetic purposes and was thinking about giving it a light coat of spray paint. Is there any reason that this is a bad idea? Is there any other way of easily making it black? NB: I'm aware that there are non machined rims available. I'm aware that some my see it as ugly or poor etiquette to run a disc hub and machined rim. After a lot of research, I concluded that this was the rim I wanted. 

Given that it is an old bicycle, it is likely that the chain or the cassette (or even chain ring) are worn down to the point that it's causing your symptoms. However, it's also possible that the derailleurs are mal-configured and your gears need to be indexed correctly. It may be worth checking this out too as it's a relatively quick fix. As pointed out by OraNob, chains generally wear much quicker than cassettes and as a rule of thumb would be replaced more frequently. Chains stretch with use and if left too long can begin causing issues with your cassettes and front chain ring(s). As the teeth don't mesh with the chain properly, the result is a rapid wear of the teeth and will ultimately end up in both needing replacement. Switching cassettes is not really much harder than changing your chain, you just need the right tools for the job. You can pick up relatively cheap cassettes from your local bike shop or online, so cost shouldn't really be an issue here. You need a chain whip to keep the cassette / cogs still, and another tool for unscrewing the cassette. These will depend on your make/model of cassette as there are differing standards.

it's worth noting that although the first bottom bracket came with the bike, i did replace the crankset a few hundred miles before before it started to show play so feasibly i could have done something wrong then; i could have possibly overtightened the plastic pre-load screw on the crank. the second BB didn't have an ideal installation as i did it at the side of the road on tour and there was a tiny tiny amount of drizzle, but i don't think i overtightened the pre load and if any water got into the shell it was only a minute amount. as it's a touring bike it has also had a fair amount of use in the rain and with heavy rear panniers and the occasional rough road. 

Silly question, but have you tried indexing your gears? I had hell with my 105 groupset (Cannondale too) when I first got it a couple of years ago. The problem I find with gears is that if you start messing with all of the different settings, it can throw the whole system of entirely. It took me forever, partly because I was a novice at the time, to get them shifting properly again. Double check all of your alignments and positioning of your d√©railleurs and then perform and indexing on your gears. Put the chain on the inner chain-ring and on the largest cassette, ensuring that your gear lever cannot go down in gears any further. Now click your rear gear lever once, and once only. If it doesn't change gear to the next one on the cassette, use the barrel adjuster located on the rear-derailleur until the gear correctly shifts to the next gear and doesn't make any rough, catching noises. This should automatically progress through the whole range of gears without any further adjustment. If you're convinced that the rest of it is set up correctly, I would be inclined to make sure that your rear axle isn't bent. I have an old wheel where the rear axle was made from a soft metal and subsequently bent whilst riding. This had a knock-on effect of causing my rear cassette to wobble with every wheel revolution and sometimes throw the chain's position off when shifting. 

I have a road-version hollowtech II bottom bracket (shimano 105 model - BB-R60). over the last couple of days i noticed a very slight clicking feeling as i pedalled. removing the crankset i find that the left-hand side of the BB cup feels smooth and snug with no play. however the right sided cup has a very small amount of lateral play. i last replaced the bottom bracket less than six months ago (at which point the old one had developed a significant amount of play after around 1000miles) and i would estimate that the new one has only done around 400miles since. These bottom brackets are non-serviceable, sealed units. Googling suggests that it's not uncommon to get through these pretty quickly, although this does seem odd to me as i thought that outboard bearings were supposed to be more durable and I have hardly ever had to service, never mind replace, the older BBs on my older bikes. i'm about to leave in tour again (around 3000 miles) and I'm wondering how to interpret this small amount of lateral play 

EDIT: I misunderstood your situation hence my original answer. In the case that your shoe is still stuck to the cleat, remove the pedal from the bike first. Keeping the pedal on the bike will just restrict your motion as the crank arm and frame will get the in way. Put the pedal in a vice grip or between two solid objects which allow you to keep the pedal still. Then simply twist the shoe in the normal unlocking direction until it disengages from the pedal. Having the pedal off the bike will allow you to turn the shoe a whole lot further and allow you to unclip. I don't suspect you would cause any damage this way. Removal if it's just the cleat stuck (not on shoe) Firstly make sure that the spring tension on the pedal is all the way down. This is lowered by turning the little hex / Allen screw to the left as much as it will go. Releasing this tension on the spring will make the job a whole lot easier. Then use a set of needle-nose pliers to twist the cleat, simulating the twisting of your foot as you would when it's attached to a shoe. If this doesn't work, you can try and use screwdrivers to pry the tensioned 'catch' away from the cleat, hopefully releasing enough pressure to twist it and remove it. In terms of damaged caused, you may scratch the cleat and/or pedal, but I guess no more than you would by clipping in and out and walking around.
