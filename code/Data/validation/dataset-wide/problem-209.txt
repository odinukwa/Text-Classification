First, consider the psychology of the dictator - that personality trusts no one, has to be first in everything, is extremely egotistical, paranoid and intolerant - especially of disloyalty. So impressing him would mean you're a totally loyal sycophant, but you'd have to be a useful one. Would a dictator encourage cooperation? Not really, that personality is too paranoid. Autocratic tyrant is a synonym for dictator so same applies. A democratically elected leader, however would be another story. Since a hierarchical culture style is set from the top down, the leader would himself have to demonstrate the merits of cooperation, and then develop a reward system for those minions following his example. 

Consider a smallish cube, self powered and capable of projecting interactive holograms. If your far-future race communicates verbally, the cube would be equipped with a language-learning routine, so it would learn the language of the future rather than the inverse. Holographic projection would first allow picto-graph type communication until the cube learned the language and then it could begin to communicate verbally. Preserve it inside one of those molybdenum aluminum boride mononiths (thanks to Pommerbot for the science!) and make it a "quest" to get inside the monolith with all the associated rewards of solving the quest. 

I'm considering the following scenario: Over the course of a couple of weeks, a global plague wipes out 99.999% of humanity, leaving just 75,000 people alive. These people are spread out evenly; in every regional and social group, only one in 100,000 survive. That means 14,000 people survive in China, 80 in New York City, and so on. For these people to recreate the world, they would probably want to stick together. A society of 75,000 people is sustainable, since it includes plenty of doctors, engineers, and every other important skill. But if humanity is split up into tiny groups, scattered across the globe, long-term survival is questionable. The question is, how would these people find each other? Global communication media such as the Internet and cellphone networks will shut down, and most survivors won't even be thinking about finding others until the plague is over. There will be a few surviving pilots, but they won't be enough to transport whole populations, let alone decide on where to go. Practically speaking, how will the survivors manage to join together? 

When dealing with a collective consciousness of any type the best weapon is logic. Think of those ancient Star Trek episodes where Spock presents a paradoxical conundrum to a computer about its behavior and it bricks (after a lot of rattling and smoking). You could do the same to the ants, we're assuming they can communicate and that they're either following the edicts of their queen or some sort of ruling council or quorum. So what argument can you present to the collective consciousness that would show that it needs to stop attacking the terraformers because they are providing something that would help the ant-hill thrive - even while they have some sort of imperative to attack the terraformers. "Must attack humans, but humans give us "x" with the terraforming, must have "X", but must attack humans...." Eventually the ant-hills break down and become just a bunch of regular ants which are good for the terraforming process. 

Suppose a group of people get transported back in time (say 2500 years). Then, in a manner reminiscent of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, they try to re-design modern technology. Assume that there's no shortage of labor or materials; the only real lack is knowledge. What kind of group would have enough knowledge to recreate modern technology within 50 years? Would one average college-educated person be enough, or would it take hundreds of experts? Would there be any particular points that they would get stuck at? For argument's sake, we can define modern technology as: laptop computers, kidney transplants, DNA sequencing, artificial satellites, and nuclear power plants. 

Someone invents a machine that creates electrons. It takes in some electrically neutral matter, and produces electrons of equal mass.1 Let's consider two quantities of negative charge: $q$ is the amount of negative charge that a typical individual might reasonably want to create and use, not counting in lab experiments. $Q$ is the amount of negative charge that if added to the Earth, would soon destroy human society as we know it. (It wouldn't necessarily kill everyone, but it would trigger a huge leap backwards.) I'd like to keep $Q\over q$ within a few orders of magnitude of $10^{10}$. This way I can keep $q$ in the budget range of an upper-class individual, while making $Q$ too expensive to create outside a major government attempt. What are reasonable values for $q$ and $Q$? 1 Of course this violates the principle of conservation of charge. Some skeptics claim that the machine actually sucks the electrons from another part of the universe, but it doesn't really matter. 

What is the purpose / significance of the symbols in the eye? Identification, differentiation? Where would they get the idea in the first place? Maybe someone born with a genetic mutation? 1. maybe that mutation indicates they're from the ruling family - in this case the poser (person with fake lenses) has the potential of gain. 

On intake, implant inmates with a tracking chip which is multifunctional. The chip also "receives" a paralysis field that is broadcast across the prison and its grounds at 2200hrs. This field can also be attributed to the zero jailbreak record of the prison, because it can be turned on manually as well as being set for automatic-on state at 2200hrs. Something to think about is - if this practice becomes widely known will it have an adverse effect on the political ambitions of Ytra? 

Depending upon how fantasy-oriented you want to get in your mystery, the tunnel could be used by an amphibian race that wants to worship but has been generally persecuted - they could arrive/depart via the tunnel. 

Assuming no wars or serious plagues, anywhere from 0 to 18 quadrillion – or more. If each couple has an average of four children, at about the age of twenty, then after 900 years the population will be 17,592,000,000,000,000. If each couple has an average of one child, at the age of twenty, humanity will end in about 250 years. The problem with the 18 quadrillion estimate is the lack of land and resources. live science theorizes that the Earth can support a population of up to 10 billion, long-term. If people will completely ignore sustainability, I'd guess that the limit is about 100 billion. However, if technology improves significantly, or many other planets are colonized, than 18 quadrillion is plausible. In fact, you could go even higher – a nontillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) people is doable with just six children per family. 

Time. For the (assuming self-aware, three-laws compliant robots) robots, time takes the form of energy supply - if they run out of energy, they run out of time. For the humans, time takes the form of robots performing services for them, even earning money for them. Leaving them free to do whatever they want. The exchange rate (between robot time/human time) would be something to work out though. 

In one possible scenario you'll need three elements. 1) A launcher of some type on a orbital platform 2) the Clarke elevator/skyhook to get to the orbital platform and 3) a wormhole network Take the Clarke elevator to the orbital platform, board a launch pod, launch pod is loaded into a launcher and sent through a wormhole to its destination. Of course if the launcher can get the pod up to FTL speed, you might not need the wormholes.
