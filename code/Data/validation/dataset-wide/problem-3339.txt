Nobody knows which happened first, or when, or by which group. But the changes appear in all Germanic languages, so they must have been complete after Proto-Germanic separated from I-E, but before it split up. These changes happened only in mode, never in position -- i.e, dentals changed to dentals, labials changed to labials, etc. The one exception is the PIE labiovelar phonemes -- *ghʷ, *gʷ, *kʷ. Labiovelars were lost in Greek, and smeared all over the spectrum, from labial to velar. Germanic and Latin, however, kept some but not all labiovelars (that's what the Romans used QU for -- /kʷ/ was a separate phoneme from /k/ in classical Latin; and that's also where all the English wh-words came from). 

So many English speakers are uncomfortable with relative clauses with 1st or 2nd person subjects. Most 1st- and 2nd-person verbs are am and are, and these are normally contracted to I'm and you're. So "who am" sounds very very strange to most English speakers. One way out -- there are quite a few -- is to insert a noun phrase like a person instead of who. Since a person is third person, one can say is instead of fussing with other inflected forms. 

Leaving aside X' theory¹, an easy thing to do, since it makes far too many invalid assumptions and doesn't work very well to start with, the question of whether English modals are tensed or not depends on what one means by "tense". Traditionally, tense is a verbal inflectional category, like the Latin, Greek, or Sanskrit tenses. English has only two such, past and present, aside from defective verbs like beware and born. English modal auxiliary verbs, as noted, are not inflected for tense or anything else, except for the special cases that Greg Lee mentioned in his answer, where the old preterite/present modal stems can still occur in that sense. But these are very rare and don't count as inflection, really, since it's simply an opposition. Many theories, however, require a tense marker on every verb (one of the invalid assumptions mentioned above), and so they put one there. Of course the marker is invisible (as well as inaudible), just a local variable that's needed to process the input and eventually disappears. Why go to all the trouble? 

Yes. Some languages have whole systems of them. I've been told by a field worker in Guatemala that Ixil has a whole gestural paradigm of numeral classifiers -- hand gestures that indicate whether you're counting animals, people, things of different kinds, undifferentiated "stuff", etc -- gestures that accompany the numeric counters, in speech, as they're used. On the other hand, some languages don't even have numbers. English does have at least one word, pronounced /ye/, usually spelled "yea" or "yay" when it has to be spelled, that functions only as a gestural quantifier, as in 

It's also an example of Extraposition from NP, since the pied-piped relative clause without which you can't finish the report has been moved from a position following book, which it modifies, to one following the VP did you return, at the end of the sentence. 

As @YellowSky has pointed out, most infinitive clauses are governed by the matrix predicate. There are a number of auxiliaries that must be followed in construction by an infinitive verb form. All the modal auxiliary verbs (including the NPI semimodals need and dare, as well as the periphrastic modals like hafta, wanna, oughta, able to, and need to) must be followed immediately by an infinitive verb form, and the same is true of do in its Do-Support andEmphatic senses. but not *Do you liking/liked ice cream? I did take it out! but not *I did taking/took it out. 

To answer the last question first, Infinitive is a term from Latin grammar. It refers in Latin to one of several tenseless verb forms. Etymologically, infinitive means 'unending' (just like infinite); here the reference is to lack of tense. In other languages, infinitive is often used to describe one, or more, untensed verb forms. The Latin terms Participle, Gerund, and Gerundive are also in use for untensed verb forms. What these terms mean, in each language, has to be determined individually. There is no consistency. The rest of the question is about English infinitives, and here the trick is knowing that there are two different meanings for infinitive in English grammar. If you keep them straight, you won't be easily confused. 

In English, certainly the most common use of do is Do-Support. DS is invoked whenever a construction requiring an auxiliary verb (like Question or Negative): 

(pronounced "N-Bar" -- don't ask), which is a phrasal unit headed by an and (pronounced "N-P"), which is the syntactic constituent type corresponding to the logical type Argument of Predicate (and thus is outside the X-Bar nodal system). 

One good example is what happened to PIE labiovelars in Greek. At some point, Greek lost its labiovelar consonants as such. Classical Greek has three consonant series 

Ambitransitive is likely to have a meaning only in certain theories that make certain assumptions, like the assumption that transitivity is a property of verbs (instead of constructions), for instance. In fact transitivity is a very complex property, in that the details of the verb - direct object relation are very dependent on the semantics of the verb (or adjective or noun -- not all transitive constructions have verbal predicates). Normally we would consider walk prototypically intransitive, and eat prototypically transitive. But consider: 

Semantically, unless is usually parsed as , introducing a negated conditional clause; i.e, unless he forgets means if he doesn't forget. Logically, it's the of a proposition . Lexically, less is the diminutive (negative) comparative, contrasting with the augmentative more. (Note that the diminutive less has no alternative suffix like more/-er ; it's completely periphrastic) Morphologically, -less is an idiomatic privative (and therefore negative) suffix denoting absence: 

Adverbs have long been called a ‘wastebasket’ category in syntax. Their definition is very general: adverbs are distinguished from adjectives, which modify nouns, by saying that ‘adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs’; to this one can add that they may also modify phrases and clauses as a whole. If something doesn’t fit nicely in some other word class, it generally gets lumped in as an adverb of some sort. Traditionally, adverbs (and adverbials, which means ‘any chunk that acts like an adverb’ -– not a terribly precise definition) represent qualifications and afterthoughts to ordinary propositions. And they can occur in many different positions in the sentence, which means they may or may not be close to whatever constituents they focus on. Which allows lots of useful variations and conventions. "Sentence adverb" is not a type of adverb. It's a type of adverbial construction, or usage; one of the things some adverbs can do. That's all. And "sentence adverb" is a sloppy technical term, since it doesn't distinguish "sentence adverbs" from "clause adverbs", or "phrase adverbs", which also exist, but are not mentioned. So I wouldn't worry too much about "sentence adverbs". 

Absolutely it does. Aside from various bitransitive schemes, two NPs in a row is a standard parsing signal for an upcoming relative clause with a nonsubject relative. 

This English phoneme is entirely vocalic phonetically, but it's a consonant phonologically. In fact, it's the English phoneme /h/, which used to be pronounced as a velar fricative; but since it only appears before vowels in Modern English, it has become a mere voiceless vocal onset, setting the tongue in position for the oncoming vowel, and then starting the phonation before starting the voicing. Names are just names, even for phonemes; but the usual convention (not followed with /h/) is to use the name of the most common allophone for the phoneme when possible. 

Otavio is right. These are demonstrative pronouns. More importantly, this and that are Deictic Expressions, having meaning only in the contexts of the actual speech act. They're only a small fraction of the deictic paradigms that English used to have. For details on deictic expressions, see Fillmore's classic "May We Come In?" and his description of deixis in the Deixis Lectures. 

The construction has fallen out of habit -- Harper Collins marks it "(archaic)" -- and it appears now only in old writing, or in new writing that's trying to sound old. The reason why the in the which fell out of favor is probably because the there adds nothing to the sentence but a certain fustian elegance. Non-restrictive relative clauses are already presupposed, hence definite; nothing is served by adding a definite article. As noted in the question, Latin qui, quae, quod, quis, quid, and all their descendants still spelled with qu in Romance languages are historically cognate with what, why, which, etc. via Grimm's Law. Where Romance languages have qu-words in their grammars, English has wh-words. More interestingly, also via Grimm's Law, where Latin had demonstrative t-words like tantum and talis matching interrogative qu-words like like quantum and qualis, English has demonstrative th-words like that, then, there, thither, thence matching interrogative what, when, where, whither, whence. Just as PIE labiovelar *kʷ became labiovelar stop qu- (originally pronounced [kʷ]) in Latin (and most other IE languages) and labiovelar fricative wh- originally pronounced [xʷ]) in English (and other Germanic languages), PIE dental *t became dental stop t- in Latin and dental fricative th- in English. Those are two of the 12 systematic consonant changes that make up Grimm's Law. 

I don't know the details, but here's what he said in an interview in Glot, a newsletter for linguists. 

That is, there are Active sentences with no corresponding Passives, but there are no Passives with no corresponding Actives. This is a fact, and if grammar is about facts, it ought to be able to state this fact. One way to do this is to consider Passive a special effect that can be applied to most transitive sentences, but not to intransitive sentences. Another point to make is that corresponding Active/Passive sentences mean the same thing. 

With all the negativity around, it's not surprising that a prepositional prefix gets interpreted as a negative prefix. Negation always has a focus and therefore has a field, like a magnetic pole. Anything in an utterance falling inside that negative field (called a negative's 'scope' in the trade) can pick up secondary negation, or "negation by association". Like pas in French ne ... pas, which is now a negative all by itself, although it originally meant 'step'. 

are invented by people who need abbreviations for commonly-referenced groups of characteristics, usually characteristics that are common only in monolingual places like the USA, where almost everybody speaks only English, and often finds multilingualism threatening. They are not terms defined in the Qur'an or the APA Style Manual; they are just abbreviations, which may be useful in certain contexts among certain kinds of professional. That's all, really. These terms, and others, may or may not be applicable to the situations you mention. Or to others one can easily imagine. I repeat, they're just nonce forms, with localized definition and localized utility. They are Not Ready For Prime Time, in other words, so you shouldn't take them too seriously. And they certainly don't cover every possibility. 

as well as many other linguistic phenomena, which suggests that duality of one kind or another is semantically unusual, and has some of the irregular and arbitrary characteristics of the numeral one (which is often extended for use as a demonstrative, a pronoun, or an article, and which has unique syntax in every language); as well as some of the regular characteristics of compositional numbers like seventy-three. Dual is transitional between singular and plural, and it's semantically significant because we are bilaterally symmetric animals and therefore have plenty of reason to refer to things that come in pairs. Plus there are two sexes which mate in pairs, and that's an area rife with irregularity and arbitrariness. This extends to decades (for 10-based systems; I'll use the term for all recurring sequences, of whatever base) as well as numbers. In any system, the first decade is usually composed of unique base units (though not always; in Ute, for instance, nine means 'almost ten'). The second decade is full of irregularities, but not usually new bases. The third and following decades are usually very regular. 

Almost means 'close to, but lower than, some clinal value'. Half sane and half crazy both refer to the midpoint on the cline, i.e, they do point to the same position on the cline. But they refer to opposite directions on the cline. Half sane means 'a sanity value of .5'; i.e, sane is UP, crazy is DOWN on the cline. Half crazy means 'a craziness value of .5'; i.e, crazy is UP, sane is DOWN. Since almost is always on the DOWN side of a cline position, almost half crazy does not mean the same as almost half sane. Almost half crazy announces a craziness value < .5, and thus a sanity value > .5. This is saner than almost half sane, which announces a sanity value < .5. Good luck doing this with syntax trees. 

Trees are not going to solve the problem. This is not a syntactic issue; it's semantic. Note, no syntax up my sleeve in the following. ... represents a semantic cline, with sane and crazy at opposite poles. 

These, by the way, have two different implications, depending on whether is he? (or isn't he?) has Y/N Q (rising) intonation, which is a real question, or ordinary full stop intonation (like a Wh-Q gets), which is simply a rhetorical question, stating the speaker's belief, and requires no response, though it often invites one. 

then is the subject that did not stand against (and thus disqualify) , and therefore can be ignored from now on. Finally, a word as big and transparent as notwithstanding is likely to become an adverb indicating the importance of a particular piece of evidence, and like most adverbs, its position is subject to the whims of the speaker and can certainly modify a verb phrase. To answer the presenting question, no, there's no consistent difference between the phrases 

Everybody learns languages differently, depending on how they learned their own languages, how close the language they're learning is to them, what their motivations are, how hard they work, whether they're literate, whether they're intelligent, and a whole lot of other things. Therefore, there can be no method of teaching that will work best. Some ways will work with some students when used by some teachers. Other combinations won't. You have to try a lot and see what works with which students. As a consequence, you should realize that no theory about foreign language teaching methodology is authoritative; most textbooks believe they are better and say so, but there's no evidence.
