'Impossible' means either that you could not sanely get an aircraft off the "ground" or that, if you'd done so, it would probably be the last bad decision you ever made. For freight, going by "road" is much more reliable and economical than by air, even though the average road speed is under 50 miles per day. 'Rather specialised ' convoys make the trip regularly. For some reason they call it the South Pole Traverse. It's about 1000 miles each way - although another 1000 may end up happening. A round trip takes typically 40 or 50 days. Pictures from here - 'South Pole Traverse'. 

I'm going to take a shot at near-term technology forecasting, and say that your time traveller's near future smartphone and laptop are probably charged over some version of USB (unless they're Apple devices, in which case they'll probably use some more-or-less equivalent proprietary system). The common everyday USB port hides quite a bit of complexity, with the same wires carrying both power and data, and with a complex hardware/software protocol for negotiating communication and power delivery parameters. This makes "hotwiring" a primitive power source into a USB connector pretty difficult, and likely to risk damaging the electronics if you do it wrong. Fortunately, however, our intrepid time traveller probably won't have to do that, not unless they also forgot to bring a charger for their devices. There are several types of such chargers, each of them good for different situations: 

I long ago designed exercise bike controllers. Figures below are from memory and 'less than exact' but should give ballpark ideas. Use a (conceptual) bike! Rather than trying to harness blood flow and heart-pump which are not optimised for energy output, use a portion of the body which is - ie leg muscles with suitable electrical control signals for leg activation driving an alternator or equivalent. The "user" could be in any suitable position - on their back with legs bent to drive pedal mechanism would work well enough (bicycle position rotated backwards about 120 degrees. Or a "recumbent" posture. Many ideas here. Various ideas of how maximal energy can be extracted over longer periods. Note attitude of rear rider in tandem configuration. 

I suspect you may be overthinking this. Why not just transmit a simple geometric progression like, say: 

As Mike Scott notes, we don't know yet. Our current exoplanet survey techniques are so strongly biased in favor of planets that are close to their sun (and therefore likely to be tidally locked) that they don't yet allow reliably estimating the fraction of all planets that orbit further out (and therefore probably aren't locked). That said, you hypothetical aliens probably don't care about the total ratio of tidally locked to non-locked planets, anyway. What they care about is the fraction of life-bearing planets that are tidally locked to their star. That's, of course, even harder to estimate using current data (since we haven't even detected any life-bearing planets other than Earth yet), but we do have the following suggestive observations: 

Not at Mcmurdo per se but at a remote field base which they flew to from Mcmurdo, on one occasion they crashed three C-130 Hercules aircraft (small-airliner size freight carriers) aircraft in a row before giving up and leaving them until a later date to attempt recovery. XD-07 aka Betty Boop was recovered 5 years later. Interesting account of the events here From either town to "civilisation" (which is Christchurch in New Zealand) is about 2000 miles - the normal means of access is by air as the alternative sea + "land" route is an adventure in its own right. 

If the ships really are travelling at the speed of light, using known physics (which is possible, sort of — see below), then they cannot communicate. The reason for this is time dilation: the closer to the speed of light the ship moves, the slower its proper time passes. At the limit of a ship moving at the speed of light, no proper time passes for it — from the perspective of the passengers, they arrive at their destination immediately after embarking on their journey. Thus, there will be no time for the passengers to send or receive any messages, or to do anything else, during the journey. So, how can we make a ship travel at the speed of light using known physics? Well, according to the theory of relativity, only massless particles like photons can reach the speed of light, so we'll have to make the ship (and anything it carries) out of light (or some other massless particles, but light really is the most convenient). In practice, such a "ship" would be more like a Star Trek transporter than anything one would normally describe as a spaceship: at the departure station, using Sufficiently Advanced Science™, the passengers will be converted into a pulse of light, which is beamed at a distant receiver that reverses the process. As far as the passengers are concerned, the process resembles instantaneous teleportation, although, of course, a year of (coordinate) time will actually have passed for every light year so travelled. Of course, this process would be a lot more convenient if the "passengers" were already encoded into easily transmissible information — that is, if they were either AIs, or humans (or other originally biological creatures) somehow "uploaded" into software. In fact, if you want to transmit beings with physical bodies this way, the easiest way would be to first scan into a software emulation, transmit the software, and then, if desired, rebuild new bodies for them at the destination. (Hey, I didn't say it would be easy — just easier than the alternatives.) Or, of course, you can postulate some new physics (or exotic edge cases of current physics theories, such as stable wormholes) that allow faster-than-light travel. In that case, however, you're pretty much free to assume anything you want about how in-flight communications would work (or not work, as it might be). For the specific case of wormhole travel, a reasonably plausible assumption would be that ships travelling through the same wormhole could communicate just like in normal space (after all, a wormhole is normal space, just with a weird geometry), but any signals sent from inside one wormhole to another would have to take a detour through the wormhole mouth(s).

The first few numbers are small enough that the pattern should be easy to spot, but they increase rapidly. There's a simple one-to-one relation between successive pairs of numbers — the next one is 3 times the previous one — and the numbers in this sequence are also recognizable on their own, being the only numbers not divisible by any prime other than 3. The base of the progression can indeed be chosen more or less arbitrarily, but I would suggest that it should preferably be: 

Available energy: Start with an energy input of about 2000 kilo calories per day for a semi sedentary person. 1 cal ~= 4.2 watt-second = 4.2 Joule. 2000 kCal = 2000 x 1000 x 4.2 J ~= 8.4 MJ/day. 1 kWh = 1000 W x 3600 seconds = 3.6 MJ. So TOTAL food energy for average person ~~~= 2.333 kWh . At (unobtainable) 100% efficiency that's about $0.60 of electricity at 25c/unit. If you can extract 10% of total energy from user that's ~=1/4 kWh or 6c of electricity equivalent./day. More food = more energy and probably a greater % out but still small. Sanity check: I could pedal an exercycle for say 15 hours/day at 50 Watts if my life depended on it. 50 Watts is a very easy pedalling rate against a light but noticeable load. After an hour os so I'd find it annoying (some wouldn't). After 15 hours I'd be exhausted but it should be maintainable given enough food and fitness. That's 50W x 15 hours x 3600 sec/hour = 2.7 MJ. My food requirement would rise - I'd expect to 3000-4000 kCal/day or say 12-16 Mj/day range. I could maybe do 100 Watts for an hour and be "rather tired". Once I could do 500 Watts for about 10 seconds and then needed a good lie down :-). To fly the English Channel under your own power takes 300-500 Watts for as long as it takes. That makes the mechanical output about say 15-20% efficient. Not bad. On the level on a bicycle I'd expect 50 Watts continuous to give me say 4 to 5 kilometres per hour so that would take me about 60 to 75 km in a day :-) Any hills would greatly reduce that. Leg muscles, heart etc could probably be run semi indefinitely (given enough food input and suitable plumbing) at say 100 Watts, so about triple my 100 Watts x 15 hours results. Energy sources: Despite what people say here, I've long been impressed at how much work you can get from a human body on a kg or so of semi random carbohydrates. If you used solar heated ponds to grow "** Cyano-bacteria aka blue- green algae aka 'pond scum"** you may [tm] be able to run the energy production system on the output. Each person-unit is only running at 100 Watts say but 24 hours / day so that's equivalent to eg a solar panel's 4hrs mean sun/day year round in most areas. So a 100W person gives the same daily energy as a 600 Watt PV panel which has an area of about 4 square meters at current module delivered efficiencies of say 15%. A panel does not need algal fuel - but a person unit can probably fit in one square meter and can be stacked N high, unlike panels which must "see" the sun directly. Persons have to be plumbed (algal matter and water in, waste products out). The algal ponds take extra area - probably in excess of the PV panel area needs. Overall it may depend on available resources - but PV panels sound like an easier task :-). 

From the viewpoint of evolutionary dynamics, the reason why very few species are both autotrophic (photosynthesizing) and heterotrophic (hunting / foraging on other living organism) at the same times is that these two lifestyles tend to require quite different adaptations. One notable example is motility. Efficient foraging organisms typically need to move, but movement consumes a lot of energy, which require a relatively high-intensity energy source, like consuming other organisms. Meanwhile, a photosynthetic organism rarely needs to move, but, with the low energy density available from photosynthesis, it also cannot afford to move much. Thus, in general, animals and other foragers tend to be actively mobile, while plants and other photosynthesizers tend to be sessile (or free-floating). As a result, there are few fitness maxima between these two lifestyles. A creature with such a hybrid lifestyle can usually increase it fitness via mutations that improve its foraging efficiency at the expense of photosynthesis, or vice versa, and so evolution tends to drive such species (if they survive) towards one end of the spectrum or the other — either losing its photosynthetic ability to become a pure heterotroph, or becoming fully dependent on it, and thus a pure autotroph. 

Give the British Monarchy model a try. You'll like it :-) I live on the leading edge of the empire (first to see the sun) - and disagree with Martin. While the Queen may in theory have little political power, the difference between theory and practice is greater in practice than in theory. The Queen's [tm] power lies in presumed steel fist in many many layers of velvet glove, to the extent that while everyone "knows" that the steel fist is not actually there, in practice it is (even though it's not, even ...) The end result is that the Queen can very easily "lean" on people / organisations / traditions ... and has to (and does) take great care to not to be seen to do any leaning. Reading Winston Churchill's "The Second World War" and other of his writings makes it clear that the then King had substantial influence on Churchill's actions - especially his considered more extreme ones. These mainly related to Churchill's health and safety and likelihood of being alive next week on various occasions, but were not limited to this area.
