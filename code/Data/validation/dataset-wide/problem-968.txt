The study's estimated range of plastic entering the ocean is 4.8 million to 12.7 million metric tons (MMT). For the United States we can find some other figures to try to complete the picture. According to the EPA, in 2012, the US generated 251 MMT of municipal solid waste (MSW). Of that, 11.7% was burned, 34.5% was recovered by some sort of recycling, and 53.8% was discarded (Fig. 4). Plastics compose 12.7% of pre-recycling waste but 17.6% of post-recycling waste. Biodegradables (here I'm using food, paper, yard trimmings, and wood, but not textiles) consist of 61.7% of trash before recycling and 52.8% after. So if we assume those ratios can be applied to the plastics sent to the ocean (8 MMT) you get the following: 

Gordon Stanger covers the climate aspects well in his answer, but I thought I'd chime in with an answer to the "was it as much a desert as it is now?" While I'm not aware of any archaeological evidence for the agriculture in the land surrounding Masada at the time of the siege, there are several factors that may have, at that time, made the area less 'deserty.' There are two in particular I want to mention. The first are qanats. This technology spread from Persia around ~500 BC and quite impressive ones were built by the Romans in dry places, like this one from modern day Jordan. Masada is in a cliff overlooking the Dead Sea, but the top of the fortress is only about 60 meters above sea level; the surrounding land is much lower. This puts it in a good position to receive water from nearby groundwater at higher elevation. As can be seen in Google Maps, The land rises 200m in 2.5 km to the West, and 400m in about 5.5 km. Google Maps even indicate the course of several wadis that flow in the general direction of Masada which could be used as the basis for a partially underground irrigation system. Qanats take a lot of work to build and maintain, but in a land where there is cheap labor and little water, it can be worth it to build them. The Middle East at the time had plenty of desert adapted trees that could thrive with a little irrigation (almonds, olive, carob, date, pistachio; all mentioned in the Bible), so it is entirely possible that there were groves of desert trees in the land around Masada. This brings us to the second point: tree cover. The tree cover currently existing in the area around Masada (i.e. none) doesn't have to be the tree cover that was always there. Trees being rare in the southern Levant, they were always under pressure for use as firewood, and their regrowth was limited by grazing, especially by goats. There are several trees (large shrubs really) that can grow in such hot and dry conditions, as they are present in the rest of the Negev desert in Israel, such as Acacia, Pistachia, and Tamarix. Acacia in particular may be a keystone species, such that higher, ancient levels of tree cover could have encouraged a generally greener landscape. In conclusion, while the area around Masada is barren now, it does not have to have been 2000 years ago. There were labor intensive irrigation techniques and tree crops available to make successful farming a possibility, and lower firewood and grazing pressure from a lower population may have allowed the wilderness areas to have been greener than they are today. 

To answer the question in the title (with another question): better for what? To answer the questions in the body: there is another system called rectilinear or x-y-z Cartesian coordinates. This system is the same as the 3-d Cartesian coordinates you used in calculus class. The center of the Earth is (0,0,0), and generally the z-direction goes to the poles, while x and y go to the equators at right angles, and towards points specified by whatever datum you are using. For example, the North Pole could be coordinates (0,0,6353000) in meters. As for tools to do the conversion, you should probably send those kinds of questions to the GIS Stack Exchange. However, since they tend to be snippy when I've asked questions in the past I will tell you how I do it. I use the pyproj package for python, which is a python wrapper around the C Proj4 package. Pyproj is pretty straight forward to use, but the transformations you want might not be so easy to figure out. The information you want is the EPSG numbers of the transforms. If you are using the common WGS-84 datum, for example, the rectilinear is 'epsg:4978' while the lat-lon is 'epsg:4326'. A code example follows from a python (3.5) interactive console. To transform the estimated coordinates of the north pole above, we want to go from rectilinear to lat-lon. 

Carbon credit accreditation is a process done by independent accrediting agencies. It is comparable to the way that universities are accredited by various agencies saying that their degrees are legit. You sign up to do a project to reduce carbon output, and then the accrediting agency confirms that you did just that. Carbon offsetting isn't a future's market, it is a (financial) commitment to a project right now that is dedicated to lowering greenhouse gasses. Here is a list of potential projects, and here is a map showing projects in progress with a certain company. I'm actually really glad you asked this question, because I just assumed that carbon offsets were effective proven means, like planting trees. But looking at some of these projects is bringing up some doubt in my mind. I don't see how burning methane into CO$_2$ is doing anything except turning a larger short-term problem into a smaller long-term problem. Or how to measure the exact number of tons of carbon you are saving by changing domestic behavior. 

However, they provide no evidence as to how or in which direction modern instruments might be biased compared to older ones, nor do they provide any evidence that the time of observation has changed. These claims basically amount to a courtroom-style tactic of casting doubt on the prosecution's story. However, without evidence global temperature estimates are systematically biased, I'm inclined to trust the peer-reviewed work of the scientists who made these estimates in the first place. Without evidence supporting these claims, the author's argument falls apart, in my opinion. The rest of the paper points to the corrections made in older data, showing that corrections made over the last 25 years have steadily increased the magnitude of global temperature rise in the 20th century. These historical data corrections are made for a purpose. If the authors of this paper think the historical data corrections are not being done properly, then they have to attack the methodology behind those corrections. However, the authors of the linked paper do not do this. The underlying data still supports global warming As I mentioned, the thrust of the article is that corrections made to the calculation of global temperature averages from historical data are systematically biasing the data in favor of a linear warming trend. The graph on page 11 of the paper provides a key piece of evidence. The blue line shows the original 1980 global historical temperature estimates, while the other lines show progressive refinements of that data through 2015. However, the original line still shows increasing temperatures. Even only though 1980, the original line shows a temperature increase (albeit cyclical) of about 0.4 C over the hundred odd years of the chart. Even if the newer data's 'correction factor' of about +0.15 C (per chart IV-2) is taken out, the temperatures then rise another 0.4-0.15 = 0.25 C in the 30 years from 1980 to 2010. In short, the author's argument is that the global warming effect is being created by systematic biasing of an underlying data set; however, the underlying data set itself still shows a positive (if cyclical) warming trend of about 0.65 C over the past 130 years. Therefore, even assuming the author's claims are correct that researchers are inappropriately manipulating data, the evidence still shows global warming over the past century plus. This suggests that if the authors are correct, perhaps the sensitivity of the climate models should be lowered; I don't see how it upends modern global warming theory or 'totally dismantles' anything. Conclusion I like to consider myself a skeptic, more or less. However, skepticism requires evidence, and there just isn't any evidence in this paper. Furthermore, even if the papers unsupported assertions turn out to be true, they don't provide an argument, much less any evidence, that carbon dioxide driven global warming is not happening. They don't provide any alternative theories to explain the magnitude of the warming that visible in the data, assuming that they are true in their claims of improper correction. Therefore, I would have to answer the question 'Could this study "totally dismantle" Global Warming claims?' with a categorical no.
