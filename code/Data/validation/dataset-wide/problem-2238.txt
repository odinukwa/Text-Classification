Referencing the rules for the 2014 Tour De France (I am assuming that these follow general standards for international cycling, but had a hard time finding a specific source for global cycling competition rules, like FIFA has rules for soccer around the world - if anyone finds a set of rules, I'd be interested in seeing them). Article 24 of the rules has the following to say in regards to ranking: 

And, of course, pocketing the Cue Ball is a foul, under Rule 6.1, Cue Ball Scratch or off the Table: 

Short answer: Yes. Getting the ball first has no relation (in the rules) to whether it's a foul or not. In the Law of the Game there is actually no mention about getting to the ball first when in reference to a foul. Law 12, regarding Fouls and Misconduct, can be found starting on Page 36 of the document linked below. I won't recap the full text of it (it's about 4 pages long), but the highlights are basically that a foul (in the run of play) consists of any of the following, if the referee considers it to be careless, reckless or using excessive force: 

EDIT: I've known people to ask about the formation that the sportscasters usually announce before the game, so here are some notes on that. I do not have citations for these, they're just what I believe to be true. Although a formation is not required by the rules, it is often possible to tell what a formation will look like by examining the players that will be on the field. Some players are generally attackers, some defenders, and some midfielders. You can also sometimes tell based on knowledge about the coach - what formations has s/he used in the past in different situations. Lastly, I believe that coaches sometimes will mention the formation they're using when announcing the starting line-up. This is not required, though. Best source I have for this is another stackexchange post. 

I believe it would NOT be a let. That is, it would be a legal service and the server would earn the point (assuming the receiver did not return it). I'm referencing the rules at PongWorld.com. In the description of the service (rule 2.06) the rules state (emphasis mine): 

In the current Official Baseball Rules (pdf), there is only one reference to a "fourth out" that I can find. Page 49, part of Rule 5.09(c) - Making an Out, says: 

Assuming that there was no-one else on base, my guess is the umpire would have to call him out. I reference rule 7.8 from the MLB rule book (link at the bottom of the post): Rule 7.8: 

I've left out fouls that are not in relation to the run of play, but you can see the whole list on the document. As you can see, none of the fouls have anything to do with the ball. Many fans will claim that if a player gets the ball they can do no wrong, but that is not part of the rules. With regard to the first example you cited, the reason behind why the foul was not given was not because Neuer got to the ball first. Rather, it was likely because the referee did not think a foul had been committed (in fact, I think he called a foul against Higuain). There is an argument to be made that Neuer's jump towards the ball was reckless, but both players had eyes on the ballso if that was reckless, then Higuain running into the goalkeeper could also be deemed reckless. Goalkeepers do tend to be protected a bit because they are often in vulnerable positions - jumping up high to get to the ball with their hands. For the Fucile-Sanchez foul, that was called a foul because the referee deemed it a reckless challenge. It's hard to see on the replays I've seen, but it looks like Fucile comes in and lifts his trailing leg up, thus catching Sanchez's feet between his two legs. This can be very dangerous for the player's ankles. That's my guess as to why the card was given. The answer to whether these calls were "good" or not will likely be different depending on which team you're rooting for! Being impartial, I think the second call is a very good one. The first I think would be a good no-call (though, as I said, I think a foul was called against Neuer, which I would disagree with). $URL$ 

Yes, since formations aren't mentioned at all in the rules, they can be adjusted. Sometimes when making a substitution, a coach will sub in a defender for an attacker/midfielder if the team is ahead and wants to protect their lead. The opposite can happen too. But it all depends on the situation of the game. Again, it all depends on the layout of the game. I'd say the most likely time when a formation change would happen is probably halftime, so the coach can discuss the new strategy in depth with the players, but it could happen at any point. 

There is a force out at third. Throwing to a closer base is generally safer. Getting an out at third would probably have prevented at least one run from scoring. 

You're partially correct, but I think you're not applying the concept of a normal distribution in quite the right way for the context. In the context of hitting streaks, it would be more appropriate to look at the normal distribution as related to hitting streaks. In other words, assuming that hitting streaks follow a normal distribution with some mean indicating the average length of a hitting streak (say, 10 games). If you assume that hitting streaks are normally distributed, then to see a hitting streak of, say, 30 games won't happen very often, but it will happen. And even hitting streaks of 56 games, like Joe Dimaggio's record, will happen, just very, very rarely. Assuming that hitting streaks follow a normal distribution does not, however, imply that a player's skill necessarily fluctuates. If you view batting average as a measurement of skill, for example, you can draw a parallel between batting average and probability. If a player has a batting average of .300, the parallel is that they have a 30% chance of getting a hit. If an event (at bat) has a 30% chance of success, and the event happens 3-4 times per game, you can calculate the expected "hitting streak" (i.e. minimum 1 success per game). That would be the mean of your distribution. You can also calculate the standard deviation of the streak and that gives you a normal distribution. So we can still view a player as having a fixed skill level (which may or may not be correct) and it doesn't contradict the idea that long hitting streaks are expected to happen given the probability distribution of hitting streaks. I also think that doesn't necessarily take away from the value of a long hitting streak. A player with an "underlying skill" (i.e. Batting Average) of .300 is still much more likely to have a 20+ game hitting streak than a player with an "underlying skill" of .200. 

Rule 5.08 in the MLB Rules has an Approved Ruling at the end (top of page 39) that reads as follows: 

So, this guy probably would have been out under the rules had he picked up the ball, even though no-one else was on and there was no advantage to be gained from it. If the ball is called dead (or time is called - effectively the same) anyone can touch the ball. You'll often see batters pick up a ball that was fouled straight down and drops right in front of the plate, or base coaches pick up balls and toss them to the crowd or ball boy/girl for slow hit balls that have been called foul. No penalty. $URL$ 

In your description, the ball has already completed the "passing over or around the net assembly" and landed on the other side. As such, the serve is legal and what happens next is all part of normal play. There is an exception in rule 2.09 if the player is in a wheelchair - in that case, if the ball returns towards the net after hitting the other side then it IS a let, regardless of whether it touches the net again or not. 

In both cases, the batter-runner is the third out on the play for missing first base. No runs score. 

Serious foul play is a sending-off (i.e. red card) offence. As the wikipedia article says (at least now, Fillet's seems to say it was recently updated), a two-footed tackle is only penalized if it is careless, reckless or made with excessive force - the same language in the first rulebook citation above. So a two-footed tackle itself is not illegal. It's only illegal if it is careless, reckless or made with excessive force. The reason why two-footed tackles are often punished is because they are more likely to be careless/reckless. The big danger is that you catch the other player's feet/ankles between your legs, which can easily lead to a sprain, twisted ankle, or (less easily, but most dangerous) broken ankle. For this reason, many players will tuck back one of their legs when attempting a slide tackle - both for a cleaner tackle and for the safety of the other player. FIFA's Laws of the Game is linked below. One note is that amateur leagues will play by mostly FIFA rules, but with some significant modifications. In some, slide tackles are not allowed at all. In others, two-legged tackles may be illegal. As pointed out in the comments, these are likely not true association football, as these are not standard rule modifications allowed by FIFA (without prior approval). However, many of these leagues are non-competitive anyway. $URL$ 

I throw darts fairly regularly. When you say that your feet were parallel to the oche, did you mean perpendicular? If you stand with your feet parallel, then you'll be facing the board straight on and it will be very hard to do this. Here's my suggestion - place one foot (generally the same foot as your throwing hand, so right foot for a righty, left foot for a lefty) right up against the oche. Put most of your weight on that foot and place the other foot a little bit back (maybe 10-15 inches). Just use the toe of that foot to help maintain balance. At this point, you'll have your body turned a bit - somewhat perpendicular to the oche. Turn your body a bit more so that your throwing shoulder is in front of your body. Bring your dart up in front of your face, and you'll find that it's much easier to keep the dart in line with your eye (as long as you don't move your upper arm too much when throwing). Here's a site with pictures of the foot position and one view of the shoulder/upper arm: $URL$ 

This usually happens when the ball is very close (just a few inches) and the player is almost guaranteed (99+%) to make it. In non-professional play, players will sometimes just pick up the ball without tapping it in, but in professional play the ball must go into the cup, no matter how close it is. As gbianchi says in the comments, the player who is farthest away is usually the next to go (Rule 10-1b), but he's not entirely correct in that someone closer is not allowed to go first. The relevant rules are 22-1 and 22-2. Rule 22-1 and 22-2 allow for any player lifting any ball (lifting means you remove it but replace it in exactly the same spot after the other player shoots) if the ball may assist another player (Rule 22-1) or the shooting player having another ball lifted if it will interfere with his/her own shot (Rule 22-2). They both have the same clause in them: "In stroke play, a player required to lift his ball may play first rather than lift the ball." So for a "tap in" situation, usually the ball is so close to the hole that it may interfere with another player's putt, so the player who has the "tap in" can choose to putt it instead of lifting it. Note that this does not require the permission of the other player - on the putting green a person may lift their ball without someone else asking (this is not true off the green - see Note 1 to Rule 22-2). Now as to the stance, the relevant rule is Rule 16-1e. It says: "e. Standing Astride or on Line of Putt The player must not make a stroke on the putting green from a stance astride, or with either foot touching, the line of putt or an extension of that line behind the ball. Exception: There is no penalty if the stance is inadvertently taken on or astride the line of putt (or an extension of that line behind the ball) or is taken to avoid standing on another player’s line of putt or prospective line of putt." So because a player cannot stand on another player's putting line, they usually have to stand farther away from a "tap in" than they normally would and lean over to it. Source: USGA Rules - $URL$ 

Rule 2.00 in the official rules of Major League Baseball defines "The League President" as: THE LEAGUE PRESIDENT is the league official charged with enforcing these Rules, fining or suspending any player, manager, coach or umpire for violation of these Rules, resolving any disputes involving these Rules or determining any protested games. Rule 2.00 (League President) Comment: With respect to the Major Leagues, the functions of the League President pursuant to these Rules shall be carried out by the designees of the Commissioner of Baseball. The Commissioner may designate different officials to carry out different functions of a League President pursuant to these Rules. So the Commissioner or his designees would handle anything like that. Source: MLB rules - $URL$ NOTE: Just like in other sports, the MLB rules are designed to be used for all kinds of leagues, not just the professional ones. Minor league teams and club leagues usually follow these rules (mostly) and have their own presidents, hence the use of the term throughout the rules even though the American League and National League no longer have their own presidents. 

It seems to me like the third out in your scenario would end the inning immediately and the batter-runner would no longer be required to touch first base. Wikipedia disagrees with me, but there is no citation for the specific scenario. If step 3 doesn't happen, then the run definitely counts. Third outs only negate a run if they are a force or happen before the runner crosses the plate. See rule 5.08a: 

So, in the situation you've described, the shooter fouled since they pocketed the cue ball (Rule 6.1). Therefore the shot was not legal (Rule 8.2), therefore the table is still open since the shooter "[failed] to legally pocket his called ball" (Rule 3.4). 

The interfering player made every effort to avoid interfering. The player on the ball would have had a reasonable shot. The player on the ball would not have had a clear winning shot. 

The rules actually don't say anything about formations. The only thing they say is that there are 11 players per side - one of which is designated a goalkeeper, and that if a team drops below 7 players the match cannot start/continue (source: IFAB Law 3: The Players.) Formations are all about strategy. If the team is playing an attacking strategy, they will play more players up - formations like 4-3-3 or 4-5-1. A more defensive formation would be something like 5-3-2 or 4-1-4-1. These would put more players in the backfield. However, there's nothing that restricts players to certain areas of the field based on their formation. You'll almost always see one or more midfielders help out on attacks, but you will sometimes see defenders come up to help as well. Defenders can be playing higher than midfielders (or even forwards) for a time, though they will usually return to the backfield - not because the rules say they have to but because in a formation it's good to be where you're supposed to be so your teammates can be where they're supposed to be. So, to answer your specific questions: 

I believe this matches your scenario almost exactly and thus, the run would count. This situation is reiterated in the definition of "Force Play" (pages 143-144). A Force Out is:
