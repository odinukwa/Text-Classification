Is there any work on Morse-Bott homology for infinite-dimensional manifolds (e.g. Hilbert manifolds). I am particularly interested in the case where we have a locally trivial fiber bundle and the Morse-Bott function is the function on the total space which is a pulled back Morse function on the base. 

Suppose $f$ is a Morse function on a Riemannian Hilbert manifold $M$. Let $p_{\pm}\in \text{Crit}(f)$ be given and fix some $u:R\rightarrow M$ which is an integral curve of $-\nabla f$ connecting $p_-$ and $p_+.$ Is it true that there is an open contractible set $U\subseteq M$ containing the image of $u$? 

Gromov's use of J-holomorphic curves in symplectic topology (he reinterpreted holomorphic functions in the sense of Vekua) as well as the invention of Floer homology (in order to deal with the Arnol'd conjecture). 

Is it possible to prove the (un)stable manifold theorem for rest points of hyperbolic vector fields without using suitable (infinite dimensional) Banach spaces? I am only aware of proofs that use certain spaces of curves or sequences which are infinite-dimensional. 

This is no answer, just a too long comment expressing my confusion. I am concerned your claim that one can define the "adjoint" of $d$ in terms of the Riesz representation theorem on Riemannian manifolds. I don't understand that. Take your favorite compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Then the exterior derivative is an operator $d:\Omega(M)\rightarrow \Omega(M),$ taking smooth forms to smooth forms. Thus, after suitable Sobolev completions, one can expect $d$ to be a bounded linear map between two Hilbert spaces. On the other hand, the Riesz representation theorem concerns bounded linear functionals on a Hilbert space $H$, i.e. bounded linear maps $H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}.$ It says that any such map is of the form $x\mapsto (x,y)$ for some $y\in H$ (where $(.,.)$ denotes the inner product on $H$). Consequently it is not applicaple to your problem. I could rather image you are concerned with the theorem on the Hilbert space adjoint. Here one is considering a bounded linear map $A:H_1\rightarrow H_2$ between two different Hilbert spaces. It says there is a bounded linear map $A^*:H_2\rightarrow H_1$ characterized uniquely by the relation $(Ax,y)_2=(x,A^*y)_1$ for any $x\in H_1$ and $y\in H_2$. In your example you want to apply it to the Hilbert space $H_1=H_2=L^2(\Lambda M),$ the space of square-integrable differential forms. Unfortunately, $d$ is not defined on all of $L^2(\Lambda M)$, but only on the space $W^{1,2}(\Lambda M),$ the space of square-integrable differentiable forms whose first derivative is also in $L^2$. Hence $d$ descends to an operator $d:W^{1,2}(\Lambda M)\rightarrow L^2(\Lambda M)$ and its adjoint is an operator $d^*:L^2(\Lambda M)\rightarrow W^{1,2}(\Lambda M)$. But this adjoint is NOT the operator you are looking for! 

Suppose $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n.$ Let $w\in H^{1,2}$ (standard Sobolev space, order 1, integrability 2) and $L>0$ be given. Is it then true that the function $w_L:=\min (L,w)$ is also in $H^{1,2}?$ I found this assertion in the book "Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis" of Jost, in the section concerning higher regularity of harmonic maps. There, one already knows that $f$ (the continuous weakly harmonic map) is in $H_{loc}^{1,4} \cap H^{2,2}_{loc}$ and considers $w:=|Df|^2.$ Now, the function $w_L$ can also be written as $x\mapsto w(x)\chi_L(w(x)),$ where $\chi_L$ denotes the characteristic function of the set consisting of all x s.t. $x\le L$. Considering the distributional derivative of $w_L$ gives you something involving a delta function(al), which is not in $L^2.$ Any suggestions? What am I doing wrong? 

It is well-known (see Kuiper's theorem) that every Hilbert space bundle over a manifold is trivial if the Hilbert space is truly infinite-dimensional. Does the same hold true if one considers locally trivial fiber bundles instead and the fiber is assumed to be a truly infinite dimensional Hilbert manifold? 

Well, the cotangent bundle is not "more natural" than the tangent bundle (but this obviously depends on what you mean by "natural"!). It simply has "more canonical structure" associated to it - namely the Liouville one-form that you mentioned. This comes from the fact that the cotangent bundle is dual to the tangent bundle. Hence you can take a tangent vector to the total space of the cotangent bundle, hit it with the differential and get a vector on the manifold you started out with - this vector can now be paired with the basepoint of the tangent vector you started out with, giving you essentially the Liouville (or canonical one-form). In contrast, there is no natural way to pair vectors (unless chosing an inner product); furthermore taking the cotangent of the projection reverses the direction of the mapping (it is "contravariant" in the sense of category theory). Moreover there are also interesting things about the tangent bundle that the cotangent bundle does not have - vectors! These vectors can be integrated to flows (at least locally) and allowing you to deal with dynamical systems on the manifold! This is not possible for forms! But of course, differentiating a function gives you a form (this can be checked, for instance, by looking at the transformation behaviour under chart changes). More generally the (principal) symbol of a linear partial differential operator is a (homogeneous) function on the cotangent bundle. That's also an important point (and causes the cotangent bundle to pop up in analysing PDE). 

I did not find a reference for the following question, so I will pose it here. I think the answer should be elementary. Let $F:X\rightarrow Y$ be a semi-Fredholm operator between Banach spaces, i.e. $\ker F$ is finite-dimensional and the image of $F$ is closed. Usually one wants to argue that $F$ is even Fredholm, thus exhibiting $\mathrm{coker} F:=Y/\mathrm{im} F$ as finite-dimensional. The usual argument involves the annihilator of the image of $F,$ which is easily seen to be isomorphic to $(\mathrm{coker}F)'$. More precisely, the annihilator of the image is connected to weak solutions of the (formally) adjoint operator. Once one has shown that the annihilator of the image is finite-dimensional (usually via ellipticity), it follows that the annihilator of the image is isomorphic to the cokernel of $F$. But I have also read sources where the cokernel is directly related to the annihilator of the image. Is it true that $(\mathrm{im} F)Â°\cong \mathrm{coker}F$ for the situation described above? It is certainly true if $X$ and $Y$ are Hilbert spaces. 

Let $G$ be a compact (connected) Lie group. Suppose that a $G$-principal bundle $\pi:P\rightarrow Q$ is given. Is it always possible to equip $P$ and $Q$ with Riemannian metrics, s.t. $\pi$ is totally geodesic? Notice that $g_P,$ the metric on $P,$ does not have to be $G$-invariant and $\pi$ does not have to be a Riemannian submersion. 

I think one answer ist to gain conceptual insight. Since Dirac it was usual to quantize via Classical theory in a Hamiltonian framework => Quantum theory Since there are a lot of problems with this approach (to QFT), it would be nice not to have to take the route over the classical theory. Hence the algebraic theory was born. Well, I attended a workshop on algebraic QFT last year - it is not my research area, though. They said that they are still looking very hard for a working model in 4d (they have good models for dimension 2 and 3). That's also the reason why you did not encounter any concrete computable examples. That's a critical issue - if they don't find a good model in the future, the field might be as good as dead (as a physics discipline). 

Given an arbitrary Hilbert manifold, can on find a complete Riemannian metric and a Morse function satisfying the Palais-Smale condition? 

I am only aware of results concerning singular symplectic reduction, i.e. when the Hamiltonian group action is not free and the quotient space is only a stratified symplectic space. The theorem is due to Sjamaar and Lerman ("Stratified symplectic spaces and reduction").
