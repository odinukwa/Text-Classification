And any other things that you veterans out there are thinking 'man, I wish someone would have told me that before I started using SC for the first time' All help is much appreciated :) 

This should be very simple. I have my Documents folders redirected to a share called //dc/documents. It creates a folder under this share for each person and then creates a folder under that for My Documents. The security permissions on this //dc/documents share are as follows: 

I have three forward lookup zones in my DNS server. When I try pinging a server that's part of lookup zone A from a computer that's part of that same zone, I get a response. If I try pinging a server that's not in the same zone as the computer I'm pinging from, I get nothing. When I try an nslookup of the servers that are not part of the same lookup zone, the names resolve correctly. If I append the domain onto the name, I can ping it just fine. Is there a way I can fix this? or do I need to keep appending the domain onto the name if the computer I'm trying to ping is not of the same domain as me? 

I've got an RODC in our local site and a PDC in our co-location facility. I run SET on any of the computers in our local site and they all say LOGONSERVER='PDC'. They should all be authenticating to the local RODC but they don't seem to want to. I looked at the logs of the RODC and I get a few spaced out errors coming from NETLOGON: 

I've got an interesting one... My users have always typed in 'mail' to get to their mail. There was an internal DNS A record that resolved that to the IP of the mail server. I'm putting in an Exchange server to replace that. In order for people to get their mail, I try putting in an A record that does the same thing as the previous one. When I try to get to OWA, it tells me that the certificate on the server is not trusted. I only have the names: 

alright, I've got one that should be really simple. I want a wide open smb share for my Windows 7 machine. Everyone should be able to access it, regardless of domain or username or anything. My smb.conf has: 

I'm sitting here across the office from Bob, who is logged into the domain right now, working away. I pull up AD Admin Center and take a look at Bob's account and it tells me his last log on date is 10/25/2010 at noon. It's currently 11/2/2010 at 10 in the morning. My date on my server is correct, the date on his computer is correct...What's going on? 

First of all, everyone's on Exchange 2010 using OWA I have a dynamic distribution list that contains all users in my domain called 'staff'. I can send to this list, other people can send to this list, but I have one user that cannot send to this list. Sending to this list gives the user an email back with the error: 

I have a Cisco ASA that I have VPN tunnels to connect my internal Windows network. I ran into some trouble logging into my domain so I unblocked all the ports on that internal interface. On a previous question posted here, the general consensus was that I should be blocking ports on my inside interface but my question is: what ports should I unblock? I've tried unblocking ports 88, 139, 135, 389, and 445 and Windows logins still give me problems. Is there some MS documentation somewhere that tells me what I need to unblock to allow Windows logins and other things? 

I have my users appdata (roaming) stored on a external server in the location that they're normally in. I have some users that are in two locations equally. This provides a problem when someone tries to open up Firefox on a computer in a location other than where their appdata is stored, it takes forever. Is there a way that I can clone the redirected appdata (roaming) folder to two locations and have the folder redirection look for appdata (roaming) based on the location that the user is at? 

I have three USB ports on my Cisco ASA 5505. All Cisco documentation that I've found says that they're for 'future use'. Anyone know if this has been updated? Or if it will be? 

It works! When I was looking in the restore section of Windows Server Backup, it didn't show the documents. But, I did a little test-recovery of my own files and the folder with my documents showed up with all of the documents inside. The user that is doing the backups has to be a part of the backup operators group. That group can evidently backup documents that it doesn't have access too. Hope this helps someone in the future :) 

We solved this and got the files back. Under the advice of AWS support, I created an EBS snapshot of the storage gateway volume, restored it as an EBS volume, attached it to a fairly beefy EC2 instance and ran the chkdsk from there. Because it was an EBS volume directly attached to a computer and not going over storage gateway or WAN to do the chkdsk, it ran much faster than doing it other ways (still took days to run the chkdsk on 6TB of data on a 10TB volume). When the chkdsk finished and we confirmed that we had access to the files from the EC2 instance, we snapshotted the volume and restored it to our on-prem storage gateway. Moral of the story - if you're using storage gateway, know that file systems can be corrupted in the cloud and schedule snapshotting on your volumes in case it happens. 

EDIT One Exchange server inside the network that acts as a transport server, client access server and mailbox server and one Edge Transport server in the DMZ. 

I have a cisco ASA 5505 with three interfaces: Internal (100), DMZ (50) and External (0). The internal has a IPSEC VPN tunnel to my internal network I couldn't log in to my domain because of all of the port restrictions and such. I tried monitoring the traffic through the interface, seeing what it's blocking and then unblocking those ports but even then it didn't work completely correctly I finally just added a rule to permit any ip traffic from any network to any network on the internal interface and, of course, it worked fine But is that good security practice? Should I be blocking ports on an interface that's internal and over a VPN with the highest security level? 

Ok, so I've been dealing with this for a while and I'm sorry if it seems like I'm asking the same question over and over (it sure feels like I am) Is there a way for my users to run the LDAP query that populates a dynamic distribution list from their machine to see a kind of 'preview' of the members in the group before sending their email to that list? 

I've been looking for a way to update third-party software on my client computers for a while. I want to do some monitoring, push Windows updates for my client computers and push updates for things like Flash, Java and my virus scanning software. Eventually I want to push programs like Office out to some of my client computers. It's my understanding that SC will serve these purposes, so I have a few questions for it. 

The %APPDATA% is stored on an external server on my network (that I can ping to without problems). I am missing a ton of PS cmdlets too, which I'm presuming are stored in '*.format.ps1xml' I tried finding the directory in which format.ps1xml is supposed to reside on the external server and it's not even created. Can someone tell me where to start? 

I'm having some problems with Autodiscover. I have the SCP, I have the correct cert and it's still not working. I'm out of ideas, anyone got one? Result of "Test E-mail AutoConfiguration" in Outlook 07 

Thank you Chris S and minamhere for your responses but I must not have been clear on what I was trying to accomplish. I was actually looking to suppress the welcome screen that asks users about the update settings and such. I found that if a user clicks the biggest button there (use recommended settings) it asks them for an admin username and password. My solution was the Office 2010 ADM template. Download, add it to your GPO and enable the "Suppress recommended settings dialog" policy and it works like a charm :) 

I set up my folder redirection with the "Grant Users Exclusive Rights to ..." checked. Now I'm trying to get to someone's AppData folder to fix a Firefox profile issue and I can't. What I want to know: if I uncheck "Grant Users Exclusive Rights to ..." in my GPO and let it propegate, will that give administrators access to those folders? 

If I go into the email accounts in control panel, click the account, repair it and then open Outlook, it opens right up. Has anyone else seen this issue while forcing non-cached mode in Outlook? 

I have an HP LaserJet 4 Plus that I'd like to be able to map (TCP/IP) to my users. I have to give a location for the printer so that the client computer knows where to find the driver. This would be no problem if I add the x86 printer drivers to the Print server properties section of my server and pointed the GPO to the printer installed on my (x64) server. The problem arises when I go to HP's site to find the .inf file required to install this additional x86 driver. The site tells me to just use the in-built drivers that come with Windows. I've done that in order to install the printer to my server, but it gives me x64 drivers. I need to install the x86 drivers. When I attempt to do this using the in-built drivers (right-click printer > printer properties > sharing > Additional Drivers...) it always asks me for a location of the driver that I wish to install. Where are the built-in Windows drivers that are used so I can point this dialog box to that or Where can I get the x86 .inf for this printer?
