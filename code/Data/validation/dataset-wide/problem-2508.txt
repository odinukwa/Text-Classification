It has, like most ritual with material sacrifies, not really a connection to the Buddha-Dhamma, aside of the possible devotion and sacrify, metta and compassion, to ones ancestors, deities or spirits, which are possible wholesome deeds and generally praised by the Buddha (sacrifies for deities and ancestors) It's a very usual ritual, mostly performed by people with Chinese or Vietnamese ancestors all over SEAsia on Chinese fest days and has it's origin in certain Asian ancestor-cults and religions. Earlier real money was used which of course is mostly not legal, so copies and fake prints are usually used to be burned in front of the houses. As a one of a childs "duty" torward death relatives: 

Strong believe of the fact of rebirth comes from seeing. A firm believe is a matter of entering the stream. And no, seeing things as they arise and decay, is not a matter of craving but requires the opposit. 

My person would wonder how alternativ speculations would manifest if thinking on "Where I am from?" with all that individual and unique features. Would it even cause more suffering as the answers thoughts and approach? Where or what, are you thinking, that you are from? Maybe you remember if concentration is clear and undisturbed. Of course that requires certain traing and given path. But maybe simply try, to know for you self, even here & now. For this Dhamma is to be realize for oneself, for the wise, open to get taimed.

The question(s) certainly state merely a view rather to ask something, how ever, this view(s) seems to confuse a lot, basicly two things: Believe with fact. If one believes that his action has no effects, or at least hopes so, does not change the fact of it. So when mixing up, and stay just on theoretical ways, not really looking for one self, one tends to take on various views and turn around on them.

It's good to reflect Dhamma while driving and be mindful. Let my person tell a merely personal story: Once my person was still a householder, a young successful employer, enjoyed to compfortable drive in the "bigges" car of his town, smooth, relacted, V8, no need to push the gas, just driving to the next meeting, 100 of thousand km a year, he got much aware of that * flap * * flap *, on the windows surface on a lonly road. Reflecting a little more of what is the case of such disaster, he reduced his drives an seeks for more. Later even took on the bike and focused on work not to far. After he actually left this all behind, he saw, that if he uses others for a ride, it is sometimes even more worse, so he thought, what if not greed, would one hinder just to simply walk. Even later, he observed the struggles people have with shoes and how less one in shoes, compfortable, "protective", takes care of his steps. Of course it gives certain freedom to look here and there, but what does one looking for, while under the shoes other are just smashed? At least, it carries a lot of freedom, if not depending on "protection" and "compfort" and not only that one mostly is much more flexible, much more able to move and even faster as an aeroplain in calculating right, one able to train mindfulness by each and every step, has, if not more, the gain of freedom of remorse made his possession, a liberty not easy to gain, but just step by step. Of course the "story" is much deeper, but maybe this short cut gives good reason for possible less build on "equanimity" but take on the road of letting go, reduce and sacrifies, step by step. Maybe some inspirations are also found in some words my person wrote some times ago: Who is the winner in the Traffic of life?. As for the question again: being mindful on the frames of references, even while driving, is not dangerous but actually good. If it how ever, does not lead to certain insight about the drive behind the drive, does not really lead to disenchantment in regard of having a nice drive, certainly the task might be not right made and can, in this case, be of course dangerous in all aspects. A nice first step into Dhamma might be also "Step by Step, by late Ven. Ghosananda. 

That's like asking "what should I eat". If liking to taste, here are the 40 meals, or better working places: Kammaṭṭhāna For which one might be good for your tendency it would be best to look after a skilled meditation teacher but generally the ten recollections, best starting from below (and develope proper perception for them) are fine for one living at home, as well as the Brahma-viharas, later on. What ever might be pleasing for the mind to go with it best possible without much laps.

It's good to practice in areas where such can be susbected, and its most importand to do such on places where people have joy in giving and sharing merits, rather to see good deeds and joy with it as a tabu and childish. Something that is of course not easy not find in modern sociaties. It's all, incl. the skill of giving, a matter of right view, and associating inwardly and outwardly with it. A matter that is how ever not spoken of, is also how monks, in this case, are paying gratitude to given special food and it should be a warn sign, if people approach with "all is anicca" 

For the first point, Theravadin cosmology doesn't contradict any known laws (e.g. conservation of energy or non-decreasing entropy). Does Theravadin cosmology make any further predictions about things which we can measure but don't yet have a complete theory of? If so then there's a chance we could develop our theory and find Theravadin cosmology to be impossible. If not then we can't use this approach to question Theravadin cosmology. For the second point, we really have to speculate about what we might or might not be able to measure in the future. Because this is based on speculation I don't think this counts as a good reason to believe that physics will end up allowing a Buddhist timeline of events. 

Well done, you have realised intellectually that things are impermanent but you are still attached. Intellectual knowledge doesn't end attachment (but it can help). To end attachment we need real knowledge, with real knowledge you will instinctively know that things are impermanent. I think you have switched from attachment to having a relationship to attachment to not having a relationship. Whether you have or don't have a relationship is not the point, the point is how we think when do/don't have a relationship. While you are in a relationship there is some pleasure from love. You can experience this pleasure with wisdom and work towards your relationship with wisdom. Doing it with wisdom means that you know that it is impermanent so you can do it without attachment. Don't forget that you can be attached to single life too and that also causes dukkha. You think that if you're single you can control your relationship status and make yourself constantly single, but this is also impermanent and can't be controlled so it is a source of dukkha. Edit: Real knowledge is quite like an instinct, it is effortless. With intellectual knowledge we have to remember what we learned and then use thinking apply that to the situation, it's slow and takes a lot of effort. For example, if you know intellectually that things are impermanent then if you drop a glass and it breaks your initial reaction will be "Damn I liked that glass, now I've lost it", you are suffering at this point but then you remember "Everything changes, the glass had to break so I never could control it". This thinking might reassure you and calm you down. If you have real knowledge of impermanence like an enlightened person then before the glass breaks you are not viewing the glass as something which inherently exists, it's a temporary phenomena. When the glass breaks it has no effect on you because you never thought of the glass as being not-broken. 

Horoscopes existed in many cultures, the reason why it remained more prevalent in Buddhist countries is more down to speculation. It depends both on Buddhism and on other religions' attitude towards horoscopes. Some reasons might be: 

Any sect of Buddhism which emphasises the emptiness of all things probably says that there are no existent wholes but some sects would say that there are conventionally existent wholes. In other words, we can only talk about their existence from a conventional perspective. Here's a nice description which talks about a car's existence and its emptiness 

The requisites for trade are not requirements for trading, they are four objects which are traded. They are four items which are required for monastic living, namely clothing, food, medicine and shelter. 

It is possible but as there are a lot of types of breath meditation it may not be possible to do your type. If you do breath meditation for samatha remember that the point is to develop calm, the point isn't to see how long your can focus on your breath. So if you have to focus on your task a bit that's not a bad thing as long as you do it calmly. If what you are doing is a simple task you can largely be aware of your breath while you do the action in the background. If you are doing a complicated task then you'll have to put a lot of attention on the task but keep an awareness of the breath in the background which you can frequently go back to momentarily to remind you of equanimity, in that way the breath is like a refuge. Compared to sitting in a quiet room, during daily activities there is a lot going on and your attention is probably jumping from a sight to a sound to a smell and then to another sight. Some people use this to observe impermanence; as you inhale notice the sense arising in your awareness, as you exhale notice how what you are aware of has changed. 

When the Buddha searched for truth in the world he used a method of empiricism. Empiricism is the precursor for modern science and although I believe that rebirth can be verified empirically I am not certain that is qualifies as a scientific theory. The exact theory I am referring to is that rebirth is a mental process which occurs during our life and continues after physical death. Although I do not think that rebirth is contrary to scientific evidence I do wonder if it is a theory which can be considered scientific. One requirement for theories in modern science is that they are falsifiable which means that if they are wrong then we can show that they are wrong. Usually theories predict things and we can test if those predictions are false, however, I cannot think of any predictions which can be tested in this life. This is assuming that one has a very still mind and can observe fundamental processes. I understand that this is related to the twelve nidanas and the stages when clinging leads to becoming which leads to birth. Is it possible for somebody to know what they should be seeing here before they see it?
