ZioByte, touched on it, but a large laser array could do the trick. But it doesn't have to destroy the asteroid, merely heat it to the point of vaporizing part of the asteroid. This vapor will act as a small jet deflecting the asteroid from Earth. 

Mixed Reactions? As alluded to by Ian, some would approach with caution, while others, as alluded to by Gary, would be far more bullish. Remain Cautious There are untold reasons why one should be cautious, not the least of which is the potential for world destroying paradoxes. Unknown effects on our physical world We would have no way of knowing what potential disaster could unfold from use of this technology. Could it tear at the very fabric of space and time, ripping apart our world? Was it merely luck that the chrononaut who has to come to visit us from the future even made it here in the first place without causing irreparable damage? Whether or not these thoughts would occur to Presidents, MPs or Senators, they would come to the minds of scientists and activists that sit on advisory panels or leader multinational NGOs, and international research institutes. As such there would be a healthy body of people pressuring leaders into methodically researching any potential adverse effects of the technology on the user, and the world as a whole. Temporal War It's not just present day world governments who might seek power, and meddling in the affairs of the chrononaut and his technology might cause an outrage in the future leading to potential repercussive actions. I am thinking of a few Star Trek plots which revolve around guardians of space-time who prevent any interference in timelines. Who can say whether or not any attempted interfering with the time traveler and his technology isn't being monitored in the future. Governments would be right to be concerned with this possibility. Time Paradoxes I wont even go into detail as I think he are aware of this. But For reasons similar to ' Unknown effects on our physical world' I can see a fair amount of public pressure to investigate these. presumable some dialogue would occur between our time traveler and world governments on their own findings from the future on these issues, but I am sure we would try and verify them for the sake of understanding and reassurance. Neutral For a variety of reasons some nations would probably have little reaction to the news. Denial There reasons are varied, whether it would count as blasphemy, or it comes across as an impossibility, majorities in some nations would assuredly refuse to believe it as a true event. Apathetic Acceptance Some governments would accept this as a true, and move on with the matter of the day do to overwhelming pressure to deal with current and very troubling affairs. It may become a back burner issue for nations dealing with disease and famine (even if it presents an opportunity to resolve these issues another way) Take Control More to Gary's point, whether open about it, or keeping it a secret, undoubtedly some nations will seek to control what is the greatest potential military and economic leap forward ever presented to mankind. Some may openly call for its control to have a tool to help prevent complete exploitation by those in the future who now many control our past and as such our futures. This could easily lead to both unilateral and multilateral actions to attempt and control this technology. Some would seek the technology to gain the upper hand against present day enemies. They may even use the guise of controlling the technology to counter those from future, while truly maintaining eyes on today. Whether or not that is through force or negotiation is inevitably up to the whims of your nations, and the perceived nature of the time traveler. Militarily Those who have the power may try through military means to gain access to the technology and time traveler. Covertly More interesting would be those who seek to control it covertly. I could see nations trying to bribe or seduce the time traveler to gain access. Or perhaps nations look forward, planning multi-generational infiltration plans to gaining access to the not-yet-invented machine. To that point perhaps out time traveler is a spy from one of these programs (The paradoxes begin) 

This page at the The Internet Speculative Fiction Database — I don’t know what good it is. This page at Asimov Wiki — I don’t know what good it is. 

Now suppose that $\mathrm{O_5}$ is stable at standard atmospheric pressure and temperature.  And suppose that, like ice-nine, it acts as a catalyst, converting $\mathrm{O_2}$ (and maybe also $\mathrm{O_3}$) into $\mathrm{O_5}$, and that this conversion is very hard to undo (think particle accelerator).  It would be quite reasonable to expect $\mathrm{O_5}$ not to react chemically the way $\mathrm{O_2}$ does (remember the differences between the characteristics of diamonds and graphite).  Once this stuff got into the lungs of an oxygen breather, it would convert all the ordinary oxygen (including, eventually, the stuff in hemoglobin) into $\mathrm{O_5}$, which would not give the cells what they need.  You’d suffocate. Or maybe it’s just very, very bad for you — like ozone. I don’t know how $\mathrm{O_5}$ would be created with pre-WWI technology, but the existence of tetraoxygen $(\mathrm{O_4})$ was first predicted in 1924 as a result of experiments with liquid oxygen — so that technology existed then.  You would need very little handwavium to explain how somebody cooled oxygen, past the point where it condenses into a liquid, near to its freezing temperature, and this caused $\mathrm{O_5}$ crystals to form.  When allowed to thaw, they did not decompose, but rather started a Cat’s Cradle-like chain reaction that converted all the oxygen on the planet into toxic $\mathrm{O_5}$. 

This is a little crude, in more ways than one.  Perhaps somebody can suggest improvements to (cough cough) clean it up. First of all, they’ll want to have a reservoir (or cistern) at (or, more likely, below) ground level.  This would allow them to capture and hold spring water temporarily, in case the spring and/or the pumping mechanism have varying flow rates.  (I’ll get back to that.)  If they’re collecting rainwater at ground level, they’re probably already doing this. As in initial capability, immediately after the apocalypse (or maybe even before), this could be as simple as a pond around the spring.  Given time to establish some infrastructure, there should probably be such a cistern in each building; this provides some security against bandits/raiders.  Rig something so that the water from the spring runs through pipes or other channels into the holding tanks in the basements of the buildings.  (Try to make it hard for attackers to slip poison into the reservoirs.) One added security measure is “security through obscurity” — after you have built a plumbing system that pipes the spring water into the buildings, bury it.  This may make it somewhat harder for adversaries to steal your water or tamper with the system.  Ideally, it will make the spring invisible. The question of getting the water to the upper floors remains.  Renan suggested a “bucketwheel”: 

Concealing the construction of a tunnel Constructing the tunnel in a limited time-frame Moving troops without being noticed Protecting the tunnel until the sea/air bases can be dealt with 

You want to leave a mark, but let's try to avoid mutilating and otherwise making useless potential future reformed members of society. So how do we do this? Alopecia Various toxicans can induce hairloss, including permentant and complete hairloss. An individual withnot even a strand of peach fuzz will be noticeable though its more subtle then a missing ear. Scleral Tattooing Want something more striking, how about a scleral tattoo? You can't remove an eye tattoo without obvious and severe side effects and different colored eyes can be used to separate prisoners from staff. 

Simplest thing I can think of is the existence of large and dangerous ocean creatures, large horned whales and the like. Perhaps they are attracted to the movement of the ships on the surface and track them once they enter the deeper waters where they reside. 

Blessed Trinkets From the Church Perhaps you could expand the notion of the soul binding to a body over the course of life, to include any object person keeps close to them at all times. Individuals could keep amulets or rings, blessed by the church, that are meant to protect their soul for some time after death. The length of time for which an amulet will last depends on the materials. The degree to which they can keep the soul safe from supernatural forces may also depend on materials or the level of blessing placed upon it. And of course you could use the price of such protections to generate revenue for the church or if you want to limit who can get their hands on such protection. 

The upside is the Germans get to do what they do best, Blitz. While perhaps not the most realistic plan, its one you have fun with, and does get around some limitations the Germans faced. 

Tunnel Without air or water superiority, why not go by land? The service tunnel connecting England with the Europe took two years or so to complete. It may have been built with better technology granted, but it was also built to a higher standard, wherein the Germans could produce a hasty short-lived tunnel. Some, perhaps dubious, estimates even being placed at 16 months With a land route available, a naval and air distraction could help conceal the movement of Germans tanks. Once they arrive on the island the Germans can exercise their blitzkrieg tactics, focusing on seizing air and naval bases. There are clearly a lot of issues with this plan: 

Assuming this is a low tech setting, so it isn't possible to produce plasma, perhaps the plasma users need to collect and store naturally occurring plasma from thunderstorms. Or by some huge collective effort/ritual to pull down a chunk of the sun. Then a group of plasma users works in shifts to maintain a large ball of plasma, and members of the group can take a bit of the plasma store to work with. The plasma users effectively have energy shields / weapons so they are very powerful. They can also convert any other matter into plasma, but this cools the plasma they're holding until it eventually reverts to gas and they're powerless. Overall they're the most powerful at their peak, but this is balanced by limited 'ammunition' and a need to cooperate for supplies. 

It was something that was brought up, but it was fairly quickly debunked. The concern was not about a chemical reaction (the atmosphere is pretty chemically inert as its two main constituents don't tend to react with each other). Rather they were worried that a nuclear chain reaction of either nitrogen-nitrogen fusion or nitrogen-hydrogen fusion (with the hydrogen being supplied by boiling the oceans and disassociating the water). Here's a contemporary paper about it, showing that it won't happen: $URL$ Roughly speaking, they show that at any temperature the heat radiated away is greater than the heat added by nitrogen-nitrogen fusion reactions, given the density of nitrogen in the atmosphere and assuming that any physical collision of sufficient energy results in fusion (because they did not know the true reaction cross section). This means that energy is always lost so the reaction cannot be self sustaining. They also showed that N-H physical collisions are less likely and that other processes they haven't accounted for take more energy out, so overall they show that it doesn't happen even taking generous assumptions in favour of it happening. So I'm afraid the answer is you can't under the real laws of physics with an earth like atmospheric composition. If you can put large quantities of something flammable or fusible/fissile into the atmosphere then it becomes much easier, obviously. If we're not talking about the real world and you want to change the laws of physics in a way that isn't too noticeable, then perhaps something like increasing the size of atomic nuclei so fusion interactions become more likely would make the situation the scientists feared possible (ignoring the knock on effects in stars etc). 

If we're allowing time dilation, perhaps we could just send people straight into sagittarius A* towards the end of their life, so that from the point of view of the rest of the galaxy they never die (Lets ignore what happens in their own frame of reference). Then we can get on with the task of converting the galaxies mass into people. There is about $10^{41}$kg of normal matter in the galaxy (I'm assuming you can't turn dark matter into people), so I think $10^{39}$ people might be an absolute upper limit, giving us ~30kg of energy per person for our extensive breeding and transport program.
