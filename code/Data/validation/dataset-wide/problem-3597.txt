You will not be able to make sure the bar is in the correct position with the pad in place. Remove the pad and feel the bar going across the back resting just beside the spine of the scapula. That position is also a much stronger position than up on the neck or top of the traps. The bar is more balanced and is not likely to roll on you unless you have it too high or too low. You will also never have the blood vessel problem in that area. 

If you are dumping the bar every time, you are going to failure--not AMRAP. There is a big difference. Every place I've seen AMRAP defined, it's as many good reps as possible, with 1-2 reps left in the tank. If form breaks down, or you aren't getting to full depth, your set needs to be over. That said, I have experienced the light-headedness you are talking about after widowmakers. In my case, it was a combination of factors: excessive heat in the gym and insufficient food. I was shaking pretty badly after the exertion, and every calorie I consumed after that helped the feeling subside. When you have the feeling, do sit down and rest until the worst feeling passes. Don't keep going on the session. If you keep going, you risk hurting yourself. High rep sets are very taxing on your body, both from the perspective of getting enough oxygen to your body and from the glycogen depletion that goes on. The good news is that the lower weight is usually easier to recover from--as long as you don't go to failure. 

I'd like to clarify a very important point: both men and women have testosterone and estrogen, however the proportions and functions are different in each. An article on whether "BioSignature" holds water against science had some interesting facts regarding the role of testosterone and estrogen in men and women: 

There is no reason why you shouldn't eat shortly before going to bed as long as you remain within your nutritional requirements for the whole day. There has been no study I'm aware of that has shown any correlation with food timing and body composition. There is a clear correlation with body composition and food content. The biggest concern is with sleep quality and food content. There are reasons to eat after exercise: 

NOTE: your lettuce/cabbage has very low calories and generally runs 1g fibre/100g product -- 1g net carbs. It's a good filler. You are going to get your best results in the dark green vegetables. The good news is you also get a number of vitamins and minerals your body needs from these vegetables. Unfortunately, you won't find anything with an incredible 9g fibre that doesn't have a commensurate amount of other carbs. Something you may do while you are cutting carbs is to use Fibre supplements. I've been able to find some that give me 4g fibre/serving with a net 2g carbs. That can help a lot. 

For example, losing 5 lbs of fat is a good short term goal if you have a way of measuring body fat. If not, go by total body weight. I have found that as I got older and heavier, high impact activities like running/jogging are really not going to work for me. Some tips from Alex Viada for guys over 185 lbs include: 

They are light enough not to cause over-training, unless you are an advanced lifter. However, they provide stresses on your joints that are not natural. Depending on what you are doing and how forcefully you are moving, they can cause damage to your elbow and shoulder joints or force a stretch you aren't ready for. I had a Sensei who trained with those things on hands and feet against his Sensei's advice. After many years of the added stress on his joints (punching and kicking), he had to have both his hips replaced. If all you are doing is making coffee in the morning with those things, you'll probably be OK. Just be careful if you get the bright idea to do anything that requires force or quick movements. 

There's no right or wrong answer on when you decide to use a belt, but there is a right and wrong way to use it. Based on studies, you can lift more with a belt, and core strength is similarly engaged both with and without the belt. Eventually, you should wear a belt for the work sets. The important thing is that you learn how to use it properly as a training tool, and don't think of it as a safety net. The truth is, you can get injured wearing a belt and those injuries will be worse mostly because you can lift more than you can without it. You need a strong core either way. When shopping for a belt, look for these things: 

So far everything looks good on your spreadsheet. If you want to cut fat, you may consider swapping the leg meat for breast meat. The white meat of a chicken is leaner, which improves the protein to fat ratio. It also makes it more difficult to cook correctly, too little cooking and you risk getting sick, too much cooking and it becomes dry. That said, in my experience fat is less damaging to weight loss than carbs. We're only talking 3g of fat here. Your body is going to work harder to convert fat to useable energy than it will with sugar. That's a good thing. I'm not sure how much Olive Oil you have translates to volume (i.e. ml instead of grams), but you may compensate by cutting 3g of Olive Oil if the excess fat truly concerns you. I will say that Olive Oil, a mono-unsaturated fat, is going to be healthier for you so I would just keep it. I would be concerned less with the exact numbers, or you are going to drive yourself crazy. As long as you are close, you will lose weight and you will remain healthy. 3g is a 5% difference between your ideal of 58g and your actual of 61g of fat. I'd say that's an acceptable margin of error. 

The biggest indicator will be where you collect the most fat. Men tend to collect in their abdomen while women tend to collect in their hips and thighs. That varies based on body type and genetic factors. Botttom line is that you know where that area is. 

I'm going to start off with that there is no universally best routine. Only what is most appropriate for you given your level of training, physical development, and your goals. Advice in the world of bodybuilding (i.e. hypertrophy work), opinions are so severely divided that it's even hard to compile a list of routines. That's probably due to the fact a number of bodybuilders go to the gym with a rough idea of what they want to accomplish, and the rest kind of falls into place after that. The best thing I can recommend is hire a coach who has had good results from his clients, and see if you can get 3rd party opinions about his coaching results and style. They will help you figure out exactly what is going to work for you. However, to that end I do have to outline a couple of things: 

If your only goal is strength, and you are getting at least 1g protein per pound body weight, then all the extra calories will be used for energy. Whether you use fat or carbs, your body still uses those macronutrients for energy. This sounds quite compatible with Mark Rippetoe's view on dietary requirements. I think in many ways Rip's recommendations are overstated, because if you eat a lot more than you need, you will gain a good amount of fat along with your new muscle. That in turn makes it hard to move, and use your strength. To help keep things in balance, make sure your exercise has the following components: 

You have an injury that needs to heal You have a form problem that needs to be fixed or you will simply keep re-injuring yourself. 

In short, if you are doing something, anything, you will make positive steps toward fitness. The problem with stopping there, is that usually the something people choose, doesn't maintain their interest. This can be a result of not perceiving any benefit, or shear boredom. Your goals are stated in this way: 

Essentially, on intensity day you are increasing the max you can do. With Madcow, intensity day is always 5-10lbs more than volume day, and your next volume day you do at the weight you used for your last intensity day. With TM, you change the weight on volume day when you feel you need to, but always increase from intensity day to intensity day. This variation works well when you need a week to get stronger and do more. Monthly Variation There are plenty of templates that work here, but the one I like best is the Wendler progression. All percentages are your training max for the cycle. Reps x Percentage notation used. Note: the '+' sign is used for As Many Reps As Possible (AMRAP), saving a rep in the tank when you are done. 

The key point is to get all the work in. You can improve over time, and probably the best bet is to keep shortening the rest times until you can get through everything. If you have to take a longer break, like 5-10m between cycles of work, that's fine when you are getting started. Now, one of the aspects of "insanity" and P90X brands of HIIT is that you attempt to improve your work capacity with the intervals. No matter what you are doing: burpees, tire flipping, sledge hammer work, snatches, etc.--as you get stronger, and your body gets used to the conditioning aspect of the HIIT, it will become easier. Your heart rate will come down to normal more quickly, and your body won't get tired as easily. 

In order to understand how Atkins and other ketogenic diets work, you need to understand a bit about energy systems and a very important pair of hormones. Oversimplifying things quite a bit, we can get to a layman's understanding of what's going on. Essentially, there are three sources of energy the body can pull from: 

Understand that a no-carb diet is not sustainable forever, and increases the load on your liver and kidneys. At most, 3-4 months. The problems with the diet you proposed 

My sensei used to work out with ankle weights and wrist weights when he was younger. This was against his sensei's advice. He would keep doing it until they wore out (and shot the metal bars out the bottom when he was kicking a target), and then replace the weights. The bottom line is that the body is not meant to deal with those additional stress of that weight at the extremities. He ended up having to get both hips replaced later in life due to the unnatural stresses the ankle/wrist weights put on his body. If you do add weight, use something like a weighted vest. It provides a more natural balance of weight and doesn't interfere with the normal motion of your legs and arms. Additionally, you can add more weight when it is close to your body than you can at your ankles and wrists, providing a better advantage. That said, I agree with Ivo's advice: find more excuses to walk more during the day. 

So the 5 million dollar question is: what is general fitness? The secondary question that is equally important, is how do I make it interesting? To answer the first question, the best way to define general fitness is to break it down into its main parts: 

The idea here is to demand more of your muscles so you can build them up, and feed them protein so they can increase. 

In a very real sense, you may be reading more into these numbers than is there. First and foremost, our bodies are designed to be efficient at maintaining its operation. That includes the amount of body fat you have, how much energy it expends, etc. Your body has adapted to the approximately 2000 Calories you are consuming. At your activity level, height and weight, I wouldn't venture much below that at all, though. There are a few important nutritional guidelines to consider: 

In an ATG squat you are going down until your calves are in contact with your hamstrings. Simple physics state that two physical objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time, and the stronger you are the more they will push against each other -- limiting the absolute depth you can physically achieve. Should you add weight? When you squat, is the crease of your hips at or below the top of your knee? If you've reached this level of flexibility, you can squat with weight and it will be beneficial for you. In many ways adding weight can help your flexibility by pushing you a little deeper than you can in bodyweight alone. I should also mention that your back should not be rounded excessively in the lower lumbar region. I'm not talking about the minimal tuck that is normal at the bottom, I'm talking about leaning too far forward like a clamshell. Should you really pursue ATG? That's a personal choice, but the benefits of squats in developing the posterior chain begin when you get the crease of your hip below parallel with the top of your knee. Going so deep that your calves now add pressure to the back of your knee while you are weighted might not be such a great idea. The only competition that judges you on squat depth would be power lifting, and you are only required to get your hips below parallel with your knee. Olympic lifters tend to go deeper, but that is to get under a heavy clean or snatch. Their foot position is also a bit different than a power lifters. If you want to go for a more Olympic style squat, that's admirable. Understand that the way you set up affects what you can do. The Oly squat is high bar, with the torso as erect as possible. The knees typically travel a bit more forward and require a higher degreee of ankle dorsiflexion. Good Oly lifting shoes help a great deal with any squatting, but particularly with the high bar Olympic squat. 

You can treat it as a menu of assistance work. For example, if your lower back is pretty taxed before you start deadlift assistance, you might want to stick with snatch grip deadlifts or romanian deadlifts. If you are feeling good and want a challenge go with the opposite stance or double pause variations. Also, as assistance work, touch and go is perfectly fine. In fact with longer rep sets, it's about the only real way to do it. 

There are different levels of recovery. The one most people think about is the rest between sessions. When your training is arranged well, you will be recovered enough to do the prescribed work the next session. The one not everyone thinks about is the time between sets. The principle is the same, you want to be recovered enough to do the prescribed sets and reps. The longer the rest the less training density, and the shorter the rest the higher the training density. The minimum rest between sets is there to ensure you can do all the work prescribed for the whole training session. If the minimum rest is 1 minute, and you only rest 15 seconds, chances are you won't be able to complete the final sets. Rest is your primary fatigue management tool. If you feel like you are more fatigued than usual after a set, extend your rest time. Sometimes we have off days, we can't operate at 100% all the time. Sometimes the work increases a bit more than we are ready for. The rest between sets helps you deal with it better. As a general rule, I tend to have shorter rest times, but there are days where I have to extend the rest a bit more than usual.
