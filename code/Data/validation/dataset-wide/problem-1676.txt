Paul Sullins is in fact not just a priest, he works with the Family Research Council, which is designated as a hate group by the SPLC. The FRC thinks that homosexuality is "harmful", "can never be affirmed", and is "by definition unnatural, and as such is associated with negative physical and psychological health effects". They oppose acceptance of homosexuality in "law, in the media, and in schools". Same-sex parenting The APA answers the broader question regarding same-sex parenting: 

The methodology they used has been criticized by Blinkhorn in Nature, especially for excluding a study from Mexico. Lynn and Irwing rejected the criticism. Other A study by Nyborg from 2003 finds a sex difference in intelligence and tries to explain why other studies don't: 

Snopes checked these numbers, using a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence: 

The source is a far-right website associated with the fascist Sweden Democrats, so there is some doubt left about the facts (especially about the 80% figure "revealed" by a random dental hygienist, which seems to be unsupported). As not even these sites are actually claiming that a dental hygienist was fired for "revealing" that migrants are fraudulently posing as children, it is fair to assume that it is not true. 

What Clinton is saying here is that she scheduled a meeting with Blair at the same time as a meeting Blair had with Rothschild, and she wants to apologize for that - because that is the polite thing to do, not because Rothschild is secretly controlling her. Conclusion Yes, Clinton did write this to Rothschild, to apologize for a scheduling conflict. 

This is obviously false. There was never a time in Germany where only two flags where allowed. Wikipedia has a list of official flags used in Germany between 1933 and 1945, which were of course legal at the time, and a number of them neither contain the swastika, nor are blue and white (for example the flag of the SS). Where the claim comes from The book Livingstone referenced is "Zionism in the Age of the Dictators" by Lenni Brenner. The relevant part is this: 

The Business Insider article as well as this post by Philip Cohen reject the interpretation of the image for various reasons, among them the tiny sample size (especially regarding black women, because of the relative small black population in the US). The 2008 survey for example works with data containing less than 10 cases of black on white rape, and less than 20 cases of rape of black people (total). The image then extrapolates the given numbers from these cases. 

Conclusion This may not be satisfactory, but there is no definite answer as intelligence is a complex topic. Wikipedia provides a good overview though: 

No. Most people claiming that there are no differences seem to cherry-pick the texts that they compare. And there are indeed texts which contain only few significant deviations, for example Isaiah. Although even they do contain some differences, such as replacing the word "foolish" from the Dead See Scrolls with the word "wise" in the Masoretic text in Isaiah 44:25 (see The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Developmental Composition of the Bible). There are also texts which contain more discrepancies, mainly found in Cave 4: 

Still, I think the estimate of the Chair of the UK Statistics Authority should provide an answer to your question. btw, this leaflet for staying in the EU puts the export percentage at 44%, using OSN data 

She follows this up with a list of her publications; none of which are both peer reviewed and about polar bears (it's either one or the other). The publications she lists which are related to polar bears are: 

And again, this seems to be it. She doesn't say which research she references, which cave paintings are meant, how she knows from these paintings which women where desirable, or how it has anything to do with todays women and their short hair and sex drive (evolutionary psychology is often criticized as a discipline itself, but Mutanda doesn't even try to make a reasonable connection here [if indeed she wanted to make the connection and not the Daily Star]). The Daily Star also asked a third person, Judy James, who is a "body language/behaviour [expert] with a high tv/radio profile". Here take: 

Numbers The numbers are not from one poll checking for bias or change in opinion based on who is president, but were selected by Maher from various polls to then draw that conclusion. While Maher names Pew as source, not all numbers are from Pew. Economy The source is this Pew poll: 

The JAR that expands on this statement and which was released by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI states: 

Studies finding higher variance among men There are studies that suggest that there is no difference in the mean, but that there is a greater variance among men. For example: 

The Daily Star claim and its proof There doesn't seem to be any evidence for the claim. It seems that the Daily Star went to three people who have some academic background, but whose focus is the media, and asked them their opinions on women, short hair, and sex. They found two that agree with their theory, and one that disagrees. The Daily Star article is not a reaction to research or new discoveries in any way or form. The original Daily Star article can be found here. The article isn't very in-depth, but it seems that the experts giving this theory "scientific backing" are Dr Pam Spurr and Anjula Mutanda. Spurrs company describes her as "an award-winning radio presenter, agony aunt, relationship, sex and behavior expert, and life coach". She does have a doctorate in psychology, but here focus isn't research but media. Her take on the topic is: 

During the CNN GOP Debate, Donald Trump gave two explanations for the repeated violent reactions of some of his supporters to protests at Trump rallies. The first one being love for their country and anger at the current state of it, the second being this: 

They do exist (the shop is here; they have two different models), but are likely not bought in huge numbers. Focus - a more or less reliable German news magazine - had an article about this in January 2017. They in turn name this WAZ article as source. The WAZ article does indeed mention that, according to the owner, the shop sold out of "Safe Shorts" - all 150 of them. The owner also claims that she already has requests for 250 more: 

Summarized, it says that one of the members of their Landtagsfraktion suggested Menuhin and he ended up on a provisional list without further examination (because of time constraints). That member then asked Menuhin if he would be willing to do the report, which Menuhin was not. The statement goes on saying that other members researched Menuhin in the meantime and found him to not be suitable. Conclusion According to statements made by the AfD itself, it seems to be true that Menuhin was asked by a party official if he was willing to do the assessment, but Menuhin was not. Afterwards, other party officials stated that Menuhin was never a serious candidate, and that they would not have accepted him for the position because of his Holocaust denialism. 

According to an article by The Independent, there are two sources for the funding of abstract expressionist art by the CIA: Donald Jameson - a CIA officer - and Tom Braden - former chief of the International Organizations division (IOD), which is 'the CIA office that "ran" the Congress for Cultural Freedom and Encounter magazine' (according to cia.gov). Jameson states that the purpose was to make socialist realism look bad. It should be noted that socialist realism should not be confused with social realism, which is what OP refers to. 

The whole list of adverse events and their percentage is listed under "AEs and discontinuation of injections". 4.7% were affected by altered mood, 2.8% by depressed mood or depression, 23.1% by pain at the injection site, and 38.1% by increased libido. Not all of these are definitely related to the birth control. The question already linked to the study showing a correlation between hormonal contraception and the use of antidepressant. According to the NIH, a side effect of female oral contraceptives can be depression or mood changes (uncommon). Here is a study that showed an increase, but there are also studies that show a decrease in depression with contraceptive use. Here is a review of studies that is inconclusive about a link. The linked Atlantic article names Liletta (an IUD) as example. According to the manufacturer, depression or depressed mood affect 5.4% of users, 5.2% are affected by mood changes. A review of studies showed that 22% of users of female contraceptives showed an increase in libido, and 15% showed a decrease. There may be contraceptives which increase libido more, and others which increase it less. Pain at the injection side is difficult to compare to the various contraceptive options offered to women. Conclusion It is true that the study of male birth control was canceled because of observed side effects, but a direct comparison of the severity of side effects of different birth controls is difficult. There is at least one female birth control product on the market that itself states adverse side effects that are comparable to those of the male birth control in question, at least regarding depression and mood changes. Regarding increased libido, a review of studies has shown that female birth control on average increases libido at half the rate of the male birth control. 

It shows that Republican numbers did significantly increase in 2017. It also shows that their numbers decreased significantly in 2009 (when Obama was elected). The numbers for Democrats are a bit more stable (although they also increased under Trump). Meaning It is difficult to draw any real conclusion based on these numbers. It is not too difficult to cherry-pick polls that would show that Democrats change their outlook based on the current president, while Republicans are much more stable (example). It is also difficult to say if the changes are based on who is president, or if other factors also affected the change. Here is an analysis of the issue (focused on Wisconsin), which concludes that both parties are affected by this, although Republicans more so. 

The specific program that is being cut is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative. Mulvaney's claim is a bit misleading, as providing food is not the primary purpose of CCLCs. The NYT fact-checked the claim and says (Links to their sources not included): 

It is clear that these aren't ideas Marx holds, but a rhetorical attribution of these ideas to Proudhon. In The Poverty of Philosophy Marx lays out the same argument, and here it is again very clear that this is an attribution of these ideas to Proudhon: 

This is true, see eg a statement by Res in the NY Daily News. She herself ends her statement with: "Donald Trump is not great for women and therefore not right for the United States". 

It is not true that it had to be proven that the child did not consent (children under 14 cannot consent to sex). It is true that the trial must be repeated because of a technicality. Specifically, the court should have determined that the perpetrator knew that the victim did not agree to the sexual actions. The court however did not establish the intent of the perpetrator, which is a procedural errors that results in a retrial. Here is a report about the case by the ORF: 

There are only a limited number of studies on this, with a limited sample size. None of them seem to check if children "changed their gender", but if they still match the criteria for GID. Here is one looking at 25 girls, only 15 of which actually met the criteria for GID. At follow-up, 3 met the criteria (12% of the 25 girls total, some of which did not meet the criteria at the beginning either): 

Eve having Sex with the serpent This is also called the serpent seed theory. The idea is that the arch angel Samael was the serpent and used that form to have sex with Eve, which then resulted in the birth of Cain. As for the reasoning for the claim, see for example this article by Howard Schwartz: 

It goes on citing the FDA analysis which reached the same conclusion. The papers conclusion is phrased a bit weaker though: 

Richard Lynns Research Richard Lynn is the editor of a journal that has been called white supremacist, and his work is often described as promoting scientific racism, so I would be a bit skeptical on what he has to say about the topic. His book "Race Differences in Intelligence" - which is used as a source here - has been criticized for using faulty data:
