Personally, I've found it useful to have just a footprint when backpacking or camping in mild climates to reduce the carrying weight. While just a rainfly and footprint won't keep bugs out, it will protect you from rain and wind, and will be much lighter without all of the tent fabric. With the potential for severe weather conditions, however I would bring a complete tent. 

I just bought my first pair of mountaineering boots. I know hiking boots need to be properly broken in before taking them on the trail, but what about plastic mountaineering boots? These are extremely stiff (from the plastic) in order to support crampons, and it doesn't seem like they would get easily molded during wear. 

Ive heard that climbing Kilimanjaro doesn't require any mountaineering skills and is really just a (very difficult) hike? Is that true? Is there any gear I would need besides traditional hiking equipment? 

Bowline knots are among the most commonly used knots across many different outdoor activities. It is used to create a fixed loop at the end of a line, while still being easy to tie and untie. How would I tie a bowline knot? 

Following Leave No Trace principles, which the previous party obviously didn't do, it would be better to camp in the new spot, and upon leaving, removing traces that you were there. We've personally replaced leaved that we had brushed aside to make space for tents to make it look like no camper had ever been there, in addition to carrying out all trash. 

Yes, and no, it kind of depends on the local laws. So long as your equipment is covered by your manufacturer guarantee, and you will have to bear in mind as will all diving the local laws and legislations for equipment use in various countries / regions within a country, then it can use a higher FO2 than diving with Air. However your equipment must be: 

However even they state that this is a general guideline and should not be taken as anything more than approximate! West Coast Surf - Source 

So this proves, for those of a keen eye, that there's inherently nothing special about the Robin Male vs Female, only the juveniles have a different colouring, no changes throughout the seasons like some mammals, nothing. They're pretty dapper in their red chests all year. SoWhyDoI 

Areas Include: East Wemyss, Crail, Kinghorn and St Monans UK Fossils have a good map where you can pick a location (eg, North Wales) and it will list all the areas where you can look for fossils, how common they are, and what period the fossils are from. 

Back on my childhood nostalgia train... After thinking about Crabbing I began to wonder if there are any particular sea life that I might have to be wary of when going rock pooling along the coastline? For this, please don't mention litter or various flotsam and jetsam type items, just sea life. Whilst I live in the UK I do travel abroad and love to rock pool throughout my travels so please mention what country you're posting about! For those unsure... Rock pooling is where you discover sea life, shells etc in the water left by low tide. 

When navigating in the backcountry, you'll usually bring a topographic map that shows the terrain so you can tell if there will be steep slopes or cliffs that might make the route difficult. A sample topographic map is: 

Sometimes when mountaineering, there may be an emergency situation which leaves you in bad weather with no or damaged shelter (such as returning from a summit attempt or after a wild and crazy storm). Snow shelters can keep you insulated as well as protect you from wind. How would you go about building one? 

I'm planning a whitewater rafting trip, and I'm worried what I should do if the raft flips over. Is there a standard set of procedures I should go through to get back on the raft? 

A stopper knot is often used to prevent rope from unexpectedly going throu some hole, such as a belay device. How would I tie a stopper knot? 

The different types of snowboards are: All-mountain: Versatile snowboards that can be used on all parts of the mountain, including machine-groomed runs, backcountry, and park and pipe. Freestyle: Boards that are light, short, and flexible, and ideal for terrain parks and doing tricks (riding rails, jibbing, etc) Freeride: Boards that are ideal for backcountry riding and going fast on groomed runs. Splitboards: Boards that can split in half for backcountry climbing. Powder: Boards that will spend most of their time in deep powder. They have wide waists, wide noses, and are generally rocker shaped to prevent the edges from catching. Sourced from REI. 

Blacks / Millets do festival pop up tents (take it out the bag and it literally pops up) and pole system tents in your price range by Eurohike and Vango, who are both good well known brands. Bear in mind for that price range I don't see you getting anything that will have brilliant reviews. You'll be able to buy them brand new so shouldn't have to worry about leaks / getting too wet. But remember it's a festival in the UK, the Gods of British Camping and Festivals will likely make it rain, and with all those people it will get muddy - but you can't blame the tent for that if it seeps through when you are only going to spend £50. Since you are only planning to throw it away after you might even go for the £20 on sale tents they have on offer. I wouldn't say at this price range you really need to worry about what to look for - especially since you are going to use and bin it. Blacks Festival Tents also @user3840692 also linked to Sports Direct which is where I get a lot of my Karrimor gear from. What my fiance an I usually look for in a tent (based on a mix of Car Camping and planning to future Wild Camp): 

I absolutely love bats and always have. In the UK we have eighteen species of bat. The Bat Conservation have a nice list for all the common UK species, including those which breed in the UK (which is 17 out of the 18 species, so we're doing quite well!). The above link also has a recording of the noise each bat makes, which should help you work out the species you have near you as Wales is home to 15 out of the 18 bat species. The Pipistrelle is the most common UK bat: 

If I am whitewater or sea kayaking, it is possible that my kayak will get overturned leading to a live or death situation. I've heard that it is possible to roll the kayak so it is right side up again, and that's it's called an Eskimo roll. How would I actually do that? 

There may be an emergency situation where I find myself needing to lower myself but with no or damaged equipment. Assuming I only have a rope, can I lower myself to safe ground? 

Since batteries (for cameras, cell phones, etc) will lose charge in cold weather, what can I do to prevent loss of charge, or at least extend the battery life as long as possible? 

If someone falls overboard from a sailboat, it is firstly imperative not to lose sight of the person since finding a man in water, especially when there's waves, can be very difficult. What techniques are there to direct the sailboat to rescue the man? 

In climbing, a double fisherman's knot is used to tie together two separate pieces of rope. How would I tie such a knot? 

The most common for rock climbing are with fingerboards or campus boards. Without those, you can perform dead hangs on anything you can hold onto, such as pullup bars. To make it a little more difficult, you can dead hang on the edges of doorways. There are other handheld devices for grip strengthening, such as tiger claws. Lastly, wrist curls with dumbbells will also strengthen forearms which will help when climbing. 

In the 80s and 90s, Ray Jardine popularized using sneakers on the PCT, which is very smooth and dry. However, hikers in the Adirondacks have to deal with rain nearly every day, deep mud, large numbers of rock crossings, and poorly maintained trails; a much larger proportion of them choose ankle-high boots. Most streams have bridges there, so one doesn't have to swap footwear very often. Finally, Scandanavia features a lot of bogs and swamps and is generally quite wet; relatively few streams have bridges. Knee-high rubber Wellington-style boots allow you to walk cross-country through mud and streams without changing footwear. 

Potentially, aiming at the neck is easier than aiming at the core, as necks tend to be vertical, and arrows drop in the vertical plane; this allows the archer to be slightly off on elevation and still produce a deadly shot. The downside is that they are extremely susceptible to deflections from branches and brush, and they rarely fit in normal quivers. 

You will need to determine the loading gauge of the railway carriages as well as the profile of the tunnel to see if any of these suggestions will work. Also, be aware that trains are often scheduled in groups, so once your first train passes, there may be more shortly thereafter. Again, this is an extremely bad idea. 

Several of the larger heads you see are designed to be shot at shorter distances at the turkey's neck, often from a ground blind. These allow the center point of the arrow to be off by 2", and, in theory, should either cut the turkey's head off, or miss entirely; a decapitated turkey will not go very far. 

Yes, this isn't an uncommon practice for tent manufacturers nowadays. They're normally family tents, big 6-8 man, but you can get some smaller 2 mans which are inflatable. It's generally for the ease of people car camping with kids, the quicker the tent goes up the better, or car camping in general as you need a pump usually. Some are in combination with the odd pole still, but there are plenty of manufacturers who do this such as: 

Having had horses myself, here in England, part of the reason you give way if you hear a horse coming on a Bridleway is because (and I say this having been in the situation) there is no speed limit for horses on Bridleways (some might have a trot sign but not always), if you're cantering or galloping along which you have every right to do it's harder for us to stop and wait than it is for people to step over. Horses at speed are dangerous to horse, rider and spectator. We giveway to bikers in my area for the same reason, they ring their bell, we move over. Same to joggers. My area in general seems to have an etiquette of slowest mover stops. I admit that is also incredibly rude to gallop past someone, but there is some historic value to that with UK hunts. Dog and Riders trump people and cars when any form of UK Hunt is being undergone. On roads, horses are inherently skittish, but not always. Anything from a plastic bag to a lorry's air brake may but not necessarily will set a horse off, which is why in the UK horses on the road trump cars, cars must slow down and pass slowly, emergency vehicles turn off sirens etc. I once even had armed forces slow their march for us as we rode through their land. Regardless, in the UK as well the rider must make themselves clearly known - high vis is required to walk on our roads, and in general this means you should on a bridleway as well. Part of hacking etiquette around where I am from. In some locations where walkers are common you might also need a license to hack, I've had this in public woodland. In my experience as both horse rider and hiker, it's best for the hiker to step over and wait, and for the rider, whether of horse or of bike, to slow down (if possible) and say thank you ... you will be surprised how many people don't. For the most part around Buckinghamshire, simply being a walker / biker / outdoors person will put you in a sort of polite and thankful outdoors social circle. Many walkers, and various riders, will say 'Good morning / Afternoon' or 'Hello' to you as you pass, and for the most part they remember to say 'Thank you' as well. 

As others have mentioned, the best exercise you can get is simply hiking. To train for weight, it's recommended to fill the backpack with water or sand that can be thrown out at the top to prevent knee injuries. If you live in the flatlands like I do, there's not much elevation changes. The closest in the gym is to use an incline treadmill or a stepmill. I've even filled up a bag with weights to use on the stepmill. As for specific weightlifting exercises, hiking requires a lot of lower body strength and endurance. Various squats and deadlifts can help strengthen your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and back. General cardio (running, biking, or swimming) is always helpful since it'll build endurance, and if you can shave some pounds off your body, that's less weight you have to carry. Alpine Ascents has a training program to prepare for Denali, which, while a little bit overboard for hiking, still shares the same concepts. Body Results also has provides some mountaineering training DVDs which also share similar concepts. 

Avalanches are extremely dangerous when mountaineering, winter backpacking/camping, or backcountry skiing/snowboarding. What causes them and is there any way I can predict when an avalanche is about to occur? 

I'm planning a whitewater rafting trip, and I keep reading that different rapids are different classes, and sometimes the same rapid is different classes at different times of the year? What do the classes mean, and is there a level that would be too dangerous to raft? 

Without going too in depth into marketing... stores are very likely to sell what they know a consumer is likely to buy, and in numbers. If you'll note snow shovels and sledges turn up in UK stores in winter and certainly in the South they are plastic, and not likely to be used (or last if they are!). They will sell well when people are going to panic buy and therefore the quality can be low due to an unlikeliness to sell but not many people will panic buy snow shoes. The stores we have would prefer to cater to weather they can guarantee we will have... rain is more common all year round - you're more likely to find waders than snow shoes in our stores. Ideally if you want something that companies like Blacks, Millets (acutally owned by Blacks), Sports Direct, Go Outdoors, Trespass etc might consider specialised, you're better off buying online as they might not keep the items in stock, as here I would say they would very likely come under seasonal stock. As a note Blacks (and others) have 'Snow Boots' but they certainly look more fashionable than servicable, being more like very winter wellies... So lack of continuous snow and availability would be why people are less likely to use them. MET Office UK Snow 

Urban red foxes have been known to be a tad vicious or territorial and attack people... but it is not a common occurrence by any means, usually it's due to the fox having gotten itself into a cornered situation, they then act as any wild animal will and potentially strike. There is always the odd news story of a fox getting into a house, and attacking people... but it's uncommon, and for the majority of interactions, the fox only strikes as it cannot escape. The majority of them are simply made up by people who have had vague experiences... Not all pet dogs attack, but once bitten twice shy. Rabid foxes are also, like urban foxes, less wary of humans than their rural counterparts. Also an injured fox may attempt to bite you if you get too close, but this is common of any wild animal that has an injury. That said, I've never had a bad experience with either an urban or rural red fox. Usually they just run away from you. I've seen some beautiful red foxes in my town, and out in the woods, they look at you, they may watch a while, but they don't come close, or let you get close. Red foxes are not massive pack animals, but they will hunt with their cubs, to teach them until they move on on their own. They for the most part hunt small rodents, nothing bigger than a rabbit. Foxes are known to scavenge in bins, eat nuts and berries... they're opportunistic. You will more likely see a fox at dusk, or at night, but they do not attack people so there is no worry about exploring an area either at day or night. That said you should always be respectful of whenever you are exploring, and be aware that your torchlight could easily disturb, or spook, a number of nocturnal animals. Just a note when we have our dog around we actually have noticed the red foxes will linger longer... we recently had a fox run right into a field maybe 5 meters from us, stop dead and stare at the dog, then run off after a few seconds. Taking a dog exploring with you at night in a foxes habitat is something I would say you need to be aware of - but again the fox will likely just run.
