To start with, of course its possible. Given that you are are college hire, I am guessing you haven't had a lot of control in choosing the appropriate date. Nevertheless, a heads up would have been nicer. But still, good companies don't penalize on such matters. Unless your position needs to be filled very urgently, there's good chance they will allow. 

First off, almost any company can make a few exceptional offers that aren't the norm. May be your colleague is one such. Another factor could be that over the past few years your company has focused more on higher renumeration to new employees. Who is to tell that other new hires (freshers or experienced) aren't earning way more than you too. Third 

I would say there's nothing at stake here process wise, where you trying to contact the interviewer can potentially cause a conflict of interest. They have already decided not to pursue further with your hiring process. So any help that you may need might as well be gladly extended by the interviewer or not, which is at her own discretion entirely. I would recommend going ahead with your plan. 

I don't see any reason, given the settings, as to why there would be a situation building up. Your manager probably thought, and rightly so, that one party would be cheaper than a new hire party and a farewell party at separate times. Only reason i think this can potentially be tricky if the new hire is a replacement for the older employee, and the employee was made to leave on some account. In which case, you can't do much to help ease the tension except by promoting alcohol and drag them to the dance floor. 

Are they capable and need to be trained? If so, train them yourself or get resources to have them trained. Are they unable for some other reason? If so, have mercy on them and find them another position inside or outside of the company. Are they unwilling? Fire them without mercy 

Older people are not always better, but more experienced people can see patterns in development and business that transcend merely the newest techniques / programming language / algorithm / trends. Don't worry about your age. If you really have more value than your potential employer offers you, make your case. If they do believe you, you'd better live up to what you represented. If they don't believe you, go seek out another offer and work at a different place. If you can't find another job, maybe you're not worth what you thought you were worth. 

Non-Profits / NGO's / Government Be aware that some organizations hire based upon your social attitudes. Typically these are not commercial companies. So, if you're headed in this direction, you need to ensure that you communicate the social value of what you learned while on travel and how it relates to the employer. For example, you traveled to India and learned how citizens interact with their government. This might position you well for an NGO that was interested in political movements. Commercial Entities What is the commercial value of your travel? "Worldliness" from travel experience does not necessarily translate into commercial success. However, meeting people, sharing experiences, finding innovate ways to eat / transport yourself / organize people may translate into sales, marketing, business development, or technical sales support in foreign nations. Did you learn a language? Develop a specific cultural sensitivity to an ethnicity or religion that could be valuable for a commercial entity. Focus on the Value Focus on the specific value that your travel offers. If it does not offer any, don't try to inflate it. You'd be better off soul searching as to what it offers than creating something feeble on your resume. 

I will be having an interview with HR after the technical interview. Basically what kind of valid questions should I want to ask from them? 

I have noticed that many of our analysts and techs can be disruptive in meetings. When someone is talking, the tech may interrupt that person, speaking loudly. Even though they are speaking about the topic at hand, I feel that it's not polite. I'm junior in my workplace, but I am bothered by this. I might feel the need to deal with it soon. How should I let them know my feelings? 

I had an interview for Software Engineer. I answered the interview questions well and that person was impressed with the way i have answered. Now almost a week after the interview and i haven't got any call from them. Should i call back and ask whether i got selected or not ? Or wait until they call me ? 

US dollar is changing very fast in my country now. I'm working for a foreign company and I get a very satisfactory salary. But my consideration is as the US dollar is fluctuating rapidly, should I drop a email to HR division to point this out? Foreign company might be paying for the employees by US dollars. But our salaries have defined(by the company in my country) in local currency. Therefore, even though the US dollar raised up, employee salary doesn't raise up . Many of my expenses are online ones. Therefore I face this impact hugely. Is this something point out to HR division as a normal employee like me? 

Recently a U.S. employer told us not to skate(board) between buildings because they were liable for us. Is this true? The buildings were leased by the employer from a single landlord. The space between the two buildings (e.g. parking lot, sidewalk, ...) is owned by the landlord. When you walk on the landlord's property between two workplaces is the employer really liable? I thought this kind of liability was all state-by-state and covered by Worker's Compensation, not the liability of the employer... 

Know compensation for similar positions. Use salary surveys, private information, ... whatever you can get your hands on. Pay attention to regional differences throughout the U.S. Also keep in mind sectors are different (healthcare, semiconductor, ...) Estimate what you are worth to your potential employer. If you expect to make $100,000 then bear in mind that the employer is spending $130k - $200k in salary and benefits (sometimes more). In addition, the first 6 - 12 mos. a new employee is not really at 100% efficiency. So, investing in a new employee is expensive regardless of your expertise. Understand how money flows in the company from customers to you. Can you really produce $200k of revenue each year? Are you going to produce (by virtue of your work and your subordinates' work) more than $200k per year. If so, how are you going to do that? Never use 'he or she got that, so I should too'. No employer I know is going to listen to that. You just sound like a little kid complaining. I don't want to hire a complainer. It is not negotiating if you can't walk away. If you think that you must take whatever offer you're provided, you can't negotiate. Unless you can walk away and say 'no thanks', you're not really negotiating. Be reasonable. I already lived through (x1) Dot.com boom / bust. Friends were getting (x2) the 'standard' consulting rate to take ridiculous work. Be ethical and reasonable and you'll get respect - that is worth a lot more than an extra $100/week. Give something to get something. Offer to take on specific job functions, management, documentation, training of others - offer something your employer values to get something you value. Don't negotiate for future raises. It never happened for me - all the promises of promotions or salary adjustments or bonuses never materialized. Negotiate for the here and now, not some promise of a 'review in six months'. Use the job as a learning experience for the next negotiation. If you don't think you can truly negotiate for more money or if you don't get what you've asked, decide if the organization can 'teach' you something intangible. Face it. If you're asking StackExchange for advice, you may lack the experience to negotiate strongly. Look at the advice you've been given and try to figure out in your existing job or in this new opportunity what you learn to negotiate better the next time. 

Today I received my confirmation letter in my workplace as a Software Developer after completing my probation. I applied to the advertisement which was looking for an Associate Software Engineer.(Software Developer < Associate Software Engineer) And I got recruited.This is my current workplace. Designation is something important when looking for future career opportunities. I haven't completed my college degree yet. But this is also not my first job either. So when I joined the company, they didn't talk anything about my designation.(They were aware that when I join the company that I haven't completed my college studies) I thought when I get confirm, they may change the designation to Associate Software Engineer.But this has not happened. Will it be a wise action to talk this with the HR manager? (I still don't have the degree) 

You have IoT to do! You got a great opportunity. Don't miss it. Most of the time everyone will spend some period like this in their early stages of when they come to professional industry. Basically this is something usual for many of us. Learn about some area which is in your field. You can plan like weekly. This week I'm going to learn about Node.js/concurrency in Java/ linux bash scripting/ etc. Don't think that your boss is just paying for you to be 8 hours inside the office. He/She might intended you to grab some knowledge during this time period.
