I never use a person as a reference who wouldn't give me a stellar review. And I always talk to my potential references ahead of time, tell them what I am doing, where I have interviewed, and ask if they would be a reference for me. And if there is any question in my mind at all, I always ask "Would you say good things about me?" I seldom have to ask that question, but I'd never want to lose a great job due to a weak reference. And I never want to put people on the spot if they would prefer not to be a reference for me. I would almost never use my current boss as a reference, since I'd seldom want my current company to know I was planning to leave. Most potential employers will allow you to get by without a current reference, if you have sufficient prior references. If absolutely necessary, I use a trusted colleague aside from the boss at the current company. 

Something like this: "I understand that you'd like me to start as soon as possible and I would too. However I feel that I'm professionally bound to honor the two week notice period that my current company is requesting and leave them in as good shape as possible. I'm sure you'll agree that this is only fair." 

There's no need to say anything substantive nor is there a need to lie. Simply saying that you are leaving for "better opportunities" is virtually always true. Remember, you don't owe your current employer any explanations, and you certainly aren't required to talk about the details of your new company, job or salary. Since you will have already accepted the new position, I'll assume you don't want to get into a negotiation about staying with your current employer. Thus, there's no benefit to you to reveal any details about the new job. Just be thankful for the opportunity you got in your present job, give an appropriate notice period, be professional during your transition out and end things on good terms. 

You should ask before the interview, typically when you are settling on a time, date, and location. Just ask "This interview is going to involve some travel, lodging, and food expense on my part. What is your policy on reimbursing interview expenses?" Then pay attention to the response. Make sure you know what the company will and won't pay for, and what you are expected to do in order to be reimbursed. Some companies have special lodging arrangements, and will want you to stay in particular hotels, for example. You want to make sure you can follow their rules precisely. it won't look good for you if you submit for expenses that they didn't tell you could be reimbursed. It might make you look as if you can't follow instructions, and may diminish your candidacy. If you neglected to establish what their reimbursement rules while planning your interview, the best you can do now is try and ask now - before the expenses occur, and certainly before the interview. It's unfortunate, but the best you can do. 

From your point of view, there's nothing wrong looking for another job. But certainly you can understand the company's point of view that "they wanted people who were 100% focused on the product and on the company." Managers want to assign projects to folks and expect them to be around to complete them. It also tends not to be great for the morale of others in the group when one member declares that they are leaving soon. While you were probably still doing your best, experience tells us that it's hard to continue to do your best while your heart is set on getting out. People in your situation tend to lose their focus. 

The entire senior management team (the boss, you and the other person) should meet immediately to discuss your financial situation - including how you handle questions. If I were in charge, I'd hold an all-hands meeting to honestly discuss the state of the company and the company finances. I'd talk about where we are financially, what we have had to do so far, and what we plan to do for the foreseeable future. I would take questions, and answer honestly, including answering "I don't know" where appropriate. I'd apologize for not informing everyone sooner, and for the sloppy handling of the electrical bill. In such a small company, everyone should feel part of the solution. Thus, everyone needs to understand what is really going on, so they can make the proper decisions. 

Some shops are very aggressive with their proxy servers, using it to ban everything they deem "not work". If they spend enough time with it, they can reasonably effectively lock down their employees' computers. It's not perfect, but it can send a powerful message to employees: we are watching, and we don't want you to ever do anything on our computers that isn't work. The downside is the demonstrated lack of trust, the vigilance required to block enough sites, and the need to have procedures in place to unblock sites when a legitimate site is inappropriately blocked. And it's a slippery slope. If they ban Facebook, they probably should ban LinkedIn, Twitter, and even Stackexchange. The list of potential "not work" sites is enormous. My current company takes this approach. They block a wide swath of sites to the extent that even personal mail (such a Gmail) is blocked. At one point, they had blocked a subset of Google - making it impossible for some of the technical folks to do research that was part of their job. It was a pain to get approval to remove that block. Over time, people have figured out how to get around the block, such as using their own devices (phones, etc) to use any social media site they prefer. But other companies rely on a different approach. Rather than make an ever-growing list of which sites are blocked, they allow the employee to use the computer in any way they decide, but hold them accountable to get their work done. I strongly favor the latter approach, particularly for knowledge workers. This was the approach my company used to take, before we were acquired by a much larger, more bureaucratic company. My sense is that as a Manager, I don't want to be telling individuals what they should and shouldn't be doing every minute of every day. That's micromanagement, and it doesn't scale. Instead, I want to set the bar for what I need them to do, and when I need it done. I help set the expectations, give them the tools and framework to be successful, then I look at their output, rather than what they did along the way. I like to treat people as adults, as professionals, to expect good things, and reward achievement. Those who cannot control themselves and abuse this trust get poor reviews, and get fired if they don't subsequently improve. An "appropriate usage" policy, a little bit of training, and some common sense seemed to work well for our smaller company, without the heavy-handed approach that the current larger company prefers. 

Since you are on good terms with the manager in question, you should talk with him/her first. You could say something like "When you meet at your desk like that, I can't help but overhear. In particular, when you talked about the migration to Git, I had some information that could help. Would you like me to jump in and join the conversation in those cases?" The manager might then choose to invite you to the meetings, or invite you whenever your opinion is needed, or move the meetings to somewhere else so as to not disturb you. Let your future actions be guided by this discussion.
