If $f\in DC$ and $f(a)=0$ then $f(x)=(x-a)g(x)$ with $g\in DC$. The proof is based on the formula $$g(x)=\int_0^1f'(tx)dt.$$ By induction, this gives $f(x)=(x-a)^mg(x)$, for every $f\in DC$ and every $a$, with some non-negative integer $m$ and $g\in DC$, $g(a)\neq 0$. If $f\in DC$ and $F$ is analytic on the range of $f$, then $F\circ f\in DC$. This follows from the great theorem of E. M. Dyn'kin (J.d'Analyse 60 (1993)) that characterizes $DC$ in terms of pseudoanalytic extension to a complex semi-neighborhood of a real interval. 

First of all, this question must be decided by the adviser, not by the student. The student must accept any decision if his/her adviser. Most advisers that I know (mathematicians) will not co-author a paper with a student, if the contribution of a student is substantial. But this depends on a person of course, in particular on the adviser's own experience when s/he was a student. For example, the first paper of Ahlfors was not written by himself (though the main idea was his). As a result, Ahlfors established a rule to never co-author his PhD student paper. (He mentions this is his comments to his first paper in his Collected papers). Myself, I try to follow this rule, but exceptions are possible. 

are checked out from my university library. Mathscinet shows 1157 citations for the last 2 editions. Another question is old papers which are still highly sited. A typical life span of a paper is much smaller than that of a book. In the list of 100 most cited papers in 2011, I found only two papers published before 1950 (One by Shannon and another by Leray). 

Let me rephrase your question: is every pair of commuting functions simultaneously conjugate to a pair shifts? (Your conditions, literally understood imply that your $h$ is a bijective map.) The answer is evidently no. In your example, $ax$ and $bx$ are restricted to the positive ray. If you consider the "same" functions on the whole real line, they are already not conjugate to shifts. Because they have a fixed point while the shifts do not. One can replace conjugacy by semiconjugacy, requiring in your notation $h(F)=f(h)$, and $h(G)=g(h)$ (without the requirement that $h$ is invertible) but even in this case, not every pair of commuting functions is semiconjugate to an affine pair. Commuting rational functions are almost completely classified in the paper of J. F. Ritt, TAMS 1923, and another proof of the same result can be found in my paper MR1027462. Only for polynomials (and some subclasses of rational functions, like Blaschke products) the problem of description of all commuting pairs is completely solved. There is an enormous literature about this and other classes of commuting functions and maps. Under some additonal conditions, like having a common fixed point, commuting pairs are frequently (not always) semiconjugate to pairs of linear maps. 

This is not true. To construct an example, consider an auxilliary function $\phi$ whose Fourier transform is supported by $(-1,1)$, and such that $\phi(x)=O(|x|^{-N}),\; x\to\pm\infty$ for all $N>0$. To construct such a function, take an inverse Fourier transform of an infinitely smooth function supported on $(-1,1)$. Notice that $\phi$ is entire, of exponential type, by the Wiener-Paley theorem. Now find a polynomial $P_\epsilon$ such that $|P_\epsilon(x)\phi(x)|<\epsilon$ for $|x|<1$, but $\int_{-2}^2| P_\epsilon(x)\phi(x)|^2dx\geq 1 $. It is clear that such a polynomial exists for every $\epsilon$ (by Runge's theorem, or by Weierstrass theorem, or just write it explicitly). So the function $P\phi$ violates your inequality. But it is in $L^2(R)$ and and also it entire of the same exponential type as $\phi$, so its Fourier transform is still supported on $(-1,1)$ by Wiener-Paley. To make your statement true, you have to restrict $\|\hat{f}\|_2$. Then your class of functions will be a normal family, and you will have your inequality with $C=C(\|\hat{f}\|_2)$. 

Stability. I interpret this in a very general sense. If A implies B, does a small perturbation of A implies a small perturbation of B? This "theme" is omnipresent. I omit the discussion of the classical notion of Lyapunov's stability... And I give only two examples, as required. I. A dynamical system is called "structurally stable" or "robust", if a small perturbation of dynamics (in an appropriate function space) leads to the "same behavior", for example the preturbed system is topologically conjugate to the unperturbed one. See, for example, MR0925417 Andronov, A. A.; Vitt, A. A.; Khaĭkin, S. È. Theory of oscillators, Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1987. For a more recent example of the same, see MR0732343 Mañé, R.; Sad, P.; Sullivan, D. On the dynamics of rational maps, Ann. Sci. École Norm. Sup. (4) 16 (1983), no. 2, 193–217. II. Liouville's theorem says that conformal maps in Euclidean spaces of dimension $n\geq 3$ are "trivial", that is they are restrictions of M\"obius transformations. What if a map is "close to conformal"? There is a nice precise definition of this: quasiconformal with small dilatation. See the wonderful book of Reshetnyak, MR1326375 Reshetnyak, Yu. G. Stability theorems in geometry and analysis, Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, 1994. III. An example of unsolved problem (due to Fedya Nazarov). A classical theorem of Rado says that if $f$ is a continuous function in a region in the complex plane, and $f$ is analytic on the set $\{ z:f(z)\neq 0\}$ then $f$ is analytic everywhere. What if $f$ is known to be analytic on the set $\{ z:|f(z)|>\epsilon\}$. Is it globally close to an analytic function in some sense? Give a quantitative estimate in terms of $\epsilon$. Everyone can add her favorite examples of stability. 

According to the Jahrbuch database, the first edition was in 1915. Moreover, this 1915 edition was an extended version of a 1902 book, by Whittaker alone. The last revision was in 1927. The book is still in print, and widely used, not only by mathematicians but by physicists and engineers. Soon we will celebrate the centenary... It has 1056 citations on Mathscinet, by the way, and 8866 on the Google Scholar ! Perhaps this deserves a Guinnes book of records entry as a "textbook longest continuously in print". And I suppose this is a record not only for math but for all sciences... with the exception of Euclid and Ptolemy, of course:-) If we include not only textbooks but research monographs there are plenty of other examples, even older ones: 

The answer to your question is "no" in a very strong sense: I will construct $a$ such that $a(x,0)\neq 0$ and $$\int_0^1e^{\lambda x}a(x,1/\lambda)dx\equiv 0.$$ Begin with $a(x)$ infinitely smooth, not identically $0$, supported by $[0,1]$. Set $$F(\lambda,t)=(1-\lambda t)\int_0^1e^{\lambda x}a(x)dx,$$ where $t\geq 1$ is a parameter. This is an entire function of exponential type with indicator diagram $[0,1]$, it decreases in both imaginary directions faster than any negative power of $|\lambda|$, and has a zero at the point $1/t$. Now consider its Laplace transform: $$f(z,t)=\int_0^\infty e^{-\lambda z}F(\lambda,t)d\lambda,$$ where the integral is over a ray. This function $f$ is analytic in $C\backslash[0,1]$, zero at infinity. One can easily see that the boundary values from above and from below on $[0,1]$ make two smooth functions. Then let $a(x,t)$ be the difference of these two boundary functions, divided by $2\pi i$. Then we have $$F(\lambda,t)=\int e^{x\lambda}a(x,t)dt,$$ by the Laplace (Borel) inversion formula, and $F(\lambda,1/\lambda)\equiv 0$. The reference for Laplace and Borel transforms is the book of Levin, Distribution of roots of entire function. And please tell me, what do you call "Weierstrass theorem"? 

Q1. There are two DIFFERENT notions of Riemann surface in the literature. a) One-dimensional complex analytic manifold (coming from the book of Weyl). b) Riemann surface "spread over the plane (or over the Riemann sphere)". Your second definition, the set of germs with an appropriate topology on it, formalizes this second notion. Older books seem to understand Riemann surfaces in the sense of the second definition. Sometimes a) was called an "abstract Riemann surface" in these books. For most mathematicians with modern training the "Riemann surface of log z" and the "Riemann surface of arccos z" are meaningless expressions because these are the same as the plane, in the sense of definition a). The formal relation between a) and b) is the following. "A Riemann surface spread over the plane" is a pair (S,f), where S is an abstract Riemann surface and f is a holomorphic function from S to C. (If f is meromorphic, we have a Riemann surface spread over the sphere.) Here is another way to say this. Let S be a Riemann surface in the sense a). It has a set of charts $\phi_j: U_j\to D_j$ from the elements of an open covering U to discs D in the plane. The correspoddence maps $\phi_k\circ\phi_j^{-1}$ on $D_j\cap D_k$ must be conformal. Now let us require that these correspondence maps be IDENTITY maps of $D_j\cap D_k$. Then we obtain notion b). This is an additional structure on a Riemann surface in the sense a) which is sometimes called a flat structure. If you look carefully (say, on the example of arccos) you will see that the two definitions of a Riemann surface in the sense b) that I gave are not exactly equivalent. More about this in my survey "Geometric theory of meromorphic functions", and in the preprint of Biswas and Perez Marco, Log Riemann Surfaces. 

I suppose that if you want a second PhD in Math you have to hide the fact that you already have one. But I do not recommend you to do this. What will you do with your existing publications ? In my university at least, it is a policy not to accept to the PhD program those who already have a PhD. (I don't know whether this policy is written or unwritten. And how strict it is. Probably they do not ask explicitly. And I know people who actually had a PhD (in another country) and who were accepted to our PhD program. They did not mention in their CV that they had a PhD. It is probably true that most people employed by the "second-tier" math departments are from "top" universities. But it is not true that the hiring committees do not consider other applications. I know many people in "top" universities who have PhD from little-known places. 

As it was noted by Ryan Budney and Lee Mosher and Ben Braun, the word "consistent" cannot be used here in the sense of modern mathematical logic. So one cannot investigate this question rigorously. But one can apply the word "consistent" with its everyday (fuzzy) sense, meaning "free of contradictions". Then the answer is to some extent a question of opinion. Myself I side with the opinion of Peter Vickers: early calculus was consistent. It was not worse than arguments in most other hard sciences (physics, chemistry). But perhaps not on the level of rigor of Mathematics. On the other hand, what Berkeley says "a most inconsistent way of arguing, and such as would not be allowed in Divinity" sounds ridiculous to me. "Divinity" is a pseudo-science which deals with the things that do not exist; thus what is "allowed" in Divinity or not allowed is completely a matter of opinion. Divinity cannot be compared with other hard sciences, while mathematics of Newton (or Leibnitz or Euler) can. 

The exercise is stated in Dym and McKean with a mistake. The correct statement is If $f$ is real, even, the finite limits $f(x\pm 0)$ exist for all $x$, and $\hat{f}$ does not change sign for $|x|>A$, then $f$ is continuous at all points. The statement is in the paper of M. Kac (1938) to which Dym and McKean refer. The proof is simple: inverse Fourier transform of positive function is continuous. If $\hat{f}$ is positive only for $|x|>A$, add to it the function $h(x)=B,\; |x|<A$ and $h(x)=0$ otherwise, to make it positive everywhere. The inverse Fourier transform of $h$ is explicitly computed and it is continuous. Remark. The assumptions can be relaxed by saying that $f$ is real even integrable and bounded in a neighborhood of $0$. 

This seems to be in the same spirit, but more accessible than what you asked. Because we know quite a lot about elementary functions but really nothing about elementary numbers. For this question, perhaps it is possible to prove rigorously prove that the answer is no, with Liouville-Ritt elementary functions. But so far I was unable to prove that $W_j$ is non-elementary as a function of, say $a_1$, when $n\geq 3$. (When $n\leq 3$ it is elementary, and it was known that the mean motion has an elementary expression when $n\leq 3$ (Bohl). With "purely real elementary functions", in the spirit of your definition, the answer is still no, if we allow the $\arcsin{}$ in your definition to have the domain $(-1,1)$. Then all elementary functions are analytic (as compositions of analytic functions), but we have a non-analytic limit: ($x\to+\infty$ along the positive ray) $$\lim_{x\to+\infty}\arctan(ax)=\frac{\pi}{2}{\mathrm{sgn}}(a),\quad \lim_{x\to+\infty}(1+a^x)^{1/x}.$$ If you allow $\arcsin$ on $[-1,1]$ then elementary functions can be discontinuous like $\arcsin(\sin x)$, and the above counterexample does not work. If you remove trigonometric functions from your class, the answer is yes. And this was essentially proved by Hardy in his book Orders of Infinity. 

You may expand at every point, singular or non-singular. At a non-singular point you will obtain 2 series with integer powers, with radius of convergence at least the distance to the closest singular point. At a regular singular point you obtain two series with radius of convergence at least the distance to the other singular points. You can do it for every singular (and non-singular) point, and obtain many series, each representing solutions in its own disk. These discs overlap, of course. The problem how Frobenius solutions on two different overlapping disks are related is a difficult problem which is called the "connection problem". In which point you "should" expand depends on the purpose of your expansion. The standard reference is E. L. Ince, Ordinary differential equations. 

Almost everything in mathematics, indeed, can be "hyperbolic", "parabolic" or "elliptic". Like PDE's, Riemann surfaces, or manifolds of higher dimension, fractional-linear transformations, fixed points of a map, etc. Not even mentioning the 3 kinds of the conic sections:-) Of course this can be traced back to the fundamental trichotomy "positive", "zero" and "negative". In differential geometry we have three great areas: "positive curvature", "negative curvature" and "zero curvature". See also: 

Your intuition is right: you only have to check the line segments through vertices. (Proof: the distance from a fixed point to a moving point on a line is a convex function of this moving point). This is also true for line segments passing through any other fixed point inside, it does not have to be the centroid. In general, this cannot be improved, unless you have some additional information about your polygon. 

I have no proposal, but only want to mention a historical example of what can be called "Citizen science" in mathematics. $URL$ This is how the book of Abramowitz and Stegun, Handbook of Mathematical Functions was created. During the Great Depression, the National Bureau of Standards hired jobless people (not professional mathematicians) to compute tables of special functions. The result was a good and useful book. Perhaps nobody is using tables nowadays but the book is still useful. Suppose that the 4-color was checked by 1000 amateurs instead of a computer. Would the proof be more reliable, or more convincing? In astronomy, there is a whole area which is mostly done as "Citizen's Science". It is the discovery of new comets. Only amateurs can afford just to look at random places in the sky. However, with improvement of computers speed and software, I predict that even this will be soon "automatized". And one more question: it is somehow taken for granted that "citizen's science" is something desirable, so this part of the question is not even discussed. (I am not so sure). 

The answer is "yes". We have $$f(x)=\int_{-\omega}^\omega g(t)e^{2\pi itx}dt,$$ so $$|f'(x)|^2\leq\left(2\pi\int_{-\omega}^\omega |t||g(t)|dt\right)^2\leq\frac{8\pi^2\omega^3}{3}\| g\|_2,$$ by Cauchy-Bounyakovski-Schwarz inequality. It remains to notice that $\| g\|_2=\| f\|_2$ according to Parseval . Equality when $g(t)=t$.
