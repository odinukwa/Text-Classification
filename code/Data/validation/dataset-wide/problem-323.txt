You don't need to win the presidency to have political impact. Trying to change the voting system on the Federal level is a relatively hard problem because it requires you to convince a lot of different people. if you wanted to fight the two party system it makes much more sense to focus on a more local level. Getting a single US state to switch to Party List Proportional Representation for it's state election would be much easier than to try to get the whole US to change. 

China's one-child policy didn't result in a different demographic development than a country like Thailand without such a policy. As a result it wouldn't be the policy to focus on. Current trends mean that many developed countries achieve a children/woman ratio substantially lower than 2. That means over the long-term the population would shrink. A population engineer would therefore do whatever they can to repeat to develop other countries as well. Reducing childhood deaths is especially important. Which trends could still produce long-term population growth? Growing religions such as the Mormons demand it's adherents to have many children. Taking actions to deconvert those groups and let them shrink instead of grow over time could be another area for policies. 

Information in the brain could be stored on DNA short-term and reloaded upon shifting to larger brain sizes. You don't use most of you brain so vast parts of it it wouldn't need to be stored. Of course even without compression you can store the entire capacity of the human brain on 66,667 DNA strands. For comparison there's 100,000 neurons in a fruit fly's brain according to Wikipedia. 

So to summarize if you had a decent enough repair man and a source of electricity to make oil (abandoned plant, wood powered steam engine, hand cranked alternator) you could keep a car running for a pretty long time in such a scenario and if you got a hold of certain parts probably pretty close to indefinitely. (I'm thinking zero wear plastics, ceramics, or super-alloys like you might find in racing or experimental parts but used at <40 mph on a regular car). It however would definitely be hard as you would need to find the solution to each issue rather quickly to prevent the issues from being "insurmountable". If nobody paid attention to the issues it would be pretty easy, as others noted in their answers, to run all the viable autos into the ground. 

If you would have a political tests on the powers of the president it might have a question like: Constiutionally declaring war is the prerogative of congress but in practice US presidents do have the power to start war. A person creating the test could decide on what happens to be the right answer based on their own political beliefs. That means they can filter who's allowed to vote based on the political beliefs of the person. You can't have a test without a person writting the test. Thinking of the test being unbaised is like thinking of Supreme Court Justices being unbaised. The human element is always present and can't be simply removed. 

There are many reports of tribes considering photography to be dangerous because it supposedly steals a persons soul. You can make a decent argument that those tribes consider photography to be magical. Even among people born in the West you find many people who consider Derren Brown to have real magic powers and aren't willing to believe that he's just using a bunch of tricks. 

In conclusion, I'm not an expert but after a fair amount of research it seems like you could just wing it and you'd be good. Disruptions in the clouds are still being explained (magnetism, etc.) so as long as you explosions are roughly uniformly distributed (or so densely packed we missed it), your probably good to go. 

You could dabble in the middle of the two extremes but if you live long enough even the dumbest person will learn everything just from walking through the universe. So now the question becomes what does a near-omniscient near-immortal being do to pass the time? Once again you either push the boundaries or play the odds. But go far enough and maybe you hit the wall and know how things will play out. What do you do when you've done everything and know all the certainties? You watch the racehorses and dare each other to jump off the skyscraper. There has to be a limitation of your abilities. If there is you'll let chance wiggle into that niche and make a game to amuse yourself, only the unknown will be novel at that point, or maybe you'll fade from existence after having your gazillion-th burger. Maybe you seal some of your ability or bet with it? At some point you can roll the dice and not know the outcome. Maybe there is no limitations, or maybe you just prefer the alternative? How about a battle of wits? Maybe with the low-techs as the RNG? But when gods wage war its bound to be bad for the universe. Either way things like humans end up looking like Honeybees. Social, maybe a source of enjoyment, maybe a source of displeasure or pain, maybe even necessary for the fabric of life as we know it, but ultimately insignificant. So what about that other way around? How do the cave peoples interact with the aliens? Why would the HPLD culture allow them to? If they already are having a hard time of it maybe they aren't talking out of goodwill. Why hasten our demise? If you become a god and can resurrect the dead then wouldn't it eventually happen? Wouldn't it look like Walt Disney never died, when to them he was only dead for a tiny fraction of the time of his immortality? If nothing is of consequence then why hasten anything at all? Whimsical, lazy, or mocking views on our fate seem like the most likely outcomes for how the culture would view any low-tech culture. If they're not being neutral out of the kindness of their hearts or because they don't care, then their doing it out of some vindictive spite. Of course if they killed everyone they might save them from the endless boredom of immortality. Of course this is at the top of the power spectrum. As you start to come back down things can get interesting again. Like your Babylon-5 and Dancers at the End of Time examples. If the culture isn't dead then you have time to develop a culture around doing whatever the hell you want. Probably the main rule would be "don't piss on another immortal's parade." (let's hope we're somebody's garden project). Ultimately you end up at the top of the spectrum unless the universe dies before then. On the flip-side, given infinite time everything is plausible. So either set a death date for the universe and make a culture set out to have a blast and do whatever the individual wants, or pick whatever culture you want to have and pick whether it devolves into whimsy, laziness, or spite, spirals off through the culture continuum, or cycles back on itself stably. TL;DR They either are having fun still and maybe we're part of the game, or they're not and no one would want to join them because they're either insane or depressed. The first isn't likely to invite a bug to the party, and the second would squish it (or we'd have wished they did). 

If you mean kinetic energy, adding kinetic energy to a particular part of the body usually relaxes it. Blood flow frequently increases. Increased blood flow means that the immune system can sometimes deal differently with the related tissue. Cancer get's today already treated by focusing energy through radiction on specific parts. If the magic can identify successfully which cells are cancerous it can also kill those cells. 

The atheists would be like creationists in our world. There are plenty of young earth creationists on earth that deny all evidence for evolution and for the earth being older than 10,000 years despite that evidence being overwhelming. David Copperfield manages to fly-on-stage and let elephants disappear. Plenty of atheists would see any evidence for religious miracles as fake. The fact that chriopractics can reduce back pain is backed up by a Cochrane meta-study. You still find plenty of atheists who believe that chriopratics never help anyone. I have spoken with an atheist who would find it troubling if a person goes to a homeopath even in the hypothetical scenario where that homeopath would be the person most likely to cure the person. People have all sorts of worldviews that differ from reality. 

There's almost certainly more points I haven't considered here. Definitely make sure it's consistent though. Cultures tend to bleed across political boundaries for example. Edit: I talked with an armor smith. A major additional point under the military bullet is the fact that you live in your armor at war, so ceremonial/tournament armor would be designed differently than war armor. 

Agree with Joe Bloggs answer. But for fun let's investigate Temporal Ethics: Would Temporal Ethics develop in most time-lines with confirmed time-travel? Almost certainly. It's certainly an easier topic than regular Ethics. for simplicities sake let's define a minimal ethics framework. You have a moral choice, a moral action, a goal state, and a moral function. A choice can be moral but the action could be unsuccessful in actuating the choice. Likewise if observed individually the morality of an action or choice could change (local, "kill one", versus global, "save many", properties). You have a goal that you're optimizing for (most number of people with most happiness, etc.). You also have a guiding function that let's you determine morality (religion, common opinion, game theoretic, random, etc.) in relation to the goal. Much of ethics will deal with what is good and bad and try to precisely define the function. Regular ethics will likewise try to define the goal state as it provides a reference for building the metric that is the guiding function. But there's good news! Temporal Ethics need only concern itself with the temporal aspects. That is, we don't need to define what is good, that's for regular ethics, we just need to define how our temporal aspects relate to the classical problem. The entirety of Temporal Ethics in actuality would be concerned with pinning down what time-travel is and how it effects the current time-line, as well as determining the dangers and weighing them in risk analysis, since regular ethics covers the other questions. As luck would have it we have WOG on the physics of the matter so we can bypass the quibbling part of Temporal Ethics and get down to what the "Final Conclusions" would be. Is there a justification or even an imperative to build a time machine and travel with it if the present cannot be changed? No. Based on your premise, you cannot affect your own time-line whatsoever, if you could (destabilize the universe or whatever) then you could communicate and the main time-line would be self-reinforcing OR paradoxical. So, since we know there is no effects, there is no downside to time-travel. Each time-traveler basically makes his own universe when he travels. He populates a universe with initial conditions based off of however he acted to change the time-line and cause the split. He basically sets the goal to optimize for, he sets the goal. With two caveats: the moral functions that the people develop may not coincide with the "spawner's" goal. And there may be a "super-goal" either by being carried forward from the root of the tree or from an "extra-universal thing". If you keep traveling until you get to a universe that's altruistic/egotistic enough for you then you're really just tweaking your initial conditions until you get it right for what you want. Each attempt abandons the universes you were in prior. Would it become a moral imperative (good) to change the past for the better even though that won’t affect one’s own present? No. There are two ways of looking at this: "Existential Probability" and "Existential Certainty". In the probability you want to increase the number of universes that are "good" so that the many copies of other folks might somehow live a "better" life, for some definition of "better" :). Now the problem is that you already have a main/prime time-line that is "good"/"bad". IF your initial jump does not cause perfect "good" you're screwed statistically. If you create a "bad" universe you'll have to jump again to try to do better. If you create one with the same level of "good" as the main universe you've achieved none of your goal. You have actually made it worse because each jump further increases the value of N, where N is the number of universes. Your goal as an altruistic time-traveler is to increase the average "good". Even a perfectly neutral jump diminishes the returns from future efforts. Likewise one "bad" jump could take a long time to repair. Since your first travel "determines" the average for a fairly significant amount of time you would NOT travel unless you were extremely certain of the results or desperate in your own time-line. Which brings us firmly into the risk-analysis territory of "Temporal Ethics". The other option to look at the morality is "Existential Certainty". Rather than discussing odds you discuss "empirical facts". YOU exist. You cannot effect another you. When you decide to travel, the new you is created on a separate time-line and the old one stays home unaffected. Since you are isolated you exists entirely within your current universe. Which may or may not have one time-traveler. You are certain of your existence. You are also certain that everything, including yourself, is existing in your universe and the probabilistic "good" matters not one lick, you have certainty, you can measure things and they will be unaffected by anything having to do with time-travel. You only can have zero time-travelers present if you're in the main universe. Otherwise there was certainly one time-traveler in your universe. Likewise you are certain that no time-travelers will ever enter your universe because the only one allowed always existed since the beginning. In fact, you might owe your existence to said person. The time-traveler leaving could cause an exiting effect on your universe (related to what is coming: We have no way of determining the effect of you leaving on the universe prior to your arrival in said universe). Since you could potentially independently time-travel you can be assured that your traveler leaving will not cause your universe to disappear. (Unless there's restrictions on time-travel outside of the main time-line which makes "Probabilistic Existence" increasingly more of a risky prospect). If you have all theses certainties then it doesn't matter if you travel. Everything in the new universe will have these same certainties and they will be permanent on entry. You can only create, never destroy. If existence is defined as "bad" in your new universe then they can easily destroy themselves, or in a pinch you can lend a hand. Otherwise they get what they have for "good" and "bad", they can change it themselves by either ordinary means or time-travel to a new universe with different "good"/"bad" ratios. Crucially, they cannot affect any other "good" or "bad" in any pre-existing universe. So as long as you existed before the created universe then "good" and "bad" mean nothing to you as far as time-traveling. And if you existed after then you just have to set about fixing whatever you find wrong. (Note that I don't consider that we should consider the feelings of the created universe. They don't matter. Simply because the probabilities are spread across the gamut of possibilities for "good" and "evil" and we have no objective way to deterministically quantify the amounts for all of time in the created universe or our own. So since you can't consider it: you shouldn't consider it. The best you could do is plot risk analysis for you unknown unknowns vs your known unknowns, which is ridiculous in this context since you can't even qualify your known knowns with a known amount of error.). Basically it boils down to "Don't do it unless you have a really good reason" vs "Do what you want". The only reason you need to consider the first one is if the laws of time-travel change off of the main time-line. Since WOG says they are a constant set of rules that really boils down to "Do what you want". In-universe though, the risk analysis will boil down to "Don't do it unless you have a really good reason" modified by our certainty in how the physics of time-travel works across time-lines. Would it be considered bad to actively or passively create time-lines that are worse for humanity overall than the uninflicted one? Depending on whether you look at it as probability or not we are once again divided on the pervasive thought. As far as actively creating them (versus "passively" as a result of going where you want...) you would probably only actively create time-lines if "existence" was valued highly by your moral function AND/OR the multi-verse was interpreted as "Probabilistic" as a whole. In the scenario where "existence" was was valued high enough by your moral function to lead to creation then the "quality of existence" would probably be inconsequential (although it could easily be factored in). If we're under a probabilistic scenario then it is definitely immoral. We of course know whether it is a probabilistic scenario or not, but in-universe they don't. So they will do as all risk analysis does and assume the worst. As such, creation of sub-par universes on purpose would definitely be seen as the height of immorality (you just slighted an entire universe!) accidental creation of sub-par would be unethical but could be fudge-factored via the "existence" part of the moral function into ethical. Would it be better justified to improve the present by importing knowledge from the future or by changing the past? *Only justified in a probabilistic context and only when risk vs benefit is carefully weighed.* As for a rough risk analysis: the only bad scenario is a "Probabilistic Existence" with a "bad" universe resulting from the travel. As long as the the probability of a "bad" universe is non-zero it is likely to happen at some point if you travel. You can't control universes outside your own. Sadly, N could be growing exponentially and your universe could have absolutely no say in it outside of the possibility of you making the initial choice not to time-travel. If you're not the main universe, you're likely screwed from influencing the relative "good" since you can realistically be expected to only ever be able to affect 100/N percent of the total "good"/"bad" ratio, where N is fixed at whatever it was when you decide to time-travel. This is because, since if you came into existence from time-travel it stands to reason that other time-travel events may have occurred and any time-travel choice you make may be duplicated for each branch in the tree.) If the chance of branches increasing is decently high then the "Probabilistic Existence" devolves into "Certain Existence" because, out of the likely-constantly-increasing choices going on among the branches, you will have almost no determining effect on the outcome. So just like "Certain Existence" this case assigns no moral value to time-travel, "Just do what you want". Building and running a time-machine is unlikely to be easy and cheap, so only already powerful future entities (like governments) can start a time-travel program. Are their motives more likely to be in line with the principles of Temporal Ethics than that of a random rogue individual? Probably they will be ethical. Since it all boils down to risk analysis anyway, which they are certainly going to apply from an economic standpoint at the very least. We can be relieved as outsiders since we can know that their choice is inconsequential anyways. As in-universe people we can be relieved since we know they are going to be more sensible than a rogue mad doctor. 

The government of the country in which the company operate can simply pass laws to regulate the company and the pricing of the service. Even if the company would set it self up in some third world country which they can controls wars might be fought over the technology. 

If all words in the language match 1-to-1 to English words, it's basically simply a code for English. Pitjantjatjara for example doesn't have a word that means what the English word means. Even European languages differ in the contexts the have. If I want to translate the German word Polish offers me one choice with according to Leo. On the other hand English offers me 8 choices: , , , , , and . English allows to make much more distinctions then Polish when talking about probabilities. On the other hand the English languages uses words like or in lot's of different ways. To be essentially serves the purpose of four terms of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage location, existence, specification and possession. Letting 4 of the 56 most important concepts of a language be represented by the same word seems very wasteful and yet English works fine. This means that your language can also reuse words if you don't have enough words. Depending on the purpose of your language you don't have to add all the word at the start. When you find that you currently can't talk about something that would be important you can just add new words. 

This question reminds me of a game I used to play: "If you had to change one thing to cause the apocalypse what would it be?" My favorite was always getting rid of friction. Too many fun ways to die with that one. So maybe pray to god for that? Or if you have to do it all on your own (prayers didn't do much...), you could break into a biodefense lab and throw a few vials into the wind at each major airport. If you were smart enough you could engineer HIV to be a deadly airborne disease. I'm sure that kills pretty much everybody. 

Assuming everyone has access and is now immortal you'll probably have suicide become legal, childbirth regulation, and maybe even government culling. I pretty much agree with the other answers on the other points. 

To make entropy control into magic... What about a universe made of ternary pieces of information? 1, 0, and 0.5 with the middle being entropy and the extremes being inverse information. If you manipulate entropy then you're subtracting or adding 0.5 to your piece of information (but only as long as it stays on the 0 side). To us "1-siders" a 0.5 is representationally a zero since it's the entropy point on our axis. If we assume that 0.5 and 0 appear equal (0 is information that doesn't apply to our "1-sider axis"). Then you can hide magic in the 0 side. If you construct an information blob in 0's and entropy (0.5's) then when you add information evenly to the blob it flips to 1's and entropy (0.5's). Scientific laws stay the same because to the 1's side entropy and "0 information" are identical. You can't read 0 information unless your performing magic. It's always "lost". So now you have the choice of whether you want (real life) entropy to be destroyed information or just shifted to the 0 & 0.5 encoding. If it's lost then you can't push 0.5 to 0 unless you're performing magic. Regardless, you can have another world hiding in the 0-side and you can even constrain yourself to just "producing entropy" and still perform magic: If you only subtract 0.5 from pieces of 1-information/entropy and construct a gradient in potential then when the potential flows it creates energy. Usable energy is information. Anything with structure and direction is information and usable energy definitely has direction. If your 1-side works on 1 and 0.5 values then energy flow is a flow of information that adds 0.5 to whatever it crosses (subtracting 0.5 from 1 wherever the energy was generated (this is your heat production, etc.)). As the energy flows over your special configuration it activates it and makes it real information. You could also have the 0-side act like 1-side information but be indistinguishable and get up to shenanigans that way. Semi-Clarification (It's still a fuzzy idea): When we're working with binary states entropy isn't a 1 or a 0. Its definition is instead related to the amount of information we can hold versus how much we're actually holding. Same is true for a ternary state. The catch here is that we only have access and effects from two states. We basically have 1 and +0 and -0. With no way to tell if a zero is negative or not. We've altered entropy's definition here. Since no information actually ever becomes entropy in actuality. It appears as if its entropy whenever there's a 0. That's because each "bit" doesn't store 2 pieces of information, it stores 3. But we can only access the 1 and 0 difference so we can only read 2 pieces of information. We "lose" 1 piece whenever it goes to 0. The definition of entropy here has shifted towards defining any 0 as a piece of entropy. This model assumes information is never created or destroyed. Just rearranged, hidden, and unhidden. How about the standard illustration about 2 gasses in a container that mix after a partition is removed? How is it made of 0,.5,1 values, and how does adding 0.5 make the gas mix or unmix? I'm going to move to a lattice model of the universe with information describing the system. Let's assume momentum as a primary quantity. Vector is in a 1, +0 representation. Move it into a +0,-0 representation (add entropy). You've killed momentum but saved state. Manipulate as needed. In the example we need an incoming momentum of (0.5,0.5,0.5) (which is physically none) to reverse our process. That momentum is the same physically as (0,0,0) but informationally is different. Can we add that from nowhere? Physically that's creating energy and reducing entropy from adding two pieces of entropy. If that's not acceptable you'd need to set it up so that when the area outside of our manipulation adds in its quantities we have a vector set up so that the result is our inverted vector which also adds in the possibility of nearby magic messing with us. Example: (1,0.5,1) -> (0.5,0,0.5) -> (0,0.5,0) + (0.5,0.5,0.5) = (0.5,1,0.5) The example "inverts" the vector after moving it into "entropy land". You could also just subtract (0.5,0,0.5) twice. When added momentum influences that region it will be in the form of 1 and +0 (remember +0 is code for 0.5). Note that our "vector" isn't truly "inverted" momentum-wise, we have no negative quantities as described. The above is also a toy thought experiment because I'm not sure what happens when a "1.5" would appear (It can't happen because the ternary system doesn't allow it. A 1.5 is really 0 with overflow of 0.5. Does that excess disappear, propagate to the next cell, is it disallowed from happening, or do something else?) That's why this answer was meant to be a comment. The system needs to fleshed out and can be tackled in many different ways, all with unique methods of manipulation to cause certain effects. You also need to state what your primary quanta are and describe them. If its a simulation on a machine that's fairly easy. Just take your bits of RAM and make them tri-state. Your program becomes the description. 

Let's start by understanding where the idea that demon's can be controlled by knowing their name comes from. Other answers highlite that many cultures throughout history separate considered a name to have power. That raises the question about the experience that make people believe that names have power. From a modern perspective rituals that are about summoning demons are similar to what's done in Family Systems Therapy and Systemic Therapy. Part of Systemic Therapy is it to address parts with their name. A name binds a concept in a way that makes it easier to address the concept in a systemic constellations. The Focusing framework of Eugine Gendlin with has 80 scientific papers in it's favor also has finding a name (a handle) as an essential part to talk to an internal part. There are mental processes that happen when a mental concept is given a handle. Processes that make it easier to influence those concepts. Many other psychological interventions use finding names as part of their process. Historically a daemon is usually an entity that's tasked that's brought to consciousness and then get's tasked with doing something in the background. That's the point of most magick rituals summoning daemons. That usage of the word daemon is strong enough that your computer runs daemons in the background. If you want to shut down daemons in your computer than you need the name of the daemon to do so. In Linux of you know it's name is you can simply write on the command line and the daemon is killed. Depending on how daemons work in your world they could work similar to computer programs with can get a physical form when summoned into this world.
