Got it. I remember browsing the pages of this book. But it was in Greek, and it does not appear to have been published also in English: Euclidean Economics: A Mathematical Method for Construction and Application of Economics Models 

The term is "volume discounting", where a supplier offers/accepts a lower unit price in exchange for higher volume of business. Here, it is the firm/buyer that asks for this volume discount, rather than the suppliers/users that offer it as a commercial policy. Note that when the buyer demands a volume discount (when it sets $x$) some conditions must be satisfied in order to be even feasible. Assume $m$ tasks identical as regards the costs that the user has to incur (time etc). Denote the cost per task $c_a$. For a single task the user is paid $p$, so its net payoff is $p-c_a$. Taking on multitasking, the user will be paid in total $m\cdot (p-x)$ and its costs will be $m\cdot c_a$. In order to take on multitasking it must hold that $$ m\cdot (p-x-c_a) > p-c_a$$ A necessary but not sufficient condition for this to hold is that $$p-x-c_a > 0 \implies x < p -c_a$$ which places an uper bound on $x$, a bound that depends on supplier costs $c_a$. So the firm/buyer that sets $x$ must have a good idea about what $c_a$ might be. Assume that this holds. Then we need $$m > \frac {p-c_a}{p-x-c_a}$$ The higher the reduction $x$ in price per task the more tasks a user must take on. This may seem like providing an incentive to the buyer to set the requested $x$ as bigger as possible, but it may be the case that the reduction in unit price is so large that the user cannot take on the necessary number due to physical constraints. Let a maximum possible number of tasks that the agent can hanlde be $\bar m$. Then we need as a necessary condition $$\frac {p-c_a}{p-x-c_a} < \bar m$$ so that there exist feasible number of tasks $m$ below the maximum, and above the minimum number required to have higher profitability of the supplier/agent. Re-arranimng for $x$ we obtain $$x< \left(1-\frac 1{\bar m}\right)(p-c_a)$$ which is tighter than the previous necessary condition on $x$. So the fimr/buyer must also have a good idea about what the value of $\bar m$ is. Otherwise the whole plan runs the risk of not being adopted by the user. A situation where the above becomes more feasible is when $c_a$ is not fixed per task but at least initially declines with multi-tasking. 

The household side of this model is pretty standard. Denote $K(t)$ be household's assets at time $t$. Then the transversality condition (which is an optimizing condition, not a constraint), is $$\lim_{t \to \infty} [e^{-\rho t}\lambda(t) K(t)] = 0$$ where $\lambda(t)$ is the current value multiplier on assets in the Hamiltonian. Given the assumed form of the utility function we have the f.o.c. $$\lambda(t) = \frac {1}{c(t)^{\theta}}$$ So we want $$\lim_{t \to \infty} [e^{-\rho t}\frac {1}{c(t)^{\theta}} K(t)] = 0$$ and since in the model we have a constant consumption growth rate, $g_c$ we have $$c(t)^{\theta} = c(0)^{\theta}\cdot e^{g_c\theta t}$$ Ignoring inconsequential constants, we require $$\lim_{t \to \infty} [\frac {1}{e^{(\rho+g_c\theta) t}} K(t)] = 0$$ Use the relation between household assets and the number of goods $N$, the relation between income (from labor and assets) to aggregate output, as well as the expression of aggregate output as a function of $N$, to obtain a first-order linear differential equation in $N$, and proceed as in pages 208-209 of the book. 

A physicist a chemist and an economist are stranded in a deserted island after a wreckage. They have managed to salvage a case of canned food, but they have nothing to open the cans, and the island is a true paradise -meaning, all sand and beaches and soft bushes -but no stones, nothing hard. The physicist and the chemist try to put their scientific knowledge to work by conjuring forces of nature, gravity, pressure, materials science, inorganic chemistry etc, but they can't make them to work in their favor, they lack the necessary infrastructure to do it. Meanhwile, the economist is laying on the side, enjoying the sun and smiling, a bit cockily. -Why do you smile? - Ask the scientists, angry and frustrated -Because I have the solution - replies the economist -Which is? - challenge the scientists The economist looks up, with a trace of pity in his eyes, gets up and says very confidently: 

I can give you literature. An authoritative book on the subject is Koenker, R. (2005). Quantile regression. Cambridge university press.. In there we read (p.126) 

Using the previous result, we have that $$i \in [A,C] : \min \int_{A}^{C} l_{ji}di= \left(\frac {A+C}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{(A+C)^2}{2}+\frac 12 (A^2+C^2)$$ $$...\implies i \in [A,C] : \min \int_{A}^{C} l_{ji}di = \frac {(A-C)^2}{4} = \frac {(C-A)^2}{4}$$ But the numerator is the squared length of this jurisdiction. We are also told that each public good must be offered in each jurisdiction, and also that all jurisdictions must cover the whole interval, without overlapping (for the $j$-level we are examining). These imply that for the whole unitary interval we get $$\min \int_{0}^{1} l_{ji}di = \sum_{x=1}^{N_{j}} s_{xj}^{2}/4$$ So it is the total distance after optimizing for the location of the public good in each jurisdiction. Finally, 

Assume the simplest linear regression model $$y = bx + u$$ The OLS etimator for $b$ is $$\hat b_{OLS} = \frac {\sum x_iy_i}{\sum x_i^2} = b + \frac {\sum x_ie_i}{\sum x_i^2}$$ Whatever the true $b$ is (it is zero in your case, as another answer pointed out) , the fact is that $$\text{plim} \frac {n^{-1}\sum x_ie_i}{n^{-1}\sum x_i^2} \neq 0 $$ and so the OLS estimator will be inconsitent (and also, biased too). 

The equation is exactly the same, $$r(t) = R(t) - \delta$$ Now, set $\delta =1$ per assumptions, to obtain $$r(t) = R(t) - 1 \implies 1+r(t) = R(t)$$ which reasonably continues to say that the accepted rental rate of capital $R(t)$, covers the depreciation rate plus $r(t)$ which is also the net return to capital. 

By stnadard OLS regression results, in the simple regression $$y_t = \alpha + \beta z_t + v_t, \;\;\;t=1,...,T$$ we have that $$\hat \beta = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^T (z_t - \bar z)(y_t-\bar y)}{\sum_{i=1}^T (z_t - \bar z)^2}$$ and $$\hat \alpha = \bar y - \hat \beta \bar z$$ So the residuals are $$\hat v_t = y_t -(\hat \alpha +\hat \beta z_t)$$ Then, substitute for your particular $y_t$ and $z_t$ in all the above. 

I find that the system is saddle-path stable. Setting $z\equiv 1/k$ we get \begin{eqnarray*} \dot{z} & = & -z^2\left(\frac{\rho}{1+\rho} - \frac{1}{1+\lambda}\right) \\ \\ \dot{\lambda} & = & \rho \lambda - z \end{eqnarray*} The fixed point is $E=\{z^*, \lambda^*\} = \{1, 1/\rho\}$ The Jacobian of this system evaluated at the steady state is \begin{align} J_E = \begin{bmatrix}0& -\frac{\rho^2}{(1+\rho)^2}\\ -1& \rho\end{bmatrix} \end{align} The determinant is $${\rm det}(J_E) = 0-\frac{\rho^2}{(1+\rho)^2} < 0$$ and when the determinant of the Jaconbian in a two-by-two system is negative, the system is saddle-path stable (and so mathematically speaking, unstable), irrespective of whether the trace of the Jacobian (here equal to $\rho>0$) is positive, negative, or zero. Perhaps this could be helpful. 

I think it was in one of Joan Robinson's books where a not just backward-bending but "mirrored S"-shaped labour supply was presented, referring to agricultural societies: 

The proofs I will present are based on techniques relevant to the fact that the CES production function has the form of a generalized weighted mean. This was used in the original paper where the CES function was introduced, Arrow, K. J., Chenery, H. B., Minhas, B. S., & Solow, R. M. (1961). Capital-labor substitution and economic efficiency. The Review of Economics and Statistics, 225-250. The authors there referred their readers to the book Hardy, G. H., Littlewood, J. E., & PÃ³lya, G. (1952). Inequalities , chapter $2 $. We consider the general case $$Q_k=\gamma[a K^{-\rho} +(1-a) L^{-\rho} ]^{-\frac{k}{\rho}},\;\; k>0$$ $$\Rightarrow \gamma^{-1}Q_k = \frac 1{[a (1/K^{\rho}) +(1-a) (1/L^{\rho}) ]^{\frac{k}{\rho}}}$$ 1) Limit when $\rho \rightarrow \infty$ Since we are interested in the limit when $\rho\rightarrow \infty$ we can ignore the interval for which $\rho \leq0$, and treat $\rho$ as strictly positive. Without loss of generality, assume $K\geq L \Rightarrow (1/K^{\rho})\leq (1/L^{\rho})$. We also have $K, L >0$. Then we verify that the following inequality holds: $$(1-a)^{k/\rho}(1/L^{k})\leq \gamma Q_k^{-1} \leq (1/L^{k}) $$ $$\implies (1-a)^{k/\rho}(1/L^{k})\leq [a (1/K^{\rho}) +(1-a) (1/L^{\rho}) ]^{\frac{k}{\rho}} \leq (1/L^{k}) \tag{1}$$ by raising throughout to the $\rho/k$ power to get $$(1-a)(1/L^{\rho}) \leq a (1/K^{\rho}) +(1-a) (1/L^{\rho}) \leq (1/L^{\rho}) \tag {2}$$ which indeed holds, obviously, given the assumptions. Then go back to the first element of $(1)$ and $$\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \infty} (1-a)^{k/\rho}(1/L^{k}) =(1/L^{k})$$ which sandwiches the middle term in $(1)$ to $(1/L^{k})$ , so $$\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \infty}Q_k = \frac {\gamma }{1/L^k} = \gamma L^k = {\gamma }\big[\min\{K,L\}\big]^{k} \tag{3}$$ So for $k=1$ we obtain the basic Leontief production function. 2) Limit when $\rho \rightarrow 0$ Write the function using exponential as $$\gamma^{-1}Q_k=\exp\left\{-\frac k{\rho}\cdot \ln\big[a (K^{\rho})^{-1} +(1-a) (L^{\rho})^{-1}\big]\right\} \tag {4}$$ Consider the first-order Maclaurin expansion (Taylor expansion centered at zero) of the term inside the logarithm, with respect to $\rho$: $$a (K^{\rho})^{-1} +(1-a) (L^{\rho})^{-1} \\= a (K^{0})^{-1} +(1-a) (L^{0})^{-1} -a (K^{0})^{-2}K^{0}\rho\ln K- (1-a) (L^{0})^{-2}L^{0}\rho\ln L + O(\rho^2) \\$$ $$=1 - \rho a\ln K - \rho(1-a)\ln L+ O(\rho^2) = 1 +\rho \big[\ln K^{-a}L^{-(1-a)}\big]+ O(\rho^2)$$ Insert this back into $(4)$ and get rid of the outer exponential, $$\gamma^{-1}Q_k = \left(1 +\rho \big[\ln K^{-a}L^{-(1-a)}\big]+ O(\rho^{2})\right)^{-k/\rho}$$ In case it is opaque, define $r\equiv 1/\rho$ and re-write $$\gamma^{-1}Q_k = \left(1 +\frac{\big[\ln K^{-a}L^{-(1-a)}\big]}{r}+ O(r^{-2})\right)^{-kr}$$ Now it does look like an expression whose limit at infinity will give us something exponential: $$\lim_{\rho\rightarrow 0}\gamma^{-1}Q_k = \lim_{r\rightarrow \infty}\gamma^{-1}Q_k = \left(\exp\left\{ \ln K^{-a}L^{-(1-a)}\right\} \right)^{-k}$$ $$\Rightarrow \lim_{\rho\rightarrow 0}Q_k =\gamma\left(K^{a}L^{1-a}\right)^k$$ The degree of homogeneity $k$ of the function is preserved, and if $k=1$ we obtain the Cobb-Douglas function. It was this last result that made Arrow and Co to call $a$ the "distribution" parameter of the CES function. 

Using the given formulas (inserting the expression for the $X$'s in the sum), we arrive at $$Y_t = (1-\beta_0)\alpha_0\cdot t + \beta_0\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}X_j +\sum_{j=1}^{t}W_j $$ We do not need a theorem to obtain that, given the description of the problem. Manipulating, $$Y_t= (1-\beta_0)\alpha_0\cdot t - \beta_0(X_t-X_0) + \beta_0Y_{t} +\sum_{j=1}^{t}W_j$$ $$\implies Y_t = \alpha_0t +\frac{1}{1-\beta_0}\sum_{j=1}^{t}W_j-\frac{\beta_0}{1-\beta_0}(X_t-X_0)$$ and we want to match this with $$Y_t = r_1 t + M_t - r_2 (X_t - X_0)$$ We immediately get that we must have $r_1 = \alpha_0$, $r_2 = \beta_0/(1-\beta_0)$, and $$M_t = \frac{1}{1-\beta_0}\sum_{j=1}^{t}W_j$$ Is $M_t$ as obtained a martingale? We have $$E[M_t\mid \sigma(t-1,t-2,..)] = \\=\frac{1}{1-\beta_0}E[W_t\mid \sigma(t-1,t-2,..)] + \frac{1}{1-\beta_0}\sum_{j=1}^{t-1}W_j$$ $$= \frac{1}{1-\beta_0}E[W_t\mid \sigma(t-1,t-2,..)] + M_{t-1}$$ So if $E[W_t\mid \sigma(t-1,t-2,..)] = 0$, namely, if the original disturbance is mean-independent from the past (in a more fancy term, if $\{W_t\}$ is a "Martingale difference"), then $M_t$ is a martingale and we have our mapping.
