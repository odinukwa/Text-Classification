Are repeated climbs on a small hill comparable to a single climb up a larger hill, in terms of training for miles-long climbs in the race? 

A technique that has proven useful to me is to run barefoot on pavement and gravel. The roughness of the surface maximizes the sensory input to your feet, and the hardness of the surface calls attention to any excessive impacts or inefficiencies further up the foot/leg/knee/hip joints. I often run the first mile or two of a workout barefoot on pavement as a way to maintain a "muscle memory" of good form. You can start by standing on the pavement or gravel, getting a feel for what the surface feels like "at rest", and then walking in place for a few steps, then bouncing and jogging in place, and then begin moving forward. As you transition from standing to moving in place to running, pay attention to how the surface feels on the soles of your feet, how your feet are landing and lifting, how your muscles and joints feel. I've found that even very small adjustments in foot placement, hip movement, knee bend, cadenece, etc., are can be measured by watching for changes in the level of comfort or pain felt on these sorts of surfaces. But this is a rather subjective technique that I think is only useful in conjunction with learning about good form from other sources, etc. Thus I would be very interested in seeing a more thorough answer than this that describes some more objective techniques to self-assess running form. 

For biceps whole week to rest is way too much. Chest usually needs 2 days of rest. Your front actons of deltoids can be a bit tired, during shoulders day. Well, that also depends on your age. I can't see legs, back here. Even if you don't want to build them up - that is good for testosterone level, at least. So your chest can gain from that. To be more precise I need to know what you are doing during each training. 

Watch at YT - for instance this, or simply buy his book. It is really inexpensive. There are some videos of Kelly Starrett - I've putted overhead press - since at the top mechanism, and a specially potential problems - looks the same. There are some points here - you need to stretch your body bottom up. Be sure not to use your spine instead of shoulders to keep hands up. If you have pain in your back, at the end of ribs, perhaps that is the problem. Having proper general body position, move blade-bones back, and down. That way you open shoulders, with proper stability. There is something named rotation cuff, all that is attached to top of arm bone, plus biceps - having it open means less chance of conflict, so less chance of injury. If you are unsure - do tests - they are easy. Please watch this video. Well, all that names, acronyms are not so easy, but they do great job describing what is the problem. 

You don't need to "go easy" by sticking to softer surfaces, whether barefoot or in minimal shoes, and by doing so you are likely to miss a lot of key lessons about proper form as the surface is more forgiving. Just a few runs on pavement or gravel can really fine-tune your form and teach you how to run efficiently and avoid injury. These lessons will apply to minimalist shoes and cushion shoes too. I like to do a few miles barefoot at the beginning of a long run to fine-tune my form, on a variety of surfaces including asphalt or gravel, and this carries over nicely to the main part of the run performed in Vibrams. Regarding overpronation I'm not an expert about this, but I think focusing on form could help a lot as you spend more item in minimalist shoes. I developed knee pain earlier this year due I'm pretty sure to overpronation and a tight hip flexor, even while wearing minimalist shoes. By focusing on form I've nearly eliminated the problem. Occasional barefoot running has taught me to increase my cadence a little more, correctly align my hips and feet, land more lightly, and run downhill properly—even while wearing minimalist shoes or traditional shoes. This has nearly eliminated my pronation and knee problems. Regarding sore feet 

+1 for me - this is purely genetics. Shape of muscle, how it it attached, is "defined" by your genetics. You can train to have bigger pecs, or go down with fat. That way you can make things like that visible, but shape - that is out of control. Go to google type 'pectoralis body building' and see how many different shapes are there. All that chest are great, yet different. 

In short. They do complex exercises, not isolated. That way many muscles are trained at once, however with particular focus. So perhaps that is an answer. As a side note - I'm quite skeptic, when it comes to articles - "train as ...". To be like an army ranger, I need to do a lot more physical activity. I'm working at the office, sitting whole day. So for them gym is somewhat accessory, for me - that is main training. Besides that I think that they do some other exercises, as well - like running. 

There is idea of using antagonists, called super sets. That way you train - for instance - biceps and triceps in consecutive sets. When biceps is used, your triceps is relaxing. Triceps is not used, but also that is how our neural system works. That is one of Joe Weider's rules. Please look, for instance here. Note that in your example that is not 100% super set - long head of triceps is used by both chest, and back exercises. Usually that limits this kind of "splits" for people with smaller experience. Not to mention that with arching during bench press - back is activated. I see that you assumed that during chest set, back is resting. However overall load can influence that as well. Try to do additional jogging before chest day. Usually that means more energy burned, and your body needs some time to be prepared for that. Same goes with additional exercises. In long term, with plan - that can be good idea. But short term - you can see drop in performance. So there is not easy answer, or your question is a bit too broad. Other point refers to size of the muscle. For bigger muscles, you can take much higher weights, but they also relax longer. So if I feel my chest burning, while triceps are not - I can do back exercise to relax chest, and balance stress during chest day. If that is not true, I can do biceps exercise. That goes a bit against previous paragraph, but - I'm writing about long term, and prefer to do something then to sit and wait, or watch my phone... If you look for gain - plan is key. Muscles are growing during day or two after being stressed. If you train too much - large groups - like back, legs - needs, even 5 days to rest. So your muscles could get more impulses to grow, with limited soreness. Hope it answers your question. 

Again, don't overdo it. If after some time you can't seem to get past a certain number of miles in minimalist shoes without this problem, then you may need to seek a more experienced opinion than mine. Also, if the top of your foot gets sore, then you may need to tweak the way you wear and lace your shoe, or possibly consider a different type or size of minimalist shoe. Because they fit small and snug, there can be a lot of pressure on the top of the foot from the laces or straps. Added in 2014: These days, there are many styles of “minimalist” or zero heel drop shoes. I have found that the feel and fit can vary dramatically among brands and styles, and is a very personal choice. Especially with ultra-minimal shoes, it is essential that it fits well and feels comfortable; these shoes tend to amplify any problems with fit. If soreness or other problems are persistent with Vibrams, try a different style, perhaps a zero-drop shoe with more substantial construction and cushioning. As long as it’s comfortable, I have found that bulkier ZHD shoe works basically the same way biomechanically. Next steps I think you can continue to gradually increase the distance you run in your minimalist shoes. I was able to complete 12 mile runs in my first year with no problem, and 16 miles the following year, and it sounds like you're in better shape than I am (I've never attempted a marathon for example). The “transitioning tips” bullet points at the end of the Vibram FAQ sound like good guidelines. There should be no problem with wearing other shoes for some portion of your runs until you get to the point that you're ready and willing to use minimalist shoes or go barefoot 100% of the time. In the first two years I used traditional running shoes on roads, and I still use heavier shoes during the winter months. When you run in your other shoes, try to imagine that you're in minimalist shoes and apply the form you use there in your other shoes. This can only work to a certain degree of course, but that could help you maintain your form. You may find that you will be running better in both types of shoes. My background I started running with minimalist shoes 2 1/2 years ago, and by the end of that year I was doing 90% of my runs in Vibrams (excluding winter runs in snow). This year, I added true barefoot running to the mix, doing that about 30% of the time now. Before getting into minimalist shoes, I wore a variety of cushion shoes from the basic road shoes to some pretty heavy duty trail shoes.
