If you have a power meter than download something like Golden Cheetah to analyse the data. Otherwise, if you are just using Strava's predictive data - I wouldn't bother as it won't be accurate enough for detailed analysis. 

CO2 Cannister - beats a pump any day for getting up and rolling again quickly. But always carry a pump for backup. Invest in clothing. There's an increasing trend to Rain / Wind jerseys rather than full-on rain jackets. My favourites are the SS Castelli Gabba and the SS Sportful Fiandre. Gilet, arm-warmers, knee and leg warmers. Versatile kit as part of a layering system. A matter of taste for some - but cycling caps. keep the sweat and sun out of the eyes in the summer. And head warm(er) in the winter. GPS - Make sure it is ANT+ compliant and you might want to check if it is power-meter compatible. Just in case ... Neoprene overshoes. Great for keeping the feet warm and dry. Toolkit - if you don't have already - should also have a chain-splitter and a tyre boot. Although a gel wrapper makes a great tyre boot. ICE - in case of emergency. Necklace, bracelet or card. Join a club. 

Measuring wear on a cassette is more difficult. It is usually the middle set of sprockets which wear first - due to their more frequent use. If examined carefully - you may notice the teeth on them thinning. 

The quality of the bike is in the sum of the parts. The heart of the bike is the frame and what carries the brand is more often than not - the frame. The manufacturer then hangs various components off the frame to complete the build. (Big brands) It could be argued - the quality of the frame (design and build) & warranty back-up is better. Other factors could be frame material and design. At the lower end of the market where you are looking for a hardtail frame - it is a fair bit harder for manufacturers to make their product standout from their competitors (such are the complexities of welding 9 pipes as opposed to designing suspension). And its probably where the brand name will have greater weighting in the buying decision. Markups are also lower at this end of the market and manufacturers will use plenty of own-brand / OEM components to keep their margins higher. Have a look closely at the component spec. as well as the brand. Manufacturers are great at hiding the down spec of a component ie. cassettes or brake calipers being common examples. Google for reviews. If you intend to keep the bike for years and not intend to go on the upgrade path - than perhaps you should be looking at the overall package (component level) as well. If you'll upgrade eventually - than the typically better resale value of a bigger brand like Specialized will be a bigger consideration. 

Theoretically, the smaller the number - the higher up the Fulcrum series. Fulcrum produce OEM wheels for manufacturers and these are supplied to manufacturers with "even" numbers which do not appear on the manufacturer's site. The number falling between the official numbering series usually indicates the wheel being an amalgamation of wheel series. This would be something like a 3 series rim with a 5 series hub and so on. The other point with OEM products is they are often made on production lines outside of the mfrs normal line of products. 

Personally, if your road frame is an out-and-out road bike - I would say you will be faced with several issues. 

Single-sided power meters have existed since the "year dot" - and opposite leg power is often "extrapolated" from a single strain gauge And given most power-meters will quote accuracy to be within X% - the use of left and right strain gauges means although accuracy could be within X% of both left and right - it causes problems with precision. So the maximum variation between both strain gauges could be LEFT DRIFT + RIGHT DRIFT. (But both being within X% of true strain). So there is an argument which questions whether left and right power meters are in fact more accurate. And it is possibly the magic of the software / firmware further downstream from the strain gauge signal which provides a coherent reading. From your graph you have posted - you have tight banding of power on the left leg which indicates a smooth pedal stroke on the left-side. Your right side looks choppy like you're stamping on the pedals. This is often described as "pedalling squares". The important thing with power meters is precision (consistency) of the reading. In direct answer to your question - why do people use single-sided power meters - it has inherently been the cost of dual-sided power measurement. However, in the last 2 years - cheaper pedal-based systems have appeared from Garmin and more recently Favero. 

That looks like the quick release mechanism used when removing the tyre to open the caliper a little wider. It looks broken? - it should be tucked under in line with the pull of the cable. Since it isn't the cable is actually pulling the release open as you brake. You might be able to temporarily remedy it by leaving it in the open position and pulling the cable tighter. You would however lose the use of the quick release. Probably not a great idea to run it like this - since the cable will be pulling on the fixing nut at a strange angle. Best replace with a new caliper. 

Some training is always better than no training. It depends how fast you would like to ride the distance. Given you say there are only four weeks before you attempt the distance - and traditional training for an event would also allow 1 week prior to the event for tapering - and one weekend to attempt a distance close to the target distance ~200km. I imagine - that leaves little time for the building of endurance. Typically endurance takes longer to build and on a bike this is often done as base mileage over the winter period. Otherwise known as long, steady miles. As for whether your target is achievable - if you are fit, healthy & motivated - for sure it is. It also depends how hard you want to ride it and how challenging the terrain is. 

So I just managed to remove the fork from the old frame I'm renovating. In the headset bearings, the grease looks odd! 

I'm just back from hospital! I was having fun in a skatepark with my trials bike, and something quite unfortunate happened. Basically, my thumb flexed the wrong way around. That won't stop me though, and I plan to go back as soon as the doctor allows. But I wish I could protect my fingers, at least from flexing the wrong way around. Is there any glove or bandage that could help me? 

So what is the "proper way" to remove the extra paint, if the frame is properly reamed/faced already? Should I choose not to do it the proper way, which components are going to suffer? I suppose at least the headset and bottom bracket, but could the frame suffer as well? 

See these tiny metal balls? At least it looks like that... Is that on purpose, is that debris? The races do not seem to be damaged. If I reuse the same headset, should I try to find the same type of grease, or any waterproof grease would fit? 

I'm almost done assembling my new bike :) There is still one thing in the way though... See the headset in the picture? It was installed by a professional (or, at least a LBS owner) when I bought the frame. Kinda came preinstalled. After assembling the bike, I went back to the shop to have the headset adjusted. And somehow they couldn't get the thing set up properly. I tried too, and yeah, let's face it, that headset is probably bad or badly installed. 

I recently replaced my hubs, and not-so-recently the front brake rotor. In dry conditions, everything works fine, brakes well and makes almost no noise. In rainy conditions, however, the front disk tends to vibrate and make a huge, horn-like noise. Is there something wrong with my brake installation that I should fix, or is this normal? I've never experienced such behavior before. 

I'm planning to build a new bike from scratch. Part of that is buying a new frame, and possibly facing/reaming it. That's actually the part I'm scared of the most. Fortunately, the brand I'm targeting, Surly, seems to do that in the factory. But as they state, there may be some paint left where it should not be: 

In Belgium at least, you are required to take the bicycle lane on your right if it exists. Yet, sometimes, safety would be higher somewhere else. You should always prioritize safety, and it sometimes requires to do barely legal stuff. In that case anyway, people (and most likely cops) will be understanding if you have a good explanation. Keep on mind though that the roads are usually designed to be as safe as possible, and the guys who designed it had a better overview than you have right now. (Most of the time) But never, ever go on a bike lane in the wrong direction. You would endanger yourself and other unsuspecting users. 

I'm having a hard time finding the technical documentation (equivalent of $URL$ for the Shimano Deore Hollowtech 1 crankset, FC-M510. Among others, I'm looking for information about which BB size I should get. Anyone has any info? 

Also would I need to change the "fork race" (referring to the piece attached to the bottom of the fork tube, correct?) if I were to fit a different headset? 

I'm starting renovation work on an old bicycle. One of the things I want to do is a new paint job. I guess before that I'll need to sand the current paint off the frame. So I bought sandpaper. On the back of the sandpaper packaging, they state "beware when sanding lead paint". Makes sense, I guess, don't really want to be intoxicated with lead. A quick research on Internet showed that somes bikes had lead paint or lead rust inhibitor. So the question now is: is my bicycle lead-free? Is there any way to identify lead paint? The bike is an old Flandria, probably dates back to... I have no idea really... 

I have a 10-year old bike, fitted with hydraulic disk brakes. The bike has been actively used for around 4 years only though. Recently, my brake levers started to have more and more "play" before the bike actually starts braking. A kind of a "dead zone" where nothing happens, just like if there was not enough oil. I went to the store to fix it, twice, but it keeps coming back. They say something may be stuck ("bourrage" in french, as ugly as it sounds). They told me they bled the brakes, but at this point I'm not sure anymore. So now I'd like to fix this myself, once and for all. The brakes are the only thing I've been afraid to fiddle with, so far, so that's why I'm coming here for advices. Is there any "fixing your hydraulic disk brakes 101" or equivalent? A guide I could follow to check things in order. Shall I check brake pads first, then oil, then... A flowchart would be lovely! tl;dr: What to check first to fix hydraulic disk brakes? 

can I take my (front + rear) hubs apart while it is still attached to the spokes? is it good enough to visually inspect the hub axle, and decide whether it's safe to use based on that? any other safety concern? 

I just stupidly dropped my helmet on the floor from a quite high distance. I know (or rather, heard of) that motorbike helmets must be inspected in such cases. Is it the same for bike helmets? How can I tell if it is still safe? 

What if it turns out to be lead paint? Is there a safe way to sand it, and be eco-friendly with the resulting dust? Or should I just paint over it? What about the existing rust patches?
