This does not prove there was not an earlier form, but flutterby looks like a easy and pretty, and perhaps even frequent, spoonerism of butterfly which never really entered the English language. 

The position is very difficult to identify. UNCTAD published a major study a couple of years ago called Transnational Corporations, Agricultural Production and Development as part of its World Investment Report 2009. In it, Figure III.13 suggested that China had the third highest outward foreign direct investment stock in agriculture (after the USA and Canada and well ahead of Japan). This has probably grown since then. The rest of the report discusses different forms of investment and potential consequences. One of the conclusions was 

It depends. The Economist ran an article on July 7, 2012 reporting mixed results across states and types of pupils. It pointed to particular gains for the weakest and poorest children and in elementary schools rather than high schools, but with bad results in some states. It highlighted two particular pieces of research, one in 2009 from CREDO at Sanford which said 

No. You would need to find a mechanism, such as arguing that a smoker breathes in filtered smoke which the person next to them breathes in unfiltered smoke. Since almost all smokers do not have a cigarette in their mouths all the time, this is highly dubious. The evidence from second-hand smoke studies is that the risk to the non-smoker is small but clear: examples include an odds ratio for non-smokers exposed to long-term spousal smoking of 1.23 (95% CI = 1.01-1.51) compared with those not exposed, which is small. Other studies have also produced low numbers, such as this. The odds ratios for actual smokers are far higher. This is about relative risk. It is certainly possible for a particular exposed non-smoker to be more affected than a particular smoker (as someone betting in roulette can win with 0 and somebody else lose on red), but overall smoking directly is a far greater risk than exposure to secondhand smoke. 

The paper you link to (Health Phys. 2010 Aug;99(2):105-23.) is a projection using estimates of radiation doses and estimates from other sources to find additional cancers. The doses come from a paper published simultaneously (Health Phys. 2010 Aug;99(2):157-200.) with similar authors. Such studies may be the best you can do when the effect is relatively small. The link in Wikipedia may not give what you were expecting but it is a single click to causes of death which says in 2004 there were 23 deaths from cancer (8.7% of total) and in 2005 15 (5.0%). Another click will take you to deaths by age including under 1 and 1-4 years old. There will be more cancers than this (people with cancer can die for other reasons) and child birth defects which do not cause death, and anyway you would want data back to the 1950s. Even then you would find it hard to untangle other effects such as varying economic growth and health services. 

You quote the claim from Caroline Glick's article which, from the context of General Dan Halutz's resignation, was written in 2007. Her claims are similar to those in the 97-page research document “The Million Person Gap” published in 2006 as BESA report No 65. If you read through BESA, there are essentially three criticisms of the 1997 census figures: 

Many plants are photosensitive and the phases of the moon marginally affect light (though by an extremely minor amount compared with solar seasonal effects, cloud cover or shading), so you might expect a very small effect in some plants. A principle of statistical sampling is that with a large enough sample size it is possible to find statistically significant results which are robust to repeat testing (as opposed to the 5% of experiments which produce apparently statistically significant results simply by chance) even if the effect is not substantial enough to affect behaviour in the real world. There was a study "Effects of Moonlight on Flower Induction in Pharbitis nil, Using a Single Dark Period" by Kadman-Zahavi and Peiper in 1987. The abstract says 

This is the chart from the Office for National Statistics Dikran Marsupial may have been trying to upload: 

I would regard Kiline's translation as a distortion; Augustine was not criticising the methods but the evil sources of predictions. It might be worth looking at the original quote from Augustine, which was in De Genesi ad Litteram libri duodecim (Twelve Books on the Literal Meaning of Genesis) Book 2, 17:37 

There have been some interesting studies by Robert Stickgold at Harvard Medical School that show sleep's role in learning. In an article from Scientific America titled Tetris Dreams, author Kristin Leutwyler provides an overview of some of Stickgold's experiments. 

Is there any reason for a healthy adult to take a daily multi-vitamin? My intuition tells me that an adult eating a healthy and balanced diet will get all of the nutrients she needs and that taking a daily mulit-vitamin would be pointless. 

Eating healthy and exercising is, of course, not guaranteed to make you live longer - you could get hit by a bus tomorrow, after all. Nor is there a causal relationship between the two, as you have cited examples where those who ate healthy and exercised lived a short life. But if you look at a sufficiently large population there is a positive correlation between healthy eating and exercise and life expectancy. One such study that reveals this correlation is the Harvard Nurses' Health Study, which was started in 1976 and continues to follow more than 120,000 female nurses. Initially, the survey assessed risk factors for cancer and cardiovascular diseases, but was later updated to include assessing diet. Some findings from the study include: 

This question is known as the great debate in economics, and it started back in the early 20th century between two leading economists, John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek. The debate was over how best to spur a sluggish economy. Keynes proposed that the government could directly spur a stalled economy through direct investment and stimulus while Hayek countered that such moves might provide a temporary boost, but were not healthy, had unexpected consequences, and simply delayed the day of reckoning. For more background on the Keynes-Hayek debate (albeit with a bit of bias toward Hayek), read Cochran and Glahe's, The Hayek-Keynes Debate – Lessons for Current Business Cycle Research. For a more human-interest look at the lives of these two men and how their theories shaped modern economics, see Wapshott's Keynes-Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics. Unfortunately, when discussing world-wide macro-economics the system is so large, interconnected, and complex that it is impossible to come up with a definitive answer to these types of questions, which is why this Keynes-Hayek debate rages on. There's not a simple positive or negative test that can be applied. For insight on this complexity and the hopelessness of making conclusive statements from such uncertainty, refer to Nassim Taleb's book, The Black Swan. So to answer your question, "Can a government end a recession through job creation?" the honest answer is, "It depends who you ask." 

Soda (nor cola) does not cause osteoporosis. However, studies have shown a correlation between cola consumption and increased risk in osteoporosis. The National Osteoporosis Foundation lists several risk factors, noting that: 

In conclusion, cola does not cause osteoporosis. And it is believed the negative effects of cola consumption can be counterbalanced. As the National Osteoporosis Foundation notes in its risk factors list, "You can help make up for the potential loss of calcium from sodium, excessive protein, too much caffeine and cola drinks by making sure you get enough calcium every day." 

Is there any consensus as to how many words are in the average adult's vocabulary? Over the years, I've come across various factoids and blurbs online and in magazine articles that have made statements like, "The average adult has a vocabulary of 20,000 words." And if there is a consensus, how was such a number arrived at? Is the "20,000 words" claim (or whatever it happens to be) just a guesstimate or are these numbers arrived at in a more mechanical and, ideally, reproducible procedure? Have then been any formal studies in this vein? 

In December 2005, the science magazine Nature conducted a study to determine whether Wikipedia was as accurate as traditional encyclopedias, namely the Encyclopedia Britannica. In Study: Wikipedia as accurate as Britannica, Daniel Terdiman summarizes the study results: 

I've read many articles listing the benefits of buying locally grown food and many of the benefits sound plausible. But today I read the following, which left my skepto-meter tingling (emphasis mine): 

But cola consumption is just one of a plethora of risks. In Soda and Osteoporosis: Is There a Connection?, author Gina Shaw examines the link between the two and has several informative quotes from reputable doctors and researchers in the field. Some choice quotes from the article: 

The Wikipedia article includes citations to news stories and other evidence for many of the incidents listed above.
