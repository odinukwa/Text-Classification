Gehring shows (for p=n=3) in the first equality of Theorem 1 in his paper Extremal length definitions for the conformal capacity of rings in space. $URL$ that the conformal modulus of a ring domain $R$ (defined via measurable functions) can equivalently be defined as the infimum of $\int |Df|^p$ where $f$ varies among $ACL$ functions having boundary values 0 and 1 on the two boundary components of $R$. Moreover he cites on p.138 another paper of himself showing that $ACL$ may be replaced by $C^1$. It seems quite likely that a corresponding characterization also holds for general n and $p$ (not necessarily equal to $n$), maybe even the same proof goes through, see edit below. Assuming that these results also hold for general $p$ and $n$, it follows immediately from the argument on p.142 of the same paper that the conformal modulus of $R$ can also be reached as the infimum over continuous admissible functions. Edit: Actually the whole argument seems to be essentially spelled out in Rickman's book on quasiregular mappings, starting on p.53, section 10. 

The following relies on the answer of Anton Petrunin and his explanations. Set $X:=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$. Claim 0: Each $x\in X$ is a limit point of a sequence $f^n(y)$ for some $y\in M$. Moreover, if $x\in X\cap M^\circ$, then $y$ can be chosen in $M^\circ$. Proof of Claim 0: Assume $x\in X$. Then $x=f^n(y_n)$ for some $y_n\in M$ and each $n\geq 1$. After passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $y_{n_l}\rightarrow y$. Fix $\varepsilon>0$ and $K\geq 1$; we show that for some $k\geq K$, $f^k(y)\in B_\varepsilon(x)$. Choose $l\geq 1$, such that $k:=n_l\geq K$ and $y_{k}\in B_\varepsilon(y)$. Then, since $f$ is distance non-increasing, $dist(f^k(y),f^k(y_k))\leq dist(y,y_k)<\varepsilon$. The 'moreover' statement follows, since we can replace $y$ by $f^{k_0}(y)$, and choose $k_0$ such that $f^{k_0}(y)\in M^\circ$; the latter is possible, since a subsequence of $f^n(y)$ converges to $x\in M^\circ$. Claim 1: For any $x\in M^\circ$ and $r>0$ such that $B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and $n\geq 1$, we have $f^n(B_r(x))=B_r(f^n(x))$. We defer a proof of Claim 1 to the end. Claim 2: $X^\circ$ is nonempty, indeed it coincides with the set of all limit points of sequences $f^n(y)$ for $y\in M^\circ$. Proof Claim 2: By Claim 0, each $x\in X\cap M^\circ \supset X^\circ$ is such a limit point. Conversely, if $x$ is such a limit point, then $x\in B_r(f^k(y))=f^k(B_r(y))\subset f^k(M)$ for (certain) arbitrary large $k$; here we choose $r$ such that $B_r(y)\in M^\circ$ and use Claim 1. Therefore $x\in X=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$, since the intersection is decreasing. Actually the same argument shows, that $B_s(x)\subset X$ for each $s<r$ (or also $s\leq r$). As a consequence $x\in X^\circ$. Claim 3: $X\cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. (Clearly it is also closed, as $M$ is compact and nonempty by Claim 2). Proof Claim 3: Combining Claim 1 and 2, we see that $X\cap M^\circ=X^\circ=X^\circ \cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. As $M^\circ$ is connected, Claim 3 implies: Claim 4: $X\cap M^\circ=M^\circ$. Since $X\subset M$ is closed, it follows that $X=M$, and thus $f(M)=M$. Conclusion:Claim 4 implies that $f$ is a distance preserving homeomorphism by Całka, Corollary 3.5 and Corollary 4.4. In particular, $f(\partial M)=\partial M$. A (standard) proof of Claim 1: First assume n=1: Since $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz, we have $f(B_r(x))\subset B_r(f(x))$ for any $x\in M^\circ$. To show equality, let $y\in B_r(f(x))$ arbitrary. There exists a path (of constant speed) $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ of length $<r$ with $\gamma(0)=f(x)$ and $\gamma(1)=y$. There exists a unique lifting of $\gamma$, i.e. a path $\eta:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ with $f\circ \eta=\gamma$ and $\eta(0)=x$. (The set $T\subset [0,1]$ of $t$'s for which there is a unique lifting of $\gamma$ on the intervall $[0,t]$ contains $0$. $T$ is open since $f$ is a local diffeomorphism on $M^\circ$. In addition, $T$ is closed: If $t_k\in T$ converges to $t\in [0,1]$, then there is a unique lift $\eta_0$ of $\gamma$ on $[0,t)$. Since $M$ is compact and $\eta_0$ is Lipschitz, we can extend it to a path $\eta_1:[0,t]\rightarrow M$, and we have automatically $f(\eta_1(s))=\gamma(s)$ for $s\in [0,t]$. Since $length(\eta_1)=length(\gamma\vert_{[0,t]})<r$ as $f$ is an infinitesimal isometry, we have $\eta_1(t)\in B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and therefore $t\in T$, as desired.) Since $f$ is an (infinitesimal) isometry, length($\eta$)=length$(\gamma)<r$ and thus $\eta(1)\in B_r(x)$. Therefore $y=f(\eta(1))\in f(B_r(x))$, as claimed for $n=1$. For arbitrary $n\geq 2$, note that $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))=B_r(f^{n-1}(x))$ by induction. The domain invariance theorem (applied locally to $f^{n-1}$) implies that $f^{n-1}(M^\circ)\subset M^\circ$; hence if $B_r(x)\in M^\circ$, then so is $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))$. Applying Claim 1 for $n=1$ to the ball $B_r(f^{n-1}(y))$ yields Claim 1 for $n$. 

I'm not sure if we do it anymore, but Berkeley has (used to have?) a "pre-PhD" program. See page 25 of this. Probably some other schools have similar programs as well. 

Configuration space is, by definition, the position space of your particles. Phase space, on the other hand, is the space of pairs (position, momentum). The latter has a symplectic structure; the former has a Riemannian structure. Regarding the relationship between kinetic energy and the Riemannian structure: You will recall from your high school physics class that kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2} mv^2$. Of course the $v^2$ is really the dot product $v \cdot v$, in other words it's $g(v,v)$, where $g$ is the Riemannian metric and $v$ is a tangent vector. The $\frac{1}{2}$ explains the "twice the kinetic energy" part. 

I know almost nothing about quantum groups, but nevertheless I think the first thing to realize is that "deformation" can really be taken as just a synonym for "family". If you are interested in moduli problems, then you are interested in families, and thus deformations. As for why one would be interested in moduli problems... there are many reasons, so maybe you can ask about that in a different question :-) 

The closed string A-model is mathematically described by Gromov-Witten invariants of a compact symplectic manifold $X$. The genus 0 GW invariants give the structure of quantum cohomology of $X$, which is then an example of a so-called Frobenius manifold. The mirror genus 0 B-model theory on the mirror manifold (or Landau-Ginzburg model) is usually described, mathematically, in terms of variation of Hodge structure data, or some generalization thereof. Since the higher genus A-model has a nice mathematical description as higher genus GW invariants, I am wondering whether the higher genus B-model has a nice mathematical description as well. Costello's paper on TCFTs and Calabi-Yau categories gives a partial answer to this. One can say that GW theory is the study of algebras over the (homology) operad of compactified (Deligne-Mumford) moduli space; I say that Costello gives a partial answer because he only gives an algebra over the operad of uncompactified moduli space. Though, according to Kontsevich (see Kontsevich-Soibelman "Notes on A-infinity..." and Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev), we can extend this to the operad of compactified moduli space given some assumptions (a version of Hodge-de Rham degeneration). There are also various results (e.g. Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev, Teleman/Givental) which say that the higher genus theory is uniquely determined by the genus 0 theory. But --- despite these sorts of results, I still have not seen any nice mathematical description of the higher genus B-model which "stands on its own", as the higher genus GW invariants do. I have only seen the higher genus B-model described as some structure which is obtained formally from genus 0 data, or, as in the situation of Costello's paper, a Calabi-Yau category, e.g. derived category of coherent sheaves of a Calabi-Yau manifold, matrix factorizations category of a Landau-Ginzburg model, etc. So, my questions are: 

Let $S$ be a closed surface and $F\subset S$ a finite subset. Then for each $f\in F$ there exists an open cylinder $Z_f\subset S\setminus F$ such that $S\setminus (\{f\}\cup Z_f)$ is compact. A complex structure on $S\setminus F$ extends over $f\in F$ if and only if the cylinder $Z_f$ has necessarily infinite conformal modulus. In other words it does not extend over $f$, if there is some cylinder $Z_f\subset S\setminus F$ of finite conformal modulus such that $S\setminus (\{f\} \cup Z_f)$ is compact. If $S\setminus F$ admits a conformal hyperbolic metric, a complex structure on $S\setminus F$ extends over $f$ if and only if the end of $S$ associated to $f$ has finite area (and is therefore a cusp). But as mentioned by seub, in the context you consider, the complex structure is (usually) assumed to be defined on the whole of $S$ (and the set $F$ may be viewed as marked points on $S$). If $S\setminus F$ admits a conformal hyperbolic metric, this is equivalent to the assumption that $S\setminus F$ has finite area and hence all ends are cusps/punctures. Fix a marking surface (a torus) $S_0$ together with $p_0\in S_0$ for $(T^2,p)$. The fact that the Teichmüller spaces of $T^2$ and $(T^2,p)$ can be identified follows from the bijectivity of the following forgetful map $\{\text{equivalence classes of markings of $(T^2,p)$ by } (S_0,p_0)\}\rightarrow\{ \text{equivalence classes of markings of $T^2$ by }S_0\}$ for suitable notions of 'equivalence' and 'markings' (which are slightly different on left and right hand side). To show both the injectivity and the surjectivity of this map one uses the key ingredient mentioned by seub. 

Question 2: Yes, there are conformal metrics on a divergent sequence of tori with Area=1 and bounded diameter: Cutting the torus open along an embedded essential curve, you obtain a cylinder, conformally equivalent to $[0,R] \times S^1$. The fact that the sequence of conformal structures diverges, means that we can choose the cutting curve such that $R_n\rightarrow \infty$. However this is not really relevant here and we just directly construct such a conformal metric for any such cylinder (which gives rise to a conformal metric on the torus). Note that any conformal metric on such a standard cylinder has the form $h|dz|^2$. If $R\leq 5$ choose just any function $1\leq h\leq 2$ which glues nicely back to a metric on the torus; up to rescaling we obtain conformal metric of area 1 and bounded diameter. If $R\geq 5$, choose $h\leq 2$ everywhere and $h\geq 1$ on a neighborhood $[0,1]\times S^1 \cup [R-1,R]\times S^1$ of the boundary (and such that it glues nicely) and arbitrary small away from the boundary, say $h=1/R^2$ on $[2,R-2]\times S^1$. Up to rescaling by a factor in $[1,10]$, we can ensure that the area is 1 and clearly the diameter is bounded. Question 3: The argument of Thomas Richard shows you can embed any cylinder of the form $[0,R)\times S^1$ for $R\in (0,\infty]$ into any torus. The cylinder $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ cannot be embedded into any compact Riemann surface $S\neq S^2$, since it would extend to an embedding of $S^2$. On the other hand, covering maps give immersions from $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ into any torus (but no such immersions exist into surfaces of hyperbolic type). If the embedding is supposed to be $\pi_1$-injective, then the maximal $R$ such that $(0,R)\times S^1$ embeds into a complex torus $(T^2,j)$ is determined by the length $l_j$ of the systole of the torus in the conformal class determined by $j$. Indeed one can see that the maximal $R$ satisfies $R=1/l_j^2$. 

I think it would be nice to have exhibits (or "labs" -- see Deane Yang's post) on various probability "paradoxes", such as the Monty Hall problem, the false positive paradox, the birthday paradox... Like the central limit theorem (see Sam Nead's post), many of these "paradoxes" can be experimentally demonstrated. The birthday paradox can be quite impressive when you have a group of around 30 to 40 people -- assuming it works out, that is ;-) The Monty Hall problem can also be demonstrated experimentally. Once, at a party with non-mathematicians, I played 20 instances of "the Monty Hall game", and already one could see that the "switch doors" strategy was usually more successful. Happily, my audience was actually rather unsatisfied with my experimental demonstration, and wanted a more conceptual explanation. (I actually found this to be somewhat curious -- for me personally at least, the experimental demonstration is very satisfying!) This lead into a long and fun discussion. I like the following quote by Israel Gelfand: 

What is the current status of these conjectures? Are there any cases where any of this is known to be true, or known to be false? Costello's paper states "I really don't know of much evidence" --- perhaps our state of knowledge is better by now? 

I don't know very much about this stuff, so I'm a bit afraid that I'm being naive or stupid, and I apologize if I am --- but it seems to me that Weil cohomology theories, or at least the standard examples thereof, are essentially, or are supposed to be, generalizations or algebraic versions of singular cohomology. If I am incorrect in this assessment, please do correct me. Meanwhile, we have other interesting cohomology theories in topology: for example (topological) K-theory, elliptic cohomology, complex cobordism, .... Correspondingly, then, are there notions of "K-Weil cohomology theory" or "elliptic Weil cohomology theory", etc.? Is it possible? 

Are people still using the second definition? If so, in which contexts, and why? What are the advantages of the second definition? 

I recently read the original paper by Chas-Sullivan on string topology, in which they introduce some operations on homology of free loopspace LM, where M is a compact oriented manifold, giving it the structure of a (Gerstenhaber-)Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. However, the arguments in this paper rely on some transversality assumptions, and I'm not sure whether these assumptions are justified. I know that the Chas-Sullivan operations have been constructed via homotopy theoretic methods by Cohen, Jones, Voronov (hopefully I'm not missing any names here), but I am wondering whether anybody has managed to construct the Chas-Sullivan operations in a way that more or less follows the original ideas (e.g. without using any homotopy theory).
