TLDR: Looking for Olympic sports where doubling, or halfing, someone's strength, size or toughness won't materially help or hurt them in that sport. They do exist. The alien spaceships spectacularly land on Earth. Everyone wonders what they are about until they say directly: they want to qualify their "countries" for the Olympics. "Oh. That's it?" Yeah, pretty much. Just one problem. Their strength, size or toughness are unlike humans - and they have wildly imbalanced some games - crying for separation as exist for men and women. 

No no, that's a terrible idea. Radiation shielding tends to become radioactive. When an atom is bombarded by radiation, it is often altered - neutrons flipped to protons, lose a neutron, gain one, etc. When it's just water, you're dealing with only 2 atoms - hydrogen and oxygen - you know what they do. You know how to deal with it. And water is pretty well-behaved, doesn't take much to clean up water in a light-water reactor. 

Follow the Galactica. But not all the way. It's going to veer off course to lead the Cylons away from Earth. Or give them the location Tell them 93 million miles from the sun, third rock, between Venus and Mars, and planar with most of the other planets in the system. They should find it in one loop. It will help a lot if you can give them the units of measure in kilometers. They should already know it because everyone uses the Metric system. That will spare you taking your shoes off to explain what a mile is. If it helps, a kilometer is 1/40,000 of Earth's circumference. If you find Mars, look for a functioning satellite and follow where the antennas are pointed. 

The key question is if each side knows about the other's bombs (or bomb program, same effect). If they believed they were alone, they would likely use it as we did - to best effort to end the war in their favor. This could result in a rude surprise if the other side did in fact have them. The more likely case is they would know. By developing a bomb, they'd learn to spot the subtle signs of a society developing a bomb. "Ah, we have this sprawling complex on Hokkaido which has very particular trucks going in and out (notably, not coal trucks) and very particular scientists... suddenly we realize what the sprawling complex at Hanford is." Knowing what to look for, they'd uncover a lot more stuff... for instance they would have already contemplated "where would the US test such a weapon?" and have spies already looking when the Trinity test went off. An hour later, a neutral intermediary delivers a message from the Japanese: "Welcome to the nuclear age." Once there is mutual realization (or presumption of same), fear of the weapon will send the diplomatic corps into overdrive. It's likely that both will drive for a consensus to not use the weapons in this war, and both sides would labor to add more and more conditions, and soon this would bust out into bona-fide negotiations which may end the war. Keep in mind, detonating a nuke on your own soil is fair play. If an enemy army is there, too bad, they're trespassing. (That is the real motivation behind North Korea's nukes; it forecloses any land-based invasion, securing their borders for good.) It would do the same for Japan, removing a land invasion from the table, which was a critical priority for the nation. A nuclear Imperial Japan would have been wisest to preserve their nukes for deterrent purposes, and make their intentions clear through diplomacy. Also fair game is safe, peaceful detonations on your own territory. The Soviets dug canals with nukes, and no nation considered that a provocation. Imagine if instead of fighting to the death over small islands like Iwo Jima, their garrison did controlled detonations to reshape or contaminate the island so it could not be used by the enemy (i.e. as an air base). 

Actually the army does care about the environment. Yes, they are "green". But even more, tactically, emissions give you away! Visible smoke has been a huge deal for centuries. The navy able to distribute clean-burning coal to its outposts got to sneak up on the other guys. Engines are dreadfully inefficient. The waste heat makes a huge heat signature for weapons to lock on. The futurists talk about swarmed weapons, but for decades there have been cluster bombs which will make short work of a tank division because each bomblet seeks out a tank's engine compartment. They only work on tanks with engines. They can't tell an electric tank from a pile of pipe (or a decoy tank). Identifying tanks visually (especially from decoys) is a much harder problem. Engines and turbines make a lot of noise. Whereas an electric drive is spooky quiet! That would allow them to "sneak" in ways currently infeasible. So yes, an electric tank is definitely a potential winner. Just beware the blunder of comparing an automobile's peak horsepower with an industrial engine's continuous horsepower. Recharge is easier than it sounds. You just need a small diesel APU (or hey, three of them for resiliency) such as the units made by Thermo King. This engine will be efficient and durable since it is optimized for one continuous load. A small fuel tank could be kept onboard, with larger fuel tanks mounted outside or in a trailer. The trailer could be dropped in combat. I'm not even sure I would bother with plug-in recharging, since that would motivate the enemy to destroy electricity infrastructure, which would hurt civilians. Solar panels which unfold and cover the tank would be awesome. The extra battery charging; masking heat emissions from APUs; and making decoys very effective. (the decoy could be a plain truck with the exact same solar array, charging itself and the tank too.) Tanks are not that fast, and they spend a lot of time idling while the combat engineers clear obstacles. A 200-mile tank charge would be one long, slow, miserable day. Armies have long had a problem with the tanks outrunning the support infrastructure. Several times in the North Africa campaign, tanks had to suspend a very successful advance, or allow the enemy to escape, because the fuel bowsers couldn't keep up. The efficiency of an electric drive would really help. 

Nuclear criticality You can have a pile (literally) of fissile material, with space amongst the material intended for a moderator, which will not have critical mass without that moderator present. This can even happen naturally. It is considered excellent reactor design to use a moderator which doesn't work unless it's reasonably cool. That is how most non-Russian non-Canadian reactors govern themselves. If core power exceeds demand, the water coolant will boil more, increasing steam voids (bubbles), which are a poor moderator compared to the liquid water the reactor is designed for. Power is passively reduced. We've barely scratched the surface on potential reactor designs. We have played with small modular reactors, which are factory-made and sealed, and not for the user to tamper with. Conceivably the transport instruction might be "keep the reactor hot enough for the coolant to be in gaseous state" otherwise it will go critical. Especially if tech is readily available that makes this easy. It's not the reactor You won't get a nuclear explosion from a runaway reactor. It might not even run away owing to the moderation method. But it would emit a heck of a lot of gamma radiation! (it would not be inside its massive biological shield; you wouldn't ship that, since it's plain concrete and easily made locally with indigenous materials.) Anyway, your other cargo might not appreciate massive doses of gamma radiation none too much, and that might be what explodes. And that is just the kind of dumb shipping mistakes that happen in the real world. 

You may be missing why flight didn't happen until the early 1900s. Flight happened when engines became energy-dense enough. That's what they were waiting for. If it could've been done with steam, it would've. That said, with refinements such as the steam turbine (over the reciprocating pistons) and better metallurgy in the boilers aimed at making them lightweight, it would be possible. You can't just scoop water from the ocean Anybody who thinks that has never fired a steam engine, nor managed water supply for one. Sheer availability of water is a huge factor, and the main limitation to operation of steam locomotives today. However water quality has a big impact on maintenance and longevity. Modern steam operators are very sensitive about their water quality. The engines that fueled from wells and local creeks also spent an awful lot of time in the shop getting cooled down and washed out. You'll have trouble doing that in the air, unless you have 4 boilers. (2 to fly, 1 to fail, and 1 in maintenance cycle). So if they're up in arms about well water with its ordindary mineralizaton, you can imagine where salt water would be. Fuggedaboutit! Boiler #2 would need service before you could get #1 cooled down, let alone washed out! You could purge the contaminant-heavy water before it condenses to solid, but then you would have to jettison large fractions of your hot water (after spending the energy heating it up!) Close the loop - recover spent steam Fortunately, aircraft have plenty of airflow. Given adequate metallurgy tech, you would be able to make your steam system a "closed loop", and recapture spent steam in condensers. Nuclear reactors already do this because the spent steam is contaminated. Gas plants also do it because polishing recovered water is cheaper than treating new water. (Polishing is a minimal treatment/filtering done to remove contaminants as they accumulate.) This would add weight and "wetted area" aerodynamically, but would solve the supply problem. Your system would need to be relatively leak-free, or it would have to be designed to leak into the condensers. You would not be able to carry a whole lot of makeup water. You could scoop it from lakes or gulp the ocean, but it would need better treatment equipment, and if the system leaked faster than the treatment plant could run, you passthrough under-treated water and accept the increasing scale and loss of efficiency, and hope you can make it to your destination or at least a diversion field. Carrying enough fuel isn't a problem An ultra-modern steam plant is nearly as efficient as an internal-combustion engine, so getting shaft horsepower from the fuel won't be the limiting factor. Really it will boil down (heh) to an efficient, elegant design optimized for the single purpose. 

Priced out Well, that was embarrassing. We were selling our wares in the trade district, and one of our younglings said "we're from New Hammersmith. In Londinium." The older gent replied "I've heard of a New Hammersmith, but it's nowhere near Londinium." Bless him, but the youngling is right. We thought we had located far enough away to avoid Mundanes (they love our products, just don't want to be near the loud and ugly machines which make them, nor our strange ways.) But in recent years, the city has sprawled in all directions. They endlessly complain as they commute to the city center on the railway we built, when they're not offering us insane sums for our housing! Development to our west would encircle us. We delayed that, but only by letting the City annex New Hammersmith next year. With City rules, City taxes, and allowing Mundanes to live in OUR town! Unthinkable! So we must move now. We will extend our railway west, while we still can, and use it to move our factories and our town. This time: far enough away. What are we leaving behind? The Mundanes would build Mundane luxury housing when we're gone, so we're building it. Get your deposit in! Doesn't really matter the reason why this colony is different and not compatible with the hardly-colonial Mundanes, the ones who hung back on Earth until Mars had city water, garbage collection, and nine Tim Horton's. There is that, plus a thousand other reasons in the history books. The colony ends up building a dual railway (as in the VLA, shipyards, or the N1 area at Baikonur), allowing them to move their very large modules. This dual railway, being nothing less/more than a standard double-track railway with unusually wide and precise spacing, becomes an extension of their original tramway to downtown Londinium. 

** Take 1 square inch, i.e. 1" by 1". Now imagine all the air in the atmosphere above that 1 square inch (mind you, that rectangle is more of a wedge, due to the curvature of the Earth.) All that air, all the way out, weighs 14.7 pounds if you live at sea level, somewhat less if you live higher. Hence, atmospheric pressure is 14.7 pounds per square inch -- literally. *** to be more precise a Pound, short for impoundment. 

"Go solid" on purpose If you read the Three Mile Island analysis (or The China Syndrome movie, very similar incident)... what spooked them was overfilling the reactor and causing the top part of the reactor to be water instead of steam. Why does that matter since a PWR type doesn't use steam in its primary loop? That steam bubble has the same purpose as the blue pressurizer tank in a house with a well - a volume of compressible gas to buffer changes in pressure, and avoid damage to piping and the reactor vessel. There's no "top" in zero-gee, so you can't rely on a steam bubble. Instead, you use that same style of pressure accumulator, and make your PWR "go solid". All the space in the reactor is occupied by liquid water. Why not make steam in the reactor vessel? BWRs do that, and they are a fine design. (China Syndrome was a bit confused about whether it was a BWR or PWR). Steam and water must be separated. The only way to do that in zero-gee is spin the reactor, which pushes the water out to the edge... The fuel rods need to be in water, making your core donut-shaped and a lot harder to achieve critical mass. So a BWR type is right out. Energy from hot water (or other coolant) Using steam power in a secondary loop (as in the PWR) is probably right out, same reasons as the BWR: you'd have to spin the steam generators and condensers. Also, the condensers would need to have an ultimate heat sink cooler than 100C, which may not be practical in space. Better to take the water to Peltier devices at the ultimate heatsink, and return the water to the reactor still quite hot. This is normal in a PWR primary loop. It is also cheap to pump, since you are only recirculating coolant at same pressure, not injecting 1-psi feedwater into a 1000 PSI boiler. Of course, you also have the problem that unlike terrestrial reactors, the environment is likely to freeze water which is not actively heated, ergo, no shutting down for maintenance. (Sort of like a Soviet Alfa sub whose sodium primary-loop coolant will freeze in the pipes). You may want a different coolant, that either shrinks when frozen and/or has a suitable freezing point. Most materials shrink when frozen, and the Alfa can be restarted in a shipyard facility. But water is really good Be careful in your choice not to lose water's best property - not its absolutely superb thermal density, but rather it being a good moderator in normal state, and a really terrible moderator in abnormal state. When a reactor makes excess heat, it makes steam bubbles which slow the reactor down - giving a useful "cruise control", and also passively shuts down fission if coolant is lost. This is such a desirable trait that I wanted to mention it. Chornobyl did not have this. Another desirable feature of a coolant is that it turns solid and congeals when it escapes into space, that way the ship is not lost and can recollect its coolant.) If you wonder why I'm keeping reactor design so "close to home", it's because experience matters. The Boeing Dreamliner was proposed as a flying wing. But they went with the conventional shape of the ME262 and 737 because it is so well understood. 

Aermotor has been making these things since 1888, and they're hardly the first manufacturer. I don't know how many folks have lived in rural areas, but 180' is not that deep for a well. You can also see the windmill atop the building catching nice wind, to say nothing of wind gradient effects which already slow wind near the ground. 

Deny them fuel. Leave them a planet in which all the easily accessible fossil fuel sources have already been depleted. No cheap fuel - no industrial revolution - no technology driven society - no space travel. Sure. Let's say they learn the secrets of the water pumping windmill, find electricity, develop hydro power, come up with an electrical grid, electric trains. But there is an inherent social consciousness about economy of energy - it is too precious to waste. As are metals, without unlimited fossil fuel to power mining and smelting. They'd love to use U-235 to achieve a critical mass and breed fissile fuels from abundant U-238 and Th-232. But the found uranium is much more depleted of U-235 than it ought to be, making this almost impossible. It would be a "slow society" - canals and electric trains. The personal automobile would be an absurdity. Now someone proposes to launch a single vehicle weighing 3000 metric tons - where every gram of that vehicle is made of an exotic metal or synthetic fuel that can only be made at staggering energy expense. Used once and destroyed! This would not correspond with the society's values.
