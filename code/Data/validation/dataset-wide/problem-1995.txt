There are three possible questions buried in your story. Was it wrong to tell her she might be fired? You already know it was. If someone trusts you with an upcoming management decision, it's not yours to share. You will certainly not be trusted with any other ones by this boss, for quite some time if not forever. But you're probably young and might be forgiven if you show you've learned your lesson. Could you be fired? Depending on where you work, you can be fired for any reason or no reason at all. The spelling "mom and pop" suggests the USA, and generally most places are at-will employment, meaning they don't need a reason. If having you around is worth it, they keep you, otherwise they let you go. Is it likely that someone who told me something confidential will fire me for sharing it? It's impossible to know, and hard to even guess, but I would guess no. After all, if she just quits (I have no idea why she would do so) then they don't have to give her severance and the like. It saves them the hassle of doing it. Therefore your actions are unlikely to hurt the restaurant, and since they are down a hostess, they may not want to get rid of anybody else right now. Your best bet is to go to your boss and communicate these facts: 

At least one Microsoft building has small rooms tucked into hallways for this purpose. They have soundproof doors, comfy chairs, a landline for you to make local calls, and power. I have used one for a longish call when I was working in a team room and it was perfect. It was not near the kitchen or the bathroom, so people were unlikely to be nearby, but the walls and door did a good job of keeping other sounds out anyway. Much better than a staircase, a break room, or taking up a whole meeting room. 

It's a pretty common policy, even in jurisdictions that explicitly forbid it. (Some employers, like some landlords, break the rules with a fair amount of confidence that they won't be taken to whatever board enforces them, or at least not often.) While I don't own a restaurant, I have a number of family members who have worked both front and back of house and say this is the policy where they work. (I have also seen retail cashiers held responsible for shortages in their tills even if the shortage was caused by a quick-change artist or a counterfeit bill. Again this may not be legal but it is nonetheless common.) There are two reasons for it. One is that it motivates the waiters, who are really the only ones who know the state of each table, to get payment from customers quickly and accurately. The second is that if a restaurant covered "skips", a waiter could encourage friends to skip or even accept a generous tip to "look the other way" while strangers skipped. Heck, they could even put an entire cash payment into their pocket and just say the people skipped. Are any of these likely to happen? Shouldn't a good manager be able to spot that sort of thing and fire the bad apples instead of forcing good people to pay for thieves? Sure, but many restaurants aren't managed well. You can even argue that knowing dine-and-dash comes out of the waiter's pocket, not the rich restaurant (ha!) will reduce the number of people who do it. As for whether it's acceptable, that is up to you. You can choose not to accept it by taking your employer to the labour board if it's forbidden where you live, which may work, but is likely to affect your relationship with your employer, or getting a job somewhere else. I doubt you can get your manager to change the policy based on you not liking it: it's not as though all the other waiters love this policy or the manager thinks it's what waitstaff want. 

in general the key to answering this well is the "why" part. If you just say "Candidate A" and then sit silent you have blown the question. (As an aside, I think it's a terrible question, but generally you can't share that opinion.) So if you say "Candidate A was clearly much slower than the others in my group, so I think that's my choice" or "Candidate A declared not knowing the tool we were using at all, so I think I would choose Candidate A" then you are showing your grasp of what is important for the job and your ability to judge the other candidates. It's possible some people will think "Candidate A is clearly strongest, I am going to choose Candidate A" -- I recommend strongly against that plan. Without good reasons for excluding Candidate A, you will not be revealing any of your strengths with such an answer. Another possible answer is "During the task I focused on getting it completed, not evaluating my team mates. My apologies, but I don't know any of them well enough to recommend elimination." This may count against you, but not as badly as being wildly wrong, such as suggesting the elimination of the strongest team member. 

If all of these are the name you go by, great. If not (eg you had a different last name when you earned that degree or worked at that employer) then in that part of your resume say (as Jane Doe). Introduce yourself, and use on your resume, the name you want to go by unless the large majority of your work-relevant paperwork is in the other name. Deal with tax, paycheque and plane ticket related issues after you are hired. It sounds like in your case it's the short name that you use everywhere. I wouldn't worry about it being your legal name. I put Kate on applications, contracts, credit cards etc even though my birth certificate has something else. When clients need to book plane tickets I tell them (or their travel agent) what name they need to use for that. As long as you are not trying to defraud you should be fine. A quick sentence in the cover letter that explains why you go by two names might be a good thing if many of your references or resume-related items (eg transcripts) are in the other name. 

When you choose not to explain a behaviour, you leave a gap where people will fill in whatever they like. Some people are generous and understanding, they say "perhaps Snowman has suffered a personal loss and is sad" so they cut you some slack and later you recover from your grief and things go back to normal. But some people are nervous and lack self confidence. "Snowman hates me!" they think to themselves. "No more laughing at my jokes, no more chit chat at lunch - I wonder what I did to upset Snowman?" And the team cohesion suffers. Your manager asked you about it and you minimized it. Instead of saying "I have suffered a profound personal loss and I'm sorry that it's lowering my energy, but I will recover from it in time" you said "I'm just having a bad time lately." Perhaps your manager thought "Snowman doesn't even like this job any more and is looking for a new one." In an org where only so many good reviews can be given, your manager may have chosen not to spend a good review on you. It's not right to tell you to suppress your feelings and your grief, but more importantly you probably can't. Since you consider this loss very personal and don't want to discuss it at work, you would have pretended to be happy if you could. But you couldn't. So you need to be more open with your manager. I don't mean describe your loss precisely. But "a profound personal loss" or "grief" are more precise than "bad time." As well, you can apologize for not being your usual self -- even though it's not your fault -- and that will make people feel better. You can accept the support your manager is trying to offer. Something like: 

Let me elaborate. Many people with Asperger's are not good at "soft skills" and don't pick them up naturally. They may even assert that such skills are not needed to be a developer and are irrelevant to being a good software engineer. Many hiring managers may disagree, especially for more senior jobs, and even when the job description doesn't mention any need to lead, manage, soothe, co-ordinate, or inspire. If this is the case for you, not getting the job may be because you are missing a required skill. You can choose either to gain the skill, or not to apply for such jobs. Another possibility is that you have the skill (it can be learned, but it's hard work, much like learning to walk after an injury) but you don't demonstrate it in the interviews. Some interviewers might see a lack of eye contact or weak chit-chat skills as "markers" for a lack of the ability to lead, manage, soothe, co-ordinate and inspire. If you in fact have these skills, you can work on how to show that in a job interview. This may involve telling people your diagnosis or it may not. Is it discrimination? If you say on your resume that you have this diagnosis, and a hiring manager says "those people have no soft skills" and doesn't even interview you, then yes, that's discrimination. If at the interview you are asked about leading, inspiring etc and can feel the mood cooling as you try to answer, then it is more likely that you are legitimately missing a skill or the ability to demonstrate that skill in the interview. Focusing on this rather than "they hate me for who I am" will improve your own satisfaction and could lead to a change in strategy that will improve your job search results as well.
