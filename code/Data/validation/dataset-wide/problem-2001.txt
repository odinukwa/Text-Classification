Consider asking if they could do something during lunch if your commute is a problem. I've worked with some people who did not drink, so we made it a point to ask them out for lunch which typically didn't involve alcohol. Also, coming home late is going to happen in many work situations, so consider picking one day a year and possibly stay at a hotel. You could do it at the beginning of the year or when a new person gets hired so people will remember you are willing to go out once in awhile. You'll probably be one of the last to leave and who knows, you're boss may be so pleased with your willingness to pay money to hang-out, you may get to expense it. 

Finding top talent is difficult, so I think more companies must go out of their way to attract, hire and retain them. Even if you don't keep this candidate, you're developing a reputation as a company that sincerely cares about employees. You never know, this candidate may know someone else to fill your position.Don't be penny-wise and pound foolish. 

Hire people that want to help people. Maybe someone who enjoyed working in customer service, but wants to get into a technical field. You don't want someone who was a waiter/waitress and hated it because customers were rude. All things being equal, get someone who can write and type fast. There will be a lot of email and chat support, but they need to be professional. They won't get away with most of the 'styles' they use with their friends. If you think you can take someone who wants to be a future developer, you may be able to have them do support for a very short period of time. They will get bored and frustrated quickly, but may stick it out for a future position doing what they really want. This could also be true for someone wanting to get into sales. 

You don't know if this is the final offer. They're not sure. You may not be dealing with the person who has the final say. You just never know. 10% is not that far off. They know your situation and are willing to offer you another interview, they shouldn't accuse you of wasting their time since they didn't give a definitive answer on the final offer. Just claim you were hoping they could increase the offer. 

Consider documenting your schedule along with due dates/times for different tasks. Make sure you communicate those due dates with the people responsible/waiting for it to be completed. This could be a simple email. There are no guarantees they will follow-up or even hold you accountable, but I tend to have more expectations for myself when others know about my plans and would be embarrassed to miss these deadlines regardless of their expectations. Avoid being too specific. No one wants 10 emails regarding the intermediate steps to a larger task. The goal is not to put an additional burden on anyone else. This could be a daily or even a weekly summary of things you need to get done. Because of the time restrictions and management philosophy of this professor, I don't think any formal process or additional input on his part is going to happen. Your other colleague may resent this request and see it as having to baby-sit. You don't want that, so try something less formal. Just keep them in the loop. 

He'll never know you don't like it until you tell him. It is a bit confrontational, but this is what it is going to come to. Maybe you can have a casual discussion in some off time like first thing in the morning. These things are better discussed when you're not in the heat of the moment. If you don't want someone sitting over your shoulder while you work, don't start working until they leave. You shouldn't be forced to suffer because of his issues. Set a time for him to come and review if you think it will benefit. If he comes before then, stop working and don't let him see your work. You make an agreement; he should stick to it. Continue to stretch these out over longer periods of time. @MeatyPotatos has a good strategy to just let him make changes. It doesn't appear you have any control of what he does with your work afterwards. However, you need to have this discussion with your supervisor as well. You don't want him to think you aren't doing your part. Hopefully he'll understand. 

Another part of the equation is whether or not your time at work is directly related to profit. Billable Hour Example: If your total cost is 50 (generic currency) / hour and you take off 2 hour per day, you think reducing your income by 100 will cover everything. What if you are billed to customers at 100 / hour and bring in an extra 200 / day? Maybe the company can find other people to cover, but if not, the company needs the 100 savings by reducing your salary plus another 100: part for profit and part to cover other expenses (rent, support staff, support services, etc.). Productivity: Not all hours of the day are created equal. Is it possible to work fewer hours but almost accomplish just as much? There are local laws that may prevent you from skipping lunch or other breaks. Showing you can still get your work completed is what concerns management the most. Other options/arguements Flex-Time: is there a way you can start sooner and have someone else be responsible for the child in the morning and you cover in the afternoon. Work from home: Are there any tasks you could do away from the office? Even if you're just checking email, reviewing documents or other work, training/study. Position isn't really full-time: Many employers offer full-time hours because they think all employees will want to make that much money, but there really isn't enough work to fill the whole day. They may think they'll grow and then more work will be there, but in the mean time, why not save the company some money. You may have to dig into your duties and have your manager get rid of some of the unnecessary tasks. Other Benefits: By being with your child more often you can address minor illnesses before they get worse and force you to take several days off of work. Some people lose productivity if they have to deal with home problems from the office anyway. This is a fact of life and any employer that thinks parents never think about their kids on the job is just fooling themselves. Burn-out should be a concern for everyone who employs programmers on anyone else with a stressful position. 

During an interview anyone can fake being nice and show they really care for an hour. What you want is people who have this disposition so being courteous comes naturally. When you need people to have other traits (In this case technical skill), the herd gets thin. You may be putting too much emphasis on the technical side. Hiring people with less technical ability is going to put a bigger burden on your training program. Look for people with experience in customer service like waiters and waitresses, but make sure they actually enjoyed the job. Ask what they liked and disliked. You'd rather they complain about their feet hurting rather than having to deal with problem customers. 

You should prepare yourself to negotiate, but first, get some clarification and see if the discrepancy is due to a lack of communication and whether or not it can be corrected. They may just fix it. Also, if they give you whatever reason why they can't/won't, be prepared to negotiate. That starts with determining the minimum salary you will accept before contacting anyone. If you want the higher salary, stand firm. Let them know that is what was the agreed amount. Usually when there is some sort of mistake, people honor the original agreement. I've had one situation where someone indicated a firm salary amount during the interview, but offered a lower salary. Let's just say accepting that job was a learning experience I wish I could have obtained in an easier way. 

This isn't a case of a subordinate going over your head; this is an office politics power move. I'm going to put my answer in the context of you being a C-Level manager and the higher expectations that come with it. 

If you don't want any rumors being created, then tell as many people as possible. People may want to know where to find you. There's not much you can do about other people's involvement in why you're being relocated. Hopefully, you could have a conversation with your boss and ask if there are any circumstances about this move. Tell him you were on a different lunch schedule and others may have assumed you were slacking off. Make sure you get some clear parameters about when you need to be at your desk. Moving you without any warning about a potential attendance problem/concern doesn't seem right. Just make sure you have things worked out with your boss. What everyone else thinks is secondary. 

There seems to be a Catch-22 here based on getting paid or not and whether you get to do any meaningful work. I'm not sure what is worse: getting paid to learn nothing or actually doing and learning something for free. Everybody assumes you're being exploited because you're doing work for free. Unfortunately, there are too many internships where there isn't any real work being done at all by the interns. That doesn't mean you can't learn anything, but too often there isn't anyone there who can take the time to supervise. Let's face it, they don't have the money to pay you, they don't have the money to pay people to attend to you either. The most important piece may be whether or not you can get a quality reference from the people at this company based on your experience. They may allow you to contact a previous intern to see if it was worth it or not. 

You may need to get permission to take more of a leadership role. You can't put your responsibilities on hold because you're getting more training. If you're being paid as an experienced professional developer, you have to be able to work a full-time job and do training together. Otherwise, take a position as a junior developer and ignore my recommendations because you won't have any authority. Nobody is perfect but it doesn't seem like your development team is using what many consider best practices like having: 

Take control over some of their expectations know that in some way they will always want everything yesterday. A lot of this is communication. Use the tools you have available: email, project software, voice mail, etc. Here are some things to consider: 

Look at it another way. What has your company and/or supervisor done, to give you any indication they think you are working hard? 

You need to bill for this discussion time since it is not typical and will be very lengthy. Often, gather enough requirements to do a quote is not directly billed/itemized, but ends up in the over-all fee eventually. Everything is negotiable. The client needs to be aware that this will slow the project down and take up your time which you do not intend to do for free. If it takes too much of your time (Maybe you have another project) you can decline to do the code review or the entire project. My guess is this client wants to play it safe and make sure they understand the code in case you leave, start charging too much, fail to complete the project, etc. 

In an office environment I wouldn't go to these extremes in the physical space, but mainly in the virtual spaces: 

Building software can be the same for a full-time job, as well as, a part-time job with a non-profit (Linux development has been mainly non-profit and those key-contributors can write their own ticket for job placement.). The main factor is the extent of the project. For example: did you work for a non-profit on a web site with a lot of traffic. Were you working with large data sets? You have to be able to connect the skills utilized in your non-working projects with what the jobs require. If you can't, you may want to look into additional work to expand on your previous experience. Also, the people at the non-profit should be giving you a very strong reference. 

If you're more comfortable, just come up with a typical annual increase and apply it over two years to your current salary. You don't seem to be worried with asking to little/leaving money on the table. The idea is for you to "think" about this process just like at the university. However, I don't know about Germany, but in the US, professors do have to justify their performance. Of course, they have more objective criteria like number of publications, committees, thesis chaired and student ratings (not that the student's themselves are objective, but the ratings are fairly cut and dry.). Being able to defend and value the level and quality of work you do will also help you if you ever want a promotion or to get another job. 

I do not recommend offering this information in an exit interview. An unsolicited negative evaluation of employees will not benefit you in most cases. A new manager should be evaluating everyone and getting feedback. In an exit interview, the manager could ask you for advice on the level needed for your replacement. Suggest they hire someone at least as skilled and experienced as you. Be objective and honest if asked if your coworker is capable of managing a junior developer. The manager should be looking for ways of knowing what clients think of their employees. It's a shame more teams are not given the responsibility of evaluating each other to help improve the team as a whole and not compare one employee to another because that invites backstabbing. Ultimately, it is up to the manager to build a quality team. It's not your fault if he doesn't ask for your help. Like you suggest, don't burn the bridge. Personally, even if you told your manager, he won't be able to utilize it and find the appropriate replacement. 

If the boards on the windows can be removed and something that is easier to take on and off is an option, ask if you can get some light for a few hours a day. I prefer working in the dark, but my dog likes to look out the window occasionally to make sure there are no squirrels in the yard, we compromise. You can always go somewhere for breaks and lunch where there is sunlight. What is it about your team that you don't feel you can ask for a simple request? 

If you feel a strong need to be on Twitter, then make an effort to set aside time; whatever works best. Being focus on a project is a huge advantage and I would be careful not to lose the spark. It can be hard to get back. Maybe an alternative is to focus on the project, but make plans afterwards for some extended time off. I'm sure your Twitter fans won't mind. 

As an employer, my response would be, "No Sh*t." Does anyone really want a job making less and being required to do more than humanly possible? Focus on the job and not your life's work. You like the salary. There's nothing wrong with that. Tell them it's in your salary range. The job requirements seem like something you can handle. It could be too much or too little, but why bother disclosing that? You're willing to do the work relative to what you're being paid, that's good enough. You may see this approach as the non-bullsh*t answer, but it's really just the obvious one with nothing extra added to make someone want to hire you. 

Startup Benefits: I'm not going to list them because you just get a certain vibe from working at a startup. Since they don't have all the levels of management, no one has the time to micro manage you as much. You should be closer to the decision maker(s) and be able to make more of a direct connection between your efforts and the company's success. You can get lost in a large company, so you need to be able to cut through the fog and complexity and figure-out what you're doing there. This can be tough when company policies just seem to come down from the mountain. I've found if I like my direct supervisor and this person has some influence within the company, you can make it work no matter what. 

Whatever you do, get all this in writing. As a last resort, I wouldn't be working very hard if you feel like this person is not going to pay you for work. You may want to consider not working at all. Of course, you could get fired (which is what you want), but there is a reputation and a risk of not getting a good recommendation from your boss and possibly your coworkers. If they're willing to keep working, they may resent you slacking off and making this recovery even harder. 

You should indicate that you gave a salary figure contingent on other benefits being similar. Now you know that is not the case. Be open and honest about the discrepancies in the healthcare costs. I don't know if you were under the impression you would be able to work from home. The company may not be aware of the advantages of this and could use you as a test subject. This could be an area for negotiation. There could be a lot of training or "getting up to speed" on things, so early on, they want you in the office. You could set an intro period, but that in order to do this continuously, you need additional salary to make up for the expenses this is going to create. Disclosing the reason for childcare is up to you. The general goal is not to take a pay cut which would be the case with this offer. This seems like a reasonable request, but there could be some flexible solutions as well.
