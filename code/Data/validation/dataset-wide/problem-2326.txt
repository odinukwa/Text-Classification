Those are functionally identical to "official" outdoor meals, but at a fraction of the price, and I think the taste is quite good. They're my stock food when in the outdoors. I'm usually hiking or cycling, but of course one can eat them with car camping as well. Note that they're marketed as for two people, but I think that'd be two very small meals. After a day hiking, one such bag is a perfect quantity for me. (I do not work for Knorr, but they happen to have the largest selection of this kind of product, as far as I'm aware) 

On my hiking trips, I mostly sleep in my tent, but occasionally I appreciate to have a roof. Mostly by chance, I've found on my trips a number of free and open huts in Norway that are not owned by Den Norske Turistforening (DNT) (the Norwegian Tourist Association). They tend to be far away from where most people hike. I've never seen one occupied and browsing through guestbooks usually reveals an occupation of less than 20 nights per year. They're marked on the map, but from the map it's not possible to tell the difference between private and locked cabins (hunting and fishing associations have quite a few of these), available to the public at a fee (usually by fetching the key in the nearest village in advance), or unlocked and free to use. Some free-to-use ones that I've discovered, all by chance, are: 

Owens Valley and Sierra Nevada, 2 June 2006, still shows considerably snow. Source: Wikimedia Commons, G. Thomas. Perhaps the Inyo Mountains or the White Mountains are more suitable? I found a quite nice map overlaying snow conditions and trails on the same map. With an account, it also provides access to historical data, so one can obtain a map for 10 May 2012 (login required), like this: 

At the end of this month, I will be spending some days in Kraków, Poland. I might have a half or a full day available and apart from exploring the city, I'd like to do some hiking in the close surroundings. It will be only a short hike: one day at most, probably just a few hours. Can anyone recommend a nice destination for a half-day hike close to Kraków? I will be dependent on public transportation. 

The Tromsø region does not lack woodlands. If you go out into Bardu into spectacular Dividalen National Park, there are plenty of woodlands. However, mountain birch forests in winter are nothing like dense forests in Poland or other midlatitude regions. The trees are 3–7 metre high and lots of light passes through, so in most forests your opportunities for aurora viewing are fine. Both in Dividalen and on Senja there are free and open cabins that are deep in the woods (the one in Dividalen will be at least two days walking/skiing, though, and can be tricky to find; I've read some reports of people concluding it didn't exist!). Yes, you can light a fire. Open fires are prohibited below the treeline between 15 April and 15 September. In February you're fine. Bring your own firewood or collect dead wood from the ground. Do not cut off branches from living trees. In February it may be difficult to tell dead from living trees, so do not cut off any branches at all. I've hitchhiked in Norway and I've found it works quite well, but I would recommend to try buses as well. The road closest to some of those cabins may be a rural road with little traffic, so it may be a couple of hours before you get picked up. You might be better off roadwalking from the nearest bus stop. There is no reservation system. For people arriving the same day, it's first come first served. If you've already stayed one or more nights, the group who has stayed the largest number of nights should leave to make place for the newly arrived group. This is even more true if you can sleep in a tent. 

Måskåsj-gammen. Photo by Oddmund Andersen. Source: krigsminner blog The blog says it is "roughly 6 km into Sweden", which in the local landscape is not precise enough to find it, in particular since there is apparently no trail leading there. I don't think it would be possible to find on Google Earth. There is a map in this document about the history of WW II refugees but the scale is far too poor to locate the spot in the landscape. What are the geographic coordinates for Måskåsj-gammen, or where is it relative to locations as written on the official topographic map (regardless of the correctness of the names on them)? 

I would recommend going to Los Padres National Forest including the Ventana Wilderness in the Santa Lucia Range. No chance of snow there as even the highest mountain does not exceed 1800 metre and most time will be spent at lower elevations. And if you head to summits near the coast you have great views of the Big Sur. You will probably need a car to get to the trailhead. I've hiked along the Big Sur around Christmas time and it was very beautiful and pleasantly warm. You will not need any winter gear¹. Yosemite is too high, you will need snowshoes to hike there in April. You can also do great hiking in Death Valley or elsewhere in the deserts of Southern California but that is much farther from San Francisco, and much drier. There's certainly coastal areas north of San Francisco as well but I haven't been there so can't comment on those. 

I'm currently planning my autumn (August/September) trek somewhere in Canadian mountains. Canada is vast and there are many very spectacular places, but some are very popular; for example, Jasper National Park gets some 2 million visitors per year, and even backcountry camping is limited to campsites and need reservations. This means there is neither solitude nor flexibility, so I will look for a less popular location. I've been considering Kluane national park, Mealy mountains national park, Tatsenshini-Alsek provincial park, Northern Rocky Mountains provincial park, Tombstone territorial park, and others. I suspect the number of visitors for those parks ranges from less than a hundred to hundreds of thousands per year, but I'm only guessing. When off-trail hiking is possible and permitted, the probability of solitude naturally increases dramatically. For U.S. national parks, visitor statistics are available online. For Canadian national parks too. Total visits for BC provincial parks top 20 million. But is there anywhere where per-park visitors for provincial and territorial parks in Canada are estimated? 

Damaged bridge, OK for careful crossing. If it looks like you won't survive if the bridge won't survive, don't cross when in doubt. But for most bridges, you will survive a damaged bridge. 

I've only once experienced a nights' sleep that my sleeping bag didn't handle. I was only 200 metre from civilisation, and I hardly slept, but it was not really dangerous. I'd expected temperatures around 0°C, but it turned out to be the local coldest night of the year at -7°C. 

Hnappadalsá, Lónsöræfi, Iceland, 20 September 2015, afternoon. One common advice is to wait for the morning, when the river might contain less water. As far as I'm aware, this is based on the (reasonable) expectation nights are colder, there is less melting, and therefore less water. However, this river is not glacier-fed: there are only tiny icefields upstream, there was hardly any snow left, and it was a cool autumn day. I didn't have the patience to wait for 16 hours, I crossed and survived, but it was quite scary and it certainly wasn't wise of me to cross¹. Most of the water in the river was not meltwater. Is it still useful to wait for the morning? 

I would recommend to put the kayak on the roof, and put the bicycles on a rear bicycle rack. It should work if you have at most two bicycles. 

Moon House, Bears Ears National Monument Within Bears Ears National Monument, the Moon House ruins are limited for day visits, with apparently up to 36 permits per day issued. Permits are available through BLM. 

I've read that in the United States, national forests, ranger offices, etc. often have some safety-related equipment for rent, such as bear canisters. Do they rent out Personal Locator Beacons, satellite phones, or similar equipment that can be used to call for help in the wild? 

So, if your ways ever pass through southern New Mexico (and why wouldn't they?), feel free to fill your backpack with small rocks at Rock Hound State Park. 

This is a function of latitude and season. Apart from that, it depends on local landscape, weather, and your own eyes. On a rainy day in a dense forest, it may already be quite dark at sunset. On a clear day on a treeless plain, there's still plenty of daylight at sunset for most people, even though it's a lot darker than at midday. Civil twilight is defined as the period between sunrise and when it gets too dark to do everyday outside activities. That typically corresponds to the Sun being around 6° below the horizon. Depending on latitude, that may be as short as 20 minutes (equator) or as long as several weeks (poles). Near the Arctic Circle around the equinoxes, it tends to be around an hour. You said you preferred not to use sunset tables, but it really is the best way to go. I tend to use the US Navy calculator. For your question, you only need to pay attention to the difference between sunset and "end of civil twilight". In an open area, that is a good proxy for the period during which you won't need artificial light for outdoor activities. When the weather is very poor and you're in a forest or deep valley, you'll need to reduce this period a bit. 

Similar principles apply when travelling in a hot desert, although then the primary danger is dehydration rather than freezing to death. In hot deserts I tend to have about 20 litre of water per person in the car (which should be enough to survive a week). 

The easiest is to take the routes that many people take, because on those routes, social trails have formed and you may find help if you are in trouble. 5–7 days is too short. Although you can get through quickly if you take take the route from Tjåmotis into Aktse and you might make it to Akkastugorna in 5 days, I would not recommend it. You should take extra days in case of delays, and if you are not late, you can use those extra days for detours or day trips. However, if you mean you have 7 days to get from Aktse to Kisuris (for example), you should be OK. Kungsleden (the mountain "highway" full of cabins and trails so well maintained they remind of North American National Parks) leads through the far southeastern corner of the park, from Saltoluokta via Aktse to Kvikkjokk. At Aktse, you can take a boat to a point under Nammásj. From here, there is a reasonably good trail all the way to Skarja and Kutjaure at the tri-park-point with Stora Sjöfallet and Padjelanta. Although this trail is not an official trail and contains some laborious stretches, in particular through Rapaselet, it is nowhere difficult by Sarek standards, and at times actually has wooden planks laid out through wet areas. However, you will still need a tent and you will still need to ford streams. There are no navigational challenges. This route is popular and if you hike it in summer, you will meet plenty of other people, probably several groups every day. That makes it easier as well, because you will not need to bring equipment such as a satellite phone: in summer on the trail you are certain to meet other people who may be of assistance in case of an emergency (by warning authorities as soon as they reach civilisation). However, I recommend autumn as the birch forest may be full of mosquitoes in summer. I hiked this route in September 2013, and it's very, very beautiful, in particular the view from Skierffe above Aktse. We met people three times in total. If you do one thing in Sarek, hike to Skierffe — you can do it as a day trip from Aktse. You can also hike from Skierffe down to Rapadalen (we did this in 2013) but that requires more off-trail navigation including through the woods. If you seriously only have 5–7 days, you won't make it far into Sarek. Use Aktse as a base and hike into the park 1–2 days, then turn around to where you came from. You won't have time to cross Sarek through Aktse if you start at Kvikkjokk or Saltoluokta. 

In late September 2015, I hiked part of the trail in the incredibly beautiful Lónsöræfi in southwestern Iceland, near Vatnajökull. The easternmost segment of the trail requires fording Hnappadalsá (Satellite/aerial view). Some people by-pass this section by driving a nearby mountain road (which skips a very spectacular part of the trail, and doesn't look any less scary!). Still, Hnappadalsá contained rather a lot of water: 

In Iceland, off-roading is strictly prohibited. Unfortunately, it still happens and one can find tracks of off-roading all over the central highlands. On the other hand, in the landscape, some roads that are mapped on Atlaskort do not look like much more than some tracks in the landscape either, and may have neither an F-number nor a sign where they depart from larger roads. Under these circumstances, how would I tell a road from a place where several cars have illegally off-roaded before? Must a road have an F-number to be permissible for driving? If I have a (possibly old) map that shows a road somewhere, and I subsequently see that road in the landscape, does that mean driving there is fine, or is there some more official source stating what exactly are the roads that are officially recognised? 

Quote: A total of £130 and because of the damage to the leather the boot will leak so in my opinion its just not worth repairing them 

Whiteout at Barros Vermelhos. Snowshoes might have helped here, but it was passable without. More photos from the hike, including the period before and after I reached any snow, in the full album on Flickr. 

I have some experience with these two guidebooks, so I know what I can do. There's no trail mentioned in the Swedish guidebook (På Fjälltur) that I would avoid on a backpacking trip, but for many of the trails from the Norwegian book, I would. Subjectively, on a 1-to-1 mapping, I would map any trails from the Swedish book rated 1–7 to be rated 1 in the Norwegian book, Swedish trails 8–10 rated 2 or 3 in the Norwegian book, with the Swedish book not containing anything rated 4 in the Norwegian one. Some routes are even described in both books. This is just an example, but for me, it clearly illustrates that there is no universal set of guidelines. It depends very much on the standard and who one keeps in mind. It seems Norwegian kids are born on a a slope and they go mountain hiking in kindergarten on trails where 20-year old men from other countries would be scared. A Dutch hiking book may consider a route "difficult" because it's 20 km (even if all is paved and of course flat). So, no. There is no official grading or agreed upon set of attributes. 

This dry bag comes with a valve and compression straps. I understand the purpose of the compression bag, but what is the purpose of a valve? 

Svartakvísl, central Iceland. Nowhere to hide. No building within 24 hour walking. No caves. I might be able to reach a canyon, but I have no clue if that's a safe place to hide. Perhaps it will funnel the wind, or perhaps the wind may be associated with flash floods or landslides. What can I do to be OK? Is this a moment to call for emergency helicopter rescue (obviously BEFORE the storm hits)? NB: I have read What is a good tarp setup for very high winds above the tree line?, but that question talks about 25 m/s winds. I might consider sheltering in a very good and very well-pitched tent in 25 m/s wind gusts. Not so when wind gusts may be up to 50 m/s. I am not confident the answers there are wise for winds such as presently occurring in Iceland.
