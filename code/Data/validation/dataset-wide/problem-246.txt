The larger the body of water, the more stable the ecosystem. For example, when you are designing a fish tank, the smaller ones are much harder to maintain, because their chemistry can get unbalanced very quickly. The larger the tank, the slower the changes, giving you more time to correct and balance your nitrate & ammonia cycles. If you think of a star ship as a giant fish tank for people, you might want to build a live support system an order of magnitude bigger than you think you really need, so that it could house the plants for your nitrate & ammonia cycles, all your fish for food and still be drinkable. It would also give you some wiggle room if your heating-cooling system has to go offline for some reason. It could store/absorb a lot of extra heat in a pinch. 

I would say that part of the question would be whether you could freeze individuals in or filled with some sort of non-expanding liquid. If the lungs and major cavities are supported, brittleness ought not to be a factor, just the actual strength of the tissues and the surrounding material. As an explanation - your hypothetical traveler is frozen in their acceleration couch. It's suspended from a shock absorber (magnetic field, liquid, or mechanical) which prevents sudden, very high-G events (impacts) from shattering them. However, sustained G-force acts as a compressing force, pushing the body up against whichever surface is orthoganal to the direction of acceleration and "behind" the traveler. If their lungs, as the largest empty cavity in the body, are filled with (chilly) air, and the force applied is sufficient to substantially reduce their volume, the question would be whether their brittle flesh is then sufficient to withstand the force of compression - which is the second part of your question. If, however, the lungs were flooded with a biologically-inert liquid, itself frozen along with the traveler, then the force isn't applied to the structure of the body, but just to the individual tissues, and the concern is the tissues' crush strengths, rather than their strength as structural components. In that situation, while I couldn't give you an actual figure without knowledge of the properties of frozen flesh I do not have, I would imagine you could exceed normal acceleration tolerances substantially, since most of the normal problems associated with high-G have to do with blood moving about the body, or bad things happening to the vitreous humours of the eye or compression of the brain. The problem would be finding a fluid with which you could flood the body's easily-accessible cavities that wouldn't have negative effects a) when doing the flooding, and b) when defrosting your traveler. 

Yes. Rather than use a hoop, you can use a second train. Every time they pass each other in orbit, they push off each other, creating a more elongated orbit. You wouldn't go straight from Earth to another system, though. You'd build up velocity around the earth to travel to the sun, then you would repeat the process using the sun's vastly superior gravity, as well as a convenient fusion reactor - allowing you to build up a much, much higher velocity. You aim both ships towards your target system, and they set out together. When they get to the target system, they use its sun to slow down again; orbiting around it and using each other to break. Then make the final trip to the destination planet when they are going slowly enough to be captured in orbit. And that's how you get across space without any propellant. Plz send my nobel prize in the mail. The length of the trains wouldn't matter - your maximum speed is governed by the escape velocities of the 4 orbiting bodies - Earth, Sol, target sun & target planet, although a longer one would need fewer orbits to accelerate without pasting the monkeys. There would also be a lot of planets that would be mathematically impossible to get to. 

The Short Answer No. In the realm of scientific realism, there are no chemicals that are simultaneously so sensitive to light that it would trigger an exothermic reaction strong enough to burn a "person" to "death", while stable enough that they could otherwise be carried about by that person. The Longer Answer On the other hand, you already have zombies. Assuming they're actual "dead former people now walking and doing things", your scientific credibility is already in sharp decline. So if it's something you really want as a characteristic of your zombies, you could make it happen. Let's say that your Z-parasite, your microorganism/parasite/magic that makes the zombies, was originally created to organically generate binary fuel for something. It keeps that fuel in the space formerly reserved for its victim's brain, separated by a (for an equally contrived reason) extremely photosensitive but otherwise impermeable membrane. Expose the holes in that "zombie's" head to light, the membrane degrades, a bit of the fuel components touch one another, and whoosh. 

For the purpose of your story, make it whatever you like. Perhaps aliens abducted all the people on cape cod and used them to start a colony - now that colony is 25% gay. 

Water currents - eh. Air currents, absolutely. Manipulating air temperature also manipulates air pressure: aka wind. A constant warmer + lower pressure zone of air would keep the sails full. 

I don't think you could ever bring enough cargo to support the colonists. At sub-light speeds, the only viable way to feed your passengers is a self-contained ecosystem. What cargo you do carry would be a small amount of emergency food, hard to make engine parts and backup seeds & embryos in case you have an ecological disaster mid-flight. 

With enough money, anything is possible, but no, I don't think we could slow-boat by 2200. It just isn't enough time to figure out how to live in space. In your model, we have been cruising around Sol for 170 years. Any trip to a neighboring system would take longer - perhaps a lot longer, depending on where the next habitable planet is. There are just so many things that could go wrong - problems we don't even think to anticipate. The hard part, in my opinion, is the ecology of a colony ship: Creating an ecosystem capable of safely supporting a human community for hundreds of years without any outside input. Can it be done? Absolutely. Would I step onto one of these ecosystems unless they were already a proven technology, perfected in orbit around Sol? Hell no! Then what do you do when you get there? We have never colonized another planet before. We need to be prepared for it to go wrong, or even to walk away from the planet and come back to Sol. 

As a different option, what about ultra-long-haul submarines? Nuclear submarines' propulsion is effectively unlimited (at least within the lifetime of the submarine), but they are limited by their ship's stores. So if you had several decks devoted to hydro/aquaponics to supplement what could be harvested from the ocean, you could have a submarine that could potentially operate for years without a resupply, and on which the operators could continue to eat healthy meals. This would, by necessity, need a lot more space, and would be more like a roving habitat than a battleship. 

You could probably get a little better yield-per-mass from your nuclear weapons with boosted fission designs, but I stuck with pure fission weapons because that's what they were working with in 1966 when they were designing Orion. Just because nukes were off the table didn't mean that rocketry scientists weren't up to trying everything; if a conventional-explosive bomb-driven rocket were actually in any way more efficient or cheaper, you can bet that they'd already have them in action. They aren't... so they aren't. Pursuant to #2, I recommend giving Ignition! by John D. Clark a read. When I say rocket scientists (and rocket chemists in particular) were up to trying everything, I mean everything. It was nuts. And it's a great read! 

It did survive. There are Catholics in the UK. The protestant/catholic fighting was regional and cultural as much as it was religious. Polygamous societies cannot compete with monogamous ones. Poly societies under-utilize their male workforce, since so many of them fight/exploit each other for a chance to reproduce. They always end up with a horde of angry, virgin men, and you can't always dump them onto the EU, if you know what I mean. There were a great many criticisms of Catholicism. At its core, the mysticism - conducting religion in a language that your flock cannot understand, was the big complaint. The Church of England is very similar to Catholicism in terms of ideas. They broke away so that they could stop taking orders from the Vatican, and so that they could study the bible in their native tongue. If the European aristocracy had gone poly, it would have hastened the revolutions that killed off so many of them, and no way would it have delayed the enlightenment. 

If you're talking about species capable of stellar manipulation, the "science-based" tag is probably a misnomer, because we're talking about technology so sophisticated it's tantamount to magic. That being said, if we're obeying the laws of physics... Stellar Siphon The best way to accelerate the progression from red, through blue, to white, is to exhaust the remaining hydrogen from the star. One way you could do that was employed on Stargate ("you blow up one star...") - you create a link through something like a wormhole to a black hole (or bring a portable one), and use that to drain the hydrogen before it even starts fusing. You'd probably get some wheat with the chaff if you were draining material from the dwarf, but it would speed things along, and there's likely to still be a lot of degenerate matter left. alternately... Fusion Accelerator This one presumes the ability to manipulate gravity (might be impossible in our universe, so "science-based" is iffy). Intensify the gravity of the red dwarf, increasing the rate at which hydrogen fuses. It'd get a lot brighter in the short term, but the old adage about the candle that burns twice as bright applies here. This might present a problem in stage two... Stellar Heat-Sink White dwarfs aren't still fusing. Their luminescence is entirely due to residual thermal energy. So the solution is to cool down the star. Simple! The problem is that you can't make a body in a vacuum radiate thermal energy faster than it's already doing so - there's a bunch of work on that topic. So you either have to build a megastructure that can be in direct contact with the star's surface and presents a larger radiative surface (problematic), or find some other way of cooling things down. Enter... She Blinded Me With (Cryo)Science So this one requires an enormous energy budget, but laser cooling might be your go-to. It's been done to objects as large as a gram. So it's just a matter of scaling it up. A lot. And having a large sink for the heat transfer. You would likely need nearly as much mass as you intended to cool to act as the sink. Given the enormous amount of energy and effort required, unless there's a really good reason to speed things along - or unless your civilization has a source of energy that makes stars seem trivial - it might just be better to wait. 

They have until the queen bees starve to death. Then the world ends. If the bees can't fly, they cant collect nectar. No nectar means no honey. No honey, no bees. No bees, no pollination. No pollination, no plants. no plants no food, no food, no people. The druids would probably notice the bees' suffering very quickly, and hives would have some stores of food, so you'd still have time to save them. More generally, people would notice right away. It would be pretty weird to see a flock of starlings running across a road. "Hey Bill, why did the pigeon cross the road?" "Goddamit Adam, I already know that his is going to be one stupid joke. Hurry up and have kids so you can torture them with your lame dad-jokes." "No, bill. That bird over there. It's walking across the road." "holy crap, you're right Adam. What the hell?" 

Partially yes, though doing it today would probably be hard. The problems here are threefold: No male gamete donors This may not be a problem. Viable bi-maternal embryos have been created in a variety of species at this point. The fact that both the gametes would be coming from the same parent is another problem, namely... Genetic Bottleneck Parthenogenesis doesn't tend to work for sexed creatures, even when artificially induced, because of imprinting locations in our genetic sequences. We're big into recombination, because it gives us additional avenues for beneficial mutation and recombination, without reinforcing negative traits. Potentially, you could use CRISPR to modify the genes in one of the manipulated gametes or eggs to increase heterozygosity. This is strictly experimental right now, though, and would be unlikely to produce viable offspring in this "one chance or you'll miss it" preservation of the species unless a desperate effort were made. Cloning potentially buys you some time here. Artificial Womb This is probably wholly unnecessary. While a Thylacine is part of a largely-extinct family, as long as its reproductive characteristics are sufficiently close to an extant mammal, a surrogacy could probably be maintained. Summary So, if this were to happen today, the species would probably be done for, though genetic samples could be preserved for cloning/recombination at a later date. We're very close, however, technologically, to being able to recover the species from a single specimen. The one caveat - no male specimens, until and unless we figure out how to manufacture a Y-chromosome from whole cloth. We could potentially find a close relative and do some substantial genetic engineering on its gametes, but that is not something we're close to being able to do right now.
