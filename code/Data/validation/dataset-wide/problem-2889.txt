Very simply put: no, it is not wrong to name such a theory "the theory of everything" provided that everything is defined materially, as you have suggested. Such a theory will be capable of unifying all branches of physical science the way that chemistry and biology are unified today. However, if there are "things" that are not material, then YES: it's wrong to call that the theory of everything. Are integers "things"? Obligations? Neighbors? 

* Footnote: As Christian author David Powlison wrote in "Good & Angry", your forgiveness of somebody else between you and God is always required. But it is not always required, possible, or even safe(!) to restore a relationship directly with a person, which is the other kind of forgiveness. Somebody named Rick Thomas wrote about this distinction, naming the two types "Attitudinal Forgiveness" and "Transactional Forgiveness". 

To Christians, Jesus is God. Therefore, any proof of Jesus' historical presence and/or his true nature could serve to prove the existence of God. However, a person's freedom not to believe is acknowledged by Christian teaching. Therefore, it seems necessary that all-powerful God not provide proof of his existence, or else He would not provide people this freedom. Christian person William Lane Craig acknowledges that this is a problem and identifies rather than proof, "warrant" as something possessed by a believer in addition to his own faith that God exists. For a discussion of "warrant", please see here. Craig did not originate this idea: it was written earlier by Alvin Plantinga in, among other things, his book entitled "Warranted Christian Belief". 

Well, a lot of people think that science can resolve the problem of being sure. The nice thing about science (as taught by Karl Popper) is that whenever it's sure of something, that thing is repeatable. That makes science neutral with regards to different philosophical viewpoints. But the aching problem with science is that it doesn't have that kind of certainty about what's unrepeatable, like origins, or fundamentally invisible, like morality. Rene Descartes wrote, "I think therefore I am." Rather than being a congratulation of self, this statement is meant to find some hard floor in reasoning, something that really can't be negated. And "well, at least I know that I am thinking right now" was a pretty good shot. But that won't tell you how to run a government. I think an acceptable next step for Descartes would have been to say, "Other people are just like me." From there one could identify equality and justice, which are pretty stable values throughout time. Your Question ...is a very good one! Here's an example supporting your argument: 

A realist would say the properties are real. Plato was a realist. A nominalist would say that the properties are not real, however much they appear in speech and thinking. Another stance opposed to realism is anti-realism, as enunciated by Michael Dummett. Back to your question: how would this debate play out over commodity prices? On the face of it, seemingly a realist would believe that the price---a consensual monetary value applied to a lump of wheat or lead or empty cattle wagons---is a real object that truly exists; this real object can be causally related to other objects. Seemingly a nominalist would concede that the price is there on paper, but it is not itself real: it is the name people give to the dollar value of some future economic transaction; it has no causal connection to anything in and of itself. I suppose that today we would find realism to be a bit of a strange theory. With realism, there exists some real standard of "big", "green", "best", etc. against which every thing may be measured objectively. Where would this standard exist? What is its origin? Realists would need to tangle with all of these objections.

I think that some people would prefer if antireductionism was a scientific position. Then they could account for irreducible things without denying materialism. Others (including Stephen Jay Gould and his "non-overlapping magesteria" and Karl Popper) are perfectly happy to think that science is reductionistic, because they acknowledge the irreducible things to be true but not known to science. People who have problems with science and reduction are those who idealize science as reductionistic and also assert that science is the only reliable source of truth claims. BTW: I changed the claim in Wikipedia to be less broad... now it reads "Antireductionism is the position in science and metaphysics that stands in contrast to reductionism (anti-holism) by advocating that..." Clearly, antireductionism is a position in science one can take on interpreting a dataset or experimental result. But now Wikipedia is not asserting that science is antireductionistic. 

Together with Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig identifies belief in God as "properly basic", like the belief that "I have a head" or "I left the keys in the dresser." He does not go on to say that any properly basic belief is therefore true and indefeasible. Maybe you changed your routine and left the keys on the kitchen table! But there is greater warrant for the belief that "I have a head" than the belief that "I left the keys in the dresser", since it would be harder to defeat. 

Are moral obligations real? For examples of moral obligations, I raise politics: to hold elections that allow voters to determine a change in government authority seems to be a moral obligation for democracies. Likewise, large powerful countries, having committed not to do so at a place like the UN, seem to possess a moral obligation not to invade their weaker neighbors in order to take their stuff, ports, and natural resources. 

I agree completely with your notion of a paradox. A paradox is an impossible conclusion from combining two ideas and it shows us that one or more of the two ideas can't be true. Another way of putting it: a paradox is a syllogism in which the first two premises seem acceptable, but the third statement reveals an absurdity. Knowing a paradox means knowing that one or more of the first two premises are incorrect in some real way. Let's put my analysis against the first four Google-search paradoxes. 

Are you sure that cryonics works? I wasn't aware of any examples of a cryopreserved person who regained consciousness. For what it's worth, here is a quote from Christian person J.P. Moreland on this subject: 

Thanks to Conifold for providing a great answer. I would like to emphasize that "here is one hand" is an important defeater to a number of sentences which you may hear uttered from time to time by folks who don't see a problem with denying reality. I think that "here is one hand" is probably more rhetorically powerful than the approach I have considered, but never employed, when a person tries to convince me that nothing actually exists: "If I punch you in the face, then will I exist? What if I punch you again?" 

Some of your students may be familiar with the classic theological problem of "if God knows the future, then how can my will be free?" For them this argument about "Newcomb's Paradox", which makes use of counterfactuals, may prove helpful. 

The relevant question of absolute morality is actually not addressed in this proverb! Instead, we get "do people despise you for your theft?" and also, "how will you be treated by the authorities?" Do we despise lions who eat antelope? I would say, "no". I would say we don't even despise them if they harm people, but we would absolutely defend ourselves--- including shooting one that was in the middle of harming a person. Proverbs 6:30-31 appears in a ten-verse sequence regarding adultery, in which an adulterer may or may not be despised for his actions, but will most certainly be gunned-down (or otherwise challenged) by the husband whom he offended. Reasonably, this sequence is telling us that Biblical morality is just not a matter of absolutes, but of relationships. Does the action you took harm your relationship with another person, not excluding third parties? If yes, then it was an evil action. I always note that Jesus said that "no one is good but God alone", and "be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect." He also generally called everybody "evil". Morality is good for us to know, but impossible for us to attain. 

I see that death implies life, in that anything that's dead was alive before. I don't suppose that life implies death, because who knows? Maybe you will be frozen in a black hole time sink and never actually die by virtue of getting stuck in a moment forever! Also, classical notions of God/god imply that he/she/He/etc is eternal, meaning never dying. So at least one life doesn't imply death, classically. 

Change of social role or change of person? None of a person's memories, plans, intentions, history, friendships, and family relationships will necessarily be other than they were before the transition, indicating that the person is the same person before and after the transition. The person is the same person in spite of the fact that the relationships may get different names ("sister" instead of "brother", etc) at the same time as the person who has transitioned gets a different name and/or gendered pronoun and takes a different role in society. Persons change their roles in society every day without becoming other persons. Marriage, emigration, legal issues, hiring and promotion, parenthood, etc. all change, but you still (for example) owe Frank $15 for lunch last week, and you still go to opening day baseball every year with Mary and your dad. Add to this list gender wherever transition or "passing" is a possibility. Relationships: social role vs. friendship Social role is constructed and may change, but friendship is personal. Friendship doesn't become different by virtue of gender transition or any other social change. Some aspects of a relationship may change without altering friendship, just like aspects of personal identity (including age) change. Here's a philosophical definition for "friendship": 

I won't attempt to analyze this problem here, except to say that there is by no means agreement by scholars that choosing to throw the switch is unethical. Your question seems touched by both "stand your ground" cases and "trolley problem" cases, because the dead person wasn't by any means intending to be a threat to you. I think one applicable ethical theory is the Golden Rule: 

In American constitutional law, not being killed unjustly is a right that is acknowledged in the Declaration of Independence and laid out specifically by the Due Process Clauses that appear in the 5th and 14th Amendment: 

I think that the presence in our language of the word "natural" implies that there is something other than what is natural. In the same way, the words "artificial", "impossible", "unnatural", "fake", "processed", "hideous", "man-made", "false", "personal", "uncanny", "irrational", and "manufactured"---- each of which is "not natural", would be meaningless if there were no such thing as "that which is not natural". So by observation, I believe that making an all-inclusive definition for natural that would include the iPhone can't be correct. Otherwise, this whole body of well-used distinctions would turn out to be truly vain. 

I'll suggest the Euthyphro Dilemma by Plato as an example of this issue. In my thinking, Plato used the Euthyphro Dilemma to bring to light a problem with believing that gods are actually just human expressions rather than true-in-fact supernatural authorities. The dilemma (as reworked by Leibniz) goes: 

If a friend of yours is talking about suicide, he or she is begging for help from you already: a person intent on suicide wouldn't be talking about it at all. But similar to a child's temper tantrum, talking about suicide is a relational power play that will wear out friends fast. The suicidial person needs parents or professionals, not listening ears. 

This exact situation was navigated by none other than Jesus. The last time he entered Jerusalem, the Pharisees were trying to locate Jesus so that they could let kangaroo justice run its course and get him killed. They enlisted the help of the Romans, who governed the city, making finding Jesus a government imperative, which Judas obeyed. Yet there are few who regard Judas' actions in providing the governors this bit of intelligence as the right thing to do. Soon thereafter, Jesus was being interrogated in court by Pontius Pilate and also Herod, where he exercised his right to remain silent. Unlike with Judas, I can't think of anybody who says he was doing something wrong by remaining silent under this questioning. The relevant Commandment (of the ten) is "do not bear false witness". I think people who are troubled by these paradoxes overlook the word "bear". By not speaking, Jesus doesn't incur the burden of proof or shirk his obligation to tell the truth. From this paper written about Kant's position on the matter, we read that according to Kant, 

Something is subjective when it is caused by a person. "The chicken tikka masala is too spicy" would be a subjective statement because it is either true or false depending on the person saying it. Something is vague when there is no sensible boundary such that its extent is known exactly. "Too spicy" is vague because there is no way that the transition between "too spicy" and "not too spicy" occurs at an exact place. Vague concepts are the subject of the "sorites paradox" (or "paradox of the heap"), in which you remove grains from a heap of sand until what's left is "not a heap". We learn that although "heap" is a meaningful concept, it is vague; it's a good thing that there's nothing important that comes of being "a heap"! (I sure wouldn't want to order "a heap" of Cheerios on Amazon... I might get two Cheerios in a bag) I think that "This food is too spicy" is subjective and definite... I won't eat it, but perhaps somebody else will. Also, "This is a heap of sand" is objective and vague. Cheers! 

Meaning in life is generally received from some higher authority or external reference, as with the notions of "worth," "purpose," "value," etc. Thus a wolf living wild may gain meaning in its life by becoming tamed by a person. You might say that the success of an ecosystem makes the life of its members meaningful. Anything higher than a person can function to provide meaning. All the ideals of good, of progress, of success, or of power (and many others) are commonly used this way. Although many people refrain from doing so, many other people look for meaning in supernaturally-sourced writings or direct revelation, to find what higher beings think their life's meaning is. Nearly all religions maintain recordings of supernatural revelation. Because texts cannot communicate directly to animals, humans must act as mediators for supernatural writings to provide animals meaning. If animals were to receive revelation directly from supernatural beings, we would not know because they can not communicate that with us; we would not know if they had meaning or not.
