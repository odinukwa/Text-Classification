I think the best kind of squat to work up to a single-leg squats is assisted single-leg squats. I used rings at hip height, which I held on to as lightly as possible. At first I rested a lot of weight (and balance!) on the rings. Eventually I was only using a finger or two on each ring for balance at the very bottom, and soon after that, I didn't need assistance from the rings at all. That will help you develop the necessary balance and mobility, and will help somewhat in terms of strength. However, I firmly believe that barbells are king for developing the raw strength (particularly in the lower body) that it sounds like you still need. I think any barbell squat will help. Front squats are closest to the pistol movement, but I would rely on back squats (low or high) to provide more load. (If you're already doing assisted pistols, they would provide the "similar to the task" movement, obviating the need for front squats.) The only aspect of this that you're overthinking is the planning and waiting. I'd start doing assisted pistols ASAP, alongside your back squat programming. I wouldn't wait until you get to some arbitrary back squat number. Three to five single-leg squats dispersed throughout the day, and after your workout, shouldn't interfere with your strength progress. 

First of all, the accuracy of 1RM calculators is never going to be exact. A 1RM is inherently unpredictable. To my knowledge they are not rigorously tested against different pseudo-rest periods between reps in a set. I sometimes take several breaths between reps of a squat. The bar is still on my shoulders, though, so it's still a set. In a high-rep context (for which 1RM calculators already become inaccurate) like towards the end of a heavy 20-rep squat workout, I might take five or six fast breaths. In a deadlift, it's normal to take a breath or two and reset one's grip between reps and still call it a set. An average of 9 seconds between reps for a 10-rep set is pretty far into territory that I would consider not a set in the normal sense. But the distinction is extremely vague, especially for exercises where you're still holding the bar. For a deadlift, where those pauses between reps are complete rest, I'd say they firmly don't count as a set and are more like a cluster of singles. 

We get a lot of this type of question: "we know X, but can we scientifically prove X?" The answer, almost invariably in the field of strength training, is no. Science is dead; long live science There's an enormous number of variables in strength training: nutrition, hormones, time of year, mood, prior training, genetics, exercise selection, proper form, proper coaching, degree of coaching, rest, program interruptions, mobility...the list goes on. I have yet to see more than a handful of studies that control adequately for even a few of these. (To get an idea of some of these problems, see 2011 in Strength Training (PDF), a strength-science literature review by someone affiliated with Mark Rippetoe, who authored Starting Strength, which is very similar to StrongLifts.) Another massive problem with any scientific evidence regarding strength training is the problem of the novice effect. To wit: if someone's been sitting on a couch for ten years, getting them to do any exercise at all will produce immediate and dramatic changes. From this fact springs a million advertising claims. So a dozen untrained grandmothers can improve their eyebrow-muscle endurance by using a calf raise machine eight times a day while eating nothing but graham crackers. Great. But what would have happened if they had done squats, deadlifts and chin-ups? Or marathon training? Or if they did squats, did they do them correctly? According to which standard? (And why do we care about eyebrow-muscle endurance, anyway?) This kind of science, where variables are controlled and compared in a useful manner, is apparently hard to produce. "Science" in sports, bodybuilding, fitness, and strength training is almost always of the N=1 variety. That is to say, people experiment on themselves. (Or the people they coach, making N>1, but N is still too heterogeneous to make it peer reviewable.) Kurtis Frank has an excellent observation on this point: 

The Real Fix All these lifts look generally fine because they're so light. You're able to do the lifts quickly and gloss over any technique errors or weaknesses. The solution is clear: keep adding weight. Lifting is good. Lifting heavy is way better. The best thing you could do for your form is to steadily add weight to the bar and modify your expectations. Get ready for it to get a lot harder. 

I nix the second set at 45 pounds, but do full sets of five for all my warm-ups. With deadlifts I take bigger jumps: 145x5, 215x5, 285x5, then my work set at 340x5. Building up gradually is a great way to avoid injury. There's a limit to how much you can omit before you start rolling the dice. I'm not a big believer in the lasting efficacy of a half-hour Starting Strength workout. 

Chalk was a dramatic shift in my deadlifting. Not having the bar slip out of my hands from sweat was a game-changer with no discernable downside. I got a block at a rock-climbing store for a buck fifty and it's lasted me over a year with frequent use. Keep it in a bowl so you can capture the dust and fragments to use later. I also recommend using an overhand grip for all warm-up sets, then switching to a hook grip for the work set (or sets). Since the overhand grip is weak, you will be requiring and and creating grip strength on all your warm-up sets (particularly the last). Using the hook grip when it's really heavy gives you a major grip strength boost. This will prevent your grip from getting in the way of big weights, or distracting you from proper form. This double-overhand/hook-grip combination should prevent your grip from hampering your deadlift until you are lifting approximately double what you are now, or more. Grip-Specific Work I'd recommend against straps or grip-specific work unless they become absolutely necessary, and even then I philosophically prefer exercises that have other benefits over grip-strength-specific work. For instance, pull-ups, particularly on a rope, fat bar, or other hard-to-grip setup are great for your grip and also improve a whole lot of other strengths. Farmer's walks are another great, fun, productive way to work your grip while also improving posture, conditioning, and muscles across the trunk and legs. I'd do these before resorting to grippers. 

Thomas Kurz, author of Science of Sport Training, recommends something very similar to your warm-up. The order is different, which might make a significant difference despite being a small tweak:L 

(Page 82, Practical Programming) I am not a bodybuilder, but I imagine it would be reasonable to have longer rest periods for those exercises where you're focusing more on strength than hypertrophy. You might not have any exercises where that is true, but it's worth considering strength work even in a hypertrophy program. In those cases it would still be good to keep the rest periods short--say, three minutes. If you can't complete your later sets, then I would lower the weight, reduce the number of sets, or accept a longer rest period until you're better adapted to your current program. 

Forty minutes of gym time is an unrealistically low expectation if one is looking for the same effects as a multi-exercise program. If 40 minutes is a hard cap--which I'd advise against having--then first I'd only do one work set. Warm up with the bar, add weight in logical big-plate increments (e.g. 20kg, then 40kg, then 60kg, then 80kg, then 100kg), then do a single maximal set (e.g. 115kg x5 reps). This eliminates nearly a majority of rest time since there is no rest time between warm-ups and after the work set you can immediately strip the plates and move to your next exercise. That's probably not enough to get a workout down to 40 minutes. Remember, 40 minutes is a ludicrously short period of time to expect to complete a whole-body strength workout. At this point you need to start dropping exercises. Forget chin-ups, at least. Thirdly, switch to a 3-day split so you can do fewer exercises per day. For instance: 

I don't retract my shoulderblades fully, but engage pretty forcefully the muscles that retract the scapulae in most major exercises: front squat, back squat, deadlift, overhead press, pull-ups, and so on. If you're rounding your upper back forward during any of those then something is weak and wrong. 

I would start the Couch to 5k program with the shoes you have now. After a week or two, you'll be familiar enough with the shoes to evaluate whether you need new ones. You might be fine just using these for the entire program, but there's a concern that you'll dislike using the same shoes for running as for normal use. They'll get smelly. But for now, just wear what you have. 

There are "strength standards" charts (such as this one for the squat) that one can use to get an idea of the rough weights that this usually occurs at, but Rippetoe and others have deprecated them as misleading. (They were never meant to guide individual progress or programming changes.) You are right to focus on factors other than the weight being lifted. Demarcating The Novice/Intermediate Line Greg hit the nail squarely on the head in terms of the bare-bones, technical definition. That's the one you should use. Phrased another way: 

It is false that 30 minutes of constant work is necessary to improve conditioning. It is a myth based on steady-state cardio training only, and is only true in some cases even when training in that modality. For instance, it may take a significant amount of time (circa an hour!) for an experienced long-distance runner to start challenging their conditioning in a low-intensity steady-state run. However, less experienced runners may take far less, and that long-distance runner could challenge their (general) cardio by doing shorter, faster sprints. Even very short high-intensity efforts (e.g. 4 minutes) have proven to be highly effective for improving conditioning. Ross is closer to the truth. He is advocating for 20 minute high-intensity, high-density efforts with built-in rests in order to challenge all the metabolic pathways. 

If I were deadlifting and overhead pressing as my main exercises, the first things I'd look to for assistance would be pull-ups, dips, or power cleans. The pull-ups help the upper back for OHP, the dips help the triceps and shoulders for OHP, and the power cleans train speed and explosiveness for the deadlift. 

Don't. The issue is not "weak abs" but that you haven't been properly engaging your abs during squats. Heavy squats, unlike light squats, require a locked trunk, which requires abdominal engagement. This doesn't mean you need to do ab-specific work. It means you need to set up your squats correctly. Additional ab work can be OK, or it can distract. I suspect that in your situation it will distract. Stick to a program, don't veer off into assistance exercises, and focus on getting strong in the core lifts: squat, deadlift, overhead press, two or so more. 

Your family's concern is misplaced. Deadlifting 80kg is perfectly reasonable, as is deadlifting 100kg, 120kg, or 160kg. What's dangerous with lifting weights isn't the amount lifted, but whether you're advancing carefully with additional weight, being judicious with one-rep-max attempts, warming up sufficiently, managing minor injuries, and acting preemptively on mobility and inflamed joints. What, then, will convince your family of this? It's impossible to know. Are they convinced by evidence? Show them injury rates compared across sports, which shows weightlifting to be extremely safe. Are they convinced by reading regular women who lift? Show them a quick blog post. Might they be convinced by seeing women lift competitively, to broaden their conception of women's capabulities? Show them, say, Julia Rhode. 

You have made solid progress. Congratulations, keep up the hard work. If I were you I'd switch to a program that adds weight weekly or monthly, such as Rippetoe & Kilgore's Texas Method from Practical Programming, or 5/3/1, or another similar program. That will keep you adding strength for quite a while longer. I'd consider switching up exercises, to gain the benefits of variety: mobility, strength in different areas, injury and burnout prevention. For instance, switch one or two days a week from back squats to front squats, or switch entirely to front squats for eight weeks. The same goes for deadlifts (try RDLs, snatch-grip deadlifts, etc.), pressing (vary bench, overhead, dumbbell/barbell, maybe throw in some Turkish get-ups) and so on. Be careful not to add to much weight too soon on new lifts, even if they're very similar. If you get antsy working with temporarily lighter weights, keep at least one heavy workout a week using the lift you're more experienced with. I'd do one short cardio finisher for one to all workouts in a given week. Ross Enamait has some great material for metabolic conditioning, including his Magic 50 (5 rounds with 1 minute rest: 5 dumbbell snatches per arm, then 5 dumbbell swings per arm, then 10 burpees). I'm also partial to Glenn Pendlay's conditioning recommendations, which tend towards heavy kettlebell work for 5 to 10 minutes. Or, just run and do sprints. 

This hits the same major movements: squatting in the recovery of the clean, pressing (overhead), "deadlifting" in the clean, and pulling in the chin-ups. I'd say that such a program would be plenty for a basic level of strength. To get to fitness, I'd add a little running (say, half a mile or less, as fast as possible) or other form of cardio, or do the clean-and-presses as a complex. Address any mobility or flexibility issues that arise from the workout program as described. That's it. Strength, conditioning, mobility. Barbell Training Resources: the best introduction to barbell strength training I've yet read is Rippetoe & Kilgore's Starting Strength (book, unaffiliated and mostly-correct wiki summary). Minimal Equipment (But Not Bodyweight-Only) If getting a barbell and squat rack seems too costly, but you want the rapid return-on-investment that external loads provide for resistance exercise, I'd buy one kettlebell, as heavy as you can safely handle. This should be between twenty-five and fifty pounds for untrained adult men and women. That plus a pull-up bar or gymnastic rings allows for tremendous external resistance (though not as much as with barbells). With this kettlebell-plus-pull-up-apparatus setup, one could do pull-ups, goblet squats, kettlebell-style swings, clean, and snatches, as well as overhead presses, Turkish get-ups, and with some practice, single-leg (pistol) squats, eventually with the kettlebell. That's a heck of a lot of strength and conditioning potential. The bare essentials of that list would be some form of squat (goblet or pistol), plus some form of press (overhead, or a Turkish get-up), plus either swings, cleans, or snatches. They can be combined with rests for maximal strength or as a complex for strength and conditioning.
