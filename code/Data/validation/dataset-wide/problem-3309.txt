You are probably reading James Allen's "Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs", 3rd Edition, 2014, because both in the 1st Edition (2000) and in the 2nd one (2010) he has those signs this way: 

The Yoruba language has a rather elaborate vigesimal (base-20) numeral system that involves both addition and subtraction and multiplication. There are words for each of the decades; units in 1–4 are created by adding to these, while units in 5–9 are created by subtracting from the next decade. The odd decades are created by subtracting ten from the next even decade: 

The words with W reflect the Norman French pronunciation, those words were borrowed into English early, from the Norman French language. The words with G are from Parisian French, those words were borrowed into English later. 

It is definitely a question of trust, unless you are an author of etymological dictionaries yourself. Your language has lots of words, and you need to know the etymologes of some of them, so for each of those words you start to "grow" their history in your mind, their earlier forms, more earlier forms, and so on back in time up to the earlieast proto-forms of them you can learn of. This is a part of learning your own language, although it will definitely give you some knowledge of the languages that came into contact with yours. Everybody comes through this (in this or that form), you should not be concerned about that, it is never late to learn, and you can never learn too much. ;) 

There is a Facebook group Linguistic Coincidences & Curiosities the members of which have been collecting such false cognates for years already. My favourites are the Latin and Malaysian "dua" which means "two" in both languages, there are also "reverse" coincidences like in Polish "tak" means "yes", and in Indonesian it means "no". 

I wonder why your Hebrew-speaking friends couldn't identify the language and the text which is one of the most often quoted pieces, the prophecy of the comming of the Messiah, it took me 5 minutes to do that, although I don't know Hebrew. 

Russian has this feature, too: этот больной человек 'this sick person' vs. этот человек болен 'this person is sick'. 

The idea of finite/infinite verb forms is definitely irrelevant for Malay since the Malay verbs have no forms at all. As for English, if a verb form can be a predicate and it can be the only verb form inside the clause, then it is a finite verb form. 

Ukrainian has some nouns like that: листя - leaves (collective) листок - a leaf насіння - seeds (collective) насінина - a seed бадилля - the tops foliage (collective) бадилина - a single stem or a leaf of a plant 

Actually, there is no inconsistency in the two Wikipedia articles you gave the links to. The vowels [ɑ], [ŭə], [ŏə], and [ĕə] are written with the help of a special diacritic sign called bântăk (a small vertical line written over the final consonant of a syllable, ់). 

In the Southern hemisphere moderate climate zone the colder season is also called 'winter', but the winter months are June, July and August, since all the countries that use the Gregorian calendar have the same month at a given time. 

Yes, it's English written in Tolkien's Tengwar, and the text is written with lots of mistakes and discrepancies, still it's obvious it is intended to be read as: 

I think, the names in the other languages like Greek or Arabic that have their meaning in those languages are standardized, for example 'Abdullah' meaning 'God's Servant' was and is given to millions of people, while the Native American names are unique and individual, they are given to just one person each. 

The source of that chart is not Russian, but Ukrainian, it is K. Тищенко. Метатеорія мовознавства, 2000. As you can see, it's available online as a site, but it obviously lacks many illustration pictures. Professor Kostyantyn Tyshchenko is the author of more than 180 publications on different languages and on various branches of linguistics, so, taking into account the inaccuracy of the data about the source of the chart on the site you gave your first link to, one can suppose that the chart can actually be from some other publication by Tyshchenko. 

That is very language-specific and works well for English, but not for many other languages. E.g. Russian can have an adverbial phrase following a copula, and many languages (like German) don't distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, moreover, many languages (like most of the Altaic languages) have neither adjectives nor adverbs. 

Turkish is a typical head-final language which means that nouns, which are the heads of noun phrases (NP) and verbs which are the heads of verb phrases (VP) always come at the end of those phrases. Because of this, the adjectives always come before the nouns they are attributes of, like in "güzel ev", this is an NP, "(a) beautiful house", an adjective + a noun, it cannot function as a sentence. As for "ev güzel", "(The) house is beautiful, this is a VP, here "güzel" is a verbal adjective "is beautiful", the predicate of the VP, which in Turkish inflects for person, number and tense. This VP can function as a valid sentence, here "güzel" is a 3rd person singular present tense verbal adjective. The 3rd person present tense suffix -tır/-tir/-dır/-dir/-tur/-tür/-dur/-dür can be omitted in such verbal adjective, still it is easily reconstructed, because here the adjective follows the noun, it cannot be an attribute. 

1) "Young" in your sentence will be in the nominative case agreeing with the nominative case of "man", but both "friend" and "dog" will be in the accusative, which excludes "young" modifying "friend" or "dog", since only adjectives in the accusative can modify them in your sentence. Actually, the free word order in those languages that allow it, functions within a clause or a predicative word-group and words from one clause or group aren't inserted into another one. Don't overact as for how free the word order can be, language is needed to make others understand what you say, the free word order only helps it by highlighting this or that part of the sentence, the speakers are absolutely aware of the situations when the sentence can become ambiguous and they avoid that. Consider the sentence "My neighbour is my friend" (Vicinus meus est amicus meus), in Latin all the nouns and possessive pronouns in it are nominative masculine. What's the use of messing it up by putting the words, say, this way: "*My my is friend neighbour" (Meus meus est amicus vicinus)? Can you think of at least a single reason somebody would say it that way? 

Both nouns and adjectives are called 'nominal parts of speech', from Latin nomen 'noun', the Latin for 'adjective' being 'nomen adiectivum'. I guess that can be the source of the Etymonline confusion. Actually, participles partake of verbs and adjectives, while infinitives and gerunds partake of verbs and nouns. 

We imagine the time flowing at us from our front to our back, so the future is in front of us and the past is behind us, for us the time flows from the future into the past. I don't know about all the languages, but for those who speak Aymara, a South American language, it is all vice versa, for them the time flows from behind, from the past and into the future, so the future is behind and the past is in front of them. In other words, we look into the future, they look into the past. And as far as I know, there are no prepositions in Aymara, spacial relations are expressed by noun cases. Articles about this: One. With the Future Behind Them: Convergent Evidence From Aymara Language and Gesture in the Crosslinguistic Comparison of Spatial Construals of Time Two. Reversing the Direction of Time: Does the Visibility of Spatial Representations of Time Shape Temporal Focus? 

The easiest way to solve your problem is to create your own keyboard layout (it applies if you use MS Windows, or just google the phrase for other platforms). You can use Latvian keyboard layout as a base, it already has š and vowel letters with macrons (like ā and ū). You'll only have to define the keys for the letters with the under-dot, like ṭ, and for ḫ. 

The Medieval (Latinised) Futhark had 25 letters. The Gothic alphabet had 27 letters, but two of them had no phonetic value and were never used to write any words, they were used only as numbers. Every Gothic letter had a numeric value, that is why 27 letters were needed — 9 units, 9 tens, and 9 hundreds, 9×3=27. Still, only 25 of them were used to write words of the Gothic language.
