Searle isn't suggesting that he can't learn to understand Chinese. He's asserting that, just because a computer can answer questions like a human, does not mean that the computer understands language. In his thought experiment, he's just like a computer when it comes to Chinese because he doesn't understand it. You shouldn't get hung up on it being Chinese or English or Voynich script or whatever. The key piece to his thought experiment is that he doesn't understand the symbols and is just applying an algorithm. Now, Searle is using a bit of smoke and mirrors in his thought experiment. By having him in both the understanding and non-understanding process, he's making you compare the intelligent him from the dumb him. His sleight of hand is in distracting you from realising just how astonishing his paper algorithm would need to be to appear intelligent. For example, say the questions started: 

That's irrelevant if the conscious entity cannot fully determine the next state. It may be relevant for a hypothetical, supernatural being but that's not at question here. 

Bell's inequality doesn't say that there can't be any hidden variables. What it says is that any theory consistent with quantum mechanics can't have hidden variables that are both causal and local. David Bohm's hidden variable theory, for example, is consistent with quantum mechanics but is non-local. As to your point about pre-determined systems. The key point is that one can set up a quantum system whereby a random event in one part of that system can affect the state in another part faster than message could be sent. Sure you can argue that the original system "knew" about the state of the random event generator before it started but this very swiftly gets into the realms of magic. 

On the basis that teleportation isn't noticeably less philosophically confusing than identical cloning, I would conjecture that whoever ends up in chamber B could safely assume that they didn't exist in any meaningful way prior to the transformation. As the premise of the question is that the person in chamber A can't know whether they are a clone or not, then it is entirely reasonable that they would be confused. I also note MarkOxford's comment about the Lewis conjectures. If the question had been whether or not they actually did exist prior to the operation then settling those questions would be necessary. Only if the person was completely convinced that, regardless of what happened, they definitely existed (or not) prior to the operation would the results be different. And that could, of course, occur whether or not it was actually or philosophically true. 

Firstly, note that the algorithm can't just answer questions, it needs context. It can't just look up and produce an answer. It can't even just go back to the previous question as it won't know who is. So it will need to have maintained contextual information through the whole conversation, in general, based on questions, answers and in-built knowledge. And not just trivial context, it would have needed to equate to and work out that refers to the . So, in order to appear intelligent for a simple exchange like this, the algorithm would need to be highly sophisticated; dealing with complex language issues, complex data interactions and state management. So, it may be fair to argue that the 'hardware' the algorithm runs on i.e. Searle doesn't have understanding. But I'd argue that the combination of the algorithm, the execution of the algorithm and the data could. 

I'll keep this answer to special relativity and quantum mechanics as their relationship is very well established. The relationship between general relativity and quantum mechanics is still largely speculative. For both the time evolution of special relativity and quantum mechanics, the very well attested, underlying mechanics are time reversible. In other words, the equations of motion are the same however you choose to interchange past, present and future. With just these two, there is nothing special about the past, present or future; these are just arbitrary points on a continuum. Observation is different and is, with indeterminism, the key driver for QM interpretations. In all the interpretations (that I'm aware of), something qualitatively special occurs in the present i.e. the point of observation. The effect, to the observer, is to make the past deterministic while leaving the future non-deterministic. In the Copenhagen interpretation, for example, this event is the waveform collapse. In others, such as the many worlds interpretations, the event is more subtle. In the latter, although there is no collapse per se, observation still has the effect of having a past that is not affected by other worlds with a future that is. So, taking QM observation into account, it is hard to justify a time equality interpretation. Without observation, it falls out of the equations quite naturally. 

In a certain sense your protagonist is correct. If your starting position is that logic and reason are correct, then applying logic to conclude that logic and reason are correct will always be circular. The trick is to not get all "truthy" about it. Logic is a useful tool for drawing inferences from a set of statements. That's all, nothing more mystical than that. And you need to be a little careful. In a comment you state: 

Minor point but they tend to see death as a transformation rather than not actually existing. And a comment on the attempt to link scientific theories to most extant religions. Please exercise caution here. These religions are very well established, very well documented and very well understood. They are not enhanced or validated in any way by superficial linking to modern science. The same goes with similar attempts in Christianity, usually with Genesis. 

For the class of evil that consists of bad things done deliberately by sentient beings then the main argument is free will. The logic being that, although what god created was good, that goodness included free will which left open the door for us to act evilly. Where this doesn't work is if you include natural acts as evil. For example: disease, tsunamis etc. With these, it's effectively impossible to use a free will argument but there can still be considerable suffering. In other words, there are evil consequences without direct evil intent. Now, if you're ok with your god having a bit of righteous anger in their armoury, then you can partially reconcile the natural disaster scenario with the concept of divine retribution. Some people used their free will to do bad things so god punishes them. What's left then is the suffering of the innocents. One may, possibly, be able to justify an abused child as being because of the free will of the abuser but the toddler lying in agony with a flesh eating disease? Not so much. The only justification I have heard for the latter is that we were born into sin so there's no such thing as an innocent. I, personally, find this argument abhorrent but YMMV. Also, personally, I don't buy the free will causing suffering in others argument either. Free will doesn't mean we can do anything (I can't jump to the moon) so why aren't we prevented from causing suffering? Whether these are convincing for you or not is, of course, up to you. For me, it's very hard to get past the suffering of the innocents problem. I have never seen anything that satisfactorily reconciles this with the accepted traits of the Christian god. I continue to look. 

The problem with this line of reasoning is that your refutations are not refuting the initial arguments. For the first argument, unless you're arguing that these groups do not have less social privilege, you're not affecting the view that that discrepancy can be ameliorated by positive discrimination. At best, your argument means that there are other groups e.g. poor, white males who suffer from a similar lack of social privilege, possibly for similar underlying reasons, that aren't being helped. This may well be true (I'd be very surprised if it isn't) but it doesn't mean that positive discrimination would not help the specific groups. It may open up a charge of unfairness but that's not a refutation. And your refutations do not at all address the second argument i.e. that diversity helps an organisation's performance. If it can be shown that that statement is empirically true, then it becomes a secondary consideration as to why it's true. Now, I'm reasonably familiar with this field and, to my knowledge, the only diversity metric that has been shown to have a material performance effect is male/female gender ratio. That's not to say the others don't but the academic backing is light. Having said all that, I happen to agree that there are deeper societal issues. Or to put it another way, it's not explicit discrimination at a company level that is the cause of the discrepancy so cannot be the driving solution. However, economic status is, I believe, a factor as is visible opportunity. As such, my view is these measures can help, and should be employed, but are by no means sufficient to resolve the underlying issues. Edit: Category Mistake To the question of whether the arguments are category mistakes. For the first argument, I would say no. These identity group do exhibit a lack of social privilege and that positive discrimination, at a hiring level, can alleviate some of the symptoms of that lack. For the second argument, I will have to hedge. It is not a category mistake for male/female gender diversity as that is well established to have a bearing on performance. I am not aware of research that concluded a positive impact of other identity diversity on team performance. So there may be a mistake there. Finally, in reference to a number of comments, it is very possible that the idea of identity selection, at an organisational level, does not significantly resolve the underlying causes of social privilege difference. Nor is it necessarily the most effective or just mechanism. As such, it may well be a category mistake to presume such. 

If you just want to use logic there is no counter argument as these are just propositions. As there's no argument there's nothing much to counter. I can see two ways in which you could offer a counter. One would be if you are assuming that the argument is for one who is born, death is certain therefore for one who is dead, birth is certain. This is just poor logic as if X then Y does not imply if Y then X. The other way is if you argue that the words have meaning. In which case there is plenty of evidence that would suggest that for one who is born, death is certain is likely to be true. There is currently no evidence that for one who is dead, birth is certain. Whether or not the lack of evidence bothers you is a separate matter. 

The answer depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you are interested in building understanding of the world such that you can better predict the future then, yes, science is currently the best approach we have. I mean this is the sense that it is the approach that has had the most success in this endeavour. It doesn't necessarily follow that it's the best in an optimal sense just that we have not discovered a more effective approach. There are, however, other definitions of best. For example, many people have a need to feel that there is purpose to their life. Science has been singularly useless at providing comfort to these people. If this is you aim then science is not the best worldview. 

No they can't. Or more precisely, they never have. This isn't too surprising as astrology is based on a cosmos that was thoroughly disproved centuries ago. The best they've ever been able to achieve is vague references to things that could apply to a large number of people. On the plus side, if an astrologer (or anyone else for that matter) was ever to accurately predict major future events it would not only prove your original proposition correct, it would also be the single most newsworthy story since news was invented (probably). So I'm sure we'd notice. 

The other answers raise the question of multiple possibilities. What I think is missing is that Conan Doyle puts this quote in Sherlock Holmes' mouth. Specifically, only one possibility, the truth, will fit all of the facts. As such, once you have all the facts then the answer is evident. The key, of course, is to have all the facts and, for that, you'll need Sherlock Holmes' abilities. Otherwise you can only eliminate some of the impossibilities and that won't be sufficient. Essentially, this is a form of humble bragging on Holmes' part: the dictum is true but only, in practice, for him. 

In general, yes. For example, there is no reason to believe that you need to have robbed a bank to have a valuable opinion on the morality of armed robbery. A felon may be able to offer a more useful opinion on, say, the logistics though. Similarly with sex. A pansexual may have a more nuanced view of the mechanics on sex but is not inherently wiser on the morality of such. 

No. One can argue that a different interpretation than is current may reduce the amount of public hate speech. Given that a number of countries do make hate speech illegal, it's not entirely obvious that this has led to less hate and tension. 

You appear to be implying that these effects are due to a philosophical failing. I would conjecture the exact opposite. They are, to a great extent, due to the overwhelming success, for the last 30 years or so, of the political philosophy of global capitalism. Note, I mean success in the sense of beating the competition rather than in some measure of absolute improvement. This philosophical success has led to significant prosperity in certain areas but has come at a cost. Clearly you aren't alone in thinking that this cost is too high. It's also worth pointing out that this philosophy is by no means universal. It does appear, for example, that the Scandinavian socialist model is reasonably stable in the long term. Many would argue that it has better overall outcomes than the US form of capitalism. I'd also argue that the state of the world does have something to say about academic philosophy. Unfortunately, it appears to me to say that it's mostly impotent. As a layman with an interest in philosophy, most public interaction I see tends to be on such subjects as the philosophy of consciousness, religion or quantum physics. Fascinating to be sure but of negligible impact on the world at large. Where I think philosophy does have contemporary impact is in medical ethics. What would be great is if we could take the approach there e.g. ethics departments and ethics committees, and apply those to business or government, say. Then maybe philosophy would have more potency.
