Recall that the covering number $cov(B)$ is the least cardinal $\kappa$ such that $\kappa$ meagre sets cover the real line. Andreas Blass and John Irwin $URL$ prove, among many other results, that $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$ (the infinite abelian group of integer-valued sequences under addition) is never the union of a chain of proper subgroups each isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$, if the chain has length less than $cov(B)$. They note it might be possible to remove the hypothesis on the length of the chain. However, they raise the question whether e.g. under $CH$, $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$ could be the union of a chain of proper subgroups each isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$. If the chain $\lbrace A_{\alpha} : \alpha < \delta \rbrace$ has the additional property that $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}/A_{\alpha}$ is cotorsion-free for all $\alpha < \delta$, the answer is negative. Has there been any further progress on this question? One could replace $\omega$ by any countable infinite index set $A$, for example $\mathbb{Q}$, if this might help. Section 6 of George Bergman's paper exploits this possibility to define unusual subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$: $URL$ My initial misguided thought had been to seek a forcing adding a "pawn", i.e. a new real $r \in {}^{\omega}{\omega}$ (or similar) such that the old and new Baer-Specker groups would nevertheless be isomorphic in the generic extension; one might then try to build a chain by adding enough pawns. Pawns do not exist, since every epimorphic image of $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$ is a direct sum of $\mathbb{Z}^{I}$ and a cotorsion group for some $I$, but $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega} \cap V$ is cotorsion-free. Forcings that add epimorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega} \cap V$ appear not to add reals. 

One simple ZFC-observation about $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, along the lines of the finite cross example, is well-known (see for details e.g. P. Komjath, V. Totik, Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory): any disjoint family of $Y$-sets is countable. A set $X$ is a $Y$-set if $X$ is the union of three line segments with a common endpoint. So if $S$ contains a homeomorph of a $Y$-set, the answer is positive in ZFC. 

Are there non-trivial equivalent characterizations of $\delta$-strongly compact (and almost strongly compact) cardinals in terms of generalized tree properties? Recall the definitions as per Joan Bagaria and Menachem Magidor, On $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinals, JSL 79 (2014), 266-278. Suppose $\delta > \omega$ is a cardinal. A cardinal $\kappa > \delta$ is $\delta$-strongly compact if for every set $I$, every $\kappa$-complete filter on $I$ can be extended to a $\delta$-complete ultrafilter on $I$. A limit cardinal $\kappa > \omega$ is almost strongly compact if $\kappa$ is $\delta$-strongly compact for every uncountable cardinal $\delta < \kappa$. Note that if $\lambda > \kappa$ and $\kappa$ is $\delta$-strongly compact, then $\lambda$ is also $\delta$-strongly compact, although, apparently serving the interests of Bavel, in the literature there are definitions going in the opposite direction, as noted in Joel's comment. My question is whether there are localized variants of strong and super tree properties that are equivalent to the parametrized large cardinal concepts. For example, can $\aleph_2$-strong compactness be characterized in terms of a strong tree property hovering around $\aleph_2$? The general project is the search for large cardinal properties that small cardinals may possess, once inaccessibility is dropped. Notice that by a theorem of Magidor, it is consistent that the first $\omega_1$-strongly compact is also the first measurable, in which case it is strongly compact, so will satisfy the strong tree property. But there is also a model of ZFC in which the first $\omega_1$-strongly compact is singular. The definitions of those generalized tree properties are given at the end of the question, below. The context is the results of Di Prisco, Erd√∂s, Jech, Magidor, Tarski, Weiss and Zwicker, who variously prove for the parameter-free concepts: Theorem Suppose $\kappa$ is inaccessible. 

I am (still) interested in trying to characterize and describe forcings that preserve Jonsson cardinals. A cardinal $\kappa$ is a Jonsson cardinal if there is no Jonsson algebra on $\kappa$, i.e. every algebra (in a countable language) of size $\kappa$ possesses a proper subalgebra also of size $\kappa$. V = L implies there are no Jonsson cardinals; $\aleph_0$ and many other cardinals are ZFC-provably not Jonsson cardinals; section 8 and some of section 23 of A. Kanamori, The Higher Infinite, contain a succinct account of the relevant results. Suppose $H$ is a family of standard models of ZFC that extend $V$ and have the same ordinals. Let us say the pair $(V, H)$ is Jonsson-friendly if whenever $\kappa$ is Jonsson in $V$, then $\kappa$ is Jonsson in $W$ for every $W \in H$. A forcing $\mathbb{P}$ is Jonsson-preserving if $(V, V^{\mathbb{P}})$ is Jonsson-friendly, where $V^{\mathbb{P}}$ is the family of $\mathbb{P}$-generic extensions of $V$. By a result of Erdos and Hajnal, a sufficient condition for $(V, H)$ to be Jonsson-friendly is that $V$ has the following approximation property for every $W \in H$: (JP) for every binary commutative function $f : \kappa \times \kappa \rightarrow \kappa$ in $W$, there exists $F \in V$ such that $V \models (F : \kappa \times \kappa \rightarrow [\kappa]^{\leq \omega}$ is a function$)$ and $(\forall \alpha, \beta < \kappa)(f(\alpha, \beta) \in F(\alpha, \beta))$. It follows that for example every ccc forcing is Jonsson-preserving. Q1: Can one characterize and describe the class of Jonsson-preserving forcings and any operations under which the class is closed? 

Perhaps it has been cited elsewhere in this context, but Hilary Putnam's 1980 short essay "Models and reality" brings together mathematics and philosophy in its discussion of $V = L$ and the Loewenheim-Skolem theorem: $URL$ Another source of recent interaction is the field of axiomatic theories of truth (Kripke, Herzberger, Leigh and Rathjen and others). For example: $URL$ Maybe these are examples of mathematical logic clarifying philosophy...

There is a surjection from $\mathbb{R}$ onto $\omega_{1}$, but none from $\omega$. (Edit: I see, buried amongst the many comments, that bof suggested this proof for $P(\omega)$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$; sorry.) I learnt it like this (from Komjath and Totik), using series expansions of reals. Let us say that $x \in \mathbb{R}$ codes $\alpha < \omega_{1}$ if $\langle \omega, < \rangle$ is a well order of type $\alpha$, where $i < j \in \omega$ iff the $2^{i}3^{j}$-digit of $x$ is $1$. Map $\mathbb{R}$ onto $\omega_{1}$ by sending $x$ to $\alpha$ if $x$ codes $\alpha$, otherwise map $x$ to $0$. Map to $0$ any real $x$ that does not code an ordered set, or that does code an ordered set but it is not well-ordered. 

Sorry this is late and you may already have it all sorted out more attractively. I think an argument might go as follows. It rests on K. Devlin, Variations on $\diamondsuit$, JSL 44 (1979), modified for the case of various diamonds on $\mathbb{c}$ instead of on $\omega_1$. Let $\diamondsuit^{Fr}(\mathbb{c})$ be Fremlin's principle of $5N$: there exists $\langle A_\xi : \xi < \mathbb{c} \rangle$ such that $(\forall A \subseteq \mathbb{c})(\exists 0 < \xi \in lim(\mathbb{c}))(A \cap \xi = A_\xi)$. Observe $\diamondsuit^{Fr}(\mathbb{c})$ implies $\diamondsuit_4(\mathbb{c})$: there exists $\langle S_\xi \subseteq P(\xi) : \xi < \mathbb{c} \rangle$ such that $(\vert S_\xi \vert \leq \aleph_0)$ and $(\forall A \subseteq \mathbb{c})(\exists 0 < \xi \in lim(\mathbb{c}))(A \cap \xi \in S_\xi)$. This needs no comment, save that the notation $\diamondsuit_4$ follows Devlin's paper. Now by the proof of Theorem 2.3 in that paper, modified to the case $\mathbb{c}$ instead of $\omega_1$, $\diamondsuit_4(\mathbb{c})$ implies $\diamondsuit_1(\mathbb{c})$ (Kunen's diamond on $\mathbb{c}$) which in turn implies $\diamondsuit(\mathbb{c})$.
