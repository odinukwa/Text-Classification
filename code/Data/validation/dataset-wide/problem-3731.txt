Harris's book on Algebraic Geometry has a lot of this in it. Try lectures 8 and 9, in 8 he introduces secant varieties and makes the first two nontrivial examples exercises (do them. It will help) and in 9 he talks about computing the secant variety of a determinantal variety. 

"Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves" by Liu might be good, it covers a lot of the same material, but does it more arithmetically. There's also "An Invitation to Arithmetic Geometry" by Lorenzini Also, don't discount the "series" by Silverman: "Rational Points on Elliptic Curves" (with Tate), "Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves", "Advanced Topics in the Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves" and "Diophantine Geometry" with Hindry. 

As a rule, the various groups and quotients of the divisor group on a variety have coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$. That is, you take $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of Weil divisors or Cartier divisors, and then to construct other groups you take quotients. However, in some cases, people tensor with $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$. So my question is: 

Is there an algorithm for solving the following problem: let $g_1,\ldots,g_n$ be permutations in some (large) symmetric group, and $g$ be a permutation that is known to be in the subgroup generated by $g_1,\ldots,g_n$, can we write $g$ explicitly as a product of the $g_i$'s? My motivation is that I'm TAing an intro abstract algebra course, and would like to use the Rubik's cube to motivate a lot of things for my students, and would, in particular, like to show them an algorithm to solve it using group theory. (That is, I can write down what permutation of the cubes I have, and want to decompose it into basic rotations, which I then invert and do in the opposite order to get back to the solved state.) Though I'm interested in the more general case, not just for the Rubik(n) groups, if a solution works out. Note: I don't really know what keywords to use for solving this problem, if someone can point me to the right search terms to google to get the results I'm looking for, I'll gladly close this. 

In addition to all the papers, there's even a book! "Integral closure: rees algebras, multiplicities, algorithms" by Vasconcelos. 

Well, one reason to think about correspondences as functions is that in (nice) geometric categories, they give maps on cohomology. For instance, let $X,Y$ be schemes (or manifolds, or topological spaces, or...) and let $Z\subset X\times Y$. Then $Z$ comes with two maps $Z\to X$ and $Z\to Y$ (or, it IS this, from your definition one). Under nice circumstances (proper, flat, etc) you get pushforwards and pullbacks between $Z$ and $X,Y$. So then you can get a map $\pi_1^\ast:H^\ast(X)\to H^\ast(Z)$ which can be composed with $\pi_{2\ast}:H^{\ast}(Z)\to H^\ast(Y)$, and another from $H^\ast(Y)\to H^\ast(X)$ by switching $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. So under fairly reasonable conditions, you get pushforwards and pullbacks along correspondences. Now, as for the more general categorical question, and span categories, and higher rings, I don't know much. I just know the above is necessary to even state the Geometric Langlands Conjecture properly, because you get Hecke correspondences between stacks, which give pushforwards and pullbacks on the derived categories. 

Here's a few that I found back when I was considering doing enumerative geometry: Gromov-Witten Theory and Donaldson-Thomas Theory I and II, referred to as MNOP Maps, Sheaves and K3 Surfaces by Pandharipande which is more of an overview type paper, and I believe discusses MNOP. Gromov-Witten, Gopakumar-Vafa, and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds by Katz, notes from a lecture where he does define everything. Not sure entirely that this is what you're looking for, but hope it helps. Generally Katz and Pandharipande do a lot of expositing on these things. 

I have to agree strongly with Ame's answer, in part. Weibel is a great place to go for the formalism. Once you have a little bit of the formalism, though, where to go depends on interests. To really see a lot of the power of derived functors, Hartshorne chapter 3 has some good theorems and exercises using them (though he does bounce back and forth with Cech cohomology...) and Huybrecht's "Fourier Mukai Transforms in Algebraic Geometry" book is very clear (at least to me) in the first few chapters, where he discusses derived categories (Note: I do disagree with Harry, this is a SECOND step, not a first for most) and makes extensive use of them, as he's interested in talking about derived categories, and they're the most natural thing in the universe there. Also, the following papers might help: Fourier Mukai Transforms and Applications to String Theory talks about how FM transforms (which are compositions of derived functors) help in string theory Derived categories for the working mathematician This is a wonderful paper, very clear about what the derived category is, and might help in conjunction with the books above. 

I recently worked through most of the proof of the rationality of the moduli of genus 3 curves, which seemed to have the following structure: 

Let $k$ be a field and $V\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ a smooth variety over $k$. (Note: not assuming $k$ is algebraically closed). Now assume that for some point (I'm willing to assume every point), the variety $V\setminus T_pV$ is isomorphic to an affine space. What can be said about the degree of $V$? I know that for $d=2$, this is true. Can it happen for anything that isn't a quadric, or does this property determine that you have a quadric, automatically? 

You can define the notion of an integrable system structure on a Poisson manifold, which allows them to be applied to solving problems in physics with enough symmetry. Every symplectic manifold is automatically Poisson Any Poisson manifold has a foliation by symplectic leaves. 

Look up Giraud's "Cohomologie Non-abelienne", it should answer most of your questions. And, for the record, for $i=1$, by an analagous argument, you get a cohomology set (only a group if abelian) which is the moduli of vector bundles of rank $n$, or more generally principal $G$-bundles, if you replace $GL(N,\mathbb{C})$ with another group $G$. Edit: "answer most of your questions" is somewhat stronger than what I actually meant. It's a place to start looking, and to see why the answer is far from trivial. I've heard vaguely that Lurie has some answers to this question (perhaps in Higher Topos Theory?) but I haven't had a chance to go through in detail and look at it. 

I'll give a bit of a physics definition. (Reference is "A Brief Introduction to Classical, Statistical and Quantum Mechanics" by B\"uhler.) "A mechanical system is called integrable if we can reduce its solution to a sequence of quadratures." So, literally, an integrable system (in this view) is one that can be solved by a sequence of integrals (which may not be explicitly solvable in elementary functions, of course). To connect to other answers, this should only work out when there are enough symmetries for us to write down and integrate. 

So here's the issue: $\mathcal{M}_1$ is not an algebraic variety. It's only a stack. But you're looking at the coarse moduli space, which is roughly the algebraic space that most closely approximates the stack, and in this case, it's actually a smooth affine variety. Here's some context and details: let $k$ be a field not of characteristic 2 or 3 (there's a more complex proof in those cases, but I'm going for simple.) Then, you can write every genus 1 curve as $y^2=x(x-1)(x-\lambda)$ for some $\lambda\neq 0,1$, which gives you what's often called the $\lambda$-line $\mathbb{A}^1_k\setminus\{0,1\}$ which parameterizes a family containing every genus 1 curve up to isomorphism. So then you want to check which curves are isomorphic, and this problem is solved by the $j$-invariant, which gives a map $\mathbb{A}^1_k\setminus \{0,1\}\to \mathbb{A}^1_k$. This latter line, the $j$-line, is the coarse moduli space, and it is not too hard to show that, from a definition of coarse moduli space of a functor (your functor is flat families of smooth genus 1 curves). 

"Algebraic geometry seems to have acquired the reputation of being esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics. In one respect this last point is accurate." - David Mumford 

If you're interested in something that's expected to do this (here, with a related paper here), but is a very current project, there's Lazic's proof of the finite generation of (log) canonical rings. I don't know of any great insights gained from the new proof, other than the surprising fact that it's POSSIBLE to prove it this way, and that the method, rather than requiring the Mori program to prove the theorem, allows a proof of many important theorems in the Mori program from it. This is, though, quite a work in progress. 

In a research statement, he says: "The essence of arithmetic geometry lies not in the various specific schemes that occur in a specific arithmetic-geometric setting, but rather in the abstract combinatorial patterns, along with the combinatorial algorithms that describe these patterns, that govern the dynamics of such specific schemes." Regarding this, he then talks about how his main motivations are monoids, Galois categories, and dual graphs of degenerate stable curves, which leads him to talking about his geometry of categories stuff, and then to "absolute anabelian geometry." He then links to a bunch of papers that I would assume elaborate a bit on it. He then goes on to talk about extending Teichmuller Theory. Generally, his research statement is fairly readable (and consider that I'm very much a nonspecialist in arithmetic anything) and seems to link to things with more details. 

Some Pixar/Dreamworks stuff might be good...a Pixar guy gave a cool talk at ICM a few years ago about the mathematics they use to do the 3d rendering, topping it with harmonic coordinates. 

There is not one. Reference is Milne's notes, Prop 3.9. More is true, Prop 3.10 in the same notes is that any rational map from a unirational variety to an abelian variety is constant. 

I will admit flat out that I don't know what I'm saying, really, so take it with a grain of salt, but I've been told (numerous times) that the cotangent complex measures the deformation theory of your (variety, scheme, stack, whatever). 

Whenever I'm doing something and I'm trying to see what difference coarse and fine moduli spaces make, I test the theorem with the STACK M_1 of genus 1 curves and with the variety which is the coarse moduli space of genus 1 curves, A^1, so A^1 is one of my favorite coarse moduli spaces. 

You would probably do well with any of the resources under "D-modules" on Gaitsgory's page. Ginzburg's lectures are good, as is the book by Hotta, Takeuchi and Tanisaki. 

A graph is called vertex and edge transitive if the automorphism group is transitive on both vertices and edges. The spectrum of a graph is the collection (with multiplicities) of eigenvalues of the incidence matrix. Supposedly, it is conjectured that almost all graphs have the property that they are the unique graph with their spectrum (at least, according to MathWorld). If $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ are two vertex and edge transitive graphs, with the same valence, which are isospectral (have the same spectrum) then does it follow that $\Gamma_1\cong \Gamma_2$? 

It can be seen as a first step in a classification of singularities. In particular, looking at the completions there can give you quite a lot of information about the singularity itself, and is comparable to looking in a small open set on a complex variety. For instance, I believe that problem involves a classification of all double points of plane curves, and you can use the isomorphism type of the completion to tell things like how many branches the curve has at that point, are they tangent, to what order, etc. 

The product is just $\mathbb{P}^n_X$ (because it is $X\times_S (S\times\mathbb{P}^n_\mathbb{Z})$. The fibers then of $\mathbb{P}^n_X\to X$ are projective spaces, and thus connected, so all you need is $X$ is connected. 

Well, such categories are actually proper classes. For instance, spaces that are homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ will be given on ANY set of the same cardinality. So how many there are, depends on how many such sets there are...but there are quite a lot of sets. In fact, more than any individual set worth. (Though on the details there, I'm not sure about what happens for fixed cardinality) We CAN identify them, and we get a skeleton. However, we usually don't do this, because there's no natural way to pick one object in each class, and one of the important catch phrases for category theory is "never make a choice." (Naturally, this is a vast oversimplification, but it's a good rule of thumb) 

Let $\cal X$ be a DM stack of finite type over a field (if necessary, I will assume that $k=\mathbb{C}$ and $\cal X$ is a scheme, or even a variety) and $G$ be a finite group. Then we have a quotient stack $[\mathcal{X}/G]$ and in fact we have a natural morphism $\phi:\mathcal{X}\to [\mathcal{X}/G]$. Is $\phi$ always flat? If not, under what conditions is $\phi$ flat? 

No, the map isn't generally bijective. For curves, normalization is the same as resolution of singularities. Look at a nodal cubic curve $y^2=x^2(x-1)$ in the plane. Over the node, the normalization has two points. 

Let $f:X\to Y$ be a generically finite proper morphism of varieties. There is some locus in $Y$ over which the fiber of $f$ is positive dimensional, so we blow it up, along with the preimage of it in $X$ to get a map $\tilde{f}:\tilde{X}\to\tilde{Y}$ which has finite fibers. Are there any nice conditions that will guarantee that the map $\tilde{f}$ is flat?
