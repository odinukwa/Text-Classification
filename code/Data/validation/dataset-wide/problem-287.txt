A black hole does not have any magic properties, it does not "radiate" time dilation or any other nonsense like that. Noticable time dilation happens when one observer moves at relativistic speeds with reference to another, or when one observer is under much higher gravitational acceleration than another. In the movie "Interstellar", the crew of a spaceship landed on a planet that orbited a supermassive black hole. Being on the surface of that planet is said to cause a time dilation of 7 years on Earth for each hour on the planet surface, in other words a Lorentz factor of > 61,000. The scientific problem with that is that the numbers don't nearly add up. The planet itself has 1.3g surface gravity. That causes a negligible time dilation compared to Earth. That only leaves relativistic speed compared to Earth as the source of time dilation. For a Lorentz factor of 61,000 and ignoring the effect of the planet's surface gravity, you would need a relative speed of 99.999999987% of c, the speed of light. That is how fast the planet would have to orbit around its black hole in order to cause the time dilation presented in the story, and is obviously impossible. Even if you had a planet rotating that quickly, in order to land on it, you would have to match its orbit, i.e. you would at least have to accelerate your spaceship to the same speed. The movie got a lot of things right, and even caused some scientific papers to be written, but that bit about time dilation, while necessary for the story, was the worst kind of nonsense: Scientifically sound, but the numbers were way, way off. 

Burning fossil fuels on Mars is highly impractical. Burning coal means using up oxygen, which is not easily available on Mars. As long as the human population on Mars has to live in environmentally closed colonies, Oxygen has to be produced by cultivated plants through photosynthesis, liberated from water or minerals at prohibitive energy cost, or even imported from Earth. As long as Mars is not terraformed and therefore not producing a large surplus of oxygen through photosynthesis, coal or other fossil fuels are not an economical option for energy generation. If and when Mars has been terraformed into something resembling Earth, burning fossil fuels is just as viable as on Earth. However, by that time the technological and scientific state of the art must have advanced so much that burning coal for warmth is most likely obsolete anyway. 

Assuming the C. impactor had a density of solid rock (think granite), it had a density of about 2500 kg/m³. A 2x4 Lego brick has a weight of 2.5 grams and a volume (including the empty space between struts) of 4823 mm³, which gives a Lego structure a density of ca. 518 kg/m³ when assembled, so the L. impactor had about a fifth of the density of the C. impactor. Therefore, if the L. impactor had the same speed as the C. impactor, it would have about 20% of the total kinetic energy. However, in the grand scheme of things, that is not a significant difference. Using all the provided paramters and putting them into the Earth Impact Effects Program, we see that the C. impactor and the L. impactor leave quite similar-sized craters. Only the amount of ejected material is about proportional to their kinetic energy. All in all, the L. impactor looks a lot like another extinction-level event. Because of their kinetic energies, while differing by a factor of 5, with current technology we have about the same options for defending against the L. impactor as we would have against the C. impactor: None. 

Changing the Sun's luminosity would require significantly increasing or reducing the rate of fusion the Sun performs. Short of dumping several Jupiters worth of hydrogen into the Sun to significantly increase its weight, fusion rate, and luminosity, I don't see how this could ever be achieved, let alone with near-future technology. What you are looking for is the perceived brightness of an object from a certain point in the universe, which is a property that depends on the sun's luminosity, distance of observer, and blocking objects in the line of sight from sun to observer. Since the distance is determined by the position of the observer and we can't change the Sun's luminosity, we have to work with line-of-sight-blocking objects. To use the Sun as a signal lamp, you would do the exact same: You put up and remove shades periodically to create a signal. Then other civilizations can use standard transit method to catch that signal. Depending on the distance over which you want to transfer the signal and assumed or known technical capability of the receivers, you will need shades with moon- to planet-sized diameters and a means to control their orbit around the Sun. A solar sail of sufficient size should do the job. In order to differentiate a sail from an actual planet and make it clear that it is an artifical signal, you probably want to create some sort of signal that comes to close to actual communication. For example, you could build several sails and arrange them in such a way that their light/shade pattern communicates a mathematical sequence over time, such as the first few prime numbers, or the start of the Fibonacci sequence. You can also make the sail rectangular rather than circular, to produce a sharper drop in brightness on the detecting end. As for technological feasability: In 2014, the largest solar sail launched to date was a square of only 38m on a side, for an area of 0.0014 km² and a weight of 32 kg. Earth's radius is about 6370 km, so a disk with Earth's radius (or an equal-sized rectangle) would have an area of 127 million km², or 88 billion times larger (and heavier!) than the 2014 solar sail. In short, no, using the Sun as a signal lamp is not feasible with reasonably expected near-future technology. You are looking at millions of tons of material that has to be manufactured and then launched into a solar orbit. Note that even with future technology, when it would be possible it would not at all be reasonable. If you want to announce your presence at the speed of light, simply turn on a large radio broadcast at a specific wavelength to penetrate the interstellar medium, or, if you know where the aliens are, shine a bright, focused laser beam at their solar system. Those methods are infinitely cheaper and simpler than changing the brightness of the Sun, and, best of all, they are trivially available with 1950's or earlier technology. 

No. If theoretical physics is your only showstopper, then as long as a body is not a Black Hole, anything can, in principle and given enough energy, escape from its surface. But even in practice it will be difficult to prevent. There is a lot of room between "black hole" and "easily escapable planet". However, if the advanced civilization only wants to lock the other population rather than outright exterminate it, the parameters you mentioned have to remain in a range that does not kill the population directly, or indirectly by destroying the planet's ecosystem or the population's essential technology base. That does not seem to leave much room to work with, because both have evolved to deal with the current e.g. gravity, not with significantly higher gravity. Also note that rocketry is not the only way to escape the gravity well: A space elevator, for example, does not care about the density of the atmosphere or the surface gravity, as long as there is a material with sufficient tensile strength available to construct the elevator in the first place. 

Lithotropes do not literally eat rocks. Rocks are a mix of inorganic minerals that have very little to no available chemical energy, which is why there is so much of it. If minerals were an actual food source, rock-eating organisms would be the dominant life form on Earth by a large margin, if organic life existed at all. Instead they consume non-organic matter, i.e. matter that does not contain organic compounds, but only those that still contain a usable energy potential, such as ions, salts, or hydrogen. The main problem for lithotrophes is that their source of energy has a very low density. A macroscopic organism would require impractically high amounts of food to survive and thrive simply because of its mass. One kg of microbes can spread out much further and be more efficient at gathering food than one macroscopic organism of the same weight. Large organisms are also less efficient than microscopic ones overall, because an increasing share of its body is devoted to purposes other than finding and processing food, such as structural cells, nervous system, propulsion, reproduction, and so on. Macroscopic lithotrophes might be possible on a world that contains an abundance of such energy sources, and where those energy source would be constantly produced by other processes so that those creatures have enough time to evolve, but it certainly wouldn't be possible on Earth. 

According to Wikipedia, a modern Lithium-Ion battery has a specific energy of 0.36-0.95 MJ/kg or 100–265 W·h/kg. According to this rather recent research paper, a battery made from carbon nanotube springs has a recorded specific energy of 6.7 kJ/kg, with a theoretical limit of ca. 0.67 MJ/kg, so very similar to modern Li-Ion batteries. Carbon nanotubes are among the most optimal materials for mechanical energy storage, so that value is near the high end of mechanical energy storage. A typical modern locomotive weighs around 100 tons and its engine has a power output of 2-3 MW. Therefore, in order to power a 3MW locomotive at full power for one hour, you will need 3 MW-hours of energy, or a fully loaded battery with a weight of at least 11.3 tons. For 2 hours, you need 22.6 tons of battery, and so on. Modern high-speed locomotive engines can have an even higher output and energy requirement. In conclusion: While it seems possible to have mechanical battery-powered trains, even for several hours long trips, the weight of a battery will always reduce its efficiency, and therefore such trains would overall use more power than an equivalent present-day electric train. Since trains go on fixed tracks anyway, adding static power lines and getting rid of the batteries is an obvious improvement. Batteries for cars and other vehicles that do not have to follow fixed paths cannot be powered by static power lines and always have to carry their own fuel or batteries. As current development shows, battery-powered cars etc. are still possible and economical compared to combustion-powered equivalents. 

The impact on the transportation industry would be fairly minimal. In those parts of the world that have ready access to modern transportation, "running at a brisk pace" is something few people do regularly for any length of time unless they're doing it for sport. Read: People would be too lazy to fly themselves. Physical exertion means sweating and being out of breath, which is not socially adequate for many modern jobs with customer contact or in an office environment. There could be companies that accommodate for that by providing showers, but such companies already exist, if they want to be friendly to bike commuters, so not much would change there either. Since everyone can fly, it would be as mundane as walking is nowadays. Essentially, this is the same question as "Humans can walk, what happens to the transportation industry?" Well, nothing, because walking and modern transportation cover different needs. Humans would also still not be able to carry large amounts of goods, so the logistics part of the transportation industry would be affected even less than passenger transport. 

Yes, it's absolutely possible and does not even depend on time travel, it is a universal principle that holds true in all ages and places. The safest way to doing things that are dangerous to you or others in the way you describe is to secure the benevolence and protection of the ruling elite. Except for true religious fanatics, people are highly adaptive to even drastically new situations and realpolitik will trump dogma. If you manage to convince the right people that your inventions will consolidate their power, bring them great fame and riches, advance the position of their town/country compared to rivals, or give them whatever else they might crave, they will allow you to do a great many things, even things that most people would find to be repulsive for moral or religious reasons. 

With current or near-future technology, no, it's not possible. First of all, terminology: the Luminosity of an astronomical object is 

Overall, assuming the political background does not significantly obstruct the exploration into impossibility, we are looking at several hundred person-years as an absolute minimum for exploring the whole station. Let's make it 1000 person-years. In practice, space technology and space-faring economics will be the most limiting non-political factor. The Apollo program managed to put a total of 18 people on the moon, for an average of 10 days each, over a time span of ~3 years from the first landing (Apollo 11) to the last (Apollo 17), or 60 person-days per year. At 1000 person-years required, this would require a continuous Apollo program with a duration of ~6000 years. Modern space technology will not significantly improve the economics of going to the moon or its smaller brother. The rocket equation still holds as true today as it did in the 1970's. You will still use oxygen and hydrogen as your fuel. You will still have to use multi-stage rockets made of light and durable metals. In order to fundamentally reduce the costs or increase the frequency at which you can send stuff to the moon and back, you would need novel ways of doing so, such as a space elevator or a space fountain. 

If their bone structure can withstand the stress, then they can, but it will be exhausting and highly uncomfortable. For comparison, imagine carrying around your own body weight in extra weight all day and night, evenly distributed over your body. Every step will be a chore, lifting your arms and even your head will feel like workout, every breath you take is a struggle. Not even lying down is much comfort because you will be pulled down so hard. You will want only your most able-bodied aliens to ever visit Earth, and even they will require some sort of mechanical exosuit or strength-boosting medication to get through the day without too many problems. 

No, the length of the year has no effect on the seasons other than their respective duration. Seasons are caused by the axial tilt of the Earth, not by the length of the year. The length of the year only determines how long the seasons are in absolute terms, but their relative duration would still be the same. Spring would still be a quarter of the year, same as summer etc. That being said, Earth's axial tilt does vary over time, on a ca. 40,000 year cycle, with the moon acting as a stabilizer. If you design a world with a much longer year and a much shorter axial tilt cycle, you could make your variable seasons per year work. 

While the Oort cloud, by current estimates, has enough total mass to construct several Earth-sized planets, there are problems. According to NASA, the Oort cloud is mostly ice comets, made of water, methane, and ammonia. There certainly are rock comets as well, but it is questionable whether there is enough rocky material to make a proper Earth-sized rock planet. You can't make an arbitrarily small habitable planet, because the lower its gravity, the faster it loses its atmosphere to solar wind. The next problem is the magnetic field. In order to create a magnetic field from its core, the core has to be active, i.e. it needs to rotate within a liquid outer core. That requires heat, which comes from radioactive decay and residual heat from the planet formation. While mushing together the rocks into a planet would certainly generate heat, the radioactive decay might be absent for lack of fissible material. I have no way of determining whether that would be enoguh heat to get sufficient geological activity going for long enough to matter. In order to support agriculture, significant quantities of topsoil are required. Topsoil, in turn, is mostly microorganisms and organic matter in various stages of decomposition. Those would be impossible to obtain in outer space and would have to be imported from Earth. Overall, I believe you could get some sort of planet or planetoid going from Oort cloud materials, put water and an atmosphere on it and put it into the habitable zone of Sol, but getting a self-sustaining biosphere going will be hard, if not impossible. However, even if those problems can be overcome, there is little rational reason to do so. A Dyson sphere, its variants, or similar mega-scale space habitats would most likely be a more efficient use of the available resources.
