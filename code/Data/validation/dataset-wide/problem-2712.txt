You might find what Aristotle said about this question in his Physics over two millenia ago; he begins first by identifying contraries as principles if nature (ie as laws of nature), in Greek arche: 

The last sentence appears uncontentious: There was a time when there were no human beings and yet the universe existed. Thus the universe is independent of human consciousness. However this objection seems such an easy one to make that there must be other good reasons why some are prepared to countenance a mind-dependent universe even on physical grounds and why they forego the previous objection. It seems plausible that a distinction has to be made between mind-indepedent and human-mind-independent, and its the latter that the forgoing objection disposes of. Is this it, or am I missing something else more fundamental here? If so, what are they? 

In my reading of this extract Wittgenstein is simply saying that ethics is not reducible to logic. All propositions are of equal value because propositions are statements in a system of logic, and each such statement has the same moral & ethical weight, that is none. The sense of the world must lie outside of the world that the world in itself carries no meaning, we bring meaning and sense to it, our understanding is not objectively part of the world. It looks like here that Wittgenstein is subscribing to some kind of dualism between matter & mind. Ethics cannot be expressed that they cannot be fully quantified and reduced to a system of signs within a system of logic. That is it cannot be systemised. It is transcendental, that is beyond logic, and beyond human reason. This does not mean that it cannot be reasoned about, as we most obviously do; nor does this mean that we must be silent about it, as most certainly are not - it is simply the acknowledgement that in essence and in totality it lies beyond our capacity as rational beings. (One could argue that this is consistent with Islamic & Christian theological thinking on ethics, an attribute of the divine and not of the human. Of course its not quite the same thing). 

No, it just means that any science doesn't have universal validity; and one must probe and question to find out what those boundaries are; they may not be fixed once they are found. Sceptism is targeted at universal claims. 

If I remember Russells Short History of Western Philosophy correctly, Russell unequivocally maintains that Thales was the first philosopher of note. He said: 

The first thinkers on nature were the Ionian cosmologists; and the first thinkers on mathematics were the Pythagoreans - their thinking was also explicitly religous; with for example, Pythagoras even being seen as a religous leader. They too, given Platos thinking on the One can be seen as cosmologists. Quite commonly it's understood that the rational and enquiring spirit logos crystallised out of the inconsequential religous mythos; but one could argue along with Webers The spirit of Capitalism and the Protestant Ethic as something that was a fundamental constituent of thinking then. Mathematics first became explicitly involved (and religion slowly disengaged) in Physics in the modern sense with Galileo; and the calculus of Liebniz and Newton - but now with multiple affinities; still, the subject divisions are visible - for example, calculus is heavily used in Physics; it's justification by analysis, though of interest to mathematicians is not usually seen to be of interest to physicists. The major divisions of knowledge is posited by Badious division of the Understanding along the positive (truth-producing) axes of love, politics, arts and sciences; and the negative (critical) spirit of philosophy; these should be seen as not literally pure, though disciplines have an arete (virtue) that have deeper affinities. For example the structuralism of Bourbaki (in mathematics) and of Levi-Strauss (in anthropology) had such an affinity, that Levi-Strauss had to explicitly deny this causal possibility - securing his discipline on the semiotics of Saussure. Another concept that is useful to understanding this division, this individuation amongst the unitary body of knowledge, is the concept theorised by the anthropologist Mary Douglas, degout which regulates the potential and possibility of pollution; for example this is implicit in the interdisciplinary philosopher (in poetics, politics, theology) Kearneys criticism of the Academy on avoiding interdisciplinarity as it risked the purity of disciplines. Another philosopher who ignores disciplinary boundaries is Deleuze; his very prose using the transgressive tactics of the artistic avant-garde: symbol and image, montage, cut up, disorientation and aporias suggestive in Mallarmes poetics, for example. Still, it's important to recognise I think that Aristotle, usually considered as the first scientist also wrote on politics, ethics and physics; and in a substantial way; as did Lucretious who inherited the atomic theory of Democritus mediated by Epicurus. 

Following on from Shanes answer; and making the connection with the world from a logical analysis of language; I'd also look at the semantics of Kripkes modal logic and its interpreatation: that is something is neccessarily true iff it is true in every possible world. I can conceive of a world where the number of planets in our solar system is 5; thus it is not neccesarily true that the number of planets in our solar system in 8. But I can't conceive of any possible world where 8 is not even; thus this is a neccessary truth. 

This is a remark that ancestrally informed the notion of the Hermeneutic Circle, and this seems to be apposite, at least to me, to Einsteins concerns. 

Or, how 'wine' is used as a symbol for the life of the senses, and it's opposite the ideal; in the poetry of Keats: 

Here is a possibility: that it is in fact no different than to be sane. For in Kants theory of mind we can distinguish the Intellect from the Intuition; and it is the Intuition which presents the Intellect with sense-experience. If the Intuition plays false and presents the Intellect with a false picture of reality, the Intellect has no choice but to construct a new theory of reality. For example in conventional reality a wolf cannot suddenly jump through the wall into my room; but say that I saw that in fact it does hold; that in fact a wolf did just this once, then in this unconventional reality I can rationally hold that such things do happen. 

Intuitionism is akin to constructivism in mathematics but not quite the same from what I can tell. In the usual treatment of the real line, the additional numbers are found between the rationals by supremum, that is for a sequence of rationals like 3,31/10,314/100,.. we can approaches the real number pi. But constructively can we allow such a principle since we are positing the existence of such a number, without in fact actually constructing it - we are just getting arbitrarily close to it. Wikipedia explains this as a choice sequence 

A useful contrast is a priori with a posteriorai; and to take each as a kind of ideal point. Arguments in science can be closer to either in this continuum. Consider what constitutes a definition of force in Aristotle - though he doesn't use the word: 

The quick answer is that the hyperbolic plane is two-dimensional. In fact any surface is 2-dimensional no matter how it bends or curves. That a curved surface requires a third dimension is (mathematically speaking) an artifact of the 3-d ness of the space we live in. After all, when I imagine a straight line, I can imagine it in air, or more fundamentally surrounded by nothing at all. That is not only have I eliminated the air surrounding the line, but also the space occupied the air. Similar reasoning applies to a curved line, or to a curved surface. 

Arguably placing such basic categerical considerations in the mind as space and time does not deny them a reality; but Schopenhauer disagrees - in part it seems because it attacks the 'proud, dogmatic structure'. 

Its worth noting that Naess was a participant of the Vienna Circle, the exemplary root of the analytic tradition. 

He writes 'Not long ago Nazism transformed the whole of Europe into a veritable colony', meaning that the techniques pioneered in the colonies of Europe were turned upon Europe itself, culminating in the horrors of the holocaust, mirroring that, of say the Belgian Congo. [I've asked this question in History.stackExchange but also asked this here as I wan't sure whether this is really a question of History or of Political Philosophy. I err towards the latter. Fanon is classed as a Philosopher on Wikipedia.] As further evidence, I've read somewhere the philosophers Simone Weil & Hannah Arendt made similar claims. 

According to Wikipedia, there is no account of how the sphericity of the Earth was established. Though it goes on to say 'A plausible explanation is that it was "the experience of travellers that suggested such an explanation for the variation in the observable altitude and the change in the area of circumpolar stars, a change that was quite drastic between Greek settlements" around the eastern Mediterranean Sea, particularly those between the Nile Delta and the Crimea' According to the same article the Sphericity of the Earth was widely accepted by the Greeks 5th century BCE. With Aristotle providing, what appears to me fairly flimsy arguments in 4th Century BCE, and more compelling evidence by Aristarchus in the 3rd BCE. This is quite a time-lapse, and hints at Aristarchus providing evidence for a theory already established. (A contemporary analogy would be Eddingtons expedition providing evidence for Einsteins theory of Gravitation - whose compelling physical idea was the equivalence of inertial & gravitational mass) As the Greeks moved from a mytho-poetic cosmology to one focused on rational enquiry, were there general philosophical ideas that arose, and that would have proposed and made convincing the case for a spherical Earth? 

-Hannah Arendt, Denktagebuch, vol. 2, p. 728 Does this connect to Deleuzes idea of philosophy as he wrote in What is Philosophy? 

It seems plausible to me that they could equally have been called pre-Plato. Whats the significance of Socrates? Did he instill an ethical turn in Hellenic philosophy (or be seen to do so)? 

There's a useful discussion of these issues in Bohms Wholeness and the Implicate Order; the discussion below is derived from this as well as other sources. Aristotle identified four causes in his Metaphysics (this word shouldn't be understood here as a kind of 'mystic' word, but as arguing from first principles); and which are: 

This compatibility was of course one of the specific goals of Kant given the single-minded and severe scepticism of Hume; one might say he pushed Descartian Scepticism as far as it could go in dissolving reality; if Parfitt does not take it even further. Now, in the quotation from Jones, one can identify solidity and impenetrability, or say the latter expands the first; and in our direct experience this is definitely true - but can it remain true in our best physical theories? Perhaps, if judiciously interpreted; fermionic matter (ie electrons) obeys the Pauli Exclusion Principle - ie impenetrability; bosonic matter doesn't: but this signifies from another point of view that they are indistinguishable. In GR, which is a classical theory rigidity of a classical body by loss of absolute simultaneity loses meaning; but one can suppose a certain modified notion of elasticity can still hold adequate to GR. Is this an adequate conception of what impenetrability means given the apparatus of modern physics - or must one scout further? 

In the Copenhagen interpretation, the State evolves deterministically punctuated by a non-deterministic collapse. In the Consistent Histories interpretation, the State evolves deterministically but is inaccessible, one measures the probability for a consistent set of histories which are decoherences of the State with the environment. 

It's commonly understood that Parmenides denied the reality of change. That the world we perceive is an illusion. But is Parmenides better understood as the SEP indicates: 

I don't think the bit is the fundamental unit of information. It is from a certain perspective, but others could be chosen. The rationale in brief goes like this: a. What knowledge we have can be codified mathematically b. mathematics can always be coded as numbers c. the simplest representation in a number system is in base 2 step a) is where knowledge as opposed to information commonly falls down which is what you point out by admitting the difference between information and 'semantics'. The bit is simply a good engineering choice - this is not to detract from its importance. When it is said the bit is fundamental the context should be preserved and this is the computational and engineering context. Writing is a form of information, were there no actual person to understand it, it would be merely a sequence of geometric forms separated by spaces. You're right about mistaking information (as in bits) that is c) for knowledge a) is turning the world upside down. But of course bits can themselves become a new source of knowledge. So the situation is more subtle than I've described. 

Descarte used a form of this reasoning; he suggested since matter has extension and space is extensive then they are in essence the same; this was picked up by Spinoza where he said the essential attribute of the physical world was extension. So, though it might be a fallacy to equate them; it might be pointing to something deeper. Here is another example from physics: one of the most established results in quantum gravity is Bekenstein-Hawking radiation; this came about originally by an observation of Bekenstein that since the event horizon of a black hole could only increase and since in general the entropy of a system could only increase too; then we should identify them; the obvious counter-answer is that this means that black holes have temperature; which means that they radiate; but classically they don't - so a contradiction never mind it being a fallacy; it turned out though when Hawking set out to prove Bekenstein wrong he found his intuition held up. So perhaps this fallacy is not always a fallacy...and is it fallacious to call a fallacy a fallacy if it sometimes fails at being a fallacy?
