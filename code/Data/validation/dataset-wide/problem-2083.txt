The first contact for the best job I ever had was a complete, bizzare joke. The second best job had a very painful first meething (not funny at all, rather hostile). I stuck with both (for whatever reason each time), and both jobs where nothing like the interview process. In both cases, I worked with the people who interviewed me, later, and it turned out that they were great at what they do, just interviewing was not their forte. So, if the "content" of those jobs is fine, I'd safely suggest to ignore the form. Unless, of course, you are shooting for a position in the HR department. :-) 

If you're quite friendly with your coworkers, you can just say "Hey, thanks for inviting me, but I'm really not into mini-putt. Plus I have a lot of work right now, so I'm just gonna pass for this one". If not, you may want to find a more formal way to decline the invite. This is if you want to decline. If you're not particularely interesting in binding with your coworkers outside the office, just don't go. Otherwise, it might be worth sucking it up for this time and accept the invitation. You can mention you aren't really into mini-putt, but want to spend some time with them out of the office, and next time you can propose somthing that suits you better. It's especially true if everyone but you is going. You might get behind in bounding with the rest of the team. 

If it is a simple thing (going bowling), just say no. Same as above. If the company is throwing a big event (high costs involved, the whole company or department going somewhere, with upper management addressing the mob), then it may just be that you would indeed be served well with being there. Stick through it, be done with it. This should not happen all to often. 

Welcome to the club ... of people chatting at lunch breaks. Awkward silences happen, and it's not something to worry about. Also, not everybody needs to be a lightly chatting wonder of entertainment. Relax Really, the best way to handle this (and pretty much every other social "situation") is to relax. Don't think about possible topics before you go to lunch. Don't do your best to hunt around for ideas while eating. Speak when it feels natural, keep your silence when it does not. If people cannot stand an introvert at the table, that's not your problem, really (unless you happen to work in a field where extroverts are required; say if it is your main job to go lobbying new customers, then being an introvert probably is a problem...). Speak If you are asked something and simply do not know any answer, then still relax. You can look at your partner for a few seconds (just slightly more than a normal answer would take), and if after that span you still cannot think of anything, then calmly, friendly, in an amused way, tell them "Good question, Sir, and you caught me cold here - I cannot think of anything at the moment." That's miles better than stammering around, and since such an admission is actually not too easy to make, it might quite improve your standing, in their eyes. The trick is to convince you that such an answer is OK and not something that will hurt you. If you can do that (i.e., convince yourself), then you can also deliver such a line in a convincing way which doesn't let you appear as some kind of fool. 

Short answer : DON'T It's really common for hiring companies to check with your previous employers. If they do, they'll find out you lied. You could also be exposed if anyone in the company you're applying for knows someone in your previous company. And I could probably write a 10 pages list of other ways this could go wrong. If they find out you lied before you get hired, they'll cancel the whole process. Then two things can happen : either you're lucky, and you're only busted for this precise company. Or you're not and they know people, making it incredibly hard for you to ever get a job in this field. No matter how good you are, nobody likes a liar. But let's assume they don't check and you get the job. How much would you like to work knowing that any minute you can get instantly fired with the potential consequences I already stated? Personaly this would drive me crazy. if you're an honest guy and not a good liar as you stated, I bet it will be the same for you. The website is a pretty good idea. Stick with it, and be honnest 

I assume that you are the project lead. Warning: this answer may seem rough/offensive/negative. It is not meant to be, though. Just clear statements without any word-mincing. The term "responsibility" is used in the sense of "accountability", not in the sense of "primary cause". 

Eye contact, body language I have had that situation, and know the feeling. In your case (no frequent interactions) I would suggest this algorithm: 

Talk to your manager and say that you have a problem. Don't say that the guy is being a problem. Reasoning: if you tell your manager that you are having a problem, there is little the manager can say against that. He cannot say "no, you are not having a problem", but ideally only "what can I do to solve your problem" or, best case, "I know what you mean, don't do anything, I will solve your problem". If, instead, you describe the guy as a problem, people can easily argue. "That guy is around for years and doing his fun stuff, and nobody ever had a problem with it." So: 

This is very dependant on company culture (which may itself depend on the field and country you work in). From my experience in IT (in France, but as far as I know this is the case in most country), people won't care or even notice a 5 minutes difference. Generally speaking the precise amount of time you spend at work isn't very important as long as you get the work done. It will however be very appreciated if you are - and most likely frowned upon if you aren't - willing to make extra effort when the workload is particularly important. That is, for example, just before a deadline. Again, this is from my own experience. The best you can do is figure out how things work in your company, and act accordingly. 

A viewpoint not mentioned yet: I guess there is a reason why you are leaving. Whatever it may be, I guess you are assuming that leaving improves your overal situation. Either you will be working in a better place soon, or you at least will leave an abysmal place. Either way: live is changing to the better for you! Rejoice! Let it be known far and wide that you are leaving, be happy about it. All pressure you felt in the old place has now fallen away from you. All problems the old place made you suffer through are gone. You don't need to rub it in everyones face or even tell them why exactly you are leaving (if it is a reason inside the company, they probably can take an educated guess anyways). You can always just answer "I felt that it was time for a change", which is probably a) true and sounds b) entrepeneurical. You certainly don't need to throw a party on your last day. But unless you are the underdog in your current company and fear physical harm if/when you tell them, by all means do so. 

So go to your manager and tell him you finished the project and are available for new tasks. If he gives you tasks you consider he shouldn't give you, discuss it with him. If he doesn't wanna hear it, that's unfortunate, and if it is really unbearable for you maybe it's time to look for a different job. But not liking the tasks your boss gives you is NOT an excuse for lying to him and being unprofessional 

You're not responsible for your manager being on leave. Resign politely via e-mail, possibly telling him you regret you have to do this by email and offering a phone call at his conveniance. 

That is fine with me (and obviously for OP) and much less offensive than what some of the other answers suggested. Really also quite courageous, in my opinion, and quite the correct tone to also shut up any amorous thoughts the guy might or might not be having. In general, I would have suggested a plain but friendly answer somewhat similar to this one: 

Any other answer does not fit into IT businesses. Obviously I am not talking about life-changing things here. If your boss asks you to renew the paint job in your office, you might just be a bit more rebellious. But anything remotely involving your expertise as a software developer, and this absolutely includes reviewing CVs and consulting (by the way, what you call "consulting" here is just "talking with people about stuff you know pretty well". It is not "real" consulting in the fashion that you sit down with a team of consultants to work out grand schemes of how to improve a business or whatever.). This answer is not sarcastic, by the way. If the request is absolutely outlandish, then X, Y and Z will be expensive enough for the boss to decide himself that you are the wrong person. You still were open for it. That is what counts. Also, your boss may not even be aware about X, Y and Z. By telling him, you help him, and the company as a whole. He will, likely, not forget that, and come to you for advice again and again. What now Think constructively about what X, Y and Z are needed right now to make the plan of your boss work. If your boss is, in your humble opinion, not able to handle such a project, then X will need to be "hire a project lead". If you truly feel unable to review CVs (I could not imagine why, but just to assume...), then Y could be "I need to visit a training course about People Management". If the fact that the guy will be hired by the other company bothers you so much, then make it objectively clear why that is so (for example to protect your company's rights on the software), then Z could be "hire that guy in your company, and then outsource him to the other company". I hope you see what those X, Y and Z do. If you manage to convince your boss that those X, Y and Z are necessary, then he will do the calculations. If at the end of the day it is too expensive for him, he will decide against. If he does decide to invest, then you have reached your original goal, and improved the company. (And obviously these X, Y and Z are just examples; adapt the process to your full situation.) If there are no X, Y and Z Oh. And if you do not find any X, Y and Z, then the answer is 

(pretty much summed it up in my op comment, but I thought this might be worth an actual answer). Maybe they are indeed trying to avoid wasting their time and yours if your expectations are way above their pay range. Maybe it's some kind of bargaining strategy to lower your expectations before the proper money talk begins. But if the range they give you is somewhat decent, even though not what you expected, I'd still go to the interview if I were interested in the position, because there's a chance that you really impress them and they think you're worth making an effort wit the budget.
