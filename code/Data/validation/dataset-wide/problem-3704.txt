I have just started doing Stronglifts 5x5 (which is almost the same as Starting Strength). Hopefully in say 6 months time I have made good progress, but are also starting to plateu. In order to get stronger it is then recommended to decrease sets and reps: Madcow 5x5 or The Texas Method. However at this stage I probably am not interested in getting stronger. Instead I want to maintain my strength while increasing muscular endurance. To be a bit more precise we can say that I want to maximize the weight I can do for each of the lifts in Stronglifts for 25 reps. I would say my ideal is the physique of a crossfitter. However it seems a bit intense and potentally dangerous except for very well trained, versatile and technically proficient athletes. Also their programs are quite complex. Maybe I could train almost like a crossfitter for some time first, with a simpler program, but with some of the aspects of a crossfit program. How would I train to achieve this? Is there any program you could suggest? I am aware that increasing the 1RM will increase the endurance. However 1RM calculators typically only goes to 12 reps. This indicates that strength in the 25 reps range is somewhat disconnected from max strength. I notice that in crossfit they use alternating heavy and volume days. During the volume days they do each exercise for time. Maybe I could do 3 x 1 min each exercise with as many as possible reps. Also in crossfit they seem to do circuit training. That is first 1 set of squat, then 1 set of bench, then 1 set of barbell row. Then redo this complete sequence two times. I guess this is not so easy to achieve in the gym where one typically have to wait in queue. But I could do supersets. Squat could be combined with barbell row for instance. 

There are amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins, and we get them more easily from animal sources. We can also get them, quite readily, from vegetable sources. If I have enough of certain basic amino acids, my body can synthesize certain others. What's important in your diet, and what is considered a complete protein dietary profile, is a combination of vegetable protein sources that insure you are getting all of the "essential" amino acids, that your body cannot produce itself from other amino acids. For instance, my recollection is that tofu and brown rice is an excellent combination for getting a good spectrum of essential amino acids in sufficient quantities. 

You goal should be more focused on body composition vs numerical body weight. As such, there's no reason to not do resistance or weight training. Phlegon's answer about starting with body weight resistance via what's generally considered calisthenics is a good one. That's also a way to do some of the exercises at home and build up some strength and fitness if you're at all self-conscious about the amount of weight you'd be pushing at the health club. So.... doing resistance exercises doesn't have to mean developing bulk, if that's what you're worried about. Lower weight, higher repetition sets will develop some strength, but will develop more fitness, tone and endurance, which will also help with your general stamina for your other aerobic activities. Variety is good, so why not do more types of exercise? It's better, mentally, to keep you from getting stale, and a cross section of exercises and types of exercises gives you good functional fitness, where the advantages and drawbacks of any particular exercising method even out with cross-training with other methods. 

That not only means fewer resources that are available for building muscle, but because your recovery is also compromised. 

Understand the first month neural changes not hypertrophy are responsible for your strength gains. Your nervous system is rearranging as it is acquiring new muscle activation and recruitment patterns. You're initially forming the "skill" (Notice systemic changes are typically seen first -- slightly increased vascularity, improved coordination, i.e. the lifts don't feel nearly as awkward as you get used to them). The weight you're lifting and the extent to which it's challenging for you is relative, looking at it from an absolute stanpoint 25lbs will not be inducing much if any hypertrophy. Age, genetics, diet, recovery etc, etc.... all play a huge role in how much muscle you're actually putting on. Unlike cardiovascular exercise which leads to a fairly fast and significant level of detraining (again this level is relative and depends on your baseline level of fitness). Hypertrophic gains require much less subsequent exercise to maintain (some studies show as little as once bi-weekly to maintain gains) muscle mass also takes much longer (~3x's as long) to lose once you stop completely. 

I'd recommend working with whatever weight and rep thresholds the weaker arm can manage. Doing different workouts for each will only increase the disparity between the two. Eventually, the weaker one will catch up. Since you body doesn't just work only that specific muscle, in isolation, in normal, non-dumbbell functioning, I'd think an imbalance between sides of the body could lead to other, unforeseen problems, but maybe I'm paranoid about that because I had a bit of scoliosis, as a youth, in part to an imbalance between development between the two sides. Again, there may not be a detriment, but my own bias is towards relatively equal balance, when possible. 

The "growth plate" is the area of active bone growth, and is more prone to injury than the more hardened areas of bone or the bones after that growth plate has closed. That's were any claim of stunted growth due to injury is going to come from. To the degree that a growth plate injury could effect bone growth, sure, weight lifting could effect your growth. So could walking down the street, playing soccer, or any other activity where the injury occurs. So the real question to evaluate is whether weight lifting carries an inordinately high risk of causing a growth plate injury vs other physical activities that are not deemed "unsafe." It does not. Of course, this assumes that you follow the common sense practice of performing the exercises properly, in technique, amount of weight and spotters. That's true in general to avoid injuries, though, not exclusive to this type of injury. 

I am motivated to do a bit of strength training to increase general fitness and health and fighting the sitting disease I contract at work. Looking muscular or being very strong holds little interest to me. I am looking for a minimum effort solution. Most strength programs prescribe training 2 sets of each exercise 3 times a week. Even with only 3 exercises: deadlift, squat and press this can take about 45 minutes due to long pauses between sets. My problem with this is that I find it boring. Especially the breaks between sets. Also I dislike planning and schedules and monitoring progress. I am therefore considering replacing parts or the whole program with kettlebell and dumbell exercises at home (unfortunately I do not have space for a barbell at home). This way I can do something interesting between sets. More specifically I am considering doing swing, getup and goblet squats since I consider these to be equivalents to the deadlift, press and squat. As for the planning I was considering doing e.g. one set of each everyday after work. That way it would be routine and nothing to think about. This would also eliminate the pause altogether. I think I could manage to do this using only 15 minutes. The amount of training would stay the same but the rest period would be shorter. Earlier I would think that would be a bad idea. But then I read about Greasing the Groove (GTG). Following this method one can train several times a day as long as one only do 50% of max number of reps in each set. I am also considering a hybrid approach: I go to the gym once a week and do heavy lifts. The rest of the time I workout lighter at home with the kettlebell and dumbell. One big drawback of kettlebell is clearly the difficulty in doing progressive overloads. This is easier with the dumbell(s). Any ideas on how I can combine these forms of training to get decent strength training with little effort so that I do not loose my motivation? 

Is your experience growing up that you went barefoot a lot? I did, as most of my youth was spent at swimming pools. My doctor once commented that I had "luau feet" - a wider spread that he attributed to being barefoot a lot over the years. The shoes are not designed to be narrow and constricting, they are narrow because most people, at least in the USA, have feet that are shaped like that, so they produce for the "average" foot, for better sales. There are plenty of shoes that are much wider in their design. Look for ones labeled "wide-width," or the company "New Balance" which specifically produces more of their shoes (they do running and athletic shoes) in wide size than others. Another online retailer that specializes in all varieties of wide sizes for shoes, both exercise and otherwise, is Hitchcock Shoes. Hitchcock Shoes web site Shoes should always fit comfortably, if your feet are feeling pinched, you're not wearing one that's right for you. 

I am a 44 year old male. A few days ago I managed to fall skiing downhill and hurt some ligaments in my shoulder. I have done a lot of skiing in my life and must have fallen a 100 times without hurting myself seriously. Falling and hurting oneself is something I associate with older people but for me this is coming sooner. The reason for this may be that I am tall: 192 cm and heavy: 100 kg. I understand that flexibility is very important and will adress this. Also I will lower my bodyfat percentage. What I am wondering is how my situation should influence my strength training? I have read that the fast muscle fibers are the one we loose as we get older. That seems plausible since we use the enduring ones a bit in our daily life. I would think that on impact the muscles would mobilize and brace themselves to absorb the shock. The fast ones would maybe react faster than the enduring ones? Also max force would be important. Should I aim for max strength or explosive strength? I am a bit sceptical regarding training for explosive strength since I am afraid I might hurt myself. Regarding bulk I would think that it would be best for me to add as little muscle mass as possible. I can probably loose 10 kg of fat but not much more. And I do not want to be heavy since that leads to harder impact. Unfortunately I have always had much more enduring muscle fibers than fast ones. So using say 10 reps instead of 5 have been the fastest way for me to get stronger. But now I can not afford to get bulky. I guess that means I should train with fewer reps?
