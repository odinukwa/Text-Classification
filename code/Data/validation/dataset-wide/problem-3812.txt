$\DeclareMathOperator{\Jac}{\mathrm{Jac}}\DeclareMathOperator{\Sym}{\mathrm{Sym}}$ The answer is yes. First of all let's see how to identify the tangent space of a point $[\Jac C] \in A_g$ with $\Sym^2 H^1(C,O_C)$. The 1st order deformations of an abelian variety $A$ (not necessarily preserving the polarization) are given by $H^1(A,T_A) \cong H^1(A,O_A) \otimes H^0(A,\Omega_A)^\vee$ since $T_A$ is the trivial bundle $O_A \otimes H^0(A,\Omega_A)^\vee$. (You get a trivialization of $T_A$ by translation on the group $A$, identifying each fiber canonically with the tangent space at the origin.) The map $H^1(C,\mathbb C) \to H^1(\Jac C, \mathbb C)$ is an isomorphism of Hodge structures, so for a Jacobian the latter deformation space can be rewritten as $H^1(C,O_C) \otimes H^0(C,\Omega_C)^\vee$. Serre duality (on $C$!) identifies $H^0(C,\Omega_C)^\vee$ with $H^0(C,O_C)$, so for a Jacobian the deformations can be written as $H^1(C,O_C) \otimes H^1(C,O_C)$. Finally $\Sym^2 H^1(C,O_C)$ sits inside the deformation space as the deformations preserving the polarization on $\Jac C$ (and hence the isomorphism $H^1(A,O_A)\cong H^1(A,\Omega_A)^\vee$). Now cup product defines a map $H^1(C,T_C) \otimes H^0(C,\Omega_C) \to H^1(C,O_C)$, which by dualizing gives $H^1(C,T_C) \to H^1(C,O_C) \otimes H^0(C,\Omega_C)^\vee$. The claim is that this is the differential of the Torelli map. A proof can be found in Arbarello, Cornalba, Griffiths "The geometry of algebraic curves vol. 2" in the chapter on deformation theory, section 8. Transposing and applying Serre duality gives also a map $H^0(C,\Omega_C) \otimes H^0(C,\Omega_C) \to H^0(C, \Omega_C^{\otimes 2})$ -- the codifferential of Torelli -- and what we want to show is that this map, too, is given by cup product. So what you need to know is that Serre duality is compatible with cup product maps. But this is immediate if you think of Serre duality as defined by cup products taking values in $H^1(C,\Omega_C)$ with its canonical isomorphism with $\mathbb C$ defined via the trace map. 

Sorry about the dumb title. I'd like to understand Wick's theorem. More specifically, I have seen it pop up in several different contexts and I am really puzzled by the different statements of it that I have seen. My own background/interest is in moduli of curves, if that helps. The first version, that is also the only one I have seen more than one time, is in the context of infinite wedge space. Here Wick's theorem is a formula about how to decompose any product of the fermionic operators $\psi_k$ and their adjoints $\psi_k^\ast$ as a sum over normally ordered products. This is for instance how it is explained in Kac-Raina. A second version is in "Graphs on surfaces" by Lando and Zvonkin as Theorem 3.2.5. Here it is a statement about how to integrate a polynomial against a Gaussian measure on the real line. If $\langle f \rangle$ denotes the integral $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{\mathbb R} f(x) \exp(-x^2/2) dx$, then Wick's theorem states that if f is a product $f = f_1 f_2 \cdots f_{2k}$ of linear polynomials, then $\langle f \rangle$ can be written as an explicit sum of products of pairs $\langle f_if_j\rangle$. Now I can somehow believe that the two theorems above are talking about the same thing or that the second is a special case of the first. But what really got me scratching my head was the following statement from page 2 of Getzler & Kapranov's paper on modular operads (sorry for the lengthy quote): 

Do you know Theorem 1.4 ("relative formality") of Lambrechts-Volic paper on formality of the small disks? It says that when $m \geq 2n+1$ the $\infty$-morphism is in fact a morphism and it is the obvious one (forget the bracket to get a commutative algebra, then give it bracket zero to get a Gerstenhaber/Poisson algebra with bracket in different degree). 

Under the isomorphism $\mathrm{PGSp}(4) \cong \mathrm{SO}(5)$ the Saito-Kurokawa representation corresponds to a Siegel modular form. In particular its archimedean component is in the holomorphic discrete series, so it is tempered. All non-archimedean components are non-tempered. Also, yes: supercuspidal implies discrete series implies tempered. 

If $f \colon C \to C'$ is a dominant morphism of smooth projective curves, there is a norm map $f_\ast = \mathrm{Nm} \colon JC \to JC'$ between their Jacobians, and we can consider the abelian subvariety $Z = (\ker \mathrm{Nm})^0$ and the polarization on $Z$ induced from $JC$. In two particularly interesting cases this polarization is twice a principal polarization $\Xi$, namely when $f$ has degree two and is either unramified or has two ramification points. In this case, one calls the ppav $(Z,\Xi)$ the Prym variety of $f$. This construction works just as well in families, so it defines morphisms between some moduli spaces. If $R_g$ denotes the moduli space of smooth genus $g$ curves $C'$ and an unramified connected double cover $C \to C'$, one gets a Prym map $R_g \to A_{g-1}$. Here $A_g$ is the moduli space of dimension $g$ principally polarized abelian varieties. This map is rather well studied (e.g. the papers of Beauville, Donagi-Smith, Donagi and too many others to mention here). On the other hand, one could also let $R_{g,2}$ be the moduli space of smooth genus $g$ curves with a double cover with two branch points. One gets in the same way a Prym map $R_{g,2} \to A_g$. But I have never seen any paper dealing with the properties of this map; maybe this is because of my incomplete knowledge of the literature. (One reason it may be less interesting is that unlike the ordinary Prym map in genus six, this one should never be generically finite for any $g$.) Here are for instance some natural questions about this map: Is it dominant when $g \leq 4$? If yes, what is the structure of the generic fiber? Is it generically injective when $g \geq 5$? Does it extend to a compactification $\overline R_{g,2}$ using admissible covers, either by mapping to the Satake compactification or to a toroidal compactification like the 2nd Voronoi? Is any of this known? 

You are asking about $s_3 \circ s_{1^p}$. Recall that there is an involution $\omega$ on the ring of symmetric functions for which $\omega(s_\lambda) = s_{\lambda'}$ (conjugate partition). We use results from Macdonald's Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials: By Chapter 1, ยง8, Example 1, $ \omega( s_3 \circ s_{1^p})$ equals $s_3 \circ s_p$ if $p$ is even and $s_{1^3} \circ s_p$ if $p$ is odd. Both these plethysms are given completely explicitly in Example 9(b) in the same section, note that $s_p=h_p$ and $s_{1^p} = e_p$. Your suspicion that there are no summands with only two columns (i.e. only two rows, after applying $\omega$) is incorrect for all $p>1$. 

I think the situation you are looking for is when $\mathcal F$ is a local system. If $F$ is a locally constant sheaf on $X$, say of $\mathbf C$-vector spaces, then you can put $\mathcal F = F \otimes_\mathbf{C} \mathcal O$ to get a holomorphic vector bundle, which is canonically equipped with a flat connection $$ \nabla : \mathcal F \to \Omega^1 \otimes \mathcal F$$ such that $F = \mathrm{ker}(\nabla)$. Flatness means that when you extend $\nabla$ to a map $\Omega^d \otimes \mathcal F \to \Omega^{d+1}\otimes \mathcal F$ then $\nabla \circ \nabla = 0$, so you get a complex of sheaves $\Omega^\bullet \otimes \mathcal F$. The hypercohomology $\mathbb H^i(X,\Omega^\bullet \otimes \mathcal F)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology $H^i(X,F)$, which is a purely topological object ($F$ is just a complex representation of $\pi_1(X)$). 

My first advice is to stop worrying about what progression you should be learning stuff. Just read things you find interesting, and if you find yourself reading something that makes no sense to you then you can start backtracking and looking at prerequisites. You don't need to plan ahead so much. Anyway, I second the recommendation of the book of Mac Lane and Moerdijk. Also, I don't think it sounds absurd to study category theory without having a background in set theory/logic. Most people who know a lot of category theory do not, either; I would say most applications of category theory are in topology/algebraic geometry and related areas. But there are also logicians (as you mention), computer scientists, mathematical physicists, and many others that apply category theory in their work. Finally, there's a big risk your question is going to closed. Don't take it personally, it's just a bit too discussion-y to be a great fit for the MO "format".
