Termites 'eat wood' by passing the raw cellulose to symbiotic bacteria in their gut to turn this into sugars. A human could in theory be changed to do something similar with these bacteria. The body could then digest the raw sugars as normal. Rocks are harder, because there is no lifeform that metabolizes rock for fuel, and the relative hardness would make it difficult to work with even if you found some energy releasing reaction. Plus, biologically just releasing heat is not enough - it has to be a reaction that can be controlled step by step in the context of the body's cells to release energy as needed. Our bodies aren't the kind that can work off explosions like an internal combustion engine. 

Jerry Pournelle wrote a novel "King David's Spaceship" about a lower tech world scratching together a spaceship launch in order to get better terms when added to a space Empire as a 'space faring nation'. This was a case of tech lost due to wars rather than true medieval, but it has similar aspects you can learn from. 

Another alternative is to just have multiple cities built, and move the population to and fro in a convoy of tent-wagons. I'm not sure why a dragon can't just follow the moving city 10 miles, though. 

It seems that most answers are taking for granted a couple of new jobs that a space station requires: Air supply: If this runs out, everybody dies. There has to be a large staff watching this like a hawk. 24-7. Heating/Cooling: Outside temperatures range from well about 100 degrees to -100. This can never get to the guests. Designs would need to include monitoring and fast response servicing. Fire department: Must be increased massively, as if a fire gets out of control everyone dies. Evacuation: You can't just have everyone go out front on a fire drill. You need lifeboats and pilots and techs for them. 

You could have a society that does this without too much difference in thought if the species has a life cycle that has several metamorphoses along the way. So consider a sentient butterfly like critter. 

One of the few examples I know of where a partyless Democracy was formed was the the Confederate States of America. Everyone was experienced in Democratic processes, had worked in a more or less identical system for decades. In addition, they had the fact that they were at war to survive as a nation to focus their efforts. These members were all from the Democratic Party, and from the pro-slavery wing at that. Nevertheless, within a few years they were having knife fights between members in Congress. When you ban parties, you only have personalities to contend with, which is an even more poisonous situation by far. Your restrictions on political speech, if honestly adhered to, cripple any means to tie an incumbent to his record. The system rewards the creation of a few safe seats to dominate the legislature far, far worse than any seniority system. At least the entrenched fat cat in current systems has one vote, not a quarter million. My country has had a democracy for 200 years and more and I think your voting system is bizzarely complicated. In a state where there are no parties at all, and no voting tradition, and no legal public dissent setting up a few big winners in districts as the arbiters of the country is asking for trouble. 

Planets will normally orbit a star in the same plane as its own rotation. This cuts down the area you need to search. If you are parked in the habitable zone, a planet will be in the top 20 or so brightest objects visible in the entire sky, so finding one or more in the ecliptic is a giveaway. Once you spot them, watching them over a few days will show their motion, and thus their orbit. 

The most reasonable way to get an open sea around the North Pole surrounded by colder areas is to have a warm current, like the Gulf Stream, be diverted into the Polar regions rather than be allowed to turn and head south again. Parts of the actual Gulf Stream reach as far North as the northern tip of Scandinavia and warm those waters. A larger and more directed stream might be tuned to deliver enough warm water to the Arctic Ocean to keep the ocean free of an ice cap. 

The moon would be a pretty big clue. It wouldn't be there. The moon isn't really captured by the Earth, they are both co-planets in the same orbit. At no point is the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the Moon stronger than that of the Sun. So unless this phenomenon was placed to take the moon along too, it would be missing and apparent from the start. EDIT: I got this line of reasoning from the 1962 essay "Just Mooning Around" by Isaac Asimov where he calculates the "true moon band" from the Roche Limit (where tides break up the moon) to where Solar gravity dominates to be from 9600 - 29,000 miles. Yet the source for 'zone of influence' comes up with a range of some 500,000 miles. So I still hold that the Earths' influence on the Moon gravitationally is particularly weak and more likely to be disturbed by your average planet snatching device unless great care was taken to avoid it. 

The major cost in moving freight around the Solar System is fighting the gravity wells of planets. Moving material from the asteroid belt to Earth orbit is relatively cheap in terms of fuel, if you have the technology. Dragging material from the Earth's surface is expensive, as is dragging it down to the surface. If the idea is to bring the material to Earth's surface, the cost will probably be prohibitive. The advantage would come if you needed it in Earth orbit. 

There is a certain value in specializing your efforts. The main advantage of a horse is speed. A cow or oxen might be stronger or more durable, which is why they are used to draw carts and plows at times, but even there horses are preferred. Horses are more nimble than cattle, so are more likely to be able to work in difficult terrain. In a battle, you might as well skip the cattle and use infantry. Speed is equivalent, or better. Men are far more reliable than any animal, and can handle rough terrain. So if you are going to train animals for mounted use, it is far better to use the best animal for the job. There's nothing a cow-rider can do that men on foot can't do just as well. 

A point to consider is that most cities do not spring to life all at once, but grow organically. There is a small settlement, or several in the area of a large city. These grow into small towns. As the city grows, the small towns are absorbed but the lines and roads of the original town are still there. This can be repeated several times as the site grows, with settlements around the area at river crossings growing to towns, then some towns growing to small cities and then the area between is filled in as the major city grows. But you still see echoes of these old centers on the map. 

It could not happen for a standard planetary ring that is in orbit, due to drag. But it isn't impossible to form a structure that appears to be a ring from entities floating in the atmosphere, not in orbit. For example, a titanic number of zeppelins flying about en-masse over the equator at various altitudes, using their motors to avoid being scattered. If the gasbags were reflective, it might look impressive from a distance. Why people would want such a thing is another question. 

In the Middle Ages, Pilgrimages to Holy Sites were a big deal. There were travelers' aid stations and many were interested in helping poor pilgrims get where they are going. If they are willing to mix the travel with a pilgrimage (our noble heroes would never lie about being a pilgrim) they could save quite a bit of money at the expense of speed. 

According to Ludwig von Mises, there is one serious structural problem to any socialist society: economic calculation. In a society with no money and no free trade, how does the society set a value to any particular item? So in a socialist society, I make a TV. How many hours, or days, of value did I contribute that my compensation comes from. On the next day, I make a sculpture made of cow poo. What about that? In a society with a market, well, I soon find out if someone values my TV more or my cow poo. Or maybe nobody values either one and I get nothing! Eventually, though, I learn and either become a full time cow poo or TV maker. And if tastes change, the results I get change. In a socialist world with no markets and no money, some authority must set a value with no idea of what anyone else will or will not value. If they guess wrong, they run the risk of producing too much cow poo and too little TVs, or the reverse. And with no way to measure effects, theres no reason to change a decision made, except for the whim of the value-setter. 

Here's an explanation... The dungeon is a window into multiple dimensions. If someone enters a room that is empty, there is a chance it will close the door, stopping time until an adventurer in some other dimension reopens the room and tries to kill you for loot. So in this model, there are no monsters at all...just all the greedy adventurers being trapped for others of their like to discover and kill. Like a Venus Fly Trap for Dungeon Delvers. 

Rather than fight a tank strength on strength and losing, attack the weakness of the tank. Tank engines need air intakes. Men inside need air intakes. If the plant is fragile, and emits lots of pollen or dust, the air intakes will suck that up right into the filters, which will clog. The tank then needs to stop, clean or replace the filter, and start again. A dozen feet later, it all happens again. 

This seems like an unlikely setup. The full growth of a city requires a certain amount of security. A Fortress City on a border has defense requirements that stunt its full growth, as everything needs to fit in the walls all the time. A city deeper in, away from the border but connected by roads to several forts can grow faster at need and the populace can be more confident they won't all die. It also seems odd that these border cities are also on the coast. This means there is no protected farmland to grow food for them. In reality you would have port cities on the coast, and smaller forts distributed inland to give a secure border for the land. There might, or might not be cities in the middle, depending. 

You might want to look at the continents on earth that actually have large grasslands for comparison. Eurasia - temperate zone, prevailing winds from the west. No major barrier mountains, but once you get several hundred miles from the coast into Hungary and the Ukraine the grasslands start up. North America - temperate zone, prevailing winds from the west/south in summer. Mountains block water from the west, but the Gulf winds in summer bring moisture from the southeast without any barriers. Once you get several hundred miles from the coasts, grasslands become prevalent to dominant - the Great Plains. 

The main reason for making a siege impractical is pretty prosaic. Logistics. An army contains a lot of men and horses. These need to be fed. A lot. A decent sized army is about the same scale as one of the larger cities in the realm, and it moves around. Your supply men will have to find supplies, and wagons to carry them, and extra food and fodder to feed the men and horses pulling the wagons to boot. Then you have to continue doing this every day as long as the siege lasts. For all but the most organized societies, this just is impossible to accomplish. So it is assault, or give up and go away. 

There is one "simple" way...simply pile on the mass of Hydrogen. Large stars burn hotter, and much faster than midsize or small stars, and reach the end of lifetime quicker. How to add 10 solar masses of Hydrogen is left as an exercise for the reader. 

Your option A is very like a matrilineal society, such as the Iroquois had. However, the head of the family was not a woman, but the oldest brother. Men born in a family did not all stay - many moved over to their wives family when wed, at least for a time, to sire children there. If men remained in that household, they could only marry their sisters. If other women arrived for them, the family would have its blood diluted with other women's. So one of your ideas has to go. Women would need to have several children, so that the brother would have a set of sisters to use as partners for the extension of the family, even if he cares nothing for his own blood children, who would be in another tribe. 

Adults lay eggs and forget about them. Caterpillars and other transitional forms survive on their own. Culling happens as usual. A chrysalis forms and attracts the attention of the adults, who collect them and care for them. These are the "babies" of adult society and are nurtured from birth and educated. 

Make them hermaphrodites, with both male and female parts on all individuals. You have the advantages of sexual reproduction, without two genders. 

No he cannot rule the galaxy. He might be able to kill everyone in it, but otherwise he has now way to enforce any decision he makes. Any leaving of his ship could result in his death - he's not immortal and invulnerable outside his ship. If planets, or other ships ignore him, he might kill them, but that is all the effect he can have. Any other edicts could be ignored hoping that he will tire of killing things without result. 

You could also have a reason that is much like the friction between the American Indians and the European Settlers. Land use by men is just so much different that there is a fundamental difference between how the humans use the land and, say the elves. Men cut down trees, farm, and hunt in their way and Elves do it another. These don't mix, and the Elves decided to move on rather than fight or argue. Possibly races like Dwarves might have similar issues, or move along with the Elves because they trade with Elves and they form a social unit. This physical separation would reduce the contact to virtually nothing, and if the human population isn't growing expansion would not bring them back into contact. 

The problem with this requirement for a 1% temperature uniformity on a planetary scale is that heat conducts slowly relative to the size of a planet. Conduction, winds, you name whatever temperature balancing mechanic you wish to name and it will take time to move the temperature away from high noon at the equator to midnight at one of the poles. All of the energy sources to a planet are point sources (vulcanism) or solar (incident from one direction). This gives an innate directional component to your heating that playing games with two stars just isn't going to fix. There have been times when the climate on earth was more uniform than the present - in the age of the Dinosaurs alligators and turtles were found even in high latitudes. But three degrees at all times just isn't possible. 

Historically, non magical realms like the northern parts of the USA found it easy to abolish slavery within a single human lifetime. At the start of our nation, all or nearly all states had slavery. When the urge struck, the usual way of handling it was to set a target date that stated that anyone born after that date would be free, not slave. Thus without taking any assets from a citizen, slaves would vanish from the state. Similarly, you could set a distance date when any remaining slaves would be freed. This would give anyone plenty of time to sell slaves elsewhere if freeing them was objectionable. Peer pressure coupled with these laws made it painless at a societal level as long as the proportion of ex-slaves to free is small, even with the racial basis of slavery in the US. The breakdown in the US came when states forsaw that they would have a high to very high level of ex-slaves in their state if emancipation came and no way to get rid of them elsewhere. This was what led to sectional strife.
