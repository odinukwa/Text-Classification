The Imperial supply chain for Russian America went over land through Okhotsk. Officials communicating with the various headquarters in St. Petersburg traveled there by way of Iakutsk and Irkutsk. For the transit of goods or persons, how long did this trip take? 

Spanish colonies in the Californias, created in part to forestall Russian expansion, were militarily weak. The military had only a few hundred men in the whole territory, and no ships at all. It was easily outgunned by the two insurgent ships that sacked and burned the capital, Monterey, in 1818. Spain had always had too much going on to invest in developing California. Enter Russia. It had been expanding eastwards by conquering local societies as it went. Once the empire reached the Pacific Ocean, the Russian-American Company was formally permitted to settle Alaska. It established colonies there, which were perennially short of food, contributing to their eventual sale to the United States. Spanish officials took fright and monitored Russian encroachment, but were unable or unwilling to oppose the installation of Russia's outpost Fort Ross. After the Napoleonic Wars ended, Russia sponsored several dozen long-range voyages. Officials of the Imperial Navy on round-the-world trips and Russian-American Company ships from Sitka both made contacts throughout California. Several of the Russian visitors who wrote up their experiences noticed the province's inadequate defenses; some, especially Dmitry Zavalishin, suggested that Russia should acquire California. The Russian-American Company could not have sponsored an invasion nor a settlement of California, but the Imperial Russian Navy could have. This acquisition could have solved the problem of provisionment to the Russian Pacific rim and dramatically expanded Russia's sphere of influence. Spain would not have found out for many months, and would have had trouble retaliating since three viceroyalties were in revolution at once, including the one from which any reinforcements for California would have to be sent. For all its vaunted navy could do, Spain was about to lose nearly all its colonies; Russia was not. Independent Mexico wasn't about to be able to defend California either; there wasn't much of a fight when the United States sent a few ships to take over. Aware of Zavalishin's advocacy, and already possessing one outpost in the area, Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I could have taken California for Russia between approximately 1815-1845. Why didn't they? 

As Ben Crowell observed above, while the missions produced grain and legumes, the rancho economy was extremely focused on cattle production. Californios were rich in products made from leather, tallow, and beef. Meat was often wasted after slaughter, left to rot on the bone, or boiled up in tallowmaking. They had so much beef they could have made a great profit selling it to the Russians, if they had arranged better salt production. It seems safe to say that Californio households were eating their fill of beef. 

The Coast Redwood and the Giant Sequoia are related, massive, long-living softwood trees growing on the west coast of North America. Their wood is straight, resistant to pests, and easily splittable, but they take centuries to mature. Specimens may exceed five meters in diameter and a gigagram in mass. Widespread exploitation of the trees began with Anglo-Americans immigrating and building sawmills around the 1840s. Many of the few remaining specimens are now protected in parks. Minimal tools and technique are needed to cut down a young redwood, but harvesting a mature one and transporting its wood, even in pieces, is dangerous and technical. Besides gigantic saws, it can take wedges, sledgehammers, drills, platforms, and maybe more. When did the large trees become possible to harvest and handle? Is it known who was the first to cut down a mature one? 

The Gregorian, and indeed the Roman, Egyptian, and Chinese calendars all include occasional intercalary periods to make up the 0.24 of a solar day that is left over when using a 365-day calendar. These systems count solar years more accurately than the Mayan calendar. The Tzolk'in at 260 days seems unrelated to the solar year; the Haab''s length of 365 days does seem related. However, in neither case were intercalary periods added. Doing so could complicate calculations with the Calendar Round. Maintaining continuity was a reason to stick with the inaccurate Haab'. According to David Bolles, in "The Mayan Calendar, The Solar - Agricultural Year, and Correlation Questions": 

Writing this answer would not have been possible without Brian Z's reference to the ships' frequency and user2448131's contribution that they were called avisos. Thank you both. 

Elizabeth ruled from 1741 to 1762, when the sea route between Bolsheryetesk and Okhotsk was already open. What was the old book? Is this story factual? 

Upton Sinclair's work put him in the vanguard of several historiographical movements: people's history, muckraking, and undercover journalism. His attention to common people's experiences seems to be overshadowed by the memory of his seminal acts of journalism. 

Despite the clarity of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on this topic, Mexican land grants in Alta California were subject to drawn-out legal battles in the American period. Most Californios lost their ranchos owing to factors like a lack of detail in old official records, aggressive squatting by newcomers they could not afford to eject, and loan sharking. English speakers with close connections to the newly dominant Americans, like grantees Timothy Murphy and Joseph Majors, were relatively better prepared to defend their land interests. Did any of the Californio families succeed in holding on to their rancho until, say, 1900? 

Modern swiveling office chairs almost universally have five wheels on five legs, while vintage chairs often have only four. The fifth wheel adds a lot of stability against tipping over; the physics and geometry of this arrangement must have been obvious quite a long time ago. This related question on a sister site shows that the change was in place by the 1980s, as well as naming reasons motivating it. When did the fifth wheel and leg become normalized in the manufacture of office chairs? 

In the 1700s and early 1800s, how many criminal exiles were sent all the way to Kamchatka? I can name only Benyovsky. 

In 1818 the Chief Manager of the Russian-American Company, Hagemeister, wrote to his subordinate manager Potorochin: 

Leontii A. Hagemeister (or Gagemeister) was a Baltic German navigator of the Russian navy and briefly governor of the Russian-American company. The best work on him in English is by Richard Pierce, whose Builders of Alaska repackages 1970s work saying that Hagemeister's journals remained unstudied: "One difficulty for the scholar is that he kept his diaries in Russian, German, English, Spanish, French and Portuguese." Pierce did not mention where the documents were kept, and I haven't succeeded in finding out. Which archive holds Hagemeister's diaries? 

Without assuming that these cases share the same explanations, what factors or concerns in native Hawaiian culture could help to explain all these references to arson? 

According to James R. Gibson's "Feeding the Russian Fur Trade", supply ships from Okhotsk visited Petropavlovsk in this period annually around October. 

George Lensen's "The Russian Push Toward Japan", 1959, cites Okamoto Ryunosuke, "Nichi-Ro kosho Hokkaido shiko", 1898, to say: 

I conclude that the Heracleum liquor was the product of Kamchadal foraging and Russian distilling practices. Whether anyone is still making this product today, I hope to learn in a comment. 

Colonizers of the Americas often paid natives for work in food, and justified the certainty in doing so as an improvement over the supposedly hazardous, unpredictable lifestyle those natives previously led. For example, Fermin Francisco de Lasuén wrote that mission neophytes "are sure of daily sustenance, when before they lived from hand to mouth." Of course, the native societies were relatively stable. People could could call on a range of resources and social networks as needed. Was there a real risk of deprivation or starvation in those native societies, before they were disrupted? 

During the Imperial era, quality transport for Russian officials was riding in a horse-drawn open carriage called a droshky. The one pictured below has springs on each wheel, providing a much smoother ride than an unsprung vehicle would. 

Nonetheless, Wikipedia indicates that Earl Granville succeeded Lansdowne as Leader of the Whig Party in the House of Lords. His tenure ended with the initiation of the Liberal project in 1859, when the Whig Party was apparently abandoned. Seating charts which I could not find might yet reveal which parliamentary groups were present in a given year. Two apparently figurative uses of "Whig" appear in the titles of in the book The Last of the Whigs: A Political Biography of Lord Hartington, Later Eighth Duke of Devonshire (1833-1908) and the article The Last Whig: Lord Hartington as Liberal Leader, 1875-80. 

I wrote to some public-inquiry offices of the UK Parliament and received a statement attributed to Alistair Cooke, Baron Lexden, historian of the Conservative Party: 

The use of 60 as a number base is due to the Babylonians. (Where did the 24 come from?) Perhaps the only modern alternative is Decimal time. 

I learned that in US law the property undergoes partition when a co-owner demands it or a judge orders it. When titles to Rancho Soquel land were being disputed in court in 1863, Third District Court Judge Samuel B. McKee commissioned a referee to ascertain ownership shares, who in turn commissioned a survey. The judge then ordered the ranch to be partitioned and another set of referees drew the map of the new lots. (The Castros of Soquel by Ronald Powell, pp. 271) 

Annick Foucrier's "Sailors, Carpenters, Vineyardists" describes a divorce taking place in Santa Cruz shortly after California became part of the United States, dissolving the marriage of Maria Lucia del Carmen Bolcoff and Pierre Richard. Paperwork was filed in 1847 and the divorce was granted in 1852. Did any other civil divorce in the U.S. state of California predate it? (I presume, but am not sure, that the Catholic authorities of Spanish and Mexican period Alta California did not grant divorces.) 

The Japanese and Spanish did business in the Philippines from the 12th and 16th centuries respectively. In Russia, Vasili III became aware that the Spanish had reached America after his envoys returned from Madrid in 1525. A few decades later Spain began the Manila galleon trade. Russian awareness of Japan itself began in the 17th century (George Lensen: The Russian Push Towards Japan, pp. 22). When did the Philippine archipelago and the Japanese and Spanish trade routes there become known in Russia? 

Yes. In the 1980s, the Ndebele minority that was so mistreated by Shona-controlled ZANU-PF supported the ZAPU, and "...there has always been a strong contingent of Ndebele in the senior ranks of the MDC." More recently, MDC Chairman Morgan Tsvangirai has spoken forcefully in Matabeleland, the Ndebele homeland, against the ZANU-PF violence. The MDC and its offshoot MDC-T have continued to control Bulawayo, the chief city of Matabeleland. Welshman Ncube was Youth Chairman of ZAPU, and Gibson Sipanda was its Secretary for Welfare. Both later served in Parliament for MDC. 

Peter the Great modernized Imperial Russia, reforming both its army and navy. He was keen to catch up with other European powers and built the Baltic port Kronstadt, a shipyard at Arkhangelsk, and the empire's first navy base at Taganrog. By Peter's time, ships from Castile/Spain, England, Portugal, and Holland had already circumnavigated the globe. The Admiralty cartographer Fedor Soymonov recommended that Peter send a Siberian expedition to open trade with the Philippines and America, which didn't happen, though Peter did send Vitus Bering on his first expedition from Okhotsk around Kamchatka. I'm not sure whether this was preliminary to another trip that Peter would have sponsored had he lived longer. The first Russian voyage around the world, that of Krusenstern, took place most of a century after Peter's death. Is there evidence that Peter hoped, tried, or intended to sponsor a circumnavigation? 

Kilroy was a visual meme drawn by soldiers in WWII. He may have been derived from a British figure named Chad, though many other explanations are out there. One of the claims as to the origin of his name was given by a Mr. Kilroy. 

The Russian-American Company (head office: St. Petersburg) monopolized transit and commerce with the Russian American colonies and outposts. Almost the only people carried on Company voyages were employees, a few of which deserted, or attempted to desert, in California. How did the Company respond to employee desertion? 

Judson A. Grenier's "Officialdom": California State Government, 1849-1879 describes the laws passed in California's first Legislature of 1850. Each county would have its own assessor, and property tax was set at "50 cents on each $100 worth of taxable property", or 0.5% per annum. 

Food was scarce in all of Kamchatka, and often rotted on the way there. While Koselev devoted a lot of resources to developing agriculture, it did not work well even in the more favorable Kamchatka River valley. Foraging roots, berries, and grasses was a major part of locals' diets, but the single most significant ingredient was salmon, eaten during most of the year as jerky, yukola. Probably the prisoners were fed a starvation diet. Possibly, while Khlebnikov was imprisoned, he was forced to work in the local saltworks. In 1794 it was operated by twenty men, probably exiled prisoners guarded and goaded by soldiers of the ostrog. Imprisonment in mainland Siberia was more practical, so most exiles were sent there instead. In 1807, Khlebnikov and Koselev spent a day together in Ichinsk. My primary source for this answer was James R. Gibson's "Feeding the Russian Fur Trade". 

The degree to which Panama sought its own independence from Colombia / Gran Colombia may pale next to the interests of the U.S. in separating it. In other words, Panamanian independence from Colombia was largely a U.S. project to protect its Canal interests. 

In its Mexican era California attracted immigrants, principally Anglo-Americans, who often worked as merchants and capitalists. English speakers like William Hartnell and Thomas Larkin dominated trading activities. Also surrendered in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was the longer-established colony of New Mexico, which after 1830 provided a substantial flow of trade goods to California. Traders generations before Antonio Armijo may even have reached the Pacific Ocean (see The baffling case of New Mexican traders along the California coast prior to 1769). New Mexico was also a refuge from the Inquisition for Sephardic Crypto-Jews. About four times more populous than California, New Mexico was nonetheless isolated by geography. The contemporaneous dominance of immigrants in commerce in California and, I believe, Texas, prompts this question: before Guadalupe Hidalgo, was there also a community of non-Hispanic immigrants in New Mexico? 

Yuri Semyonov's The Conquest of Siberia says the main motivation for the Russian empire's eastwards expansion was the acquisition of furs (in the form of yasak, the fur tax assessed on native male subjects). Geopolitics was a relatively minor concern; no other power was rapidly expanding towards Russian territory, and the imperial military was in any case often occupied with wars in Europe. Of course, the empire also had a state religion: the Orthodox church, which midway through the era of expansion, suffered a schism. Did it provide doctrinal justification for the conquest? Could it afford to missionize the new territory? Did the creation of Siberian dioceses such as the bishopric of Irkutsk change church politics? 

The Franciscan priests at California missions were empowered with the faculties to perform sacraments like baptism and marriage. A stricter standard applied in the case of the faculty of confirmation -- that it be performed by bishops. California's bishop was inaccessibly far away in Sonora. In the era of Serra and Lasuen the priests enjoyed a faculty of confirmation which somehow expired in 1795. Payeras complained about its twenty-five year absence in 1820. Was the faculty ever granted again before the diocese of Monterey was created in 1840? 

That said, the Maya calendar does seem more precise than the Gregorian one. Finding the number of days that elapsed between two dates is easier without leap days. 

A paper from 1923 called The Odyssey of Thomas Muir (Marjorie Masson and J. F. Jameson) describes the episode. Among the people forced ashore, one died, one escaped to Guayaquil, a few stayed in Mexico and a few were sent on to Havana. NB, If anyone can yet show what happened to those last people sent towards Spain, I will accept their answer over this one. Muir was "transported" to Australia after being convicted in Edinburgh of circulating the work of Thomas Paine. Port Jackson is Sydney Harbour, where Dorr let Muir and two servants board clandestinely. A handful of others also managed to get on board with less intrigue. When the Otter and Sutil met in Nootka, Captain Dorr, with uncomfortably many people aboard, gave Captain Tovar five sailors in exchange for provisions, and Muir also got onto the Sutil. Both ships stopped separately in California. Muir had a nice visit with Governor Borica and continued to San Blas, where Tovar was arrested and dismissed for bringing him. Muir lost an eye when the ship bringing him to Cadiz was attacked by a British squadron. Still a political case, Muir died in poverty in Paris. Borica sold Dorr provisions but would not let him disembark anyone. Then, on subsequent nights, Dorr put ashore five and six people at gunpoint: 

Other than provide confession to mariners, what did a naval chaplain like Fernández do? Given that reference to a specific ship, would the chaplain have served on voyages as well as in port?
