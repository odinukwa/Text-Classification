where v is the vector [0, 0, ... 0, 1]. I'm pretty sure it'd be easy to prove this inductively, as A itself has a similar block structure - though I confess I haven't done it. EDIT: Here's the sage code that produces the matrix. Obviously it's not the smartest way to go about doing things, but it was adequate. If anyone knows a smarter but equally terse way of iterating over the power set than converting it to a list, let me know! 

I think it's a typo. It's probably rather more common than other typos, because the letters "t,h,g" are very close to each other on a standard keyboard. As a result, it actually does appear in the literature rather more often than you'd expect, and always without definition. (As such, I believe this post qualifies as a legitimate research question and shouldn't be closed, despite the fact that it's about a trivial typographical error. Hilarious!) For instance, here it is in a google books search result. It appears in the second page of an article in a collection of proceedings of a conference, without any definition. Elsewhere in the article it seems to be talking about orthogonality. Of course I'd be happy to be proven wrong - probably the best thing to do is to contact someone who's used the word in print. Maybe they know what it means. Edit: More evidence: compare the title to that of the pdf link, Also this: where the previous sentence uses the word "orthogonal") 

$$\Delta(\mathbf{t}) = \mathbf{t}\otimes 1 + 1\otimes\mathbf{t},\quad \Delta(A) = A\otimes 1 + 1\otimes A;$$ 

Edit: I originally asked this question on MSE, but migrated it to MO after a long period of inactivity and a recommendation from another user. 

The Drinfeld associator $\Phi(x_0, x_1)$ encodes the parallel transport of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) connection $\nabla$ on the bundle $\mathbb{C}\langle\langle x_0, x_1\rangle\rangle$ of formal power series in noncommutating variables $x_0, x_1$ over $X:=\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})\backslash\left\{0,1,\infty\right\}$. Writing $$\omega_0=\frac{dz}{z}, \quad \omega_1 = \frac{dz}{1-z},$$ we can express the KZ connection as $$\nabla = d-\omega_{KZ}$$ where $\omega_{KZ}\in\Omega^1(X)\otimes\mathbb{C}\langle x_0, x_1\rangle$ is the ''connection form'' $$\omega_{KZ} = x_0\omega_0 + x_1\omega_1.$$ The Drinfeld associator $\Phi(x_0,x_1)\in\mathbb{C}\langle\langle x_0, x_1\rangle\rangle$ (sometimes called KZ associator) is the result of analytically continuing a global horizontal section of $\nabla$ taking the asymptotic value $1$ at $z=0$ along the ''straight line path'' $\text{dch}(t)=t$, $0 < t < 1$. In other words, it is the parallel transport along $\text{dch}$. It can be expressed using iterated integrals as $$\Phi(x_0,x_1) = 1 + \int_{\text{dch}}\omega_{KZ} + \int_{\text{dch}}\omega_{KZ}\omega_{KZ}+\dots$$ It is well-known (e.g. see Lemma 4.2 of Brown's Iterated integrals in quantum field theory) that the coefficients of the Drinfeld associator are multiple zeta values (MZVs). Specifically, we can write $$\Phi(x_0,x_1) = \sum_{w \text{ word in } x_0, x_1}\zeta(w)w$$ where $\zeta(w)$ is the ''shuffle-regularised'' MZV such that $$\zeta(x_0^{k_1-1}x_1\dots x_0^{k_n-1}x_1) = \zeta(k_1, \dots,k_n), \quad \zeta(x_0) = \zeta(x_1)=0.$$ (This depends on your conventions for writing iterated integrals etc.) The inverse of the Drinfeld associator (as power series in noncommuting variables) is $$\Phi(x_1,x_0) = \Phi(x_0,x_1)^{-1}.$$ I take this to mean $$\Phi(x_1,x_0) = \sum_{w \text{ word in } x_0, x_1}\zeta(\overline{w})w$$ where $\overline{w}$ denotes $w$ with $x_0$ and $x_1$ swapped, and the zeta value requires shuffle-regularising. 

It seems to me you should be able to work out a formula for $p_{ij}$ explicitly, by solving that system of linear equations you wrote down. More to the point, you can do this before deciding on what algorithm you're going to use to assign the ranks. For this solution to correspond to a real-world solution to your problem, it seems to me that the matrix $P = (p_{ij})$ ought to be doubly stochastic (its rows and columns should sum to 1), because everyone should get a rank, and every rank should get a person. If this doesn't happen, you're out of luck. Once you've done this, your doubly stochastic matrix $P$ can be expressed as a convex combination of permutation matrices (this is the Birkhoff-Von Neumann theorem). Each of these permutation matrices corresponds to a rank assignment. You should be able to come up with your algorithm, then, by finding a constructive proof of Birkhoff-Von Neumann and realizing it with code. I sort of doubt that this would be efficient without further cleverness, but it might be a place to start. 

Archimedes might have tried to bound the arclength of the $i$th whorl of the spiral between the circumferences of two circles (of radii $ki$ and $k(i+1)$). If you consistently take, say, the lower bound, or the upper bound, or any sensible weighted average of the two, then you're adding a constant amount of arclength with each whorl. The particle can traverse this extra length in the same time by accelerating uniformly. Of course, this isn't completely accurate, as mentioned by Aaron Meyerowitz in the comments. But as the angle between the tangent vectors to the spiral and to the circle decreases, the error approaches zero. Archimedes was fairly comfortable handling the error intuitively in limiting arguments like this, as far as I know. But this is a boring story. I prefer to imagine that one day Archmedes carefully cut an unrolled papyrus scroll in half along one of its diagonals (either on a whim, or out of frustration with the math that he'd been trying to write on it). When the halves are rolled back up, they're approximately parabolic in cross-section. He would have instantly recognized the parabola, after all that time he spent cutting cones in half. I don't know whether Archimedes knew that the parabola is the curve of constant acceleration, though. 

As an example of what I mean by ''simple formula'', I originally thought perhaps $$\Phi(x_1,x_0)=\sum_{w} (-1)^{\text{weight}(w)}\zeta(w)w, \quad \text{weight}(w) := \text{length of } w.$$ However this is not correct, because we know that $\zeta(2)=\zeta(x_0 x_1) = -\zeta(x_1 x_0)$ (using shuffle-regularisation). I expect that some formula would use the path-reversal formula for iterated integrals (because we are now integrating along $\text{dch}^{-1}$) and perhaps the change of variables $z\mapsto 1-z$ on $X$. 

Let $X$ be a complex elliptic curve and $e$ the identity element of $X$. Let $E^\times$ denote the punctured curve $X\backslash\left\{e\right\}$. In their 2007 paper Towards Multiple Elliptic Polylogarithms, Levin and Racinet compute the de Rham fundamental group $\pi_1 ^{dR} (E^\times, e)$. To do this they prove that there is an equivalence of categories (Theorem 1) $$R\mathsf{-NMod}\xrightarrow{\sim} \mathsf{NConn}(X;e)$$ where: 

A größencharakter $\chi$ has 2 equivalent formulations (I believe): either as a continuous character on the idele group $\chi: \mathbb{A}_K^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times$ with $K^\times$ in its kernel, or (modulo some ideal $\mathfrak{m}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$) as a character defined on the group $J^\mathfrak{m}$ of ideals coprime to $\mathfrak{m}$ such that there exist characters $$\chi_f: (\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{m})^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times, \quad \chi_\infty:\mathbf{R}^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times$$ which determine $\chi$ on principal integral ideals: $\chi((a)) = \chi_f(a)\chi_\infty(a)$ when $a\in\mathcal{O}_K$ is coprime to $\mathfrak{m}$. Here, $\mathbf{R}$ is the $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $$\mathbf{R} = \left\{(z,\overline{z}): z\in\mathbb{C}\right\}$$ and $K\hookrightarrow\mathbf{R}$ via $a\mapsto (a, \overline{a})$. (This definition of a größencharakter can be found, for example, in Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory, p.470.) Ideally I would like to see how either of these could be written down explicitly for this "größencharakter" $\psi_N$, and to understand how to extend this ad-hoc definition to a größencharakter in either sense. 

This is an answer, but my insight is hardly a mathematical one. Nonetheless, here we go: The 1955 paper of Turán is, in fact, published in both English and Chinese in the same journal. The Chinese version is pages 411-417 in the journal; the English language version is pages 417 - 423. Turán writes: "I am pretty sure that on the way one can evaluate $M_n(6)$ or $S_n(6)$ after a little longer calculations and also further." But he doesn't give a formula. 

Propp redoes, clarifies and generalizes domino shuffling in the following lovely paper: Propp, James. "Generalized domino-shuffling." Theoretical Computer Science 303, no. 2 (2003): 267-301. $URL$ The redone explanation is a way of thinking of the domino shuffle map locally, using a graph transformation called urban renewal; these days people also call it the spider move. The move replaces a 4-cycle in a graph (the "square", we might call it) with an 8-vertex graph made of a 4-cycle with a pendant edge on each vertex (the "spider"); the feet of the spider get attached where the vertices of the square were. Spider moves, when combined with a suitable reweighting of the edges in the graph, preserve the generating function for perfect matchings up to an explicit constant. The argument is much like the one in Elkies-Kuperberg-Larsen-Propp which you're asking about, but it is substantially streamlined because you only have to think about the square and the spider. In answer to your question: once you understand this point of view, odd-deficiency is obvious. When you reconstruct the domino shuffle using spider moves (which Propp explains how to do in the same paper), the squares and the spiders comprise the odd blocks, and all the action happens within them. The even blocks do not enter into the picture at all. As further evidence that the spider move is the correct point of view, Kenyon-Goncharov $URL$ recently used the spider move to define a certain cluster integrable system for the dimer model. 

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A smooth distribution $D$ on $M$ is the union of a family $\{D_p \leq T_p M : p\in M\}$ of vector spaces such that there is a family $\mathcal C $ of smooth vector fields on $M$ satisfying $D_p = \text{span}\{X_p : X\in \mathcal C \} $ for every $p \in M$. Remark that we do not ask the dimension of the fiber $D_p $ to be constant: we call a distribution regular if the dimension is constant, and singular if it is not. We call a distribution $D$ integrable if for every point $p \in M$ there is a submanifold $S\subseteq M$ which is tangent to $D$ and satisfies $T_q S = D_q $ for every $q \in S$. In this case, it can be proved that the maximal connected integral manifolds of the distribution form a partition of $M$ into weakly embedded submanifolds of $M$, which we call the foliation associated to $D$. Typical examples of integrable distributions are given by Lie algebroids: if $A\to M$ is a Lie algebroid over $M$ with anchor map $\rho : A\to TM$, then the image of $\rho $ is an integrable distribution on $M$. For example, every Poisson manifold has an integrable, possibly singular distribution given by the image of the Poisson bivector field $\Pi : T^*M\to TM $, and the induced foliation is precisely the symplectic foliation of the Poisson manifold. The integrability problem for regular distributions is solved by the Frobenious theorem: a regular distribution $D$ is integrable if and only if it's involutive. A singular version of the Frobenious theorem can be stated in the following way: a (possibly singular) distribution $D$ is integrable if and only if there is a family of vector fields $\mathcal C$ which span $D$ pointwise, such that the flow of every element of $\mathcal C$ preserves $D$ (see Theorem 3.5.10 of this book for a more precise statement and a proof). A sufficient condition for the integrability of a singular distribution $D$ is the following: there exists a module $\mathcal C$ of compactly supported vector fields spanning $D$ which is locally finitely generated and involutive. Some people calls such an object a Stefan-Sussman foliation. I have two related questions: 1) Is it true that every integrable distribution is spanned by a module $\mathcal C$ of compactly supported vector fields which is locally finitely generated and involutive? 2) Is it true that every integrable distribution is the image of the anchor map of some Lie algebroid? Clearly, (2) implies (1). There is people which believe that (2) is true, and I would like to know if this question is still open. Thank you! 

Pick a spanning tree of the ski trail map, e.g. by depth-first search or something. You can traverse it by always turning left at a junction. As you're doing this, walk out and back along each edge that's not in the tree. This uses each edge exactly twice. 

None of the other obvious statistics that describe this map are in the OEIS yet. Here are naive python implementations of $B_L, B_R, B_L^{-1}, B_R^{-1}$ if you want to check these assertions. 

I doubt there's a completely standard definition. It seems like this is elementary -- an undirected edge is a size-$k$ subset of $[1,n]$, and a directed edge is an undirected edge together with one of the possible $2^k$ labellings of it with "T" and "H". So the number of different edges is (if, say, empty head- and tail-sets are allowed) $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^k = 3^n$ Presumably a directed hypergraph consists of any collection of such edges, so there are $2^{3^n}$ of them. If this isn't the precise question you were wondering about, I'd wager that the one you're interested in is just as easy to count. 

You probably know the following already. Oh, well. Anyway, Eric Nordenstam and I answered exactly this problem. It is a special case of Theorem 1 in our preprint, $URL$ and it also appears in the proceedings of FPSAC 2012. Our method was inspired (and suggested) by Krattenthaler: We guessed the answer from empirical data, and then proved our guess was right by multiplying the matrices out and confirming that the answer was the identity matrix. 

Nice question! I believe the following provides a proof that hom-incomparability is a sufficient condition for the product to be a core. Let $G$ and $H$ be hom-incomparable cores and let $f$ be an endomorphism of the product $G\times H$. Then $f$ cannot "mix" the two factors. Formally, $f$ cannot be of the form $f=(\varphi,\psi)$ where $\varphi: G\rightarrow G$ and $\psi:G\rightarrow H$ (or any of the other obvious ways to mix the morphisms up) since $G$ and $H$ are hom-incomparable. Thus $f$ must preserve adjacency "pointwise" in the sense that $f=(f_G, f_H)$ where $f_G :G\rightarrow G$ and $f_H :H\rightarrow H$ are morphisms of the factor cores. Since $G$ and $H$ are cores, both of these morphisms are automorphisms. Hence $f$ is an automorphism of $G\times H$ with inverse $f^{-1} = (f_G^{-1}, f_H^{-1})$, so $G\times H$ is a core. 

By definition the de Rham fundamental group $\pi_1^{dR} (E^\times;b)$ is the Tannakian fundamental group of the category $\mathsf{Un}(X;e)$, with fiber functor $\omega$ sending a bundle to the stalk over a basepoint $b$ of $X$ (or for $e$, a suitable notion of "tangential basepoint"). By the above equivalence, it follows that there is an isomorphism between $\pi_1^{dR} (E^\times;e)$ and the Tannakian fundamental group of $R-\mathsf{NMod}$ (with the forgetful functor as fiber functor). In Corollary 2.2.7, Levin and Racinet claim that this Tannakian fundamental group is $$\pi_1^{dR} (E^\times; e)\cong \exp \mathbb{L}(\mathbf{t}, A).$$ I don't understand how this is calculated as the Tannakian fundamental group of $R-\mathsf{NMod}$. Would anyone be able to help me or point to how this is calculated? Many thanks! 

I apologize if this question is silly or confusing, I am completely new to this subject. Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. Denote by $\nabla$ the Levi-Civita connection of $(M,g)$. Now, let $S^{n}$ be an oriented compact manifold. Given an immersion $\phi:S\to M$ , denote by $\phi^{*}\nabla$ the Levi-Civita connection of $\left(S,\phi^{*}g\right) $ , by $ h^{\phi}$ the second fundamental form of $\phi$, and by $H^{\phi}$ the mean curvature vector field. Denote by $\nu_{\phi}$ the only Riemannian volume form on $\left(S,\phi^{*}g\right)$ which induces the given orientation on $S$ . The total tension of the immersion $\phi$ is the integral $\int_{S}\left|\left|H^{\phi}\right|\right|^{2}\nu_{\phi}$. Now, denote by $Imm\left(S,M\right)$ the space of smooth immersions of $S$ into $M$ . Then we can define the total tension functional $E:Imm\left(S,M\right)\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $E\left(\phi\right)=\int_{S}\left|\left|H^{\phi}\right|\right|^{2}\nu_{\phi}$ . Denote $I=Imm(S,M)$. Then $I$ is a smooth infinite dimensional Frechet space, and its tangent space $T_\phi I$ is the space of smooth vector fields $X:S\to TM$ along $\phi$. We can define in a natural way a Riemannian metric $G$ on $I$ induced by $g$ and the orientation of $N$. It is defined pointwise as $G_\phi (X,Y)=\int_S g(X,Y)\nu_\phi $. This allows us to consider the flow of the vector field $-grad E$. I am sure this flow has been studied extensively. Can you point me some reference to articles about it? Thank you.
