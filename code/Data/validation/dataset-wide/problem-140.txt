The plan is to turn the star into a big positive electric charge dump and the planet a negative one. Why not the opposite? Solar winds! Stars eject part of their mass at space all the time, so you don't want to trow anything light at them. So, you build a satellite that launches a stream of very heavy ionized nucleus at the star. That same solar wind will try to get some undesirable electron into your stream and foil your world moving plans. To avoid that we will probably need a chain of satellites with which to shield the stream by clever use of magnetic fields (made easier because you know from which direction the particle wind comes). Still the same annoying solar wind will cause us more trouble. By moving particles from the star to the planet we can get a dreaded electric current between them even if the whole stream is perfectly protected. The solution? Making our ion stream massive. The stream should move more change than the solar wind can counter. The increase in total change inside the star might influence the amount of wind expelled, but it will go in all directions and the extra amount that arrives on the planet should be small. In short: place an array of satellites between planet and star guiding and protecting a massive stream of super-heavy futuristic nucleus into the star. 

Electrostatics! Since you are not in a hurry, you can increase, or decrease the attractive force of the star on the planet. Changing gravity is though, but creating ions that generate a very similar force is easy. I will now assume you want to get your planet closer to the star, it is easy to do the opposite and have the opposite effect. 

Targeting You didn't say how much of the planet the Eel-Men were using, so I'll assume that they have densely populated cities and large uninhabited areas. There are lots of economics reasons why this would be expected. So, the first order of business is to figure out what needs to be destroyed, and what can/should be preserved. I presume the Eel-Men do not have enough resources to effectively patrol every cubic km of their ocean, and that defenses are concentrated around valuable targets. The interesting question is whether the Eel-Men leadership would put anti-orbital weapons on land to deny the use of land to the Lizard-Men, or if they would cede the land to concentrate on their precious underwater holdings. Invasion Land-based defenses would be susceptible to orbital bombardment, so I assume that the Eel-Men would not bother. In this case, the Lizard-Men should try to establish a beach-head literally on the beach, but approached from space, rather than the water, because in this world, the sea is more dangerous than the air. Of course, this already presents a huge problem for the Eel-Men, because logistics is now much, much easier for the Lizard Marines. Instead of dropping a huge infantry force and suffering massive casualties, they can just drop AA batteries over the centers of continents, which should be the least defended, and transport them to the edges of the continents, where they can interdict any missiles launched from underwater. This should make it much more effective to drop troops and supplies. In this manner, they can achieve air/space superiority over continents with a fairly low casualty rate. Denial The Lizard-Men can now use their orbital/air superiority to eliminate Eel-Man observation stations above water. Now the Eel-Men don't even know where the Lizard-Men are massing to attack and lack early warning until they approach the water. Of course, the Lizard-Men would use props and disinformation tactics to make it look like they were gathering near one juicy target while actually massing towards another one. This would force the Eel-Men to spread their forces thin to defend all vulnerable cities, or to commit a strong defense to the most likely target(s). The Lizard-Men get to shape the battle space to their advantage. The one benefit the Eel-Men do have is that they can lightly defend the cities furthest towards the center of the ocean, and gather forces mostly around the continents (you didn't mention whether the Eel-Men liked all depths, or preferred to live on the continental shelves). Attack Finally, the Lizard-Men attack one or more high value targets (ideally the ones which would most demoralize the defending army to force an early surrender). They would use a diversionary force to draw Eel-Men to the wrong location, and then strike the actual targets if the Eel-Men take the bait. The real risk here is that once the Lizard-Men go underwater, they are at an immediate disadvantage. Their entire war machine is likely optimized for land warfare, since that is how they evolved. They would need to spend years training underwater before launching the invasion strike so that they will be prepared. Even so, the further underwater they go, the more risk they assume. Operating at 30m depth would be difficult and risky, but usually survivable. If the Eel-Men can dive to, say, 1000m, and that is where their cities are, then the Lizard-Men must always operate in submarines once they attack, and the Eel-Men only need to compromise their hulls to defeat them. Tactics Obviously, torpedoes will be the most effective stand-off weapon, and the Lizard-Men would be well-advised to employ them liberally. Fielding big ships themselves would be needlessly expensive for the Eel-Men, as their best tactic would be swarming. Torpedoes are effective against large, slow-moving ships, but pretty useless against a swarm of 100 nearly-naked Eel-Men swimming at high speed and armed with attachable mines. A torpedo requires a fairly large boat to carry it, so Lizard-Men will need decent-size submarines to bring the heavy firepower to the Eel-Man cities. Essentially, torpedoes are the only effective artillery the Lizard-Men can bring to bear on their underwater enemies, so large submarines are unavoidable. The threat of swarming swimmers means that they will also need point defense, which could be harpoon guns on turrets. However, this will become very expensive very quickly. Even if the harpoons are very small, the subs will not be able to carry an indefinite supply of them, and the Eel-Men can approach from literally every direction. Trying to defend an entire sphere of space at range is extremely difficult. If the effective range of the harpoons/fletchettes is only a dozen meters or so, then they will need many turrets all over the sub just to deal with swarmers. Of course, they can also eject depth charges to deal with un-armored swimmers, but again, there are only so many they can carry. The Eel-Men can also bring ships to the fight, and they can quite effectively force the Lizard-men to fire their counter-measures with mass torpedoes. In fact, they don't even need to all be live. They can use mostly fake torpedoes to force defensive action, because the Lizard-Men will not be able to tell which are real and which are duds. Thus, the Eel-Men can clear the way for the swimmers, which then just swim up to the subs and plant charges, and swim away. They will take casualties, for sure, but they can make the fight very expensive for the Lizard-Men, who have to build the subs from scratch on land, while the Eel-Men have been building war machines for decades. In fact, the Eel-Men may simply have leviathan ships which are massive torpedo boats which can overwhelm an entire squadron of Lizard subs' countermeasures. Surely the Eel-Men will have fought each other over sea floor and natural resources, so they should have this technology already. The ocean is a very inhospitable terrain for the Lizard-Men. Although depth charges are quite damaging to unprotected swimmers, they are just as damaging if not more so to a sub operating near its maximum depth. If the Lizard-Men are required to dive 1000, 2000, 3000m to take key Eel-Man cities, then surely their subs will be vulnerable to even the slightest local overpressure caused by a detonating torpedo. This is like the effect where you can stand on an empty aluminum can, but if you just tap the side very lightly, it instantly collapses. Eel-Man torpedo barrages don't even need to hit the Lizard-Man subs. They just need to create enough shock wave near the subs to compromise their hull integrity. The weight of a 2000m water column will squish the subs like tin cans. This means that Lizard-Men will have to interdict all torpedoes at stand-off range, which seems nearly impossible. The lethal effective radius for an Eel-Man torpedo might be 100m or more, just because of overpressure deformation. Trying to keep all torpedoes outside a 100m sphere of a Lizard-Man sub might just be impossible at their level of technology. Conclusion I think the only ways the Lizard-Men can triumph are: 

How "Universal body history" changed the design of escape pods forever. Actually, nowadays escape pods don't even have fuel, sail or any sort of propulsion after the ejection stage. Any device holding passenger with a propulsion system is cataloged as spaceship, not as escape pod. The cost of delta-v Old pod designs used to have propulsion, but it's been abandoned due to astronomical cost. They could not perform atmospheric re-entry without crashing or maintain life long enough or once down the gravity well, so the best best would just be to group together and stay in space. As seen in other answer, space is huge so don't waste collective efforts rescuing Joe Noobpilot. Old designs used to let fully automated pods group themselves. Due to space flight mechanics and the cost of delta-v, pods ejecting from the ship hull in all directions using rockets would not be able to fly into parallel routes, let alone group together. One solution: the pods would have to slowly drift from the main ship, not good to escape an impending explosion. Or be ejected using rockets from a limited number of flat areas on the main ship hull. Flat, so that they flee from the ship with parallel trajectories to stay somewhat grouped, limiting the cost of chasing them. All those reasons have led to ban of manual override of fuel systems. But that's no longer much of a trouble, because everything changed with universal body history. How universal body history solved the delta-v problem. Matter is costly. Rescue bodies, sure, but don't rescue matter. Space is huge so the chances of being rescued are indeed zero. Sure, radio beacons, etc, but simply it's too expensive to send matter there to gather more matter. Let's just broadcast via radio a diff of the body structure. Whenever you visit a place where your civilization is represented (spaceports on planets, orbital stations, major ships), your body is already scanned down to the atomic level for identification and health check-up, something Federation and all human rights accepted since the Great Epidemic. The information is kept in a compressed history of scans similar to Git, one copy in your civilization's records (synced between sites), a few copies kept on you (it sometimes has allowed to locally rebuild a full body from parts like in The Fifth Element). Rescue information, efficiently What the escape pod does is to cryogenize your body, scan it again, add that to local history with a git commit, which make a very concise diff than is sent via radio signals. Repeatedly. Until it runs out of energy. Using Fountain codes for resilient one-way transmission. Then the atoms in the pod just statistically lie there in the huge eternal void of space. Not rescuing matter is what the Federation wanted. Fuse matter to send energy Interestingly, limited data (thanks to history compression) and supercold fusion of the atoms making up your body and the pod make enough energy to broadcast the signal to the whole solar system. In virtually every case, several sites can catch the signal reliably. Most of the mass of the pod is the supercold fusion device. The final state of body in pod is a shiny wad of iron atoms. Build back the body from other atoms Receivers will pick the signal and attach it to your git history. Rebuilding the body is just the second half of plain old teleportation which Federation and the progressive wing of human rights activists already agreed upon. Your civilization rules will figure out where and when to rebuild your body (due to Duplication Ban Act). You'll wake up in that place, with memories about what happened (though, telemetry data will often be more useful that your memories to know what happened). Human right benefit of the fuel-less pod. The atoms that made up your body aren't actually important. You swap them with strangers any time you take a teleporting device anyway. It's a quicker and cheaper way to journey through Sol anyway. The actual benefit of a rescue pod is to keep your body intact long enough for a scan and provide the latest and freshest state to resurrect you, instead of the state of your last visit to a major site. That's why human right activists accepted the scheme, even for individuals that object the use of teleporters (you know, that regressive wing of the human right activists). It's also why there aren't always as many escape pods as there are passengers. Some passengers prefer to revert to the state before the flight, anyway, so the escape pod is of no use to them. Ah, those people regressive and rich enough to still use physical travel... they finance the regressive part of society, but the fair disputation procedure managed quite a good compromise! 

Others have given the best answers to why any humans would pay for or go on this mission, but an important consideration is whether it even succeeds. After all, your world may have the technology to spot potential farway homes, but that is not the same as colonizing them. Some worlds may be duds. Some colony ships may like space so much, the idea of landing is actually unappealing. Some might decide to camp out in the middle of nowhere, setting up a rest stop on the interstellar highway in anticipation of all the future traffic. After all, if you have a ship big enough to sustain generations of humans, you have a complete moving world all by itself. The first generation will grow weary of the confinement, but the second generation will never know the freedom of a full planet. By the third or fourth generation, the idea of living on planets may become a full-on heresy, on all the colony ships. This idea was lightly explored in Larry Niven's Footfall. 

Technically, firmware is "hardware", so I would expect it to remain. I assume that "disappearing binaries" is more about the information being removed than a physical calamity which struck all information storage devices but narrowly missed anything which didn't look like running machine code. If indeed firmware remained, then I think we would have a good head start. We should be able to boot any system which can run off firmware, and at least have some primitive OS and text editing capability. The interesting problem is that if we have source code, but most of it is electronic, then it is mostly useless to us until we can restore the systems that are able to read it. Since there is so much potentially usable software lying around, it would make the most sense to reproduce the compilers which could rebuild the software. This means society would most likely not try to reinvent programming languages from scratch until we had recovered the ones we just lost. Since we have lost the use of the internet and digital information storage, our best bet is to target the best-documented languages for which we have books. Without a doubt, a C compiler will be the first and most important high-level tool in the rebuilding. Once you have that, progress can be made very quickly. You can then rebuild entire OSes, many software tools, and compilers for a lot of languages. There is a reason that this 40 year old language still tops the TIOBE list. It is the "English" of the programming world: awkward, annoying, ubiquitous and powerful. Since there are so many C/C++ experts in the world, once you have a system which can enter text and store bytes on disk, building a compiler should actually not be that hard. Most likely, a bunch of folks would be improving the "IDE" through raw assembly/machine code, and probably re-inventing it from scratch just to improve productivity. Many parts of a minimal OS would be brute-forced just to get this first C compiler up and running. But I'm pretty sure that getting the first self-hosting build of the compiler would be the moral equivalent of the starter on a giant engine finally firing up the flywheel so it can be self-sustaining. In fact, this process would most likely happen in many places all over the world. It's entirely possible that Russia or Eastern Europe produces the first working C compiler "post-catastrophe" due to the number of hackers/virus writers who have to understand low-level code. Although China has a lot of hackers, they tend to take higher-level pathways into systems. I would be surprised if they created an early C compiler from scratch (although, a big group of enterprising university students may accomplish this through sheer force of will). The US and Western European hackers would have the advantage of the most C books and reference manuals available to them, and in a language they easily understand. Now, if firmware is also zapped, things get much, much harder, along the lines of switch toggling as described by others. That is so depressing I can't even contemplate it. But I assume that the threads merge once you get to a basic console (keyboard, monitor, persistent store...whether disk, tape, flash, etc.). Although many languages have self-hosting compilers, most of the compilers could be rebuilt from scratch in C, and most of the original language designers could aid in this effort. I think overall, the rebuild would proceed much faster than people might imagine (from basic console to self-hosting C compiler in 6 months or less). In almost all cases, folks would probably decide that it's better to simply replace what was lost and regain the functionality than to run off the rails and redesign things. A redesign would occur if you also lost the source code. Perhaps information is retained in books, but if all electronic executables and source were lost, then I think we would see a significant redesign and shortcut to more advanced techniques. I think C would still be rebuilt from scratch, because of its status as a kind of lingua franca. And possibly Java and a few other major languages would be revived (though obviously from clean-room implementations). On the other hand, it would be much harder to restore Linux or Windows or OS X without any source code, from just books. Interestingly, we could take this opportunity to eliminate a lot of nagging flaws from the languages, tools, and operating systems. Perhaps we wouldn't get C exactly, but a kind of enhanced C99 with a lot of legacy cruft removed. On the one hand, it would be to everyone's benefit to simply implement an exact C99 compiler, so that people from around the world could exchange C sources as the digital world was being rebuilt. This would discourage innovation. And for this reason, Linux would most likely become the de facto OS of the new era, simply because many portions of it could be restored from books and knowledge locked away in certain high-level wizards. Probably proprietary software would simply fail to compete until the majority of functionality would be replaced. So the rebuild would most likely occur under a very open model, unless some countries noticed that they were progressing much faster than others, and could gain competitive advantage by closing off their progress from the rest of the world. At the end of the day, global commerce would force countries to re-establish international standards, so it is hard to say how long such walls could survive. Although many failed languages would simply not be reproduced (unless by their loving creators), the most popular languages would surely be revived because of the stored value of programmers with proficiency in those languages. The same is true of tools. However, it would take a long time to rebuild something like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop, let alone Windows Server 2012. These tools may never exist again, and perhaps there would be a new arms race to reinvent each software category from scratch. Every technology with a published standard would out-compete proprietary alternatives with no public standard, simply because the standards would represent intellectual effort preserved in text that does not need to be redone. But the weakest standard technologies may be displaced by better alternatives simply because the weight of legacy has been lifted and is no longer such a great advantage to bad old solutions.
