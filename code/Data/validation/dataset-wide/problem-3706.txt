All recovery is shared All training takes a toll from all other training. This can be minimized by working separate parts of the body or separate metabolic pathways, but in the end your ability to recover from any workout is shared across all workouts, all you eat, all your stress, all your sleep. Running and arms work sounds fine That said, if you're used to running three times a week and you add in some push-ups and pull-ups, then you shouldn't experience a significant decrease in your recovery from either. Make sure that you have at least one day a week of complete rest--no running, no arm work, just taking it easy with a stroll or massage or nothing at all. If you were doing an extensive bodybuilding routine (with many exercises, heavy weights, and many sets to failure), it might be a problem. If you're new to both modes of exercise, recovery would be affected, but you'd do fine. I'd be more concerned with getting an adequate balance of upper-body movements: be sure to mix pushes and pulls, strength work with endurance work, and so on. 

I've done this, and I found that it may have helped improve my overhead press by five or ten pounds over the course of a month. It also stressed my shoulder joint (through both overuse and under-warmup) to the point where I had to take time off training. 

To my knowledge, this is fairly well-known in exercise science: an aerobic base is fairly general, but beyond that, cardio is largely activity-specific (especially compared to strength). 

Lifting heavy isn't enough The idea that lifting heavy weights by itself causes bulk is a myth. Understanding why is more complicated. First, let's address the specific claim at issue, that women need to stick to 5-pound weights. Kathleen Ekdahl points out that five pounds is too light to even count as weights! 

Without running games, carrying and climbing things, random play, contests and sport, people wither. They atrophy in a number of ways too great to detail here. They roll the dice with cancer and heart disease. Their body becomes used to inactivity in its metabolism and its mind, making changes later in life to diet and exercise habits harder. I could cite studies that talk about the occlusion of arteries and the long-term effects of sitting, but I think we're all clear that there are real health consequences to being inactive for ten years. Perhaps one can mitigate those negative effects by turning their habits around, but it's like smoking: you do immediate good by quitting, but reversing the damage takes a long time. Sometimes it takes longer than you have left. 

(From page 222. Page 176 also describes strength losses with reference to the same studies.) This is why when you came back to exercise you experienced the results you did: much of your strength remained, but your endurance (such as fo machine exercises) almost disappeared. 

There are diagrams comparing efficiency with a small chest versus a big chest for bench, and a small thigh versus a big thigh for the squat. One has more leverage with a bigger muscle. Proof Consider: the lighter weight classes consistently lift less than the heavier weight classes. If you are training for strength and power with no regard for anything else, you'll want to gain tremendous amounts of size. It's possible to get very, very, very strong and powerful without gaining much size, or even any size, or doing any hypertrophy-specific work. But being bigger allows you to lift more. 

To Sum Up The chalked double overhand hook grip is the Goldilocks of deadlift grips: the best mix of safety and strength training for both grip and the rest of the body. 

Deadlifts and squats. (Pullups wouldn't hurt.) Getting beastly strong in your back and shoulders will A) make keeping proper posture easier, since it'll take a smaller amount of effort from bigger, stronger muscles and B) give you awesome practice, since deadlifts and squats require a strongly locked-in shoulders-back position. Conscious decision to always keep good posture. Imagine a thread connected to the crown of your head pulling you as tall as can be. Stand-up desk to practice at work. 

Handstand work I don't see a particular reason to wait before starting handstand work. Get upside down now, and work on your handstand progression in parallel with your one-arm pushup goal. My handstand work involves handstand holds, "running" (alternating hands), and handstand pushups as deep as I can go (which is not far). I do barbell overhead presses for raw pressing strength across the full range of motion. At the moment all my handstand work is using a wall, but getting good at freestanding work is another progression to think about. I bet that doing handstand holds and short-range-of-motion handstand pushups will help you work up to a full handstand pushup better than regular pushups. Gymless workouts in general I recommend searching around for bodyweight-only strength programs to inform your training choices. I hear good things about Convict Conditioning as well as Ross Enamait's work. 

As for core strength, barbell and gymnastic exercises are far superior. Holding a plank is one thing to ask of your spinal erectors and abs, but squatting or deadlifting a barbell heavier than you are is quite another. Though the evidence is clear that stretching before or after exercise does not reduce muscle soreness or injury incidence, I have found anecdotally (and without objective measurement) that a little yoga in the morning reduces muscle soreness from heavy workouts done a night or two before. 

Definitions Powerlifting would be better called strengthlifting. It is training for strength using a barbell. It is a sport consisting of the squat, bench press, and deadlift, though powerlifting training often includes other similar exercises such as the overhead press as well as supplementary exercises such as power variants of the Olympic lifts, isolation work, bands, chains, and even track work and yoga. Bodybuilding is a beauty contest for men. It involves a wide variety of exercises, primarily barbells, dumbbells, and machines used for hypertrophy, as well as conditioning and strict diet protocols used for cutting weight. There is significant overlap between the training regimes of the two, since size and strength, though different attributes, are not orthogonal. For instance, a powerlifter may use a "bodybuilding" routine during the off-season in order to build muscle size and give her body a rest from the low-rep, high-intensity work of one-rep-max powerlifting. Similarly, bodybuilders frequently use powerlifting exercises such as heavy, low-rep deadlifts, bench press, and back squats in order to promote whole-body growth and increase their strength so that they can lift greater volume with lighter weights. Choosing When picking an approach, compare your goal to the goal of each practice. Do you want strength or to look good? It's not an entirely either-or proposition, but if health and athletics is more of a priority than looking big, it would be best to start with a powerlifting template and, if necessary, replace some parts of the program with specific elements bodybuilding exercises. Bodybuilding has become synonymous with lifting weights in much of the world. People think of curls and the bench press when they imagine a weight room, and Arnold Schwarzennegger when they think of a lifter. This is not necessarily helpful for directing the general population to a program that fits their goals. Bodybuilding is a fine practice, but its wide array of isolation exercises performed with an emphasis on hypertrophy is not optimal for health or fitness for most people. When picking tools, it's better to evaluate the specific exercise rather than the community or practice it comes from. Outside of bodybuilding, it's hard to justify a machine squat over a barbell squat. Outside of powerlifting, it's hard to find a reason to train strength without regard for other attributes. It's best to take what each sport does best: powerlifting's strength training, bodybuilding's conditioning and diet regimen for losing fat while retaining muscle. 

Sometimes a very light workout is useful during a recovery day, but one's capacity for active rest intensity varies person-to-person, again according to Greg Everett: 

How Much Bad Form Is OK? There are perfect reps and there are good reps. There are iffy reps and there are bad reps. Good form leaves a buffer zone, where you're so on-point, everything braced and in precisely the position it should be with strength and mobility and speed to spare. That way, when you need to challenge yourself with more weight or more reps or even just a bad workout day, you can afford to not check every box of your best effort. In other words, there's a difference between "that rep was not perfect" and "that rep was dangerous". 

Swimming, like literally any activity, can be a form of resistance training. However, generally in sports training the purpose of resistance training is to provide a more general stimulus than sport-specific training. That is, it's unlikely that you'll get much stronger by doing the same kind of swimming you've been doing for some time. You can absolutely gain more skill at the stroke, better conditioning for the activity, and so on, but as strength and power stimulus the sport-specific movement very quickly fades into inefficacy. So yes, swimming can be resistance training, but if you're already pretty good at it then it won't provide the benefits of non-sport-specific resistance training. 

One and a half to start. Double after some time. More than double requires dedication to strength training that may be unnecessary for other purposes like martial arts and health. 

If you're consistently aching, consider the idea that you might be overtraining. The eating part is a separate question. 

The Universe is an Uncaring Void I've seen sources say "3x5" (three sets of five) but denote their workouts as 100x5x3 (100 pounds, 5 reps, 3 sets). I've also seen sources say "3x5" and write 3x5 and mean three sets of five in both cases. There is no clear answer to your question. YxZ is fundamentally ambiguous. Show Your Units In physics, I was taught to never leave the units ambiguous in our calculations. "5" means nothing; "5 Newtons" means something. I think that advice applies here too. We have competing standards each trying to be the One True Answer. Our only reasonable course of action is to somehow indicate that 3x5 in this case means three sets of five rather than five sets of three. I independently developed two methods of showing my units: marking my sets as I complete them, and putting commas between "x reps" to show different sets. The Ticking-Off-Sets Method I do this haphazardly in my own training notes, either simply remembering, or ticking off sets as I complete them: 

Disclaimer: I am not a physical therapist or personal trainer, which may be what your friend needs. I'd start with bodyweight squats, holding onto the two ends of a doorknob, or post-like object in front of them, as low as possible. Do those frequently, increasing depth as much and as frequently as possible. Over time, rely on the post less and less: hold it lighter, or with only two fingers, then one finger, then keeping your hands next to it just in case, then giving up the post. Keep increasing the depth until the butt touches the calves or heels. Working on the best squat one can do, consistently and frequently, should be safe and productive. This is the method described in T-Nation's Third World Squat article, which goes into more detail:
