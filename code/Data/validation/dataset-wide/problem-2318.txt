It's currently April and I know that's considered late in the season for hunting coyote. Given that I live in a desert climate, how late can you hunt coyote? Is there a reason why I couldn't hunt them into the summer and other parts of the year? I have already checked with my local/state laws and there are no time limitations on coyotes. 

I like to hunt on foot, walking through the desert. I mostly shoot jackrabbits since those are plentiful in my area. However, I still haven't found a good system for carrying the animals back to the car once I am done. I might walk up to 3 miles (5 km) and shoot jackrabbits along the way and I'm almost always carrying a backpack with me along with my rifle. Most of the field kit "game bags" I have come across are designed for large game like elk or deer and are much too big for my use. What is the best approach to carrying 2-3 rabbits back with me? Is there some method I can use that also straps to the back of my backpack? 

I'm a lurker on two knife-related forums (Bladeforums.com and Knifeforums.com). On both of them, "what knife should I buy" or "what is the best knife for X" are either closed quickly or become very hot topics because there is no right answer, only lots and lots and lots of opinions. See this thread for a recent discussion of the topic (including some nice pictures). That said, there are some general guidelines. First of all, make sure it is legal! Carrying an illegal knife on the Appalachian Trail will get you in the same trouble as carrying an illegal knife on the streets of New York. A LEO might cut you some slack in the wilderness, but they don't have to. Fixed blade vs folding blade. Fixed blades are tougher, which is great if you are going to be splitting firewood or cutting branches or digging holes. Size Bigger blades (both length and thickness) are better at chopping wood but are far worse at small tasks like skinning small game and slicing food and cutting rope. Serrations Serrated blades are better at cutting fibrous materials like rope but suck at cutting soft food like cheese and tomatoes. Typical bushcraft tasks are usually better with a straight edge (though a serrated edge makes pretty good feather sticks for firelighting). Metal Harder steels hold an edge longer but are harder to sharpen in the field. Softer steels might roll over the edge when chopping. Some types of steel are better than others at making sparks from your fire rod. There is no such thing as rustproof. Stainless steel is just steel that takes a bit longer to rust. :-) All knives need good care. Unless you are spending a lot of money on a titanium blade. Shape Straight edge blades (like the "american tanto" design) suck at cutting food. The curve, or "belly", of the edge is what helps cutting through the entire draw of the knife. Saws on the back of the blade mean you can't use the blade for batonning very well and you will hurt your hand in some knife grips. A lot of military knives with saw backs are for ripping through aircraft skin. Leave the sawblades to Rambo. What do I carry? I carry a Victorinox Outrider Swiss Army lockable folding knife. The long blade is for food prep (it is long enough to cut through an apple in one go). The sawblade on it is long enough to deal with firewood and track maintenance. The scissors probably get used more than anything else on the blade. I've used the can opener a few times and the corkscrew only once (wine bottles and tins don't go hiking often as they are heavy). If I am going somewhere camping I also carry a CRKT Stiff KISS MDP. It is small, light, strong enough for me to whack it through wood with a baton and cheap enouygh that if I break it I don't care. It is a bushcraft knife and does not go near food. The Victorinox is legal carry in New Zealand. The CRKT is not, so I have to make sure it stays in my backpack when driving to and from the trip. Final Thoughts You are not Rambo. Don't carry a massive piece of movie-madness cutlery (termed "tacticLOL" on the forums above). If you are Rambo, then disregard all of this. You can do whatever the heck you want - I'm certainly not going to argue. Edit: Thanks Ben. 

What you are describing is also known as "primitive camping" and searching for that in your state might lead to better results. Camping is allowed on all land that is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in your state. If you look up your local MD BLM office, their web page might contain a list of primitive camping areas. I know that for my state of Nevada, they highlight 5 places as primitive campsites as well as the rules for picking your own campsite on any BLM land. 

I might be in the market for a new Benelli R1. But I can't seem to get a straight answer on where it is made. Obviously, I know that Benelli is a Beretta company and the Benelli address is listed in MD (not far from Accokeek). But is the Benelli R1 made in the US or is it made in Italy, or somewhere else? To be clear, I am specifically interested in the R1 - I know that manufacturers sometimes make different arms in different parts of the world. 

Let me turn the question around: Is it ethical to use a portable stove to burn irreplaceable fossil fuels? Is it ethical to carry that fossil fuel in a pressurised can (for gas fuel stoves) or metal bottle (for liquid fuel stoves) that can't be easily recycled and so ends up in landfill? However, note Shem's comment below - Aluminium bottles are almost infinitely recyclable. I think the answer lies in the scale. Using a few twigs in a twig burner is fine. Using all the dead trees in a half-kilometer radius to build a bonfire the size of your tent is not. Most of the outdoor places where I go in New Zealand are under fire bans and most of the huts have had their open fires replaced with potbelly stoves which aren't that good for cooking, so I have no choice but to carry a portable cooker. 

If the tent fly can be pitched without the inner then your winter tent becomes a summer tent by leaving the inner at home. 

The biggest landowner in the US, and that allows widespread camping, is the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. They have offices on a state and regional level. If you visit the web pages of the BLM in the state(s) that you are going to visit, then I'm sure that you will find information on maps and areas. You can camp in ANY land that is owned by the BLM and most of them have very few rules and don't often require permits or fees. 

I am trying to find some binoculars for hunting. I generally zero my rifle to fire at 100 yards. I really can't imagine shooting animals much further than this distance, although for scouting and getting a larger field of view, I might want to go out to 150 yards. What is an appropriate magnification for something like this? Largest field of view possible, for 100-150 yards 

NEVER, EVER fire a round in your pistol that it was not designed for! The only caliber that you should be using is the one that is written on the frame of the weapon. If your issues are rooted in how the gun makes you feel, then the answer is to consider buying a firearm with a different caliber. 

Given that it is above the mesh pocket at the side, my guess is that it is for walking/ski poles. If you need to put the poles away for a short time (for example, a traverse using your ice axe, a river crossing), you don't need to go to the trouble of loosening the compression straps (the ones holding the tent poles in the photos above). 

Scheduled Transport If you are catching scheduled transport (e.g. bus or ferry) then you need a watch. There might only be one trip a day. If you miss it, you are stuck for an extra night. You might be ticketed on one particular time, so if you are late, the next bus or plane won't pick you up. For example, the Milford Track Great Walk in New Zealand. There are only two boat trips a day in summer, and you are ticketed for one specific time. If you miss that, the other ferry that day will only take you if there is space available. Tides If your transport is a boat that can only get in at high tide, then you need a watch. If you are making a crossing that can only be done at low tide, then you need a watch. 

In a previous question, I had asked for help in finding a GPS app with certain features. That led me to find Gaia GPS and it has been great, no complaints. However, I had a situation recently. I found a hike through an online guidebook and it was listed as 3.1 miles. I went out and did a track on it (with Gaia) and it came up as being close to 5 miles. I wrote to the author of the guidebook, thinking that he might want an update. He checked through his notes and also asked for my tracks from Gaia and showed me how Gaia can be inaccurate and my actual track was a really squiggly line adding all kinds of crazy distance. He said he also used Gaia and would get the same weird results. I dont know what he used to create the actual distances in the guide. He stood by his statement of the hike being about 3.1 miles. But I'm still uncomfortable with this conclusion. The hike just "felt" longer than 3.1 miles. Also, there's the factor of time. I'm not a fast hiker at all but the loop took me 3.5 hours to do. For a 5 miler, that puts me at 45 minutes/mile - totally reasonable - but a 3 miler would be 1 hour+ per mile - no one is that slow! Time is the only "fixed" factor in this and that would indicate that its more than 3.1 miles. So is Gaia really that inaccurate? Or is there something else at work here? 

It is not. The lowest-impact solution is to use a poo-pot. These are compulsory in alpine areas here in New Zealand. Pack it out - Poo pots 

Ray Mears has produced videos on sharpening knives. In particular, sharpening them in camp and in the field. The teqhnique is pretty much as @WedaPashi explains it, but it's good to see a video of the correct approach. 

I have friends who swear by silk inners. They are thin, so can be worn under other gloves, but are extremely warm for the thickness. Combine these with windstopper outers - as mentioned elsewhere, layering is good practice. On the downside, silk is really expensive, at least where I live. On the upside, silk lasts a long time and doesn't get smelly. 

Growing up in rural New Zealand, we often encountered electric fences. Some of them were illegally high-powered to deal with big animals. We tested fences either with the back of our hands or with a piece of grass. As specified a few times in this question (thanks @Michael Martinez), using the back of the hand is for safety. An electric shock can cause muscles to clench. If you place your hand around the wire and get shocked then you risk being unable to unclench your hand. Using the back of the hand, with the palm away from any wires, means that if a shock clenches your muscles then your hand and arm move away from the wires. An anecdote: A mate of mine grew up on a farm used for Sweetwaters (a popular music festival a few decades ago). He says that the combination of stoned hippies and electric fences was extremely entertaining. In answer to another question above, I have a cousin who peed on an electric fence. It was not a pleasant experience (for him, anyway, his mates were laughing their heads off).
