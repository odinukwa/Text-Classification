From what I read, you are just requesting what you deserve: proper compensation for your contribution to the company. Congratulations for being extra-productive and passionate for your work, I would hire one like you. But under most regulation, if not all (as soon as slavery is still forbidden) you have the legal right to request what you deserve. Your boss is at a serious jeopardy from the legal point of view, because, ultimately, and as last resort, you may sue him. For office jobs, working overtime without any form of compensation (either a +15% bonus for each overtime hour or a forfait bonus at year end) may be a criminal offence. Requesting Allowing an employee (regulator assumes that if an employee is working extra, he's not doing that by his own initiative) to work overtime longer than a yearly quota of 250 hours is a criminal offence in my regulation. I wouldn't threaten your boss. I would sit with him and discuss about your importance in the company, your successes and your constant effort. Your boss would be definitely a moron if he refuses to negotiate a raise that is proportional to the extra time. A professional like you can find a job in no time, possibly without slavery. Some points for the conversation: 

Most likely what he meant was "shows lack of commitment in terms of joining a new company". I.e. if you won't talk salary, you aren't really looking for a new position. You obviously felt it was too early to talk salary, and wanted to get other details settled first. If my interpretation is correct, then the problem was a communication failure (unless you were just testing the waters, and he correctly identified that). While there are exceptions, in most cases it is reasonable to want the other party to be as interested in establishing a relationship (i.e employment) as you are. If you are determined that you don't want to disclose salary expectations too soon, you might give consideration to how you can express commitment to the process of finding new employment. 

If you are going to stay more in that company, never ever leave negative feedback. Full stop. This will only go against you. Even if you are not the single employee in that position, reducing the chances to two or three people is too risky. You might be recognized as the author even in the future. For example if for whatever reason you unwillingly show you know Glassdoor more than your coworkers. Legally Your boss may or may not do anything to you. In my country he may fire you without a valid reason if total employees are < 15. Otherwise the company is not enough "small", but there could always be ways for premature termination. Practically You might be subject to mobbing/stalking. That is a crime under several regulations but is extremely hard to prove. Examples of mobbing are under-assignements, or under-qualification of assignements. It is difficult to prove that such behaviour originates from an harassment. If you are going to leave your company, you can honestly write whatever you deem useful. Please, for respect of the others before the law, don't exagerate or say false. Defamation is a crime for a reason. Be objective, keep proof for yourself, use facts 

I doubt you could give acceptable reasons that are acceptable to the company. Those reasons would consist of qualifications or benefits to the company you did not bring to the table when you were interviewing. There is little that would fit that description. Maybe if you completed a job specific training in the meantime that you did not mention before, or maybe you got divorced and now you can do all the overtime you said you'd rather not do. But any reasons why you need more money for the same deal are null and void. They are of no interest to the company. If you verbally accepted all the details, then renegotiating them will come across as erratic, volatile and slightly illoyal. If however, the written contract contains details that you did not know when you accepted, then discussing them would be not as bad, especially if the are not standard and you did not expect them to be that way. My experience is that although employers do all those checks and screens and interviews, as long as you haven't actually worked there, you are a potential risk. Once you did work there and proved them you are going to earn them money, it's a lot easier to ask them to give you more money in form of a raise. Once you got in, you have a way better position negotiating, if only for the fact that if you fail to get a raise you still got your job to fall back to as a base to either do better in the next round of raises or find another job. 

The question I have seen is "may we contact this employer" (with or without mentioning the start date). I would say that is a fairly common question. I would also say that it is fairly common for the answer to be no for the current employer. Not always, but quite frequently. So, asking the question doesn't seem at all strange. What does seem strange is the flat refusal to hire someone if they said no. Normally the applicant is CONSIDERING leaving their current position, and there are any number of reasons why they wouldn't want the current employer to know about that until it becomes final. Ranging from potentially missing out on raises or promotions to flat out dismissal. All for a decision they haven't yet made. That's not a risk everyone is going to be prepared to take. 

If you need to visit a doctor or hospital, you are not fit for work. This is nothing that you need approval for. You notify your manager and any other position that needs to know in your company. You go there. You get a proof (like a sick note). Hospitals will be equipped to handle this, just ask. 

All you have is hearsay from others. If the minority workers on your shift are discriminated against, they should call the hotline and present their facts. You have nothing. You have guys saying that in unspecified events, unspecified person were treated differently than in this case, where you don't even know what happened exactly to the guy in question. All you know is he wasn't fired. In your case, you have no proof at all that it was discrimination. They might have decided exactly the same if it had been someone else. You cannot possibly know. A hotline cannot somehow work magic. You can call them but that will end up nowhere. If you want to make a difference, collect some data they can work with. Who was discriminated against? When How do you know it was discrimination (i.e. who was treated differently when)?. Until you have at least collected basic facts, yes, you will look problematic. Not because of discrimination issues, but because you are gossiping. 

You might consider replying to this individual if he is a recruiter working to place you with another company. If not, simply ignore it as irrelevant. You say he said: 

If it is indeed alienating your peers, then it's probably going to negatively impact your work and productivity. And "don't broadcast it" isn't the same thing as hide it. I would suggest that what was meant was more "don't make a big deal about it, and don't abuse it" rather than "just make sure no one sees you leave". Just a guess of course, but given your description of the culture, it sounds like "don't broadcast it" probably means something like "don't say you are leaving at 2 on Friday on Monday". If this is indeed the culture that management wants, then they probably perceive it as being relaxed and casual -- on Fridays, you work until you get to a good stopping point and then take off, not that the work week is 36 hours. As for your actual question -- I suggest that you don't do things that make you uncomfortable. That isn't meant to say go along. You have to decide which is worse, going along or alienating your co-workers. Best solution is to somehow resolve the issue -- either you becoming comfortable with going along, or helping your co-workers become comfortable with you not going along. 

Unfortunately there is only one answer here Business is business is business Let's see the situation from the market's point of view. Bob works for Acme who has a contract with Initech. Initech does not agre with Bob's personal issues, could they be 1) political ideas, 2) religious faith, 3) affiliation to labour associations, 4) health status or 5) sexual habits/orientation. I chose the above 5 to match my country's privacy regulator for the definition of "hypersensitive personal information". Initech is basically bullying Acme for letting Bob out or more in general to pressure behaviour against Bob, who for instance is not involved in any criminal activities. This is also called lobbying, under some circumstances. Unless Initech is subject to a religious regulation (since few religious laws exists around the world) so that not only companies must comply with ethical/moral rules dictated by law, but must also demand their customers/suppliers chain to comply with same rules, Initech is simply attempting to show force against Acme to take economic advantage. Porter depicts both the customer's and the supplier's contract force among the five. There are two edge cases: 

Well, that is in the eye of your interviewer. We cannot tell what they were looking for, how they weighted the results with all the other indicators or how the other candidates did. 

In the long run, yes. But the company is probably not hiring you to get a job done 5 years down the road when you know PHP well enough. Most likely, they want to get a job done now. In PHP. And with a skill level that is above "I just tried it for the first time". Problem solving is an important skill. But so is knowing your tool. The good thing is, the later can be learned. But most likely, a company will not pay you to learn PHP on company time when people that already know PHP are available. Sorry for ranting a bit, but I have come across a lot of consultants who think that problem solving is better than knowing the tool. It's not. Even a great solution can be brought down by a mediocre implementation. If you think you can solve problems while learning PHP, then that must be completely trivial problems. But people with trivial problems don't need great problem solvers. They need cheap and skilled coders. There is no harm telling your contact what you believe. What can happen? Worst case, they do not hire you. So what, they seem to want to hire someone else right now, so there is really nothing to lose. But before you make that phonecall, ask yourself if you would want to be the customer of the guy who learns his tools on the job. Would you be happy to fly with the pilot that says "I have never flown this kind of plane before, but how hard can it be, lets just get it on"? 

Asking "has anyone ever" is a waste of time. Unless it's something like "gone to Mars" or "travelled from NY to Singapore in less than an hour" the answer is yes. As for whether it comes with a bump in salary, that depends upon the cost of employing them through the staffing company. If the staffing company was getting 20%, I would expect the employee to get a pay cut, not a raise. 

Your question is a bit off. A reward is given for a one time effort that exceeds expectations. You give a reward to someone returning your wallet (with or without the valuables in) because they could have just ignored it and done nothing It doesn't sound like you want to reward them for staying late, working a month straight or having a brillant insight or any other onetime event. Instead, you are describing them as more valuable employees -- they do better work more consistently. This should be recognized not with a one time reward, but with higher salary or other permanent benefit. A higher salary isn't a reward, it's a recognition of the value you put on their work, and how hard it would be to get someone else to do the same work. You may recognize that they were more valuable employees than you previosuly thought over the course of a project, but ultimately it's not the project (or it's success) or even how much they contributed to it that should drive your actions. It's really about how you value their work and how easy it is to get the same quality and quantity of work. 

There is no set structure for companies, not even in Germany. Ask your direct supervisor ("Direkter Vorgesetzter" / "Disziplinarischer Vorgesetzter") he will now how to handle this. Don't do this in public. Take him aside, ask for a one-on-one or wait for the next one if one is already scheduled. 

If you apply for leadership roles, then any kind of leadership experience is a plus. If non-professional leadership experience like Toastmasters or sports clubs are your only leadership experience, you may want to include a sentence or two about how you think that specific experience will apply to the job you apply for. Personally, I have never heard of Toastmasters, but they have a professional looking website and (at least in my language) a funny name, so it's something to make you stand out from the other CVs in a positive way. I'd say include it. Maybe HR will find it positive, I cannot think of an instance where they'd see it negative. There's little risk and a potential gain.
