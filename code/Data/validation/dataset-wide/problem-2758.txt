You might want to look at the arguments made with regard to the philosophy of David Benatar, a professor of philosophy at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. I realize you mentioned he does not see himself as a pro-mortalist but this paper may be of interest to you nonetheless. Benatar’s anti-natalism equates to pro-mortalism paper 

Many valid points have been made by the previous contributors. I would propose that one could argue it is better to save 5 people versus 1 person if one accepts the premise, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, that people are inherently “good” and, therefore, it is morally superior to have more “good” people survive. Granted, we are left with the dilemma that perhaps all 5 people who are saved turn out to be “bad” and the 1 fatality is a “saint”. But, unfortunately, we don’t posses this foreknowledge. I think the approach is worthy of consideration. I also suspect that some would say this is just utilitarianism in disguise. But the choice is based solely on the morality of “good” versus “bad” and not on which makes the most people “happy” and/or which is more “useful”. 

The only mention of "loose" and "dense" philosophy that I have run across is within Rosicrucian Philosophy where the following distinction is applied: '... humanity today is divided into two classes - those in whom the connection between the vitai body and the dense body is very close and another class where the connection is more loose." In summary - The dense class is engaged in more material pursuits. The loose class is engaged in more spiritual pursuits. I realize that many may not take Rosicrucian Philosophy seriously and perceive it as being esoteric. But it is the only place where the terms "dense" and "loose" seem to appear (at least in my experience). Accepting this, I would say the image expresses "dense" philosophy. 

If you need a proof on this question, then it's fair, on a wider scale, to say nothing can be proved at all. What can you prove if you have no postulates? Or in other words, what are possible postulates for this case? In fact, no one has satisfactorily proved it through history. On the other hand, people do say "life is just a dream". It's not just casual, it has serious implications, especially on the ground of multi-life/reincarnation hypothesis. But anyway it stays a metaphor subject to interpretations. 

Firstly, the two English words can be understood differently through times and geographies. For example, eudaimonia means literally well-classed spirit and is translated as "happiness". The difference is too remarkable. "Pleasure" in hedonism can be used interchangeably with "happiness". So it is safe as long as concerned in philosophy, no clear lines are important. It depends on your philosophical position to go further into concepts such as eudaimonia, provided they are not precisely "happiness". You can't understand a theist being atheist. 

In general, others have pointed out nothing prevents happiness to come with moral duty fulfillment. On the other side, we pick up a life risk to analyze, other kinds of risks vary at great scales and should not be treated the same. To risk someone's life to perform moral duties is counter-intuitive and counter-instinct. It roots from the question: what is/are more (valuable) than a life? An easy answer might be "many lives are"!!! Hang on a minute, are you serious? Based on what metric system or criteria? are those many lives of the same kind of the referenced life and how same? who is/are the judge?... such kind of questions will push the initiator back at the wall with noway out. Life is the most complicated concept in any areas of study. Therefore to discuss or make statements about it requires a lot more than just a few quotes. 

While it is difficult to put a firm date on it, more and more philosophers became atheists with the dawn of the scientific revolution and the subsequent waning of the Catholic Church's influence over philosophical thought. Some may date this as early as the 1500s or later (1700s). Suffice it to say that as science grew so did an atheistic outlook from philosophers. Now, of course, there were (and are) exceptions as there were ancient Greek philosophers who were atheist (Empedocles) and modern philosophers who were not (Antony Flew). There have been several surveys conducted, the validity of which can be debated endlessly. After reading a few of these surveys, I would put the percentage of atheist philosophers between 62-72%. The rest are roughly divided evenly between theists and "other". What percentage of philosophers believe in God? Why 62% of Philosophers are Atheists (Part I) The Largest-Ever Survey of Philosophers: What Do They Believe? Why Are So Many Scientists And Philosophers Atheists?

I believe Cicero has said/written "justice renders to everyone his due" but Justinian comes closer having said/written "to give to each his own". In short, both argued that this leads to a "just" society. Whether that conclusion is true or not is, of course, a matter of debate. Assuming one takes these two as saying the same thing, Cicero (Roman politician) said it prior to Justinian (Byzantine Emperor). 

Firstly, symmetry is only absolute in Math, not in Math-Physics (search for Closer to Truth interview videos on Symmetry). So while putting a physical coin in distribution of flips, it's the jurisdiction of Math-Physics hence no good sense. Nevertheless, intuitively, the coin symmetry is only one among many parameters such as the surrounding air or liquid, electromagnetic fields, ... that if are stripped off, again makes little sense in terms of truths other than approximation. Clearly it's analytic. 

It rather depends on you than on the book or things therein. When you find a matching between your mind or soul's ingredients and the interpretants from the book (For interpretant - Refer C.S Pierce on Semiotic), the chance of being convinced increases and so on. God to each soul is likely to be different in some way, despite many could think they are worshiping the same God. So it doesn't matter it's true or at least convinced to others as well. Such matching is sufficient to make you convinced. In another way, even if others are convinced, you may be not - no matchings or not sufficiently. 

I am addressing the question in a rather indirect way as I believe there's no resolute direct answer. For example: the assumed clearest evidence of any type on this topic is Libet's experiment. Nevertheless, I would agree with the criticisms on it and his own view rather than with a variety of bestowed conclusions. Libet "believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action"(Wikipedia) My answer is freewill has too many different versions of definition, each with its own ground and purpose. Besides it requires insights from Neurology and psychiatry which have not reached maturity sufficiently enough to have a resolute thesis. Philosophy appears to be the only way for thought experiments but you can't set aside theological sides of it. 

A key idea of the Objectivist philosophy is that arguments must be made in terms of essentials for conclusions to be valid and validatable. This is why, for example, the concept of a human as a rational animal leads to fewer flawed conclusions than other not essential descriptions such as “the animal that makes tools” or the “animal that that is social.” Rationality is the key distinguishing factor according to Aristotle, and Rand. Monkeys can make tools; dolphins and ants can be social, but only humans reason, and reason is the key differentiating factor. We cannot definitively determine the truth of idea like whether Rand was a philosopher merely by a survey. In principle, to understand whether or not Rand was a philosopher, you must first define your terms and answer questions like “What is a philosopher?” “What essential characteristics do philosophers have?” “Does Rand, in particular have these essential characteristics?” The definition must be arrived at by a process of abstraction resulting from the examination of multiple, particular examples of philosophers and noting the common elements. Definitions like “lover or wisdom” or “thinker” are not sufficient because they obviously include people outside the field. Something like “someone who thinks about the human condition in essential terms” is closer to the mark as is “a person who advances knowledge in the fields of metaphysics (ontology), epistemology (logic), ethics, politics, and aesthetics.” These fields are the branches philosophy according to Aristotle (a philosopher) and Rand (under consideration here). The question of why Rand continues to be regarded as a philosopher is a question in terms of non-essentials. Instead the question should focus on whether or not Rand was a philosopher. Facts are not determined by results of an opinion survey or by fiat. Also, it may indicate that you have already reached the conclusion (meaning you are no longer thinking) that Rand is not a philosopher and now you merely wonder why so many other people are wrong about this. If you are convinced of your position, offer facts and logical arguments supporting your position. If you cannot do this, check your premises, you may be incorrect. Be careful with the Gene H. Bell-Villada quote above. He mischaracterizes rather than argues here. Specifically, to characterize an “aggressively atheistic” philosophy based on “reason” as a “theology” with “scriptures” suggests that either he does not understand the words he is using or that he is up to something more sinister. The term epistemology in philosophy refers to a manner of knowing. How do we know and validate knowledge? “Psycho-epistemology” is a term Rand created to describe the cognitive processes involving interactions between the conscious mind and the automatic functions of the subconscious mind. (see “The Psycho-Epistemology of Art” The Romantic Manifesto.) Ironically, after Bell-Villada dismisses the term “psycho-epistemology” he complains that “she and her friends have little to say about…experience or intuition.” Experience creates the content of the subconscious. This content allows rapid evaluation of the current situation in the form of emotions or intuition. The detailed examination of these phenomena is psycho-epistemology. I am convinced that Rand is a philosopher but neither my certainty that she is nor Bell-Villada’s certainty that she is not should convince you. Instead, think for yourself. Read her non-fiction and determine on your own if her ideas are “loosely connected” or if they form a logically-consistent, well-connected philosophical system. After that you will be able to fully understand that the reason libertarians like her so much is that she provides a strong, rational foundation for the idea of liberty and freedom: based on a knowable universe, and reason as the means of knowing, humans must be free to act in accordance with their reason. This leads to the ideas that a proper government has the sole function of protecting individual rights so that individuals can act according to their reason and keep the products of their efforts without slavery or sacrifice of any kind.
