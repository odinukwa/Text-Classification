You should be surprised. Because that never happens when someone who really has a position for you contacts you. Meaning, they are puffing up your ego. Why? Read on. 

I think this is key. First, anything on your resume is ordered from top to bottom; important to not so important. And if you have been placing it at the bottom of your resume—I hate to say this—but it is definitely not a major factor in anyone accepting or rejecting your resume. Anything at the bottom of your resume instantly has less weight. So that said it has never really hurt or helped anything. Pretty confident of that. So perhaps you can continue to list it, but your call. 

You know what, one slap in the face by a woman is not enough to justify the mental anguish you seem to be in. I genuinely will give you some advice: Go to a therapist and face up to your actions as well as the reactions of others to it. 

There should be regular meetings with whoever you are working with, correct? That’s really the only place you should ask for—or expect—feedback. And if you are not getting feedback, there must be an intern coordinator or an H.R. person you can talk about the issue with. So talk to them & be cool about it. Nothing wrong with being interested in different aspects of a company. I would be 100% honest with your supervisor & just say, “I like being a developer, but I am curious about finance. Is there anyone I can reach out to?” I doubt that would be looked upon as a bad thing. “Should I be the guy who organizes lunch together…” If you want to force yourself on people, go for it! But it might be best to let the social network grow naturally & just see how the culture operates. There will most likely be time to mingle, but as an intern if you attempt to force a pseudo-meeting over an awkward lunch you will not make a positive impression. 

Do you have a common area where people gather? Water cooler? Pantry? Small staff break room? If their gifts are food, then just open up the box of chocolates, place it in the pantry & let everyone have some of it. Now, this does’t necessarily work in small groups, but in large organizations it’s an easy way to deflect these kind of gifts. If it’s an object, your call on what to do. But I do not recommend displaying them as trophies. That really sends the wrong message to other people on staff. I have known a few co-workers—not management—who would have items on their desk clearly on display as trophies of what they were able to get from others & it’s just obnoxious. 

That sounds horrible. The solution? Take the high road. Clearly work with your manager define goals & expectations on whatever project you are working on with them. And meet them. If the co-worker still treats you badly despite you doing good work, who looks better/worse in that scenario? You who are making an effort or this co-worker who is sabotaging your ability to perform. Past that, does the company you work for have a human resources department? It’s clear management knows about this scenario, but if I were you I would write down specifically what happened in this incident. And keep a log of any future incidents. Go to human resources & clearly state that you & your manager are attempting to work within this odd scenario, but you are giving H.R. notification in the form of a “heads up” just in case things escalate. 

If they are sending you an automated reply, it means you will never determine the reasoning nor will they drop what they are doing to follow up and provide feedback. That said, you should not take automated replies like this too personally. The reality is it could mean either they feel you are unqualified or: 

You already have chosen an answer, and some people vaguely touch on this, but what this boils down to is something really simple: Irregardless of how simple or complex a project might be, you need to be in control of the structure of your project from the beginning. The less you plan, the more you will fall into an endless development cycle. You need to set clear boundaries so the client gets what they want & you get what you want. The reality is unless this person knows you, the chances of you getting out extra fees at this point are zero. That said, this could be a case where after this project is done you have a talking point of, “Well, that last project had issues. If you want to work with me on a new project, this is what we need to do.” Meaning leverage this failure towards future successes! That said, it’s taken me decades to perfect how I handle these situations. But logically you yourself need to divide things up along these lines. 

I initially commented that I could not think of a good way to avoid a situation like this, but I think I have a possible solution. The key is not your resume, but your cover letter. Basically, in your cover letter you are supposed to articulate why you want to leave a current position. Instead, perhaps you can spin the cover letter to say something like, “I really enjoy the position I have right now. And feel confident in the organization I am in. But I would like to informationally explore what other options there are for me in this field.” By phrasing it like that you are basically stating, “I like my job. I like what I do. I like who I work for. But I am also curious about the larger world.” Now mind you this might all backfire. Your current employers could simply see the act of you applying for any position as a sign of your desire to leave the company. But I think this way you reseat the concept of wanting to interview because you are “rusty” into more of a curiosity angle. Where you are simply interested in the larger world of your career to begin with. 

This “benefit” is not unique to the startup or any startup or any company for that matter that has full time staff. Health care (aka: health insurance) is a common benefit most any company offer full time—and some part-time staff—as part of a standard package offered to employees. So this is not special. That said, I believe I understand why you believe you can somehow negotiate the value of such a plan with your overall compensation: Many human resources departments—or people acting as such in a small company—will often tag a raw dollar “value” to benefits like this to make it seem like your compensation is tons more than it is. So—for arguments sake—someone in the company will tell you that you are going to be hired at a salary of $90,000 (for example) but the benefits are “so amazing” that they add up to $20,000-$30,000 on top of your base compensation… So it’s like you are getting paid $110,000 to $120,000 and isn’t that “Amazing™!” This is “truthiness” at it’s best: Yes, those benefits might add up to an equivalent of $20,000-$30,000 if you were to purchase and use similar services on your own, but—as you point out—you might not ever need those things so the net value is $0 to you. Everyone knows that is the deal, but the nature of group benefits like this prevents any one-to-one equivalent in negotiating that discounted value with a raw dollar figure. Meaning, utterly no company in the world will ever say, “Okay this new hire doesn’t need insurance so let’s just give them the dollar difference in their gross salary.” If anything you even asking a question like this might make the company think you are simply naive and that might negatively impact your ability to be hired by the company. That said, even if your parents have coverage my advice to you is to only fall back to that if you have no choice. If you are an adult and are being offered a real job at a real company, it’s time to be a part of the real world and be independent. 

Nope. Never. Showing you worked for somewhere for less than 6 months only has value in an internship. 

It’s taken me a long time to truly realize my heart and soul can only exist for my own projects. And if my own projects dovetail with my employers, all the better. But at the end of the day, they own your work and you own yourself. 

Why do you care about whether someone can pronounce your last name right or wrong? My real last name—which is fairly Eastern European in origin—is complex by U.S./Western basic pronunciation standards. At no point in my life or career have I felt the need to phonetically “spell out” my name to make anyone’s life easier. It’s your name. It’s your personal identity. It’s not your problem if someone can’t pronounce it right. And in my case, I have found the relative complexity to be a bonus when interviewing or meeting new people: Their reaction as to how to pronounce or deal with the name is a good leading indicator to me of how the rest of the conversation/relationship will go. For example, my first name is quite easy… So if someone calls me, says my first name and then either spells my last name or politely says, “Sorry I am having trouble pronouncing this…” I know I will have a fairly casual interaction with them. Usually I will pronounce my name for them, they will repeat what I said and then we move onto business. On the other hand, if their railroad their way through my name without any sign of humility or trouble on their part, I know I am dealing with a fairly cocksure/arrogant person and this might not go well. In general, if I came across any resume or correspondence that had a phonetic spelling of someone’s name on it, I would treat that correspondence as weird and odd. Like what is the person trying to prove? What makes them feel so special they need to do this? Like I said, you should not have to apologize for your name and identity and generally in any society your name will be respected as-is since it is your name and personal identity. 

First, before anything you need to face the solid realities: This gig was 2 months & they do not want you there. They could be right, they could be wrong. But in general, this is not good. Fair warning, but the reality is the past 6 months need to just disappear from your resume. But that said, here are the specifics: 

He says, “my” in both cases. Never “our” or “the company’s.” It’s him saying “my tax guy” and “my lawyer.” Then there is this: 

So you are frozen in the wake of this co-worker? That is you actually giving this co-worker’s claim validity. You should end the issue once & for all by working cooperatively with your co-worker, allow their non-cooperative behavior to shine through, and—as said before—if/when the task ends & your process wins, the net result is you created something that works while your co-worker just complains & does not work cooperatively. Which means you truly win in the end.
