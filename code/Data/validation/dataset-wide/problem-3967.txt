We say that two (irreducible) algebraic varieties $X$ and $Y$ are stably birational if $X \times \mathbb{P}^n$ is birational to $Y\times \mathbb{P}^n$ for some $n\ge 0$. The natural question is then the following: if $X$ and $Y$ are stably birational, then are they birational? For the case of curves, it is an easy exercise to show that it is true. Does someone has a reference for this? The case of surfaces is also true, I think (again I would be happy to have a reference). For large dimension, I only know the result of Beauville, Colliot-Thélène, Sansuc, Swinnerton-Dyer (Annals of Math 1985), which says that the answer to the above question is no in general. Are there more recent results/examples in this direction? 

I have a metric space $X$ and a graph $G=(V,E)$ whose set of vertices is a subset $V\subset X$ (and $E$ is the set of edges, which is a symmetric subset of $V\times V$). For each $v\in V$, the set of neighbours of $v$ (elements of $V$ that lie on the same edge as $v$) is infinite and the distance between $v$ and its neighbours is unbounded. However, I have some good properties: (1) There is a group of isometries of $X$ that preserves the set $V$ and the set of edges, with finitely many orbits (on the set of vertices), so we can study what happens locally. (2) The graph is connected. (3) The paths of $V$ have good properties. Given two elements $v,w\in V$, I will say that a path of length $n$ between $v$ and $w$ is given by $v=v_0,v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n=w$, all vertices of $V$, where $(v_i,v_{i+1})\in E$ for each $i$. Then, for all $v,w\in V$, we can find a path between $v$ and $w$ of minimal length by the following algorithm: we define $v_0=v$, and then for $i\ge 1$, choose $v_i$ in the set of neighbours of $v_{i-1}$ to have minimal distance (in $X$) with $w$. This way is not unique, but all paths produced have the same length, which is the minimal length of paths between $v$ and $w$. My question is then the following: can we interpret (3) by some geometric way? Is there a name for this? Does it have some good natural properties? For example, what does it say about the embedding of metric spaces $V\hookrightarrow X$ (where we endow $V$ with the metric given by the graph distance) ? It is certainly not isometric as edges have unbounded distance but maybe it is not too bad? Thanks for your help. PS: I am not at all expert in graph theory, the graph I am talking about comes from algebraic geometry. 

For some research work, I need to know the classification of elements of finite order of $\mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{Q})$, up to conjugation. Since I essentially need $n\le 4$, I think that I can show it by hand, using cyclotomic extensions and Galois theory, but is there some work in the literature on this? EDIT: Looking at the possible orders is essentially trivial in $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Q})$, by just looking at the cyclotomic polynomials. The conjugacy classes require a little more work but are easy exercises, at least in low dimension. For $\mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{Q})$, the case of orders prime to $n$ follows essentially from the case of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Q})$, the orders are more interesting. 

No, the corresponding map is not étale. The morphism $\tilde{X}\to X$ is basically the identification of the two points $x_1$ and $x_2$. Around the singularity of $X$, there are thus two "branches", corresponding to the image of the neighbourhood of $x_1$ and $x_2$. If you glue $y_1$ with $z_1$, then a neighbourhood of the point obtained will be send only on one branch, and will be locally a $2:1$-map. The map is thus not étale. It should be possible to do it in affine coordinates if you want. 

It is true that the surface obtained is a special one (for example, a general cubic surface admits no automorphism). In fact, taking coordinates $X,Y,Z$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$, the cubic curve is given by $F(X,Y,Z)$ for some polynomial of degree $3$ and the equation of the surface is $W^3=F(X,Y,Z)$. The automorphism corresponds to send $(W:X:Y:Z)$ onto $(aW:X:Y:Z)$ where $a$ is a $3$-rd root of unity. As you said, the orbit of a line $E\subset S$ of the surface consists of three lines $E, \sigma(E), \sigma^2(E)$ with $E+\sigma(E)+\sigma^2(E)=\pi^{-1}(l)$ where $l$ is an inflexion line of $\mathbb{P}^2$. Note that $E+\sigma(E)+\sigma^2(E)$ is equal to the trace of an hyperplane of $\mathbb{P}^3$, in particular each intersects transversally the two others: $E\cdot \sigma(E)=E\cdot \sigma^2(E)=\sigma(E)\cdot \sigma^2(E)=1$. I will use the same notation as you and write $\phi\colon S\to \mathbb{P}^2$ a birational morphism which is the blow-up of $6$ points. I denote by $E_1,\dots,E_6$ the six curves contracted and by $L\in \mathrm{Pic}(S)$ the pull-back of a general line of $\mathbb{P}^2$. Then $\mathrm{Pic}(S)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^7$ with basis $L,E_1,\dots,E_6$. The $27$ lines correspond to: $E_i$, $i=1,...,6$, $F_{ij}=L-E_i-E_j$ (line through two points) for $i\not=j$ and $G_j=2L-\sum_{i\not= j} E_i$ (conics through $5$ points). Because $\sigma(E_1)\cdot E_1=\sigma^2(E_1)\cdot E_1=1$, $\sigma(E_1),\sigma^2(E_1)$ are equal to $F_{1i}$ or $G_j$ for $i,j\not=1$. Because $\sigma^2(E_1)\cdot \sigma(E_1)=1$, we have moreover $i=j$. The orbit of $E_1$ is thus $(E_1,F_{1i},G_i)$ for some $i\not=1$. Doing the same for $E_2,...,E_6$ we find a permutation $\tau$ of $(1,...,6)$ without fix points such that the orbit of $E_i$ is {$E_i, F_{i,\tau(i)},G_{\tau(i)}$} for $i=1,...,6$. Because the image by $\sigma$ and $\sigma^2$ of the set {$E_1,...,E_6$} is $6$ skew lines, we can find that these two sets contain three of the $G_i$ and three $F_{i,j}$. Up to permutation of the curves $E_i$, we have then $E_1\to F_{12}\to G_2$ $E_2\to F_{23}\to G_3$ $E_3\to F_{13}\to G_1$ $E_4\to G_5\to F_{45}$ $E_5\to G_6\to F_{56}$ $E_6\to G_4\to F_{46}$ The image of the other lines is induced by these maps. We can for example easily write the matrix of $\sigma$ relatively to the basis $L,E_1,...,E_6$. (in particular, it corresponds to a birational map of $\mathbb{P}^2$ of degree $4$). The matrix is $[4,1,1,1,2,2,2]$ $[-2,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1]$ $[-2,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1]$ $[-2,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]$ $[-1,0,0,0,-1,-1,0]$ $[-1,0,0,0,0,-1,-1]$ $[-1,0,0,0,-1,0,-1]$ 

My question concerns morphisms between algebraic spaces. I like the definitions of Artin, but I do not see a simple proof of the fact that the composition of two morphisms is a morphism. Could someone explain to me how to get it? I recall the definitions to see what I exactly mean. In the book of Artin, an algebraic space is given by an affine scheme $A$, together with a closed equivalence relation $R\subset A\times A$ such that the projections $R\to A$ are étale morphisms. Then, a morphism from a scheme $X$ to the algebraic space obtained is defined as a "graph" which is a closed subset $W\subset X\times A$ such that the projection $W\to X$ is surjective and étale and such that the pull-back of any point corresponds to an equivalence class of $A$. This naturally induces a map from the points of $X$ to the points of $A$. A morphism from an algebraic space $A/R$ to another one $A'/R'$ is just a morphism $A\to A'/R'$ which is compatible with the equivalence relation $R$. Given two morphisms $A/R\to A'/R'$ and $A'/R'\to A''/R''$, the composition should be a morphism. I see how to construct the graph in $A\times A''$, taking the projection of the closed of $A\times A'\times A''$ where the first two elements and the last two elements give elements of the corresponding two graphs of the previous morphisms. However, why is the graph obtained closed and why is the projection étale?
