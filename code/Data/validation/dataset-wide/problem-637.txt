Tainio et al, (Can air pollution negate the health benefits of cycling and walking?, Preventive Medicine, June 2016, Vol.87:233â€“236), produced a model for cycling (and walking) in polluted cities, using data of one particular type of pollution (fine particulate matter) from various global cities. Using a measure of minutes per day spent cycling, they find that the health benefits of cycling have a "tipping point" (after which no further benefits are observed) and a "break even point", after which the harm due to pollution outweighs the benefits of the exercise. The authors claim that, in almost all urban environments, the benefits of cycling outweigh the harm. The most polluted city they looked at, Delhi, however, has a tipping point of 30 mins/day and a breakeven point of 45 mins/day, which must make it a pretty unpleasant place to cycle! The conclusion seems to me to be that if the choice is between cycling and driving, you're better off cycling (for any reasonable distance, such as commuting), because you'll be healthier and causing less pollution yourself. Personally, I like to avoid heavily polluted areas of my city for aesthetic reasons and also because they tend to be busier and slower than the alternatives. 

You have the seat stay mounts on the frame (those are the two thin tubes that go from the rear wheel drop outs to the top of the seat tube). What you need is mounts on the rear wheel drop outs. Typically, they are part of the dropout and/or frame. In your case, you have none. That being said, the P-Clips and Tubus Clamps will not be useful. The Tubus Adapter Set for Quick Release Axle Mounting should solve your problem. It is built for a Tubus rack which has two mounting holes at the bottom that are meant to be used simultaneously, thus the two slots. You can choose which one is appropriate once you loosely install the rack and check how level the top is. Installation instructions and a drawing to go with it can be found here. I should say I have not done this actual installation myself, but I see no obvious reason why this would affect anything else. There are comments from people that have used this with discs and there's a spacer to keep the mounting plate away from the frame, so you should be good. The only concern I have is there seems to be nothing to prohibit the mounting plate from rotating fore or aft. You may want to invest in a couple lock washers and a proportionally longer quick release. 

Pumps have an air chamber (normally cylindrical) that is compressed in order to force the air into the tyre. When the handle is pulled out, air behind the piston is forced out of the cylinder. In single action pumps, this air is vented into the atmosphere and lost (no big deal; there's plenty of it around!). On a double (or dual) action pump, this air is collected and forced through the valve into the tyre. Single action pumps are mechanically simpler, and so smaller and lighter than equivalent double action pumps, but take roughly twice as many strokes to get to the same pressure. With a double action pump, you have to do work when pulling the pump handle, as well as when pushing, which is more effort per stroke (due to the pressure of the air already in the tyre, unlike in the single action pump, where you're working against atmospheric pressure which is much lower). 

Most shops don't carry spare parts for STI shifters. Most problems are internal and even if you can get spare parts, the cost in labor to replace most things (except clamps, hoods, and name plates) coupled with the cost of the spares exceeds the cost of a whole new unit. The piece you need is called an outer support unit. Shimano does have part numbers for individual pieces like that, but in general, you'll have to go direct to Shimano to get them. The biggest bike distributor in America doesn't have them. This makes them a little harder to attain. And then there's the other problem: you have old Sora components. Generally, Shimano engineers new stuff and drops support for the old, at least when it comes to spares. That being said, you might look around but I'd say you have an incredibly small chance of finding the replacement part. Not too mention, as I implied earlier, it's not trivial to replace things on STIs. If you're willing to take it on, you'll generally be on your own, as few shops do such repairs. If you're ambitious, I'd just try to find a broken shifter that you can scavenge the piece from. Another thing you could do is hack it. Fabricate a sleeve to cover over the housing stop that goes as far as your barrel adjuster. It might just be enough. Make sure the inner diameter is as close as possible to the outer diameter of the stop. I'd suggest something that isn't going to be too annoying if it rattles, which it probably will. This is one case where carbon fiber might be useful! ;-) If you use this for competitive purposes, professional (on Sora? Probably not), amateur, or just for fun, I'd suggest STIs. Otherwise, bar end shifters are a technology that has been around a long time. They're simple and anyone can figure them out. Plus, the friction mode is very useful. I'd give it some serious thought if you don't mind moving your hands off the lever to shift. 

As we will see... Firstly, they define "footway", and state that it's not generally lawful to cycle on one: 

This is one of those questions where if you have to ask "should I do this?", the answer is "no". Carbon frames need to be specially reinforced (during manufacturing) in the areas that drilling takes place see, for example, this discussion, and you could create stress concentration points or otherwise compromise the integrity of your frame. The words "catastrophic frame failure" are not ones that you want to hear, particularly from your hospital bed. 

The consequences for you as an individual are perhaps not as important as the broader ramifications of your behaviour. By behaving as if you think that the local rules of the road don't apply to you, you are contributing to a perception that cyclists are dangerous idiots who disregard the rules and the safety of themselves and others. This has the effect of making other road users much less sympathetic about the needs of cyclists as a whole. This can result in more dangerous behaviour from motorists, which is a battle that the cyclists will only come off worse in. If cyclists are seen as unpleasant or dangerous, we are much less likely to be effective in campaigning for better provision in terms of infrastructure such as segregated bike lanes, safer parking and so on. 

As an ex racing cyclist who would regularly ride 100km per day just for training and 210km on a sunday club run I'd say your not giving yourself much of a chance here as riding that distance even over 3 days is not easy for a non cyclist.. You really need to be bike fit for a 330km ride, especially if there are time constraints. Training sets you up properly and will make the difference between the ride being an enjoyable experience and a painful slog. You may start off fine on your first 50km or so and think everything is going well.. But with no miles or training under your belt you'll soon be suffering from muscle fatigue & cramps.. Not to mention the increased chance of injury. Also be aware of the other pains associated with starting to ride a bike... Like wrist, butt and arm pain, these will normally pass but it takes a few weeks for everything to settle-in, assuming that the new bike fits you properly and is adjusted up well. I'm not trying to put you off here.. just trying to make you aware of what you can expect. I'll still wish you all the best on your endeavour.. & BTW.. Stay fuelled-up & hydrated. 

The way he's riding is bad because it damages your bike. That in itself ought to be enough reason to stop. You could point out that all the effort spent pushing the bike from side to side is wasted; he could use he energy more effectively to push the bike forwards using the pedals. I suspect that if your friend was riding his own bike, he'd be less cavalier about his treatment of it. I'd be inclined to say one of the following things to him: 

It seems to me (neither a Scot nor a lawyer), that it's generally illegal to cycle along Scottish pavements (using the UK interpretation of "pavement": "sidewalk" in the US). According to a briefing for the Scottish Parliament: 

Same frame material. Not sure why it's not more detailed on the Elite specs, but there are several shops marketing it that reference the same frame materials as the Comp, like this one. Makes sense when you think about it. The Comp and Elite ultimately refer to different component packages (just like those annoying and less meaningful letters that come after car models), though I'm not sure why they don't just call the frame an AWOL! 

Mostly, the different designations are there to encourage whole component group sales. As a general rule (not an absolute one), you can mix and match derailleurs and chainrings with other parts, but only with a one speed difference and with the other parts being the lesser speed. In other words, 8 speed chain, shifter, and cassette (these three must match except for 6-8 speeds) are ok with 9 speed elsewhere, but not 10. Realize that there is usually a difference in chain width, so there are potential exceptions to this rule. 

This (official) guidance seems to say that pavements are not generally covered by the Land Reform Act (because "access is controlled by or under another enactment"), but there are exceptions. It's not clear to me how to determine whether something is a "core path"; I think it's determined by Local Authorities rather than centrally. The briefing goes on to say: 

This looks like it's generally illegal to cycle along Scottish pavements (using the UK interpretation of "pavement": "sidewalk" in the US). Next, they look at the Act mentioned in the question: 

Note that different types of bike are designed for different purposes. You've tagged this as "road"; we generally want road bikes to move forward efficiently, but BMX riding (for example) is very different. It sounds a bit like your friend isn't used to this kind of distinction.
