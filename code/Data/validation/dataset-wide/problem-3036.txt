New Zealand is usually credited to be the last significant area on Earth to have been colonized by human beings in the sense of the question; as the first settlers seem to have arrived in the late 1200CE. By contrast, there are signs of human settlements on Madagascar dating from the beginning of the common era and records of trade with the island dating from around 700CE, so half a millennia before anyone stepped foot on New-Zealand (and indeed, even Iceland seems to have been colonized much later than Madagascar). 

Pieter Geerkens answer is excellent and should be selected, but I want to add a few well-known facts which show that the "brutal statistic" is actually wrong by an order of magnitude. Western Front 1940 More than 2,200,000 French soldiers fought on the Western Front in 1940. This alone dwarfs the total number of any kind of military personnel under Vichy-France, of which only a fraction fought for the Axis. French Free Forces before Operation Torch It is not so easy to determine the relative size of the Forces Françaises Libres compared to Vichy-France in the Levant and Madagascar campaigns. About 100,000 troops from Vichy-France seem to have fought these campaigns. In late 1942, there were 60,000 Forces Françaises Libres. French Liberation Army In 1943, after their fusion with the African Armies, the FFL became the French Liberation Army. 72,000 men fought in Tunisia, 100,000 in Italy and 267,000 in the liberation of France (mostly in Operation Dragoon). Again, these forces alone seem to outnumber the total number of military personnel of Vichy-France. French Forces after the liberation In september 1944, so after the liberation of Paris, the French Liberation Army numbered 550,000. In december 1944, 1,000,000. At the end of the war, 1,300,000. Conclusion At the beginning and the end of WWII, French forces fighting with the Allies outnumbered the maximum number of French forces fighting with the Axis by almost an order of magnitude. Frenchmen who "bore the arms" for the Axis were at most 300,000; and among them perhaps 100,000 or 150,000 actually fought. Why there is some truth in the assertion Depending on the context of the quote, though, I think there might be some truth in the assertion. Indeed, among the hundred of thousands who fought for the Forces Françaises Libres and the Armée de Libération, most were from France then colonial empire. So it is conceivably true that more metropolitan French bore arms for Vichy-France on the soil of metropolitan France in the late 1940/early 1944 period than metropolitan French bore arms for the Allies during the same period. And indeed, this fact is not easily discussed in the historiography of France. So with the qualifications "metropolitan French" and "from late 1940 to early 1944", the assertion might be correct. Without the qualifications, it verges on the insult to the French soldiers of 1940 and of the Armée Française de Libération. Update @jwentig correctly remarks that the answer did not account for the French volunteers and conscripts who fought in the Waffen-SS and other Axis units. In fact, a number seem hard to track down (leading credence to the accusation of uneasiness in the original quote). Nevertheless, I found this book which aims at a complete listing. It arrives at a total of 40,000 French soldiers for the Axis, so maybe 2% of the numbers who fought with the Allies. Among these, 18,000 to 22,000 fought voluntarily in the Waffen-SS according to Wikipedia, which is in fact rather low (compared for instance to the 40,000 from Belgium or Hungary and the 50,000 from the Netherlands, which all had a fraction of France's population). Another point that wasn't discussed in any answers so far, I think, is the case of forced conscriptions of former French citizens in the annexed part of Alsace and Moselle. There were about 130,000 so that even including them (which would seem quite historically unfair as well as inaccurate), the total number of Frenchmen arguably bearing arms for the Axis (total Vichy-France army plus French in German units plus forced conscriptions) hardly reaches 500,000. About one sixth of those who indisputably fought with the Allies. Sources Any reference about WWII, starting with Wikipedia. 

My understanding is that the Electromagnetic Pulse induced by a nuclear weapon is mainly due to the ionizing effect of the gamma rays released by the nuclear reaction. However, for this ionizing effect to produce a downward blast of electrons moving at relativistic speed to the ground (the cause of the voltage shock on the ground), the ionizing effect has to take place in a conducting medium. The atmosphere is a poor conducting medium below 10km so any nuclear explosion below this altitude only provokes a mild shock. Little Boy detonated at about 580m above the ground and Fat Man at about 500m above the ground. Beside altitude, the most significant factor determining the strength of the EMP is a the gamma rays yield, which is about 0,5% of the total energy yield of the detonation (according to Wiki). Little Boy had a total yield of of 16 kilotons of TNT. As you can see in the chart below, a 0,08 kiloton detonation yields a mild voltage shock even at high altitude. 

Encouraged by the kind words about my comment, I have turned it into an answer with more details and sources. The historiography of the impact of First World War on European science contains (at least) two distinct theses that D.Aubin and C.Goldstein dub the Bourbaki thesis and the Forman thesis in [1]. The two disagree on the impact of WWI on the pure science community (negative for the former, positive for the latter) but the two agree on one point: Germany and the rest of Europe had different conceptions of the integration of pure science in the war effort. In Germany, it was understood from the onset that scientists were to be integrated in the war effort to the full extent of their scientific capability (with, among the most notable figures, the tragic case of Fritz Haber [2]). In France and apparently England (I'm much less familiar with it), whereas scientists were certainly completely integrated in the war effort, it seems that they were mostly used to perform direct computations or considered as ordinary citizens and thus drafted and sent to the frontline. Also, it seems that Germany sent a wider generational spectrum of soldiers to the front, whereas France took a more specific policy (anyone in between a small interval). To take a concrete example, the two foremost institutions of higher science education in France were at the time (and still are) the École polytechnique and the École Normale Supérieure. The first is formally a military institution, so the entire promotion was of course mobilized and sent to serve in artillery. The second had a pretty astonishing casualty rate: 60% of the class of 1910 died in the war and by 1915, out of the 195 currently mobilized students, only 50 were alive and well. Now the two theses diverge. The Bourbaki thesis holds that this rate of casualty created a vacuum that impaired the development of French science in the 1920. Besides, the mathematicians who kept a scientific activity during the war moved towards applied science and it apparently took them some time to come back to purer science. The Forman thesis, named after [3], holds that the atmosphere of synergy between government and science created during the First World War I in Germany induced a spirit of science moving forward in the early 1920s (much more controversially, he also argued that the traumatic break-out induced a spirit of radical modernism in the Weimar republic which inspired pure science research, a statement that is very hard to historically substantiate). Whatever point of view is more correct, both agree that in one of the former centers of pre-war science (Paris, or more generally, France) pure science development was halted or at least deeply changed by WWI whereas in another (Göttingen, Berlin, more generally Germany) pure science development was preserved, perhaps even encouraged by WWI. Interestingly, WWII and the Nazi regime had apparently a symmetrical impact: it destroyed the German pure science community with disastrous long lasting impact, whereas the decades immediately after the war were a golden age for pure science in France, despite the crippling defeat and occupation it had endured.

The answer lies, I believe, in the obscure end of the Merovingian epoch and is quite hard to understand from a modern perspective seeing that the geopolitical entitles involved disappeared completely under the Carolingians (at the risk of being off-topic, I still remember fondly reading these stories as a child and not understanding a word, so foreign seemed the names and places referred to, even though the history was supposed to be that of France). So who were these tyrants? These tyrants were presumably on the one hand Plectrude, the widow of Pépin of Herstal (the father of Charles Martel, grand-father of Pépin le Bref and great-grand father of Charles the Great), on the other hand Ragenfred of Neustria and Radbod the Frisian. At the risk of repeating what you know very well, the kingdom of the Franks was then divided in a number of political entities, the two most central ones being Neustria (north-west, more or less anything between Britanny and Reims) and Austrasia (north-east, which is perhaps easy to describe in modern terms as, maybe not coincidentally, the battle grounds of the western front of WWI). In 715, Dagobert III died at the age of 16, having been the king for only 4 years without having exercised any power. For the last 4 years, the power had been in the hands of the Maire du palais, but it just so happened that Pépin de Herstal, the mayor of Austrasia, also had just died. So the situation was ripe for a bold power grab: no king, no mayor in Austrasia. More or less everybody had a go at it. Plectrude, the widow of Pépin and the richest player involved, declared herself regent of Austrasia, and by implication of the whole Frankish kingdom. The mayor of Neustria (Ragenfred) all but invented a king (who "reigned" under the name of Chilpéric II), attacked Austrasia from the south-west and defeated the armies of Plectrude near Compiègne with the help of Radbod the Frisian attacking from the north-west. So it seemed they had won (especially as the Lombards favored their side mostly, it seems, because they did not want a woman as their ruler). But Charles Martel, who was the illegitimate son of Pépin de Herstal (hence the enmity with Plectrude) managed to gain authority on the disgruntled Austrasians (also unhappy with their female ruler) and in turned defeated all the aforementioned actors. Except Plectrude, who was utterly defeated, they did not give up though. Ragenfred sought an alliance with the powerful duchy of Aquitaine (but was defeated again), Chilpéric II actually reigned again (as a compromise, it seems, between all the factions), Radbod and his successors kept menacing Austrasia and it is only with the victory against the Saracens that Charles Martel ultimately prevailed. Plectrude seemed to have been an exceptionally unpopular ruler (all the province of the kingdom of the Franks rebelled agains her rule, even her own), but it is hard to say whether this was mostly or entirely due to the fact that she was a woman (she is also a saint of the Catholic church). The mayors of Neustria are usually depicted as especially cruel and vicious in French historiography (the bad guys, so to speak) and there must be at least some truth to it considering how many died murdered by a lord they had wronged in some way. The fact that they were on the loosing side certainly played a role as well, of course. So I believe these were the tyrants. Any comparison of these events with Game of Thrones is, it seems to me, unjustified: despite dragons, the latter is much more believable. Sources: Charles Martel is a good starting point. I did not make the effort to check the English versions of the names of the key players, so my apologies if some names are a bit off.
