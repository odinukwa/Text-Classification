Well, part of the answer depends on how/why you've got GERD. If yours is like mine [A], you need to do things that do not compress the abdomen (road biking [B] and sit-ups) as well as keep ones' head raised above one's body (so no hanging upside down). None of the nearby gyms [C] have pools, so I can't test swimming. Notes: A - I shouldn't eat chocolate, alcohol or fatty foods, as those irritate the situation. B - With the ram's horns handlbars. Ones where I sit upright (such as hybrid, mountain or commuter bikes are fine). C - In the chain I'm a member of. 

Layering clothing is a smart idea if you live in cooler climates, or where the weather may change suddenly [A]. 

Riding to the university will be far more physical than taking the car, but the physical exertion will be dependent upon the speed you ride. A leisurely speed of 10 mph will not break a sweat, while a speed of 20mph will get your heart rate into the exercise zone and keep it there. As some examples, I can ride all day at 15 mph. At 18 mph, I can last about 5 miles. At 22 mph (the speed my co-workers prefer to pace themselves at), I can last about a half mile before I bonk. Tour-de-France riders average 30-35 mph over each day's stage. 

This seems like a fairly reasonable projection, but keep in mind that as you lose fat, each pound (or kilo) of fat is harder to lose than the one before it. This means that your cut phase may slow down as you get towards the end. I wouldn't fret about this, its typical. I would also like to refer you to this article about this exact topic which I found to be very helpful. $URL$ It goes into detail about how long and much you should bulk and cut, depending on a couple common goals. Hope it helps! 

To expand on the first answer, it depends. Cardio has two main uses: 1) It increases the amount of work you can do in a given workout session. As you get further into a workout, the aerobic system provides more and more of the energy used to lift the weights. Stronger aerobic system = more reps/sets completed. 2) It increases the calories your body needs for that day, and increases your metabolism for a number of hours afterwards (provided the cardio lasts long enough and is intense enough). So, with these two in mind, I would say do more cardio if: -You want to be able to handle more volume in your weight workouts, and/or -You want your body to burn more calories Also, as a side note, biking 1 mile to the gym is basically negligible. 15 minutes of running is also not sufficient duration to be considered unless the intensity is very high. Consider at least 30 minutes of cardio for low intensity. If you want to do high-intensity cardio, you can spend less time, however it also usually involves higher risk of injury. 

You are a programmer like I am; that means that your most important feature is your brain. "Oversleeping" is not a problem. Overweight is a problem. Insufficient sleep is a problem. Sleeping is very important for keeping your brain working properly. Without your brain, you have no job. That 10-15 hour sleep on the weekends is your body's way of recovering what you've cheated it out of during the week. Sure, I'd love several extra hours per day, who wouldn't? You and I have the exact same 24 hours per day that every other human has. There is no other way around the fact that we're both meat bags and the bag of meat requires maintenance. Yes, we can be a lot more productive with 25+ hours per day, but reality doesn't allow that. My body prefers 9 hours of sleep per night: my lifestyle requires that I get 6 hours of sleep per night. Both things cannot be true - something has to give. For me, the weekends are for recovering what I can't get during the week. As you age, you will realize that your body is more important than your desired lifestyle. Get the sleep your body wants. 

First, just thought I'd mention that it says when joining this stack exchange that questions should not be opinion based. That said, I usually hang mine on a fold up clothes hanger, or over a railing outside. If these aren't options, you could just rinse them in the sink or toss them in a fresh bucket of water. 

Because of your goals, I would say a training plan is not necessary. For some people, say who struggle to run their first 5k, a plan is needed to build them up to that point. That isn't necessary for you however because you are already able to accomplish your goal which is running a few 5ks a week. The only real thought I would suggest putting into it is just keeping an eye out for any lingering joint pain. If that occurs, then change something (shoes, mileage per week, running form). 

If you are looking for ways to increase your speed at a given distance, I would suggest running over distance. We raced 5k, so we ran anywhere from 1.5x to 4x that distance. If that is a problem for you (because of injuries or whatnot), look into other forms of cardio that are lower impact. Cycling, swimming, rowing come to mind. Keep in mind the injury that you incurred on your longer run might not necessarily have been due to the extra distance. It could be anything from bad shoes to over training, to bad running form. 

If I do my reps slower, will it have a similar effect to increasing resistance? With respect to building muscles or improving max strength for example? Assume I go to failure / same level of fatigue in both cases. 7 DEC Example: In my current pull exercise, with the highest resistance, I can do 20 reps. I can continue to increase reps, but over time I want to increase resistance (with less reps). So I am thinking I could do it slower, with some of the same effects as high resistance. If it is "effective" is not really the question, more if it works similar to high resistance vs high rep. (Personal directions in profile) 

According to the Wikipedia DOMS article it is called "Repeated-bout effect" - or rather this is the "opposite" viewpoint - that there is less DOMS when you do something regularly. It also states that just one session is enough to reduce DOMS significantly in the following session - and the first session can be quite light. $URL$ 

Some people who do Yoga says morning stiffness is reduced after some years of practice. Also perhaps Yoga/stretching late in the evening. (The above relates to a general tendency of getting stiff during the night). 

I don't like short socks. My ex was a dancer and she hated long socks (she'd wear ankle length ones). Most of my socks don't quite go halfway up my shins, but I have some that make it to my knees, and those are hiking socks (and are for a small amount of padding in case things go up one's pants, or you're banging into things with your legs). For sports like footy/soccer/rugby, the length of socks is more like part of the uniform of the sport, like basketball shorts are for basketball. 

Yes, walking will help lose weight. As you get older, you may find yourself able to run less and less (before the onset of knee pain), so continuing walking will be helpful as exercise. I find that the difference between daily 30-45 min of walking (I have a desk job) and 0min walking is about 5-7 pounds (or maybe you'd rather prefer this explained as "if I walk 30-45 minutes per day, after about 2-3 months, my baseline weight is about 5-7 pounds lighter than when I have no time to walk at all"). When I was carless, I had to walk about 90-120 minutes daily as part of my commuting and was about 20 pounds lighter than when I later got a car and was able to drive everywhere. Your experience will probably be different.
