In Chapter 20 of the book Economic Dynamics in Discrete Time, named "Recursive Utility", the author asserts that the Time-Additive Expected Utility Model (TAEU) has some shortcomings when applied to dynamic economic models. He lists them as follows: 

My question is about the following notation: I have noticed in several places (for example here (page 15) and here (page 1)) that different authors use different notations for choice correspondences. Given a set $X$ of objects that might be chosen and a collection of non-empty subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of the power set of $X$, some use 

More precisely if $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell} : x \geq 0\}$, the production function would be $$ f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n}, \quad n\geq 2 $$ For simplicity we can assume the firm operates in a competitive market so that the price is given. My question is, how does the firm choose the input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}$ as to maximize profits? I did some research and apparently the type of problem this is a “multi-objective” optimization problem, and it appears to be an active field in engineering. Some of the methods to solve this kind of problems use pareto-dominance style arguments. I wanted to know if anyone could clarify the specific question of multi product profit maximization, and more generally I would also appreciate any literature or books on this topic (multi objective optimization), written for economists, as I have been searching in google and every book I find appears to be written for engineers. I suspect that a treatment of this topic from an economics point of view would involve some discussion of social choice theory. Any help is most welcomed! 

But debt is bonds, accounts payable refer to money owed to suppliers ($URL$ Is it under "Other Current Liabilities"?. How can I know? Anyone has experience looking at balance sheets? I'm learning this. 

Money has to be used in all transaction. So Q refers to all transactions. In the early literature Q refered to commodities. This includes everything, from inputs to outputs. So you should include not only GDP but also intermediate transactions. Using only GDP is like thinking that only final goods were bought using money! This is plainly wrong. 

The "common man" conception of money is not helpful to think about these issues. Money is not ONLY currency and notes anymore. These are just a TOKEN used to distribute goods and provide exchanges. They are not the real stuff. For example, when you make a bank account transfer, you are not moving TOKENS. Why would you? Banks are given these tokens by the central bank in order to keep a smooth movement of payments. So Apple does not have 80% of all tokens of the US economy in a vault somewhere. Why would they? It's dangerous! They have such ownership of wealth, but in the form of a current account and other assets. So you need to think differently between a claim on wealth, WHICH CAN BE TURNED INTO TOKENS, and the TOKENS THEMSELVES. 

Then he introduces Recursive Utility (RU) as a class of preferences developed to overcome these issues. He then proceeds to study the properties of RU, without stopping to study these "shortcomings". I am interested in the following: even though I could try to derive the anomalies myself, is there a article/textbook/survey article that studies formally (by formally I mean in a decision theoretic fashion, i.e studying the axioms and their effect on the representation) the structure of TAEU and show formally the shortcomings mentioned above? The author offers references for textbook and survey treatments of RU, but not the TAEU. Thank you very much for any comment and help! 

The result of consumption smoothing seems to be independent of the preference for such smoothing: one needs the condition $\beta =(1+r)$ to hold in orther to obtain the result. It seems to me that the implication $$ u^{\prime}(c_t)=u^{\prime}(c_{t+1}) \quad \Rightarrow c_t=c_{t+1} $$ 

They both want to express that the co-domain of the choice correspondence must include all the non-empty subsets of the power set of X, i.e from any menu of options, you must choose something. My question is, which one is the correct way to define it? Clearly, since $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$, both definitions cannot be equivalent. My intuition would tell me that from the list above, (1) is the correct one. For example, if $X=\{\text{pasta (p)}, \text{chicken (c)}, \text{sushi (s)}\}$, then the power set of $X$ is: $$ 2^{X}=\Bigg\{\emptyset, \{p \}, \ \{c \}, \{s \}, \{p,c \}, \{p,s \} , \{c,s \}, \{ p,c, s\} \Bigg\} $$ Since I want to “take out” the empty set from $2^{X}$ so that the choice from any non-empty subset of $X$ is itself non-empty, and since $\{\emptyset\} \notin 2^{X}$, it should be $$ c:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow 2^{X}\backslash \emptyset $$ Thank you for any answers!

Your idea was proposed more than 100 years ago by Silvio Gesell ($URL$ He wanted to create a National Currency Office, in charge of money. No private banks. Money would be created in accordance with amount of wealth available. It would also depreciate, to make people spend it. Read his book "Natural Economic Order". It is online. You might be interested also in Social Credit ($URL$ I am reading about this at the moment. Very interesting. 

Risk is important. A bond (or even a credit) is backed up by the company's assets. Companies go bankrupt because of a mismatch between assets and liabilities maturities (e.g. cannot pay a bond of a loan), but not because they are unsustainable in the long run. If a company goes bankrupt, debtholders are the first on the list (after workers, in some countries) to receive compensation. Sometimes they do assume losses, when the debt is negotiated at a lower value. The shareholder is the last one to get any money out of the assets of the company. So being a shareholder is more risky than being a bondholder. 

A classic on public choice and taxation theory is "The Power to Tax: Analytic Foundations of Fiscal Constitution" by Brennan and Buchanan Really interesting book and relatively easy read.

I think that this article might be helpful: “Exotic Preferences for Macroeconomists” $URL$ They give a thorough explanation of many preference functionals and show their usefulness with macroeconomic applications. Im not a specialist in macroeconomics, so I dont know the literature that well, but I think that the most used preferences nowadays are the Epstein-Zin preferences. The article I cite discusses thoroughly their properties. A nice thing this paper has is that it contains detailed comments from Peter Lars Hansen and Ivan Werning among others at the back. Hope it helps! 

The typical dynamic consumption-saving under certainty model can be written as: $$ \max V(c)=\sum_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{t-1}\; u(c_t) $$ Subject to the intertemporal budget constraint $$ \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{y_t}{1+r}=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{c_t}{1+r} $$ Where $T\leq \infty$ (finite or infinite horizon), $\beta \in (0,1)$ is the subjective discount factor, $y_t$ is the individual's income and $c_t$ is the individual's consumption in every time period. Finally, $u(\cdot)$ is the agent's subutility function, with $u^{\prime}>0$ whose concavity is usually related to the agent's preference for consumption smoothing. The argument is equivalent to the one justifying that an individual will reveal risk aversion iff his utility function over wealth is strictly concave. The argument that leads to consumption smoothing is the following: The first order condition for the problem is the well known Euler equation $$ \frac{u^{\prime}(c_t)}{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}=\beta \; (1+r) $$ It is assumed that $\beta^{-1}=(1+r)$ so that $$ u^{\prime}(c_t)=u^{\prime}(c_{t+1}) \quad \Rightarrow \text{by strict concavity of} \; u \quad c_t=c_{t+1} $$ I have two questions regarding this argument which are somehow related: 

I think this is because of liquidity. If I am a poor household, and I own stocks (maybe via my pension?), if the price of those stocks go up, I cannot consume such extra income. Actually, if the stock market crashes, my capital gains can be wiped out! So in a sense, this is not "actual purchasing power", as it is the case with direct income like wages or transfers. So, to the day to day interest of a household, capital gains should not be relevant for their wellbeing. 

I am looking at the balance sheet of Coca-Cola ($URL$ but I cannot guess where loans with banks are. These liabilities accounts are: 

No, because money can be destroyed and counterfeited. For example, I have a shop, and you buy something from me. I could burn the money. The number of goods have not changed, but money has. Similarly, evildoers can counterfait money, adding it to circulation, without changing the amount of goods available in the economy. 

I have a question. A company is worth 1 million dollars, in terms of present value of revenues, discounted at rate R. Can I borrow 1 million dollars from a bank and buy the company? If the bank charges me R, I am indifferent? Or, can I issue a bond for 1 million, with coupon R? Am I indifferent too? Do these things happen? Do businesses ask for credit or issue bonds in order to buy companies? 

Constant marginal rate of substitution between consecutive periods. One of the consequences of this is that a consumer that faces a given interest rate, would either save with no limit, or borrow without limit (except when the subjective discount factor equals the interest rate). TAEU implies that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is equal to the inverse of the relative risk aversion coefficient. TAEU implies indifference to the timing of the resolution of uncertainty. TAEU cannot explain experimental anomalies such as the Ellsberg Paradox, etc. 

Your question seems a bit broad. What kind of “theoretical economics” are your reading? Nevertheless, I infer from what you write that you need to start from the beginning with maths for economcis (and maths in general), (this is because of your comment not knowing when to use an exponent and when to multiply. Having said this, I would recommend: “Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis” by Hammond et al This book starts at the basics and builds up mathematical tools to study economic ideas. Having mastered this book, I would try “The Structure of Economics” of Eugene Silberberg. This books is more advanced, but it is “economics with mathematics”, so having aquired the basic mathematical tools in the first book, this book focuses con economic models from a mathematical standpoint. 

The theory of present value states that the price of a stock is the discounted value of the infinite stream of future income of the company. Several countries have had very very low interest rates, very close to zero. Yet, stock prices have not gone to very very high values, or even infinity. Why is this the case? Is this a proof that the theory of present value is incorrect? Or maybe investors think companies will not last "forever" (which they cannot, as earth's lifespawn is finite)? 

Thank you Brian for the suggestion, and the others too. It took me a long time to find it in the Coca-Cola report, and it was under Current Liabilities: 

As I understood from my lectures, a multiplicative function means that the marginal product of one factor increases when another factor increases, and decreases when another factor decreases. The extreme cases (leontieff or additive) don't have this property. At the moment the teacher explained this, it made sense to me. If one factor increases, it expands the capacity of the other to produce more. I think it makes sense.
