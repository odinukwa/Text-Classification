The person is an idiot who just made a nonsensical statement. The person is a propagandist who wants other people to think the activist is doing bad things, rather than good things. 

Misanthropy could simply be an expression of frustration - or a perception of reality. Most people in our culture are taught to respect authority. We're taught that man was created in God's image, blah, blah, blah. When a person suddenly discovers that authority can be extraordinarily corrupt, that people have a dark side, humans have been trashing the very planet we live on for thousands of years, and maybe there is no God, then it's only natural to see people in a new light. In this spirit, we might ask if misanthropy is necessarily bad or "evil." With that in mind, we might visualize three categories of books: 

Great question! I think the short answer is YES, with a few caveats. First, some religions are more compatible with science than others. For example, people who adhere to certain "Eastern religions" don't have as big a problem with evolution as do many Christians. Second, what do you mean by "compatible"? If you're talking about putting religion under a microscope to see if it's scientifically valid, then good luck. However, as someone else noted, many scientists appear to have the same attitude towards religion they have towards politics - they're blind sheep, just like non-scientists. Religion and science can therefore be "compatible" in the sense that even a reputable scientist can profess to believe in some religion that he or she has never really put under a microscope. For many, religion can be thought of as cultural baggage or a social trapping. I grew up in a religious (Christian) household myself, and it was my interest in science and sense of logic that prompted me to abandon ship at an early age. For me, science and the big three religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) are incompatible, though I have interest in Eastern religion. 

If we forget about philosophy for a second, humans clearly began to dominate their environment when they learned how to make tools and weapons and harnessed fire. Insects are largely oblivious to humans, just as they're oblivious to other creatures that are 10,000 times their size. However, larger vertebrates learned to fear humans long ago. In the philosophical realm, some religions (e.g. Christianity) teach that humans are superior to animals and should exploit them. I'm not sure what you mean by animals sensing that they "dominate" other species. Predators are certainly aware of which prey species they're capable of catching and killing. Elephants at a waterhole are clearly aware that they can push smaller animals aside. Some insects "enslave" other insect species. So your question, as it's written, doesn't make a lot of sense. That humans "dominate" animals is a simple fact. If you're asking about the acceptability of exploiting or harming animals, that's another matter. Different philosophers and philosophies have different views. 

Awesome question! I was just commenting on evidence in a post focusing on conspiracy theory. As others have suggested, different philosophers have different ideas about what constitutes "evidence," "truth," etc. I up voted Guill's answer because it emphasizes the fact that there are different amounts/types of evidence. However, he listed some amounts, but not types, so I'd like to elaborate on the latter. There's direct evidence, which may include "smoking gun evidence" (best of all, a signed confession). There's circumstantial evidence -- evidence that tends to prove a fact by proving other events or circumstances which afford a basis for a reasonable inference of the occurrence of the fact at issue In politics and conspiracy science, we may focus on historical patterns and connecting the dots. For example, if you know that conquest, intimidation, conspiracy and exploitation were attributes of the Greek empire, the Roman empire, the Spanish empire and so forth, you might suspect that these are attributes of ALL empires, including the current U.S. government. And if you know that Bill Gates' wife and pal (Warren Buffet) both sat on the Washington Post's board of directors, you might "connect the dots" (a form of inference) and suspect that Gates is using his power to influence the media. Another type of inference is used in studying evolution. Having already established the fact that organisms evolve, scientists can assume that modern whales must have evolved from some other organism. And if they haven't yet found fossils of whales' direct ancestor, they commonly refer to it as a gap in the fossil record (or "missing link"). Yet another form of evidence is reality. If the media tell you the government's doing a great job, the economy's improving, blah, blah, blah, but your salary is stagnant, your benefits are doing downhill, and you see more homeless people on the streets every week, you might be a little suspicious. Then there's "God." Some people say everything we see is evidence of his (or her) existence, while others say there is no evidence for God whatsoever. In summary, instead of asking WHAT determines lack of evidence, we might ask WHO determines lack of evidence. There's a lot of cherry-picking involved. Consider judges' often mind boggling ability to dictate what's admissible as evidence and what isn't. Your second question is more complex. What do you mean by "no evidence" - no DIRECT evidence, or no evidence altogether? And what do you mean by "believe"? Are you talking about a rock solid belief, or do you include suspicions or theories? With a background in science, I'm personally inclined to not believe in anything for which there is no evidence. However, that evidence can be indirect or even theoretical. If I'm not mistaken, Carl Sagan believed in the existence of intelligent species on distant worlds, though there's still no real evidence of their existence. On the other hand, we might argue that Earth itself is evidence. If life can evolve on a planet in our solar system, why can't it evolve on planets throughout the universe? What's really interesting is Sagan's rationale explaining his theory that "space aliens" have never visited Earth. How do you explain the actions of beings that may not even exist? Yet Sagan used some elegantly simple logic to form an explanation that further tells us that UFO's are not associated with space aliens. P.S. Another thing I forgot to mention is familiarity with evidence. I recently read a story about Stephen Gould (of evolutionary science fame) visiting a dig in Kenya (Olduvai, I think). The Leakey family was renowned for their ability to spot the fossilized jaw of a mouse at a distance, something Gould couldn't do. Yet Gould, who did a lot of work with snails, was the first to spot a fossil snail at the site. So when someone says "That isn't evidence," it's possible they can't recognize the evidence because they don't have the proper training or experience, or they could be a propagandist who denies the evidence that's in plain view. 

It sounds like you mean better for the ruler rather than better for the people. But how do you define "better"? Are you simply asking which ruler has the better chance of staying in power, one who is loved vs one who is feared? And did you really mean to say "loved or feared" or "loved and hated"? A ruler can be loved and feared at the same time. Finally, loved or feared by whom? The majority of a ruler's subjects, or a minority that may hold even more power? What about foreign leaders? In modern history, a number of countries have embraced socialism as an alternative to capitalism, which is commonly seen as a parasite on poor, developing countries. Salvador Allende was the first socialist elected president of a Latin American country. He obviously had popular support in his country, but he was hated by the West and soon wound up dead. He was replaced by a military junta led by Augusto Pinochet, who was a widely feared and hated tyrant. Yet Pinochet spent seventeen years in office and was never prosecuted for a wide variety of heinous crimes. Salvador Allende's fate was shared by Patrice Lumumba, a socialist who became the first prime minister of the Republic of the Congo. Under Muammar Gaddafi, Libya boasted the highest standard of living in Africa, but Gaddafi was reviled by the West, which eventually invaded and destroyed the country, murdering Gaddafi in the process. George W. Bush was one of the most feared and hated presidents in American history. But he was beloved by the plutocrats he represented and served two terms in office. In contrast, Obama was greeted as a conquering hero, largely because he was a Democrat who replaced a widely reviled Republican president. Yet Obama's policies were a virtual carbon copy of Bush's policies. Still, Obama served two terms, similar to Bush. Obama was loved by many citizens, including the very people his administration sold out. So here we have two frighteningly corrupt and destructive presidents, one widely feared and hated by the people, while Obama enjoyed widespread support (though he was still feared and hated abroad), both of which were allowed two terms. On the other hand, a corrupt leader who wants all the power might court the people rather than the plutocrats. Julius Caesar and Caligula were among the emperors who sought to downsize the Senate, at the same time appeasing the masses with entertainment or propaganda. Towards the end of the Roman empire, authoritarian emperors found themselves at the mercy of the feared Praetorian Guard, who assassinated emperors with increasing frequency. So if a Roman emperor wanted to survive, who did he want to be loved by, the people or his bodyguard? Politics can be awfully similar to a juggling act. In summary, political leaders often have to walk a tightrope, appeasing 1) the majority, 2) a powerful minority and 3) other countries. They may even have to deal with more specific entities, like the Praetorian Guard or J. Edgar Hoover. If a modern leader wants to help the poor, boost literacy or protect the environment, he or she needs a powerful bulwark against the almost inevitable attacks that will come from the U.S. 

1) In a similar vein to squatting, you could try living off the land. Move to the Amazon or some remote tropical island and become a modern day Robinson Crusoe. Of course, that's very, very hard to do, and you're going to need money to get set up. 2) Work as a wage slave and reconcile your moral objection with the knowledge that you simply have no choice (just as starving people are sometimes forced to resort to cannibalism). I use fossil fuels every time I jump on a bus, and it bothers me, but I just shrug and accept it as the only alternative. 3) Work as a wage slave, then use some of your free time to plot reform or revenge. I've taken on some corrupt supervisors, officials and unions and publicly criticized my employer. It can be dangerous, but it can also be very satisfying - and even little exciting. In plain English, discover a cause bigger than yourself and become an activist. Alan Watts! I remember that guy from my college days. He was so cool. But telling people that they can make money by following their passion is cruelly deceptive. Sure, it's possible. But Google the term "starving artist." 

Imagine a political activist who says something that's true but not politically correct. The government responds by passing a law making it illegal to say what he said. Instead of criticizing the government, some people tell the activist, "Thanks a lot. If you had kept your mouth shut, we wouldn't have lost more of our rights." To put it another way, they're saying that we have the right to do certain things...as long as we don't actually do them. What kind of fallacy is this, if any?
