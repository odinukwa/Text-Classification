Flowing ions is the realm of electrical fields, and there have been experiments using electricity to disrupt the surface tension of water. "Surface tension of electrified water decreases as the positive or negative charge increases, but its density and viscosity are the same as those of neutral water." In the articles I found, the goal seemed to be to use electricity to make water itself more soluble. This is the opposite effect to what you want, so I propose a handwavy planet with a "strange" electrical field that resonates with the hydrogen bond in water, perhaps very subtly, just enough so that the water surface generates it's own coherent electrical field. This "plasma water" is only a few molecules deep, enough to change the surface tension but it is still regular water. Because we've given the surface of the water an electrical field, it will display electromagnetic behaviors like magnetic braking and motion damping when it encounters any ion field – the same damping effect that we see when a magnet is dropped through a copper pipe. 

Unfortunately, there are no "dervish" planets that spin with a pole pointing at the Sun. We have some planets that tipped over, but their pole does not turn to keep pointing at the sun. It would have a "north star" that it points to, same as we do. 

The planet might be at almost any axial tilt, and it's moons presumably follow that tilt. That means the sun does not necessarily get eclipsed by the planet every "day". A series of eclipses might happen only seasonally in the fall and spring at the equinox. Your moon would experience summer and winter depending on that axial tilt, with the odd caveat that you might have uninterrupted "days" of sunshine in the winter and summer. 

Only select women… and sperm. Women work better together and will be far less violent. Sperm can be frozen and transported easily. Men would consume resources without providing a useful womb (assuming there are no artificial wombs). The women can easily be trained to fill all science and technical positions. You can't afford to have any dead weight. With frozen sperm you can also bypass all inbreeding issues for generations to come, maybe indefinitely. They can easily select for sex while they screen for genetic problems. All pregnancies will be artificially inseminated anyway. The oldest verified mother was nearly 67, so there is no reason to worry about age. Science and hormones may be able to extend that even more. You certainly wouldn't allow a couple to have TWO children with the same zygote parents, and you wouldn't leave such decisions up to random Friday night dates and mood lighting. If your entire population is women, they could pair off into couples (or triples) to co-parent. Some women might actually enjoy pregnancy while others would delay or abstain, but with an all female crew you've doubled your capabilities for pregnancies. If you also bring frozen eggs, the scientists and engineers are not necessarily reusing their own DNA. The 1st generation could have maximum diversity with every individual being no genetic relation to any other – although you would still screen for genetic disorders so I'm not sure how useful this would be (maybe very useful if you suspect future generations will not have the same invitro technology). They should not create any male births until the crisis has safely passed (when they reach a new planet, or however your ark works). Men carry less genetic information – most people are surprised by how much less – and the whole point of a breeding program is to be able to safely select for recessive genes. Y chromosomes would compromise that. 

Stem cells in embryos do not suffer from telomere depletion. Neither do most cancer cells, therefore they can go on replicating (theoretically) forever. Telomeres are an intense focus of research, so it's very likely there will be several life-extending discoveries in the near future. My suggestion is that after a series of scientific discoveries in cancer research where we learn how this process works, a food source like rice or grain will be genetically modified to extend the life of telomeres. That food source will be patented at first, but eventually the patents expire and the GMO grain becomes widely available. Since this "cure" extends only the amount of telomeres you have left (it does not replace what you've already lost) people who have eaten the GMO grain from childhood experience drastically longer lives than people who began eating the grain as adults. 

I suggest a two-stage system to get your cargo to the moon. Some brief research suggests every lunar mission has involved a second "launch" from Earth's orbit. Stage One can be your space gun or maglev rail designed to put standard payloads into orbit: $URL$ Stage Two offers choices at different price ranges and delivery times, from a rocket that would take 2-3 days, to an ion thruster that would take over a year. $URL$ Non-parishable supplies could be scheduled and shipped cheaply a year in advance, but the colony would never be more than a few days away from an emergency delivery. 

In layman's terms, it's where two or more magnetic fields push together and start sharing and rearranging their ion loops. What was once a magnetic "barrier" layer between them is suddenly gone, like a rubberband snaps and the whole system has to rebalance. ESA has a page on reconnection in the Earth's magnetic field (with an alarming 20sec animation that might give you ideas). NASA also has a good page with video. Your disaster might go something like: 

People actually might not feel as bad about being left behind if they believed they would live on in some way, by contributing to a future human colony. I would hard sell the sperm/egg bank idea upfront to your general population, and tell everyone they are accepted. It would be up to future generations to decide if and when to use the bank anyway (and they might actually use it for gene splicing spare parts). 

Bioengineer a food source that extends the life of telomeres. Telomeres are at the ends of our DNA strands. They don't seem to contribute to our genetics. They are a repeating sequence of DNA at the ends of the chromosomes, like a start/stop signal for protein building. The way our chromosomes divide and replicate, they don't copy the full telomere and some of that repeated signal is left off the next generation of chromosomes. This means your chromosomes can only replicate about 40-60 times until there is not enough telomere left to begin the replication process, called the Hayflick Limit. The way our DNA replicates itself can be compared (roughly) to the zipper on a jacket. When the jacket is zipped closed, there are two sides of the zipper locked together. In the process of chromosome replication, the zipper pull slides down the length of the zipper unlocking the two sides and attaching a new matching strand for each side, but a little piece of the telomere ends are not replicated. The analogy is like a zipper that has lost it's end tab, preventing you from threading the zipper pull. 

A long forgotten race of Ancients built a network of Stargates. They eventually evolved to a higher plane, but left behind many of their working portals to other planets. Subsequent species discovered the network, some of whom trafficked in less-developed species as slave labor. Over the centuries the political landscape shifted and the parasitic species abandoned the planet leaving the primitive worker species to fend on their own. Eventually the primitive species discover the Stargate and conquer the galaxy with gumption, the spirit of friendship, and a series of unlikely scenarios where far more advanced societies are easily befuddled by aliens with only medieval technology and a simplistic understanding of science. 

If they live on the sunward side, they'd lie around all day napping and collecting warmth from the meager sun. On the night side they'd run back and forth playing with their toys as loudly as possible, keeping everyone awake. 

Because the species no longer lays eggs in the ground, inconsistent incubation temperature is no longer an issue and so most children are female. 

One problem: satellites are mostly aluminum and not magnetic. The main factor when launching materials into space is weight, not strength, so there isn't much steel involved. Near-future space materials will likely be even less magnetic: carbon fiber, honeycomb Kevlar, nano-tubes, graphene, aerogels and microlattice. Circuits might be printed on glass and use photonic processors. After a quick search around the web, it looks like ESA and the other space agencies are looking at nets and tethers that drag the debris down to the atmosphere, one-by-one. I like your Space Roomba device better, like an orbital vacuum cleaner. Maybe it could have a variety of "weapons" to attack clutter: lasers, sticky thread (like a chameleon tongue), one company is testing a static electricity Swiffer™. Maybe it could shoot plastic pellets to knock debris down to burn in the atmosphere (not sure how pellets wouldn't make more space debris). The problem with flinging debris away from the Earth is it would need escape velocity or you aren't doing anyone any favors. Easier to knock debris down the gravity well. 

Unusual sun activity leads to a magnetic "storm": a series of reconnection ripples. The Earth's magnetopause is compromised as they hit faster than the magnetopause can recover. Extra fireworks caused by solar plasma far deeper into the Earth's atmosphere and the turbulence from the reconnections themselves bring the magnetic storm to our front door. "Aftershocks" as the system balances, ripple and dissipate through the magnetosphere, but also cause compression waves that can channel plasma in unpredictable ways. 

It's not volume or surface area that defines the population, but the purpose of the arco, and politics of the society who built it. You mention an "alternate history scenario" but you don't offer any hint how it is different from today. In reality humans are not like logs that can be stacked into a defined volume. Humans will adapt to overcrowding, and "personal space" is based on income and real estate values. You asked for reality check. You should decide WHY the arco was built (presumably to accommodate a denser population than "an apartment building adjacent to a dam". Zone your arco's industrial areas and subtract them from the volume. The space left over is available for residents and public areas. Depending on where in the world your dam is, it will have different legal definitions of Overcrowding. If your goal is maximum number of dwellers start with existing overcrowding/zoning regulations and make it more dense. Kowloon City for example was unregulated but obv not designed as an efficient arco. Cruise ships can be very dense and still comfortable, but they are almost the opposite spectrum of a self-sustainable arcology. Also look at Chungking Mansions and Mirador Mansions budget hotels in HK for examples of very small private living quarters. After that you have SRO hotels with shared bathrooms, and then hostels and dormitories. Your arco might have any mix of these with the ability to reconfigure as housing needs fluctuate. Without some idea of what you consider suitable space for your population there isn't a hard answer. Social and legal pressures would decide the limits, not architects. 

New York is 33ft above sea level. London is about 135ft, and Athens highest point is over 1100ft but generally around 235ft above sea level. So presumably we are talking very different time frames for each city, but to directly answer your question: No, possibly never. Sea levels rise and drop because of global sea temperature and the amount of polar ice that locks the planet's water above sea level. Earth has gone through cycles of heating and cooling, which has caused the polar ice caps and glaciers to grow and shrink. The last interglacial period when Earth was only a little warmer than it is now, 125,000 years ago, and sea level was estimated to be about 12 to 20ft higher probably due to the melting of Greenland and the West Antarctic ice caps. New York would have considerably less land, but London and Athens would not be under water. In contrast, during the last glacial maximum about 19,000 years ago, sea levels dropped by over 400ft exposing the continental shelf and creating land bridges that connected continents. If you want the movement of the Earth's crust to actually sink the cities below sea level, there are several factors to consider. The Earth's crust is technically floating on the mantle, so land can be driven upwards or sink downwards depending on what is happening to neighboring areas under the crust. We all understand that mountains are uplifted when two tectonic plates push together, but the weight of glaciers and the polar ice caps is also considerable. The heavy ice pushes down on the crust beneath it, and part of the mantle "squishes out" to nearby areas to lift the land up. As the ice melts the mantle flows back under the glacier and the surrounding lands sink – called "glacial rebound". The oceans are also estimated to weigh considerably and push down on the sea floor, rising continents higher. All of this makes estimating the "true" sea level at various points in Earth's timeline very difficult. Another factor is the ice caps don't simply melt and the global sea level rises evenly all at once. Water is trapped behind ice walls for thousands of years like North America's Lake Agassiz. Eventually the ice wall melts causing outburst floods, but even these can take hundreds of years to drain into the oceans. The Zanclean flood which filled the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean over 5 million years ago might have happened quickly or slowly, we really don't know. Some scientists postulate the Mediterranean filled at 30ft a day with a dramatic 1 kilometer waterfall, but others believe it was gradual around 10,000 years. Continents are also sliding around, and the next Pangea-like super continent is estimated at 250 million years from now. Where today's cities end up, along an ocean coast or not, is really only a guess. So it makes for a dramatic mythology, but entire civilizations sinking beneath the sea is not a world-wide event. If you want a reason for a specific coastal city to sink, it is possible with local volcanic activity, and has happened many times within written history, for example: the Roman city of Baiae.
