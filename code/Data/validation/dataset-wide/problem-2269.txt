First of all you need to control what is life threatening. Control the bleed. Lay them down and elevate the wound if necessary. Apply sterile dressings (or the closest thing you have to sterile). As it continues to bleed apply more dressings. Blood goes through a clotting process and if you pull the dressings it has to start over. Then assess the situation. Get them comfortable and warm. Give them something to drink. Ask them how they feel and if they are on medication. Clean the wound is secondary at this time. Make a long term plan. If are going to extricate and get them to a hospital in a few hours then only clean and dress if you have the materials to do it right. If it is going to be longer than 24 hours to get professional medical care then clean the best you can. If you used everything you have sterile then boil some clothes. Even if you don't have an antiseptic you have soap. You will find products call first aid antiseptic. Good old soap is better than whiskey. It not realistic to carry the volume of peroxide required to irrigate a wound in the back country. If you have a wound like that then you need to make plans to get them to a medical facility. You don't have a big rush. You are not going to have a serious infection in 48 hours. Just a cut cooking is not likely to be life threatening. Control the bleed with a dressing. Clean with soap and water. Then some antiseptic if you have it. I don't see using whiskey unless you don't even have soap. Let it dry and apply the best dressing you have. If you are out of sterile dressing then boil some clothes and hang them out to dry. An up to date first aid kit can mean a lot of stuff. Build your own and take a first aid class. American Red Cross has a wilderness first aid. Ony in the back country would you be in a situation of longer term care. No off the shelf first aid kit is going have the volume to control a major bleed and that is what is going to kill some one. 

Assuming that you have the right kind of a backpack according to your requirements. First, you need to separate things that you need frequently and things you'll need less often. The way I camp/trek and plan things, I am okay to pack everything all over again in the morning. Generally, it is best suited to pack lighter items in the bottom of the pack and heavier stuff toward the top, the idea is to keep heavier stuff closer to your back and not on bum. This keeps your center of gravity relatively high. Center of gravity plays a very important role in balancing your body when in motion. Higher Center of gravity tends to make it easy to haul the backpack easily while your performance with balance is hampered. Women naturally have a lower center of gravity, so the women I know and trek with, they pack heavier stuff at the bottom, that further increases their stability. Remember, The lower your center of gravity is , the easier it is to keep yourself balanced, pack feels heavier. The higher your center of gravity is, the easier it is to haul the pack but chances are more to dwell/tip off or go off-balance. 

Yes, for Har-ki-doon trek you need a local forest permit. Hiring a guide is not a mandatory thing, but recommended. The guide will take care of campsites and arranging food at a fair bargain. First things first. 

Its a bit hard to give a proper answer as you are at the beginning so the reasons it happens might be a few different ones Since from other information in the comments you say that this happened during the pool sessions of your course and you are not certified yet, I don't think is ok giving you too many tips about what to do, or suggest you to use one technique instead of the other. Its your instructor the one that has the responsibility for you and (for the moment) you should follow their methods and refer to them for resolving those things. Other suggestions might conflict with what/how they are teaching and that would be annoying for them and for sure not good for you. Masks problems are very annoying and frustrating, the instructors are there to help and will take the time to solve it for you, don't be afraid of asking them. The important thing is that if the problem persists when the open water part of the course comes, you don't freak out, you will be fine. Ask your instructor if they can keep an eye on you and if they can stay right beside following you during the descent and correct you if necessary. (Don't feel weird about it, that's the reason you are required to take a course to get certified and they are there to fix these things). That said: from the comments you said you tried only the Valsalva. As it might be related to the way you perform the maneuver rather than the breathing in itself, be aware that there are other equalization techniques and you might prefer one of those. Given your situation I wont list them, they are described in scuba articles all over the net and you can discuss them with your instructors (don't use them without having talked with your instructors first). However don't be lazy and change technique just because one doesn't come out right, its a good thing to try to perfect all of them, even if one works better than the other now things might change in the future, and your instructor might want you to stick with the Valsalva. You should also have learned to equalize the mask so, in itself, breathing through the nose into the mask shouldn't be a disaster like you describe. Strap and pressure should keep it in place. This brings to the mask fitting: You said in the comments that you had the two masks you tried fitted at a "reputable shop". Be aware that its not if the shop is reputable or not, the fact is that fitting dry just goes so far. Some masks simply don't fit well some faces (although a leak is different than a mask just leaving your face). Even the strap should be properly regulated and positioned. Like many divers I went through quite a few masks before finding the perfect one, they might feel and look all similar but a small detail can make a big difference. I would suggest trying all the different models you can, and I mean different shapes, amount of coverage of the face, with and without purge valve, different volumes etc. (Lower profile masks have less volume, some like them some don't). Your dive shop could have some demos, tell your instructors you want to try all you can beforehand so they can bring the demos at the open water sessions (this means buying the good one from that diveshop too if they go to all the trouble to help you, some are very expensive but don't go look for the best price online). 

Firstly, warm up neatly, and Try to move through the overhang. Visualize the moves and flow through them. If you stop it's hard to get moving again. Use your whole body. It's easy to get good hands and try and pull yourself up. If you observe good climbers on overhanging problems or routes you will likely notice that they continually twist and turn, keeping their hips close by twisting one knee inwards, so don't forget about your feet. Get them high and pull/push your way over, since our legs are stronger than our fingers and arms so if we can keep our hip from hanging out too far then our body weight is distributed towards our feet as much as possible. To keep your hips close on steep ground you will find that twisting them helps in a way that you can reach much further using less power than you could if you maintained a square on position. Keep your foot stance close to your body. If you move your upper body and arms, make sure you moving your feet close to your torso or your feet will fall off the rock and you will be doing a lot hanging on your hands. So, you should keep as much weight on your feet as possible instead of trying to just do a pull up. Drop-knees can do a lot for taking the weight off your arms for a moment, as can bridging your feet as wide as possible. Whatever position you get into when you take a quick rest try to hang with a straight arm, as this will use less energy and help you recover faster. Always be aware of your center of gravity and keep your hips close to the wall. Being aware of your body position and focusing on making smooth transitions from one position to the next will perhaps aid your improvement more than anything. Last but not the least: Visualize the moves and flow through them. If you stop it's hard to get moving again. And You may want to learn how to do a heel hook. 

Trailers can be literally thrown around by a tornado, even high straight winds can be a concern, under it is not a safe place. Usually the idea is to know when they come and move out well before they hit: you, family, pets... these are the important things, the rest is replaceable so don't waste time in trying to save objects. Keeping a bag ready with whats necessary for you+pets in an emergency (a "bug out bag") so that you can just "grab and go" can be a good idea. That bag would also be the place where you would normally store things like personal documents and important medications, so even if you use something everyday you know its either in your hand or in there. Many RV guys consider a weather radio an essential item (in addition to that there are all the various websites and mobile apps that can help in keeping an eye on weather conditions at all times, and I'm talking about things in-depth like NOAA). In risky areas where travel trailers are common there might be some sort of community shelters (or buildings that offer shelter to the community, heard of schools doing that for example), also look for any nearby suitable buildings where find refuge in the area (like parking garages) etc. The responsible for any organized area for trailers should be able to give you the right informations on what are your options, otherwise you could try asking the local police or fire dept. Camping I heard plenty of people that say to keep an eye on the landscape that surrounds you, to use a ditch or similar. Id say that it cant hurt to be aware of the possibility but consider it a last resort thing. 

Open is a common term in sports tournaments. It is a class that is open to anyone that wants to sign up. Typically even pros can enter an open division but some tournaments may exclude pros from Open. For a club type event it also means you don't have to be member of the club (or country). British Open, US Open, .... 

Yes most of what you eat consumes water for digestion - nuts, grain, beans, and meat. Most if not all vegetables. Only limited fruits have excess water over digestion. Can only hope you have enough water to consume a healthy diet. This game condition in which you only get water from food is not realistic. 

Should work fine if he is set up for smaller fish. Even a set up for large fish would work but you would need to put a light line on it. Saltwater reel is designed to withstand the corrosive effects of salt. It works fine in fresh water. As for bait and lure it will depend on the fish. A local tackle shop can help you out. Your uncle knows his gear. Ask him if he thinks it will work. 

I think you are better off describing the conditions. Like choppy and or gusty. The boat could heel / lean, rock, or even capsize. It is more the captain and crew that are floundering. Past flounder is distress. Crew and or boat need help. 

You need to know if you are in Northern Hemisphere or in Southern Hemisphere or nearby the Equator. If you are in Northern Hemisphere: First locate the Polaris. Its the last star in The Ursa Minor. I've had trouble in locating it sometimes. Many people do. So, if you are in such a situation, try locating The Ursa Major. The Ursa Major is located just to the north of The Celestial Pole. Depending upon the time of the year constellation of stars may be tipped in different directions as it rotates around the Polaris, so you could use the two stars that form the outer edge of the Ursa Major. Join the two starts from the Ursa Major to the one last star in Ursa Minor. The star that you have pointed to is Polaris. Draw an imaginary straight line from Polaris to the ground, thats the North! More popularly, the Ursa Minor is also known as The Little Dipper and the Ursa Major is known as The Big Dipper. 

I was just going through the details about processes and dependencies, and associated tough-nuts with planning and executing a trek to Everest Base Camp from Nepal side. In the same context, I had previously asked a question about travelling and itinerary to reach Namache Bazzaar. Whilst, I have most of the necessary information about the route and day-viz plan along with the accommodation en-route, I was recently informed by a fellow (who spends a quite a lot of time in and around Himalayas) that with the kind of a season I am looking forward to, I'm most likely gonna find the trek pretty much crowded. As per my current plan, I can somehow put extra efforts and make a way-back trip to EBC instead of staying there, but I'd certainly like to have a stay for a day or two at the EBC and have a look at the level of preparation the summit aspirants have. Having said this, I also heard a people mentioning that the base camp settlers often mark their sites with spray paints for their clients and all sorts of things, that sounds weird. And as we all know you don't wanna have to bivouac there with extreme weather and amount of littering the expeditions cause. The area around EBC is painted yellow with human waste. Marking a site to acquire it is not a new trend as I see, since Rob Hall had a huge area marked as his campsite by spray paints on and around boulders saying "NZ" which meant "New Zealand". With all due respect, that is quite annoyingly stupid. Though it doesn't seem like his direct order, it was his settlers who might have done that. If I be stubborn and insist to have a stay, is it necessary to have a campsite booked or reserved if that is the right word to use? How much this stupid booking thing may cost considering a busy season? I can still make it a way-back day schedule, but asking just in case I want to or I may have to camp there at EBC. Note: The base camp I am referring to is from Nepal side. 

Since 2000 there are only 3 recorded death by cougar in North America and all of those were day time. wiki Cougar attacks are up but still rare on the west coast. Up in CA as partly because cougar hunting is not allowed and the numbers are climbing. In OR and WA dogs cannot be used to hunt cougar. According to the link below since 1990 10 non-fatal attacks and 3 fatal attacks have occurred in CA. Does Oregon Have A Cougar Problem As for precaution I would not camp with a small lamb as bait. Other than that seal up your food and store it way from the main camp. They have a much higher leap (vertical) compared to bears so would need to go much higher than a regular bear bag and they are very good climbers. Pepper / bear spray is reported to be effective. Nathan added a very good point in they are very good hunters. Attacks are very, very, very, rare but if you are attacked there is a good chance you won't even see it coming. You could drop a cougar with a hand gun in the rare, rare, chance one does decide to attack they will close quickly and you would need to be pretty darn good with a gun. I would go with pepper spray. I was raised in WA and never saw a cougar but I did see one in Big Bend National park. He / she looked right at me and kept on walking. I was not concerned. 

One company (sorbentsystems) includes this line in some product description (but not on every mylar product): 

As general rule a physical assessment is necessary as it can be the result of compensation for other problems (flat feet or hyperlordosis for example, just to name a couple). The treatment involves stretching the Iliotibial Band itself (eventual thickening cant be reduced that way but the ITB is attached to muscles so stretching that has a direct effect on those), taking care of the muscles and trigger points that refer to the area and a series of stretching and strengthening exercises, but they would do nothing if the causes aren't addressed properly. Recent studies have changed a bit the traditional belief that ITB syndrome is due to friction. They have shown that it might be associated with the compression of an highly vascularized and innervated fat pad between knee and ITB or a damage to the Periosteum (the outer layer of tissue covering the bone) at the ITB attachment. 

The answer to "it is considered in the temperature rating" can be yes, no and maybe... Really it depends on the manufacturer and how they test it. It also depends where the manufacturer market is: in some part of the world there are some standards and in others there aren't. One of the ways to find the rating is to test in a controlled environment with a mannequin wired with heat sensors and warmed with an electric current. They base the rating on the measure of electricity required to maintain the mannequin at a constant temperature. On top of that a manufacturer might conduct some field tests to end with a relatively realistic rating. If tested in that way the presence, or not, of cold spots would affect somewhat the results so you could say that the construction is taken into account in the rating. Other manner of testing could be, completely or in part, based on simple number crunching and in that case it would be difficult to really account for construction unless they do so presuming a "fudge factor" dependent on it (its up to you in this case to decide if this kind of testing is of any value in making a choice between models). Concerning construction in itself you have various configurations, even the same manufacturer will use different ones depending on the kind (simple and economical vs the more expensive and sophisticated) and usage (summer, winter, extreme etc). An evolution of the H chamber (the box construction) is the trapezoidal chamber, if you keep going on evolving the trapezoidal along the same line you end with the V. The intent is to reduce the possibility of cold spots along the stitching lines. Even more sophisticated is a brick construction where two layers of boxes alternate (like bricks) but that is complicated and cost more than increasing the fill in a V. 

Basic materials have not changed that I am aware of. The basics are carbon steel and stainless steel. All steel has carbon but they seem to use carbon steel to designate it is not stainless steel. Stainless steel resists corrosion (rust). Low carbon is softer (less brittle). The alloys are pretty standard. knife-blade-materials The number of knives over $100 has increased. Benchmade has very few knifes that retail for less than $100. If your knives are sharp they should perform like current knifes. Not steel but ceramics are getting more popular. They hold an edge but are brittle. Limited number of ceramic pocket knives. Mainly used in the kitchen for vegetables. CCB 

There has to be a balance somewhere. Limited trails still limits the use and in a way you are concentrating impact to a smaller area. People clear land all the time and don't create an imbalance. Ranchers even introduce domestic animals without creating an imbalance. 

High end colored tape like used for marking climbing gear or nail polish. Like a gaffers tape. Nail polish is just a paint can get in a lot of colors and small quantity. 

For a rope ladder you are going to need to inspect the cockpit of the boat for a place to anchor. Problem is they try and keep the cockpit clear of that type of stuff as it catches rope, toes ... You could fabricate one from rope or webbing with a couple loops. Tie it to the main and hang it off the stern. You may be able to use a sheet cleat but when you put weight straight down it may pop the cleat and it is hard on the cleat. Since it is a racing level is is not really designed mooring cleats or a fixed ladder. A portable solid ladder you hang on the stern and store in the hatch may be the way to go. Steal the rigging is lot more money then steal a ladder.
