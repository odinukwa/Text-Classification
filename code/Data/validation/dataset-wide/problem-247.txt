Essentially there isn't anything in hard science beyond maybe some of the ideas with magnetism and plasma. Active defenses (interceptor missiles, lasers, etc) are more plausible but still tricky. Just dodging and getting out of the way is surprisingly effective, there is a lot of space out there and with no atmosphere to carry shockwaves near misses do very little damage. If you have gravitational control in your universe then it's not hard science but you can see manipulated gravity fields being plausible as a defense mechanism. They could divert incoming fire away from your ship or even suck it into miniature black holes! 

At night the rings would act a little like the moon, in that you would see the rings glowing to both the east and the west (although once in the shadow of the planet the glow would stop). During sunrise and sunset the illuminated part of the rings would be on the opposite side of the sky from the sun. Looking towards the sun it would potentially only be visible as a darker band if it moves in front of the sun. The rings would be very useful for navigation, telling position and direction would be much simpler than on earth. 

Scientifically it is not possible to regrow limbs in the sort of time-frames we are talking about here, however the same effect could be achieved at least for a while. Have an alien creature with the main brain inside the body. Each head only has the intelligence required to improve its mouth-eye co-ordination for reflexes. The necks do not use bones but instead have a hydraulic reservoir that is pumped full of liquid to inflate them and fill the role of bones. The hydra actually grows many heads and stores them coiled up and deflated inside its body. Due to space and energy constraints it normally only has a few heads active at any one time. A natural reflex should one head be severed then immediately has it push out and inflate two more heads from its internal storage. To someone watching the heads would appear to emerge and grow extremely rapidly and replace the one head with two. Once the threat is over it would deflate and return some of the heads to storage and gradually regrow the missing ones and replace any lost hydraulic fluid. Why would something like this evolve though? I suggest two mechanisms that reinforce each other: 

The other answers are correct, there's no direct way to do what you are looking for as a "poison". It might be possible with some form of chronic illness or the very innovative high pressure area. There is an alternative though, which is that you actually make the antidote the problem. Find something that has really nasty withdrawal symptoms and then pump his system full of that. So long as he keeps taking it he is fine but if you remove it then the withdrawal kills him. That's closest to what you seem to want in that it doesn't require any special architecture or facilities, just something to keep slipping him a daily dose of the substance. The cure would be weaning him off it gradually (i.e. he gathers a stash and takes it with him then takes gradually reducing dosages) possible accompanied by medical care and/or something to mitigate the withdrawal. 

Most of our world is now ruled by Representative Democracy. People vote for representatives and those representatives then decide on laws and make executive decisions. The only certainty in life though is change, and the power structures of countries are no more immune to that than anything else. There are a lot of problems with representative democracy and as a result a lot of people are not satisfied with how things are working at the moment. This has been expressed throughout the world with consequences ranging from being as terrible as civil wars and as hopeful as the rise of organisations like change.org and 38 degrees. The limitations of representative democracy include: 

The simplest way is to have the organisation be a loose collective. Each master will train apprentices, when some of those apprentices become masters some inherits the previous masters school but some others go out into the world to set up their own. Some of the new schools flourish, some don't. Over time similar (but maybe slowly diverging) classes grow up and study in each of these schools. Sometimes the split is amicable and the school and masters remain friendly. Sometimes it is anything but and anything from bitter rivalry to full on enmity springs up between these schools. 

It seems like he doesn't really need money at all. He simply goes to the bank (or a loan shark if needed) spends the money on whatever luxuries he wanted to try and then resets time to before the loan after having his fun. Beyond that look for "big events" with unexpected outcomes. For example a minor sports team winning, or a horse race with a long-odds winner, or even things like political events where the predictions are wrong. He can then go bet on those and rapidly increase his starting stake - odds of ten to one are easily possible so doing this two or three times in one day would let you increase 100$ to 10 thousand dollars in just one or two days. Once you get a larger starting capital then move to the stock markets. Look for any large shifts and then go back in time and either short or long the relevant stock just before the shift. Doing that would then let you steadily increase your cash until you were able to switch to more conventional investments and let the money just increase by itself. Note that a string of such investments would draw attention, allegations of insider trading, etc. You'd want to remain completely clear from any contact with people from companies you are investing in to help protect you from that. 

Not with any known natural planetary body. The density of the planet would need to be far lower than any known material for this to be possible. An artificial structure might be able to do this (for example a hollow sphere you walk around on). Alternatively the use of technology would allow this if anti-gravity fields of some kind were available. One last option might be a planet with an extremely rapid spin. You could land on the equator and centripetal effect (the spin of the planet throwing you off) would counteract some of the gravity. Get the balance right and it would be survivable, the planet would be an odd shape though (very flattened) and have some wicked weather systems. There's an old-school hard sci-fi novel called "Mission of Gravity" set on just such a world although from what I remember even there it wasn't as extreme in size as you are suggesting. 

You already gave the answer in your question - intelligence. With intelligence comes the power to change themselves and their environment. Their supreme adaptability (access to both sea and land) is also a very strong benefit, expect them to live in coastal areas and access resources of both terrain types. For example harvesting wood from the land for spears that are used to hunt fish in the sea. For swimming they would need at the minimum flippers, whether these are natural and can fold up to move on land or are artificial is really an artistic decision either would work perfectly well. They may well develop some sort of "skirt" made of flexible elastic material that they wrap around their legs for underwater work. This will turn their legs into a single tail without needing muscle strength to do so. Alternatively they may evolve webbing between their upper legs combined with feet that can grasp onto each other. When they enter water the feet grab each other to lock together, the same action releasing flukes that spread out and allow them to swim far better than a human. 

You have two mutually incompatible goals, so it's going to be hard. The only real option is to create an "elite". Pick the best and brightest and bring them into the elite, selective breed them to make them smarter. Educate them and indoctrinate them. They need to think they are "better" than the masses so they deserve the special treatment. The others are beneath them. You can shape the social information and beliefs with suitable propaganda while leaving their scientific development alone. That will stop most of them from getting pesky thoughts about helping out all the people you are repressing. You might have to kill off a few outliers but there's always more bright people coming along from the rest of the elites.
