I have a hybrid bike and under description for Spokes it says "Stainless PG"...but when I look for spokes there are a multitude of sizes, thicknesses, butted, double-butted, etc.! How do I know what to get for my bike to replace a broken spoke? 

A simple change might be to get your bike properly serviced. Re-greasing, realigning, re-cabling etc. can all make a significant improvement when combined. You'll change gear more smoothly, brake better and more predictably, the freewheel will spin more cleanly and without brakes intermittently grabbing because of an untrue wheel, pedals will spin more freely, tyres will be the correct pressure...etc. etc. As mentioned above, also look to get the seat and bars to the best height for you. Finally, look at changing tyres to something with a flat centre strip, but grips on the sides. Ideal for road commuting because you get most of the benefits of a smooth tyre when going straight, but grip when you corner. Something like this perhaps $URL$ 

The following image is of the drive side of the front disc rotor (where the rotor is pressed into the inboard pad.) 

I've got a cheap new rear wheel. Disassembled the cones etc and replaced with my own grease. When trying to adjust the bearings to the correct tension, it gets to a point where the axle will make small movements smoothly, but will suddenly give a lot of resistance. If i turn the axle (not the cone), back to where it was smooth, there is still play in the axle, suggesting the axle should be rotating smoothly the entire 360 degrees. When I remove the cones, I usually see that one of the bearings has 'jumped' out of its position and on top of one of the others. What could be causing this? It's new so there's no pitting or corrosion. I think I used an acceptable amount of grease and there are 9 bearings each side. 

If the bike is older and not been used very much...get a full service done. You could be losing a huge amount of power simply overcoming gunked up bearings and binding pedals etc. Many people still ride old bikes very successfully, and an expensive bike then should still be very functional now. 

I'm riding a hybrid with 48/36/26 chain ring and 9 speed 11-32 cassette. When I change up OR down at a specific point the shift is slow and doesn't always engage. On the 48 this is between the 21 and 19 cogs and on the 36 this is between the 24 and 21 cogs. Note that this is rear change only and both up AND down shifts. Every other change is clean and quick. Any ideas gratefully investigated as these changes are right in the "daily range" I use for commuting! 

You're absolutely right--children's bicycles with training wheels are good for exercise and entertainment, but they do little to nothing for balance. In my experience, the best way to teach anyone--children included--to ride a bicycle is to take the pedals off, lower the seat, and let them scoot & coast around until they develop the proper balance. Then, add the pedals, and let them coast, pedal, etc. For children, there are several popular brand that makes 'run bikes', which are usually made out of wood, and have neither training wheels nor pedals. They are low enough that the child can sit in the saddle and place both feet on the ground, but high enough that they can still propel themselves & lift their feet to coast. These bikes allow the child to quickly and safely develop good bicycle balance. (See $URL$ $URL$ and $URL$ 

I have found before that if you decide to do the quick release up tighter than usual it can tighten up the bearings a little too much and you might hear a fairly regular noise as the wheel rotates. I'm not sure I would call it a 'scratching' noise, but maybe that's it. Try a looser quick release adjustment. If the noise remains the same then you can rule this idea out. 

I'm setting up some Avid BB5s. As I tried to bed in the brakes, the front one squeals quite heavily, the back does not. The following image is of the non-drive side of the front disc rotor. (Where the outboard pad hits.) 

I am currently using Wahoo to track my cycling (daily commute) mainly because it can upload automatically to Nike+/Fuel so it keeps all my running etc. in the same place. I've tried googling, but can't find another app that offers this feature, without having to export/import. Does anyone know of a better alternative to Wahoo that also allows uploads direct to Nike+?

As a rule of thumb for road bikes...watch the pro's on a grand tour mountain climb. They VERY rarely stand on the pedals, even when making a break off the front. Often the reason you see them standing is when they are losing momentum and don't want to shift gear...but they sit back down at the earliest opportunity. You might see one stand for a short burst, but watch those around them...mostly they will still be seated. 

Notice the marks where the pad material has transferred onto the rotor in each picture. The marks end further inward toward the centre of the disk on the outboard pad side, than on the side where the inboard pad hits it. Because of the way the brake works (bending the rotor at an angle as it is pushed into the stationary inboard pad), this would make sense to me as the very top of the rotor hits the inboard pad, and because of the angle, leaves a gap lower down. But is this how BB5s are supposed to be? I say this because the while a similar thing is happening on the rear rotor, it is not quite as pronounced (ie, the inboard pad side seems to be hitting a smidge more square on, and does not squeal). I have played around with different pad adjustments as well as caliper alignment. I've tried the sanding the rotor and pads trick. And it's new so nothing is contaminated and I've used alcohol on everything just to be sure. Nothing seems to make any difference either with trying to bring the position of the inboard pad lower as it makes contact, or the squealing itself. I took it to my LBS, he seems to think it's an acceptable set up and just needs riding, but did not say why the rear seems to be acting differently to the front, despite setting them up in the same way multiple times. Could it be a slight manufacturing defect on the front one that causes the inboard pad to sit at a slight angle (it's not totally clear with the naked eye). 

I think the investment casting of the entire headtube is something particular to BMX bikes. It makes sense, for reasons outlined below. Typical parts of a bicycle which can be investment-cast are: 

In the past, when I commuted to a job without showers (I've managed to luck out recently) I made sure to: 

This seems like an example of 'if it's broke, don't fix it'... I understand how it might be bothersome or annoying, but modern shifters such as these are relatively complex and can be easily 'messed-up'. That said, the best solution I could find is the manufacturer's maintenance manuals, which is somewhat lacking. Unfortunately I don't think there are many people who've worked on this specific shifter that can answer your question. 

Trying to take the freehub body off my bike. The bike is a fairly low end Raleigh Shimano Tourney set up. I got a 12mm hex, inserted it into the hex groove on the freehub side and tried to turn it anti-clockwise. It will not come off. Gone so far as to use fit an adjustable wrench on the hex shaft for more leverage and use a deadblow hammer on the end of it. (Shorter end of the hex not quite long enough to use it in the other orientation that would supply better leverage). Are freehubs meant to be on this tight or am I doing something wrong?
