The reason Carbon and Nitrogen are rare on Earth compared to their abundance in space is because elements containing carbon and nitrogen didn't survive the heat of the sun at Earth's distance during the protoplanetary disk stage. Carbon can form carbonate rock, but only under certain circumstances. Carbonate rock is rare in space and most of the carbon is in the form of Carbon dioxide. Oxygen, unlike Carbon or Nitrogen, bonds readily with Silicon, Magnesium, Iron and other heavy elemets, which is why Oxygen is very abundant in rocky planet formation. It's one of the elements abundant in space-dust, unlike CO2, H20, CH4, NH3, which can form, in colder regions, ice or snow like formations as they begin to clump together, but only in cold regions of space. The sun didn't precisely have an "event", though young stars after formation can be much more violent. The initial heat of formation can be very bright and very hot, and young stars are usually rotating very fast and prone to much bigger solar storms and very large mass ejections. Pretty much all stars go through a violent youth. It's not a unique event to our solar-system. Common elements in space, such as CO2, H20, CH4 and NH3 are gaseous at Earth's distance from the sun and as a result, are unlikely to stick to anything in the Earth's formation region. This is true for all 4 inner planets and likely all rocky worlds. Rocky planets likely can only form close to their star, just as gas giants, ice giants or other icy abundant bodies like comets and low-density moons, can only form further out. Gases like the 4 above can begin to be retained around a planet after it reaches a sufficiently large mass with low enough surface temperature to retain those gases by gravity. The boundaries where CO2, H20, CH4, NH3 and other gases can be found in the protoplanetary disk is called the frost line. Different gases have different frost lines depending on their freezing point. It's thought that much of Earth's water, CO2, CH4 and NH3 came to the Earth by comet after the planet formed. There's still some uncertainty on the percentages, as some of those elements could have been trapped during formation. Just to add, hydrogen and helium are obviously abundant, but will only begin to accrue around a planet of a certain mass. In our solar-system, only Jupiter and Saturn are massive enough to accrue hydrogen and helium. That's why Uranus and Neptune are relatively low on hydrogen and helium compared to the universal abundance. Argon is in Earth's atmosphere because it forms from gradual radioactive decay of Potassium-40. Earth's Helium is also present as a result of radioactive decay. 

If, for example, you were to release several billion tons of Ozone on the surface of a planet to increase it's greenhouse effect, the effect wouldn't last long because because ozone is for the most part an unstable molecule. It needs to be constantly recreated because it tends to chemically react and stop being Ozone very quickly for an atmospheric gas. As noted in the quote above, motor vehicle exhaust has increased the atmospheric material that ozone gets created from in our lower atmosphere, so there are man-made reasons for the increase in tropospheric ozone concentration, 237 ppb in 1750 to 337 ppb today. This reference from the Wikipedia article, notes that the Ozone layer has a minor cooling effect, (Source article here), quote from footnote 6 

It's definitely the inverse square law. I've done enough reading up on tidal forces to be sure of that. The formula also clearly shows it as a product of inverse square too. See here or just google "Tidal force formula". - Google's a handy shortcut for looking up formulas. But I get what you're saying. Thinking about it gets a little complicated. This website gives a better explanation than I'm likely to. As a rule of thumb, the tidal force is equal to the size of the object in the sky (distance from the center of the Earth, so near by objects don't count), times the density. The Sun and Moon are about the same size in the sky, the Moon is more dense, so the Moon causes greater tides. 

Source: $URL$ The variation in their chart appears to be similar to the 0.7 variation we should expect from the NASA article, average to low range. There's also the, all but guarantee that CO2 will continue to rise, at least, for several more years, so the APS estimate is likely to go up. Also, the APS number doesn't include feedback mechanisms - and they say as much in the article linked above: 

A number of other articles, including Wikipedia give the start of the Ogliocene as 33.9 mya. And if we take 400,000 years preceeding from the 33.5 mya mentioned in the paragraph, that works out nicely to 33.9 mya. The paragraph seems to be saying that there was an 8.2 degree drop culminating in the period 33.9 and 33.5 mya. Presumably that drop is from the peak temperature at PETM. And following that 400,000 year period of colder temperature at the start of the Ogliocene. Then there was a 2 degree (warming?), or 2 degree variation, beginning around 33.5 mya. The article mentions 2 degrees and implies but doesn't specifically say that it was 2 degrees of warming. The line-chart shows a slight upward trend and some variation following the initial drop 33.9 to 33.5 mya. 

There is a jump in density between the liquid and solid core, which makes sense. For the most part, an element in solid state is dense than in liquid state (Ice/Water is a rare exception). By this table below, the bottom of the liquid core (density 12.2) is less dense than the top of the solid core (12.8). If we use that as a rule of thumb, that's a 5% increase in density as the phase of the Iron-Nickle-otherstuff transitions from solid to liquid. 

(yes, I just quoted you twice) That article just above suggests the stretching and squashing of the Earth, both due to the Moon and the Sun would have an effect, so in a sense, the Orbit around the Sun might affect the magnetic field, but more the tidal effects from the Sun than the actual orbit itself. Because this field remains unresolved, we should never say never until it's better understood. 

In the interest of clarifying this a bit. A Study has the purpose of acquiring knowledge. Many areas of science are fields of study. Nearly everything NASA does is a study. NASA may conduct the occasional experiment, but 98%-99% of what they do is for the specific goal of acquiring knowledge, studying the solar system and universe. The importance of study should not be underestimated. Many fields in science are studied but not experimented on. Astronomy for one. Geology is another one. Some fields of biology and ecology aren't good for experimental testing, but are still studied. An Experiment, under proper control has enough test subjects to overcome any numerical coincidence in the outcome, and a set of fixed criteria with one specific thing changed. We can't run true experiments on climate change in the classical experiment sense because we have only one Earth. We'd need at least two identical Earths to run a proper experiment, and ideally, many more than two. That's obviously impossible. A Research Study can be an experiment or incorporate one or more experiments, but it also, often isn't an experiment. While an experiment is generally quite specific, a research study can be more broad. What your question seems to be asking is about research studies, not experiments. A good research study leaves an equal chance of either a "yes" and a "no" outcome. Bias research is possible, so lets get that out of the way. Unbiased research leaves the outcome entirely and fairly up to the results of the study. Now, a scientist can still have one outcome in mind. He can even intend to prove something, but that intention doesn't guarantee bias, so long as the study is well outlined and fair. Climate change has been subject to numerous research studies. I'll list a few. My list below is far from complete. 

Moist air has a lower lapse rate, which explains why the troposphere is highest over warm equatorial Pacific and why it peaks over monsoons. - see this article. It's the surface temperature and water vapor. That's the gist of it. The rotation of the Earth can't account for a troposphere that's twice as high over the equator. The rotation of the Earth (and if we want to get silly, also the Moon's atmospheric tidal bulges) both affect the troposphere some, but they are minor players. Earth's atmosphere shouldn't bulge much more than it's body, about 1 part in 298, even if you multiply that by 4, and I think that's too aggressive a mathematical approach, but even so, that would be less than 1 part in 70 of atmospheric expansion over the equator due to the spin of the Earth. That's very far from the doubling that temperature explains. 

I hadn't thought of that, and probably, but I don't think that would affect it a great deal. When a tidal bulge happens, the entire ocean (from the point of view of land) lifts up. Oceans are very large, so unless the land is very flat for a very long distance, I don't think there's going to be a huge difference. Lets say the tidal bulge peaks at 50 meters. The tidal "wavelength" if you will is 10,000 km from peak to troth. 5,000 km from 50 meters to zero. While it's a sign wave, not a linear drop, if we measure it linearly, which would be an exageration, the tidal bulge drops 1 meter every 100 km of distance. Land usually rises quite a bit faster than that along the coastline almost everywhere. There are some low-lands that would permanently become lakes, but mostly, I'd say at least 90%-95%, you can calculate how far the tide would reach based on meters above sea level. If the land stays flat for a long time, you could adjust downwards. That's my best guess anyway. I'm not really an expert. The bigger issue is the shape of the coastline. Some coastlines focus the tide and effectively increase it. The map above gives a pretty good estimate of that. Basically, when the coastline is convex, the tide is focused and increases and when the coastline is concave, it decreases. The exception being the gulf of Mexico, which has very low tides, despite being a very convex body of water, but the tides are blocked by Florida and many islands. If you slow the orbit of the Moon down significantly, like you said, a moonrise every 6 months, then I think that effect would be largely reduced due to the much slower moving tide. It would have a lot more time to even out. 

Complication regarding proof or evidence based consensus in science is tricky. Should we accept things that we don't understand, that scientists say are so, like the standard model or should we doubt them. That's a philosophical can of worms that I'd rather not open, but I can say this, if you can't follow the science, perhaps you shouldn't take a side. Your time would be better spent learning than doubting. There is no wisdom in naked skepticism. That's something many skeptics would be wise to learn. Skepticism is both great and useless at the same time. Bart Simpson's a skeptic. The dumbest kid in the class can say "I'm skeptical about that", and he can answer every question with those 4 words, but he'll never get any smarter. Applied skepticism is where it's at, and to apply skepticism, you need to understand the argument(s). Good skepticism requires understanding and, after understanding the argument, then you can intelligently apply skepticism. Empty doubt is useless. Good skeptics need to be smart. This is one argument as to why man made climate science is likely true. Because there are no good skeptical arguments against it. Urban heat island - debunked. Cosmic rays - studied, but no evidence found. It's the sun? No, we measure solar output, we'd know. Mars is getting warmer? That's incidental. We're still warming from the last ice age - actually, the opposite is true, we're in a cooling period. Got any others? The climate change deniers have figured out that they don't need science to sell their seeds of doubt, they're just selling doubt, but selling doubt isn't a scientific argument. 

Radon (more specifically Radon-222) is produced in the decay chain of Uranium-238. Radon-223 is also produced by the decay chain of Uranium-235 and Radon-220 is produced by the decay chain of Thorium-232 but both Radon-223 and Radon-220 have half-lives of less than a minute, so they almost never reach the atmosphere where they can be breathed in because they mostly form underground and they decay too quickly to reach the atmosphere. Radon is unusual in that it's the only noble gas along the 4 primary decay chains and only the Uranium to Lead chain produces Radon-222 which has half life long enough to reach the atmosphere and get breathed in. More on decay chains here and here. Uranium-238 has half life of about 4.5 billion years, so about half the Uranium-238 that was present when the Earth formed is still here. It decays very slowly, which is why it's not dangerous to be around Uranium in it's natural form. (though if somebody hands you a block of it, you might still want to wash your hands after touching it - then call national security) . . . but I digress. Radon-222 has a very short half life of 3.8 days, so while the Uranium that produces it decays very slowly, the Radon is highly radioactive and it decays (into other radioactive elements) quite rapidly. If you had a sample of Radon-222 for example, in less than a month, 99% of your sample would be gone. Because it forms slowly and decays quickly it never collects beyond a very trace concentration and it continuously needs to be regenerated. Houses with a Radon problem need to be continuously ventilated because of that regeneration. At least/about two or three times a day I would think (see comment directly below, once a day may be sufficient), but it's worth pointing out that the Radon in houses is so faint that it takes months, if not years, for any kind of health problems to arise. It's kind of a weird thing. It's not dangerous at all to walk through a house with unsafe Radon levels, similar to how it's not dangerous to visit Chernobyl. It's just not a good idea to live there. Radon is also likely to only be a problem in poorly ventilated houses, (basement's especially, because the heavy gas tends to settle) but a good ventilation system should make any house safe. And it's more common in specific areas. There's the problem of keeping the house warm in winter and maintaining ventilation, because ventilation does need to be maintained. Houses can be also built above ground to reduce exposure. As a general rule, it's the ingestion, either breathing or swallowing of radioactive material that's most dangerous. That's why it's a good idea to put on a gas mask to prevent breathing in any radioactive dust or fallout (though a gas mask won't keep gas like Radon out). And it's a good idea to leave your clothes in a separate changing room and shower thoroughly if exposed or walking through radioactive fallout - that has nothing to do with your question, just putting it out there. Also the opposite applies if there's radiation outside from a nuclear accident or bomb- close all windows and try to keep ventilation as close to zero as possible, at least for a day or so until you get instruction on the levels, but . . . I digress. Point is, because Radon is easily breathed in, it's quite toxic even in very small amounts. At the same time, the Radon concentration inside houses with a radon problem is so small, that it still takes months if not years of exposure to lead to problems. That's why Geiger-counters aren't used to test for Radon. There's too little radiation. You need specific Radon detectors.
