There is no need to kill oneself because living or life is not the cause of suffering. Buddhism teaches ignorance, craving & attachment are the causes of suffering. Suffering is created by wrong (mental) views rather than by being alive. 

This did not occur. He was taught meditations on 'nothingness' & 'non-perception'. Refer to MN 26. Obviously, these were some crude form of these meditations rather than the 7th & 8th jhanas developed from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th jhanas. 

If you want to understand MN 135 thoroughly, you can read similar suttas, such as AN 4.197, which use less complex language. More importantly, you need to research in the suttas how the words 'beautiful', 'ugly', 'wealthy', 'poor', 'long-lived', 'short-lived', etc, are used in other contexts, where it will be found these words are used in both psychological & physical contexts. 

If all attention is not on the object, how can you know what is going on? For example, if you must babysit children but instead pay attention to the TV, how can you know what is going on with the children? 

At the previous stage the mind became liberated, open & non-attached. Now, the impermanence of whatever subtle sense objects come to the mind is seen very clearly. Here, the impermanence is so predominant that the mind sees mostly impermanence (rather than specific objects of impermanence). It is like watching a movie at very fast speed. 

The Buddha taught individual people have different dispositions & inclinations (MN 12). This means people should find a religion that suits their disposition and to not harass other religions. For example, the Buddha did not harass other religions. 

Therefore, the attempt to give a mundane dhamma gift to a supramundane stream-winner (or higher) is to be rejected. This is similar to what occurred in MN 140, when the gift of metta by (the unknowing) Pukkusati of calling the Buddha "friend" was later deemed to be inappropriate, thus rejected & the object of confession. 

The teaching of kamma is for puthujanna (common worldlings) that are unable to give up self-view or 'acquisition'. MN 117 states kamma is a defiled (impure) mundane or worldly teaching for unenlightened common people to make merit (be moral ) & avoid self-harm, as follows: 

A tip I can provide is to develop concentration (samadhi), such as by using Mindfulness With Breathing (Anapanasati). An analogy is as follows. If you wish to scientifically examine water, ideally, you take a drop of water & place it under a microscope. You do not walk into a raging surf (in the ocean) with a microscope. Similarly, to observe thoughts in a meticulous manner generally requires a large amount of concentration and a small amount of thoughts. 

This is not by the Buddha but by Bhikkhu Nagasena in the Milindapanha (refer to Wikipedia). Bhikkhu Nagasena was the monk who gave the illogical & false analogy of the candle flame to explain reincarnation. 

Bhikkhu Bodhi has a footnote about this, which I have decided to disagree with, for the sake of alternative view. However, in his footnote, he points out how there are three variations of this Pali text (PTS, Sinhala, Burmese), including 'dham­muddhac­ca­vig­gahitaṃ mānasaṃ' (which he agrees with, namely, 'manasa' as 'mind' or 'thinking') versus 'dham­muddhac­ca­vig­gahitaṃanā' (which I have decided to agree with). BB rejects the later because it would include the word 'conceit' ('ṃanā'), which he believes is suspicious. However, I have decided to disagree with BB and speculate 'ṃanā' is not suspicious because the other term in the phrase is 'uddhac­ca', namely, restlessness. The other word is 'vig­gahita', which means 'taken hold of, seized; seduced by'. 'Conceit' ('ṃanā') is the 8th fetter; 'restlessness' ('uddhac­ca') is the 9th fetter. Here, in the 4th path, the practitioner is a 'non-returner' ('anāgāmi') seized/seduced by two of the final fetters needed to be broken for arahantship. Thus, in this 4th path, the non-returner has already developed tranquility & insight but encounters a speed bump with the 8th & 9th fetters. But the non-returner settles the mind (citta), breaks the fetters and completes the path. Since the sutta is strangely attributed to Ananda about arahants making declarations to him, which is even more bizarre, and since this sutta is both a one-off and has varied versions, personally, I would ignore & reject it. The sutta seems typical of the non-sense found in the Anguttara Nikaya. Bhikkhu Sujato at Sutta Central might take an interest in this. I suggest to start this topic there. 

I think Thani was trying to be a bit Zen with his non-intention. Kamma is common word in Indian culture. It is always personal. This is why the Buddha used it but also depersonalised it. 

I don't know much about Mount Kailash but I trekked in Nepal over 100km with my 18 year old sister when I was 24. My sister was not particularly athletic but we did fine. While I was an athlete, I had been meditating full time for the previous 5 months so I was not exactly doing vigorous exercise. One day of the trek included walking up the very steep 3200 stone steps at Ulleri. We made it fine. 69 Surya Namaskar shows a lot of fitness. Sounds like you will do fine. Maybe walk up a few hills to tone up the leg muscles. The 'spiritual' part is having an open mind to take in the culture & atmosphere. Just go! With faith! I always enjoy looking at the old photographs. Very warm & wholesome memories. It was a very worthwhile experience. Below is the Tibetan side of the Himalaya. 

Buddha-Dhamma is found in the Pali suttas. A Wall Street opinion about what Buddhism may or may not be is obviously not Buddha-Dhamma. It is another type of 'dharma'. Therefore, if the Wall Street Dharma is not free, taking it without paying for it is stealing. Buddhism does not allow stealing from the rich to give to the poor. 

He remembered back to when he was a child & spontaneously entered into the 1st jhana. Refer to MN 36. However, what is not clear here is exactly what is meant here. My view is the Buddha as a child attained jhana via non-attachment & he realised the path of non-attachment is the path to end suffering. This accords with SN 48.10 & the end of the Anapanasati Sutta, which states jhana is achieved by making 'non-attachment' (rather than the breathing) the meditation object. In the correct practise of Anapanasati, the meditation object is non-attachment. The resultant awareness of breathing is merely a sign (nimitta) that the mind is correctly non-attached. The proper translation of Anapanasati is 'mindfulness with breathing' rather than 'mindfulness of breathing'. This distinction is crucial. 

When Gautama left his family to become an ascetic or śramaṇa, he joined many other ascetics or wanderers who were separate from the Vedic-Brahmanism religion. However, when Gautama left his family to become an ascetic, his goal was not political. The Pali scriptures describe when Gautama lived the life of a prince in his palaces, he was very unhappy & disenchanted & also saw how his rich relatives & associates suffered about worldly things, such as money, status, sex & sensuality, which brought little happiness & much trouble & suffering. Therefore, Gautama became an ascetic for the sole purpose of finding a solution to suffering for himself & for the world. Gautama's sole purpose was a Noble Search for Nibbana. Later, after enlightenment, when the Buddha became famous, the scriptures report many Brahmans ('Aryans') came to visit the Buddha to ask him questions about 'caste' or 'birth' ('jati'). Because the Buddha was an honest & ethical man, he spoke the truth to the Brahmans (for example, here, here and here. In Singala: $URL$ ~ $URL$ ~ $URL$ Because the Buddha & many of his enlightened disciples were not from the Brahman caste, the Buddha understood with right wisdom that the highest, most peaceful, wise, virtuous & free state of mind was not related to birth caste (read Brahmanavagga). I would speculate that hundreds of years later, under King Ashoka, many new scriptures were written that were very prejudiced against Brahmans (such as here & here). I say this because in many scriptures, the Buddha is very civil to Brahmans and encouraged them to follow their own religion in a better way. The Buddha did not try to convert anyone to Buddhism unless he knew Buddhism was the most suitable path for that person. 

AN 7.58 refers to some methods to overcome sloth & torpor and, given lying down is the final method, it would appear most methods pertain to mental sloth. 

(Disclaimer: Based on human & social evolution, I personally doubt there were any past Buddhas. For example, the Mahāpadāna Sutta appears state the very first Buddha had 6,800,000 or 68 lacs arahant disciples; the older the Buddha, the more arahant disciples they had, which seems to contradict historical evidence of human population. The above genre of suttas that number a handful among 1,000s of suttas, which also contradict SN 22.79 in talking about literal 'personal' past lives, I would speculate were later writings rather than words of the Buddha.) 

The Buddha did not teach what the questioner is inferring. The Buddha kept mundane dhamma & supramundane dhamma distinctly separate, as explained in MN 117 about the two sorts of right view. The ideas in the question are ideas created by others at later time. In other words, what is 'reborn' is a 'self' rather than something 'not-self' ('anatta'). 'Rebirth' means the re-arising of self-view. Therefore, what is re-born is always the idea of 'self'. Please read the suttas, accurately. The suttas always state 'a being' ('satta') or person ('puriso') is subject to rebirth due to their own kamma. 

However, just because Buddhism extends tolerance, non-hatred & non-violence towards difference & diversity, this does not mean Buddhism endorses, promotes or recommends all things because Buddhism only endorses, promotes or recommends a moral or non-harming way of life. For example, Buddhism tolerates murder, theft, rape, sexual promiscuity, dishonesty, drug addiction, usury, gambling, businesses that trade in weapons, slavery, prostitution, intoxicants, etc, however Buddhism does not endorse, promote or recommend these things. This distinction is shown in the following text about 'tolerating', 'avoiding' & 'destroying' and in Buddhist teachings about 'right' & 'wrong': 

The Buddha's teaching was originally pure & unique. The synergism occurred when Buddhism traveled from India to China, Tibet, etc. In India, Buddhism also synergised with Hinduism, until it disappeared. When I use the word "unique"; I am referring to the Four Noble Truths and other supra-mundane teachings such as The Three Characteristics, Dependent Origination & Emptiness. Of the Four Noble Truths ,the Buddha said: "These were things he had never before" and called them: "The special teachings of the Buddhas" (MN 56 ). 

In SN 11.5, the 'democrat' gods (deva) & 'totalitarian' titans (asura) have a debate about how to rule people. The gods suggest patience & the titans suggest punishment. If gods is a heavenly place & the titans is hellish state of deprivation, how could the gods & titans have a debate with eachother about ruling the world of ordinary people? Obviously, the 'gods' here refers to benevolent rulers & the 'titans' refer to tyrannical rulers of the human world who engaged in ideological & often military battle with eachother.
