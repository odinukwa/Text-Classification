The "in its essence" part of this answer refers to that it is also effective against certain types of hair loss, mainly those caused by psoriasis. Androgenic hair loss seems to be out of reach for the effects produced by coal tar. Regrowing hair is not reported but there might be some hope for slowing down the process.

Conclusion Stevia seems not to be detrimental for reproductive health, its use as a contraceptive in far away places seems to have at least decreased, if it was ever reported correctly. Recent findings do not corroborate this contraceptive effect. 

Although the article above is overoptimistically applying all reports into the evidence basket it has to acknowledged that the indications start to paint a clearer picture. Since further research is always required, this is doubly so for promising results from in vitro studies. So how about actual rats: Antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic potential of Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench. in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats: 

Summary West-Germany officially avoided to call the Basic Law "constitution" in order to amply its claims to be the sole rightful successor or the continuation of the German Reich, claiming all its former lands and territories in 1949. The official reasoning given at the time was that naming the provisional constitution "constitution" would acknowledge the final separation of Germany into two independent states and relinquish the rightful claims to former eastern territories. They avoided to call the Basic Law a constitution after 1990 in order to highlight that they technically violated the interim constitution's laws and provisions to explicitly create an entirely new and real constitution that would have to be subjected to popular vote in 1990, once Germany would be a unified sovereign state again in 1990. After the merger of 1990 they simply changed a few articles in the interim constitution to make it final. Germany also avoided to sign anything called "peace treaty", for a number of reasons, among them to avoid reparations for World War II as well as individual compensation claims, as was agreed to in the London Debt Conference treaty. These wordings, policies, diplomatic manoeuvres and legal tricks provide the basis for the two claims in question. The German government, which the Reichsbürger do not recognise as legitimate, is their witness, ironically. The real government had other reasons than the Reichsbürger proclaim for doing what it did. The de-facto status of the Basic Law as a functioning and legally binding constitution is unchallenged in reality and most of the conclusions drawn by the Reichsbürger from this real conundrum of words are invalid. The fact remains that this is extreme nitpicking of words and interpretations. But this nitpicking was deliberately begun (in 1948/49 to behold!) by the German government itself to avoid the proper words and procedures that were deemed necessary, evidenced by the original Grundgesetz –– and also by the international community as evidenced by the London Debt Agreement: having a constitution, having a peace treaty. In these two claims from the question the Reichsbürger have successfully found two points that are very complicated to explain properly and both points, when viewing their history, leave a shale taste even after explaining them and the situation as it is now. 

That means if Hitler said that, it is only referring to intraparty oppositional forces while the English version might be read as much more general claim about everything enemy. This only compares the 1937 coup within the fascist factions that secured Francos power to Hitlers policy towards his party members, like Goebbels, who was initially opposed to Hitler as Fuehrer within the NSDAP. Again, content wise this also untrue as evidenced by the Night of the Long Knives. Although it may be interpreted as him referring to Franco imprisoning his party internal opponents while Hitler just ordered them killed right away? Conclusion Since the "Table Talk" and books like that are the source for the quote in the compilation that originated the question, many originals of the sources for that book disappeared, or are not accessible, or were just fabricated, regarding that quote we have to conclude: 

These are apparently two claims to analyse: The newspaper report is accurately citing its material. Although this little snippet from the article in question is bit of old news. Foodwatch went public with this report on September 22, 2016, to promote the book „Das Schweinesystem: Wie Tiere gequält, Bauern in den Ruin getrieben und Verbraucher getäuscht werden“ by Matthias Wolfschmidt. (translation: The pig system: How animals are tortured, farmers are ruined and consumers are deceived.) The original press release is here: 

In accordance with the original claim I will mostly not differentiate between the different forms of vitamin D, like cholecalciferol (D3) as formed in the skin or the "active form" calcitriole (D1). Analysis of claims This "Vitamin D is formed in your sebum" (" the vitamin D3 that is formed is on the surface of your skin") is certainly not true in any meaningful amount. But this doesn't stop 'experts on the net' from repeating this claim. Sometimes with reasoning, but without experiments to confirm that. But with ample additional reason, namely the conflict of interest that is called: reasons to sell supplements in the latter: 

Summary Even in it's current iteration there are systemic and structural limitations of how this might work? As a very large error prone estimate it is a nice idea. Trusting this device is foolish. With more sensors, more accurate sensors, to be precise, this might go somewhere. Why not just add an accelerometer to measure your food intake? 

Admitting that the method for their device is too inaccurate for medical use means it is just unreliable overall for measuring blood glucose. Much worse than the above is what this means for the the accuracy of the device measuring the calorie intake non invasively: The current dietary guidelines for the US say that you should eat a varied diet. That is low on added sugar and including fibre, fat and protein. If you eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates the intake is usually not converted into blood glucose, which seems to be the only parameter measured. But these ingredients or meal constituents have a caloric impact!. Unless they demonstrate in an independent study that different diets are estimated by such a device only halfway convincingly, that is high carb as well low carb for example: this is very likely complete bogus. A niche application might be: for kids on the night of Halloween that only eat hard candy (chocolate has way too much fat content) this might work within the error range of 15% off. From a review: 

In recent years these isolated findings are apparently either forgotten by researchers, not replicated or just quoted without reference. But after trying really hard to paint a bad picture of this plant these reproductive effects seem really quite the opposite in reasonable doses: 

One such RA medication recently approved is a pill, not a topical ointment, containing mostly lipophilic chemicals of the plant extract. Of thes ingredients 13-Hydroxyoactedecatrienic acid, which was proven to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, thereby directly interfering with the disease process, among other modes. While it seems quite true that: 

This is a claim that is really easy to make. Banana peel hazards Can you really slip on an old banana peel?: 

(Quoting the competition rules as set forth by Lanka. Highlighting that one scientific publication was required. Translation: "The prize money is paid when one scientific publication is presented in which the existence of the measles virus is not only asserted, but also proved, and among others the diameter of the virus is to be determined.") 

The preamble and article 23 as well as 146 were changed in 1990. The Grundgesetz is now seen and serves as the de-facto constitution of Germany, as a complete state, containing all Germans and German lands that there are. The fact that the German people never did decide about a real constitution "in free decision" is an open wound caused by the decisions then that are now seen as final. These conventions on interpreting the name and the meaning of the Basic Law was drilled and hammered into the heads of every pupil and student in West-Germany for more than 40 years. Official order: Do not call it peace treaty, do not call it constitution There were a number of concrete problems arising from this in 1989 and 1990. Simply expanding the territory via accession into the preliminary was also less complicated and thus faster. Polish and Russian territories were renounced in treaties before 1990 and offered as a pre-conditional renouncement for the unification process to the Soviet Union from the side of West-Germany before talks to these goals even began. Nobody in power wanted the German people to be so sovereign as to let themselves give them a real constitution, as required by the Grundgesetz itself, once all Germans are back in one single state. And in 1952 a little conference in London posited that West-Germany was given a break in paying war reparations to those countries it itself devastated as invader and occupier during the war. A break lasting until a "peace treaty would be signed". When the merger was prepared the West-German government had precisely this in mind and wrote about this little problem explicitly and extensively in internal memos. They were so aware of this problem that they insisted in persuading everyone involved in the talks to not name this 4-plus-2 settlement a peace treaty. "Involved" means here the US, the UK, France and the Soviet Union, but all the other nations attacked by Germany and at war with it during WW2 were explicitly excluded from the talks, like Poland or Greece.
