The answer is clearly yes if consistent means frequent, but seems to be no if consistent is assumed to mean systematic (seems to be because proving a negative is always quite hard). Fascist ideology is positively correlated with expansionism and aggressive militarism but a second key factor is the military might and general geopolitical position of the state in question. Fascist movements in powerful states (in absolute terms or relative to their neighbors) are overwhelmingly military aggressive and expansionist but fascist movements in weak states are not necessarily so and sometimes develop a symmetric Weltanschauung of defense against a dangerous external world, closed borders policies and withdrawal from international affairs. Examples of such could be found in the ideology of the Swiss far right movements, starting with the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband and Nationale Aktion: two movements which embraced many tenets of fascist ideologies but were not military expansionist (at least before the advent of Nazi power for the former). Based on its website, the New Zealand National Front does not seem particularly military expansionist either. 

My grand-mother, a teenager at the time, was part of a fairly active resistance network interacting with the British military. On the wake of the liberation of her area of France, her contact officer was dropped one last time behind enemy lines for no other reason than to warn them that heir area would be liberated the following day and that an American unit was in charge. He advised for everyone, but especially young women, to stay home for a couple of days if they could. As far as she knows, no sexual violence was reported in her area in the ensuing days (all jewelries were robbed the very night of the liberation however). This story suggests that sexual violences were common enough to be considered a real and well-known threat but it is incompatible with the claim that it was systematic. 

In French historiography, it is well-known that one of the first French large military victory against the Germans, the battle of Monte-Cassino, was accompanied by massive rapes of the local population. See here for instance but, if you read French, compare with here which is much better documented and casts severe doubts on some of the most horrendous stories. Similar stories are reported in the aftermath of the battle of Freudenstadt. Though an exact or even approximate number will never be known, an interpolation based on reported cases yields a plausible number of 5 to 15 thousands sexual aggressions committed by the French military. Using a similar methodology, J.Robert Lilly apparently estimated the number of sexual aggressions committed by the American military to be between 10,000 and 20,000 (but I don't know how accurate is his work). Interestingly, I have never read allegations of sexual violence on the part of British soldiers. 

The early Carolingians reviled the Merovingians in order to get the Pope to legitimize their dynasty as kings, and not just rulers, of the frankish kingdoms. This finally happened when Pope Zachary deposed Childeric III in 751 in what can only be described as a very good operation for both: Pépin gained the legitimacy he was after while Zachary ensured the domination of the Catholic Church on the frankish kingdoms (while the Franks had been Christian for several centuries at that point, the frankish bishops of the 8th century had a reputation of indiscipline bordering on heresy, see for instance Aldebert, as well as of venality and the frankish lords were quite tempted to confiscate Church land when they needed it, see for instance the matter brought to Zachary's attention by Boniface before and during the Concilium Germanicum). Besides, he gained a powerful ally able to counter the military threat from the Lombards he was under. Finally, French republican historiography (see for instance Michelet) liked to go at absurd length to make fun of the late Merovingians, in part because as kings without kingdoms they had in the view of the XIXth century French Republicans all the vices of the kings and none of their virtues (the embodiment of the French Nation), in part in repetition of Carolingian propaganda, in part because of the contingent fact that Dagobert the First (in fact one of the most powerful king of Western Europe in the seventh century) was said to have been quite clumsy, as was Louis XVI, and hence became the hero of a very popular song during the French Revolution (the song's popularity, as a children rhyme, endures to this day, so that French children know to mock Merovingians well before they know what a Merovingian is, or in fact what a kingdom is). 

One of the great tactical lessons of WWII, first learned by German generals, is that even a strong army is relatively easy to defeat and relatively incapable of significant fighting if cut from its logistical support. Once so by the redeployment of German forces following Overlord, and especially after the junction of Dragoon and Overlord in mid-September 1944, the remaining western German forces paused no real danger to the allied forces. I add this answer only to promote the following link $URL$ which is a great visual tool to understand the effectiveness of encircling enemy forces. In fact, the only position that survived encircling for a significant span of time was the German position in Stalingrad, and we all know why and how this ended. 

This interpretation of the history of WWII contradicts many well established facts. The most damaging one, in my opinion, is that Stalin actually pleaded for the opening of a significant European Western front in 1942/1943 in order to relieve the pressure on the Eastern front and was in fact disappointed in the Allies insistence that this could not happen before 1944. Also, I think the consensus view on diplomatic relations between the Allies is that Roosevelt was keen on building a strategic alliance with Stalin so that, far from trying to undercut him, he was rather favorably disposed towards an increase in the influence of the USSR (compared to the influence of the traditional European powers). On the other hand, the rapid advance of Montgomery's 21st Army to Lübeck and Rostock in late April, 1945 can reasonably be described along the lines of the question: by that time (but not earlier), it was increasingly clear to Churchill in particular that Stalin's USSR would exert an unlimited influence on all territories behind the front line of the Red Army, so Montgomery's advance was made to preserve Denmark (and, presumably, Hamburg). 

Did the uprisings of May 1968 in Paris over student tuition fees mark the end of a trend of uprisings? No, absolutely not. Then end of a trend of uprisings was la Commune de Paris, or perhaps even the French revolution of 1848. With the latter stopped the tendency for Paris and its population to topple the government of France (by and large, what is known as French Revolutions were revolutions of the Paris region, with the rest of France usually indifferent or actively opposed) while the former is the last large scale uprising against the Government (but it is unclear it would have taken place absent the humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian war). So they were no trend of uprisings to be ended almost a century later. Note in particular that there were absolutely no violent uprisings of any significant scale in metropolitan France during the 70 years of the Third Republic (though this might in great part have been due to social changes having been triggered by the World Wars: many revolutionary new political and social changes were enacted during the World Wars or in their immediate aftermaths). Besides, Mai 68 is much more aptly described as one the largest and most remarkable convulsions that accompanied the profound social changes which took place in between 1950 and 1980 in most advanced democracies than as a violent uprising against the then current Government. In other words, it is much better understood as a symptom of the baby-boom, the explosion of enrollment in higher education and the general change of attitudes towards sexuality and authority than as a political riot per se. Why has there been no revolutionary reactions to national or international crises in the last 50 years. I am aware that there have been major riots since then, but why no revolutions over the GFC, European Union etc? Probably because independent, prosperous, aging democracies very rarely descend into revolutions. If you want a more specific answer, the relative decline of the political, military and plain demographical power of Paris (and its region) compared to the rest of France certainly played a role, as well as the aging of the French population in the last 5 decades. What was the legacy of Mai 68? This is the question implicit in the title, though it is absent in the body of the text. Well, as Lennart Regebro's answer correctly notes, the political legacy was rather unimpressive in the short term. Interestingly, the two most powerful political parties of the time, the Gaullists and Communists, knew severe drawbacks in the the ensuing decade (the latter ultimately disappearing completely as a significant political force, and the former moving from its incredibly dominant position to second place within the French political right). At the level of social change, Mai 68 was part of a movement that changed deeply French social norms. This movement included the lowering of the voting age, the legalization of abortion and contraceptives and generally a much freer vision of sexuality, the generalization of higher education and of employment for both men and women etc. It is unclear to what extent the events themselves played a role, but certainly many concessions were made with a definite fear of students rebellions degenerating in general strike again. From a purely positional point of view, the cohort born in 1948-1952 (so the typical high school graduate or young student in 1968) did very well indeed in economic and political terms through the span of their life (see for instance Le Destin des Générations) and arguably still represent the dominant social force in contemporary France. 

Where to start? Starting from the forced exchange of population between Greece and Turkey in 1923, you will find no shortage of examples, some of truly unbelievable scale. Among the most prominent ones are population transfer and Russian settlements in the former USSR (considering the brutality of the regime, I think it is beyond dispute that these satisfy your second criteria) and the numerous expulsions and relocations (with Poles, citizens of the USSR and ethnic Germans by far the more numerous victims) which took place during the Second World War. Compared to numerous instances in the XXth century, Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are thus in fact quite unremarkable. 

Maybe a word about the Greeks? Around 330BCE, Callipus, a student of Eudoxus at Plato's Academy and of Aristotle at his Lyceum, determined the length of the tropical year (that is to say the interval of time between two vernal equinoxes or two summer solstices) to be 365+1/4 days. He also showed that the four seasons (defined as the interval of time between a solstice and an equinox) had different lengths (maybe the first realization of what we now understand as the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun). Around 120BCE, Hipparchus, one of the most talented astronomer of the Antiquity, determined te length of the tropical year to be 365 days 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is within ten minutes of the exact value. He is considered to be the first to have noticed that this length of time is slightly shorter than the sidereal year (that is to say the length of time between the appearance of the Sun at two identical places with respect to the Zodiac, or in contemporary terms the time taken by the Earth to orbit the Sun once) which he might have estimated at 365 days 6 hours and 10 minutes (might because much of Hipparchus's is only known to us from subsequent quotations). It seems that a lot of the phenomena described above (perhaps all save the discrepancy between tropical and sidereal year) was known to Chaldean (i.e late Babylonian) astronomers around 300BCE, but few primary sources on their knowledge survived.
