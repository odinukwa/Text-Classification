We can see Venus at night (dusk) and in the morning (predawn), just not all night or every night. We need some geometry to understand this, and it boils down to tangents. I've shamelessly borrowed this diagram from a paper to show the idea. It's discussing Mercury, but it's the same idea for Venus. 

Nebulas are not static objects - they evolve. Initially a nebula might contain mostly (as an example) hydrogen, helium and some other elements in a cloud, but over time that material will clump together to form larger and/or denser material. Eventually parts of some nebula can even condense enough to form a star and it's planets. Our solar system was (probably) once part of a nebula. So there's no single answer to your question. They can contain most forms of matter. 

Short answer : yes. Long answer : it's complicated. This is a classic three body problem, and a real example would be the Sun-Earth-Moon system. Unfortunately there is no general solution of the 3-body Newtonian gravity problem, so we have to rely on special methods for special cases and even these turn out to be quite complex. The best answer I could find to your specific question applied to the Sun-Earth-Moon is this one on Yahoo. As you can see the resulting effect is quite a complex set of periodic effects. It's small but not negligible. You can intuitively visualize the effect in such a system by noting that typically to a good approximation the planet-moon system will orbit the star at a considerably larger distance than the planet-moon distance. The planet and moon themselves orbit around their center of mass. The relative difference in gravitational forces between the position where the moon is furthest away and closest will give you a rough guide to the order of magnitude of the effect. A back of the envelope calculation for Earth makes it about a 1% order of magnitude for the Sun-Earth-Moon. Other systems will be different, but there will certainly be an effect. 

A planet in a stable orbit can only receive a finite maximum power from it's star and likewise can only generate a finite energy from internal heat (like our cooling core, which is a tiny power output compared to what we get from the Sun). There's a finite limit to available power. If that power is not radiated out (which is thermal radiation) the planet's temperate would rise without limit. This never happens because hot things radiate heat (as EM radiation) to try and reach thermal equilibrium with their environment (which in the case of a planet is the very cold space around it). So there must be a finite limit to the temperature any planet in a stable orbit can reach. As @Cody indicated the actual point of maximum temperature may not be at periapsis. Atmospheres can act in complex ways to raise the temperature of the surface significantly. Venus is a prime example as this page demonstrates. Without it's pressure cooker-like atmosphere we'd expect a temperature of around 240 K, whereas it's actually a rather staggering 740 K. But all of that is solar powered and can't rise without limit. But it illustrates the importance of atmospheric composition (and indeed the Greenhouse effect) on planets. Update : I came across another page on the basic theory of planetary temperature while looking into something else. It may be of use so I've added it in this edit. 

This simply places an upper limit on the mass of neutrinos. Wikipedia's article quotes this as 16 eV from that experimental data and I've no reason to argue with that. But the failure to overtake doesn't say any more than this. 

Well the current values place the upper limit at around 1/30,000 th of the electron mass. That's "very small" in my book. So Fermi had it nailed pretty good : good scientist, that lad. :-) Just a few items of importance show how much has changed : 

Wikipedia (where would we be without it) has a handy list of mathematical symbols which is pretty useful in this context. Note that in particular : 

What is "interesting" depends on your personal outlook. I can think of any number of living breathing entities on this planet I wish I did not have to speak with. A life form that just lies in a Petri dish and does nothing else sounds quite pleasing sometimes. From a scientific point of view, I don't see how any scientist could regard the acquisition of information, like a form of life not evolved on Earth, as unimportant. To me the difference between "I think this is likely to happen anywhere conditions are favourable" and "I actually found it" is pretty much the definition of good science. 

I think you're looking for something like the Solar Analog. My impression, by the way, is that the Sun itself is not a medium sized star, but is smaller than average for stars in this galaxy. 

And we've kind of a large number of space based satellites that do nothing but monitor the Sun and all the people monitoring them would certainly spot this minor event. 

I don't think it's possible for anything to exist at the event horizon for any time. It's a surface of zero thickness (as I understand it) and no actual substance. Nothing can stop there and no real thing could be said to be "on" the horizon, just passing through it. One of the complication of discussing black holes in relation to things like quantum-scale elementary particles is that while we can't say exactly where a particle is (the uncertainty principle) "classical" general relativity (i.e. without quantum theory) doesn't incorporate this at all and so the idea of a particle having a precise position is perfectly reasonable in classical general relativity. But that's unlikely to be the case in whatever theory we end up with that links general relativity and quantum field theories. I suspect you are hearing things related to the Holographic principle. This is pretty much beyond my real understanding in any depth, but note that it is intimately linked with trying to connect String Theory, gravity (and hence a kind of quantum gravity), Thermodynamics and a notion of "information" within those multiple contexts. I personally don't intend to try and read too much into this as it's beyond cutting edge theory for me (beyond my "event horizon" I suppose :-) ). However I'd suggest being wary of reading too much into this idea given the present state of the theories involved. 

The problem here is that you're thinking in a common, everyday sense about something that fundamentally is not understandable using common everyday sense. One of the major problems people face learning even special relativity is that common sense ideas (like simultaneity) go out the window, and this is even more difficult in general relativity. To understand how space-time is distorted in such extreme ways requires an understanding of the mathematics. The simple explanations that involve things like rubber-sheet analogies just don't give you the right idea at all. A typical tool to explore space-time and how it distorts is a Carter-Penrose diagram. Another one is the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. So really the problem here is you trying to use your common everyday sense in a situation that it does not work in. The reason physicists do all that complex mathematics in the first place is because that is what works. 

Your guess is as good as any cosmologist's. We don't know how it came into being, not with any confidence. There are theories, but nothing definitive has emerged to explain where it all came from. This may be hotly disputed by proponents of each theory, but we're not there yet, IMO. We're not sure yet about what all the relevant forces are ( e.g. dark matter, dark energy ) so any theory about how those affect possible futures is simply a complicated guess at this point. This alone, IMO, makes conjectures about the universe's future pointless, IMO. 

Totally dependent on the details. A rogue planet could be any mass from Pluto to 10 Jupiter masses - quite different gravitationally. And exactly what it's trajectory was makes a huge difference. If it came barreling into the inner system it could cause chaos, particularly a large body. It would certainly have to pass thought the Oort cloud and possibly the Kuiper Belt. Any appreciable mass doing would disturb many, many objects which have the potential to fall into the inner solar system (or not). So that alone could be dangerous for us (or not). It's a dice throw - quite random from our point of view. Stable is relative. If it disturbed orbits in such a way that in a hundred thousand years Earth would become uninhabitable that might be not too bad - a lot can happen to a species in that time scale, especially one armed with nukes. :-) So this isn't a question with a single answer. 

Although the Sun was less luminous 4.5 billion years ago (about 70% of it's current luminosity, it is thought), and while this would affect it's color, making it perhaps a little more orange than yellow, the effect is small. The Sun is still going to be a blazing near-white object in the sky of roughly the same size. Although there was probably a color shift to a slightly more orange tint, the composition of the Earth's atmosphere was radically different (see for example this page on Paleoclimatology) and this would have had a much more significant effect on the appearance of the Sun (and the lighting of the landscape) than any minor change in the Sun's appearance. There are some issues relating to the development of life and this change in the Sun's luminosity (like the Faint Young Sun Problem) but these won't make much difference to your rendering, I think, compared to the atmospheric and climate issues. However the climate changes are not fully understood and it's rather speculative to try and make specific claims about what the overall effect would have been on the illumination levels and color of light reaching the surface in these periods. 

The maths says that the semi-major axis is not a good measure of average distance for high eccentricity (elliptical) orbits. There are basically two ways to measure this : (1) an average over the entire orbit on a purely geometric basis, and (2) the average over time. These give quite different results - qualitatively different. Average distance on geometric basis. In a way this is the most obvious one. The mathematics is : $$R_g = \frac a {2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi}r\,d\theta$$ And we use for an ellipse : $$r = \frac \rho {1+\epsilon\,cos\theta}$$ The result is (eventually :-) ) : $$R_g = a\,\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2} \tag{1}$$ Average over time. This is a tricker calculation, but in fact it's the most "human" average. We want : $$R_t = \frac 1 T \int_0^T r\,dt$$ The maths on this is tedious and not at all useful, but the result ( with a little help from Wolframalpha.com ) is : $$R_t = a\,\frac 2 {\pi} \frac{2+\epsilon^2}{(1-\epsilon^2)^{\frac 5 2}}tan^{-1}\left( \sqrt{\frac {1-\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} \right) \tag{2}$$ Now by any definition that's a messy equation, but the main point is to note the key difference between the time averaged expression (2) and the geometric one (1). The geometric expression gets smaller as eccentricity gets larger. The time averaged one gets larger as eccentricity gets larger (a slight simplification). In fact for both $\frac R a$ starts off at $1.000$ but when $\epsilon\to 1$ then $R_g\to 0$ and $R_t\to \infty$ ! Why ? The geometric expression doesn't allow for the orbital speed of the object. As you increase eccentricity an orbits ends up with having a faster close approach, so less time close up to it's primary. As it moves away from the primary, the orbital speed also decreases, so it spends much more time at large distances than at short distances. 

Over time, small objects relatively close together at the start will be pulled into quite different orbits by the perturbations of larger objects (like Jupiter) and even Earth if they approach closely. Relatively small changes at close approach can have quite large effects when the objects reach their furthest approach. The orbits are approximately elliptical (some may be hyperbolic) and the orbital velocity will vary in such an orbit (unlike a circular orbit). So you'll see objects drifting along at the furthest reach of their orbit and speeding up as they "fall" in to the closest point of their orbit. They'll again slow down as they "rise up" away from the closest approach (exactly as a stone you throw into the air). So the combination of these things means that the objects can separate significantly over time into quite distinct orbits that have quite significant differences in orbital velocities. 

It becomes more and more distorted and then less and less distorted. As the range of the gravitational field is infinite, it never actually is undistorted. There is no permanent effect on space-time (e.g. nothing like a track "goughed" through space-time). However, as the space-time is distorted there is a kind of permanent effect in the sense that e.g. an observer could see an object passing through such a gravitational field as experiencing a time dilation relative to the (distant) observer. That would be permanent in the sense that the difference in the time observer and object calculate is not going to be undone. The rate at which time changes will return to normal, but not the accumulated time they each record, which will remain different (in the absence of the observer passing through a similar distortion in space-time).
