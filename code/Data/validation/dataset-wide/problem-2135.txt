When you get a question that shows no research effort, simply reply with a question. "What have you tried?" or "What have you been able to find out about what may be causing this problem?". If they don't have an answer then simply tell them to come back when they have some effort to show. Make it absolutely clear that you do not answer bad questions. Point out that there are already solutions to most of their questions available on the internet (Stack Overflow). Tell them to go search there first before asking any kind of question not directly related to how you do it at your company. As the old saying goes: 

Do not get manipulated by the CC. CC'ing the email to somebody higher up the ranks then you is an easy (dirty) way to make the problem seem like it's yours. Ignore the CC. Be firm — not rude — when replying to bad questions. It is highly unlikely that your management will have a problem with this (as long as you stay friendly). In the case that they do decide to talk to you about it you still have a strong argument for not answering bad questions. You have a job to do — things to get done — and bad questions are a waste of company time. 

Is it appropriate to bring a copy of the APIs for languages listed on your resume, in anticipation of technical / coding / whiteboard questions? This could be perceived as either ignorance or preparedness (and an awareness for the situation). This would be difficult with with a hardcopy, but feasible with a phone or small tablet, especially if they are made available offline. Obviously, if the interviewer wants to test memorized knowledge, they can ask (or you can offer) to perform the task without it. For Non-Programmers: API stands for Application Programming Interface and is used by programmers to interact with common functions made available by a programming language. 

Well I really messed up: A small batch of custom resumes were perfect and typo free, however, they were not converted to PDF correctly and as a result there was additional personal information from another document included at the bottom of the resume. The mistake is obvious and will most likely result in receiving no call backs from these employers; this field is unforgiving of these types of errors that scream incompetence. My question is that while there is nothing I can do to correct the mistake and become a "serious candidate", I would like to at least get the sloppy resume updated in their database, so as to remove the personal information as well as hopefully prevent it from being seen in the future, in case I have later dealings with these companies. Is a short letter saying "I made a mistake and would appreciate it if they could replace the faulty resume with the correct one" appropriate or understandbale? Please note that these resumes were emailed, not uploaded into a web-based database (otherwise I would just update it myself). Will an HR Manager even do this? Anything else to add in order to soften the blow... like a note taking responsibility for the mistake and an apology for the inconvenience? 

No, you should not leave. It is only a week we are talking about and you are likely to learn something in that time. If the problem was you getting harassed, picked on, or something similar then I would probably recommend leaving (as it is such a short time frame). However, in your case I would say that staying just for the sake of showing yourself that you can cope with less than perfect circumstances at work will be worth it. You will be proud of completing the internship and this sets a tone for you to build the rest of your career on. If you want to work in any programming field (or any field) you are going to have to fight through jobs and times like these to get to where you want to be. Quitting will always be an option, but seldom the right one. Focus on your long term goals and you will find it easier to deal with the short term difficulties. As Cicero put it 

I have read numerous questions that do not address this specifically. In any case, I have received an invitation to interview but not interviewed yet, attempted reasonable contact and have waited a reasonable amount of time. See comments below where I refute claims of duplication. BACKGROUND: I received a request from an internal recruiter for a phone interview and a time to do so. I responded the next day, suggesting that day was not good and opened up my availability for the next several days as well as offred up a suggested set time the day after the next. I received no response. As the suggested time approached without response, I called the recruiter and wanted to make sure I had not missed something so I could be available. He was unclear, but implied he hadn't heard from the person doing the interview, who is a technical supervisor not a hiring manager. I waited a week or so and received no response. I sent one more followup politely requesting more information either way. THE QUESTIONS ARE: In the above scenario, 1.) do I only continue to try and contact the unresponsive recruiter and 2.) should I only use email or go to phone calls with them? 3.) How long should I wait to escalate and contact the supervisor? 4.) Should I contact the supervisor by email, phone or a message with the receptionist? CLOSING NOTES: Yes, I already know to continue on in the meantime. Yes, I would still work for them after not receiving a reply. Yes, I know they hired a recruiter to schedule interviews as part of their duties so that the supervisor wouldn't have to deal with candidates. Also, the position is still listed and there is no closing date. The original invitation implied a desire to schedule the interview as soon as possible (but not urgently). I am not sure if the recent elections here in the U.S. have affected the process or not. 

Meaning; the joy of having fought through your internship will be greater than the joy of not having to go to work next week. Even if your expectations are not getting met it does not mean that the internship is useless. It is valuable to learn what you don't like and in what environments you cant work productively. This helps you later on with knowing what jobs fit you and what ones don't. Your mentor not being helpful is also a valuable lesson. Not all people can or are willing to teach others. Asking well researched question that show effort that you have tried to find the answer will help increase the chances of getting help from your mentor. Don't worry about completing all the tasks. As an intern over such a short time frame (and unpaid) it is not your responsibility, nor should it be their expectation that you complete everything on time. You need time to learn and this means you are a lot less efficient then their normal employees. Hard coding tasks are good. Even if you are only able to complete one of those hard tasks or a function in one of those tasks it will teach you something and make you proud. I remember sending my first email with PHP, it took me 3 days (and even then it was still buggy) but I am still proud to this day that I stuck to it and was able to make it work. Do not compare your work or work pace with that of your mentor. Your mentor will write better code and be about 10 to 100 times faster than you at it. This is how it is supposed to be. Don't feel bad that your code is not as good as theirs or that you cant keep up with their pace. As an intern or even a Junior Developer this is perfectly normal. You can bring it up if you feel its worth it. Your mentor might not realize that he/she is not helpful or that you find the programming tasks too hard. Just choose your wording wisely here, avoid saying "You are not helping me!". 

Finances/Tuition/Living Expenses aside, for the reasons stated above, would it be wise to delay graduating in order to work for an extra semester? Will this experience allow one to apply after graduation as a "Level I" candidate instead of "Entry Level", thereby significantly raising their salary? 

I had always planned on focusing on my studies until senior year and obtaining at least one year of work experience in my field before graduating to set me apart. Due to a number of factors, I am now ready to graduate but have not yet had employment in my field; this is due to outside matters and not inability to find work. I believe it is in my best interest to begin working before graduation, because companies may more readily hire cheaper workers and I may be allowed a more pleasant learning curve as I start out. I do not want to enter the workforce full time and be let go because I didn't judge my capabilities correctly. As a graduate I will also be competing for larger salary numbers against others who will most likely have this industry experience. 

In general, patience is a virtue. Even if the email is somewhat urgent you need to allow at least 1–2 working days for a response. People are busy and that especially counts for COOs. While a lot of people do read their work related emails over the weekend it should not be brought into account, instead you need to make effort on you part to communicate during the week. If the email is urgent you can send a read receipt with it (not recommended, but worth mentioning). This will notify you when the person confirms that they have read the email. Note that when using read receipts they can still read it and choose not to notify you. Read receipts can also be considered rude by some people. If you have not received a response within 1–2 working days then you should call the person being contacted. Sending a second email within such a short amount of time might come of as rude to some people but calling wont. Calling shows that you are serious about working with them. However, in your case I would call today (Monday). You said that you are expected to start within the next few days so even waiting one day can be too long. Take this next part with a bit of salt... Technically if your old employer already knew that you would be leaving in a few days then they should not expect you to stay longer. They may ask but they can not expect it. So if it is not completely OK with the new company you need to tell the old employer no. Update: You learned a valuable lesson. Just because previous employees where released on a short basis does not mean you will get the same treatment. When looking to switch jobs you need to first make sure until when you are contractually subjected to work before promising any date to your new employer. 

The price of rent in the area of a potential employer has increased dramatically without regard to the rest of the state and surrounding areas outside reasonable driving distance. In fact, it appears the trend will continue and I will be looking at an entirely different situation in as little as 1-2 years. Is it appropriate to mention this noticeable trend during salary negotiations, and how they dealt with this situation in order to continue competing for talent? Surely, they want to keep a happy employee that is focused on their work instead of rent. *From my initial research, there has not been an increase in salaries for this area when compared to others outside. **Assume that relocation to the area will be necessary, and commuting is not an option. UPDATE: In response to the answers bearing similarities to the answers in this question, I am not asking a company to accommodate my personal needs regardless of the market rate for the local area. I am well aware that my value is the basis for their salary offer. What I am asking about is referencing an anomalous situation which has been reported by local newspapers.
