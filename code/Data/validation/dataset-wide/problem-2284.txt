I carry 3 or 4 pairs and change them often to refresh my feet. In dry weather, I hang the spares on my pack to air, and it's very quick to wash them as you pass a stream. For short periods of rain, I'll keep a dry pair or two back to change into when the sun returns For long periods of rain I'll dry them in the evening by wringing them in my towel. If it's warm I'll just hang them up in the shelter - they may still be damp in the morning but putting them on is not particularly unpleasant and they'll dry quickly on my feet. If it's cold and I fancy warm socks in the morning, I simply wear a pair under my sleeping socks. They warm up in moments and are soon dry. This doesn't seem to damp out the down of my quilt. 

Measuring the distance of your dead reckoning leg. Ideally, you'd have done this ahead of time and noted it on your route-card. But you also need to learn how to do this in the field. Knowing how many paces you need to cover the distance. In good weather, you have to measure how many paces you take to cover 100 meters/yards in various ground conditions and slopes, so you can estimate how many paces you will need to reach your attack point. Know how long you need to cover the distance. Counting paces is tedious, so in less critical situations it's easier to estimate distance by time. Again, in good weather you have to experiment till you know your timings over different conditions. 

In addition to the other excellent answers, you should be aware of the dangers of the infamous Scottish midge. Before I destroy the Scottish tourist industry, in most places and seasons midges are absent or a minor irritation. But in the wrong place and time they can be horrendous. Know your enemy, and go prepared with sufficient protective clothing and repellent. I have twice seen people who needed medical treatment for toxic shock when they underestimated the seriousness of a midge attack. Once on Skye I woke to find that my green tent had turned brown - the entire surface was covered in a seething mass of midges. This is the reality of a midge attack 

This includes a specialist bivy tent or shaped tarp with nest (around a kilo), a winter-grade sleeping mat, inflatable pillow, autumn-weight quilt with lightweight down suit, ice cleats, camp sandals, a Kindle, MP3 player, smartphone, PLB, camera, and battery pack or solar charger. So I'm hardly slumming it. This requires 15-20 liters of pack room depending on how much I compress my down. Modern equipment really does make a huge difference! Achieving these weights just takes a bit of experience and a reasonable budget to buy the best specialist equipment. What about food and water? If you're a medium sized guy on a tough walk you'll be burning 5000-6000 calories a day. On short trips you can undereat, but on longer trips you should be budgeting around 1 kilo per day for food. This assumes that you're selecting foods with a high calorie to weight ratio. These days I go stoveless. This would be a step too far for most but I like the simplicity, and it saves on weight and the hassle of finding fuel on the trail. Where are the areas you shouldn't be cutting corners? I have a very strong recommendation here. If your pack weight is going to exceed 10kilos or so, don't go for an unstructured pack to save weight. Over a long day, a good carrying lightweight pack beats a super-minimal pack every time. Personally I use Aarn packs, a little known New Zealand company that have re-thought pack ergonomics from the ground up. It's the best balanced and most stable pack I've used, and only weighs 1.5 kilos for 50 litres. You wouldn't believe how much difference this pack makes as the miles rack up. 

For the 40k sheets you won't have a romer on your compass, but they do sell one for Â£1. When you're trying to navigate the valleys though farms and fields the 1:40k can lack detail vs 1:25k mapping. They're not so clear about the access status of the land. They don't show as many ancient monuments. They don't show pubs! (Don't they understand their market??) 

Iridium Sims Iridium currently offer a very basic entry-level Emergency Plan for $25 a month, which suggests that you will not get any emergency facilities without an active plan. You don't say what your usage will be, but before you make your choice you should research the pros and cons of your three main options. PLB The PLB is, currently, one-way only as you say. But compared to your other options it generates much the strongest signal, has by far the most reliable satellite reception, and will work under heavy tree cover and in mountainous areas, deep valleys and even gorges. Recent models will automatically communicate your GPS coordinates and broadcast a homing signal to rescuers. It also has a sealed, long-life battery. And it connects directly to the COSPAS-SARSAT global rescue dispatch service. It is much the most reliable way to call in the rescue, and does not require a costly ongoing airtime plan to work. Satellite phones A quality satellite phone offers by far the best communication experience, with the choice between text and voice. But compared to the PLB, it is much more expensive to purchase and run, and it has far less reliable reception. Nor does it automatically communicate your position to rescuers. You also have to be careful to keep its battery topped up, and the regular charging/discharging cycle means that its battery life will be more limited. Messengers These are a half-way house between the phones and the PLBs. The cheap-and-cheerful Spot offers one-way text communication, and the more upmarket InReach offers 2-way texting. But compared to a PLB, reception is much less reliable, you have ongoing service charges, and you have to keep the battery topped up. Choosing a service So the best solution will depend on your priorities and budget. On a lightweight solo walk where I could only take one device it would be a PLB, as my priority would be reliable rescue. If your priority is keeping friends and family informed on a modest budget, you'd probably prefer a messenger. But be aware that rescue will be significantly less reliable. With a larger party in a serious and remote location, the ideal would be to carry both a PLB and a satellite phone. That way you can reliably call in the rescue in-extremis, but also have a good chance of being able to communicate with friends and family, with medical and rescue services, get access to weather reports, and organise logistics. Given the overall cost of such a trip, the relatively modest additional costs of this arrangement would seem like a good investment. People never think it can happen to them - but believe me - it can. 

I live by Dartmoor and walk there regularly (in fact I was up there earlier today). The moor carries a significant stock of sheep, cattle and ponies. I've heard of tests that found much of the water is quite heavily contaminated with faeces. In fact the army have used Dartmoor water for testing the effectiveness of filters. The risk is probably quite low, but significantly higher than zero. So personally I use a good modern bottle filter (known as the TravelTap in the UK, and the Sechelle in the US). It's certified as effective by many agencies, affordable, light, convenient and lasts for years. If you use a bladder, there are inline equivalents. For me it's a no-brainer - there's no significant downside that I can see. Using this filter I've spent hundreds of days on the moor with no issues. I also avoid water below the larger mines, as I've been told that there's some heavy metal contamination. As much of the place is bog, there's no lack of alternative sources! I can't see any point to a Millbank bag - the water is running over granite and there's rarely much particulate. Plus a bag costs and weighs almost as much as my filter. Boiling isn't very practical for filling up during the day and requires quite a weight of fuel. You could save yourself a lot of unnecessary faff by using a decent filter!
