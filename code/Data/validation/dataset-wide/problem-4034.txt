The proof of this statement seems to break into two really different arguments. So, I'm wondering if there is a better argument that can explain them both, or whether it's really just two theorems that happen to be easy to say at the same time. Both rely on a bit of Morse theory, namely that (assuming $p$ and $q$ are nonconjugate) we get a CW-complex for the space of paths $\Omega (M;p,q)$ from $p$ to $q$ which has one cell for each geodesic from $p$ to $q$, whose dimension is the index of the geodesic (i.e. the number of points along it that are conjugate to the starting point, with multiplicity). Case 1 ($|\pi_1(M)|<\infty$): When $\pi_1(M)=0$, applying the Serre spectral sequence to the path fibration $\Omega M \rightarrow \mathcal{P}M \rightarrow M$ shows that it would be a contradiction if we ever had $H_m(\Omega M)=0$ for all $m\geq N$. So the statement follows from cellular homology. If $0<|\pi_1(M)|<\infty$, pull back the metric on $M$ to its universal cover $\tilde{M}$, which is also compact. Choose $\tilde{p}\in \pi^{-1}(p)$ and $\tilde{q}\in \pi^{-1}(q)$. Then from what we have just said, there are an infinite number of geodesics on $\tilde{M}$ from $\tilde{p}$ to $\tilde{q}$, and these project to geodesics from $p$ to $q$. (I don't want to use the Serre spectral sequence when the base isn't simply connected, if I can help it!) Case 2 ($|\pi_1(M)|=\infty$): Note that $\pi_1(M)=\pi_0(\Omega(M))$, so any CW-decomposition of $\Omega (M)$ must have an infinite number of cells. I'm pretty sure that since my manifold is complete, in Case 2 I could also have just said "lift a representative of each element of $\pi_1$ (concatenated with some fixed path from $p$ to $q$), homotope it to a geodesic, and project back down" but I'm not positive I can do that. In any case, that still feels kind of different from the argument in Case 1, but maybe there's something here I'm just not seeing. 

I'm working with Clifford algebras, of which the first few are $C_0 = \mathbb{R}$, $C_1 = \mathbb{C}$, $C_2 = \mathbb{H}$, $C_3= \mathbb{H}^2$, $C_4 = M_{2,2}(\mathbb{H})$, $C_5= M_{4,4}(\mathbb{C})$, $C_6=M_{8,8}(\mathbb{R})$, $C_7 = M_{8,8}(\mathbb{R})^2$, $C_8 = M_{16,16}(\mathbb{R})$, etc. (The operations on the product of two algebras are componentwise.) The notes I'm working with claim without proof that the minimum dimensions of representations are 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16. (Sorry I probably could've formatted this better.) I assume that they mean faithful representations, and that they're representations as $\mathbb{R}$-algebras (and not just as rings), i.e. they're $\mathbb{R}$-linear maps $C_k \rightarrow End(V)$ (or equivalently maps $C_k \otimes_\mathbb{R} V \rightarrow V$, I think). I have no idea why these numbers are right, though. The first few I can see by ad hoc arguments, but that's not really that satisfying. I know no representation theory beyond a few definitions, so this might be really obvious and I just don't know the right theorems/arguments? 

As it turns out, any connected subgroup of a Lie group must be a Lie subgroup. See Sigurdur Helgason's book for more details. 

When talking about the Eilenberg-Maclane space $K(G,n)$, we usually restrict our attention to the situation where $G$ is abelian. In that case, we get $\Omega K(G,n)=K(G,n-1)$, so we can call $K(G,n)$ a delooping of $K(G,n-1)$. Since $\pi_n$ is always abelian for $n>1$, it only makes sense to talk about $K(G,1)=BG$ for $G$ nonabelian anyways. So there definitely shouldn't be delooping of this space, because then it would have $\pi_2=G$, which is impossible. From the previous paragraph, it seems like we should therefore be able to say that the nonabelianity of $G$ (i.e., the nontriviality of the commutator $[G,G]$) is the obstruction to delooping $BG$. But this isn't very satisfying, because I can't quite see what's going on with the actual space. All of which motivates my (slightly open-ended/up-to-interpretation) question: How should I think about delooping? Is it nothing more than thing like "for the space $X$ that we care about, it just so happens that we've got $Y$ with $\Omega Y\simeq X$", or is there a definite way to measure obstructions? In the cases where a delooping exists, is there an explicit method for its construction? 

I'm trying to compute the singular cohomology of SO(4), just as practice for using spectral sequences. I got H0=Z, H1=0, H2=Z/2Z, H3=Z⊕Z, H4=0, H5=Z/2Z, and H6=Z. Are these correct? I'm not sure if I'm reading it right, but these calculations seem to disagree with this pretty cool little note on the cohomology ring of SO(n) (check out the crazy pictures at the bottom!). Also, in the spirit of "teaching a man to fish", does anyone know of some place where people have collected all these sorts of calculations (and possibly also homology and homotopy calculations)? Lastly, how can I determine the ring structure on H*(SO(4)) from these calculations? Supposedly the isomorphism of whatever your usual cohomology is (de Rham, singular, whatever) with the cohomology of the double complex respects the ring structure, but is it really just as easy as saying that the product of a (p,q)-element with an (r,s)-element lives in (p+r,q+s) and is the thing you'd expect it to be? ADDENDUM: Since it's likely that they're incorrect, I'll lay out my process here and hopefully someone with some spare time on their hands can tell me where I went wrong. (I apologize in advance for trying to describe the spectral sequence of a double complex without any diagrams! I tried, but apparently tables don't work on Math Overflow just yet.) I'm working out of Bott & Tu. I'm using the standard fibration of SO(4) over S3 with fiber SO(3). They have Leray's theorem (15.11, at least in my very old edition) giving that, since the base is simply-connected, E2p,q=Hp(S3,Hq(SO(3);Z)). We know that H0(SO(3))=H3(SO(3))=Z, H2(SO(3))=Z/2Z, and Hn(SO(3))=0 otherwise. By the universal coefficient theorem, the singular cohomology of S3 with coefficients in an abelian group G is just G in dimensions 0 and 3, and 0 elsewhere. So I've got E2 only nonzero in columns 0 and 3, where it's Z, 0, Z/2Z, Z, 0, 0, 0... This is in fact E∞, since the only potentially nonzero map from here on out is from the (0,2) entry to the (3,0) entry, but this has to be a homomorphism from Z/2Z to Z, which is necessarily zero. Summing along the diagonals yields the results I gave above. 

This observation has now been codified (in the $\infty$-categorical setting) in section 3 here: $URL$ 

In teaching calculus, I found a great example of this phenomenon: differentiation. For instance, consider the function $f(x) = x^x$ (for $x \in (0,\infty)$). I have no idea how to evaluate the limit $$ f'(2) := \underset{x \to 2}{\lim} \frac{ x^x - 4}{x-2} $$ directly. But you can use logarithmic differentiation to find that $f'(x) = x^x (1+\ln x)$, which implies that $$f'(2) = 4(1 + \ln 2)~. $$ So it's easier to compute $f'(x)$ and then specialize to $x=2$ than it is to compute $f'(2)$ directly. I think this is essentially true for all functions, that it's easier to find the function $f'(x)$ than it is to directly compute a given value $f'(a)$. 

I was trying to figure out why this last statement is true, and at first I wanted to apply cohomotopy to a hypothetical equivalence $H\mathbb{Z} \vee F \simeq S^0$, but then I realized that of course there's no reason that we should have such an equivalence. Is there some other easy approach? 

I've heard a little recently about equivariant homotopy theory, and so I decided to try out some baby examples just to get a feel for it. I'm not even sure if these are the right thing to look at, and I'm sure I'm butchering the notation, but I've attempted to compute $\pi_2^{C_n}(S^2)$ and $\pi_3^{C_3}(S^2)$; here, $C_n$ acts by rotations on the plane and $C_3$ acts by the standard representation on 3-space. For the first one, there's the obvious equivariant cell structure on $S^2$, which has fixed vertices at 0 and at the basepoint $\infty$, one orbit of $n$ edges, and one orbit of $n$ faces. My maps are based and I need to map fixed points to fixed points, so either both vertices go to $\infty$ or else my map fixes them. 

In Chern-Weil theory, we choose an arbitrary connection $\nabla$ on a complex vector bundle $E\rightarrow X$, obtain its curvature $F_\nabla$, and then we get Chern classes of $E$ from the curvature form. A priori it looks like these live in $H^*(X;\mathbb{C})$, but by an argument that I don't really understand they're actually in the image of $H^*(X;\mathbb{Z})$ (which is where they're usually considered to live). Meanwhile, I've heard people say that whenever I see a arbitrary real constants that end up having to be integers I should wonder whether the Atiyah-Singer index theorem is lurking in there somewhere. Is there anything to this wild guess? 

I'm not sure your "nearness" relation is the right definition to make. It makes sense on the face of it, but for example I think you can generate the usual topology on the plane by tubular neighborhoods of half-circles. For three points x,y,z on a line in that order, I don't think you get any relationship. Using the usual disk basis you'd satisfy condition (1) for Nxyz, but you could violate condition (2) using the other basis I just suggested, if the tubular neighborhood is sufficiently small. 

I'd imagine these don't suffice themselves. I know that $w_{2n}(TM) \equiv_2 c_n(TM)$, so this holds in the universal case $H^\ast(BO_{2n};\mathbb{Z}/2) \rightarrow H^\ast(BU_n;\mathbb{Z}/2)$. And certainly there are necessary conditions like $w_1(TM)=0$ (which of course just means that $TM$ is an orientable bundle, which is the same as asking that $M$ be an orientable manifold). But I have no idea of what sufficient conditions would look like. I've heard that this problem is indeed solved. Maybe it takes some characteristic class & cohomology operation gymnastics, or maybe it even needs extraordinary characteristic classes. Or maybe there's yet another ingredient in the classification? Edit: Apparently I misquoted my source, and this is only known stably (which makes sense, in light of Joel's answer and Tom's comments on it).
