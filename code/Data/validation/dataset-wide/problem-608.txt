YES! I have had frame damage occur, but it was not from chain slap alone! As Daniel mentioned, it was on a steel steed, that led to corrosion. In fact it was on the very first bike in which I was totally smitten, a Ritchey P-23 :( Sadly, the chainstay did crack. Ritchey did repair, so all was not lost. The term ridden hard and put away wet...yep on steel frames with chain slap or any paint chips for that matter is not a good idea! Most of us keep our bikes in a garage or in basement rampant with moisture. The MIT (most important thing) is to dry your steel steed! Over the years I have seen this numerous times and just saw an old Serrota at the LBS with major rust to point where the shop was not going to do any repairs because failure was imminent. Most of my riding is in RI, along the ocean, so that may accelerate the corrosion. 

Based on this picture, it looks like it was most likely purchased at a department store. I am not sure how knowing the brand will help you decide whether or not you will get a new bike. IMO the main criteria for determining this would be function and comfort. 

Not sure about filling in hairlines, but I have used Pledge and have been very happy with the results! 

Watch the Tour de France...you'd be hard pressed to find a bike that is not carbon. Yes pros do get multiple steeds, but remember riding is their full time job. When was the last time one of us put 30-50 hours on a bike in a given week, never mind for 6-8 months! Now think about the wattage these guys put out and hopefully you are getting the idea...that carbon is a proven material. Do failures happen? Yes, but the frequency is so minimal and when it does occur it is not the instantaneous snap in half you fear. Furthermore, no multi-million dollar corporation would be able to mass produce a product that posed as serious of risk as you suggest. As far as carbon forks go, I use them on the road, as well as, cross and have never had a failure. Their ability to absorb vibration is unparalleled and I honestly cannot imagine riding a bike without one. I have a stable of bikes and all have carbon except one and that one has a suspension fork. My 29er MTB has a rigid carbon fork that replaced a ti rigid a couple years ago! Now having said that, I have been riding carbon frames on the road for 5 years and the benefits are unbelievable. I used to have a carbon mountain bike and it was phenomenal. Carbon is not the end all and be all. There are other materials that ride extremely well. Hope that helps! 

From the experts at Park Tools: Patching an Inner Tube Using a Vulcanizing Patch Kit Glue type patches require the application of a thin layer of self-vulcanizing glue on the tube before the patch is applied. To fix a flat, first locate the hole in the inner tube. If possible, re-inflate inner tube to at least twice the normal width. Inspect for air leaks by holding tube close to the sensitive skin of lips or by holding tube near your ear to hear leaks. Move the tube around its circumference. If you find one hole, keep looking for more. Inspect inside the tire for sharp objects or glass. Also inspect the rim strip in the rim. It should not have any holes around the spoke holes and should fully cover the holes If you plan to repair the inner tube, use a marking pen to mark hole. Make four marks, one to each side of hole. Do not mark close to hole, as the mark may be sanded off. 1.Locate hole marked during inspection, as described above. 2.Using fine emery cloth or sandpaper, lightly abrade area around hole. Abrade an area larger than patch size. 3.When possible, clean area with alcohol and allow it to dry completely. 4.Open glue tube and puncture seal. Apply thin coat of glue and spread evenly around hole area. Spread area of glue larger than patch size. Use a clean finger or back of patch to spread glue evenly in a thin layer. Do not apply too much glue. Glue layer should not appear "glopped" on. 5.Allow glue to dry. This may take several minutes. Test by touching only perimeter area of glue, not where patch will contact. 6.Peel patch from patch backing. Handle patch only by edges. 7.Center patch to hole and lay patch on tube. 8.Apply pressure to patch, especially at edges. 9.If possible, maintain pressure for several minutes. 10.Leave clear plastic cover on patch, do not peel up. 11.Mount tube inside tire and inflate. Also Sheldon Brown has a how to guide. 

Firstly, these suggestions are only going to make it slightly harder to ride away with your bike. I've heard the most common thefts involve grabbing the bike or bikes and slinging them into the back of a van, in which case it doesn't make much difference. But against the casual opportunist/errant kid... 

You can only accurately compare cyclists on the same course in the same conditions. Even then you'll find that some cyclists will be faster on a hilly course while others are faster on a flat course. 

Yes, this is a tricky situation. I think this section of the highway code should cover it, but is very light on details like this. I think there are two ways to interpret the situation: 1. As two T-junctions a small distance apart, with you turning left and then right. In this case it's a fairly clear cut - see rule 180. You've turned left, already on the main road and have priority over vehicles trying to join your lane, including ones turning right out of the road you're about to take. 2. As a normal crossroads, with you going straight on, the other car turning right. For case 1, from Internet discussions like this from Yahoo and this from the RAC there seems to be little consensus on this. Many say that the traffic going straight on has priority, but then add that you have to give way to traffic coming from the right (as you would on a roundabout), which seems contradictory. My opinion I think this needs official clarification, but in practice it would seem sensible to interpret it like rule 170: "watch out for pedestrians crossing a road into which you are turning. If they have started to cross they have priority, so give way". When at a give way line, all vehicles must give way to others not crossing the give way line. So if you arrived at the junction and there was no other traffic coming, of course you would start to cross. Being a bike you're usually slower than a car, so a car which later arrives opposite you at their give-way line should give way to all traffic already on the junction or the other road. Furthermore, from the look of it this is a box-junction, so the car must not proceed until its exit is clear. In the image below the green car attempting to turn right is in a very similar situation to the one you mention. 

The key difference between a hybrid and mountain bike is the geometry and the position of the rider. Hybrid bikes tend to have a steeper headtube (headangle) which gives the rider a more upright position. The disadvantages for climbing will be the riders weight would be too far back and the bike would feel as if the front wheel is lifting. Descending the rider would feel like they were hanging over the handle bars. The disadvantages of a mountain bike in the city is that it has a more aggressive riding position and can be more tiring than an upright position. If suspension can't be fixed or locked-out there is also efficiency loss with pedal bob (bike moving up and down). Tyres, drive train and suspension are interchangeable but not the frame. 

On a ride today I ran over a water run off too fast and have caused an outward bulging dent in both sides of my rim. The bulge is hardly noticeable to see or touch but I "think" I can feel it when riding. This rim is definitely on the way out as I've dinged it a couple of times now but want to ride it until I can get a new one put in the hub. I've successfully removed inward dents but want to know if there is a trick to removing outward ones? I cannot find a flat spot in the rim so hoping bending back to straight May work. 

One of the tracks I've been riding recently is testing both my skill level and my bike. The track is a combination steepness and roughness that makes it significantly different to what I've previously riden. The track is probably more suited to an AM FSR but I'm riding an XC hardtail. The frequent chain slapping and rear derailleur bouncing around has led me to question what the best gear ratio to ride is and if this will damage my drive train. Is it better to ride downhill in the larger chainring (42T) on a lower gear with a tighter chain or in the middle (32T) in a higher gear assuming the ration at the end is roughly similar? 

Coordination: When riding in a group of singles, it can be hard to stay together on a hill climb, because everyone climbs at different paces. It depends on so many factors, weight, gear ratios, preferred cadence, getting out of the saddle when it feels comfortable and so on. Being forced to climb faster or even slower than you'd like to can upset a rider's rhythm. On a tandem it's more likely that your hill-climbing rhythm will be awkward. If the captain wants to stand up, the cadence becomes more "stompy", leaving the stoker feeling they're not able to put much power in. If the stoker stands, they can end up rubbing their face on the captain's back. If they both stand, then the tandem can be hard to control unless the captain is much heavier and stronger than the stoker. Power-to-weight ratio: A tandem with two light riders feels similar in pace to a single with a heavy rider. Most heavier riders are slower on climbs. Lack of aerodynamic advantage: The Coordination factor above is more than compensated for on the flat by a tandem's aerodynamic advantage: 195% power for perhaps 120% aerodynamic drag. However, air resistance is negligible on a climb. It may be that other sources of drag are not reduced so much. For example: 

The only issue to remember is to always shift to the same gear (say, the lowest) before you remove the EX-box and ensure the shifter is in that position when you reconnect, otherwise you won't be able to get into all the gears. If, on the other hand it's a more complicated set up with a reaction arm like this: 

The short answer is "No". Intermittent fasting is not all about weight loss, although it can help with that, apparently without compromising performance. There's research showing that this approach can increase the effect of training, in particular VO2 Max, which is often of interest to cyclists. For example Adaptations to skeletal muscle with endurance exercise training in the acutely fed versus overnight-fasted state. 

Research websites like Bikepedia and Norco.com and check the original spec. You've possibly done this already and found it's of little help. Pull the cranks off and remove the BB length and diameter will be printed on it. You're looking to take it off anyway. Remove everything and measure, this will be most complicated and a last resort. 

I've done a bit of research but can't seem to find much information on how neck braces actually work to protect the neck. There are many views on whether they are actually effective in reducing serious injuries (in the same way it took a long time for ski snow board helmets to be proven). Neck Braces are a recommended safety item by the UCI for downhill events, unlike full face helmets which are mandatory, but all racers wear them. What do they protect and how do they do that? 

The visible strip sticking out from the top of the rim and inside the line is in fact the Chafer strip. This is on the tire to prevent the bead hook on the rim from cutting into the tire. The bead is the wire or in the case of folding tire such as the x'plor ush Kevlar ring on the edge of each tire. When seating the tire the bead is place inside the bead hook on the rim with a tube inside. Rims have a few different standards and many proprietary designs so do not have a consistent inner sidewall height. The tire bead when seated actually sits at the bottom of the rim rather than on the hook, so the amount of Chafer strip shown is dependent on the depth of the rim. The amount of Chafer strip showing would not be a cause of your tube exploding and there are many answers that address punctures but my thought would be something loose in the tire.
