There are several companies that make masks designed for endurance sports during the winter. Air that cold can actually cause issues with your lungs when inspired for long periods. The secret is to find a mask designed to hold the moisture you are exhaling and hold it as a way to moisten and warm the air you are taking in. Just a plain polar fleece mask can do this, but it can also hold too much moisture in too thin an area and freeze under some conditions. Another thing to try is a hood with a ruff or edging. A hood that extends beyond your face can actually create a small pocket of air that your face can keep slightly warmer. This doesn't work as well in cross winds or such, but it can help significantly. There is a reason that cold weather cultures have traditionally lined parka hoods with animal fur ruffs. The ruff extends the area of that air pocket and keeps your face significantly warmer. The second option will keep your face warmer, but won't do as much to mitigate the effect cold air has on your lungs over a period of time. UPDATE WARNING PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION BELOW!! Cold Avenger ($URL$ makes masks of the style I am talking about. I have no affiliation with the company. I do own several masks from them and believe they work. Basically its a traditional polar fleece or windstopper fleece mask with a rubber device around the nose & mouth designed to regulate airflow and retain moisture/heat. 

I have/do carry an Lezyne Allow Drive pump. I have spent a lot of time pumping fat tires in really cold temperatures and although it's not as quick, it's compact and packs well. That Lezyne floor version doesn't look too bad, but it is still a bit big to pack for my tastes. It looks like they have a specific HV hand pump out that is designed like their others. I would recommend against ANY pump with ANY plastic parts if you ever intend to ride in cold weather. I have seen far to many pumps (like the Mountain Morph) that have plastic parts get brittle in the cold and snap. Being able to pump up a tire in two minutes less doesn't mean anything if the pump breaks. I would only ever recommend pumps for cold weather that have a non-plastic screw on attachment and no plastic structural parts. 

Find what caused the flats. Take the tube out, keep it relative to the tire and find out where the hole is. Search that area of the tire or rim to find the offending object or hole. There are a great many possibilities, your rim strips could have gone bad and rotted away, leaving your nipples or spokes exposed. One of your spokes could be over tightened and sticking past the nipple. You could have a piece of glass (or other sharp object) embedded in your tires. Steel rims in and of themselves are not bad. They don't magically make flat tires any more than any other rim material. However, steel rims tend to be older, and old wheels tend to have issues (like maladjusted spokes or rotted rim strips). From you additional info, it's highly possible the beads on your tires are weak and/or the rim surface isn't providing good purchase for them. It's possible that the bead "let go" from the rim and the tube simply blew out the exposed are (much more likely at higher pressures). Generally this is accompanied with a loud bang similar to a gunshot. 

Perfect pedaling is actually on the rare side and generally takes a lot of work to develop. That being said many people pedal in an unbalanced way (I tend to have a much stronger downstroke on my right and upstroke on my left). I use clipless however, so my feet are always in the proper position (for me). If your foot position varies or isn't correct (for you) you may experience uneven pain. It's also possible you have an unbalanced stroke. Either of these could contribute to single sided pain. 

I would say it depends on your riding style and the geometry of the specific bike you are looking at. 29'r is definitely not to big for you (I am 5'10" and my 29'rs are just fine). However, there are reasons that a lot of all mountain, freeride and almost all downhill rigs are still 26". 29'rs are less suited for highly technical riding, but much better suited for cross country and trail riding. As always, tailor your bicycle choice to your riding style. If you are into flowy single track and aren't hitting drops, ripping through rock gardens and generally abusing the landscape with your rig, then 29" is probably a better choice for you (with the right size frame). 

Yes. This can be done. There are some important considerations that you should make, however, before the change. Frames are generally built with a particular amount of travel in mind. The frame geometry is "optimized" for a fork of that travel. Adding one with less or more travel can change the geometry, handling, and feel of the bike. Many rigid fork manufacturers these days make various versions of a fork meant to replace a suspension fork of specific travel and keep frame geometry the same, or as close as possible. Additionally, the fork will need to have whatever axle spacing and brake setup that you have on the current suspension fork. All of that before installation, which will generally require some specialized tools to cut the steer tube to the proper/same length and then clean up the cut. You'll possibly also need some headset parts if the old ones can't be removed from the old fork without damage. Lastly you'll need to do a headset and brake adjusts after the fork installation. All of those tasks are relatively simple, but best left to someone who has done it before, or supervised by someone who has done it before. 

The way to check is to remove the lockring and see how much of the cassette has a carrier and/or how many cogs are individual. However, the situations in which this would be beneficial are few. --You have very specific gearing needs. If you are a extremely serious rider and wish your cassette to be tailored to your power profile or something similar, replacing individual cogs may make sense. --You have a very expensive cassette and have somehow managed to damage only one cog. In this case where some freak accident has damaged one cog, but the rest of the cassette is fine, it would make sense on a high end cassette to replace one cog. Those are really the only two scenarios I can think of where such a replacement would be warranted. With proper riding cassettes wear fairly evenly and by the time any one cog is shot, you are better off replacing the whole cassette (and the chain). If you are riding badly and using one gear/cog all the time and have destroyed it, but left your other cogs magically untouched, you should probably consider less expensive components, better riding technique, a single speed or some combination of those three. Keep in mind that many of Shimano's patents are related to tooth (cog) design and ramping. Replacing a damaged individual cog with the same one on an expensive cassette may be easy (second scenario), but changing the gearing ratio on a cassette (first scenario) may cause shift gate misalignment and ultimately sacrifice shifting performance for more individualized gearing.
