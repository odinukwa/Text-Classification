What about community service hours? You could even make the punishment fit the crime in some cases. If the person is found guilty of jaywalking, make them to spend their days off as a crossing guard. If the person is found guilty of littering, make them to pick up trash on the side of a highway. And so on... This kind of alternative sentencing is already becoming a little more common in some juvenile and misdemeanor courts in the US. 

This was touched on in your horse question, but with infinite vegetation you could have near infinite livestock. Goats may provide a good solution for both keeping some land clear of grasstatoe and providing your people with a source of protein and surplus goats, cheese, and hides for trade. This may sound like a joke but in some places you can rent goats for land clearing. 

Taking inspiration from the The Dark Eye roleplaying system: Magic and iron don't mix. Prolonged exposure to iron weakens the magic ability of the exposed person. The more refined the iron, the stronger the effect, so a chunk of iron ore weakens you slightly, a modern gun with it's high durability iron drains your power. You don't have to physically touch the iron for it to affect you, you just have to be close to it, so using gloves won't prevent it from affecting you. No magic, no superpowers. The physical strength from magic disappears and the healing factor is gone, so it's very undesirable for it to happen. You can still use swords, but they have to be made from bronze or other non-iron materials. They'll be weaker, though if I remember correctly more prone to bending than breaking. Technology won't be gone at all, computers don't have a lot of iron, apart from maybe the casing. Cars are a bigger problem, but it might be possible to handwave it away by adding a bronze mesh around the motor to keep the effect of iron contained and building the rest out of aluminium alloys or people just accept the magic draining cars for the advantage of moving around faster. 

I would probably go with a religious order. Leave a sufficient offering at the temple of and your enemy simply disappears into the night. The people don't really need to know how it happens, just that it happens. The silent, chaste, and otherwise unassuming monks either are or are the contact point of the assassin's guild. In the event of a monotheistic world they could be the order of St. Swithen's, the patron saint of lost causes. Who's been known to help a person out from time to time... If you know what I mean... Being a religious order carries a certain respectablity that would help an assassin's guild maintain a "beyond reproach" place in the community. 

What does this mean for a low tech population trying to build space-worthy vehicles? It means, they are screwed. They need to contain liquid fuels, some of which need to be pressurized, within a container that is only allowed to weight about 1/8 of the total fuel mass. It is quite hard even for us today to build such light-weight structures that are still strong enough, and we have lost rockets as recent as 2015 (Falcon 9 launch failure) due to structures that did not hold up under the forces exerted on them. Low tech means, you need to include high safety margins to avoid catastrophic failure, and high safety margins mean much more fuel, and much more rocket to hold that fuel. The lower your tech level, the larger the rockets need to be. We need rockets that outweight their payloads by a factor 25, just to get some small payload into space. How big will that factor be for your low-tech people? Can you imagine your low-tech people building significantly larger rockets than the ones we build today? If not, I'd say, any space-faring society needs to be at least at our level of development in the middle of the 20th century, when we first started sending rockets into space. And all this does not even include any potential for fighting battles in space... 

You'll essentially end up with a slaver realm ruled by fear - and the fear of getting stabbed in the back. Since everyone is only out for themselves, the only voluntary cooperation will happen if both have a direct gain. However, since they are not just selfish but evil, they will stab the others in the back for their share in the gain once they've completed the mission. Long term gain becomes less valuable, because by the time you get it, you might already be dead. The only way to defend what you have is to be the strongest evil guy around - or to coerce enough evil guys into your service. Since your coerced evil guys would kill you themselves, you need other evil guys to protect you. Powerful warlords would gather bands of less powerful evil guys to serve them - or die, if they refuse. Anyone gaining too much power under him would be ruthlessly cut down. Everyone would serve him for the benefit of still being alive tomorrow, they'd essentially be slaves, even if they might be called servants, lieutenants, soldiers, warriors or something else that sounds nicer. The slaves might themselves have slaves, by whichever name, which might also have slaves, but it would always end up being service for the advantage of staying alive. Since it's a chaotic society, the leader wouldn't pass extensive rules, he'd make them up on the spot and punish anyone for breaking a rule that didn't exist five minutes earlier. However, since the warlord is not stupid, he will not kill more than necessary to maintain fear. Slaves are his currency and burning money, even if it comes in sentient form, is generally a bad idea. Good warriors will be rewarded with slaves, bad warriors or those getting too powerful will be killed and their slaves redistributed. The same holds true for any of his servants. They will try to have as many slaves as possible, so they will kill some but leave most alive. That is also the reason why the lowest levels won't fully devolve into a free for all with no survivors. Those above will always make sure that not too many below kill each other, because they'd essentially kill his own power base. Procreation is a simple matter of the powerful warlords maintaining harems of the opposite sex, maybe even breeding stalls that his best warriors can enjoy so he can breed more powerful warriors (as long as none are more powerful than him). Women will be more valuable slaves since they are necessary to increase the slave stock, they are literal money makers in a society where slaves are currency. They make sure that the warlord can become more powerful over time even without external influx of slaves. Many of those groups can exist next to each other, each being too strong or too expensive to attack, leading to uneasy truces where any sign of weakness - like losing too many combat slaves in a battle against another warlord - will lead to annihilation. If two warlords fight, the other warlords will afterwards move in and plunder what's left. Over time, it might happen that all the parallel groups will get wiped out and a single warlord remains, but after his death his direct servants might devolve into separate groups or tribes if the heir is too weak to maintain rule. The society is stable since increasing or maintaining population is central to it. Population is power, slaves are wealth. Without external influx of power, internal population growth becomes a survival aspect, it might even become an evolutionary selection trait - after physical strength. 

Having worked in a couple of diners, and other assorted restaurants, most take a large delivery about once a week. That's not saying that they would be completely depleted in a week, but rather that the most commonly sold items usually last about that long. But we're specifically talking about a diner here so lets take a look at that. In an average diner, sadly but not surprisingly, most items aren't what you would call "fresh". Apart from a few staple items like: 

I think it's entirely possible... Once a creature is at the peak of the food chain its only competitors are its fellows. As in your creature could evolve to be intelligent simply by competing with others of its own species for mates and resources. Given a significant population this sort of competition becomes inevitable. 

If the four diagonal beams are held in a 45Â° position by the support rope and each other, there will be no bending forces on the structure whatsoever, and the anchoring will be next to trivial. 

Possible story related effects: The consequence would be, that teleportation would need to be strictly rate limited to allow the body to regenerate from the damages, and to keep the cancer rate down to a tolerable level. "What, you want to go too? Sorry, you've already teleported ... times this year, I can't allow that!" No matter how well such rate limiting is enforced, it would not suffice to keep bad teleportation machines from generating too many reconstruction errors. This would easily go unnoticed, if it is not regularly controlled for. The effect would be like excessive radiation exposure, of course. Such bad machines could lead to inexplicable increases of cancer incidences among groups of people regularly using the bad machines. This would lend itself to the-corrupt-powers-that-be-hush-it-all-up story lines. It's also not unlikely that professional teleportation users would be required to wear dosimeters when teleporting as staff in nuclear plants needs to do. As I said, the "radiation" from teleportation would also affect electronic devices, especially storage devices: "Sorry, the data on your USB stick seems to be corrupt... How often did you teleport with it?" The fun part is, that active devices like laptops and cell phones could experience any kind of software error. Of course, the most likely results would either be a crash immediately after teleportation or silent data corruption on their hard drives. However, any software misbehavior could be explained that way. For example:
