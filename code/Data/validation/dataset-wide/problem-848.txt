However, since it is a radar image, I would have assumed to get a shading on all sides and grazing angles, like velvet or scanning electron microscopy. Or alternatively to have the sides facing the radar dish being shaded, and the edges being dim. For the velvety look, compare to this picture from Wikipedia: 

On midnight, right around this time of year, the Milky Way will be in the zenith. Here is an XEphem rendering for the north of finland (65th latitude) for yesterday midnight (the brown outline marks the Milky Way): 

NASA published a picture of a comet the other day. The image shows the comet being lit from above. See NASA's picture below. 

You can also see this on photographs by finnish photographer Tommy Eliassen. He has many examples of this on his website. I won't put any in here, because I guess they are copyrighted, and not free to use. This is an animated 24 hour version of the above sky map, which shows the rotation of the milkyway around the zenith: 

So, in small amounts electron-positron pairs and proton anti-proton pairs should be created by soft and hard gamma radiation respectively (or other Fermion particles). The problem here again is that this event will happen only very rarely, not significantly producing new matter. The article goes on to say that this was the method in which matter was created during the Big Bang. But only one in $10^{10}$ Fermions would have survived to form the current matter in the universe. All in all these processes will probably be not enough to form new stars. 

The SN 1572 remnant, also called Tycho's supernova remnant, is beautiful in X-ray images. It seems to be rather dim in visible light. Are there any amateur photographs of this object? How long are the exposure times needed to get a nice picture? 

They cost around 400-500 USD and are fairly small. You need to align them to the sky's north pole (using the star Polaris in Ursa Minor), and then they will rotate your camera as the earth rotates during the night. Also, you may want to start with your 50mm lens first. The greater the focal length, the higher the magnification, and also the more visible the tracking errors and misalignments of the sky tracker and camera system will be. Be prepared to spend quite some time trying to get good results! 

If you cann afford it, buy a specialized eyepiece instead. A high quality 3.5mm or 5mm eyepiece will be much better with your Newtonian. 

Their images contain visible (red or blue) wavelengths as well as infrared. All images are monochromatic, as are almost all professional astronomy photographs. You could build your own composite color image from the different channels. Here is an example image from the ESO DSS2 archive in red wavelength: 

Also double stars like epsilon Lyrae. It helps to have a foto tripod and an adaptor for the binoculars. Gives much better view when the binoculars are resting on the tripod. 

All telescopes have in common that they gather and focus light from far away objects. They use a primary opical element, such as a concave mirror or a (planar- or bi-)convex lense (or lense system), and they use an eyepiece with another lense system (for viewing) or a camera in their primary focus. A refractor telescope does not sharpen the image per se. The convex lense concentrates the light rays, not unlike a magnifying glass. To actually focus the enlarged image on your retina, you need an eyepiece, which is another bi-convex lense (in its most simple form). This will re-align the light rays after they passed through the primary focus. See this image for a visual explanation: 

It seems that primordial black holes produce anti protons, and it is implied in the linked article that they are capable of producing all kinds of other particles. So maybe even protons. Also, I guess that during natural fission or nucleues collision reactions, there may be fragments being produced that are also single protons. Cosmic rays seem to consist primarily of protons. The question is, whether these protons were produced in the big bang, or if they stem from other sources. The article states that lots of cosmic rays stem from supernovae. However, this does not answer the question if the protons were produced in the supernova from heavier elements. Since I am not an astrophysicist, I am gladly waiting for comments or other answers! Edit: I read about another mechanism on how to create electrons and protons: Two-Photon interaction. I cite the Wikipedia article: 

It depends. The Barlow is usually a cheap shortcut for avoiding to buy an expensive short focal length eyepiece. Also you need Barlows and high magnification usually only for small objects. For example the ring nebula (M57) is pretty tiny, and might benefit. Your telescope is still rather wide field, so getting high magnifications might be neccessary to view M57. The Barlow may help. Disadvantages of Barlow lenses: 

For focusing the image of a telescope, one can use a Bahtinov mask. How does this mask work, and how did Mr Bahtinov get the idea to cut such a peculiar shape? Is it possible for me to design my own focusing masks? 

Source: Wikipedia The above image also explains why the image of a refracting telescope appears upside down. You don't need (or want!) any prisms in this kind of setup. On the other hand, a reflector telescope uses a concave mirror plus an eyepiece. There are different configurations, but one of the most simple and most common ones is the Newtonian telescope: 

The aperture of your 4.5" telescope is one thing, it's also important what focal length you have. Is it a f/5 or rather a f/8? The f/8 would be suitable for viewing the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, maybe even Mars and Venus. You can also buy a good solar filter, attach it in the front of the optical tube assembly, and view the sun. But be careful with that, and inform yourself beforehand! Your eyesight might be in danger otherwise. For the Moon it is advisable to buy a neutral grey filter, because it is also very, very bright. As for the Messier objects: you can probably view the larger ones. The Ring nebula (M57) will be tough, because it is very small and faint. But open clusters, globular clusters and Andromeda's core will be possible. A few bright nebulas will also be possible, like M42 (Orion Nebula). There is a good list of all Messier objects over at Astropixels. You should try objects of magnitude 4 or better, and that have a size of more than 5 arcminutes. Otherwise they may be too dim or small to find. 

Source: Wikipedia So instead of refraction of light by a lense, we use the reflection of light on a mirror, to enlarge the image. Focusing on the retina is again done by an eyepiece in the same way as with the refracting telescope. The advantage of refracting telescopes is that there is no obstruction in the optical path inside the telescope. This is not the case with reflector telescopes. They usually have a secondary mirror in the middle of the optical paths, hence reducing light gathering performance. On the other hand, reflector telescopes are often much lighter, and cheaper to assemble. Also, very compact models of reflector telescopes can be built. Also, simple refractor telescopes will produce colourful fringes on object edges, called chromatic abberation, which is due to the glass used in the lenses. This can be compensated by multiple lenses, but this will make the refractor even heavier and more expensive. 

If you count conglomerates of galaxy style objects, the largest structure in the universe so far is the Huge Large Quasar Group. It seems to be four billion ly in size, and contains dozens of Quasars, which in turn are very active galactic nuclei. 

Note that 60 and 70mm aperture are still very small for telescopes! The aperture influences two things: 

There is one rule that is generally true for all deep sky objects (nebulae, stars, galaxies,...): Aperture matters! For solar system objects, aperture is not that important. The second most important thing is: What size are the objects you want to look at: Small objects need long focal lengths and high magnifications, large objects need short aperture for low magnifications. With 400mm you could watch objects like: 

Cosmic rays consist of both electromagnetic radiation (i.e. photons) of different frequencies (radio waves, IR, light, UV light, x-rays, gamma rays), as well as charged particles (protons, electrons, maybe even ions of light elements), and other stuff like neutrinos. The vast majority of the radiation we encounter around earth will be from the sun, because it is so very close and basically a large radiating blob. Usually with isotropic (equally in all directions) radiating sources, the radiation intensity falls of with the square of the distance. That means radiation diminishes very, very fast. Go twice as far from the sun, and you only get a fourth of the radiation. The EM radiation from UV and up (X-rays and gamma rays) is probably the most harmful. The earth's magnetic field shields us from these rays, but interplanetary travel will not have this benefit. X-rays and gamma rays may also come from supernovae and other stellar objects, which are far away, but will probably be much too faint to have an effect on astronauts. However, it can be picked up by sensitive specialized telescopes and satellites. The charged particles may be a problem to spacecrafts and electronics onboard them, but can probably be dampened by shielding in the spacecraft, as to protect the astronauts. Neutrinos are I think of no concern, since they hardly interact with other matter. As an amateur, you will have problems detecting UV and above. Mainly because we are mostly shielded from this kind of radiation by the magnetosphere and the atmosphere. You could detect particle radiation, by taking photos of northern lights, though... :) 

For long exposure pictures you need to have a motorized mount for your camera. The earth's rotation will lead to streaks otherwise. An affordable way to do this is to use a standard tripod with a star tracker on top. There is a variety of products like: 

I guess it would be influenced. Right now, our vision is already influenced by that massive blue sky above us. The human visual system corresponds to the large influx of blue light that gets scattered in the atmosphere. Having a red or a blue star would probably also have some influence, as would have a different kind of atmosphere (which is not mainly nitrogen and oxygen). The brain would probably compensate, but the rods in the eye would have a different composition. 

The magnification is created by the eyepiece. E.g. when you have a 400mm focal length telescope and use a 10mm eyepiece, you get 400mm/10mm = 40x magnification. Note: the shorter the eyepiece focal length, the more difficult it is to build. Good 5mm eyepieces can cost 100 USD and up. I personally started with a 750mm Newtonian with 150mm aperture and 25mm and 10mm eyepieces. That's a good allrounder, even though planets will appear rather small with the 10mm eyepiece. But you can later invest more money in good eyepieces, which you can re-use on better telescopes which you may buy later on. Edit: One more thing -- the telescope mount is equally important as are the eyepieces and the telescope itself. A mount that fits the telescope easily is as expensive as the optical tube assembly itself. Hence many beginners start out with a Dobson telescope, which uses a very, very simple yet sturdy mount. 

Actually, your Newtonian may run the risk of suffering from the projection method. The secondary, planar mirror in the Newtonian will be subject to heating. Although it is not in the prime focal point, the light rays are already pretty much bundled up, and this may lead to heating and ultimately to failure of the secondary mirror! With refractors, you don't have anything in the optical path up until the eyepiece, so in a sense it is more safe. However: I strongly suggest against using simple projection methods. One alternative is to use a Herschel-wedge. However, these are again not that useful on Newtonians, because they filter the light at the eyepiece end of the telescope. It is probably better to buy a solar filter which is rather inexpensive and can be fitted to any kind of telescope. Without wanting to promote any specific brand, the company Baader has a good explanation on the topic on their website. The important thing is that the filter is securely fastened to the optical tube assembly, and that there are no scratches or cuts in the filter foil. Another much more expensive method is to use a specialized solar telescope. These usually use very narrowband filters and coatings on the telescope lenses. Often they are specialized to one of the hydrogen or calcium spectral lines, showing great amount of structure in the suns atmosphere.
