Family wise, you have a problem where the patriarch views the employment of the kids as patronage not as a job. They seem to be expected to contribute what they are capable of, and get back an even share. Solving this problem is an interpersonal skills issue, and will depend on the dynamics of your family and piles of history that isn't appropriate to relay here. You can try to get the patriarch to treat their position of equal salary as a fixed thing, and compromise on bonuses/overtime/travel/etc. Or some other wya to make the higher compensation of your role be "not salary". This avoids colliding with your patriarch head-on. You can justify it using market rates or anything else, but providing an "exit" so that the fixed position the patriarch took doesn't technically change you may be able to fix your issue without insulting your father's pride or sense of fairness. 

As this is important to your boss, and your boss adjudicates your work performance, you can either accept the fact that the person determining how well you work is unhappy with what you are doing, or you can adjust. You don't have to be perfect to work; maybe just accept your boss isn't happy and deal with the consequences. One simple adjustment is to get a different job. Or you could fix the problem for your boss, without requiring your boss to spend the effort. Make it part of your daily tasks to gather everyone to be on time for that meeting. Remind them 15 minutes before that the meeting is coming, and they should do final preparation. 5 minutes before hand, gather everyone together to attend. Make your phone bug you without the easy ability to ignore to do these tasks every single day. Then sit around for the 4 minutes before the meeting begins. During this time you can talk about things that won't be covered in the meeting. This may be inefficient, but it will deliver what your boss wants. As your accuracy improves, you can shave minutes off this buffer time. At work, your boss expects you to do what your boss wants. In exchange he gives you money, your salary. Even if this isn't what you think you should do for the money, it is called wage slavery for a reason. Most of the time you are going to have the ability to use your judgement to best exercise the will of your boss and the good of the company. In this matter, your boss wants compliance. The cost I described above is 15 minutes per day "wasted" on complying with your boss's orders and ensuring the meeting starts as he wants. Your coworkers may be unhappy or not appreciate your help. If this is the case, stop it or roll it back, and just do the same for yourself, so you are always ready to go at the start of your meeting. 

You have a job where you are underpaid. As part of this job, you are also expected to be able to "buy in" to the business at some future date. This "buy in" option may be at lower than market rates, so may have some value. In addition, as a future executive, how the company works right now is something of a concern. It has another employee whose performance is not matching their salary who also has "buy in" options. Another problem is that your company has a policy to pay both positions the same money. For your salary, the first question you should ask is if you have leverage. Is your compensation low enough that you can walk and get a better deal? Your pay is low; does the opportunity to buy-in later make up for it? The second question is, do they have leverage? You can simply state you are no longer able to travel because of family demands. If you are that great a deal, will they be able to coerce you? Similarly, you can ramp down any overtime and only commit to more reasonable deadlines with lots of padding in case things don't go as planned, reducing your stress. If they state they need you to get things done as fast and travel just as much, but cannot increase your base salary, state under what terms you would be willing to continue to travel and what terms you are wiling to do overtime. Then when giving estimates for tasks, give the slow and steady rate and how much time you can cut off that with how much overtime. Without changing your base salary, this can permit higher compensation. This can be used to get around the policy that your two salaries are the same. The separate problem is that your coworker isn't earning their keep. You can manage upwards and find a way to move more tasks over to this coworker that are harder and more solid in result. Rigorous QA is an important, hard and tedious task that someone with lots of free time could study up on, for example. You have resources being wasted on someone under-performing that you cannot fire; there are ways to solve this that don't involve firing the person in question. If you are going to be an executive for your business, learning how to get more out of under-performing workers is important. Simply firing them is easier, but replacing them is a pain that can be avoided if you can just up their productivity. View the underperforming colleague as an opportunity to up your management chops. Finally, note that your coworker seems to be in a supervisory role. One thing that managers value highly is supervision; they do that, and they like valuing what they do highly, and people supervising for them makes their lives easier. Your execution role may not be valued as highly as it is possible the head of the company doesn't know what it involves. Alternatively, you may have the same problem; viewing your task as harder because you are familiar with it, while discounting the difficulties of supervision. 

The problem here is not with the standard or your action. The problem is with your tool chain. Code merge/conflict tools that don't deal well with mass whitespace changes. Attribution tools that tell you what was the reason a line of code was modified that don't deal well with whitespace changes. Between the two, the cost of the change is much larger than the benefit. If you want to make that kind of change, you should look at the cost to benefit ratio. And as it is not just you bearing the costs, the most reliable way would be to find a way to fix the tooling. Fixing the tooling could be extremely hard. Changing source control providers or IDE integration tools or merge tools requires a lot of care and attention. Simply saying "I don't care about merge conflicts or annotation" is not being useful. Rules are not to be followed blindly. Clearly on your team those coding standard rules apply to newly created code, not something you should use to sweep existing code. If and only if you can find a way to sweep the existing code without costing annotation or causing merge conflict headaches would your action be clearly great. 

Proactively checking that employees are paid a wage commesurate with their worth to the company has significant short-term costs for a company. Every dollar they pay you is a dollar less profit. It is very, very seductive to freeze wages and only give raises when there is a squeeky wheel. This can generate significant short-term return on lack of investment. Measuring employee dissatisfaction is hard, and measuring the impact on the business is just as hard. Things that are hard to measure are neglected in a culture that seeks to use objective metrics to make decisions. Imagine trying to sell "I want to spend X more dollars a year on this. No, I cannot give you a business case other than a vague one. No, I cannot directly show a connection to the business's bottom line." It is a hard sell. Meanwhile, "I kept costs down" is an easy sell. And in a low-inflation environment, a zero salary increase doesn't feel as bad as a the few-percent cut it actaually is. The harm from failing to "properly" compensate workers is that they move on. Institutional knowledge decays at a faster rate. Churn increases. The cost of hiring qualified applicants goes up. But all of these costs are longer term than "an extra X thousand dollars in salary" next year, and they often come out of someone else's budget. And the opposite, where you give everyone generous raises every year, can lead to a bloated cost structure and a morbund business. If you don't feel comfortable advocating for your own raises and promotions and recognition, find a business where they don't require that kind of advocation. Where there are salary bands and clear non-objective non-schmooze based promotion tracks. Some large companies, union shops, and governments offer these kind of environment. There, keeping your head down and doing good work, learning what is required to gain recognition and promotion according to some objective criteria, and generally not self-promoting can work. There are negatives to every work place culture. Find a work place culture that works with your preferences. 

Your issue is your envy. Now, your envy is not your companies problem; it is your family's problem. So an answer to this has to be broken into two parts. The family problem, and the workspace problem. First, I'll pretend there is no family involved, which can illuminate the situation. 

Your boss considers failure to follow his request -- be on time for this daily meeting -- to be a challenge to his authority. Your boss appears to consider status and deference to be important. By being late and not working hard to obey his request, you are not being deferent. Your "solution" may get people to show up at the time the boss wants, but it doesn't solve the deference problem. You are asking your boss to micro-manage and coddle underlings to get them to do what the boss says. What more, certain tasks are interrupt and/or schedule based. Others are flow based. Manging people is rarely flow based, it is usually interrupt and schedule based. To someone working on interrupt/schedule based tasks, failing to adhere to a schedule (missing or being late to a meeting) indicates that what they are doing is more important than the meeting. Their work life is full of such priortizations; they expect everyone else to be as well. Flow based work -- where you get "lost" in it, and it requires protracted concentration to be efficient -- means that if you are checking for higher priority interrupts and/or schedules, you are going to be far less effective. Your boss may not be doing much flow based work, so when you "get lost in a problem" from a schedule/interrupt based work perspective, it means "my problem was more important than the meeting I have with you". 

What you are in effect asking is if there is a reasonable, low-risk way to deal with systemic gender discrimination risk. Sorry, probably not. There are no easy ways around systemic discrimination. Stating you are aware of the problem doesn't help. Asking them to be aware of the problem doesn't help. You can look to find organizations which publically state they are aware of the issue and work to combat it. Asking about this during an interview is high risk, as the reaction of people in power to being asked about "do you oppress?" is usually very negative. You can see lots of evidence about this in this very Q&A, where people talk about being offended by the question, or treat someone who believes this is the case as someone not to hire. The upside of asking is that you will pre-filter out the workplaces where the attitude is "there is no problem". The downside is you pre-filter. As a prospective employee, there is a large power imbalance, and often you need the job more than they need to employ you specifically. Sometimes this isn't the case, and they need you more than the opposite: but modern business practices basically revolves around eliminating that possibility as much as possible. If there was an easy way around systemic discrimination, the problem would already be solved. So, rather than talk about it in the interview (or before!), examine the public statements of the company around the gender pay gap. There are employers explicitly working to eliminate it, that study their own pay gap problems and publish their successes and failures pubically. Seek out such employers. Find employers that use objective, transparent criteria (almost anything will do!) to determine salaries to avoid the negotiation trap. There are companies who will probably respond enthusiastically to being asked about their gender pay gap policies, such as McMaster University. There are many, many others which will respond with deciding not to hire you, or flagging you as a troublemaker. So, only ask a question like "what policies do you have to address gender pay gaps" or the like if you are planning to walk away if they don't give the answer you want. This can be a valid option, and it does send a message (that their lack of gender pay gap policies can cost them hires). But it sends a message at a cost, and with the power imbalance involved in interview and employment, odds are they aren't listening too hard to you. 

First, consider the law. In Canada, there are sometimes legal obligations to give notice on part of employees (with exceptions). In Alberta, the required notice period for a short term employee is 1 week. $URL$ There is also a "reasonable notice" requirement which may be on top of that. However if you have not worked there 3 months, there is a zero week notice period. The consequences of breaking such law are something you should talk to a lawyer over. However, if you do give such notice, and they do terminate you summarially, it is possible they will owe you layoff pay as large as the notice you are providing or the pay they'd owe you if they terminated you for no cause. In Alberta, this is 0 weeks if less than 3 months, but if more than 4 years this amount can be greater than the minimium notice you have to give them. However, section 56/58 states " the employee is employed under an agreement by which the employee may elect either to work or not to work for a temporary period when requested to work by the employer" it means no notice is required of either party. Are you free to turn down shifts (under your contract?); if so, neither of you have a legal obligation of notice. Again, this is something you'd want to consult a lawyer about. Examine the labor law where you work. See what your obligations are under the law. Determine if there are customary different obligations (some of which may have the force of common law). However, if your employer is both legally free to let you go with 0 notice for no cause, and your employer does this, your ethical obligations to the employer seem relatively low to give notice. If your legal obligations are also missing, and you are seriously doing this because you have tried and failed to fix the unprofessional conduct at the workplace, and practically there will be no hole in your resume to explain, and you are willing to explain honestly what was going on to someone who explicitly asks you about it in the future. But society works by being at least marginally more professional and decent than the people who you interact with. Examine the costs of being more decent to your employer than they are to you, and see if you can stomach it.
