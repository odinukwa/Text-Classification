There's a well-known expression, "you can't step into the same river twice." (perhaps attributed to Heraclitus). You may be introducing an extra confusion when you say that "a thing has changed", or that "some specific change is a permanent property of some thing": because in reality the changed thing isn't the same thing as the previous thing (see the Ship of Theseus). 

The "middle way" is the way between two extremes, one extreme being hedonism and another being asceticism. I think there's a phrase in the West, "eat to live, not live to eat". Hinduism includes a word atman which means more than just 'self': I think it means 'eternal self' or soul. Buddhism includes a word anatman i.e. 'not atman'. I like to translate that not as 'no self' but as 'no eternal self'. There are a couple of things you ought to notice about the five skandhas which you listed: 

The logic of the paradox in the OP depends on "zero multiplied by infinity equals zero" (i.e. zero-probability-per-point multiplied by infinite-points equals a paradox). You get that equation by doing a division-by-zero, "one divided by zero equals infinity" (i.e. finite-area-of-the-table divided by the size-of-a-zero-area point equals infinitely many points). But "division by zero" is an undefined operation. Using it results in well-known, trivial (grade-school level), easily recogizable algebraic fallacies, for example as shown here: Division by zero -- Fallacies It doesn't prove anything about the universe, it's pushing the numbering system until it stalls. You can divide one by n, where n is any non-zero number. 

The lead-in to the Sutta also describes the Dhamma (doctrine) as famous for being "admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end": which means that it's admirable when you start to learn it, admirable when you practice it, and still admirable when you have perfected it. 

That says that a "prime cause" isn't "evident". Conversely Buddhism encourages people to consider what is evident. I think it's a good answer. The doctrine (the "dhamma") implies that some questions don't have good answers: that the question or topic causes confusion and a tangle or thicket of views -- see The unanswered questions -- and this question (i.e. of whether or not the world is infinite) is one of them. 

For that reason a Buddhist might say, "I don't see an atman (i.e. an eternal and independent self or soul) in the skandhas, i.e. in the body or in the consciousness or in the sensations or etc." Buddhism furthermore teaches that views about "self" are a source of dukkha (which means 'suffering' and/or 'unsatisfactoriness'): views like "this is me" and "this is mine" are unastisfactory e.g. because of illness and death etc. The Dalai Lama said that he prefers to think of himself as being a human like any other; that if he thinks of himself as special, as being "the" Dalai Lama, as being "the" Nobel Prize winner, then that thinking "imprisons" him. Buddhism recommends not being 'attached' to things (because the 'Second Noble Truth' is that attachment is the cause of suffering). Becoming detached from a view of self is part of the first stage of enlightenment. 

These take the same adjective but are not the same "things". Your adding the noun "life" in your statements lets you say, "A and B are both human life, C and D are not human life", which lets you equate A and B. But notwithstanding your equation they're still not the same thing. I suspect that "a fetus is a human being" implies some type of reification. Statements like "all human lives are equal valuable and equally protected" is only more-or-less true, and in limited/specific circumstances. For example people are naturally inclined to protect their family and friends more than they protect strangers and enemies. And for example the national law (in many though not all countries) is more inclined to protect post-birth independent human life more than pre-birth non-independent human life. 

On the subject of the morality of lying and secrets, I really like the utilitarian approach, that one must search for the greatest happiness for the greatest amount of people. In your example, telling the husband about the affair could... nah. It most likely will go against that goal. At least on the short term. The wife has two choices: Keeping the secret and bearing the guilt, but keeping her husband happy and content, or telling him, which will diminish his happiness and might or might not ease her conscience. It might cause a breakup with everybody being miserable. That would suggest that keeping the secret is the moral choice. But... A relationship works best if both are happy in it. She isn't, so keeping the secret might just delay the inevitable. The husband might forgive her, and the relationship could end up stronger than before. Or the breakup, that at first made everyone miserable, allows both to find partners that are better suited, which ends up causing the greatest amount of happiness for not only two, but four people. The chances for that are marginal though. As you see, both lying and being truthful can lead to good or bad. I don't think it is immoral to keep secrets. I think it is not even immoral to lie, unless it is done with intent to harm. And, I don't think that telling the truth is by default morally right. But what do all the bad endings have in common? Weakness. The reason we lie is that we are weak. Either the liar or the belied is not able to handle the truth, or we just don't trust people to deal with the truth in a manner that aims for the greatest benefit of all involved. This weakness is the cause of lies, and the nature of the evil that we falsely deem to be within the act of lying itself. If the Bible speaks of the Father of Lies, that is how I as atheist would picture him: Our weakness, our distrust, and our lack of benevolence in the face of uncomfortable truths. 

Wouldn't the simulation hypothesis erase the concept of guilt altogether? If none of us are real, including the people around one and including oneself, doesn't any kind of ethic based on the value of life just disintegrate? After all, the value of simulated life is just simulated too. Consider this for a moment. Two worlds. One changed. One is still the same. For which world do we redefine our morals? The one that changed. I think that the true question is not if we should apply our morals to video games, but why we should not apply the morals used in video games to a simulated reality. Well, basically it's the same question from a different perspective and will yield the same answers defining boundaries of conscience, but it highlights the conclusions that are more worrysome to me than an existence that at least technically ceases whenever I turn off the device. I say technically, because many of them, you couldn't kill without erasing my memory. They only ever truly existed in the perception of the player, or reader, not in the machine you turn off and on without consequence (if you saved, that is). They are basically immortal in my mind, as long as I remember their "lives". Many others, I never even recognized as more than a target in the first place. You wouldn't want to be one of them. They are not just dead, but erased from all forms of existence. We already developed a stance on morals in games that would then apply to reality: Morals count only if you immerse yourself to the point where you feel that they do. I've destroyed billions of enemies in Galaga-style space shooters and other simple games, but tore myself up over the decision to sacrifice Kaidan or Ashley in Mass Effect. And I didn't even like either of them much. These different styles of play do not interfere with each other, I apply one I deem fitting for the game. So what is to keep someone else, who decides to play the "game" differently, from playing it the way I'd play GTA2? 

I'm reading The Principles of Non-Philosophy and re-reading Philosophy and Non-Philosophy by François Laruelle and I keep coming across this description of the philosophical decision described as a "fractional matrix in 2/3rd terms." For example he states in the first work: 

After a quick search for skepticism it seems that the term is heavily peroidized, referring to the school of Pyrrhonism in the 1st BC its subsequent rediscovery in the 17th century. So it seems there aren't really any contemporary philosophical skeptics (although in some abstracts of papers on skepticism I found Marx and Derrida came up). Its possible the term has degraded since skepticism is usually supplemented with some sort of empiricism or realism and where it isn't it typically manifests as nihilism. I've become rather hesitant to define François Laruelle's non-philosophy since I don't want to misrepresent it but I will offer it here as the most contemporary thinking through of the implications of what you called Nietzsche's philosophical skepticism (although I would define Nietzsche's project more as an anti-philosophy). One of the basic gestures of non-philosophy is to critique the notion of thought's "sufficiency" to comprehend and conceptualize reality (the "Real"). Put in overly simplistic terms, it posits that the Real is foreclosed to thought and is thus unphilosophizable. The only way it becomes philosophizable or conceptualizable is if it is "decided" which is the inaugurating gesture of all systematic philosophies. I won't go on from there but you can see how it takes up the themes of certain skeptical philosophies. The most representative work is Philosophie Non-Standard which sadly remains untranslated but The Principles of Non-Philosophy was recently translated into English and is considered the most advanced presentation of Laruelle's thought. Deleuze and Guattari are also a good place to look for philosophers taking up the style and thematics of Nietzsche (although this can be said of most of the French theory that emerged in the late 60's) but are hardly as readable. If you are feeling more poetic, I would look into E.M. Cioran. In terms of a contemporary "rigorous" empirical skepticism, there is no one better than Wittgenstein. If you want to go back to the historical manifestations of skepticism with some contemporary commentary, Richard H. Popkin looks like a good place to start (though I haven't read him myself). 

Ross Wolf (see $URL$ states that it is a reference to Hegel's "henology" and describes it in the Fichtean terms of thesis-antithesis-synthesis: "The “3” side invariably refers to the transcendentally exterior “synthesis,” while the “2” refers to the immanently interior dualism of “thesis” and “antithesis” (to use crude Fichtean terms)." However, I still want to know that the significance of Laruelle's use of a fractional matrix is. Can anyone conceptualize this or define a "fractional matrix" in either layman's terms or "philo-speak"? 

Derrida is hard to sum up but can someone define his notion of "dissemination" or does anyone know a good passage where he defines it? I know that Derrida writes on dissemination and has an original theory of it but I haven't encountered it in the "majors," namely, Of Grammatology and Writing and Difference. I've been writing on the transmission of knowledge and the reproduction of subjectivity and looking at Kant's notion of genius, disciples and the preservation and transmission of artistic technique through education and I think Derrida's perspective would be useful.
