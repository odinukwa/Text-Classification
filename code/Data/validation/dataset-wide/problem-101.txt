Yes, South Africa is an example. There, poorly armed rebels overthrew what most historians agree was a nuclear-armed state at the time. 

They would simply use Earth years. “Years” farther out in the solar system are simply too long to serve as useful units of time—Pluto’s orbital period is nearly 250 years! There is no need for people to synchronize years with physical characteristics of the celestial body they are on. I doubt anyone is using insolation to farm crops out on Mars. They would simply schedule things in terms of the old calendar. 

But how realistic is it that an alien would have the same concept of algebra as we do? Would our equations even make sense to them? Would theirs make sense to us? Would they even have “equations”? Would they have the concept of things like a variable or a square root? Would things like “subtract x from both sides” make sense to them? Note that I’m not asking about symbols—we assume that, just as our friendly space alien has learned the English alphabet, he also knows about human symbols such as , etc. He also speaks the English language well (or has a translator chip in his brain). I’m also not asking if the alien would have problems with arbitrary conventions in our mathematical system (i.e. base 10, 360° in a circle, etc), rather the underlying system of logic. I’m asking that, if our mathematical glyphs were intelligible to our alien, would he feel right at home performing algebraic operations on Earth? If our alien came from a planet with a completely foreign algebraic system, how quickly could he pick up “human” algebra? How much of his native algebra knowledge could be transferred to his new context? 

This problem can be overcome using abstract digital characters, essentially an alphabet much like ours, itemzed and encoded into codepoints similar to our own unicode. Since encoded characters abstract away the physical, sonic qualities of speech into semantic characters (‘letters’ in our language), they can be used as a universal format of communication. They are easy to learn; in fact you are reading this answer right now using abstract digital characters, all without hearing any auditory speech at all. And they are easy to transmit—we already know how to encode them into binary bits, essentially a glorified morse code, and we are quite good at this, see UTF-8 and associated technologies, which are extensible and allow for variable bit widths. Since the characters themselves are abstracted away from the physical qualities of speech, each species can develop its own way of rendering and understanding them. For humans, we use technology known as fonts to convert the characters visually into representations called glyphs which can be read on paper or on screens. For humans without sight, we instead represent these characters as raised dots known as braille. Notice that the characters and their meaning are unchanged; only the representation is different. Other species could render abstract digital characters as any combination of scents, sounds, shapes, electrical mind signals, you name it. 

Build the city upside-down, clinging to the bottom of the ice layer, but leave the gravity alone, Dynamo style. Much easier than trying to reverse gravity. Added bonus is you don't have to worry about people falling into the abyss, because of the buoyancy of the water. Some shots from Dynamo for inspiration: 

It’s an alternate 2023 (oh, 2012 is just so cliché), and Kanye West, in all his megalomania has nudged a toxic comet of death into a collision course with Earth. US Government hacks conclude that the comet will render the surface of the planet uninhabitable, and so draw up plans to build a massive national shelter somewhere in the Rockies (make it underground or perhaps an enormous transparent dome, but the catastrophe is such that it has to be a contained habitat). They expect the survivors to live there for decades. Space is extremely limited, so every non-essential inhabitant needs to be very well justified. Such an operation clearly has a staggering list of essential, indispensable, and downright mission-critical personnel to make it work, else the entire colony fails. There’s the guy that wrote the stupendously complex software that keeps the dome from exploding, the brilliant scientist who is the only one that knows how to grow the wonder crops that feed the colony, the original architect who would be really nice to have around if we ever had questions about that thingamajig that holds the structure up, and that hilarious comedian who we would all be really depressed if we didn’t have him and his heart-lifting performances to cheer us all up. All great, we have the A-team to preserve the continuity of the United States, yes? Except no one wants to come. A surprisingly large number of personnel would rather spend their last moments with family members and loved ones, rather than save themselves and live out a regimented, grueling life in a dank, musty habitat underneath Mount Yuck. The Government is now stuck with a dilemma of an Ark that is woefully understaffed, as no one wants to leave their loved ones behind! How does it come up with incentives to get people to come? Perhaps it lets people bring a certain number of friends and family members, but how do we make this into a workable policy? We wish to maximize the amount of psychological support colony members can expect to recieve on the “other side”, while minimizing dead weight on the colony. Some edge example cases to consider (humans are weird, after all): Mel Mel wrote the software that keeps the piranhas out of the colony’s water supply. The algorithms are so complicated (piranhas are surprisingly difficult to detect) that Mel is basically the only person who understands it. Mel and his wife belong to some religious sect, and they have twenty-three biological children. Dianna Dianna is a world-class civil engineer who designs the air-filtration systems for the colony. There are only a handful of people in the world who can do what Dianna does. But Dianna is gay, and she lives in Alabama, where the county clerks are really reluctant to grant her and her partner Taylor’s marriage license, even though they’ve been together for 9 years and 34 days. (Taylor insists it was 35 days since she first asked Dianna out at 11:58 PM.) No one doubts they’re a couple, but the bureaucrats in charge of the colony say they’re not “official” without the license. Shifty Steve and Lil’ Marco Shifty Steve is a one-in-a-million genetic candidate for the colony, without him the gene pool just wouldn’t be the same. Shifty Steve has no immediate family, but he makes a deal with his…er…friend, Lil’ Marco, where Steve gets all the hookers and cocaine he wants in the year preceding the comet’s arrival, as long as Steve figures out a loophole to get Lil’ Marco a spot in the colony with him. Rachael Straugnum–Alina and her boyfriend who she loves very dearly (he’s bae-goals) Rachael is an agricultural scientist who pioneered miraculous advances in crop science that might just make our colony viable for feeding thousands of people post-apocalypse. Rachael is your typical urban hipster, for her and her bae, marriage is just so you know, ughhh. That’s not to say Rachael doesn’t love her partner; much to the contrary, if something were to ever happen to bae, she would probably just sit in her habitation eating ice-cream and watching depressive post-apocalyptic Netflix, crops be dammed. Rachael and her bae suppose that, since the world is ending, they might as well go to the courthouse and get that socially constructed piece of paper, but whatever. Lieutenant Brown Lieutenant Brown is in charge of keeping the colony running smoothly, and his leadership skills are indispensable to the colony’s social and functional cohesion. Lieutenant Brown has a old Army buddy, who he’s been through hell and back with, and the two are practically brothers. The Lieutenant is a soldier, and he says he can deal with the loss of his best buddy, but we still worry it might adversely affect his performance as a post-apocalyptic leader if he knows the government intentionally left his best friend behind. Secretary Thompson Secretary Thompson is the guy in charge of the entire operation, the big kahuna. Secretary Thompson really wants to bring his favorite sugar-baby with him (in fairness, it would be quite a waste to leave dat ass behind) even though she is of zero value to the colony. Mr. and Mrs. Norman Mrs. Norman is a famous architect who designed the dome structure, and it would be really nice if we had her around to help if something ever went wrong with the dome. She has no love for her husband, Mr. Norman, and the two not-so-secretly despise one another, but if given an opportunity, Mrs. Norman will bring Mr. Norman with her for the sake of appearances, even though she knows she will probably be a lot happier letting him die in the apocalypse. @LUClDITYxo (real name: Alyssa Parkland) is a world-famous beloved Twitter comedian, and no one is better at brightening up our day than her. Economists estimate that GDP would be approximately 0.14% lower were it not for the morale boost she gives millions of American workers each day. ’s favorite mutual is a girl (real name: Meghan Stearns), and the two are practically sisters even though they met on the internet. is the famous one (though has a respectable 12.8k following), but most of her creativity actually comes from her wild online conversations with . 

Such a city would be very difficult to construct from an engineering standpoint, but not impossible. In fact if you are at the tech level to mine Europa, an upside down city should be quite feasible. If the city is domed it changes city life slightly, as it becomes safer in some ways and more dangerous in others. You would lose the benefit of water flotation, so you would once again have the risk of people falling to their deaths by falling off a sidewalk. On the other hand, the enormous volume of air inside the dome means that the dome only needs minimal support as buoyancy will naturally press it against the ice crust. It also means people don't have to worry about a crack in the window flooding their houses. You could minimize the safety issue by placing nets and other soft padding at the bottom of the dome so that a fall is no longer deadly, merely terrifying. In this case, you might even have people who jump into the abyss for fun. Or you could just forgo the bubble and make the city inside a giant box underneath the crust, basically an enormous rectangular submarine anchored to the ice layer. Then you could have the city facing upwards with gravity going down. But that would be boring.
