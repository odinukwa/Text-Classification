I've been in companies that were aquired and that did the aquiring and our clients get aquired all the time and since we usually also support the company that bought them, we see what happens with their sales staff. One of the key things I have noticed from various aquisitions is that it depends a lot on whether they are buying the company to get some sort of new type of work (where they need the employees) or if they do the same type of work already and are buying the company to get their customers (where they could care less about the employees). In the second case, your job at the bought company will almost certainly disappear in a year or less. Also certain functions like senior management and shared functions like HR and Finance will likely be merged and the buying company employees are usually but not always the ones who keep their jobs. There is opportunity in converting systems though if you are someone who has the skill set and past experience to do the data conversions. Since you would be fairly new, you won't have anyone in the org that hired you who will know your work well enough to be your supporter in determining which people will be laid off if they have a lay-off fairly quickly. So your political postion would be precarious. On the other hand, the new company might see you as someone who is not entrenched in the old way and thus more likely to adjust. Your best bet if you take the job is to start making contacts with people in the company doing the buying. Another thing to consider is to get any employment conditions in writing. The benefits still may change, but if you have an unofficial arrangement for extra time off with the manager or something else, be aware that he might not be there when you want to take the time off or unofficial benefit. 

There are some good answers already, but I want to point out one thing that is critical to your success in the work world. You need to learn not to give up when things get difficult. This is only a one month internship, you need to stick it out. Persistence is the the most critical job skill you can have for success and you want to run away instead. Don't start your career by starting a pattern of running away when things get tough. Because all jobs have times when things are tough. All lives have times when things are tough. You need to be able to learn to cope when things are less than perfect. Your mentor is not supportive? Fine most of them are not supportive. Instead of whining about it, think, "I will succeed in spite of him." The work is hard? Fine, most work worth doing is hard. Dig in and learn, take a swing at it. When you miss, get up and try again. Everyone fails sometimes; you need to become the person who gets up again and tries again. Persistence is the most critical factor for job success. More than education, more than talent, more than anything else. 

My concern about saying you left just because of a reorganization is that ALL companies reorganize. You don't want to give the impression that you are inflexible and unable to adjust to change or that you somehow believe changes should only be done if they have your specific approval first. That sort of attitude will eventually make you unemployable. It is ok to describe that you were not happy with the new role you were assigned and why. For instance, In a reorganization, you may have been changed from doing Android development to automating QA processes. If your career goals are not in the QA areas, then moving is fine. It is trickier if the reason why you want to leave is because you were assigned to work for a different boss on a new team, doing essentially the same thing. Big deal, happens all the time, I don't want to hire a special snowflake who can't handle it. In this case the old standby about wanting new challenges might serve you better than pointing out that you have difficulty getting along with people. Personally just from your wording about corrupting the company (do not under any circumstances say that in an interview!!), I suspect you are not even going to give the change a fair try. You should do that though rather than run away. I was once re-organized to work for someone I resented. He turned out to be the best boss I ever had and the one who got me the highest pay raises I ever got. It is a critical job skill to be able to adjust to change and you really should try before seeking out a new job just because the organization is different or you are assigned a new boss or new project responsibilities. 

Generally education in a specific field can substitute for a few years of experience. If they read your resume, they know that you have been working in a different field than your education. This may or may not be a plus to them. But it is their decision, not yours. Apply, try to sell what you think you bring to the table that would make you a good candidate and let them figure out if what you sent them is what they want. Depending on the positon and the hiring manager, they may well be happy to get someone with a degree and no expereince, they may be happy only with the expereince or they may actually like some combination. You don't really have way to know what is in the hiring manager's head. 

Boss management is in important work skill. The need to communicate a particular item through a face-to-face meeting can fall into three general categories: 

You have to remember that you are in competition with people who have degrees and who have possibly more extensive freelancing work than you have. You are also in competition with people who have had internships at well-respected companies. You say you have done some freelancing and some self-study, but what you need to realize is that you have to do much more than that to move ahead of your competition. You need to show success on complex business-type projects or you need to have education. Frankly from what you described, only companies who are not attracting good candidates would consider you. I suggest you return to school or get several years of successful freelancing with projects of increasing difficulty before trying for a full-time job. I've worked with a lot of developers from India and, without exception, they all had university degrees. So you may also be facing a larger cultural problem in getting hired. In the US, many devs started without a degree. It seems to be less common in your home country from my experience. 

If the outside project uses anything company-related such as databases access or servers or proprietary information, then you could be in legal trouble. This includes using company requirements. If it is company related, then they own the software (in most jurisdictions) even if they didn't ask you to do this. The most likely outcomes of such a project done unofficially are that you get fired or you make an enemy of your current boss. People in authority don't like to be embarrassed and they have to tools available to make sure that doesn't happen again. I don't know your boss, but based on the bosses I have had and worked with, I would estimate your chances of succeeding to be well under 30%. Based on the fact that he wasn't even willing to entertain the discussion of other tools, likely success rate might even be under 10%. If you are willing to take such a risk, then go for it. 

These types of things can affect your performance appraisal, so sure send it on. I always do. Don't worry about being "transparent", there is nothing inherently wrong with wanting your boss to know that someone (especially a client!) likes your work. He also might be pretty happy to be able to tell his boss that his staff is getting compliments from the clients. After all bosses get performance appraisals too and they tend to be more aware of the politics behind them. I'll point out that your boss is almost certainly copied on any negative feedback anyone has about you, so this makes sure they get a balanced picture. It really is not just bragging. 

Let me put this to you plainly. If I hired you and wanted you to start as soon as possible and you said you had to give notice and this was the first available date. That is fine if I agreed to it. If I find out later you actually took a holiday instead of working the notice you told me of, the offer would instantly be withdrawn because you are lying to me. If however, you go to me and say, I am available earlier than expected. I would rejoice and start you earlier. In no case is taking a vacation appropriate in this circumstance. 

There is not a thing wrong with what you did. Your boss is behaving like a spoiled child. Any manager should expect that any employee could leave at any moment. From the perspective of some managers, there is never a good time for someone to leave. It is either too close to the beginning of the project or too close to the end or we are at a critical step, etc. Ignore this. You are not property and you are allowed to make your own career choices. What you do until you leave is the best possible job. Stay professional even if the manager is not doing so. Document what you are doing so someone one else can pick it up, do any knowledge transfer they want you to do and let any antagonism on the part of the boss run over you like water. Don't respond in kind. When he gets angry, remind yourself that it is his personal problem and has nothing to do with you. It is also natural that they will start to give the better tasks to peopel who are staying. This is particularly true when you have a long notice period as is common in some countries. Why should they give the more career enhancing things to someone who is leaving and who might not even finish before leaving? It is a big risk for them. So it's OK if they do that. Anyway, you are going for an MBA, so likely you won't be doing this type of work again. So accept graciously the less important assignments. 

As I age I have gotten less upset about these things as they affect me less than when I was a young working woman in a mostly male environment. It is also more acceptable for me to do them and maintain a professional repuation than when I was in my twenties. So in part whether to agree to do it has more to do with how you think it will be perceived and how you think it might affect your professional repuation. Do not do this if you are a young woman in an all male environment. It will diminsh your professional reputation. However if you are an older woman in a more senior postion with a long term history of professional success, it will not hurt you to do this if you want to. In any event, if you don't want to do it, say no. Suggest someone else. I have found that among groups with all men and one woman, they want to do this stuff but only if the woman will do it. So suggest the person most enthusiastic about the idea and watch how fast the whole thing gets dropped. 

Well unreasonable is in the eye of the beholder. As long as you persist in believing the task is impossible, it will be. AS I see it, you have two choices, move to one of the competitors who has a better product or take this up as a challenge to show how really good you are. Of course the competitors may not be interested if you are shoing a poor track record at a bad place to work, so really option 2 is your best bet. So you know you can't spend money and you know that some things you want to change aren't going to change. So then you get creative. There must be nontraditonal ways to market the product. You might even be able to do an analysis to prove why you should change some things and suggest possibly changing in a small batch to see if it works. The reason why most people fail to get their suggestions implemented has more to do with how they present them to management than the actual merits of the suggestion. Management wants things defined in business terms and they want suggestions where the numbers have been crunched to show how much money they will save or additonal money they will make if the suggestion is taken. They also want to reduce risk. You need to quantify these things. Going to the boss and saying, this isn't working I want to do this instead just won't cut it. Going to the boss with the actual performance of the current vendor for the last two years and the actual performance of other vendors for similar work for other clients in a direct comparision is much more compelling. This question orginally talked about rental agents, so I'll give an example based on that. Suppose the current agent has gotten you a 30% occupancy rate. Go to other agents and ask what occupancy rates they have gotten for similar classes of property. Suppose you find one has a 45% occupancy rate and another has a 60% occupancy rate. And further the last guy takes a smaller commission. Now you have the numbers to convince the boss. To reduce risk, you might propose moving to the other agent in increments, make him prove he can get better occupancy rates by giving him the worst properties you have. Not only we he try harder to fill them to get the rest of the business, but the competition might wake up the first guy yo his potential loss of business and he may try harder. You might also talk to the boss and see if there are some things he thinks you should do that you currently are not doing.
