Here my expertise in this topic ends, and I'd hope for someone from this community to illuminate the points above. Also googling usually only points to the benefits in direct imaging. Bonus question: Would adaptive optics always help to remedy any issues that might arise? 

(c) Wikimedia commons (while this one uses data gathered from the Hipparcos satellice, roughly 100.000 stars) we see, that there are 2 main types of red stars: Giants and M-dwarves. The latter are stars on the main sqeuence (they have stable hydrogen-burning in their cores), while the giants are stars that have left the main sequence due to aging. They appear red as they bloat up to bigger radii compared to their main-sequence life which also makes them cooler, and thus redder. Betelgeuse is now one of those giants, and he's actually more massive than the sun (somewhere between 7 and 20 solar masses, according to wikipedia), so there is no contradiction with M-Dwarves also being red. Please let me know if you desire to know more details on this. 

We don't know however, to which extent those effects play a role. I'd add tomorrow some references if you're interested. There could be signs however of such activity in young stellar systems, as verious combinations or extensions of the above have been proposed to explain the radius anomaly in super-close extrasolar giant planets. 

In general, solids are made from from atoms that originate naturally in stellar nucleosynthesis, see for example the composition of our sun's atmosphere from an older paper of Asplund et al (2005): 

Now knowing how our methods and instrumentation work, we can try and debias this data. Transit measurments pose the easiest ones to do this: as for transits the detection probability is a simple geometric function of planetary alignment, radius and stellar radius one can overplot the found planets with this probability. So this is usually of not very massive interest to the planetary community. edit The probability usually is given as $\sim r_{stellar}/2 a$, with $r_{stellar}$ being the stellar radius and $a$ the planet's semi-major axis. A simple derivation is here. Discussion how everything gets more complicated when combining with RV measurments here. /edit Any instrument one uses however, will have their own quirks and biases and starspots or eclipsing binaries can lead to false positives. Petigura+ 2013, fig. 1 try to asses those effects for Kepler transits and come up with the following detection probability map. 

I guess it's a mistake in the animation. At radio wavelengths turbulence doesn't affect the measurments anymore and above 200 MHz the ionosphere doesn't play a role yet, so I guess the notion of a guide star is unnecessary here. 

You're talking about the construction of the 'Thirty Meter Telescope'. Currently the construction has been halted by the State Supreme Court of Hawaii as a reaction to the violation of native sacred land. Negotiations are going on about moving the construction site to the canary Islands, which has been deemed an acceptable alternative in the northern hemisphere, even if only barely. 

The corrected population then would be found by dividing $\rm\frac{found population}{completeness}$. Mathematical issues like dividing by zero are easily interpreted as issues stemming from the incomplete data. As where the detectability is zero, we can't know if there are 0 or 1 or 20 planets hidden in a bin. When projected on one axis or the other those corrected data-plots then result in corrected Radius- or Period occurence rates. I won't show those for the transit method, as I want to encourage to check the original reference. I show one of those plots for the radial velocity method however. From Mayor+ 2011, fig. 12 that analyse their HARPS-spectrograph data from the preceeding decade: 

Planet means usually the whole thing, as far as I'm aware. Then there are specialized terms for what you've suggested: 

(A simple, low-order model of Earth's magnetic field, from GFZ Potsdam) But no matter how it looks, it will usually be constant on lines of latitude and longitude. This in particular signifies that the field and its distortions are created somehow by the bulk mass of the planet, else the field would move relative to a surface map, in the case of Earth. So all this talk just to establish the following: We can take the shapes of the magnetic field as if they were surface shapes, and by following them determine a rate of rotation. Now the story doesn't end there. While this sounds nice in principle, to do this in practice, we would need to send a probe and do in-situ measurments of this changing magnetic landscape. But what can be done from afar, and from Earth is observe ionospheric patterns. Because the ionosphere of a planet is well, ionized gas, at super-low pressures (roughly on the order of microbar to nanobar) it is frozen-in with the magnetic field that makes the particles of the plasma gyrate. This means, the ionospheric plasma follows the magnetic landscape, now translating into a plasma landscape. This plasma landscape is then usually observable from Earth by the radio signals they emit. It is also possible to see this in the ultraviolet, if there is strong plasma activity through auroral bombardment of a planet's upper atmosphere. For your second question, that's a simple no. First of all there is no 'uppermost' layer of atmosphere, as the atmosphere is continously decreasing in density with increasing distance from the planetary body in question. What you're possibly thinking about are the upper cloud layers, as they visibly end at some height. But wind speeds are much more determined by pressure gradients created by the central star heating the planet, and the atmospheres ability to cool. There is one class of planet, however where a relation between the wind speeds at roughly 0.1 bar pressure and magnetic dynamo might exist. Those are Hot Jupiters which host atmospheres that might be sufficiently ionized for its winds to be braked down by the planetary magnetic field. Then there would exist a limiting speed, given a certain planetary field. However this is still a field of active research, but it would give you 'a' relation between the two. 

As much as this sounds a bit depressive concerning the search for rings and moons around exoplanets, we have to understand that this is due to the fact that at the moment those questions are not one of the main science drivers behind currently upcoming exoplanet missions. We're still trying to understand exoplanet populations themselves thoroughly, before moving on to the much tougher challenges of detecting the much fainter signals of moons and rings. That said, I'm convinced that the moon/ring question will some time in the future move much more into scientific focus. This is simply because, at least for gas giants, moons and rings should be 'fine-probing' theories of planet formation. This happens in the sense that when gas giants are growing, at some point they will have a subdisc of gas and dust forming inside their own Hill-sphere that will eventually do something interesting. Comparing what those subdiscs do to theories of moon and ring formation will teach us how those processes work in detail. Also +1 for Asimov because of non-professional personal bias.
