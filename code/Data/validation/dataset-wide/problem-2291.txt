The single point setup was developed to aid in very high technical levels of mixed climbing. Dual points can make it hard to keep the crampon on small rock holds. Also in certain kinds of ice, the monopoint can get a better grip. The various other setups are attempts to make a compromise between getting full grip in the ice and staying stable on rock. My ice climbing experience is 30 years out of date, but I can see the advantage of being able to tweak the front point setup for various climbs and conditions. With any luck someone with more recent experience can chime in on exactly which setups are optimal for which conditions. 

I think this is one of the biggest myths in outdoor gear. No insulation is "warm even when wet", the real difference is whether it's life threatening or just really unpleasant when wet. The useful difference is when the garment/bag is just slightly damp. (i.e. if you get somewhere dry, wring the water out of the garment and does it then provide any benefit?) The answer for synthetics is mostly yes, but IMHO that's a long way from 'warm even when wet'. Your case is a something we all learn the hard way, being dry is warm, being wet is not. Doesn't matter what gear you have; you have to get in a dry environment to allow whatever insulation value remains in a damp garment to be useful. 

For an extended trip, one of your problems will be the accumulation of moisture in your insulation. I would definitely get some kind of vapor barrier layer for your sleeping bag and at least try some vapor barrier socks. It is very important that you test your gear for a couple nights before you head out. Better to make your mistakes in the back yard than 10 miles from shelter. Insulation from the ground is also important. I would recommend using two pads for your bag if at all possible. The higher R number you can get the better. Do you have a windproof layer for your legs? IMHO, there are much better choices than wool pants these days. Wool outer garments are relatively heavy, dry slower than synthetics and don't provide much if any windproofness. If you really expect -40F, your sleeping bag is a bit on the light side, a pair of primaloft insulation pants would both help extend the range of the bag and provide useful insulation around camp. I would also want a thicker insulation layer than a single light primaloft jacket. Maybe add a vest as well, or get a warmer jacket. Also, a double layer sock system works well and you definitely want a backup pair of socks. Your feet and hands are the first to suffer in the cold and it can become impossible to do what you need to survive when your hands stop working. I can highly recommend these socks. $URL$ Put a lot of thought and care into socks/boots/gloves/mittens. One other thing to keep in mind is the historical January Thaw in NE. Constant cold is tough, but IMHO the hardest to deal with is when you get storms near the freezing point. Generally, when it's very cold you don't get much snow. But when you do get snow it will warm up enough that some kind of waterproof layer might be required. The alternative would be to simply hole up during storms and wait out the weather. Take every chance possible to dry out your gear. You don't list what you intend to use for shelter and cooking. A small snow shovel can make a huge difference in creating a comfortable winter shelter. Snow is both an insulator and building material. This book has lot's of great tips for winter camping.

Getting some basic education in avalanche hazards ( even just a simple slopemeter check ) would be advisable. 

It goes in the drier after every trip. If there is dirt on it, it gets rinsed first, but not washed. If it looks dirty after it comes out of the drier, wash it, but don't wash it until it looks dirty. 

TL;DR - It will help, but it's no magic bullet. Spray on DWR like nikwax or granger's will help the water bead up for a while when applied to knit fabrics. But the garment will still wet out with any significant rainfall, at best they will keep you from getting wet in a slight drizzle. Most of these products have specialized versions for different fabrics, nikwax has cotton-proof and versions for fleece garments, etc. I've no idea if these are just different labels or actual real differences in the formulation. The one thing to be aware of is that using these products will affect the wicking ability of any fabric you apply them to. This is not a big deal for something like a jacket or overpants, but for layers next to the skin it is likely not worth the effort. In my experience, the best use for these products is to revive the DWR of something that came with a DWR in the first place. 

All these are well and good, but "No training plan survives contact with real life". Doing something vaguely aerobic that you enjoy doing for several hours at a stretch one or two times a week is far better than the "optimal" aerobic exercise that you never do. The best training for long days in the mountains is long days in the mountains. If you can't do that for some reason, at least do long days. How much time you spend training is far more important than exactly what kind of training you do. There are adaptations your body makes that simply won't happen in any kind of one hour or less workout. Building base endurance[1] requires at least one 3+ hr effort every two weeks or so. If you can recover in a week then 1x a week is good. I would avoid intervals and intensity, since they require recovery time and limit the long efforts you can do. What I would suggest is keep doing the things you enjoy, just gradually increase the length of time you do them. The one specific thing I would recommend is to spend as much time hiking with the pack, load and boots you plan to use on your trips as possible. There are lot's of small control muscles that are hard to exercise in any other way than carrying your pack. You'll also work out any pack fit issues. And well boots, there is nothing more important for a long day in the mountains than having well fitting, broken in boots. [1]- For most people running is too intense for this kind of long workout, biking, hiking or even just going for a long walk are more appropriate. 

I found this interesting article on the topic of cold weather and hydration. $URL$ In cold weather you lose significant moisture just by breathing the dry air. Even in 100% humidity ( very rare in winter) the cold air can suck moisture from your lungs since it warms up in the lungs and can then absorb more moisture. IMHO, 0.1l per hour would be the minimum to replace just the moisture lost by breathing in cold conditions. Even if you are super efficient in managing your layers to avoid excess sweating ( very difficult for most people), you will still need more to keep your hydration levels in balance. 0.1l per hour could work if you supplement it with "topping up" at meals. (i.e. when you've got the stove out and are melting water drink as much as possible. ) This matches some advice I've seen from some outdoor adventure programs. $URL$ I really feel like there is some piece missing in your friend's advice.
