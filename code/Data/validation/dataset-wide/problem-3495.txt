One thing I've seen many on here whether life style is increasing or poor's wealth is, income inequality in terms of things like food, water, healthcare keep going up, but wages aren't keeping up. This includes education sadly since if someone can't afford schooling, they can't escape poverty likely? Have countries in the past ever faced these issues and solved them? Is it possible for places like America these days? 

Please answer all three if you can. I live in Connecticut, America, and of course global trade and economies matter as we are becoming more global from technology. December 2007 the markets crashed hard and 2008-09 was the actual defined recession. Worst we ever had (not depression, recession). By GDP growth definition we did recover. BUT living in Connecticut I've seen things differently so sorry if it sounds opinionated but I'm trying to put facts together from research and forum answers. GE Headquarters is leaving CT and moving to Boston, meaning hundreds of high paid jobs leaving and the taxes are switched to everyone else yes? Our governor has been called the worst, and we only have 3 million people which is down a lot in past years. That means less business and money which is not good. Taxes are already higher than almost every other state...BUT my question is are we recovering because form what I've read the answer is yes. But if a huge job supplier is leaving and tax burdens increase, how can CT ever recover? The same for America. Unemployment is like 5% but most of these jobs at least where I am on the East Coast are part time fast food/retail jobs. Good for kids maybe, but full time employment and good pay even start at $11 or $12 an hour is better than a father supporting his family on a 20 hour a week mcdonalds fry cook. So is this really a recovery (maybe definition) but has it really gotten better? Not just here...but the rest of the world as well? All I hear is bad stuff about Europe, debt crisis, Greece. What's going on? No blame game what is going on for sure that we know? 

I wanted to know facts, thoughts and such since this article (which was big news that trended this week) popped up: $URL$ I know "History always made NEW jobs when technology advanced...I feel like it's getting so advanced the new jobs, even repairing robots, will be done by robots and that is what is different this time. When the tractor came along there were no robots just humans to fix it.. I am a writer/journalist. However, these days a pencil and paper aren't enough. To survive we must adapt so I am learning online video and podcasts as well. No need for humans to work=no jobs for humans=no way for most humans to earn money= no way for the humans to feed themselves or their families or even provide warmth. Essentials for just living and not dying in poverty. I have started learning programming again through Codeacademy and research on Google, plus old books I had from a few years ago. Working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript (taught together) and some Java too. I know having a good understanding and practice of these languages will help me and others adapting to the future, but needless to say some people have it harder than others because of health issues or where they were born into. Been reading Investopedia.com as well to learn more. The job at a factory assembling or even as a truck driver is all some people have and use to make very good livings from it. With technology advancing in things like robots, computer software and even 3D printers, how exactly will the economy NOT collapse if we keep losing jobs...while still growing in population? Will it be likely we see increases of starvation, homelessness or communism? 

My journalism professor is not an expert in finance or economics but has studied history. She is always giving us a negative lecture on the America's economy and how the rich are taking al of the wealth for themselves and letting America fall to ruins so everyone else loses everything and just is on the streets. She said this is basically what it like in Detroit and Michigan right now and that seeing how divided we are socially, she thinks we're going down just as worse as Rome. She really freaked me out. Is this true> I know it sort of opinion based but if you can just give an answer on what would likely happen in a case of economic collapse for just America, just Europe, and if the whole global economy collapsed as well. I know the rich have enough investments and saved resources to live for decades, but for people like me lower middle class, what will happen? 

For years I've seen non-stop commercials of countries in the continent of Africa showing kids who live in sewage huts, parents are dead, war gangs and criminals rule their lives. Like in Captain Philips how those Somalia pirates were forced to do what they did because of where they lived. They were forced by criminals threatening their lives. Didn't the USA make their countries dry out and collapsed like many Middle Eastern ones? My professor showed a video made in Africa showing how 1 in 3 Africans are actually middle class. They have cells, cities, even women Presidents at times. So are things than better than in the past and if so why? 

Studying the model of Krugman, 1991: the one in which good varieties are country-specific so that there is trade because in presence of increasing returns, each good is produced in only one country, I find its conclusions a bit counter-intuitive. The model states that a country will specialize in the production of the good for which it has the larger home market, the so-called home market effect. Thus, a country will the larger home market for a given good will be a net exporter of that good. Now, here is my question: let's analyze two European countries, i.e. Germany and Spain. For a given level of transportation costs, Germany will produce more varieties than Spain because it is larger (larger home market). If the EU Commission would propose the creation of a Single Market, i.e. a reduction of trade barriers, that we can interpret as transportation costs going down, will Spain accept? 

I am trying to study the effects of a policy on educational attainment of individuals (years of schooling, primary/secondary school completion, literacy). Since the policy starts in a specific year I decided to use an RDD using birth year as running variable. The problem is that my sample is made of 5 different countries in which the policy has been implemented in 5 different years. Am I able to pool the effect of the policy across countries? Because if I build a unique running variable as being 0 for each cutoff year I get individuals born in e.g. 1994 having running variable both 0, -2, +3 depending on the country of origin. How can I deal with this issue? Should I run a RD for each country alone? 

I am working in a New Keynesian context so that the Phillips curve is usually specified as follows \begin{gather} \pi_t=\beta E_t\pi_{t+1}+\kappa x_t \end{gather} where $\beta$ is the discount factor, $\kappa$ is the slope of the curve depending negatively on the degree of price stickiness in the economy and $x_t=y_t-y^N_t$, with $y^N_t$ is the natural (potential) level of output What is driving me crazy is if this curve, specified as above, still make sense when we assume prices are fully flexible. I would say no, because in a flexible price context, the output gap would be zero and the firms would optimize in a static fashion (no need of taking into account expectations of future inflation). But, I have no idea about how to "transform" the model in this direction. 

The problem is the maximization of profit of a firm that produces a differentiated good $i$ using labor $N_i$ as unique input, under the demand function of the consumers (or final goods producers) and the production function. The first three steps are computed by substituting the two constraints and the market clearing condition for goods market $Y_t=C_t$ into the objective function in order to have a free maximization problem in one unknown, $P_{it}$. The FOC for $P_{it}$ is right and the same is true for the next step, where the left hand side is positive because he has divided for $-(1-\epsilon)$, i.e. $(\epsilon-1)$ that you see at the denominator of $\epsilon$. The highlighted part is correct too: this is the derivative of the function nested in the square brackets; he added $\frac{1}{P_t}$ because he kept $\frac{P_{it}}{P_t}$ all elevated at $-\epsilon-1$, this means that $P_t^{-1}$ and $P_t$ goes away. You could also have written \begin{gather} \epsilon\frac{\frac{P_{it}^{-\epsilon-1}}{P_t^{-\epsilon}}C_t}{A_t}=\epsilon\frac{\big(\frac{P_{it}}{P_t}\big)^{-\epsilon-1}C_t}{A_t}\frac{1}{P_t} \end{gather} After the "Continue...", he just sum the two expressions in square brackets because they are exponentials with the same base and in the second step he notice that \begin{gather} \bigg[\frac{\frac{P_{it}}{P_t}^{-\epsilon}C_t}{A_t}\bigg]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}=N_t \end{gather} using again the demand for $Y_{it}$, $Y_t=C_t$ and the production function. The last step is a rearrangement of the previous one (simple algebra) and it is still the FOC for $P_{it}$. If you rearrange it as in Gali, you obtain the optimal pricing condition for the monopolistic firm in flexible price setting. 

Yes, he is referring to a movement along the demand line. If the individual purchases less than $Q_0$, than the demand line would be higher than the price for quantities for $Q_0$, this means that the individual values consumption more than its cost (its price). Graphically, you just need to show that for a quantity less than $Q_0$, the demand line is higher than the price, i.e. the individual values consumption more than its cost. 

While I was studying, I stuck into a great debate between what is called "modern macro" and Keynesian macro with a lot of interesting and actual insights. I have already read about "classical economics", I mean Smith, Ricardo and so on but I did not succeed in finding a book/paper talking about the actual debate and its roots. Can you please suggest me some references in order to better understand the evolution of economic thought in the XX century and to make my own idea about the actual debate going on? 

I was reading about the debate about income inequality and I would like to know your opinion on the matter. Basically, the positions are two: the classical one, which states that inequality is good for growth because it fosters innovation and investments and the most recent one, the one of IMF and OECD, which states that inequality causes a decrease in human capital investment among lower-income households, which prevent them to become earners or consumers in the future. I read that both are supported by empirical evidence but there is skepticism about them (e.g. Chris Giles on FT). What's your idea on the topic? Do you have any suggestion about literature/articles I can read about it?
