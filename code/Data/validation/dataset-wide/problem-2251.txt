How do I know which way is down wind? I turn so the wind is coming around me from the back and is equal on both right and left sides. I feel it in my hair, on my face, and on exposed arms and legs. If the direction is variable, use an average direction. Is there a direction it comes from more than 50% of the time? The other directions are probably close to the dominant direction or likely flip flop between two directions. If the goal is to place food so that lions, tigers, and bears (oh my!) don't traipse through my camp following the scent, then there is a wide swath of area which is "good enough". Getting the angle to within 0.001° isn't necessary. In fact, having it within 180° should be fine. Maybe even 270°. More importantly, place the food far enough away that finding the food doesn't make the camp an apparent "next target". In bear country, I find two or three minutes hiking distance (over easy terrain) is a fair compromise between remoteness and convenience of retrieving "just one more thing." 

I am a 25+ year scuba divemaster. Alas, poor fin kicking technique is very common, even among experienced scuba divers. First of all, selection of a fin which is too flexible is better than one which is too stiff (within limits). If you sometimes use a full 7 mm (1/4 inch) wet suit and other times no wet suit, you likely need two sets of fins. Same for snorkeling/swimming versus scuba. The extra bulk of wetsuit/tanks/weights/BCD is appropriately matched with longer and stiffer fins than when skinny dipping. (I am not sure if it is proper when wearing only fins to call it skinny.) It is nearly impossible to select the appropriate length and stiffness in a store (at least by a novice). Fins need to be test driven. One lap in a swimming pool is usually enough to determine a good match. Fins are designed with a variety of parameters. One of the most important is their buoyancy. If thrown into the water, do they sink or float? Sinking is good for kicking technique—especially on the surface (swimming) where density helps keep the fins in the water. If you'll be at depth (scuba), non-buoyant fins are more comfortable and easier to control—unless your swim will have elements of Cirque du Soleil. However, when removing the fins, there is a definite advantage to buoyancy so that $150 fins do not immediately tumble 700+ feet to the bottom between the Galapagos Islands (darn!). The most common fin technique inefficiency is "bicycling". The knees should not be significantly bending. This causes the fin angle to move a lot without moving through much of the water, so it provides little propulsion but a lot of wear and tear on the feet, ankles, and knees. Efficient kicking motion comes from the hips with the knees kept stiff. If done correctly, it won't be possible to rapidly kick—and that's okay. This video shows great kicking technique. Though he "dolphins" as for a monofin, but it works well with two fins, too. Notice how he moves the fins through a great distance but hardly flexes the knees. This video clip shows both frog kick and flutter kick (the latter I derogatorily call bicycling). Frog kick provides nice kicking variety because it uses an entirely different set of muscles. The flutter kick does have its use: the video demonstrates how it can be used to prevent kicking up clouds of silt and minimize coral reef damage when swimming near the bottom. By using long, patient kick cycles and keeping the ankles relaxed, stress on the ankles should be minimal. If you do feel the ankles getting sore or tired, stop, relax, and then continue with gentle large motions instead of rapid tiny kicks. 

My hard shell and puffy down shell both have hoods, but they are the only layers of mine that do. I rarely wear the down shell while in motion, unless it's extremely cold (below -15C), which basically just leaves the waterproof hard shell. To adjust for warmth in the gap between 0 and -15C I just use a toque and a scarf, and vary the type, thickness, and warmth depending on the activity and conditions. When you're camping in the cold, though, and you're no longer moving around to generate enough body heat, a down hood is a wonderful thing to have (plus the added weight of a down hood to a jacket is pretty much negligible). tl/dr You want a hood for your rain shell, but can use a toque and a scarf to regulate insulation around your head and neck without requiring a hood in your other layers, although it's pretty nice to have a hood on your puffy jacket when you're just sitting around in extreme cold. 

Mountaineering ice axes serve a few simple functions: self-arrest, belay, and T-anchor. (And occasionally cutting steps, but hopefully by the time you're doing that, you will already know what you like.) For belay and T-anchors, any length of axe is fine. For self-arrest, however, there are some factors you could consider: 

US Fisheries and Wildlife (with black and grizzly bears) suggests that bear spray is statistically more effective. A 2008 study by Smith et al included two polar bear encounters where the bears were successfully deterred with bear spray. However, in polar bear country you have other considerations, as the Nunavut visitor information says 

I live in western Oregon and frequently ski areas in the Cascades. One winter, a weather forecaster said the weather at a ski area was going to be warm and wet (mixed snow and rain) that day; another weatherperson said it was going to be very cold and dry. A rare forecast for sure. Both have excellent reputations and good forecast accuracy. Usually when one forecaster is very wrong, they all are—Mother Nature usually outsmarting them in unison. Unlike most places, the Pacific Northwest is supposed to be one of the most difficult places in the world to accurately predict weather (said several meteorology students at university). Turned out both weather forecasts were correct—simultaneously. As I skied down a major ridge, the warm and moist air to the west was blowing over the ridge and mixing with the very cold dry air on the east side. It formed a rotor (horizontal cyclone) in the lee of the ridge which formed dense fog, heavy snow, and strong wind which lasted for several hours. That day, the mountain was creating dramatically unique weather. 

Years ago I was caught in a totally unexpected and sudden blizzard/snowstorm. I started out the trip at 85–95°F (30–35°C) in August so I was totally unprepared for cold weather in the days when I owned a goose down sleeping bag only. I hastily found a reasonably wind-sheltered site, pitched the tent, and dove inside as the storm raged. An hour or two later, I felt the trickle of very cold water flowing (head to foot) through the ground-contacting portion of the sleeping bag. Turning onto one side bought perhaps 10 minutes of relative comfort. After about three repositionings, comfort was unattainable. So I got out of the bag and tent—standing naked in the fierce blizzard—and wrung out the totally soaked bag of several gallons of water (or so it seemed) and shook it vigorously to fluff it up. It was not dry, but at least it was not soaked. Getting back in the sleeping bag was heavenly: It was way warmer and I fell asleep immediately. However, soon it became soaked again and the cycle repeated throughout the night, something like once an hour. Not the greatest night's sleep. By first light (04:30) the storm disappeared and I got out to look. There was perhaps eight inches of Cascade Concrete™ (snow) with drifts of more than two feet. My tent site turned out to be a small gully which was draining maybe 50 feet (15 m) of the PCT. The temperature was chilly at about 10 °F (-12 °C) and my hands were too cold to do a decent packing job (why would anyone take gloves or mittens for summer backpacking?), so I basically stuffed tent and sleeping bag into—and onto—the pack. Though it was a three hour hike from the trailhead on the way in, it took more than seven hours to return because it was difficult following and finding the trail combined with the extra effort of walking in frequently deep snow. After considering this misadventure for decades, my advice for a soaking wet sleeping bag is: 

and waterproof them. You will notice that they need to be re-waterproofed...when they get wet. Also note: the Gore Tex membrane is inside the boot, between the outer (leather or synthetic) and the inner facing fabric. There's not much you can do to "maintain" that membrane. Mostly what you will be doing is taking care of the outer layer. Ideally you want to keep the outer layer as waterproof as possible (in addition to the waterproofness of the membrane itself) because the membrane will not breathe nearly as well if the outer is saturated with water. I have had success with Nikwax cleaning and waterproofing products. Lastly...the best way to honor a pair of boots is to 1) take good care of them and 2) eventually obliterate them in the process of doing many awesome adventures. 

Just girth hitch a double length sling around your belay loop and clip a biner to the haul loop of your pack. Hang it between your legs while you chimney, shimmy or otherwise do whatchu gotta do. When you're out of the business, pull it up and put it back on your back. No extra gear, minimal time and fuss, little chance of it getting stuck because you can actively manage it. Alternatively, if you need the leader to be free of a pack for a full pitch - you could have the second climb with the pack (using the "leader pack/second pack" paradigm...but where leader pack = no pack). Perhaps you are starting to see my personal bias toward never having to deal with the hassle of hauling a pack... 

Some references NOLS Backcountry Lightning Risk Management - 2010 10 Lightning Tips for Climbers - by Stewart Green Storms and Lightning - guidedolomiti.com As stated above, I am no authority on the subject, and welcome any criticism, corrections, and addenda to this post Illustration of the voltage difference your multiple points of contact with the ground offer the ground current (page 3 of the NOLS link): 

And finally, to emphasize the point: the biggest time saver is knowing what you don't need. The less you have to pack, the better it fits, and the faster it is to collect and review it. The second biggest time saver is knowing how to pack what you're taking in the pack you're going to use, so maybe spend some time packing it with different sets of things so that when you're packing for a trip you already know exactly how to pack the stuff you're taking, as well as that it fits and that it's not too heavy. Occasionally I will actually try different packing orders in my packs on a dead evening, just because it helps me later. 

you are also exposed to mechanical and thermal danger such as shrapnel debris due to explosive impacts and fires. 

lightning is likely to strike the highest, sharpest point from there on, it will travel on the surface in all directions. Sharper edges will therefore pose the highest risk (the magnitude dissipates faster over flat surfaces and the current quickly loses energy and can no longer "jump" through the air) therefore, ridges, buttresses, and crack systems are the next most dangerous place to be near, and you should seek to get away from them standing under roofs, arches, or cave entrances increases the likelihood the current will pass through you if it jumps from the roof to the ground, so stay away from them wet rope is an excellent conductor and can cover a large area, increasing your risk of electrocution from an impact, you should seek to spool it up as soon as possible. Also consider this when rappelling,. a nearby strike may involve a concussive force, so it's important to remain secured to prevent a fatal fall recall: the rock will be conducting, so you should seek to minimize the surface area of the the shape formed by all points of contact between your body and the ground or wall (see page 3 in the NOLS article for an explanation of minimizing the potential difference your body offers to the "circuit") metal and electronics are not likely to attract lightning strikes (unless pointy and protruding), but they will definitely lead to heat burns, so you should seek to remove them from your body (carabiners, cell phones, etc.). thunder storms are more common in the summer months in the afternoons however, mountains have their own weather systems, so you should always be aware of your local weather the entire time you're out there. 

Wash them with a product made for washing leather shoes, like Nikwax Footwear Cleaning Gel. This will remove the crud without damaging the oils in the leather. Then re-waterproof them with a product made for waterproofing leather (e.g. an aqueous wax product). Nikwax also makes some of those. I have used both the cleaner and waterproofer and been happy with them. 

You extend placements with trad draws when the line you are climbing wanders, in order to minimize rope drag. You do not always need to extend them. I climb with a mix of short sport-type draws and extendable trad draws for that reason. Sometimes you can even just clip the racking biner that the cam was hanging on already (obviously for nuts or anything not already racked on a biner, you need a draw). Sometimes you may also need to extend a placement in order to isolate the placement from rope movement (to prevent a cam from walking or a nut from rattling around in a loose placement). But don't extend pieces unnecessarily, because that wastes time. In general: practice. A lot. And if you want to be fast, practice being fast (stay safe of course). Also, get good at clipping the rope into a draw lightning fast. Practice this on the ground, with both hands, with the gate facing both left and right (there are 4 combinations of R/L hand and gate facing R/L - practice them all). Do this until it is instinctive, smooth and crazy fast. Make a game out of seeing how many clips you can get in 1 minute. Good sport climbers are often very good at this, get one to teach you (or watch youtube). And lastly: practice. A lot. 

So in summary, I find that (regardless of walking-stick usefulness) the best shaft length is the one between too long that it can impale my thighs, and too short that it can impale my abdomen. I generally measure this length as the diagonal from one shoulder to the hip bone on the opposite side, but you might find that this measurement varies for you. 

I am by no means an authority on lightning in any way. With that said, however, I have had my share of getting caught climbing in a thunderstorm, and have since tried to do some reading on the subject. The biggest hurdle to surmount here is that most lightning safety advice revolves around seeking shelter, which is often not a viable option midway up a multipitch route. Here are some points worth considering: 

the magnitude of both voltage and current in a lightning strike is absolutely massive, and at those levels anything can conduct electricity (albeit only to a certain distance). you are exposed to three main mechanisms of electricity-based injury by lightning: 

Recently a friend and I have began experimenting with the use of our beards as moisture traps while skiing and hiking in snow storms. The general idea is that the skin temperature is warm enough to melt the deepest layer of ice/snow/frost, and one should be able to sip that melted moisture through their beard, given adequate vacuum conditions created by the external snow/ice layer on the beard. It didn't work, but we were still very excited to pioneer the snow-Fremen culture.
