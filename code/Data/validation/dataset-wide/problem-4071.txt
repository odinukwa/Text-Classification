everyone, I want to ask is there any result in the literature similar to the following: Let $ X=\mathbb{P}^1\backslash \{0,1,\infty\}$, then $X$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$ denote the its generic fiber, and for any prime number $p$, $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}:= X_{\mathbb{Q}}\times Spec(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ be the base change to $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Consider the global section of log differntial form $\Omega_{X_{\mathbb{Q}}}(log(0,1,\infty))$. It has a basis $\{\frac{dz}{z},\frac{dz}{z-1}\}$ , where $z$ is the standard affine coordinate. The result is : For any global section of log 1-form $\omega=a\frac{dz}{z} + b\frac{dz}{z-1}$, with $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$, one can associate a system of representation of algebraic fundamental group. More explicitly, for any prime number $p$, such that $p\nmid a$, or $p\nmid b$, then one has a nontrivial rank two $\mathbb{Z}_p$-representation of $\pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})$, where $\pi_1^{alg}$ denote the algebraic fundamental group, that is $$ \rho_{\omega,p}: \pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})\to GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_p). $$ It has the following property: (i): the restriction of $\rho_{\omega,p}$ to the geometry $\pi_1$ is an nontrivial extension of two trivial representation, so when restricted to geometry $\pi_1$, it will never be trivial. (ii): If one has a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-point of $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, then the induced Galois represention of $Gal(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is an extension of trivial representation and Tate twist $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$. I really want to know wether there is a trivial way to realize the above association. Thank you! 

For a Brownian motion $B_t$, the evolution of the moments with $t$ obeys the simple rule: $$\mathbb{E}[|B_t|^p] = \kappa_p |t|^{p/2},$$ with $\kappa_p<\infty$. The proof only requires to remark that the random variables $\frac{B_t}{\sqrt{t}}$ are Gaussian with variance 1. I am interested to know if, more generally, the question was studied for Lévy processes. Of course, in the general case, the moments can be infinite. When they are not, do we have an estimation of the evolution of $\mathbb{E}[|X_t|^p]$ for a Lévy process $X_t$, or at least some bounds? Thank you for your attention. 

The theory of generalized stochastic processes was introduced independently in the 50's by Ito* and Gel'fand in a short paper. The latter then developed his theory more extensively in the fourth tome of his work on Generalized functions**. I am looking for the initial short paper of Gel'fand, in Russian, with the following reference: I. M. Gelfand,Generalized random processes, Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR100 (1955), no. 5, 853–856, in Russian. I couln't find it on the web. According to WorldCat, it is in the MIT, too far for me. Does anybody have another solution to obtain this historical paper? *K. Itô, Stationary random distributions, Kyoto Journal of Mathematics 28 (1954), no. 3, 209–223. **I. M. Gelfand and N. Ya. Vilenkin, Generalized functions. Vol. 4. Applications of harmonic analysis, Academic press, New York, USA, 1964. 

I am a little confused about the log structure of Witt ring and its Frobenius map. Let $k=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$, $W:=W(k)$ the Witt ring. We know that to deal with the semistable reduction, i.e. scheme over $W$ etale locally of the form $X=Spec(W[x_1,\cdots, x_d]/(x_1\cdots x_d-p))$, if we want to say that $X$ is log smooth over $W$, we need the following log structure $(Spec(W),M,\alpha)$, $\alpha : M=W\setminus\{0\}\hookrightarrow W$. However, we know that $W$ has the Frobenius map $\sigma$, the corresponding map on the monoid $M$ is the restrction of $\sigma$ on $W\setminus \{0\}$. If we consider the closed point of $Spec(W)$, such that $(Spec(k),N, \beta)\hookrightarrow (Spec(W),M,\alpha)$ is exact closed immersion, then the log structure $N$, is the following $N=(k\setminus\{0\})\oplus \mathbb{N}$, and $\beta: N\to k$, is defined as follows; $(b,0) \to b$ and $(b,n)\to 0$, for $n>0$, $b\in k\setminus\{0\}$. We then see that the Frobenius map $\sigma$ induced a map on $(Spec(k),N, \beta)$, which on the underying scheme is just the usual power $p$ map on $k$. But the map on the monoid is the direct sum of power $p$ map and identity map , i.e. $N\to N$, $(b,n)\to (b^p,n)$, which is different from the absolute Frobenius map. Because we know that for any log scheme $(Y,L)$, the absolute Frobenius map on the monid $L$ is just the power $p$ map, i.e. $l\to p\cdot l$. On the other hand , when deal with absoulte (relative )Frobenius map, people ususally consider the trivial log structure on $W$ and $k$. So does it means that one can not deal with semistable reduction and Frobenius at the same time ? For example, if one want to generalized the calssical Cartier Descend theorem over smooth curve (which said that a vector bundle with connection is come from Frobenius pull back iff its $p$- curvature vanishing ) to node curves, one will have problem? 

For infinitely divisible random variables, Blumenthal and Getoor introduced in [1] an index that allow to study for instance the local Hölder regularity of Lévy processes. For a symmetric infinitely divisible random variable $X$ with characteristic exponent $\psi$ and Lévy measure $\nu$, we have in particular \begin{align} \beta &= \inf \{ p>0; \frac{\psi(t)}{\lvert t \rvert^p} \underset{\lvert t \rvert \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0 \} \\ &= \inf \{ \alpha >0 ; \int_{|x|< 1} |x|^\alpha \nu (\mathrm{d}x) <\infty\}. \end{align} Knowing the Lévy measure, it is in general straightforward to find $\beta$. However, for some infinitely divisible laws, the Lévy measure does not seem to be known. Typically, for the best of my knowledge, this is the case for the student $t$-distribution $$p_v(x) \propto (1+x^2)^{-\frac{v+1}{2}}, $$ which is shown to be infinitely divisible (cf. [2]). Is the Blumenthal-Getoor index of $p_v$ known? [1] R. M. Blumenthal and R. K. Getoor, Sample functions of stochastic processes with stationary independent increments, J. Math. Mech. 10 (1961), pp. 493–516 [2] M.E.H. Ismail, Bessel functions and the infinitely divisibility of the Student $t$-distribution, The Annals of Probability, Vol. 5, N. 4 (Aug. 1977), pp. 582-585 

We assume that $t'>>t$ and want to prove that $d(\xi (t), \eta (t') )= d(\eta (t'), p) - cos (\alpha ) t + o(t)$. Here $o(t) /t \to 0$ and $\alpha$ is the "usual Euclidean " angle between $\xi$ and $\eta$. 

The statement about the uniform "smoothness" of geodesics, show that it suffices to prove the claim in the case, when $\eta$ and $\xi$ are geodesics (since the "usual" angles between $\eta$ and any geodesic between $\eta (t')$ and $p$ goes to $0$). Going on the geodesic $\eta$ first to the point $\eta (rt)$, with large, but fixed $r$, and then to $\xi (t)$, one obtains the right upper bound for $d (\eta (t'),p)$. In a "general" metric space it would be now difficult to obtain the right lower bound of $d(\eta (t'),p)$. One could do it, if one knew that the geodesic $\eta$ was extendible beyond $p$. Then one could use a traingle inequality and the distance from $\xi (t)$ and $\eta (-rt)$. I hope I understood your question correctly and this was what you had in mind. Here one can use another trick to obtain a lower bound. Observe namely, that from the "smoothness" of geodesics the "usual" angle between $\xi$ and any geodesic from $\eta (t') $ to $\xi (t)$ is very close to $\alpha$ (goes to $\alpha$ , with $t' \to 0$). Now we just look at the triangle $\xi (t),p, \eta (t')$ from $\xi (t)$ and not from $p$. The inequality obtained in point 3. above gives us the right upper bound of $d(\eta (t'),p)$. 

Let $\rho : G\to \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ be a crystalline representation of $G=\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$. For any non zero element $a\in \mathbb{Z}_p^n$ , it spans a rank one $\mathbb{Z}_p$-submodule $L_a$. Now consider the subgroup $H$ of $G$, $H=\{g\in G| g(L_a)\subset L_a\}$. Does $H$ have finite index in $G$, i.e .$[G:H]< \infty$? 

F.Kato has a statement said that a log smooth curve $f:(X, M,\alpha)\to (k,N,\beta)$ where $k$ is an algebraic closed field and $N$ is some fine log structure on $k$, is equvalent to pointed node curve in a paper "Log sooth deformation and moduli of log smooth curves". I am quite confused with the log structure $N$ on k, when one associate a log smooth curve to a pointed node curve. Let's consider the following example, $X$ has only one double point $x$, and only one marked point $s$, and $x\neq s$. Let $A=k[t_1, t_2]/(t_1t_2)$, $U=Spec (A)$ be an etale neighborhood of $x$ , with $x= (0,0)$, we see that the log structure over $U$ is defined by the following $\alpha:M_U:=k^*\oplus N^2 \to A $ by $\alpha(k_1,n_1,n_2)= k_1t_1^{n_1}t_2^{n_2}$, and the log structure $N:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ and the map $\beta:N\to k $ defined by $\beta(k_1,0)=k_1$, and $\beta(k_1,n)=0$ for $n>0$. The map $f$ on the monoid is defined by the following $f^0:N\to M_U$, $f^0(k_1,n)=(k_1,n,n)$. On the other hand Let $B=k[T]$ , $V=Spec(B)$, be an etale neighborhood of $s$, with $s=(0)$. Then the log structure on V is $M_V:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ with $\alpha(k_1,n)=k_1T^n$. Now F. Kato claimed one extend $M_U$, $M_V$ to $X$, and define $M:=M_U\oplus_{\mathcal{O}^{\times}_{X}} M_V$, then $(X, M, \alpha)$ is log smooth over $(k, N, \beta)$. My question is how to define the map $f^0 : N\to M$ on the monoid? Over $U$, it is already given above. But what about over V, it seem that it is impossible to define such a map, for one need to satisfy the following relation: $ \alpha\circ f^0= i\circ \beta$, where $i: k\to k[T]$ is the natural map. And one fine that $\alpha\circ f^0(k_1, n)=i(0)=0 $ for $n>0$, however $0\notin Imge( \alpha)$, so it is impossible to define $f^0$. 

Let $S(\mathbb{N})$ be the space of rapidly decreasing sequences and $S'(\mathbb{N})$ its topological dual, the space of sequences bounded by a polynomial. For $m\in \mathbb{Z}$, we also define $\ell_2^m (\mathbb{N})$ as Hilbert spaces of sequences such that $(u_n (n+1)^m)_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \in \ell_2 (\mathbb{N})$. It is known than $S(\mathbb{N})$ is the projective limit of the spaces $\ell_2^m (\mathbb{N})$. As such, $S(\mathbb{N})$ is a Frechet space with a nuclear topology. Its dual $S'(\mathbb{N})$ is hence the inductive limit of the spaces $(\ell_2^m)' (\mathbb{N}) = \ell_2^{-m} (\mathbb{N})$. So: Fact 1: $S'(\mathbb{N})$ has a natural complete nuclear topology defined as a countable inductive limit of Hilbert spaces. It is also known that any complete nuclear space is isomorphic with the projective limit of a suitable family of Hilbert spaces. See for instance Corollary 3, Section 7.2 of Topological Vector Spaces. Fact 2: $S'(\mathbb{N})$ has an abstract complete nuclear topology as a projective limit of Hilbert spaces. Question: Is it possible to describe the topology of $S'(\mathbb{N})$ as a countable projective limit of Hilbert spaces $H_m$, meaning that $S'(\mathbb{N}) =\bigcap_{m\in \mathbb{N}} H_m$, such that the $H_m$ are described as sequence spaces (bigger than $S'(\mathbb{N})$ of course)? 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. For an ample divisor H, we can define the slop of vector bundle with respect to $H$, then we can define stablilty of vector bundle with respect to $H$. However it might be possible that an $H$-stable vector bundle is no longer stable with respect to another ample divisor $H'$. On the other hand the famous theory of Uhlenbeck-Yau about irreducible representation and stable bundle implies that if a vector bundle has trivial Chern classes, then its stablility does not depend on the ample divisor. I wonder is there a direct proof of this fact without using Uhlenbeck-Yau thoery? A natural question to ask : does the statement hold in charateristic p case ( one may need some condition like algebraic closed field, the variety has $W_2$-lifting, etc.)? 

Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface, Hitchin-Simpson correspondence over $X$ says that irreducible representations of $\pi_1(X)$ one-to-one correspondend to stable Higgs bundles with vanishing Chern clssess over $X$. Now suppose we fix a representation $\rho$ of $\pi_1(X)$, then it corressponds to a stable Higgs bundle $(E,\theta)$ over $X$. Fix the underlying differential surface of $X$, but change the complex structure and obtain a new Riemann surface $X'$. Still by the Hitchin-Simpson correspondence over $X'$, the irredubible representation $\rho$ corresponds to a new Higgs bundle $(E',\theta')$ on $X'$. My Question is how describe the change $(E,\theta)\to (E',\theta')$ by the change $X\to X'$. For example we may just assume $E= L\oplus L^{-1}$, and $\theta: L\cong L^{-1}\otimes \Omega_{X}$, where $L^2= \Omega_X$. Then what is $(E',\theta')$? 

Consider the family of Besov spaces $B_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{R})$ with $0<p,q \leq \infty$ and $s \in \mathbb{R}$. Is there a natural way to define spaces of generalized functions $f(t,x) \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^2)$ such that, for any test function $\varphi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$, we have $$ \langle f(t,\cdot), \varphi(t) \rangle \in B_{p_1,q_1}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}) \quad \text{ and } \quad \langle f(\cdot , x), \varphi(x) \rangle \in B_{p_2,q_2}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}) ?$$ That is, $f$ has a given Besov regularity with respect to the first coordinate, and another one with respect to the second coordinate? I am interested by a family of function spaces with nice structure, that has similar properties than the Besov spaces: (quasi-)Banach structure, characterization using wavelet bases, etc. This question is motivated by analysis of solutions of PDEs where space $x$ and time $t$ should be treated somehow separately. 

Consider the Sobolev spaces with $p=2$, defined for $s \in \mathbb{R}$ as \begin{equation} W^{s} = \left\{ u \in \mathcal{S}', \ (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{{s}/{2}} \widehat{u} \in L_2 \right\}. \end{equation} It is a Hilbert space for the norm $\lVert u \rVert_{W^s} = \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}} (1 + \lvert \xi \rvert^2)^s \lvert \widehat{u} (\xi) \rvert^2 \mathrm{d} \xi \right)^{1/2}$. The weighted Sobolev space $W^{s,r}$ is now defined for $s,r \in \mathbb{R}$ as \begin{equation} W^{s,r} = \left\{ u \in \mathcal{S}', \ (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{{r}/{2}} u \in W^s \right\}. \end{equation} Again, it is a Hilbert space for the norm $\lVert u \rVert_{W^{s,r}} = \lVert (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{{r}/{2}} u \rVert_{W^s}$. We have the obvious embeddings, for $s_1 \leq s_2$ and $r_1 \leq r_2$, \begin{align} W^{s_2,r} \subseteq W^{s_1,r}, \\ W^{s,r_2} \subseteq W^{s,r_1}. \end{align} Now, is the following result true? Conjecture: Fix $s_1, s_2, r_1, r_2 \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, \begin{equation} W^{s_1,r_1} \cap W^{s_2,r_2} = W^{\max(s_1,s_2),\max(r_1,r_2)}. \end{equation} Of course, due to the embeddings above, $W^{\max(s_1,s_2),\max(r_1,r_2)}$ is included in $W^{s_1,r_1}$ and $W^{s_2,r_2}$ and therefore in their intersection. Is the other inclusion also valid? 

To Deane Yang, concerning the smoothness of geodesics. These issues have been studied by Hartman and his coauthors more than 40 years ago. Together with Calabi he claimed to prove that in a $C^{\alpha}$ continuous metric all geodesics are uniformly $C^{1,\alpha}$. (I do not have mathscinet access now, but I think the paper was called "On the smoothness of isometries", or something like that). The paper is not quite correct, the computations prove that geodesics are only $C^{1,\alpha /2}$ (this was observed at some point by Reshetnyak). The optimal regularity appears in my paper with Asli Yaman "On Hoelder continuous Riemannian and Finsler metrics" (I apologize for citing my own work). The starting point of all these computations is a metric characterization of $C^{1,\alpha}$ curves in metric terms (in terms of the distance of the midpoint of a pair of points on the curve and the image of the corresponding midpoint of the interval of the definition). It is contained in the work of Hartman, but is probably much older. To Sergei Ivanov: The questions of extendibility of geodesics have also been studied by Hartman. I again do not remember the correct reference, but can check it on Monday. I think he constructs example of even $C^{1,\alpha}$ Riemannian metrics, for any $\alpha <1$, that do not have extendible geodesics. (For $\alpha =1$, the metric has curvature bounded from both sides). Now the main point. I am very sorry and have to apologize for my previous short posting. I slightly misunderstood your question. But I hope that my answer was still correct. Is the following more detailed explanation correct? 

Consider the Besov spaces $B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for parameters $0<p,q\leq \infty$ and $s\in \mathbb{R}$. The weighted Besov space $B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu)$ is defined for $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ by $$ f \in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu) \Leftrightarrow (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{\mu/2} f \in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d). $$ It is know that the space $B_{p_1,q_1}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_1)$ embeds into $B_{p_2,q_2}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_2)$ under the conditions $$ s_2 < s_1, \quad p_1 \leq p_2, \quad s_2 - \frac{d}{p_2} \leq s_1 - \frac{d}{p_1}, \quad \mu_2 \leq \mu_1. $$ See for instance the chapter 4 of Function Spaces, Entropy Numbers, Differential Operators, by Edmunds and Triebel, available here. Question: Are there embeddings results from $B_{p_1,q_1}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_1)$ into $B_{p_2,q_2}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_2)$ for $p_1 > p_2$? Inspired by $L_p$-spaces, my guess is that we still have similar results, with the cost of a stronger condition on the weights, something like $\mu_2 \leq \mu_1 - d(1/p_2 - 1/p_1)$, remarking that $d(1/p_2 - 1/p_1) > 0$ in this case. However, I couldn't find a precise statement of that type. I am looking for a good reference for this question.
