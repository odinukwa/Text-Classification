here's a try: suppose you have a quartic surface in P^3 and ask whether the isomorphism type of plane sections varies or not. If the planes pass through a general common line, the general singularity of the curve section is an odp. If these curve sections are also irreducible, it seems that the conclusion is that the holomorphic type of the sections varies. I.e. the fact that the compactified moduli space of smooth genus 3 curves contains all irreducible nodal curves of genus 3, and is hausdorff, implies that the plane sections of a quartic surface are not all isomorphic. 

As explained to us by Alan Mayer, sheaf cohomology is a generalization of cech cohmology. I found this very helpful. As to the question of how ordinary cohomology arose, Hermann Weyl implies in the revised version of his book Concept of a Riemann surface, that it is a generalization of the Weierstrass, Hensel,and Landsberg approach to Riemann surfaces, focusing first on the behavior of integrals, and passing from that to deductions about the paths of integration. Bott also used to say that a cocyle was "something that hovers over a space and when it sees a cycle, pounces on it and spits out a number". Such a thing he then observed was provided by an integral, and went on to introduce de Rham cohomology as the most natural type. So he too seemed to suggest that the fundamental example giving rise to cohomology was classical integration over cycles. 

This is not as up to the minute as the beautifully detailed thesis linked in the answer above, but just a couple of historical comments. Such a 2 point ramified double cover occurs from an unramified one when a loop shrinks to a point, which... let's see now, does intersect [I believe] the loop on which the double cover is based. Then I believe the induced double cover of the normalized curve is ramified at the 2 points over the singular point. Vice versa, 2 point ramified double covers are a subcase of Beauville's "star - double covers" of curves with one node. E.g. 2 point ramified covers of genus 5 curves are a special case of Beauville's "star - double covers" of genus 6 curves with one node. Anyway such ramified double covers have thus been studied by Wirtinger in the 19th century, and also explicitly by Fay in his book on theta functions, as well as more generally by Beauville. 

Both methods are obviously useful, and I may have under appreciated one of them, but on the relative value of generalization versus specialization in problem solving, I offer the following opinion from Hilbert: "If we do not succeed in solving a mathematical problem, the reason frequently consists in our failure to recognize the more general standpoint from which the problem before us appears only as a single link in a chain of related problems. After finding this standpoint, not only is this problem frequently more accessible to our investigation, but at the same time we come into possession of a method which is applicable also to related problems. The introduction of complex paths of integration by Cauchy and of the notion of the ideals in number theory by Kummer may serve as examples. This way for finding general methods is certainly the most practicable and the most certain; for he who seeks for methods without having a definite problem in mind seeks for the most part in vain. In dealing with mathematical problems, specialization plays, as I believe, a still more important part than generalization. Perhaps in most cases where we seek in vain the answer to a question, the cause of the failure lies in the fact that problems simpler and easier than the one in hand have been either not at all or incompletely solved. All depends, then, on finding out these easier problems, and on solving them by means of devices as perfect as possible and of concepts capable of generalization. This rule is one of the most important levers for overcoming mathematical difficulties and it seems to me that it is used almost always, though perhaps unconsciously." 

there are a couple of relevant paragraphs in Basic algebraic geometry by shafarevich which i recommend, as well as a historical appendix. e.g. he gives an example to show that unlike the one dimensional case, there exist lattices in C^2 for which not even any meromorphic functions can be periodic (chapter VIII.1). in addition to siegel and swinnerton dyer, mumford's other theta functions book is one i would recommend, volume 1 of the three volume series, something like "tata lectures on theta I". Also in lecture IV of his Curves and their Jacobians, now included in his "red book", at least the first 8 pages give an invaluable and succinct introduction to principally polarized abelian varieties and their "moduli" (classifying spaces). And let's get "morphisms" out of the way, since the word appears even in swinnerton -dyer. In one sense it is a generic version of the several terms automorphism, isomorphism, homomorphism, homeomorphism, diffeomorphism,... i.e. a map that preserves some structure to be specified. In algebraic geometry it usually means a structure preserving map that is defined everywhere, as "holomorphic" is used in complex analysis to mean meromorphic and having no poles. so in swinnerton - dyer it probably means holomorphic map. but it is often defined where it is used.
