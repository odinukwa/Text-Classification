Worken is a deverbal noun from what I assume must be the verb worken, obviously borrowed from English to work. I haven't heard anyone use the verb worken in German, so I assume this is an ad-hoc borrowing or code-switching. The crucial point is that even such an ad-hoc borrowing is readily integrated into German morphology and gets a deverbal -en suffix to derive a noun. Conclusion Based on these examples I would say that even very recent borrowings are integrated into the morphology of synthetic languages without any problems. And if this is the case the number of bound morphemes a language uses should have no influence on how many loanwords it accepts. 

(This is mostly a step-by-step explanation of how to make use of the sources acattle pointed out.) The web interface of the Corpus of Contemporary American English offers a collocate search function. Just follow the link and you should see the web interface. Now choose 'Compare' under 'Display', this should make a 'Collocate' box appear immediately under the search box. Then choose 'List' under 'Display', and type in 'like' in the search box. Now press search and you should get the major collocates of 'like' and their frequency. Mark Davies also offers other corpora which you can access with the same interface. If that does not suit your needs you could get another corpus (for example from the sources acattle pointed out) and extract collocates/collocations with a concordancer (a program for accessing/searching corpora). I would recommend the free program Antconc. 

sounds to me as if the classifier was trained and for such a task manually annotated data is often used. The classifier has no idea how this training data was annotated in this way, it just has the annotation as information and (presumably) information on the classification outcome. In other words, the training data is not transparent to the classifier, it just has to take it as it is. 

Is the term Japanese English used by anybody? Several comments to this question indicated doubts that terms such as Japanese English are appropriate or used by anybody. In fact, in research on English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) (and on postcolonial varieties of English) such terms are used frequently. A quick search on Google scholar turns up several instances, such as studies on intonation, language contact and bilingual families. Educational implications Sometimes terms such as Japanese English are used as synonyms of English as spoken by learners whose first language is Japanese. Then their use has no educational implications. Other researchers might consciously opt for Japanese English etc. to underscore their commitment to teaching English as a second/foreign language without positing native speaker norms as a realistic goal or even ideal that learners should strive for. Instead, they should aim for international intelligibility, such as Jennifer Jenkins' Lingua Franca Core. This philosophy is based on the recognition that 

(This is marked as disputed in the Wikipedia article, but sounds sensible to me and I think I've also read it elsewhere. Still, if you can cite sources disputing this feel free to rectify it.) Question: The Arabic script is also used for a range of non-Semitic languages, such as Farsi/Persian and Urdu. Despite a fair degree of influence from Arabic, these languages do not follow the Arabic/Semitic system where roots rely on (three) consonants. Does this have any practical consequences? Is there any evidence that the use of the Arabic script for non-Semitic languages makes reading and writing harder? Or the use of other Abjads, such as the Hebrew script for Yiddish? My attempt at an answer, so far: 

More recently, 1930s corpora of British and American English have been compiled to add to the historical depth of the Brown family, and work has begun on additional corpora. 

Consequently, native speaker norms are argued to be relatively unimportant to their needs. What should be the aim is teaching a variety of English that is internationally intelligible. Are there native speakers of Japanese English? Alex B. argued in the comments to the OP that Japanese English is not an appropriate term because there are no native speakers of this variety of English. However, there are also very few native speakers of Indian English, the vast majority of speakers of Indian English acquire it when entering school or later, and yet the term is relatively accepted. Research into postcolonial varieties of English has largely come to the conclusion that the existence of native speakers is irrelevant to the emergence of a separate variety of English. What is important is a community of speakers, (relatively) separated from other communities, that transmits their variety to future generations. There is a large body of research providing evidence for these claims, and Schneider's Postcolonial English is probably the most important theoretical contribution to the debate. P.S.: Who is a native speaker, anyway? Actually, the concept of the native speaker is hard to apply to multilingual societies such as India and Nigeria where English is widely used as a second language. When people acquire two languages from birth, and a third language in school, and finally end up being more proficient in many areas in the third language (chronologically speaking), what is their native language? The concept of the native speaker is based on the 18th/19th/20th c. Western idea that one nation has one language. This works pretty well for most people in most Western countries (minus recent immigrants), but it didn't in Renaissance, medieval or earlier Europe, where educated people or traders from any country were supposed to be proficient in several languages - Latin, French, Italian, a local dialect, a local standard language. 

If you want a broad overview of variation in a wide variety of languages have a look at the field typology and language universals. Two standard text books that I found excellent are 

The other answers have raised many important aspects why diphthongs are a useful concept, and I'd like to add some points that I personally feel are crucial in this debate. Proofs I'm not sure insisting on a proof of the existence of diphthongs will help you understand why many use the concept diphthong to analyse language. There is no proof that they exist because they don't. They are an abstraction (just like the phoneme), a way of analysing or describing language and the same phenomenon can be described in many different ways. There isn't any proof of gravity either - if an apple falls down, and you insist it's because of gravity I could still say it's because it is the nature of apples to fall down to Earth or that God likes apples to fall down etc. and we'd be no wiser. However, you could say that your theory of gravity explains a whole lot of other things at the same time, such as pears falling down and celestial bodies rotating around each other. In this sense gravity is a very elegant concept because it explains many phenomena at the same time. Diphthongs are not combinations of monophthongs In the same way I can point out how diphthongs allow a more elegant description of (for example) English phonology. There are 12 monophthongs in English (RP). If we allow combinations of two monophthongs we should expect to find all or almost all such combinations - 12!/(12-2)! = 132. But there are only 8 diphthongs in English (RP). Of course we could come up with a number of rules stating that such an such monophthongs cannot occur together. We would need so many such rules that our description of English phonology would become bloated. Diphthongs are a more elegant abstraction for describing the sound system of English. Syllables Sverre pointed out that syllables must contain a single vowel and if there is movement from one vowel target to another then the syllable contains a diphthong. You argued that 

This phenomenon occurs in many varieties of English, but doesn't got as for as neutralising the contrast. The transcription that @Wilson gives ([t͡ʃɹi]) captures this reasonably well. This might be a consequence of the backward movement of the tongue after [t] during which it passes the place of articulation of [ʃ]. As such, the phenomenon is one of co-articulation and not a phonological process. So an onset /t͡ʃɹ/ (which might be spelled chr if it weren't for the confusion with /kɹ/ as in Christmas) is still illegal in English phonotactics. However, over time this co-articulatory process may become so common that it is phonologised and the contrast is neutralised. In fact, the eminent phonetician John Wells argues in his blog that it already has been (thanks to @Sumelic for the link). His case in point is the pair century - sentry. 

A strict distinction between competence (the abstract grammar of a language that speakers have implicit knowledge of) and performance (the actual products of this grammar - utterance produced by speakers) prevented this. Generative grammarians argued that (1) corpora don't provide negative evidence - they don't tell us what kinds of sentences are not possible or ungrammatical, and that (2) performance is tainted by the limitations of the human mind (limited memory and attention span, tiredness etc.) (@PElliot points out in the comments that this argument is based "on misunderstanding of the difference between performance and competence) For example, recursion (such as in The man the woman the child... saw called) is infinite in terms of competence, but in actual performance few iterations are possible - you end up losing track of how the different parts are supposed to go together. Any attempts to filter out these confounding influences were considered futile to the extent that using corpora (collections of actual language use - performance) was considered unscientific in generative grammar. We are used to thinking about communities of scientists as the pinnacle of rational thinking but in reality, what is considered scientific or unscientific relies very much on tradition and what the consensus is at a given time. Once a certain consensus has formed, it takes enormous effort (by individual scientists and the whole community) to re-examine this consensus. However, the last 20 years or so have seen some dialogue between generative grammarians and corpus linguists, leading to a conference on dialogue between the two fields and other publications. EDIT: Here's an example from Carnie, Andrew. 2002. Syntax. A Generative Introduction (p. 10-11): 

Marked phonemes are those that require more effort during articulation or are "harder" to articulate. For example, the interdental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/ are considered to be marked. Marked phonemes are 

Nouns referring to persons also pose an interesting problem. Das Kind (child) and das Mädchen (girl) are both neuter, which suggests that the unmarked grammatical gender for pronouns referring to them is also neuter. Indeed, prescriptive German grammar has it that neuter nouns can only be referred to by neuter pronouns, as in this example: 

x shouted "...", x said "..." etc. are called quotatives. Another term is verbum dicendi. There is a fairly extensive body of literature on quotatives in varieties of English. The quotative that has recently attracted a lot of interest is be like, as in 

Some varieties of English have plural personal pronouns that are composed in roughly the way you're asking. Southern US English you'all/ y'all is composed of the 2nd p. singular pronoun + plural marker all. Because there is now a separate 2nd p. plural pronoun you tends to be restricted to singular reference. I understand the other comments as saying that Japanese tachi in watashi-tachi is a plural marker that it is also used in other circumstances as a plural marker. you'all doesn't meet that definition because it's not grammaticalised as a morphological plural marker. But it marks plurality lexically and could in the future be grammaticalised as a plural marker. Tok Pisin Tok Pisin is an English-based creole (more specifically: English is the lexifier language) spoken in Papua New Guinea. The morpheme pela (from English fellow) argueably works as a plural (or not-singular) marker in the pronoun system: 

It is possible the OED version online is abridged. I think I read something of the sort on the website, but unfortunately I can't access it any more via your link (though I could at first, strange...). If it is indeed the unabridged version, I dare say it will be difficult for you to find more extensive commentaries. The fact that you found a PIE root mentioned under a certain entry in dictionary A but not B could of course mean that dictionary B erroneously omitted a widely accepted etymology for this word. But it could also mean, and I think this is the more likely explanation, that B's editors omitted it because they thought the evidence is not sufficient to include this etymology/reconstruction. You also asked for literature that "connects or explains ... the evolution of meanings". I am afraid it might be difficult to find such literature for a wide range of words. Etymological dictionaries are concise in the information they offer because it is expected that readers will know common sound laws and other developments that will fill many of the "gaps" you mentioned. It's not as if every reader will go away with all questions answered, but most of them are. What is available in terms of more extensive literature on specific words will mostly be unsatisfactory because the discussions will be quite specialised. My recommendation is, similar to jlawler's, that you read a good textbook, such as Baugh & Cable's The History of the English Language. In addition to this, or if your interest very narrowly focusses on sound change, you might want to read what Wikipedia has to say on sound laws. Verner's law and Grimm's law are particularly well known. If you pursue any of this, it will lead you a bit away from looking at specific words and their reconstructed history. Instead, you'll get the larger picture of how languages develop and change. It's a bit like the difference between learning how many electrons there are in an iron atom, and what that actually means for the chemical reactions that iron can be involved in. I'm not saying that looking at specific words and their histories is wrong, but it can only get you so far, and it's possible you have exhausted this avenue.
