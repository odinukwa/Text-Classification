A series of mechanical filters (coarse rocks, fine rocks, coarse sand, fine sand) to remove macroscopic contaminants (eg. dirt) from the water. By using several different sizes of material, he's extending the life of the filter: each layer will tend to block material that would clog the next layer down, with the fine sand acting to protect the charcoal. A chemical filter (charcoal) to remove chemical contaminants from the water. This doesn't work by physically blocking them, but by absorption: essentially, the chemicals "stick" to the charcoal as the water moves past it. 

For overnight trips, I don't bother with a change of clothes, just a spare pair of socks. For two nights, I add underwear and a shirt. I'll only carry warm clothing if the forecast calls for cold nights. 

It's called the "mountain climber's weight loss program": eat everything you want, and climb two mountains a week. Serious rock climbers aren't fat because they can't eat enough to get fat. Climbing a mountain, or spending a day bouncing up and down a cliff, can easily burn 10,000 calories. No matter how much you eat, your digestive system can't process food fast enough to replace that. 

I'm not familiar with the Wichita refuge; my bison experience comes from the Yellowstone area. That said, I would never describe bison as being particularly "active": they spend most of their time either resting or grazing, with the herd slowly moving on to uneaten patches of grass. If you want to see bison running around, mating season (on the Wichita refuge, June and July) will see bulls competing for mates. The best time of day to look for bison is whenever you feel like it. Bison don't make any effort to hide, so you shouldn't have any difficulty spotting them if they're in the area. 

Some back-of-the-envelope calculations: 12 volts * 4 amps = 48 watts * 8 hours = 384 watt-hours. That's the minimum battery capacity you'll need to power this for a night. The Goal Zero Sherpa 50 you propose to use will power it for about an hour, give or take efficiency losses. To power the blanket for the night, you're looking for something more along the lines of the Yeti 400. Solar charging is also a problem: you can only expect 4-6 hours of good sunlight unless you're constantly moving or re-aiming your panel, so you'll want at least a 100-watt panel. You should never fully discharge a lead-acid battery: doing so will destroy the battery in only a few charge-discharge cycles. For reasonable life, you'll want to work with the top half of capacity (deep-cycle battery) or the top 10% (automotive battery). To power an electric blanket for the night, you'll want a 64+ amp-hour battery (deep cycle) or 320+ amp-hour (automotive). 25 pounds of lithium batteries, 100+ pounds of lead-acid batteries, or just get a warmer sleeping bag? I know which I'd pick. Edit: In response to your list of additional gear, a Sherpa 50 cannot run the frying pan: it's got a current draw of 13 amps, while the Sherpa 50 has a maximum output of 8 amps. The rest of your list is fairly reasonable, assuming the lights are LED and not incandescent. 

The easy technique is to simply hold the spear in your hand with the tip under the water and stab the fish. Once your spear enters the water, refraction has identical effects on your view of the spear point and your view of the fish, so you can easily guide it to where you want. Throwing a spear to hit a fish takes a great deal of practice. The physics of refraction is sufficiently non-linear that the only practical way is trial and lots of error. 

Look under the bridge for cracked or rotted beams -- in particular, cracking in the middle of the bridge, or rotten wood at the ends. If the bridge is more sophisticated than a deck nailed on top of a couple of logs, look at the joints for obvious damage. Stand on one end of the bridge and shift your weight from side to side. The bridge should not move -- any motion is likely the result of damage to the foundations. Take a few steps out onto the bridge and bounce up and down. The bridge may bounce with you, but shouldn't make any abrupt movements or alarming sounds. 

For any reasonable depth (ie. something you'd be willing to dig without specialized machinery), a deeper hole makes for a more stable temperature. The extra mass of soil surrounding your cellar acts to average out temperature changes: shallow burial averages out day-night shifts, while deeper averages out seasonal changes as well. The end result is that a deep enough hole will hold a constant temperature, at the annual average temperature of your location. 

At a guess? A change in architecture. Pigeons favor cliff ledges as nesting sites; they'll happily build nests on window ledges as a substitute for natural cliffs. Sparrows favor cavities: tree hollows, the eaves of roofs, and other somewhat-enclosed areas. If there's been a trend of replacing traditional houses with high-rise apartments, I'd expect a corresponding shift from sparrows to pigeons. 

Some mountains change height at a surprisingly fast rate. For example, the magma chamber beneath the Yellowstone caldera is currently inflating. This is causing some of the nearby mountains to grow by as much as an inch or two per year. 

In general, a human weighs much less than a bridge. If the bridge looks like it's capable of supporting its own weight, it's probably capable of supporting its weight plus you. Any damage that brings the bridge to the verge of collapsing is likely to be quite visible. 

Most of the time, the "Known to the State of California" warning is an incantation to ward off lawyers. That's not true for fuel. White gas/Coleman fuel/whatever-it's-called has significant amounts of benzene, a known carcinogen, in it, as does kerosene; other hydrocarbon fuels will have trace amounts. Benzene is destroyed during combustion, but the vapors from unburned fuel are a hazard. Make sure you close the fuel bottle tightly when it's not in use, handle the fuel outdoors or in a well-ventilated area, and make sure your stove is burning cleanly (it should produce a blue flame indicating complete combustion; a yellow flame indicates that the fuel isn't being fully burned). This is a great example of why that warning is a problem: the occasional real hazard (such as benzene in fuel) gets lost in a sea of empty statements. 

Zion has only one unpaved road you're likely to want to drive on: a one-mile stretch of the Lava Point road. That road is marked on the map as "impassible when wet", which I suspect means an SUV won't do any better than a sedan in bad weather; it's not marked as high-clearance, so a sedan will do just fine in good weather. There are no unpaved roads in Bryce; the roads are either open to everything or closed to all traffic depending on the conditions. 

I carry two headlamps and no spare batteries. The headlamps use the same type of batteries, so I can switch between them if needed. 

Since you describe it as "near your residence", it's probably what is known as an "urban micro": a small, camouflaged container attached to something like a street sign or a lamp post. 

The big risk in geyser basins is that you can't see what's going on underground. There are often latent hot springs or fumaroles: areas where hot water or steam has eroded the ground almost all the way to the surface. If you step on one of these areas, you may break through the crust and find yourself immersed in boiling water or high-temperature steam. The safest option when traveling in a geyser basin is to stay on the established trail or boardwalk. Geothermal features do occasionally form under a trail, but it's not common, and trails are generally monitored for this. If you need to go off-trail and you're not familiar with the basin in question, the safest option is to only step where there are plants growing. The presence of live plants is a sign that the ground is cool. It doesn't mean you won't break through the crust, but it does mean that if you do, you'll only need to be rescued from a pit, rather than having your body recovered from a newly-formed hot spring. 

The crime rate on most trails is 0, due to the very low frequency of use. The trails that have had a crime committed on them tend to have a very high crime rate, again due to the low frequency of use. There are only a few trails that have high enough usage for the crime rate statistics to be dominated by something other than random chance.
