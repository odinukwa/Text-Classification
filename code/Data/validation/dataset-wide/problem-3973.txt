Block Cholesky Blocking the Cholesky decomposition is often done for an arbitrary (symmetric positive definite) matrix. I didn't immediately find a textbook treatment, but the description of the algorithm used in PLAPACK is simple and standard. In their algorithm they do not use the factorization of C, just of A. That allows them to reduce the problem of chol([A,B*;B,C]) to just chol(A) and chol(Q). The point of the algorithm is that you do not choose A and C to have the same size. You choose A to fit nicely in cache, and do your work at a higher BLAS level. In other words, A is a real block, and C is just leftover garbage you'll need to sweep up next. In particular, C is discarded and replaced by Q during the algorithm, but chol(Q) is also computed by decomposing Q itself into a block matrix. This means that the algorithm is discarding any information you had about C, so if C is fixed while B varies, this would be quite wasteful. 

Frank Tall proved that under $MA+\neg CH$ there is a regular first-countable space with caliber $\omega_1$ which is not separable. (see Tall, Franklin D., First countable spaces with caliber $\aleph_1$ may or may not be separable, Set-theor. Topol., Vol. dedic. to M.K. Moore, 353-358 (1977). ZBL0382.54003.) Applying the Moore Machine to Tall's example you get what you're looking for. 

If you're interested in the relationship between the ccc and separability, you should read Stevo Todorcevic's survey "Chain condition methods in topology". $URL$ It's a very convincing pamphlet on the power of chain conditions, clarifying that relationship with such beautiful theorems as: 1) (Todorcevic) Let X be compact Hausdorff. If every subspace of $X^2$ has the ccc then $X$ is separable. 2) (Rosenthal) A compact Hausdorff space $X$ is ccc if and only if every weakly compact subspace of $C(X)$ is separable. Also, there's a whole book dedicated to chain conditions. It's called "Chain conditions in topology", by Wistar Comfort and Stelios Negropontis (Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics #79, Cambridge University Press). 

Sure, you just take direct products of metabelian groups with different character degrees: cd(G×H) = cd(G)×cd(H) and (G×H)′ = G′×H′. I suggest taking G(p) = AGL(1,p) = Hol(p) to be the normalizer of a Sylow p-subgroup in the symmetric group of degree p, for each prime p, but there are lots of examples. For instance: 

The higher dimensional Heisenberg groups are the matrix groups G(V,R,f) = { [ 1, x, z ; 0, 1, y ; 0, 0, 1] : x,y in V, z in R } where V is an R-module, R is a ring, and f is an alternating R-bilinear form on V. Typically V is a free R-module, and R is a field or the integers, and f is a block diagonal matrix with blocks [0,1;-1,0]. Sometimes V is just called a symplectic space over R. The group has a normal series 1 ≤ ⟨ z: z in R ⟩ ≤ ⟨ y,z : y in V, z in R ⟩ ≤ G. This gives a very nice presentation of the group as ⟨ x,y,z : [x,y] = f(x,y), [x,z] = [y,z] = 1 ⟩ where the relations from V (for various "x", and also for various "y") and R (for various "z") are implicitly added. For instance taking V free of rank 2 over R=Z, you get ⟨ x1, x2, y1, y2, z : [ x1, y1 ] = [ x2, y2 ] = z, [ x1, x2 ] = [ y1, y2 ] = [ z, x1 ] = [ z, x2 ] = [ z, y1 ] = [ z, y2 ] = [ x1, y2 ] = [ x2, y1 ] = 1 ⟩. This is a very pretty presentation, but is not usually "free". Way too many things commute. However, these types of groups are very important. When R=Z/pZ, these are the extra-special groups of exponent p. Rather than "free products" they are "central products". These form reasonably nice examples of just-non-abelian groups, since V can be a fairly arbitrary R-module as long as R is Z/pZ. 

Let $\theta$ be a large enough regular cardinal and $M \prec H(\theta)$ be a countably closed elementary submodel of $H(\theta)$ of cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$ such that $\mathfrak{c} \subset M$ and $\{Y, \tau, \mathcal{F}, \mathfrak{c}\} \subset M$. We claim that $\mathcal{F} \subset M$. Suppose this is not the case and let $K \in \mathcal{F} \setminus M$. Using compactness and regularity of $Y$, we can write every closed $G_\delta$ set $F \subset Y$ in the form $F=\bigcap \{\overline{V_n(F)}: n < \omega \}$, for a suitable decreasing family of open neighbourhoods $\{V_n(F): n < \omega \}$ of $F$. If $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$, then the family $\{V_n(F): n < \omega \}$ may be fixed in $M$, but then we actually have $\{V_n(F): n < \omega \} \subset M$. Note now that for every $x \in \overline{Y \cap M}$, we can find $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$ such that $x \in F$. Indeed, let $x \in \overline{Y \cap M} \setminus Y \cap M$. Then there is $F \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $x \in F$. Let $x_n$ be any point of $U_n(F) \cap Y \cap M$. Using compactness of $F$ and the fact that $F=\bigcap \{\overline{U_n(F)}: n <\omega \}$ we can easily see that the sequence $\{x_n: n < \omega \}$ converges to $F$, in the sense that, every open neighbourhood of $F$ contains a final segment of $\{x_n: n < \omega \}$. Now by $\omega$-closedness of $M$, we have that $\{x_i: i \geq n \} \in M$, for every $n<\omega$ and hence the set: $$\mathcal{S}=\{K \in \mathcal{F}: \{x_n: n <\omega \} \rightarrow K \}$$ is an element of $M$ (the formula defining that set has all free variables in $M$). Note that since every compact Hausdorff space is normal, $F$ can be separated from a closed set disjoint from it by a pair of disjoint open sets. Therefore, we have that if $G \in \mathcal{S}$ then $G \cap F \neq \emptyset$. Hence $|\mathcal{S}| \leq 2^{\aleph_0}$ by assumption. But then we actually have that $\mathcal{S} \subset M$ and hence $F \in M$, as we wanted. For every $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$ we have $\{H \in \mathcal{F} : F \cap H \neq \emptyset \} \in M$, and, since $|\{H \in \mathcal{F} : F \cap H \neq \emptyset \}| \leq \mathfrak{c}$, we also have $\{H \in \mathcal{F} : F \cap H \neq \emptyset \} \subset M$. So, for every $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$, we have $F \cap K=\emptyset$. Now, by compactness of $K$, we can find for every $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$, an integer $n <\omega$ such that $\overline{U_n(F)} \cap K=\emptyset$. Thus for every $x \in \overline{Y \cap M}$, we can find an open neighbourhood $U_x \in M$ of $x$ such that $U_x \cap K=\emptyset$. Now $\mathcal{U}=\{U_x: x \in \overline{Y \cap M} \}$ is an open cover of the compact space $\overline{Y \cap M}$ such that $\mathcal{U} \subset M$. So there is a finite set $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{U}$ such that $\overline{Y \cap M} \subset \bigcup \mathcal{G}$. This implies that $M \models Y \subset \bigcup \mathcal{G}$ and hence $H(\theta) \models Y \subset \bigcup \mathcal{G}$. But this contradicts $K \cap \bigcup \mathcal{G}=\emptyset$. So $\mathcal{F} \subset M$ and hence $|\mathcal{F}| \leq |M| \leq \mathfrak{c}$. 

At any rate, both violate the bound, though requiring different conjugates. At least when I was looking at the modular representations induced by Specht modules I noticed there is no convention in the published articles or software on which of the two modules is a Specht module and which is its dual. Over a field of characteristic 0 they are isomorphic, but over finite fields they are just dual. I suspect the entries of the matrices in the representation of the Specht module are not terribly well defined; you'll need to have some combinatorial definition to work from to even decide isomorphism over Z/pZ, much less exact entries. 

The reason why my Hausdorff non-regular counterexample above is perfect is that it is a countable union of closed discrete sets. Now, Uspenskij constructed $\sigma$-closed discrete ccc regular spaces of arbitrarily large cardinality. So that answers my question in the negative. See this paper: $URL$ 

A positive answer would lead to a common generalization of Arhangel'skii's Theorem and the Hajnal-Juhasz theorem stating that first-countable CCC spaces have cardinality at most continuum. 

Indeed, let $X$ be a first-countable cellular-Lindelof space. Then $c(X) \leq \mathfrak{c}$ (this follows from Arhangel'skii's Theorem stating that every Lindelof first-countable space has cardinality at most continuum). Combining that with the Hajnal-Juhasz inequality $|X| \leq 2^{\chi(X) \cdot c(X)}$ (where $\chi(X)$ denotes the character of $X$) we obtain that $|X| \leq 2^{\mathfrak{c}}$. 

It seems to me that SL(n,K) should have other irreducible representations other than just these polynomial representations, just because the paths defined by the operators are so symmetric. I think for SL(2,K) this is basically all there is, perhaps allowing for field automorphisms to be applied first. 

Here is part 1″ solved, but the answer is complex and too long for a comment or edit. Notation is similar but not identical to before: Let f be a separable, irreducible polynomial of degree d. Let B be the block-Toeplitz matrix whose diagonal blocks are the companion matrix of f, whose first super-diagonal blocks are the identity matrix, and whose other blocks are 0. Let b be the number of diagonal blocks. Let { vi : i = 1,...,b*d } be the standard basis. We wish to express each vi for i≥2 in terms of v1, f, and b. In terms of k[x]-modules, B is the action of x on the module M = k[x]/(f^b) in the basis where v1 = 1 + (f^b), and vi are unknown polynomials related to f and b. The matrix explicitly says that vi⋅B = vi+1 + vi+d when d does not divide i−1. This can be solved for: 

An open neighbourhood assignment for a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is a map $U: X \to \tau$ such that $x \in U(x)$, for every $x \in X$. A space $X$ is called a $D$-space if for every open neighbourhood assignment $U$ there is a closed discrete set $D \subset X$ such that $X=\bigcup \{U(x): x \in D \}$. The famous $D$-space problem of van Douwen asks whether every regular Lindelof space is a D-space. 

Joel has already shown you that none of the standard separation axioms is enough to force a positive answer to your question (by the way, the Sorgenfrey line is even perfectly normal). A notable case for which your question has a positive answer is that of a topological group. Define the $\pi$-weight of $X$ ($\pi w(X)$) to be the least cardinality of a family $\mathcal{P}$ of non-empty open subsets of $X$ such that for every non-empty open set $U \subset X$ there is $P \in \mathcal{P}$ such that $P \subset U$. It is clear that if $RO(X)$ is a base for $X$ then the density of $RO(X)$ coincides with the $\pi$-weight of $X$. This happens, in particular, if $X$ is a regular space. Now topological groups are regular, and the $\pi$-weight and the weight of a topological group coincide. (for a proof of that see, for example, Arhangel’skii, Alexander; Tkachenko, Mikhail, Topological groups and related structures, Atlantis Studies in Mathematics 1. Hackensack, NJ: World Scientific; Paris: Atlantis Press (ISBN 978-90-78677-06-2/hbk). xiv, 781 p. (2008). ZBL1323.22001.) Another case in which $\pi w(X)=w(X)$ is when $X$ is a metric space (because the $\pi$-weight is bounded below by the density and bounded above by the weight, and for metric spaces, the weight and the density coincide). 

That is what I assume you meant. This gives "Runtime error: too much looping" in V2.16-10. Magma agrees that MinP over Z/3Z has Galois group S5, and A5 over the field with four elements (a silly trick you might use if you want to stick with magma). 

Cholesky update Rank one updates, chol(A) to chol(A+xx*), are easy and safe. Rank one "downdates", chol(A) to chol(A-xx*), are easy but require a little care: stable algorithms are given in Stewart's Matrix Algorithms Vol 1, Algorithm 4.3.8, p. 347. Chapter 12.5 of Golub–Van Loan has some similar stuff, and Cholesky down-dating in 12.5.4. This function has been widely implemented, and the cholupdate command in matlab dates back to 1979 code from LINPACK. [0,B*;B,0] is a sum of rank one matrices, and so by updating and downdating those rank one guys, you could probably get what you want, and it might even be faster than chol(Q). However, it can be a lot better to update more ranks at a time. Apparently this is a common request in machine learning, and M. Seeger wrote a technical report on this problem of low rank updates to a Cholesky factorization, and mentions several common pitfalls, especially as regards to actually doing it with existing software. A more scholarly (and older) treatment is in section 3 of this article version of Ch. 12.5 of GvL: Gill, P. E.; Golub, G. H.; Murray, W.; Saunders, M. A. "Methods for modifying matrix factorizations." Math. Comp. 28 (1974), 505–535. MR343558 DOI:10.2307/2005923 Davis and Hager in MR1824053 note that algorithm C1 can be used for a reasonably efficient, multiple rank, single pass, update of a dense matrix (and go on to describe sparse techniques). Note that these mostly do not take advantage of the block structure of [0,B*;B,0], so you might find something better that is more specialized. 

Ramiro, regarding 2), the set of all points in $I^\kappa$ with at most countably many non-zero coordinates is even Frechet-Urysohn, for every $\kappa$. This is due to Noble (see also exercise 3.10.D in Engelking). Note: Frechet-Urysohn means that given a non-closed set $A$ and a point $x \in \overline{A} \setminus A $, there is a sequence inside $A$ converging to $x$. 

The answer to the first half of your question is no, though, at least consistently. Let $\mathbb{N}^*=\beta \mathbb{N} \setminus \mathbb{N}$ be the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers. Under the Continuum Hypothesis, the set of all $P$-points is a dense subset of $\mathbb{N}^*$. But $\mathbb{N}^*$ has no dense meager subset. Indeed, let $\{N_n: n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ be a sequence of nowhere dense sets. Construct a decreasing sequence of open sets $\{U_n: n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ such that $U_n \cap D_n =\emptyset$ and $\overline{U_{n+1}} \subset U_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The set $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \overline{U_n}=\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ is non-empty because of compactness. Moreover, every countable intersection of open subsets of $\mathbb{N}^*$ has non-empty interior (see, for example, Jan van Mill's chapter on $\beta \mathbb{N}$ in the Handbook of Set-theoretic Topology). Thus $Int(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n)$ is a non-empty open set missing every $N_n$ and hence $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} N_n$ is not dense. 

which simply returns fail since no such counterexample of order 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 exists. To test the higher orders one uses: 

These are called Hopfian modules. I didn't see any particularly exciting general characterization, but there are several special case characterizations (that show up easily in a google or mathscinet search). There are also several papers devoted to giving "interesting" examples. An exercise in Lam's Lectures on Modules and Rings asks one to prove that every finitely generated module over a commutative ring is Hopfian (so if the ring is not-noetherian, this is a generalization).
