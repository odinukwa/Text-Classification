You can also get a list of languages and sounds from UPSID, which has a web interface here. However, it is best to select a language with a number of speakers available to you. !Xoon may be nice and exotic, but it is not trivial to find speakers of the language. You need to have a reasonable number of speakers providing data, so that you have a basis for claiming that what you've found is a property of the language and not just a quirk of the individual speaker. You also should decide why you are doing this, and what kind of information you need going into the study. One reason to study Icelandic or Finnish is that the phonetics and especially phonology of those languages has been reasonably well worked out, which is not quite the case with Ket, Oromo or Somali. If your goal is to develop a Somali speech-recognition package, you would have to undertake a lot of primary descriptive research on the language in order to be able to know what phonetic data to get. Similarly, there probably would not be enough consumer demand for a Mazateco synthesizer to justify the cost. On the other hand, if you're just interested in an academic study, Mazateco would be a fine language to study. There's also a potential tradeoff between number of phonemes and degree of contextual variation. When a language has relatively few phonemes, it is communicatively less important to produce a sound in one specific way as opposed to something similar, so a languages with fewer phonemes may have more phonetic processes leading to allophonic variation. [EDIT] A concrete example is Hindi. There are plenty of speakers, and there is also a decent amount of phonological and phonetic literature so that you wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel, axle, and saw. I use Google translate synthesis as a crude metric of the state of the art in phonetic NLP for a language, and Hindi seems to be in good shape. Tamil, on the other hand, is in quite sad shape by that metric, and the remaining languages of India are in no shape at all. The state of the art in phonological and phonetic description for Tamil is, at the same time, significantly below that for Hindi. Overall, the best approach, when one is first learning how to do programming on languages, is to pick a language that you know reasonably well. This allows you to catch errors much quicker, when you have some ability to judge that an output is wrong. 

The phrase "used to reconstruct language families using the comparative method" is not literally meaningful, since you can reconstruct linguistic forms or you can make hypotheses about the grouping of languages into families, but you can't reconstruct a family. I think you mean "used in the reconstruction of an earlier stage of a language". As example of that would be the derivation of long vowels in proto-Indo-European from the loss of earlier laryngeals. That would be a case of compensatory lengthening as Jlawler mentions. In addition to vocalic merger (with or without there having been an intervening consonant), there are various prosodic causes. The Norwegian case, which has a parallel in North Saami, involves a change in syllabification where VCCV could be parsed as V.CC or VC.CV, and the change is from non-branching onsets to branching onsets with no coda i.e. VC.CV -> V.CCV. A frequent instance of that is lengthening of vowels before NC clusters in Bantu. Another very common one is stress-related: stress may be assigned to some position, and that causes vowel lengthening (a number of Bantu languages, Mohawk, etc.). A third context for lengthening is "minimality" related, where monosyllables (typically) have to lengthen their vowel because every word has to have at least two moras (various Bantu, Arabic dialects). Numerous historical questions are associated with lengthening, such as "does lengthening by such-and-such process require pre-existing phonemic vowel length", but you'd have to be more specific about what connection between lengthening and reconstruction you're asking about. 

The comments reflect the complexity of "there" subjects, and I'm fairly certain that jlawler can fill us in on previous work on the topic. I will just long-comment on data problems. First, 'there' can be a deictic or a dummy (the former exemplified by "There is the remote, here is the TV", meaning "over yonder"; the latter by "There's a monkey in the garden"). Within the dummy uses, there + copula can be further divided into existential and what one call "considerative" versions: "there are fleas on the cat" meaning that fleas exist or are present on the cat, versus "well, one possibility is...". In response to a question like "Where shall we go" or "What do you want for dinner", you can say "One possibility is NP", or "There's NP". A caveat is required about judgments: when I say "X is ungrammatical", I mean it's unacceptable in the dialect that I speak, so it's not a claim about rural Floridian or Tasmanian English. With the deictic use, agreement with post-copular NP is mandatory: "There are (*is) the keys I've been looking for" â€“ "there" can be stressed, and you can substitute various other deictics like "here, yonder". Existential "there", which is unstressed, generally requires a following locative (which could be a deictic like "there", "here", "yonder"), so "There are children in that school", "There is a child in that school" (paraphrasing "A child is in that school"), but *"There is a child a thief" (from "The child is a thief"). The subject is indefinite ("There is a (*the) cow in the well"). Agreement is required (*"There is cows in the hills") though this may be possible in some dialects), and contraction of the copula is optional. This use is perfectly normal as an out-of-the-blue utterance, and you could felicitously enter a room and say "Holy cow, there's a pig in the bed". A closely related construction is the "There copula NP RElClaus" construction, exemplified by "There are people who speak French", "There is a child who sings opera". The previous existential construction could be derived from "NP is LOC" by inversion, but this is not plausible here (*"People are who speak French", though ok "People exist who speak French"). I can't at this point muster an opinion as to whether "?There exists a cow in the well" is ungrammatical versus just stupid-sounding. The agreement patterns are the same for these constructions, whether or not you use the copula or "exist". The construction "There copula NP" doesn't take a post-verbal locative (or anything), and is used to offer an NP choice: this requires a context that calls for a choice. In response to "How do I remove this tree?", the answer can be "There's dynamite, there's a chainsaw, there's the bucksaw, or there's an ax". A singular copula is AFAICT always possible and maybe required ("How do we fasten this board to the house?" "There's nails" *"There are nails", though this might be possible for some speakers of my dialect). Contraction is probably required: "There's (*There is) chicken". In other words, you have to pin down the specific construction of the form "There copula NP" that you're looking at. 

I vote for Sanskrit, on the grounds that contemporary Sanskrit speakers could almost certainly converse with 3,000+ (or more) year old Sanskrit speakers. Perhaps you have a special definition of "modern language" that would exclude Sanskrit. The answer partially depends on whether you require only written-form intelligibility, or do the spoken forms also have to be intelligible? In which case, a proper test must exclude bilinguals (in particular modern Arabic speakers who also know Classical Arabic; modern greek speakers who also learned Ancient Greek). And then, do you mean that the grapheme shapes are sufficiently similar that knowledge of the modern written form allows you to understand the older written form? This could have a significant effect on Chinese, Sanskrit (also Tamil) and Hebrew, w.r.t. this question. 

I am looking for a list of lexical roots for Punjabi, with frequency information whereby one can get an idea what the 1000 most-frequent words of the language are. I need to exclude case forms etc. hence lemmata; I also need to exclude grammatical particles and interjections, looking for just nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs. If there is none, a possible substitute could come from a closely-related language (I don't have a handle on relatedness issues on modern IA). Any script is okay, transliterated is preferred (Gurmukhi is second runner-up), and glossed would be helpful.
