Fix integers $n,d>0$. (I'm probably thinking about $n\leq 6$ and $d\leq 2000$.) Let $X$ be the set of matrices $A\in U(n)$ such that the entries of $dA$ lie in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. 

It is very rare for these rings to be integral domains. To see this, put $$ f_V(t)=\sum_kc_k(V)t^{\dim(V)-k} \in H^*(BG)[t]. $$ (All cohomology here has rational coefficients.) It is then standard that $H_G^*(PV)=H^*(BG)[x]/f_V(x)$, and also that $f_{V\oplus W}(t)=f_V(t)f_W(t)$. From this it is clear that $H_G^*(PV)$ can only be a domain if $V$ is irreducible. However, irreducibility is far from being sufficient. To see this, let $T$ be a maximal torus with Weyl group $W$. By a "fake representation" of $G$ I will mean a $W$-invariant representation of $T$. The $W$-orbits in $T^*$ give a basis over $\mathbb{N}$ for the fake representations. Because $H^*(BG)=H^*(BT)^W$, a fake representation $V$ still has an associated polynomial $f_V(t)\in H^*(BG)[t]$. Each fake representation is the restriction of a virtual representation of $G$, but not usually a genuine representation of $G$. If a genuine representation $V$ can be decomposed nontrivially as a sum of fake representations, then we get a factorisation of $f_V(t)$, showing that $H^*_G(PV)$ is not a domain. I think it is almost always possible to find such a fake decomposition. To find the list of exceptions is probably an easy exercise for someone more fluent in Lie theory than I am. 

If I understand your question correctly then the answer is negative. Indeed, $C_2$ could be the the unit circle and $C_1$ could be a square. Now $\varphi$ has to be a conformal automorphism of $D$, and any such automorphism has the form $\varphi(z)=\lambda(z-\alpha)/(1-\overline{\alpha}z)$ for some $\alpha,\lambda$ with $|\alpha|<1$ and $|\lambda|=1$. In particular, $\varphi$ is a Mobius map and so sends circles to circles and non-circles to non-circles. In particular, it does not send $C_1$ to a circle, and so does not send the original region $\Omega$ to an annulus. 

First, if I understand your conventions correctly, the thing that you are interested in can be described as $\text{Map}_P(X,Y)$, where $P=C_G(g)$ and $X=G/H$ (considered as a $P$-space by left multiplication) and $Y$ is some other $P$-space. In this level of generality, I do not think that you gain anything from the fact that $P$ is the centraliser of a torsion element and that $X$ arises as $G/H$. If you have a particular choice of $G$, $H$, $g$ and $Y$ in mind, then it might be possible to say something specific. If not, then you are just left with methods that apply to $\text{Map}_P(X,Y)$ for any compact Lie group $P$, and any $P$-spaces $X$ and $Y$. Two questions which might be relevant: 

I believe that the first three of these are available in homotopy type theory, but the last is not. However, one only needs some specific cases of the Whitehead theorem, and these may hold even if the general result does not. 

I'll assume you want the convention where $M_f$ is $(X\times I)\cup Y$ with $(x,0)$ attached to $f(x)$. Now $M_f\times I=(X\times I^2)\cup(Y\times I)$ with $(x,0,t)$ attached to $(f(x),t)$. We want to retract this onto the space $$ Q=(M_f\times\{0\})\cup(((X\times\{1\})\cup Y)\times I) $$ Note that $X\times\{0\}\times I$ gets identified with part of $Y\times I$ and so is contained in $Q$. Thus $Q=(X\times U)\cup(Y\times I)$, where $$ U=(\{0,1\}\times I)\cup (I\times\{0\}), $$ and again $(x,0,t)$ is attached to $(f(x),t)$. Now let $r$ be a retraction from $I\times I$ onto $U$, say by radial projection from the point $(1/2,1)$. We can then fit $1\times r:X\times I^2\to X\times U$ together with the identity map on $Y\times I$ to get the required retraction of $M_f\times I$ onto $Q$. 

Suppose we have $F$ such that $H\wedge F=0$. We need to show that $H\vee F$ has Bousfield class smaller than that of $S$, or in other words, that there exists $X\neq 0$ with $H\wedge X=0$ and $F\wedge X=0$. I claim that we can take $X=I$ (the Brown-Comenetz dual of the sphere, which is the standard counterexample for everything in this theory). Indeed, we have $\pi_k(I)=0$ for $k>0$, so we can write $I$ as the colimit of its Postnikov pieces $I[-n,0]$. Here $I[0,0]$ is an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum, as are the fibres of the maps $I[-n,0]\to I[-n-1,0]$, so $F\wedge I[-n,0]=0$ for all $n$ by induction, so $F\wedge I=0$. It is also true that $H\wedge I=0$. This is Corollary B.12 in the memoir 'Morava K-theories and localisation' by Mark Hovey and myself; the proof is a fairly straightforward deduction from the fact that $[BP/p,S]_*=0$, which is contained in Ravenel's Lemma 3.2. 

It will make no difference if you define $\Delta^n$ in such a way that $c=0$. In that case it is not hard to see that any isometric embedding is linear, so $M=O(n)$. It follows that $M/\sim=O(n)/\Sigma_{n+1}=SO(n)/A_{n+1}$. We therefore have a Serre spectral sequence $$ H^i(A_{n+1};H^j(SO(n);\mathbb{Z}/2)) \Longrightarrow H^{i+j}(M/\sim;\mathbb{Z}/2). $$ In principle, the $E^2$ term involves the group cohomology of $H^*(SO(n))$ as a module over $A_{n+1}$. However, given any $g\in A_{n+1}$ we can choose a path in $SO(n)$ connecting $g$ to $1$, and it follows that the action of $g$ on $SO(n)$ is homotopic to the identity, and so acts as the identity on cohomology. Thus, the $E^2$ term can be rewritten as $$ H^i(A_{n+1};\mathbb{Z}/2) \otimes H^j(SO(n);\mathbb{Z}/2). $$ The mod $2$ cohomology groups of $SO(n)$ and $\Sigma_{n+1}$ are well known, although those of $\Sigma_{n+1}$ are complicated. It should not be hard to deduce the cohomology groups of $A_{n+1}$. However, I would guess that there are many differentials in the spectral sequence unless $n$ is very small. 

Another kind of answer involves the EHP sequence. If $\pi_n^k=\pi_n(S^k)/\text{odd torsion}$, then there are exact sequences $$ \pi_{n+2}^{2k+1}\xrightarrow{P}\pi_n^k \xrightarrow{E} \pi_{n+1}^{k+1} \xrightarrow{H} \pi_{n+1}^{2k+1} \xrightarrow{P} \pi_{n-1}^k. $$ (These are homomorphisms of abelian groups, except that when $n=k=0$ the map $H$ is the self-map of $\pi_1^1=\mathbb{Z}$ given by $m\mapsto m(m-1)/2$.) We also have the "boundary conditions" that $\pi_n^k=0$ for $n<k$, or for $n>1$ when $k=1$, and the fact that $HPE^2$ is multiplication by $2$ on the group $\pi_{4n-1}^{4n-1}=\mathbb{Z}$. This provides a rather intricate pattern of connections between all the groups. You can try to write down a system of groups and homomorphisms satisfying these conditions, without worrying about whether they are actually the same as the real homotopy groups of spheres, and you will find that it quickly gets very complicated. There are two partial solutions that can be written down explicitly. The groups $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\pi^n_k$ are known: there is a copy of $\mathbb{Q}$ for $(n,k)=(i,i)$ or $(4i-1,2i)$, and everything else is zero. It is easy to write down the maps $E$, $H$ and $P$ in this context and to check that everything is exact. There is a version of the $\Lambda$ algebra that is a relatively simple structure with properties similar to those specified above, but it has $P=0$ and each group $\Lambda_n^k$ is an infinitely generated $\mathbb{Z}/2$-module. (The $\Lambda$-algebra also has a differential, and it can be regarded as the $E_1$ page of an unstable Adams spectral sequence converging to $\pi_*^*$.) I do not know any direct construction of a system of finitely generated abelian groups and homomorphisms with the required properties, and I do not think that anyone else does either. My guess is that any such system is of similar complexity to the homotopy groups of spheres. Here is another interesting fact that sheds some light on this circle of ideas. Suppose we have systems $A_*^*$ and $B_*^*$ as above, and a morphism $f\colon A\to B$ that is compatible with $E$, $H$ and $P$, such that $f\colon A_1^1\to B_1^1$ is an isomorphism. One can then show that $f$ is an isomorphism in all bidegrees. This is another illustration of how tightly everything is linked together by the EHP sequence. 

The normal bundle to $\mathbb{C}P^1\simeq S^2$ in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ is the dual of the tautological bundle. This is nontrivial (even as a real bundle rather than a complex bundle); indeed, we have $H^*(\mathbb{C}P^1;\mathbb{Z}/2)=\mathbb{Z}/2[x]/x^2$, where $|x|=2$ and $x$ is the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the bundle in question. Also, to expand on Tom Goodwillie's comment, every vector bundle is a normal bundle. In more detail, if $V$ is a vector bundle over a manifold $M$, then we can identify $M$ with the zero section in the total space $EV$, and then the normal bundle to $M$ in $EV$ is just $V$. If you prefer to work with compact manifolds, you can choose an inner product on $V$, and put $$ P=\{(x,t,v) : x\in M, t\in\mathbb{R}, v\in V_x, t^2+\|v\|^2=1\} $$ (the unit sphere bundle in $\mathbb{R}\oplus V$). We have an embedding $i:M\to P$ given by $i(x)=(x,1,0)$, and it is not hard to see that the normal bundle is $V$. Equivalently, $P$ is the fibrewise one-point compactification of $V$. 

$\require{AMScd}$ First, suppose that $G$ acts freely on connected spaces $X$ and $Y$, and that $p\colon X\to Y$ is $G$-equivariant. We then have a diagram of fibrations \begin{CD} X @>>> X/G @>>> BG \\ @VpVV @VVV @VV1V \\ Y @>>> Y/G @>>> BG \end{CD} This gives a diagram of fundamental groups \begin{CD} \pi_1(X) @>>> \pi_1(X/G) @>>> G \\ @Vp_*VV @VVV @VV1V \\ \pi_1(Y) @>>> \pi_1(Y/G) @>>> G \end{CD} and it is not hard to see that the rows are short exact sequences. Now specialise to the case where $Y=\mathbb{C}^\times$ and $G=C_3$ acting by rotation, and $\pi_1(X)$ is finite. Using the top row we see that $\pi_1(X/G)$ is also finite, so the only homomorphism to $\mathbb{Z}$ is trivial. On the other hand, bottom row is then $\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{3}\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}/3$, and this quickly leads to a contradiction. Now suppose that $f\colon S^2\to\mathbb{C}$ is a counterexample to the OP's question. Fix three points $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ equally spaced on a great circle. Let $R$ be the rotation that sends $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ to $x_2$, $x_3$ and $x_1$. Define $p\colon SO(3)\to \mathbb{C}^\times$ by $$ p(T) = f(Tx_1) + \omega f(Tx_2) + \omega^2 f(Tx_3), $$ and note that this satisfies $g(TR)=\omega^{-1}g(T)$. In other words, if we let $C_3$ act on $SO(3)$ using $R$ and on $\mathbb{C}^\times$ by $\omega^{-1}$, we see that $p$ is equivariant. This is impossible by our initial lemma, because $\pi_1(SO(3))=\mathbb{Z}/2$. All the above still works if we replace $3$ by another integer $n>1$. 

As Sean says, the key point is the Universal Coefficient Theorem, but the details are not completely obvious unless you make some finiteness assumptions. Suppose that $f:X\to Y$ is such that $H^{\ast}(f;\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism. Let $Z$ be the cofibre of $f$, so $\tilde{H}^{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z})=0$. If we can prove that $\tilde{H}_{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z})=0$ then we can appeal to the ordinary homological Whitehead theorem. MathJax is mangling my tildes: all (co)homology groups of $Z$ below should be read as reduced. For any prime $p$, we have a universal coefficient sequence for $H^{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ in terms of $H^{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z})$, so $H^{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z}/p)=0$. As ${\mathbb{Z}/p}$ is a field we also know that $H_{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is a free module with $H^{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ as its dual, so we must have $H_{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z}/p)=0$. Using the universal coefficient theorem for homology we deduce that $H_{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z})/p$ and $\text{ann}(p,H_{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z}))$ are zero, so multiplication by $p$ is an isomorphism on $H_{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z})$. As this holds for all $p$, we see that $H_{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z})$ is a rational vector space. Thus, if it is nontrivial it will contain a copy of $\mathbb{Q}$ so (via universal coefficients again) $H^{\ast}(Z;\mathbb{Z})$ will contain a copy of $\text{Ext}(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{Z})$. This group is nonzero (in fact, enormous) by a standard calculation, so this contradicts the initial assumption. 

If you restrict attention to separable extensions then the picture is as follows. Let $\overline{k}$ be a separable closure of $k$ with Galois group $G$. If $X$ is a finite $G$-set we have a $k$-algebra $A(X)=\text{Map}_G(X,\overline{k})$. This construction gives an equivalence from the category of finite $G$-sets to the category of finite etale $k$-algebras. The finite separable extensions of $k$ just correspond to the $G$-sets on $X$ which $G$ acts transitively (so $X\simeq G/H$ for some $H$, and $A(X)=\overline{k}^H$). We can decompose any $X$ as a disjoint union of transitive $G$-sets, and this writes $A(X)$ as a product of fields. We also have $A(X)\otimes_kA(Y)=A(X\times Y)$. Thus, if $K=\overline{k}^H=A(G/H)$ then we can decompose $K\otimes_kK$ as a product of fields by decomposing $(G/H)\times(G/H)$ as a disjoint union of orbits. On the other hand, you can consider $k=(\mathbb{Z}/p)(x_1,\dotsc,x_r)$ and define an inseparable field extension $K$ by adjoining $y_i$ with $y_i^p=x_i$ for all $i$. Then $K\otimes_kK$ is generated over $K$ by classes $z_i$ satisfying $z_i^p=x_i$, so the classes $u_i=z_i-y_i$ have $u_i^p=0$. It is not hard to see that $K\otimes_kK$ is just the truncated polynomial algebra generated by $u_1,\dotsc,u_r$ subject to $u_i^p=0$. My guess is that you can't get anything much more complicated than that. [ADDED LATER] A commutative finite-dimensional $k$-algebra $A$ is self-injective iff Gorenstein iff $\text{Hom}_k(A,k)$ is isomorphic to $A$ as an $A$-module. There are very many of these. If $(r_1,\dotsc,r_n)$ is any regular sequence in $k[x_1,\dotsc,x_n]$ then the quotient ring $Q=k[x_1,\dotsc,x_n]/(r_1,\dotsc,r_n)$ has this property. The cohomology ring of any closed manifold (with coefficients in $k$) has this property. One small example is $k[x,y]/(x^3,y^2+xy+x^2)$. 

Put $A=\mathbb{Z}_p[\zeta]$ and $\pi=\zeta-1$. Then $$ A/\pi=\mathbb{Z}_p[x]/(\Phi_p(x),x-1)= (\mathbb{Z}_p[x]/(x-1))/\Phi_p(x) = \mathbb{Z}_p/\Phi_p(1) = \mathbb{Z}/p. $$ This is a field, so $\pi$ generates a maximal ideal. Now suppose that $u$ lies outside this maximal ideal. Let $v$ be a lift in $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ of the image of $u$ in $A/\pi=\mathbb{Z}/p$, so $u=v(1-a\pi)$ for some $a\in A$. As $p$-th powers are additive mod $p$, in $A/p$ we have $\pi^p=\zeta^p-1=0$. This means that $\pi^p$ is divisible by $p$, so the series $\sum_i(a\pi)^i$ converges $p$-adically to an inverse for $1-a\pi$, and we deduce that $u$ is also invertible in $A$. As $A\pi$ is an ideal such that $A\setminus A\pi$ consists of units, we see that it is the unique maximal ideal, so $A$ is local. 

Most of this is just the octahedral axiom for triangulated categories. It would be painful to typeset it in MathJax, but the axiom gives you an octahedral diagram in which four triangular faces are distinguished triangles and the other four faces are commutative. Four of the edges are your $\alpha,\dotsc,\delta$, and the others are just inclusions $V_i\to V_j$ or projections $V_j\to V_j/V_i$ or the obvious maps $V_1/V_0\to V_2/V_0\to V_2/V_1$. You might want more than what the octahedral axiom gives you, but even if that is the case, I think that you should explain what you want with reference to the octahedral axiom.
