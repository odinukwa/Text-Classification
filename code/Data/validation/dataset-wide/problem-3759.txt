Unfortunately, the answer is negative in the general case! Counterexamples can be easily constructed in the following way: 

carrying on the idea of merging two quadrangles of a quadrangulation and then reinserting a randomly chosen diagonal of the hexagon, I had the following idea, that is aimed at easy implementation: create a planar graph that, up to a few exceptions, consists only of hexagons, e.g. 

I don't know, whether this is an already known algorithm and I also don't know how optimal the resulting partioning will be, but its description and implementation are simple: 

squaring a function to find its zeroes is generally no good idea; first you can't exploit sign changes of the function values to conclude that a certain intervall must contain a zero (or discontinuity with sign change for left and right limit); another problem is that numeric precision gets worse because the slopes vanish at the zeros of the squared function. Worst case scenario is that a sign transition may not result in a zero of the squared function, e.g. $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} -\sqrt{-(x-0.5)}, & x < 0.5 \\ +\sqrt{+(x-0.5)}+2k, & x \ge 0.5 \end{cases} $$ squaring yields $$ (f(x)-k)^2=abs(x-0.5)+k $$ the original transition from $0$ to $2k$ doesn't generate a zero and applying a derivative-based method like Newton-Raphson produces a ping pong between $0.5-k$ and $0.5+k$. The Numerical Recipes book is probably the best resource to recommend to you. 

Here is what I could piece together from what is available online and some ruminations of my own: The edgeset $E$ of a Halin graph $H(V,E),\ deg(v\in V)\ \ge 3,$ can be decomposed into two disjoint sets $T$ and $C$, where $T\cup V$ constitutes to a spanning tree of $H$ and $C\cup \lbrace v\in adj(C)\rbrace$ is a simple cycle through all and only the leafnodes of the spanning tree. Among the interesting properties of Halin graphs are: 

One can see that $p(G)=k/n$, where $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $n$-cycles, so the answer is YES if $n$ is prime. Numerical testing shows the answer is YES for $n\leq 30$ and for primitive groups for $n\leq 1000$. There are non-cyclic groups achieving the bound $\varphi(n)/n$, e.g., the wreath product of cyclic groups. 

Let $N(x)$ be the number of positive integers $n\leq x$ such that $\gcd(n,\phi(n))=1$. Here $\phi(n)$ is the Euler totient function. A theorem of Erdos from 1948 says that $$ N(x) \sim \frac{e^{-C_0} x}{\log\log\log x},\quad x\to \infty, $$ where $C_0$ is the Euler constant. See also Theorem 11.23 in Montgomery-Vaughan's "Multiplicative number theory". Erdos quotes a result of Szele saying that these numbers are exactly those $n$ for which there is exactly one abstract group of order $n$. My question is whether there is a deeper, or more enlightening, reason to count such integers? 

Let me start by rigorously pose my question. Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$, let $n$ be an even integer number, let $f(X) = X^n + T_1 X^{n-1} + \cdots + T_n$, be the generic polynomial, that is, $T = (T_1, \ldots, T_n)$ is a tuple of algebraically independent variables over $K$. Let $\Omega = $ { $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_m$} be a finite subset of $K$, let $f_i(X) = f(X) - \omega_i$, and let $F_i$ be the splitting field of $f_i$ over $K(T)$ ($i=1,\ldots, m$). Question: For which $\Omega$ the splitting fields $F_1, \ldots, F_m$ are linearly disjoint over $K(T)$? Remarks: 

Landau proved that the mean density of integers of the form $a^2+b^2$ up to $x$ is $K\frac{x}{\sqrt{\log x}} (1+o(1))$, where $K$ is an explicit constant. One proof is based on the fact that a prime $p$ is of this form iff $p\neq 3\mod 4$, and so we can express the generating function for these integers in terms of the zeta function and the $L$-function of the non-trivial character modulo $4$. From there one proceed using complex analysis. For integers of the form $a^2 + nb^2$, one should have similar results. We know what primes has this form by class field theory, and then in principle one can continue as before. I am sure this is classical, but unfortunately I've failed to find it in the literature (including google). Does anyone know a reference for this? 

I agree with Hailong, you want to look at Fano schemes. Here's an article by Debarre and Manivel. It's very good, and I've gotten a lot out of it despite note knowing much French. 

Here's something that's been bothering me, and that's come up again for me recently while reading some stuff about Hilbert schemes of points (Nakajima's lectures, specifically): Let $C$ be an algebraic curve. Define $S^nC$ to be $C\times\ldots\times C/S_n$, the symmetric power. Now, over $\mathbb{C}$, I can show that $C$ a complex manifold implies that $S^nC$ is, and that if $X$ is a variety with $S^nX$ smooth, then $X$ is one dimensional, but the argument I have involves looking in analytic open sets and reducing to the case of $\mathbb{C}^n$, and additionally is fairly unhelpful for identifying the total space (ie, that $S^n\mathbb{P}^1\cong\mathbb{P}^n$) So here's my question: how can we, in a fairly quick and natural way, show that 

Ok. Concrete. A morphism of projective (quasi-projective) varieties f:V->W can be described by taking V and W, embedding them into projective spaces, and then f will be a collection of homogeneous rational functions, all of the same degree, such that the image of V is contained in W. The intuition here is that we're looking at algebraic maps of algebraic objects. Naturally, this is a bad way to do things from a modern perspective, but you said you wanted concrete. So as for motivating examples, take any rationally parameterized anything in projective space, and it's a morphism from some open subset of another projective space (where the rational functions are all defined). 

We can show that (1) the abelianizations of $H$ and $K$ are isomorphic (2) $H/M_S(H)\cong K/M_S(K)$, where $S$ is a non-abelian finite simple group and for a group $G$, $M_S(G)$ is the intersection of all normal subgroups $U$ with $G/U\cong S$; so $G/M_S(G)$ is the maximal quotient of the form $S\times \cdots \times S$. 

In fact, $H^1(K,M)$ is infinite not only to the family of number fields, but also to the more general family of Hilbertian fields (those fields which satisfies the Hilbert irreducibility theorem). Below is a proof based on embedding problems: Let $K$ be Hilbertian with absolute Galois group $G_K$ and $M$ a finite nontrivial $G_K$module. A finite embedding problem for a field $K$ is a pair of two epimorphisms (all morphisms in this answer are assumed to continuous) $$ \mathcal{E}=(\alpha\colon G_K\to G ; \beta \colon \Gamma\to G) $$ with $\Gamma$ finite. A solution of $\mathcal{E}$, in this answer, is an epimorphism $\psi\colon G_K \to \Gamma$ with $\alpha = \beta\circ \psi$. If $M$ is a finite $G_K$-module, then from continuity of the action, there exists an open subgroup $U$ of $G_K$ that acts trivially on $M$, and so the action factors through $G:=G_K/U$; let $\alpha\colon G_K\to G$ be the quotient map. Then, we have the semi-direct product $\Gamma = M\rtimes G$ and the projection map $\beta\colon \Gamma\to G$, which form the embedding problem $$ (1)\qquad \mathcal{E}=(\alpha\colon G_K \to G,\beta\colon \Gamma\to G), \qquad \Gamma =M\rtimes G, $$ We note that $\mathcal{E}$ is split in the sense that $\beta$ has a group theoretical section and $\mathcal{E}$ has an abelian kernel in the sense that $M = \ker\beta$ is abelian. In a similar fashion, for any $n>0$, we may construct the embedding problem $$ \mathcal{E}_n = (\alpha\colon G_K ; \beta_n \colon \Gamma_n \to G), $$ where $\Gamma_n = M^n\rtimes G$ and $\beta_n$ is the quotient map. To be precise, here $G$ acts on $M^n$ coordinate-wise; i.e., $g.(m_1,\ldots, m_n) := (g.m_1,\ldots, g.m_n)$. Theorem (Ikeda, [Fried-Jarden, Field Arithmetic 2nd edtn, Prop. 16.4.5]) If $K$ is Hilbertian, then any split embedding problem with abelian kernel has a solution; in particular, $\mathcal{E}_n$ has a solution $\Psi \colon G_K\to \Gamma_n$. We note that $\Psi$ gives rise to $n$ distinct solutions of $\mathcal{E}$: Proposition Under the notation above, let $\pi_i\colon \Gamma_n\to \Gamma$ be the projection map given by $\pi_i((m_1,\ldots,m_n)g) = (m_i,g)$. Then, a) $\psi_i = \pi_i\circ \Psi$ is a solution of $\mathcal{E}$. b) For all $i\neq j$ one has $\ker \psi_i \ker \psi_j = \ker \alpha$, and, in particular, if $M\neq 0$, then $\ker \psi_i\neq \ker \psi_j$. Proof. a) is immediate. For b), put $M'_i = \ker \pi$, so $M'_i = \{(m_1,\ldots, m_n)\in M^n : m_i=0\}$. Then if $i\neq j$, then \begin{equation}\label{eq:EQ} (2) \qquad M_i'M_j'=M^n. \end{equation} Note that we have $$ (3) \Psi^{-1}(M_i') =\ker \psi_i \quad \mbox{and} \quad \Psi^{-1}(M^n) = \Psi^{-1}(\ker\beta_n) = \ker (\beta_n\circ \Psi) = \ker \alpha, $$ Since $\Psi\colon G_K\to \Gamma_n$ is surjective, it induces a bijection between subgroups of $G_K$ containing $\ker \Psi$ and subgroups of $\Gamma_n$; namely, $H\leq \Gamma_n$ corresponds to $\Psi^{-1}(H)$. So (2) and (3) give that $$(4)\qquad \ker \psi_i \ker \psi_j = \ker \alpha. $$ If $M\neq 0$, then $M_i'\neq M^n$, and so $\ker \psi_i\lneq \ker\alpha$. Thus, (4) implies that $\ker\psi_i\neq \ker\psi_j$, and in particular $\psi_i\neq \psi_j$. QED Corollary If $M\neq 0$, then the embedding problem $\mathcal{E}$ given in (1) has infinitely many solutions. Each solution $\psi$ of $\mathcal{E}$ given in (1) induces a $1$-cocyle in $c\in H^1(K,M)$. Indeed, $c$ is defined by $$ \psi(g) = (c(g),\alpha(g))\in \Gamma $$ (recall that $G=G_K/U$ and $\alpha\colon G_K\to G$ is the quotient map) or equivalently by $$ c(g) = \psi(g) \alpha(g)^{-1}. $$ Obviously, these formulas imply that the map from solutions to cocycles is injective, and so the Corollary gives infinitely many cocycles, and so $H^1(K,M)$ is also infinite. 

To me, at least, this is a manifestation of the fact that for homogeneous polynomials, we have $\frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=0}^n x_i\partial_i f=f$. The map $O(1)^{n+1}\to T$ tells you that every vector field is a linear combination of the $\partial_i$ with linear coefficients. The map $O\to O(1)^{n+1}$ sends the section 1 to the vector $(x_0,\ldots,x_n)$, which says that the vector field $\frac{1}{d}\sum x_i\partial_i$ acts trivially on functions. Thus, the quotient must be the actual tangent vector fields, giving us the tangent bundle. EDIT: Apparently this package doesn't know mathscr. Have made it readable. 

I've been told many times that the Torelli map $J:\mathcal{M}_g\to \mathcal{A}_g$ for ($g\geq 2$, and at least on the level of coarse moduli spaces, over $\mathbb{C}$) gives an isomorphism of Picard groups. On the level of rational picard groups, they're both generated by the determinant of the Hodge bundle, but why is this true on the nose? I'll be more than happy with a proof or with a reference to a detailed proof (actually slightly prefer the latter). 

There is a map $d\log:H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X^\times)\to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1)$ taking a line bundle to it's Chern class (at least, when everything is over $\mathbb{C}$, I believe this works). An ample class is then the Chern class of an ample line bundle. 

Let $C$ be a curve. Then I know of two ways to create morphisms. To get morphisms from $C$, take a line bundle of any degree $L$ and use the linear system it determines to get a map into projective space, which may or may not be injective, so you get a map to another curve. To get a morphism to $C$, a particular case is to take a line bundle $\mu$ of order 2, which gives us a curve $\tilde{C}$ as a double cover of $C$. How do these two methods interact? For instance, given a curve $C$, and the tower $\tilde{C}\to C\to \bar{C}$ with the first map given as a double cover by $\mu$, and the second map given by a line bundle $L$, presumably the geometry of this tower is connected to the line bundle $L\otimes\mu$, but it's not obvious to me how to connect the two notions to get any actual information. 

The degree of the minimal polynomial of your cos is bounded below by phi(n)/2 since it generates a real field inside the cyclotomic field. If phi(n)/2 is bigger than 8 you are done. For small n you can check one by one with computer (or write the minimal polynomial and see it doesn’t divide that polynomial or compute discriminant, which is an easy thing for cosine as the real part of a root of unity) 

Motivation: The linear disjointness of the splitting fields allows one to calculate a Galois group of a composite of polynomials, which in turn yields arithmetic features of the ring of polynomials over large finite fields. Let me not elaborate on that here 

Theorem: Every bounded differential function $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is constant. Proof. By assumption there exist real numbers $M,N$ such that $$N\leq f(x) \leq M.$$ Taking derivatives we get $$0\leq f'(x)\leq 0.$$ Hence $f'(x)=0$ so $f$ is constant. QED 

If C is a family of finite groups that is closed to taking quotients, normal subgroups, and extensions, then the free group on two generators embeds into the pro-C completion. Such C's can be the finite p-groups or the finite solvable groups, and others. See, e.g., Fried-Jarden's Field Arithmetic, Prop. 17.5.11, for a proof. 

Let $G$ be a degree $n$ group, i.e., a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$. Let $p(G)$ be the number of $n$-cycles in $G$ divided by the size of $G$. Examples: 

If $G$ is a cyclic transitive group, then $p=\varphi(n)/n$. If $G=S_n$, then $p=1/n$. (If $G$ is not transitive, then $p=0$)
