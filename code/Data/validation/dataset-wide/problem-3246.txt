A good definition of history that historians use is 'History is the study of change over time.' Historical studies, to a large extent, rely on theory and methodology. A series of facts is a narrative, it is not a historical study. Analyzing those facts, placing them into context, understanding the underlying factors that contributed to those facts occurring, all of that and then some is encompassed by the study of 'history.' Furthermore, history is very much interdisciplinary. Various graduate programs in history will encourage students to take classes in other disciplines (anthropology is a perfect example) and incorporate what they learn outside the field into their dissertation, articles, reviews, books, etc. Historians usually have to become immersed in the subjects they study. Thus economic historians have to have a general and at times detailed understanding of economics that's relative to the time period and location they specialize in. The same applies to politics, labor, medicine, technology, philosophy, warfare, etc. I can't comment on what those outside the discipline of history do, but I can say that 'outsiders' who try to write about history usually fail in that they do not understand how to incorporate either theory or methodology. What readers are left with are either popular histories that add nothing new to the canon or failed attempts to discuss historical subjects/ideas. 

"In hoc signo vinces" is Eusebius' Latin translation of the Greek "writing" "(ἐν) τούτῳ νίκα" that (reputedly) appeared in the sky alongside the sign itself. ("Reputedly" because the whole affair wasn't mentioned by Eusebius until after Constantine's death, and I am generally highly sceptical of "signs" appearing.) 

Mention was made in comments of the German DIN 1355 (1943) and DIN 1355-1 (1975), the former identifying the beginning of the week as "Sunday 0:00" and the latter identifying Monday as the first day of the week. This would bracket the "when" of the change, for Germany at least, as "sometime between 1943 and 1975". 

That kind of imagery is violating the Jewish / Christian first commandment, something that their god did not look kindly upon (you might remember that episode with the golden calf). 

Because interracial marriage and intimate relationships were still illegal in several US states at the time, including the state of Virgina, where the movie is taking place, at the time it is taking place. The couple got married in Washington D.C., where such marriage was legal. (Traveling there from their Virginia residence for the sake of marriage, and then back to Virginia, was not legal according to Section 20-58 of the Virginia Code.) The prominent display of the certificate could have been an act of pride, defiance, or assertion. They did not "have to" display it that way by any Virginia law, as the marriage itself was not considered legal by Virginia authorities anyway. Actually, there is a Wikipedia article about that couple's court case that eventually led to overturning the last of those laws as the Supreme Court considered such laws as unconstitutional. 

Professional historians would never attribute something as complex as the development and unfolding of the Second World War in Europe to 'kill ratios'. That's history in a vacuum since you're leaving out all other aspects of the war and concentrating on pure ratios and math, thus leaving out context. 'Kill ratios' are in effect a reflection and form part of the result(s) of what historians study, research, and write about, they are not the main theme or area of concentration. 

There are some things you can be sure about and some that you will never know for 100% are true/false/accurate. Facts throughout history are easier to understand and list, such as dates, people, events, etc. We know they happened, especially within the past 100 years when the world has been exposed to photographs and television. The bigger issue is understanding the underlying context and analysis. Why did things happen is something that we will never know for 100%. That is why so many controversies and debates exist within history, because you can have a hundred historians studying the same subject and looking at the same sources and they'll come away with 100, or more, different interpretations based on their own specialization, understanding, background, interest, and knowledge base. There is no absolute way of avoiding misinformation because for that you'll have to look at all the information the historian or author you're reading looked through, and that's impossible. And if somehow that were possible, your interpretation might easily differ from that of someone else. But that doesn't mean either of you is wrong, it simply means the world is not black and white and events unfold due to so many reasons and factors that it is truly impossible for any one person or one study to objectively encompass them all. 

Note that the linked articles (dated 2012) state the Jiangxi finding to be noteworthy, because previous findings date to about 10,000 BCE, i.e. after the invention of agriculture. 

A more likely reason than these technical issues, though, was the inertia of the North American market. Being far remote from Germany and the fractured European market (with its needs for standardization), and not having adopted the metric system either, it probably seemed easier all-around to stick with the existing inch-based formats. In Germany alone three different basic sizes were used for letters -- Reichsformat (33x42cm), Super-Royal (50x68cm), and Groß Patria (36x43cm). People were facing problems with ill-fitting envelopes, binders, and boxes, so the pressure for standardization was there before even considering the formats used in neighboring countries.[source] 

The whole range of ISO sizes uses the side ratio (1 : 1,414), with the base A0 size being defined as having an area of one square meter. The constant side ratio (1 : 1,414) was already mentioned by Lichtenberg (1786), and used during the French Revolution ("Loi sur le Timbre"). Reinvented with the "Weltformat" by Ostwald (1910), his assistant Porstmann came up with the square meter base sheet (A0) and the B series for envelopes (1922). The German Wikipedia entry on "Paper sizes" has some of the criticisms voiced about this format. Quoting from there, translation mine: 

All three had specific reasons for appearing in military uniforms if and when they did (keep in mind that they did not regularly or always wear them). Stalin utilized the victory in the Great Patriotic War to establish his demi-God status throughout the Soviet Union and portray his actions in the 1930s as necessary for the war's outcome. He used the war as a tool and himself, or rather the idea of 'Stalin', as the ultimate genius behind the victory over Nazi Germany. Khrushchev allied himself with the likes of Zhukov when he was attempting to take over after Stalin. It was under Khrushchev that the first military memoirs about the war were published (Stalin refused to allow much to be written about the war for fear of anyone asking the wrong questions). Khrushchev was a commissar but never really held any position of importance. Finally, Brezhnev jumped on the 'War Cult' bandwagon because he tried to use the war to excuse previous failures and attempted to utilize the deeds of that generation to inspire the current and future generation(s) by having veterans visit schools to talk with students, by making May 9 a national holiday (it took 20 years for that to happen), etc. He was also a commissar during the war, lower ranking than Khrushchev, and his claim to fame was 'Malaia Zemlia'. This was an operation in the latter part of the war where a diversionary operation was so successful that the main operation was called off and all the forces earmarked for the main offensive were instead switched over to Malaia Zemlia (it was an attempt to liberate Novorossiisk in 1943). Brezhnev never played an important role, but if you look at the literature from the time period, he was apparently pretty damn important. And in that picture, you can see that he was only one of 4 people in the entire Soviet Union to receive the coveted 'Hero of the Soviet Union' Gold Star three times (the other three were Zhukov and two of the highest scoring aces in the Soviet Air Force). 

Right after that paragraph, he goes on (in his usual, rambling, all-over-the-place style) about how only Italy and England (!) would provide worthwhile alliances, and how an alliance with England would isolate France. 

"The Großdeutsche Reich in its final form will encompass not only people who are sympathetic towards the Reich from the get-go. Beyond the core of the Reich it is therefore necessary to create a Staatstruppenpolizei, which is able to represent and enforce the authority of the Reich in the interior in any situation." "Staatstruppenpolizei" means something along the lines of "armed state police". You might see a pattern here. The purpose of the Waffen-SS was political loyalty more than military might. During the invasions of Poland and France the Waffen-SS was mostly employed behind the frontlines, for "pacifying and clean-up operations". You can imagine what that entailed. Where the Waffen-SS was actually engaging in combat (not yet as individual units but as regiments embedded in the army), they performed poorly in these campaigns (at least in the eyes of the Wehrmacht commanders). One of the reasons was the comparatively poor military training. They did receive preferential equipment and supplies, though, and of course loyalty and enthusiasm of the volunteers accounted for something, so in the end casualties of Waffen-SS and regular Wehrmacht forces were more or less equal. That being despite e.g. officers being rotated between frontline units, SS bureaus, training units, and concentration camps. (It turned out that both KZ guards and KZ officers performed very poorly in actual combat...) So, while Himmler considered and wished the Waffen-SS to be an elite force, and the propaganda certainly touted it as such, it was not actually created or trained as such. The focus was very much on ideology, loyalty, and fanatism, with military expertise being almost an afterthought. 

No. Knowing how 'close' they were would mean knowing what variables would be needed to bring them over into collapsing. Only conjecture exists in the form of taking Moscow in 1941 or the Caucasus in 1942. Comparable is the idea that the Germans were defeated before the war even began due to their lack of planning and foresight, as well as their failure of securing the encirclement at Smolensk spelled their eventual defeat. 

Whether or not they were dictators is a separate question and one that does not necessarily relate to what they should or would wear. 

This is a very hard question to answer for numerous reasons and one that will never be answered to everyone's satisfaction. Here are some things to consider and some problems that frequently come up when you're dealing with Lend Lease. First off, significant Lend Lease aid was not felt until 1943. The Lend Lease that arrived before was nowhere near enough to make a decisive difference on how 1941 and 1942 turned out. There are some articles/arguments that have recently come out which attempt to argue that the Lend Lease tanks that did make it in 1941 played a decisive role in the defense of Moscow, but I don't believe they are conclusive enough (see the following article: British “Lend-Lease” Tanks and the Battle for Moscow, November–December 1941—A Research Note). Secondly, the immediate problems that come up when attempting to qualify Lend Lease are the following. Just quoting numbers of what was sent is not enough. One needs to account for what was sent, when it arrived (and how much arrived), and when it was actually incorporated into the Red Army and used in the field. Additionally, one has to keep in mind that the Soviets began to scale back production of certain things because they knew they would receive them through Lend Lease. One example is trucks. The Soviets were producing practically none because they knew to expect them through Lend Lease, but that doesn't mean they couldn't produce more if they needed to. Many former truck producing factories were switched over to light tank production. Since the Red Army moved to relying on medium and heavy tanks, light tanks were something the Red Army could in theory do without or with less of. This type of analysis needs to be applied to everything the Soviet Union received. Specifically, what they received, if it was not coming through Lend Lease what were the alternatives? Meaning could they produce it internally or import it from another state/country (England, Canada, etc.). The Soviet Union did not just receive Lend Lease from the US. Finally, the Soviet Union participated in reverse Lend Lease, sending back materials to the US. All of the above is just the tip of the huge iceberg that studying Lend Lease means, it's simply impossible to account for all the variables.
