I agree with IndigoFenix. Before I saw Xplodotron's answer, I could think of only one creature that has multiple mouths: Venus Flytrap. Granted, that uses the term "mouth" pretty loosely but they do trap and digest prey. They also die when they take in prey and are replaced by new traps. Also, as Xplodotron mentioned, sexual selection may allow a random mutation that does not decrease survivability too badly. A two headed snake as a pretty common mutation. If the multiple heads helped the male snake mate it might get passed on. 

Material is definitely transferred but the big question is: How much damage was done? If the damage was high enough, the material could be buried too deep to be meaningful unless you use it to explain a magical underdark. A more likely way of transferring material that would be both close to the surface and not distributed too thinly to be useful would be is a celestial body were to break up do to gravitational stresses and some pieces of it were to fall to the planet. Another reason for a break up is that maybe the planet had a moon that the celestial object hit. That would offer moon rock plus whatever was in the other rock. 

Space Cannons: either chemical or electromagnetic cannons that fire you into space. If the barrel is long enough, the acceleration will not squish you. Laser Launch: build an array of lasers that shine on a block of ice under the payload. The steam produced gives the thrust to get into orbit. Jordan Kare was a big proponent of this. Airship to Orbit: Fly the payload out on a lighter than air lifting body. John Powell Space Elevator (arguably): This isn't doable with current tech but it may or may not be too far away. According to Arthur C. Clarke, it should happen in about 30 years since people stopped laughing about it 20 years ago. 

The main pitfall here is that it is very easy to rise to power using "us vs them." Your "utopia" will last until someone figures out that they can gain power by pitting one group against another. Then, it might not be "nationalism" but only if the "them" is defined in terms other than a nation. Look at your typical high school. The kids form tribes and often harass kids from other "tribes." Anything that you are thinking of will be an unstable equilibrium that can't last without constant maintenance. 

Aside from all of the good answer given here but can you imagine trying to pull rectangles out of a pouch or pocket? The corners would catch on everything. Also, what is the coin worth if the corner broke off? 

See if she can create non sentient moving objects. If she can create a rod that spins within a stationary collar, you can power just about any industrial bit of machinery. Mount the collar on something that doesn't move and then mount something (like a mill or anything else) to the rotating rod. By using clutches and gearing you can start, stop and modify torc and speed. You could even make rudimentary automobiles by having the wheels clutch onto at rotating axle. 

Anything with thick skin. If the dogs can't damage it, they can't kill it. I also picked examples that were big enough to take out the dogs. So, for modern animals: rhino, hippo and, maybe, elephant. For extinct, recent, species, the giant sloth. 

You will need either a cultural solution or a physical solution that gives women an "impossible to ignore" advantage in combat. 

Magic is a wave form. The staff is the correct length to act as a resonance chamber and wave form guide for some useful portion of the mana spectrum. Carvings, symbols, and added bits (like crystals or feathers) change the harmonics of the mana waves in some useful way. Wands would be used for shorter wave mana. Longer wavelengths tend to have better distance and area coverage capabilities while shorter wavelengths are higher energy that work better for more focused, short range applications. 

From the outside there may be other visible effects from lensing. Like gravitational lensing, you would see things behind the fluctuation move as if a lens had appeared between you and it. The amount of movement would range from unnoticeable to giving you a headache to look at. 

Look at this example of the Ming Dynasty over on Stack Exchange's History forum. It gives several reasons why the Ming Dynasty did exactly what you are proposing. Here are some of the reasons given: 

There are many reasons to have both Drones and Missiles. This assumes that the drones cannot cause large structural damage. Thus, drones are multi shot weapons and missiles are ship killers. 1. Anti-missile. As Fhnuzoag said, drones are good for anti-missile applications as well as anti drone applications. From the way your shields work, point defense cannot fire through them. That means that point defense is probably on pylons and will get scraped off after the first "hit" (near misses will do for scraping). Drones allow you to use anti missile point defense at a distance. This thins the missile swarm so point defense does not get overwhelmed. 2. Anti anti-missile drones. Since you want your missiles to get to the target, lace the swarm with anti-drone drones. 3. Hull cleaners. If any drones from a missile swarm make it to the target, they try to get behind the shields and take out shield generators and other useful targets. 4. Anti-personnel. Why send a manned vehicle when you need to strafe a soft target that doesn't rate a missile. 

High tectonic/volcanic activity puts more gold, silver and heavy metals on the surface. As has been pointed out, life gives larger molecules of many types (hydrocarbons, proteins, medical and poisonous molecules). Water or past water gives salts and other molecules that are created when elements are dissolved in water. the presence of certain of these chemicals is why scientists are now convinced that Mars once had water. 

Look for geologic activities that concentrate the minerals. You can find veins of gold or silver (and other metals) in volcanic areas. Specifically, miners in the US northwest (I'm using Kellogg, Idaho for my example) look for quartz veins in the rock. Those veins sometimes have veins of silver running through them. The veins form from steam leaking out through cracks in the ground. The quartz gets deposited on the sides of the crack and then when the crack is narrow enough, silver is deposited until the crack closes. Once they find silver inside a quartz vein, they just dig to follow that vein. So, one place to look is where there is current or former volcanic activity. 

Does the river flood during the rainy season (even if it doesn't rain in the desert)? If so, you have the Nile. When it floods, it spreads good soil across the land around the banks which makes for good farming. That will allow for a very large population. If it doesn't flood, then there will be a narrower strip of land that they can farm (unless you allow good canal and irrigation systems). Is the river navigable? If so, you have trade of goods all up and down the river. If not, you have roads running down one or both sides of the river and trade routes will be shorter. Does the desert kingdom extend to the point where the river lets out into the sea? If so, you have a, potentially, large delta region for crops. You also have a good trade city for trade with other sea faring cultures. If not, there is probably a trade city at the farthest down flow end of the river. Don't forget the steppes. With farming near the river and herds livestock and, maybe horses, this becomes another food source. 

If the empire is on the coast of Arabia, the ocean currents run north and south from there, making travel from the capital easy. that means that response times to trouble will be faster than trouble coming to the capital. However, the biggest effect for keeping the empire together would not be in modes of travel or communication. It would be in the terrain. If different areas of the empire are cut off from each other by largely impassible terrain (jungles, deserts, huge rivers, and mountains) then the empire can stay together. The empire is not threatened by a region rebelling. The empire is threatened by a rebellion that spreads. The empire has the manpower to easily put down one region's rebellion. It would not be so easy if the empire had to spread it's forces over several regions. Having to have the ability to suppress multiple regions simultaneously would increase the necessary size of their standing army. Increasing the size of the army would increase unrest since the money to pay for the army has to come from somewhere (usually from the outlying regions). This is one of the things that killed the historic Roman Empire. If your empire somehow survived the process of getting big enough to dominate the entire continent (that's the biggest trick to explain) then, with no external threats, the army size can be much smaller. In fact, with no external threats, the regions would have no legitimate reason to have standing armies of their own. So they would have no power. In that case, if there was to be a threat to the empire, it would have to come from the capital itself. 

I think that "mid-food chain" is the lowest you can probably go. For one thing, it takes time and learning for intelligence to aid survival. It takes time for the previous generation to pass the survival knowledge on to the younger generation. I don't think that low-food chain animals would live long enough to be able to do that. In fact, the lower in the food chain you go, the more creatures seem to be adapted toward: mature quickly and breed lots. They tend to use hardwired instincts to bypass the learning curve that more intelligent creatures use. 

On any planet, you should have the building blocks for #2 and #3 types. So, the question is just how much work/energy needs to go into providing them. The #1 type are the tricky ones. If there is no tectonic activity at all, you might be SOL for those. There may be a few deposits from when the planet was still undergoing formation but you will have to find them. I recommend two parameters for your material availability: quantity and availability. Quantity is: how much is there to dig up or create. this one is pretty straight forward. Availability is: how difficult it is to mine / find / process. Maybe a 1 to 10 scale. 10 is: walk outside and pick it up off the ground. In some areas gold and diamonds like this. 9 would be: tales some work. Wood is like this. Unless you are in a desert, you can find it just about anywhere but you need to cut it down and then process it into the sizes that you need (for lumber) or into a form that will be useful (pulp for paper or charcoal). 1 would be: Yes you can do it but why? 0 would be: it isn't present at all or you can't obtain it for some reason (not allowed to mine radioactives and rare earth elements tend to come mixed with radioactive elements). Even the longest chain hydrocarbon can be created from carbon dioxide, water and some other commonly found elements. It is just that it takes a lot of energy to put the long chain molecules together and isn't worth it if you can get it from another source (and the transportation energy is less than the creation energy). 

First problem: Disease If the magic doesn't stop them from rotting then you have a whole flock of walking Typhoid Marys. Once the immune system shuts down then all the diseases that like to live in humans just go to town. If the magic that animates the zombie stops the rot then that solves that problem and they shouldn't smell too bad. Second problem: Control 

Hunting and killing is natural. The animals do it. Offering thanks for the animal that gave up its life are common in many native cultures on Earth. Also, pre-hunting prayers that an animal that is willing to die will present itself. Similarly, cutting and use of trees shouldn't be forbidden. However, they should favor trees that are damaged or that are too close together for good growth, etc. Otherwise, is this is a PETA culture where the trees and animals are more important than the people. They should just sit down and wait to starve to death. 

As mentioned, the obvious way is to get them to pass a bill. The sneaky way is to outsource so many of the countries activities that, eventually, Parliament becomes a bunch of figureheads with, maybe, slightly more clout than the royal family. Or less clout if the royal family owns/influences those businesses. 

Energy - solar converted to microwaves and beamed back to earth. Water split into hydrogen and oxygen for refueling vehicles in space. It is easier and safer to ship water and convert it at a central waypoint for refueling vehicles. Finished Goods - it can use microgravity to produce goods that are worth more than the raw materials. Otherwise, I'd just drop the raw goods onto the planet. People - people are expensive to lift off the planet. If you can make some in orbit, you save a lot of money. 

I don't think it'll work without active control. Even then, your plan would borrow energy from the rotation which would be bad in the long run. As has been pointed out, rivers require weather. You have to evaporate water from the low lying pools and release it as rain on higher ground. Theoretically you could taper the inside of the cylinder near the ends (making the ends of the cylinder "high ground"). Then, with differential heating, make the center of the cylinder warmer and try to start a air circulation patter running from the center to each end along the ground (with return through the axis). This would cause the air to release the moisture that it picked up at the center. This will form a cycle that will allow the flowing of rivers. The problem that I see with that is that it relies on the rising air releasing its water. In the rotating cylinder, the gravity decreases dramatically as you approach the center. The lower gravity would allow the air to hold larger droplets of water before they are heavy enough to fall. Would this be enough to prevent weather in the cylinder? I don't know. If that is the case, this might still work if you have water condensers on the ends (or, maybe, on a spine running through the axis) and get your water out of the air that way. 

You could go with a floating city but that's a lot of wood in contact with the water. You can minimize the wood contact with the water by building the city on pitch soaked pylons (maybe even copper clad). Each building would be build independently with hanging walkways between them and hinged ramps or rope ladders to floating docks under the buildings. The trouble is that wood rots very well in a swamp. So the pylons would have to be easily replaceable. Replacement would have to happen less often the better protected the pylons are (hence the pitch, creosote, or cladding). Possibly have wealthy or powerful people use imported stone for their pylons. The size of the city will be limited because they will eventually deforest the swamp if it is too large. That's why imported stone would be the best solution for a long term city. Maybe only the outer/newer buildings will have wood pylons. Or maybe a slum with rotting pylons that they scavenged from building replacing old pylons. I picture the first step of wealth being building half stone half wood pylons (just enough stone to hold the wood out of the water most of the time). Then, eventually, have all stone. The half pylons would bean that you can replace two rotting pylons for the price of one (cut the pylon in half to place on the stone). This would be an investment in the long term cost savings for the family. Building the stone up to a full pylon is one pylon that would "never" (for at least a few generations) have to be replaced. That will protect the family from future hard times. This would also allow people to see how wealthy a family is, just by looking at the pylons. Another problem with a large settlement in the swamp will be food. If there is some crop that can float on the water, grow in the water, or grow in shallow water, that would be good. Otherwise, they'll run out of fish in the local area. Also, think of why they are there. What can they get there that they can't get somewhere else that has easier living conditions?
