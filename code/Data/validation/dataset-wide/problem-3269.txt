My father was torpedoed off the US east coast by U-653 in May 1942. U-boats were more easily able to cause economic sabotage by sinking ships in US coastal waters than by attacking US ports. U-boats are not equipped to duel with shore batteries. U-boats are very vulnerable because the slightest crack to their pressure hulls will prevent them diving. Their so called ballast tanks were mainly used to house fuel and even slight damage could cause them to trail oil behind them for hundreds of miles enabling patrol aircraft to follow such a trail and destroy them. In September 1917 Scarborough was bombarded by a German U-boat and in Australia, Japanese submarines made bombardments of Newcastle and Sydney during 1942 but these were only pin prick attacks of no strategic significance. Such attacks were more dangerous to the submarines than they were to their intended targets. 

Did the Germans know about the Operation Torch landings in late 1942 and if so what steps were taken in particular by the Luftwaffe to intervene? 

For the Hiroshima bomb (Little Boy) with 64kg of Uranium only 700 grams was fissioned, or about 1.09% before the remaining HEU was blown apart. Interestingly a soil sample survey from Hiroshima in 1983 could no longer detect evidence of Uranium above background levels. The superiority of using Plutonium came from the fact reactors at Haniford could produce it from un-enriched Uranium. It also made the weapon fail safe. 

I was looking up the income disparity today. What I got for America, was Food service could get as little as $18,000 annual income, while Lawyers got paid $140,000, surgeons $320,000, and Bill Gates made something between 2,600,000,000 and $11,500,000,000 annually. So Bill Gates earns over 600,000 times the income of the poorest job I could find. My question was how much of an income gap there was in medieval Europe, to compare? Were the Kings and merchant guild leaders earning 600,000 times what the day labourer was earning, in the middle ages? If you need the time narrowed down further, I was thinking from the years 1200 to 1400. 

Most people are familiar with the Stielhandgranate that appeared in 1915, and saw use in both world wars. The question I have, is whether it was the first of its kind, a stick-grenade? Were there no stick-grenade designs before it? This would be very surprising if it was the first of its kind, as stick-grenades seem like a simple technology (that is, an explosive attached to a long handle, for the purpose of throwing it farther). In particular, I could see it having great use to the grenadiers in the 17th century. Was it perhaps, because grenades in the earlier days of powder warfare were too heavy to make use of this design? 

In 1963 the body of a German navy NCO was found in Neelova Gulf with the remnants of his uniform and rifle ammunition. In 1985 Soviet helicopter pilot Peter Statsyukom discovered a small complex of five underground Nazi bunkers in the delta of the Lena River in the Siberian Arctic. Lena Delta Lena Delta cliffs Apparently these artificial caves were built into a large rocky outcrop and blasted out with explosives. Nearby there was a 200m concrete jetty built linked by a small tramway to the storage caves. These storage bunkers sheltered 250 German manufactured fuel drums. Inside an accommodation bunker they also found Nazi era coins, German naval badges and buttons. There had always been wartime tales amongst the indigenous Yakut people about mysterious men called chuchuna dressed in black spotted in the Bykovskaya Duct area between 1940-42. According to some accounts when the intact wreck of a German U-boat, U-534 was raised in the Baltic by a wealthy private individual, amongst her soaked papers were orders at the end of WWII to sail to the Lena Delta. My question is what was the base used for? Was it in support of U-boat operations to Japan or to refuel flying boat operations to Japan, or for espionage/reconnaissance flights deep into the soviet rear? Does anybody know and if so please could you identify sources? 

Reportedly (from a source I cannot recall) the British had a very "interesting" guide about the Balkans. It had a sort of cheat sheet to the peoples around that area, with the stereotypical appearance, political views, and relations to other peoples in the Balkans. I saw an excerpt of this, but never managed for find a copy of this strange manual. Does anyone know any more details about it? 

That implies something like 1 in 6 to 1 in 4 troops were casualties, if we assume the vast majority of casualties were from combat. Thinking of Justcal's statistics from before, it was about 58,000 casualties, 48,000 from battle. So, if we assume non-combat casualties were involved with the first statistic (questionable assumption) then about 1 in 12 are combat casualties. Then 1 in 7.2 to 1 in 5.2, for combat troops, using those estimates. Calculating the Daily Odds Now, if we assume this is at all accurate, we only need to do a little math to get the daily chance of being wounded or killed. I'll only go through the higher estimate, 1 in 5.2, for now, . The Vietnam war lasted about 20 years for the USA, and our numbers are on a per year basis. However, this doesn't matter, so long as we assume our soldiers only served one tour of duty for simplification. In a tour, the infantryman saw about , so Conclusion So, the odds on a daily basis are pretty low: 0.08%. And that's with the high estimate. Having less than a 0.1% chance of being a casualty sounds pretty good. But over 240 days... it stacks up to a 19% chance, which is not comfortable odds for risking life and limb. 

Tests were performed with such ramjet engines atop a Dornier 217 aircraft in France through the war. 

The western (Pacific) seaboard of North America and even Peru have many examples of Caucasian settlement predating the vikings and Colombus. caucasian discoveries map Welsh speaking indians Along the Missouri river a tribe of Welsh speaking Mandan Indians later wiped out by Smallpox raised eyebrows. In Peru the Chachapoya people have pale Celtic features with red hair and freckles. The Chachapoya culture—characterized by its stately stone buildings—developed approximately between 100 and 400 AD, according to scientific dating methods, long before the Inca made similar achievements. In Washington state a 9,000 year old skeleton known as Kenewick man was found to have Caucasian features in contrast to the American Indian tribes of that area. The local tribes became so incensed and felt so threatened they declared the skeleton to be ancestral and forbade any further scientific investigation of Kenewick Man 

Hitler at the time was demanding a corridor of territory linking Pomerania with the Germanic peoples of East Prussia known as the Danzig corridor. During 1938 Britain and France had acquiesced and actually agreed with Hitler's Carlsbad program demanding that the Czechs should surrender territory which had majority German populations. Anglo French support for these demands undoubtedly persuaded Hitler that Britain and France would come to agree with his point of view over the Danzig corridor. The other side of the coin is that during 1939 Poland was threatening to seize Silesia from Germany for Germany suspending war reparations payments in 1935. Poland was banging the drum and demanding that Britain and France support her in making such a seizure so there was heightened tension before the German invasion. Poland was trying to invoke the treaty of Brest-Litvosk to induce Britain and France to join Poland in its invasion of Silesia. It may be that Hitler interpreted Anglo French unwillingness to participate in the proposed Polish annexation of Silesia as an unwillingness to defend Poland. The short answer therefore is that I do not think Hitler anticipated the British response. 

In the Colonial Period, Europe had some ideas about the enlightenment that made slaves unpleasant to their sympathies. For that reason, despite the English having slaves in their colonies, you could become a free man by visiting Britain's shores (there were some interesting court cases related to this). More important to this era was poverty, which was a big issue in European cities. So there was no shortage of cheap labour; even with the dying out of serfdom. Serfdom lost popularity in Western Europe around the 1300s (though cases remained until the 1500s). The practice was continued in Eastern Europe for a lot longer, to try and fill the gap in the agricultural market that arose with the reduction of serfs. After the Napoleonic wars, serfdom mostly came to an end in Europe, save Russia. The place where a demand for cheap and harsh labour was in force, was in the colonies with their plantations. Recruiting people from the European homeland to farm this would've been difficult to convince them and expensive to pay them, so slaves were the economical way out. 

Someone has told me that all nobility, when they hunted animals, it is in armour. They are further convinced that depictions of normally clothes hunters, are either not nobles, or they are wearing armour under their tight clothes. Thus, I would like to ask the truth of the matter. Do you know of cases of high-ranking nobility hunting dangerous animals, in armour and without armour? Written cases are preferred, as art can be interpreted very liberally. I'll mention that I'm aware hunting with and without armour has occurred, there's nothing stopping you from practicing either method. Some cultures seem to have preferred hunting in armour.
