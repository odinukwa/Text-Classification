Bullets probably won't hurt him but larger calibers will probably still do. Although I think he would have problems moving around with a heavy shell like that. Also shells don't protect against shock so internal damage will happen even if the shell if undamaged. 

Radiation shielding would be a slight plus but I don't know if the liquid would help with high acceleration more than air, pretty sure it can help a bit with deceleration but the actual acceleration would still have the same force on your body. The structural integrity is not likely going to improve as the pressure of keeping the liquid inside the ship while accelerating would probably be much greater than keeping gas inside the ship. My solution to not wanting air on a ship would be to keep humans inside specific rooms in cryosleep on ships. There should be very little a human need to do while being a ship like this and the travel time around the solar system with near future technology will still take years. 

You can't have the situation you describe with the reasons you describe because the distance to the sun is in from earth is 150 million kilometers and going up 10km is not even noticeable at that scale. This same kind of math apply to your situation. Going 0.0000001% closer to the sun isn't going to suddenly turn normal Earth temperatures to burning and melting. This is 6 order of magnitudes of difference and scaling down does not really solve the problem. For 10km to make a difference, your planet would need to be extremely close to the star and the star would need to be extremely small. Even the smallest star would not make this possible. Generally, because of the atmosphere, a planet is also warmest lower down and gets cooler as you move up. On Earth, at 10km up, its freezing cold. 

I think it depends of the initial defense of the wizards. If they posses the Chinese wall which is secured from the beginning, or know they will be attacked, they will probably win. If not and the caveman will lunch an surprise attack, 3,000 people is to few to survive. If the caveman raided the village at night when everybody sleeps, there would be almost no resistance. Most would be killed in sleep or while waking up. The next big part of people die while in panic. The rest dies fighting or fleeing unarmed before they get any weapons. Only a few would be able to arm themselves and effective fight back. To few. In the last scenario I assume the wizards have an open town design and almost no military facilities. Also normal people don't posses firearms. That what I would assume from an peaceful society. Additional from those 3000 people not all are able to defend themselves. They could be to young or to old. And if they have the correct age, they still cold be in a fitness state where they would be no match for an enemy. The caveman on the other side have 100 people per wizard in addition they will most likely die younger and all young and adult men and woman would be stronger and tougher. So for every wizard that can defend there town would be 120 or more attackers. I could image 20 to 50 people to fend of the initial attack, get some firearms and regroup. Even if they use there superior firepower to kill enough caveman so they will retreat, the wizards would be as good as dead. Most likely all children and older people are dead, without some luck all women also. That would be the end. The survivors would soon run out of essential stuff like weapons, food, fuel, medicine or something else. Higher advanced civilizations have an higher specialization of individual. It is not likely that the survivors will have the knowledge in all fields they need to keep on fighting the caveman. Eventually they will get hunt down by the caveman. 

Make reproduction state controlled and then make it so children never experience puberty through hormone therapy or direct gen editing. No more sex means no more prostitution. People can be artificially grown in artificial wombs and the DNA is doctored so that there is good genetic diversity and no need for sexual reproduction. 

Their powers can have a minimal range. Or maybe they just don't like flying. Or they can't control their powers well enough to not hurt themselves if they were flying. 

If you were taking over Santa's role and had access to all his infrastructure and production, the cost will likely be 0. Santa has been in business for hundreds of years. Either he had a very large sum of money at the start and loses a fraction each year (which highly unlikely). Or he is self sufficient in what he does and his budget is completely balanced each year. Santa likely balances his Christmas budget perfectly every year and if he is personally bankrupt and requires a new Santa, the toy making business can be assumed to be completely self sufficient in terms of capital and the new Santa would not need any investments. Santa's actual job isn't to pay the bills, his job is to compile a list of all children and to check if they are naughty or nice. Twice. As well as deliver the presents on Christmas to all the children in the world. The actual accounting will likely be done by accounting elves. 

How reliably would it work? I would assume that the network would be very reliably (on the higher layer). The question would not be if the message arrives, but when. However interference could delay a message for hours (or days?). What would the expected bandwidths be? I think we can build a network that has enough bandwidth, but I didn't found information on this. So the rest of my answer assumes we have enough bandwidth. Would using it be exorbitantly expensive? I think the network would be quite expensive. However not necessary for the end user. A system wide internet could be subsidized by government and content provider which want to sell there content to the users. That's what happens today in not so dense populated regions to get fast internet there. And how would it actually feel to use such a system? If the user access planetary (his current location) resources there won't be a difference from today. As soon as he actually uses the interplanetary network, however somethings most likely will change drastic. Entertainment Any online game that has real-time interaction won't work. You could still have something like racing against ghosts of other players, simple leaderboards or playing something like chess. Like in the time when you played chess via mail (not E-Mail). Instant Video wouldn't be so instant as long as it is not cached anywhere. Big players could maybe hold a copy of all there content in different datacenters around the system. However if you want to use a service that don't provide this, the question would not be "what should we watch (now)", but "what should we watch tomorrow". So you will request the content and watch it when it comes. If you have an abo for series they will start sending you a copy to watch offline as soon as it is released (maybe still DRM protected). Information News will be as today. You will still be notified but it will take longer. This could result in a trend back to traditional media. If you need to wait several hours for your information maybe you can wait an hour longer for verified information. Surfing the internet from link to link will not work. There could be an indicator how long it would take to load a Link. Is it a local resource or it is already cached. Often accessed sides will (as already today) be cached. But good caching will get much more important. Surfing will often result in I want to read this and that later. On the technical site requesting a Website would not only deliver the site but also other sites of the domain and other linked content directly. Communication We would not use messengers as much. There wont be any direct communication. We will go back to E-Mail, or something similar. Maybe we would write more and longer letters, like in the time where there was no telephone. Communication on websites should change to (in order to be still somehow use full). Forums will need to structure the communication better. You need to know which post related to which other in order to follow the discussion. Some websites will only used locally because the discussions are to fast to allow anyone from far away to participate. Other Sites could use some mechanism to counter this by showing posts only after a specific time they where posted (when the user pressed send, not the server received the post). 

A huge part of the army doesn't actually do any combat, only exist to supply the line and manage operations, this can easily be done by non-super people. 

You will get less "nutrients" from what ever you propose than simply butchering the person and then eating all of the meat, organs and blood. At the end of the day, the person is only going to have so many calories in their body and human bodies do not produce calories from nothing. The end result is that you need to feed the human food to keep him alive. Not sure why you'd do this with a human, you can just eat human food and get more nutrients than you'd feed the human to keep him alive and then drinking his blood. 

They are hermaphrodites that reproduce by direct contact with each other. In their reproduction cycle, if 2 organisms touch, they inject each other with genetic material and then both will die off in the process of creating offspring. 

This kind of breathing is likely less efficient than just having a central system like the nose and lungs. Arthropods have a problem growing very large in real life and this is one of the reason why they might be limited. Back when the Earth was more oxygenated and there was less competition from other animals was when large arthropods existed. 

I would assume a raising popularity of IaaS provider that will replicate your content over the howl system. Even small blogs that currently are hosted in private environments maybe want to migrate to bigger providers. We would maybe also see more toplevel domains that indicate the location, like .us.earth or .mars, .pluto and .sun. The underling protocols of the internet must change drastic as the application the end user uses must change in order to give him enough information what will happens if he clicks this link. Nobody wants to click a link in twitter and sitting there for hours until the site loads. I think log distance communication will feel more like in old days before telephone. There wont be any non local news with live broadcast from the place where something happens. Nobody can ask questions to the journalists at the place. Most likely the information will still be published as soon as it is available. But the livetcker would not be live anymore. 

What would a typical user use such a network for? Well we talking about interplanetary internet so the user will (want) to use it for what we use it today. 

The star's energy output perfectly equals it's gravitational binding energy because the energy output is what keeps the star from collapsing under it's own gravity, it is why stars eventually stop being stars when they no longer have a exothermic nuclear fusion reaction to fuel them. This is the equilibrium of energy output and size of the star. The star existing in this equilibrium means that altering the size in any way requires more energy than you can gain from the star due to the laws of thermodynamics. Although the star exists in equilibrium, it does not mean that it doesn't have different energy levels that don't exist in nature. Stars theoretically can have locally stable energy states that are not the natural one that all stars share. Maybe if you were to add enough energy to the star to reach temperatures on Planck scale, you would reach different physics than we currently know and gain energy afterward. This wouldn't really make much sense because Planck temperature is 1.417×10^32 and even siphoning millions of stars will not give you enough energy to get to that point. 

With a black hole that small and that close, you'd easily be able to see it as an gamma ray source. According to your sheet, the thing is outputting 20 Pentawatts of hawking radiation. Which is more 4000x more power than the total power the earth gets from from the sun.
