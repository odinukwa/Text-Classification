i am working out in gym from last 3 months.... [ 4 days week , 30 minutes per day ] I want muscle , shape & want to be fit.... I did't saw any major improvements as i did't workout out intensively & did't took enough protein. [ maximum i was taking 50 g protein from food per day [ no other protein supplements ] , but i need atleast 120 g protein per day for my body weight.] also due to some reason i cant able to take more than 50 gm protein per day for next one month. after one month i can take up to more than 120 g protein per day. So is it better to go and workout in gym for next one month or is it better to skip gym for next one month , is there any advantage in going to gym for next month ? 

I am skinny fat , physically bit weak boy [ 26 age ] with 6.1 tall [ 1.83 ] and reduced my body weight from 78 kg [ 171 pounds] to 71 kgs [156 pounds] . still i have some belly and i wanted to eliminate that completely. along with that i want to get some shape and muscle. right now i am doing cardio 60 - 90 minutes per week and i am in calorie deficit diet. what i want to know is "I want to do strength training also" along with cardio. So how much cardio and how much strength training is not too much for me ? may i go with 5 days [ 30 minutes/day ] strength training & 3 days [ 30 minutes/day ] cardio per week ? 

Are you forefoot striking? Forefoot striking places more load on your calves than a heel strike would, and could explain the soreness in your calves. And forefoot striking is a good thing as it tends to prevent more serious injuries. In addition to this, one might think that eventually your calf muscles would catch up. But this depends on the distance you're running and of course nutrition. It'd be easier to build muscle in the areas that are lagging behind with shorter/faster running sessions. This is apparent when you look at long distance runners vs sprinters. The sport shapes the athlete, so to speak. I remember when I first started sprinting a few times a week. I was amazed at how every single muscle in my legs were sore the day after. And all I did was sprint about 100 meters three times with a little rest in between. Running hills as Sarge suggested would be another high intensity workout which would be great for the thighs. 

Diet is a huge part of this, of course. When I first started my weight training routine and 6 meal-per-day diet in 2005 I was 6'5" and 140 pounds @ 7% bodyfat. Yeah, pretty skinny. I was a real gym rat for years before this but had very limited success. I simply hadn't figured out my diet, and I was working out way too much and not allowing sufficient recovery time. So anyway in 2005 I began my new approach. Now, I have a ridiculously fast metabolism. This I know. But I hadn't really counted calories to determine what it would actually take to gain weight. Well I found that I needed around 3,500 to 4,000 calories a day to gain weight while working out 3 days a week. So as it turned out, a big part of my training was simply building my appetite to handle that much food. I was consistent and managed to put on 20 pounds of muscle and 10 pounds of fat in the first 10 months. I gained a bit more fat than I would've liked since I ate a little too much fast food, but nevertheless those results were by far the best I ever had. 

do i need to follow above ? I am a beginner & also is above statement depends on Intensity level ? currently i am working in LOW intensity ? 

which is better option in below to reduce body fat 1)morning - 80 % protein , afternoon - 80 % carbohydrates , evening - handfull of nuts & eating only fruits at dinner. 2)taking carbs, proteins , fats & fruits for breakfast, lunch, dinner ? 

Mr.A & Mr.B, Mr.C all three workout in same level & eat same amount of protein & Carbs.... Mr.A sleeps for 9 hours.... Mr.B sleeps for 8 hours.... Mr.C sleeps for 7 hours.... Is Mr. A build the muscle early [ or more ] than Mr.C ? How much sleep really matters for muscle gain?.... In our Gym , some seniors tell they sleep only 6 hours due to lack of time, still they have good muscles!.... 

Is it okay to workout in gym , when i am suffering from diarrhea ? or is it better to take rest that day ? Please give me some suggestions on this.... 

From last 6 months , Due to very good diet & little bit cardio, i reduced my weight & fat [belly] , now i started to workout in Gym from few days for strength training & started to eat both carbs and proteins more than before.... seems like instead of muscles, again i am getting belly fat , how to get muscles without getting any little but fat ? What wrong i am doing here ? 

You can't really spot reduce. In other words, you don't have any control of where you'll lose fat. Chances are you have lost some fat all over, even if you haven't noticed visible changes. In fact, it's not a bad idea to make weekly measurements for this exact reason. You can actually measure your bodyfat pretty easily with a simple set of bodyfat calipers (instructions come with the calipers) along with a bathroom scale. Not only is it encouraging to know you're making progress, but you can even adjust your diet and exercise regimen accordingly if you determine that you're losing muscle, for example. If you're interested in changing your body composition, building muscle, and losing fat then I'd look into high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as demonstrated here. Some exercises done with HIIT may be more anaerobic than others and you can pick and choose your routine based on your goals. But whatever you do, be smart and track your progress with bodyfat measurements. It literally takes 2 minutes and you only have to do it once a week. 

The RunAmocs from Soft Star Shoes are nice. I have a pair which I've reviewed here. Actually my review talks more about the transition to minimalist shoe running than the shoes themselves, but you can get the idea. They are very lightweight shoes with a Vibram 2mm rubber sole. When I first put them on they didn't seem to fit very snug like I'm used to. But because they are so extremely light and flexible, they actually stay on the feet very well. My reasons for getting these instead of the Vibram Five Fingers are twofold: 

I have a pair of dumbbells and access to a few machines. I can do the following exercises with proper form and I can't have a trainer to learn newer exercises now. Lower body: Lunges, Bulgarian split squat, step up, hamstring curls Abs and back: Back extension, plank, side plank Upper body: bench press / push up, chest flies, shoulder press, shoulder front and lateral raise, rear delt flies, rows (not sure about form though), lat pull I'm not able to figure out which pair of exercises balance each other and if all muscle groups get hit with the above exercises. 

I have been doing plank hold in good form since atleast 2-3 months. I get shakey after 10 seconds even though I can hold it between 60-75 seconds. I don't see any improvement in shakiness. What does it mean? Is it Weak core? 

From last 6 months, I started with a knee issue and I find gradually more and more joints like hips, shoulder, ankle becoming noisy (as in popping/ snapping /noises like rubbing of cartilage) and sometimes accompanied by pain and it is becoming scary. I don't have ortho/PT specializing in sports medicine in my place and the rest haven't been of much help. One PT however did tell I have muscle imbalance, which I realize I do because of thoroughly unbalanced training and neglect in stretching. But again he didn't mention which muscles and said I can do all kind of exercises I want, that I actually can't. I can't do exercises involves running, twisting and jumping and fast movements as in martial arts. I was wondering if starting a balanced barbell training under a trainer and stretching sufficiently a good idea. I mean is that what people with joint issues do when they can't get medical help due to whatever reason. It might look like paralysis by analysis but I started treatment with a PT with open mind and ended up worsening pain in my knees. This has made a skeptic out of me... I'm not sure if this kind (unspecific?) question is entertained is this forum. 

Eat 6 times a day, with protein in every meal. By eating smaller meals more frequently this will allow you to absorb more nutrients from your food. More than that, as you get used to it, this may even allow you to eat more calories throughout the day because each meal doesn't have to be so big. Aim for a 30% protein / 40% carbohydrate / 30% fat split with your diet. This is actually a lot of protein, but your body needs lots of protein when you're weight training. I'd suggest using this simple calorie calculator. Lift weights 3 days a week. It doesn't sound like much. And in fact modern bodybuilders will workout more often than this. But then again they also take steroids which reduces recovery time. Before the days of steroids, Steve Reeves was one of the more impressive bodybuilders around. He wrote a book called, "Building the Classic Physique," and in the book even he suggested a 3 day-a-week routine. In fact, the book is a good training guide even today. 

First thing's first -- you mentioned that you haven't gained any weight. As simple as it sounds, you need more calories. Once you're eating enough calories you will gain weight. As for whether it's fat or muscle depends on a lot of things. You asked about protein shakes. I'll just say that there's nothing wrong with drinking them. Their biggest advantage is the convenience. That, and whey protein is a high quality protein. Then again, so are eggs. But if you're having trouble getting enough protein with regular food then a protein drink/shake is a good convenient way to supplement your diet. A few more tips... 

Currently I am working on Chest & biceps [ Mon ] , Triceps [ Tue ] , Back [ Wed] , Shoulders [ Thu ], Legs [ Fri ] from Mon to friday.... Somewhere i read below : 

I started to workout in gym Age : 27, Male Height : 6.1 [184 ] Weight : 68 kgs [ 150 pound] [ Lightly active (moderate exercise but sedentary job)] usually i eat 50gms/110 pounds of protein per day , According to this link , if i want muscle gain, i need 179 Gm/393 pound protein , OMG is that much protein really required ? 

I workout on Monday - thursday & dont take required amount of protein to build muscles due to some reasons.... i can able to take enough protein from friday to sunday.... so if i need 150g protein per day to gain muscle, if i take **50 g protein per day from monday to thursday & if i take 150 g protein per day from friday to sunday , will that helpfull to build muscles ? 

i am skinny fat & badly wanted to reduce belly fat. I am not such powerfull boy at the age of 26. maximum i can run half an hour in morning , so may i run half an hour in evening also , is that fine ? or is it better to take some rest in morning and run for half an hour again. 

As asked in the comments, "how do I know that I've overtrained"? There are some indicators of this, such as a rise in your resting heart rate. But perhaps the most reliable thing would be to pay close attention to how you feel on the day of any given workout. If, for example, you still feel sore and fatigued from the previous workout, and you decide to workout anyway then make a note of your work capacity for the day. If you're not able to lift as much weight, or simply run out of steam faster then there's a good chance that's due to overtraining. 

It sounds like you've reached the tipping point, and are possibly overtraining at times. Long training sessions will cause a rise in cortisol levels, putting your body into a catabolic state. This will make you feel tired and can even stunt muscle growth. Cortisol levels rise when the body is put under stress. Of course inconsistency plays a big part as well. Any inconsistency in your training will wreak havoc on your energy levels. A few suggestions: 

You can extend your range of motion, which in turn puts even more focus on the chest. You avoid unnecessary strain on the wrists. 

After having pushed myself too hard on incorrect form and nursing multiple injuries, I want to start lifting afresh under a coach. My goal is to gain strength without gain in size, though I wouldn't mind if it comes as a natural consequence. This time, I want to be very, very particular about form. In my place, trainers at commercial gym are body-building oriented and not that particular about details of correct form. I am planning to train under a powerlifting coach. However, I have a few concerns. I have come across ideas like powerlifters aren't very concerned about form, their main focus is to lift as heavy as they can. This idea probably came from a few figure-competitors and body-builders. Just want to know if there is any truth in the above statement? 

I am stuck with a knee injury since August 2013, with not much a progress then. PT's haven't been of much help. Ortho diagnosed I have chrondomalacia pattelae. I also think i have some pelvic misalignment and strength imbalances in posterior and anterior chain muscles. I have come across two PT's now who are pretty experienced - they treat competitive athletes on a regular basis. Both of them have asked me to jog for a few days even if it hurts and that body has its own way of healing. In my knowledge, one shouldn't exercise on the top of pain, especially when its a joint pain. And again high impact exercises when one already has leg length difference (due to pelvic misalignment?). To me, it doesn't make sense at all. Looking at their experience, I am wondering am I missing something. Are there injuries there where one has to do exercises that cause pain in the site of injury and then they really heal? I'm afraid my question is a bit vague. 

I agree with BenWillkommen's suggestions. I have two more which don't require a gym with a squat rack... 

Indeed the quantities to promote continuous muscle growth can be quite large. I was consistently eating around 4,000 calories a day for about a year when I was weight training and trying to gain mass. But then, I'm 6'5" and have an extremely fast metabolism so my body demanded those calories. It worked though, as I was able to gain 20 pounds of muscle that year. The best way to figure it out for yourself is to measure and track your progress and make adjustments accordingly. You can do this with a simple set of body fat calipers and a bathroom scale. If you can get in the habit of measuring your weight and body fat weekly, then you can extract from that gains or losses in LBM (lean body mass). Say for example you manage to lose 1 pound each week, for 3 weeks in a row and half of that is fat / half is LBM. Well, if your goal is to gain muscle you should absolutely eat more calories in this case. Ideally you should be making small gains in LBM every week while minimizing fat gain. And it's just a matter of finding the diet that'll do that for you. By the way, the reason it's better to measure weekly is that you can drive yourself crazy measuring daily due to small fluctuations and inaccuracies. In fact, as a rule of thumb it's usually wise to gather 3 weeks of measurements before making any major changes to your diet.
