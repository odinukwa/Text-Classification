The feature in the photograph ressembles a condensation trail. Meteors usually move rather rapidly, mostly perish within a few seconds or less. In rare cases they may leave long trails; the meteor would have been very bright (brighter than the moon) in those cases, moving much faster than an aeroplane. 

Not that easy way. Only stars heavy enough will undergo a supernova explosion. The majority of stars is too light. The lifetime of a star is mostly determined by its mass. In some cases (supernova type Ia) a companion star provides mass to white dwarf, which originally has been too light to explode as a supernova. Hence your technique can only work, if it is applied to stars of a certain mass and composition separately, and then summed or integrated up over all these restricted classes of stars. All together you'll get results for stars which eventually will end up as supernova, i.e. the heavy ones with more than about 8 solar masses. ... And in the meanwhile new stars will form. 

(More on non-Euclidean geometry.) If the observable universe is positively curved, it could be a fragment of the surface of a 3-sphere resp. 3+1-de Sitter space-time. A 3-sphere is finite. If the observable universe is flat (curvature 0), it could be a fragment of an infinite Euclidean space resp. 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time. That's plausible, but not the only possible extrapolation beyond the observable universe. An almost flat observable universe could e.g. be a fragment of a huge 3-spherical universe or of a huge 3-torus. Planck data don't indicate (in a significant way) that kind of structure outside the observable universe, but extrapolations become less valid the further we go beyond the observable universe. According to the current (Lambda-CDM) model of the universe together with the best-fit parameters, the universe is flat within the limits of measurement. Hence it's plausible (by extrapolation), but not necessary, that the universe is either huge or even infinite. 

Without checking the numbers in detail, according to Wikipedia, the volume of the observable universe is about $3.5\cdot 10^{80} \mbox{ m}^3$, and the volume of Earth is about $1.08321\cdot 10^{21} \mbox{ m}^3$. By dividing the two volumes we get a factor of $3.2\cdot 10^{59}$, or written as decimal number: The observable comoving volume of the universe is about 320,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000-times the volume of Earth. 

Assumed a Venus year is 0.615 198 Earth years. 0.615 198 yr / (1 - 0.615 198) = 1.598739 yr = 583 days 11 hours 24 minutes for one period in mean, or roughly 19.5 months. That's 1.598739 periods for Earth and 2.598739 periods for Venus: 1.598739 * 365.256 days = 583.95 days = 2.598739 * 224.705 days The relative accuracy should be somewhere near 1e-5. Since both orbits are elliptical the actual period oscillates around that mean value. 

The "raw" LORRI image is 1024x1024 pixels. The field of view is about 0.29°, see section 3.6 of this paper, or abstract of this paper. Pluto is a little less than 250 pixels in the raw image, corresponding to 0.29° x 250/1024 = 4'15'', well consistent with your estimate. 

With $H_0=67.8\mbox{ }(\mbox{km}/{\mbox{s}})/\mbox{Mpc}$ the Hubble constant according to the Planck mission, $c=299,792,458\mbox{ m}/\mbox{s}$ the speed of light, and one Megaparsec $1\mbox{ Mpc}=3.0857\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ m}$, we get $$r_{\mbox{HS}}=\frac{c}{H_0}=\frac{299,792,458\mbox{ m}/\mbox{s}}{67.8\cdot 10^3\mbox{ }(\mbox{m}/{\mbox{s}})/3.0857\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ m}}=1.3644\cdot 10^{26}\mbox{ m}.$$ That's $$1.3644\cdot 10^{26}\mbox{ m}/1.3644\cdot 10^{26}\mbox{ m}= 4,421 \mbox{ Mpc}$$ or $r_{\mbox{HS}}=14.422$ billion lightyears (1 pc = 3.26156 ly). Hence objects further away than this proper distance (what you would measure with a chain of rulers) recede faster than the speed of light. The distance is also called Hubble length. You may find 13.8 billion lightyears elsewhere. That's calculated with $H_0=70.4\mbox{ }(\mbox{km}/{\mbox{s}})/\mbox{Mpc},$ according to the estimates of 2010, based on WMAP data, or with even older data. The exact value is not known. Since the Hubble constant isn't really constant over time, the universe is thought to be a little younger (13.8 billion years) than the 14.422 billion years you get by just dividing the Hubble distance by the speed of light. 

The question seems to be based on the notion "before". This notion relies of the concept of the arrow of time, meaning time "flowing" in some "direction". The arrow of time itself is based, among others, on the notion of "time". The Planck epoch - the first epoch of the current Big Bang model - lasted a little less than $10^{-43}\mbox{ s}$. That's the shortest unit of time. To ask within this short time interval for an arrow of time doesn't make any sense. Hence a before/after didn't exist within the Planck epoch, and hence asking for a "before" isn't meaningful within the Planck epoch. The Planck epoch to be able to exist needs the mere existence of space and time, not yet an arrow of time. The cause for the existence of space and time at all is a matter of the pre-Planck epoch. In this phase using any notion which is based on space or time isn't meaningful. Cause and effect in the temporal sense, which underly most "why?"-questions, are based on time, and are meaningless in this epoch. It's possible to construct other "pre-Big-Bang" models. But it's hard to find observational evidence for any of them. If you suggest a creator of whatever kind, you just push the ultimate question a little bit further to the "past", and making it much more complicated. How could a creator be created, able to create such a complex thing like the universe? You need a chain of ever more complex meta-creators without end. If you argue, that the first creator doesn't need a cause to exist, this applies also for the universe, formed from a pre-Planck medium. Hence nothing would be won. Therefore it's rather unlikely, that religion or philosophy could be able to provide a more satisfying answer than science. (Here some metaphysical multiverse theories.) 

The notions of today's universe don't make much sense for the (hypothetical) pre-Planck epoch of the universe. All four known fundamental forces should have been united. Matter didn't exist. It can form only in cooler conditions. Even cause and effect don't work well below Planck scales. The structure you eventually get can be treated in terms of a groupoid, as described e.g. in this paper. Groupoids are related to groups (algebra). Groups actually are - in some sense - very simple groupoids. You may construct some groupoids from disjoint groups by connecting them via isomorphisms. So you get kind of a network of abstract entities. Now try to adjust quantum mechanics and General Relativity, such that it fits with these structures, meaning without the smooth space and time, as usually assumed for standard physics. Let known or extrapolated physics of the Planck- and GUT (grand unified theory) epoch emerge from the pre-Planck physics to start the actual Big Bang. It's possible to construct physical theories for a pre-Planck era. But it's very hard to find observational or experimental evidence to test these theories with respect to actual physics. Those pre-Planck groupoid theories can be defined in a way that they don't need a predecessor epoch, e.g. by eliminating the macroscopic cause and effect paradigm, which is based on a notion of an arrow of time. Causality and a concept of before/after on isomorphic entities doesn't make much sense. Although, there should be some mechanism which eventually disrupted a strictly non-local pre-Planck configuration. 

The simple answer to your headline question is: No. That kind of correlation between different angles has been investigated, and no significant correlation beyond 1 degree (first acoustic peak), e.g. large-scale circular structures in the CMB, has been found. Details about the investigation of non-trivial topologies within the limits of recombination, see this Planck paper. Closer-by structures (like galaxy clusters) visible by telescopic observations are correlated to gravitational lensing of the CMB, as described in this Planck paper, or by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, as described in this Planck paper, since galaxy clusters tend to be correlated with dark matter halos. Repeating pattens (from mirroring) would be evident from 3d maps (like this one for the local 300 Mpc environment) of the mass distribution or telescopic observations. Multiple images of distant objects are well-known, e.g. as Einstein crosses, or Einstein rings, caused by gravitational lensing. This can include mirroring in extreme cases; it's well-known how this would look like. 

The dull red color has been due to atmospheric causes, like the reddish sun close to sunset. There hasn't been an astronomical reason for the reddish color. A few days after New Moon moonset occurs short after sunset, so you won't see the Moon high over the horizon at those evenings. With each day the Moon is a little higher above the horizon after sunset. It's hence less close to the horizon at the same time of the day. Less close to the horizon means less atomospheric absorption/scattering responsible for the dull red color, assuming the same weather conditions. At Full Moon the Moon is at the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth. Moon is then rising shortly after sunset. 

There exists probably about one supermassive black hole per galaxy, hence about 100 billion ($10^{11}$) in the observable universe. If we take 1% of the stars ending as a black hole as a very rough order of magnitude estimate, we'll get about 1 billion stellar black holes per galaxy, hence about $10^{20}$ stellar black holes in the observable universe, give or take one order of magnitude. Stars of more than about 15 stellar masses (O class stars) will probably end up as black holes. About 0.00003% of the stars are O-class. The lifespan of a star with 15 solar masses is about 11.5 million years. So, we need to multiply the 0.00003% at least by a factor 1000, since the age of the universe is more than 1000-times the life of an O-class star, resulting in 0.03% of all stars over time should have been O-class stars. (Most stars are red dwarfs, and have a longer life-span than the current age of the universe.) Star formation, especially of heavy stars, in the early universe has probably been higher than today. Therefore I'm estimating the number of stellar black holes as about 1% the number of all stars. Intermediate-mass black holes as presumed centers of globular clusters are harder to estimate, since there isn't much observational evidence. If the hypotheses turns out to be correct, and we take 1000 globular clusters per galaxy, we get about $10^{14}$ IMBHs. There is no observational evidence for the existence of small black holes (smaller than a few solar masses). 

The earth similarity index (ESI) is a weighted geometric mean of four similarities. The formula documented on $URL$ (as of march 23, 2014) should be adjusted a bit, since $n$ should be the weight sum instead of the number of planetary properties. With the weights provided on the site we get $$ESI =\left( \left(1-\left | \frac{r_E - r_P}{r_E + r_P} \right |\right)^{0.57}\cdot \left(1-\left | \frac{\rho_E - \rho_P}{\rho_E + \rho_P} \right |\right)^{1.07}\cdot\\ \left(1-\left | \frac{v_E - v_P}{v_E + v_P} \right |\right)^{0.70}\cdot \left(1-\left | \frac{288\mbox{K} - \vartheta_P}{288\mbox{K} + \vartheta_P} \right |\right)^{5.58}\right)^{\frac{1}{7.92}},$$ with $r_E=6,371 \mbox{ km}~~$ Earth's radius, $r_P$ the radius of the planet, $\rho_E=5.515\mbox{ g}/\mbox{cm}^3$ Earth's bulk density, $\rho_P$ the bulk density of the planet, $v_E=11.2 \mbox{ km}/\mbox{s}~~$ the escape velocity on the surface of Earth, $v_P$ the escape velocity on the surface of the planet, and $\vartheta_P$ the surface temperature of the planet; the weight sum is $0.57+1.07+0.70+5.58=7.92$. Mars as an example: With $r_P=0.53 r_E$, $\rho_P=0.71 \rho_E$, $v_P=0.45v_E$, $\vartheta_P=227\mbox{ K}$ we get $$ESI_s =\left( \left(1-\left | \frac{0.47}{1.53} \right |\right)^{0.57}\cdot \left(1-\left | \frac{0.29}{1.71} \right |\right)^{1.07}\cdot\\ \left(1-\left | \frac{0.55}{1.45} \right |\right)^{0.70}\cdot \left(1-\left | \frac{61\mbox{ K}}{515\mbox{ K}} \right |\right)^{5.58}\right)^{\frac{1}{7.92}}=\\ (0.811241627\cdot 0.819676889\cdot 0.716163454\cdot 0.494865663)^{\frac{1}{7.92}}= 0.833189885$$ as surface similarity. (Some of the data used from here.) Global similarity combines surface similarity with interior similarity. Global similarity of Mars with Earth is about 0.7. Surface gravity can be calculated from radius and bulk density of a planet. The radius of an expoplanet can be estimated by the transit method, relating the estimated diameter of the star to the brightness change of the star during planet transit. The mass of the planet can be estimated by the wobble of the radial velocity of the star (using Doppler shift). By mass estimate of the star and the orbital period of the planet the distance of the planet to the star can be estimated. An estimate of the absolute brightness of the star can then be used to estimate the surface temperture of the planet. There exist more methods. The accuracy of these estimates vary with the quality of the observations. ESI values between 0.8 and 1.0 are considered as Earth-like. Details of the planet's atmosphere, amount of surface water, and other details are not considered in the formula. So it's just a very rough prioritization. With future spectroscopic data further refinement could be possible.
