This is the "wealth effect". It has been shown empirically that as one's assessment of their wealth increase, the more they spend. An important point to be made is that this may be disconnected from actual wealth. If you are counting on a big inheritance that may lead you to spend a higher % of your wealth now in expectation of the future payoff. There's a good paper that empirically looks at the correlation between wealth and spending but it's important to understand that the factors that influence an individual to spend money are numerous and it's virtually impossible to completely remove the signal from the noise. 

The equilibrium between money supply (which is set by the fed) and money demand (which is set by economic factors) generates the interest rate for the economy at a given time. The fed thus has power to affect the interest rate by increase or decrease the real money supply in order to maintain an interest rate. Given that the fed has complete control over the interest rate under this model it is often assumed that LM is horizontal due to the fact that the fed can set whatever rate they choose regardless of economic factors. 

What situation is this supposed to capture? It seems like it might be more useful to define conditional preferences as $f \succeq_E f'$ if $f(s) \succeq f'(s)$ for all $s \in E$. This definition seems like it might be more ... useful? For one, it seems to resemble conditional expectation that way (or does it?). What idea is the definition as given in the paper supposed to capture (this might be a simple question)? Also, would it be more general to say, in the definition given in the paper, that $f(s) \sim f'(s)$ instead of $f(s) = f'(s)$? 

This is a partial answer (see section 5.1, p. 79 of Cochrane's book, "Asset Pricing"). Suppose you wanted to treat the size of the firm as a factor. Stocks of smaller firms typically have higher average returns. You could then form a "large" holding company comprised of smaller firms. The new, large company would then have returns like a smaller company but would in fact be large and "the managers could enjoy the difference." 

I think this paper might be useful to you. It's a job market paper by one of Heckman's students at UChicago, named Rodrigo Pinto. The paper is titled "Selection Bias in a Controlled Experiment: The Case of Moving to Opportunity." In the MTO experiment, the voucher assignment mechanism was random but only approximately half that received the voucher ended up actually moving. This creates a problem because the usual analysis (treatment-effect-on-the-treated or intent-to-treat) will only tell us the causal effect of receiving a voucher. However, we are interested in the causal effect of the new neighborhood, not of receiving the voucher. He shows how to decompose the typical treatment-on-the-treated parameter into components that have unambiguous interpretations. Namely, he isolates the causal effect of the new neighborhood. 

You cant. It may be possible to predict the unemployment level based on some type of regression analysis on the wage rate but there is no way to determine one from the other. 

The financial bill you're describing exists. It's called the Dodd-Frank act and was enacted after the 08' crisis to further regulate securities which includes derivatives. $URL$ Before the Dodd Frank Act which passed in 2010 the main source of legislation for regulating the financial industry was The Securities Exchange act of 1934 which codified the government regulation on most financial instruments and is still the primary source of financial regulation today. $URL$ 

This is actually an interesting question that I've never really thought of. What you are essentially describing is a monopoly on the side of the consumers to artificially drive down quantity demanded in order to lower prices. You didn't state many details in your question but I'm assuming that the good in question is inelastic, is subject to competitive pricing, and has it's current price in competitive equilibrium. The outcome of consumers collectively refusing to buy a product above a certain price would have the same effect of monopolistic pricing of a firm but in reverse, there would be a shift of some producer surplus into consumer surplus as well as the creation of dead weight loss as some producers are priced out of the market creating shortages. This could also be empirically the same as the creation of a price ceiling for the good. If collectively consumers refused to buy a product above a certain price then that product would have a price ceiling and producers would produce at that price in accordance with their own supply curve. As for your question about whether it would be a "good idea" that depends on what your definition of a positive outcome is. This type of action would have the effect of transferring some of the producer surplus to the consumers which would benefit the consumers but it would simultaneously lead to less production on the part of the producers due to the lower price creating dead weight loss and shortages. Empirically this would be bad for the aggregate economy as a whole due to the loss of surplus to dead weight loss, however, depending on the producer supply curve this may or may not lead to an aggregate gain in consumer surplus. An inelastic supply curve would lead to a gain in aggregate consumer surplus while a elastic supply curve would lead to a loss. 

The robust standard errors on , for example, that I get in both Stata and R (using vcovHC) is 0.108. The book gives 0.083. For reference, the output of is 

Edesess is attacking what is really just a straw man of economics. I'm not sure he really understands the field. To start, economics is not math. We're not claiming that it is. It's more of an "applied" science. Economists have never claimed that these definitions are precise in the way that mathematics is. These definitions are modeling constructs---they're for applied work. They're use is temporary in a way. The point is to try to convey an idea in a more precise way than just in words---but everyone knows that they're not a precise as we would like and not as precise as they ultimately should be. They're meant to be debated and later refined. But, as all applied scientists know, you've got to start somewhere and sometimes ideas are best conveyed through simpler---if less detailed mean. Coming up with better definitions is a huge part of the economic science. Consider these examples. When the Cowles Foundation was founded in 1932 its motto was "Theory and Measurement" (the motto was first adopted in 1952). Measurement is not an easy thing to do. As another example, a lot of Larry Kotlikoff's work has dealt with how a lot of fiscal measures are not economically well-defined concepts. 

Yes, this is consumption. There are 3 ways to calculate GDP, income effect, value added effect, and value of final products. The simplest to understand is probably the income effect where the value of all wages and profits at every stage of production are added together to find final GDP. Since the household has paid rent and paid the bank for a service both payments count towards the income of both the landlord and the bank. If the household in your example borrowed to spend on rent at 2% interest and then paid back that next year it would be a net gain for GDP with going to the landlord's income and going to the bank's income for their service of lending out money. If the household defaulted on its debt then the bank would report a loss of on their income which would cancel out the gain on the part of the landlord. 

End of the 14th year is essentially the same as the start of the 15th year. As in, you need to apply the interest for the 14th year before you withdraw the . This problem has several steps and is most easily solved in reverse. First you need to figure out what principal A you need to withdraw for 5 years. Second, you need to figure out what principal B you need with 8% interest over 2 years to reach principal A. Lastly, you need to find what annuity payment needs to be made each year for 12 years to reach principal B. That will be your answer. 

Can a univariate model like ARIMA represent a rational expectations equilibrium? Not really. Most economics theory employ rational expectations that lead to a nonlinear system of equations (in multiple variables) that describe the model's dynamics. Often, these are approximated (e.g., log-linear approximation), so that they can be solved and estimated using something like a linear state space model---but many still require multiple variables (here, arranged in a vector) to describe the full dimensionality of the model. For an example of one particular model that uses rational expectations, see p. 30 of "Recursive Models of Dynamic Linear Economics" by Hansen and Sargent. 

Are there any criteria that I'm missing? Also, if we take into account potential general equilibrium effects (like the effect on wages), does the analysis change? 

Why is income from capital gains taxed differently than wage income? There are perhaps historical, practical, and theoretical reasons. What are they? (As far as historical reason go, I'm asking primarily about the United States. If anybody has any insight about this topic in other countries, I'd love to hear it as well.) 

If you want to describe excess returns in terms of exposure to common risk factors, you want the risk factors to be orthogonal. However, if you have $k$ factors with no perfect collinearity, you can always orthogonalize them and use those. You then call the orthogonalized factors the risk factors. 

The only argument that I think can be made is that immigrants often don't consume similarly to Americans. Large amounts of salaries are sent home from the US by immigrants which means that money is now out of circulation. Additionally, coming from poorer countries with a lower standard of living it can be argued that immigrants will choose to live a lower quality of life in the US which again could cause a decrease in Economic activity in the U.S. Lastly, for illegal immigrants wage/labor restrictions don't always apply to them meaning that U.S workers who are protected by these restrictions now have to compete with workers who do not have those restrictions which can drive down U.S employment and wages for workers across the board. With that said, I think immigration as a general rule increases economic growth in the long run. 

GNP (Gross national product) measures all of incomes of every citizen in a country. This means that if I as a citizen have a business outside of my home country my income from that business still applies to the GNP. GDP, which is the more common measure is the measure of all economic activity within a country's borders. Meaning that my income from my foreign company would not be counted towards GDP. GDP is generally used as the standard for economic activity because it provides a good look into what is going on within a country's borders, without potentially inflating economic activity of a country by looking at foreign investments. 

does not work for column (2). It gives results that are different from the book. Could someone explain how to obtain these standard errors in Stata? Note that the data to go along with this question can be found here: $URL$ Alternatively, you can load it directly into Stata using 

Here's my best guess. I haven't checked to thoroughly if this is right, but maybe it will help. Evolution of population density I understand the model as follows. $f(a,t)$ is the density of people of age $a$ at time $t$. Suppose at time $t=0$, the density of the population is $f_0(a)$. To model the aging process as well as the mortality rate, the density $f$ must evolve over time so that it satisfies the condition that you derived. Thus, $m$ must satisfy the following partial differential equation $$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial a} + d(a, t) f(a,t) = 0 $$ and the initial condition $$ f(a,0) = f_0(a). $$ I believe that PDEs of this form can have relatively straightforward solutions depending on the functional form chosen for $d$. Here are some cases. Case 1: Constant mortality rate, $d(a,t) = d_0$. Suppose a constant mortality rate, $d(a,t) = d_0$. Then (using Mathematica), 

If anything the is too high. There are many people in rural communities within which they earn 0 income given the fact that they are subsistence farmers and don't hold a job. The per year minimum is to state that it is impossible for anybody to subsist on 0 per day and that if someone in official statistics is recorded with an income of 0 per day then in all likelihood there is unrecorded income from subsistence farming and non-market activity. The a year salary isn't all that unreasonable considering the kind of poverty many people live in. Nearly 1.1 Billion people live in absolute poverty () which annualized is a salary of . It's quite reasonable to assume that some large percentage of those individuals make less than that which means there are millions who live on less than which the annual income would imply. 

Legally what you are describing is bartering, i.e: exchanging goods or services for other goods or services. According to the U.S IRS bartering counts as taxable income and must be reported on tax forms for the fair market value of the product as income. ($URL$ While in practice some kid mowing his neighbors lawn who gets paid in cookies probably can get away with tax avoidance in the same way that waiters can get away with not reporting their cash tips as income if the entire system shifted over to bartering rather than using USD you better believe the IRS would step up their enforcement. Basically, it doesn't matter what is being exchanged for goods and services for tax purposes. What matters is the fairmarket value of the exchange. So if I give you 1 bitcoin for doing my taxes then the gov't will tax you the same as if I paid you in the fair market value for bitcoins ($1127.90 at present rates) (Edit: This obviously only applies to the U.S but I imagine most countries have similar regulations to get around this exact loophole)
