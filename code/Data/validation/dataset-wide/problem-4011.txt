A partial answer for transpositions: If $A$ contains a generating set given by transpositions, there is an $n-$cycle given by the product of $n-1$ generators. Indeed, consider the graph $G$ with vertices $1,\dots,n$ and edges defined by all transpositions in the generating set $A$. The subset of transpositions in $A$ generates $S_n$ if and only if $G$ is a connected graph. Up to throwing away a few generators, we can thus assume that $G$ is a tree. Drawing this tree in the plane and choosing an initial leaf of $G$, we consider the product of all transpositions corresponding to the order in which we encounter the edges of $G$ when walking around $G$ in counterclockwise order. This defines the $n-$cycle obtained by writing down all vertices of $G$ accordingly to their last sighting during the walk. 

Given $k$ strictly positive real numbers $l_1,\dots,l_k$, can one decide the existence of a periodic tiling of the plane whose fundamental domain is the union of $k$ squares of length $l_1,\dots,l_k$? For $k\leq 2$, such tilings exist always. How can one construct them in case of existence? (Fun example: given a natural integer $n$ are there always (at most) four such lengths given by non-negative integers $a,b,c,d$ with $n=a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$?) Added: One can always decide the existence theoretically since there are a finite number of possible graphs (given by boundary of squares) on the resulting quotient-torus. This is however not usable in practice. 

I guess the series expansion for the partition number $p(n)$ by Rademacher (see $URL$ ) is a nice illustration. The number $p(n)$ is obviously an integer which is uniquely defined by enough terms of Rademacher's formula. 

Can the number of points at integral distance to all three points of a non-degenerate triangle of area $A$ be bounded by $1+cA$ for some suitable constant $c$? Remark: Since it is easy to bound this number by $4(D+1)^2$ where $D$ is the diameter of the triangle, a sequence giving rise to counterexamples must consist of very thin triangles. Addendum: Ilya Bogdanov's example shows that the original statement is too optimistic. There are two ways (both suggested in Ilya's answer) to strengthen it: Replace $1$ by a constant or ask the question asymptotically (for $A$ large enough). Both strengthenings are interesting but I prefer the first one: Are there constants $b\geq 2$ and $c$ such that the number of points at integral distance to a triangle of area $A$ is bounded by the affine function $b+cA$ of the area? 

Is there a nice description of all real algebraic curves of $\mathbb R^2$ which have the property that every such curve contains all zeroes (after the obvious identification of $\mathbb C$ with $\mathbb R^2$) of infinitely many monic rational polynomials of $\mathbb Q[z]$ having only simple roots. Examples are the real line, the unit circle and there are many hyperelliptic curves (obtained by taking preimages of such curves with respect to suitable rational functions). (It is of course easy to construct also non-simple examples of such curves, eg. by considering all real lines determined by sets of zeroes of cyclotomic polynomials.) I guess that there exists a curve $\mathcal C\subset \mathbb R^2\sim\mathbb C$ defined by a polynomial in $\mathbb Z[x,y]$ which contains the rootsets of only finitely many rational monic polynomials without multiple roots. Can someone exhibit such a curve? 

(Intended as a comment to Chris Godsil's answer, but too long.) One way of making the last statement in Chris Godsil's answer precise is as follows: Consider a planar graph which is $3-$edge connected. By a famous theorem, it is then the 1-skeleton of a $3-$dimensional polytope. Choose positive weights on edges in such a way that the resulting adjacency matrix plus a suitable diagonal matrix (a Schroedinger operator) has an eigenspace of dimension $3$ for the second-smallest eigenvalue. We need moreover a slightly technical stability condition: the set of all such Schroedinger operators on the graph has to be transversal at the chosen matrix to the set of all symmetric matrices with second smallest eigenvalue of multiplicity $3$ (this is a stability condition allowing for small perturbations). The coordinates of any basis of the second smallest eigenvalue are then the coordinates for the vertices of a $3-$dimensional polytope realizing the graph. (Such a basis should be close to the $2-$nd up to the $4-$th smallest eigenvectors, thus Chris Godsil's remark. There are also partial generalization of this construction related to graphs with Colin de Verdiere number higher than $3$. 

It is perhaps useful to restate your problem as the obviously equivalent problem of minimizing $-\gamma_1/\gamma_0$ where $x^n+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\gamma_ix^i$ is the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in the set $\{\sum \alpha_i\mathcal I_i,\sum \alpha_i=1\}$. Usual numerical methods applied to the rational function (in terms of parameters) $-\gamma_1/\gamma_0$ work perhaps well. It is perhaps also useful to have information on local maxima of $\det(A)=\pm \alpha_0$ for $A$ in your set. Solutions for your problem are perhaps not too far away. 

A gömböc is a $3-$dimensional convex body (having uniform density) which has exactly one stable and one instable equilbrium position (see $URL$ Such a convex body keeps its properties under tiny perturbations. There exists thus a gömböc given by algebraic equations. What is the simplest (small degree and small coefficients) polynomial $P(x,y,z)\in\mathbb R^3$ such that $P(x,y,z)\leq 0$ defines a gömböc? Added after Stopple's remarks: Existence of an algebraic gömböc is not obvious. I should have asked first for existence. Two other questions concerning these objects are: Is the set of all (algebraic) gömböcs connected? Are there any gömböcs in dimension $>3$? (There are none in dimension $2$, every $2-$dimensional convex set has at least $4$ equilibrium points.) 

Remove from $\mathbb N$ the subset $\cup_{n=1}^\infty \lbrace n!,n!+1,\dots,n!+n\rbrace$. The result has density $1$ and arbitrarily large gaps. 

Rook polynomials can be interpreted as generating functions for subsets consisting of pairwise non-adjacent vertices in graphs (such subsets are called independent sets). Indeed, consider the graph with vertices all cases under consideration with edges joining cases having an equal coordinate. The algorithm for computing such polynomials is the same: a vertex either belongs or does not belong to a given independent set and this gives a recursion over subgraphs with either the vertex and all its neighbours removed or only the vertex removed. The torus version does not change anything: moves of rooks on chessboards and on the obvious analogous toric chessboards are the same. Higher dimensional analogues are for instance useful (at least theoretically) for the construction of schedules of schools: one dimension for classes, one for teachers, one for classrooms and one for time-slots. Queen's and King's problems can of course be solved similarly by considering a graph with edges joining all adjacent cases (King) or all cases related horizontally or diagonally (Queen). 

Not an answer but similar examples for sharpening tools: Consider all $2^6=64$ possible decorated regular triangles where a decoration is a set of segments joining the center to some vertices or to midpoints of some edges. Identifying such a triangle with its opposite (through a central symmetry), one can try to tile the regular triangle obtained by inflating a standard regular triangle by a factor $8$ with all $8^2=64$ possible forms (up to translation and central symmetry). The obvious compatibility requirement is: each decorating segment continues in a straight way at a vertex or at a midpoint. I ignore whether there are solutions and how many but the complexity of this problem is exactly between the original baby version (with $16$ squares) and the hard version (with $256$ squares). Another intermediate problem is given by considering regular cubes: joining the midpoint (barycenter) by segments to midpoints of a subset of faces one has again $2^6=64$ different decorated cubes and one can ask for tilings of the $4\times 4\times 4$ cube using all $64$ possible decorated cubes. (This non-planar version is of course more difficult to visualize.) This example can of course be generalized to higher dimensions: The next case involves $256=4^4$ different decorated hypercubes of dimension $4$. In the general case, we have $2^{2d}=4^d$ possible decorated $d-$dimensional hypercubes and we want to tile a $4\times 4\times\cdots \times 4$ hypercube of dimension $d$ using all possible decorated hypercubes in a consistent way (all decorations go on at midpoints of facets). 

A (probably not very brilliant) partial answer to the first question. The following definition of infinite association scheme semi-rings makes sense: A set $A_i,i\in\mathcal I$ (with $\mathcal I$ not necessarily finite) of infinite matrices (indexed by $\mathbb N$ or $\mathbb Z$) with coefficients in $\{0,1\}$ containing the infinite identity matrix such that $\sum_{i\in \mathcal I}A_i=J$ where $J$ denotes the infinite all $1$ matrix and $A_iA_j=\sum_{k\in\mathcal I}\gamma_{i,j}^kA_k$ with $\gamma_{i,j}^k$ in $\mathbb N\cup\lbrace\infty\rbrace$ and where the last sum is finite. We require moreover the equalities $\gamma_{i,j}^k=\gamma_{j,i}^k$. All operations are then well-defined on the semiring $\sum_{i\in\mathcal I}\lambda_i A_i$ of finite sums with coefficients in $\mathbb R_{\geq 0}\cup\{\infty\}$ and can even be extended to infinite sums (this is useful since the Hadamard product identity, $J$ is an infinite sum). Negative coefficients should be avoided. I am not convinced of the interest of such a structure. 

A matrix realizing Colin de Verdi`eres $\mu$-invariant yields an answer if you accept that you get lengths at the end, not at the beginning. A planar graph $G$ arising as the $1-$skeleton of a polytope has always $\mu$-invariant equal to $3$. There exists thus a combinatorial Schr\"odinger operator on $G$ whose second largest eigenvalue has multiplicity $3$ (and the eigenspace satisfies a stability condition). Choose a basis of $3$ eigenvectors for such an operator. Interpret these eigenvectors as $x,y$ and $z$ coordinates of points in $\mathbb R^3$, indexed by vertices of $G$. This yields a set of points in $\mathbb R^3$ which are extremal vertices of a polytope realizing $G$ (and the realization is of course the obvious one, vertices are already labeled by vertices of $G$). Moreover, all convex polytopes realizing $G$ can be constructed in this way. The "moduli space" of such polytopes is thus (up to the choice of a basis) in bijection with Schr\"odinger operators realizing the $\mu$ invariant. 

"Group characters, symmetric functions and the Hecke algebra" by D. M. Goldschmidt is also very nice. And there is of course also the classical "Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials" by Macdonald. In a second time you can also have a look at the Okounkov-Vershik approach (perhaps by reading the original paper "A new approach to representation theory of symmetric groups"). 

Let $\alpha:\mathbb Z\longrightarrow \mathbb Z$ be a quadratic polynomial taking only integral values on the integers and consider the sequence of square-matrices with coefficients $x^{\alpha(i+j)}$ for $i,j\in \{0,\dots,n\}$. The determinant of such a matrix involves a (not nessecarily positive) power of $x$ and a polynomial which factors experimentally always into a product of cyclotomic polynomials. Is this always true or is there a counterexample to this observation? 

This is no answer but a description of an efficient way for computing the cardinality of $S(n)$. I have to post it as an answer since it is too long for a comment. Consider the subsets $U_a(n),C_a(n),L_a(n)$ of $S(n)$ defined as follows: all coefficients of $U_a(n),C_a(n),L_a(n)$ are $\leq a$ and satisfy the additional inequalities $t_i\leq i$ for $U,C$, respectively $t_{n-i}\leq i+1$ for $C,L$. The set $S(n)$ is then in bijection with the union of the trivial element $(0,0,\dots,0)$ with $\cup_{\mu=1}^n\cup_{k=1}^n L_\mu(k-1)\times U_{\mu-1}(n-k)$. Indeed, a non-trivial element $(t_1,\dots,t_n)\in S(n)$ with last index $k$ on which its coefficient takes the maximal value $\mu=\max_i t_i$ gives rise to an element $(t_1,\dots,t_{k-1})$ of $L_\mu(k-1)$ and to an element $(t_{k+1},t_{k+2},\dots,t_n)$ of $U_{\mu-1}(n-k)$. These elements, together with the omitted $k-$th coordinate $t_k=\mu$, determine the initial vector $(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ uniquely. One gets similar recursive decompositions of $U,C,L$ (standing for upper, central, lower) giving rise to recurrence relations among the cardinalities of $U,C,L$ which allow to compute their cardinalities in quadratic time. By the way, here an idea which can perhaps be exploited: Elements of $S(n)$ with no coordinate equal to $0$ are in bijection with a subset (which can explicitely be described) of $\cup_{k=\lfloor n/2\rfloor}^{n-1}S(k)$ as follows: replace every coefficient $t_i$ of such an element $(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ by $t_i-1$ except if $t_i=1$ and $t_{i-1}>1$ in which case you remove it. 

I guess $m>\log(1-p)/\log(1-1/n)$ works since the probability of a faulty system running $m$ times without defect is $(1-1/n)^m$ and this should be smaller than $1-p$. This seems to be a homework type question (and moreover an easy one) rather than a MO-question. 

Mathematical means either useful for Mathematics or based on Mathematics. I guess one has to include the following items: (1) Euclid and LLL (2) Newton and variations based on the existence of attracting fixpoints for maps. (3) Algorithms for linear algebra and, in particular, FFT (4) Simplex algorithm and other algorithms using convexity properties (5) Quadrature formula (integration, differential equations etc.) (6) Factorization (integers, polynomials etc.) and primality proving (7) Algorithms for computations with Groebner bases. (8) Sorting and searching (9) WZ and similar algorithms yielding automated proofs This list is surely a strict subset of a satisfying answer. Which important (classes of) algorithms are missing? (I guess there must be also be something in probability and perhaps in geometry.) Let me also specify that I would like the list to contain general-purpose algorithms, not algorithms for specific tasks, like encryption, error-correction, computations of class numbers for number fields etc. I guess, algorithms for elliptic curves are on the boundary and perhaps already slightly outside the list (many of them are however used for integer-factorization and are thus implicitely contained in item (6) of the previous list). A last question: Are we missing important fundamental algorithms? (This is of course tricky, since we are probably not aware of their potential usefulness). By this I do not mean a algorithm for factorizing integers in polynomial time or an (impossible) algorithm deciding the existence of solutions for arbitrary Diophantine equations but algorithms useful for a large class of problems for which we have presently only case by case tricks.ge
