Are you familiar with Noxus from the League of Legends video game? That might be a good place to start mining for ideas. Summed up, it's something like Brutal Darwinian libertarianism. Anyone can be anything they want, regardless of the station that they were born into. If you want something you take it through strength or cunning. Either your strong enough to hold on to your position or you're assassinated, stolen from, or enslaved by a competitor. Strongest rise to the top, the weak are pushed down, and there's a lot of churn and turn over. As long as the murder rate isn't out of control and the birth rate is high enough, it should be a stable society. And remember, you don't have to kill someone to take their stuff or status - if they are evil sociopaths it might be better just to inflict suffering. 

I like the idea of a six limbed body plan. If your thing has four legs and two wings it can be more of a hawk, where it uses it's wings to travel but hunts by pouncing from the air and then is basically a lion on the ground. Long jumps for chasing sure. Even powerful enough to carry plenty of weight by the air back to the nest after its made its kill - sure. But don't expect it to be agile or graceful, this is a land predator that can fly. Contrary-wise you can also have the falcon version of this animal that hunts other flying things (this is an and, not an either or) that has four wings and two stubby talons for ripping up whatever it can catch. This thing would be very fast and maneuverable in the air. You are looking at creating a whole new taxonomy of griffin like creatures. There's a lot of room here to design what you like. 

The two cores would coalesce due to gravity. You cannot have an "orbit" in an environment with friction, i.e. in a planetary body. One solution would be to have the magnetic i.e. ferrous cores suspended in a super-core of non-magnetic material of higher density than the ferrous cores. The material would need to have the following properties: 

It is very likely that future civilizations will keep different time measurement scales for different events in spacetime. For religious ceremonies each religion would need to decide if the ceremonies are to be performed as per local time of the person, or as per the time of some specific location such as Earth. Note that we already have discrepancies here on Earth now, for example the Muslim year is shorter than the Gregorian year by I think 12 days. Thus, when a Muslim tells you that he is 65 years old, he may have been born only 63 years ago by the Christian way of counting years. The marking of anniversaries such as independence days, birthdays, remembrance ceremonies, and marriages would likely be done by the local time for the places or the people. Titan may celebrate 2 independence days for every 120 times that India celebrates its independence. However, an Indian on a spaceship to Alpha Centari and back may need to celebrate 15 Indian independence days during his 700 day voyage due to time dilation. During that time, his parents only celebrated their child's birthday twice for the 15 years they were waiting for his return. Legal privileges and responsibilities such as drinking age and driving age will need to be coordinated with the time dilation experienced by the person. Perhaps national ID cards will have a timekeeping device, similar to how radiation workers wear dosimeters today. Activities that must be performed on a schedule will need their time computed as per the location where that activity takes place. The seasons of a planet do not change just because the farmers travel to other star systems. The planning to return to some planet in order to tend to the crops in season there will have to be coordinated to happen once each time the planet revolves around its sun. I imagine that we will need computers to help us calculate when the events take place, and when we must leave our current destination in order to get to the proper location at the proper time, taking both distance and expected travel velocity into account. 

So normal everyday humans use bioreactors called mitochondria to generate energy. They literally burn fuel, reacting fats and sugars with oxygen and use the heat generated to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The energy from burning food is stored in the transition from ADP to ATP. ATP goes where it's needed and the energy is released by converting back to ADP. I recall from biology that ADP is like a spring or grip crusher, and the addition of an additional phosphate group twists the molecule into a high energy configuration - like compressing a spring and locking it. Pop the lock and let it decompress to release the energy. I'm thinking that that's more analogy than how it physically works, however, one of the answers on quora did mention that the ATPase moves like a water wheel when the extra phosphate group is added or removed. So how to mess with this? Go from chemical mitochondria to nuclear powered ones and just flood the body with ADP/ATP to handle the increased energy production and use. You'd never get tired - like a hyperactive kid in the throes of an intense sugar rush, but you might start running into issues of over heating or parts of the body wearing out due to overuse since they aren't used to having and endless supply of energy. So if you start making additional mods to handle those issues, might as well take it one step further and replace the ADP/ATP with a different molecule that can store much more energy. This will help with moving more energy more quickly for, say, explosive movements. 

Of all the solutions yet posted, I do not see any mention of expanding the habitable zone such that two planets with long, slightly-different orbital periods would both fit. This would require a very luminous star, I believe doubling the luminosity (average over wavelengths) would triple the distance to the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone. Our solar system has two planets (Uranus and Neptune) at 20 and 30 AU, which are in conjunction about once every 170 years. To expand the habitable zone from it's current 0.7 AU to 1.5 AU boundaries, we need a star about 8-10 times as luminous as the sun. Assuming that the star is the same colour as the Sun that would be a class IV subgiant, which would be too short-lived for life to evolve on, but could theoretically support human life that arrives there for millions of years. These are not uncommon stars, so it is completely plausible that humans find and colonize one if they are out colonizing anyway. If you need to allow for longer or shorter periods between when transfer between the planets will be possible, then you can adjust for star brightness and change the size of the habitable zone accordingly. In the interest of realism, make sure that your chosen brightness falls in an area on the Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram with the same colour as the Sun (above or below it on the diagram) in a relatively dense part (i.e. no Sun-coloured 100 luminosity stars). 

You could go the midichlorians route (sorry for prequel reference). Idea being that some ancient civilization genetically engineered people with this blood magic ability as you described. That civilization collapsed and after a new one was built in the millennia that followed, the the use of this baked in ability was outlawed. You could also go the route of an infectious nano-tech "disease" being responsible for the blood magic. In this case the source doesn't have to be an ancient galactic civilization. It could be something that the current galactic civilization spread by accident, or something that they encountered as part of their expansion and then inadvertently spread throughout the galaxy (despite their best efforts to contain it). 

I think the answer is "of course." What that looks like is somewhat up to you. So an example that came to mind is the character Tali from one of the Mass Effect games - this is from memory and it's been a while... but the gist was that her species was kicked off their homeworld by AI that they'd created and lived in space for generations. As a whole species their immune systems eventually become compromised and they can't interact with any other race without wearing a protective suit. That's sort of interesting and addresses the issue of races that might be poisonous to one another, but doesn't have a huge impact in terms of how they might interact. To be perfectly fair humans generally wear a limited protective suit (clothes) as a rule when interacting with others and that doesn't seem to limit things much. The idea of the invisible aliens is really fun, but probably still falls under the same sort of reasoning. You would be able to know that there was intelligence based on the fact that stuff that doesn't seem to be naturally occurring is happening - like seeing a spaceship, the land (or a star or a nebula) being worked into the equivalent of a city, or one of your buds taking a predator laser to the chest. For interaction and communication you'd need to work out some system where you are both manipulating something that you both can see, using special sensors or using some sort of indicator to say "I'm here" like the invisible man wearing visible glasses. 

Note that on the surface of the planet the location of the north and south magnetic poles would not change, in fact a system with such high angular momentum would seem to be more stable than our current magnetic fields which do in fact wander. The field lines would be about the center of rotation of the two cores. If you want eccentric magnetic fields on the planet, then you might want to consider a more liquid core. This is completely plausible, and you could have phenomenon in which multiple poles appear for a few years or decades. I would suggest giving the planet a thicker atmosphere to protect the inhabitants, and don't give it a moon so that the planet's wobble will be more eccentric. 

The immortal may become an "Adam" or "Genghis Khan" in the sense that he may sire a large portion of the population. Adam is recognised by the Abrahamic faiths as the father of all men. Genghis had 500-1000 direct offspring by most accounts. This immortal being, by fathering one child every ten years, will have by the time that the story takes place fathered as many children as Genghis Khan. Those children will have many children as well. Being spread out across the centuries, the immortal being will likely be an ancestor of almost all living beings. 

Here's a pic or two showing the skeletal and muscular structure of a bird wing. You can see the hands (metacarpals = bones in the meaty part of your hand, and phalanges = fingers) are largely fused and vestigial in birds. You could make a race of birdfolk where the hands were still usable and human-like. The only caveat would be that the fingers are fingers, not feathers (they might have small feathers so there's no exposed skin, but they aren't flight feathers aka remiges). Also, the wings might need to be a little oversized for the bird-person since the hands aren't helping with the flying and this wing design is probably less efficient for flight than a real bird's. You could also go the other way, and say that they can only fly poorly with limited agility and for short distances relative to a bird. PS I learned the word remiges today thanks to this question 

Definitely done this with a funnel, powdered sugar, and a propane burner. Fun, fun. For the dragon, just have it spit out some aerosolized liquid through a special gland in its mouth - maybe even pyrophoric, which means it ignites when it makes contact with air. So no spark is needed. If it flares up big, but doesn't persist it might be more useful to scare off bigger (non-fire breathing) predators, and/or your dragons could be pack hunters that use their fire to scare and corral prey. And of course fire is hot, so even if it's not napalm, it's a good addition to the list of natural weapons along side teeth, claws, horns, and tails. 

When the aliens were led out of bondage in Misr, their deity killed off all the first-born children of Misr. So how would a deity know which house had children to be spared, and which were to be killed? The aliens simply dabbed a bit of ruminant blood on their doorposts to inform the all-powerful that this house has children to be spared. To this day the aliens celebrate how their children were spared by placing not blood, but a parchment, on every door. Tradition dictates that they honour this parchment each time they pass through a doorway by placing it close to their heart. And since it would be such a pain to take down the parchment, hold it to the chest, and place it back again each time they go through a doorway, instead they simply touch the parchment with the sixth finger of their left hand, which conveniently has an artery coming directly from the heart. Since the aliens use their left hand to honor the parchment, they must always go through the door in a specific direction. The parchment must always be on their left.
