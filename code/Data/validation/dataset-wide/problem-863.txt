Once you have a well calibrated stellar evolutionary program, it's not too difficult to apply that program to our Sun. There will be some unknowns and some variance, e.g., we might not know the physical extent of the red giant phases' expansion, but we know it will happen. 

Note: As I said at the start, thing's are vastly more complicated than I've presented. For example, we assumed that $v^2/c^2 \ll v/c$. In reality, to get a more correct answer, you wouldn't want to drop this term and you'd find that $v_r \ne 2v_p$ as you've indicated in your answer, and there's actually more to it than that. This is all further exacerbated by the fact that the doppler equation I started with already had some assumptions built in. The fully correct equation is more complicated than that. 

It has a large collection of free papers. You may have heard of or even use arxiv, which is a great resource, but very often the papers on arxiv are versions which are pre-publication and not the officially peer-reviewed and published papers. ADS usually has the official published papers (and links to arxiv versions!). ADS has another hugely important feature. It lists article citations and articles which have cited that article. 

What they mean is that asteroids (and comets), rather than forming by successive growth via accretion of many small particles, seem to just clump together into larger bodies, completely bypassing the formation of many smaller meter-sized asteroids and comets (that's not to say there aren't meter-sized objects). You can actually see this in their various plots (fig. 4 for example). Much like the stellar IMF, the power law drastically changes once you get to small sizes and the power law which applied for larger sizes is no longer applicable. At which size the general power law no longer becomes applicable depends upon certain tunable parameters. Cuzzi et al. shows many different results with their tunable parameters set to many different possible values. 

Air mass relates to how much of the Earth's atmosphere the light from an observed object must pass through before being observed. At Zenith, and sea level, the value of "air mass" is set to 1. Light from objects lower to the horizon at an observing site must travel through more atmosphere, and hence the brightness of the object is somewhat diminished. In this situation the value of air mass increases above 1.000, presenting greater dimming for the observed object from increased atmospheric light scattering. As example, when making precise observations of the magnitude of an object in astronomy, there is a need to calculate the air mass for an object at the time of observation, determined in large part by its altitude angle from zenith, or from the geometric horizon. There are various formulas for calculating air mass. Precise calculations consider several factors and can be quite complicated. For more details see - Air Mass (Astronomy). Wikipedia. My question: Is there a simple formula to calculate the air mass at Zenith (only), for observing sites about sea level. Such a calculation provides a comparison of the merit of an observing site at higher elevation over one at lower elevation in regard to the factor of air mass. I imagine for most elevations the factor is quite small. Naturally there are plenty of other factors to consider when it comes the the quality of an observing site - humidity, frequency of clear skies, human light sources and light pollution, etc. To my understanding, the atmosphere in most calculations is considered to be 9 km in thickness. A very simple calculation could be the site elevation subtracted from 9 km, divided by 9 km, providing a ratio value somewhat less than 1. However this calculation does not account for the changing density of the atmosphere with increasing elevation. If there is a simple formula, what is it? 

Various missions such as WMAP and the Planck Satellite have measured the mass-energy content of the universe. You tend to see images like the one below produced by these scientific ventures. 

You can download a normalized solar spectrum with 0.1 nm resolution from here. However this is not at zero airmass. A solar spectrum with zero airmass can be found on this website with the direct link to their data in an excel sheet here. This spectrum appears to be at a 1 nm resolution. 

Galactic Standard of Rest (GSR) Now it is important to understand how the LSR coordinate frame is defined, because the Galactic Standard of Rest (GSR) is defined with respect to the LSR. You can read about it here, but in effect, the LSR is a non-inertial coordinate frame co-rotating with the rotation of the galaxy. The GSR is defined in the same way, but removes that co-rotation by subtracting out the rotational velocity of $220\:km/s$. In the LSR frame, another star's velocity would essentially be with respect to our Sun but in the GSR, the star's velocity would be with respect to a fixed point in the galaxy and be a summation of that star's motion with respect to our Sun and it's orbital motion around the galaxy. Galactic Rest Frame (GRF) The GRF is identical to the GSR, although I've heard GSR more often. In this paper, you can see they define the GRF to be 

Step 3: Backtracking and Forwardtracking Once you've found a good source (such as the two papers above), you don't want to stop there. There's likely more or better papers and you can use the papers you have to find new ones. What you want to do now is take a look at all the papers your current source has cited, and look at all the papers which cite your current source. ADS very conveniently gives you all this information. The Lada 2006 source is 10 years old at this point so I wanted to see if there was anything more recent. I was able to click on the "Citations to the Article" link on ADS for that article, and found the list of 217, more recent papers which cited the Lada paper. Scanning through this list I found two promising papers: Stellar Multiplicity of the Open Cluster ASCC 113 (Guerrero et al. 2014) An Adaptive Optics Multiplicity Census of Young Stars in Upper Scorpius (Lafreni√®re et al. 2014) From here, just rinse and repeat until you've got the information you want. Results I found four papers which appear to give some or all of the information you want. 

As reported in this science article X Marks the spot Centre of Milky Way, a X shaped feature is confirmed centered on our galaxy's centre, when looking on from within the plane of the Milky Way. In terms of the presented explanation of this feature in this article, I would think the X shape could also be explained by historical influence on star formation, and to a degree star type, of polar outflowing material from the central galactic black hole. At least assuming, if it were true, that its rotational axis over the eons of growth has varied about the axis perpendicular to the plain of the Milky Way. I am suggesting a precession type movement over its lifetime, rather like that of earths rotational axis. The orientation of its rotational axis impacted by large mass inflows at various ties, in particular early in its life when in falling mass to black hole total mass ratio was lesser than present times. I would think there would also be likely some gravitational interaction, like wobble, of the inner swirling mass of the interstellar material within the galactic plane as the mass of the central black hole increases non-uniformally with episodes of in-falling material, such as during earlier galaxy mergers as part of our galaxies formation process. Outflow of material from the black hole, high energy particles of mass and radiation, would from my understanding have influence on stellar formation from changing the characteristics of the interstellar material from which the stars are later formed, as well as the effects of compression of material triggering gravitational collapse for star formation. In terms of a precession type movement of a rotational body within a medium, the X shape seems so distinctly characteristic. It seems to be a self evident logical possible explanation to consider. At least from a non-professional and intuitive point of view! Yet such is not mentioned as explanation in the article. Why should such a model be excluded as explanation for this X feature? 

This will take about 2 trillion years. Given everything we know now, it's not too hard to predict the eventual fate of the universe. Of course there may be some changes as our knowledge advances, but I think the general course of events will occur as we expect them to. Based on our current knowledge, if you run through the math, you find that after about 2 trillion years from now, the expansion of the universe will have made it so that all by the closest galaxies will no longer be visible to us. You do ask two separate questions, but they're more or less the same question. They might not occur precisely at the same time, but predictions of the future aren't precise enough to distinguish such a small time difference. By the way, you can read more about the future of the universe on Wikipedia, and specifically this section as it relates to your question. 

I'm sure there are plenty of arguments that could be added to the list, but that's a good start I think. 

In the above, ACS is the Advanced Camera for Surveys and NICMOS is the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer. That, I think, is the basic answer to your question, but there's a few interesting and related points I'd like to point out. First, the HUDF image was actually comprised of many individual images rather than a single 10-day exposure image (as the quote indicates). This would necessarily have to be the case, even if Hubble had the ability to stare at the HUDF region of the sky for 10 days without interruption. Cameras work by taking in light. The Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) which actually collects the light (and converts it to an electric charge) can only hold so much charge before it becomes saturated. At some point, you have to "stop recording" and read out the CCD which clears the accumulated charge. That way, you can resume again with a fresh slate. A 10-day continuous exposure would have easily saturated Hubble's CCD. So even if Hubble did spend 10 continuous days observing this patch of the sky, it would have been broken into many, many smaller exposures. This means, even if the Moon did get in the way during part of such a 10-day exposure, they could have just not made any observations during that time. The other related fact I wanted to point out is that Hubble has something known as the Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ). This is a region of the sky which is never obscured by the Earth, Moon, Sun, etc. as Hubble orbits. As the name implies, it allows for continuous viewing, without interruption. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) (the precursor to the HUDF) was observed in this region. However, there are reasons why you wouldn't want to observe in this region such as it being polluted by "Earthshine".
