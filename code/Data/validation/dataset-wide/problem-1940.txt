I'd make it polite and to the point, thanking them for the opportunities that they have offered you. Make sure to leave professionally. I find this a helpful template: 

Welcome to workplace. Wow, what a hard choice to make. All I can offer you is advice based on my experience. I switched career paths a couple of years ago from I.T. support to Programming. I trained in support and went down that path throughout my schooling, always thinking it was what I wanted until I got in the job and realised it was nothing like I thought it would be. But I taught myself how to program and used to do it as a hobby. I really enjoyed it. I have absolutely no qualifications in programming. What I do have is a job I really enjoy, 2 years commercial experience and more years when it was just a hobby. For me, the lesson I learnt from all of that was having an education is good; having real world working experience is so much more valuable. I see so many job adverts saying you must have x, y and z qualifications that I could happily apply for without them because I know my experience would back me up. I know I have the examples I can show them of what I have done and what I currently do that will blow anyone with just those qualifications away. So whilst this answer is entirely based around my own experience, when I see your choice I know exactly what I would do in your situation; in fact it's an easy choice for me. I'd take the job. Several years experience at a Silicon Valley company will do more for your career than any degree. And the fact that you walked into that job without a degree will speak volumes to potential future employers. 

A friend of mine was recently laid off from a contracting gig. It was made clear from the beginning when he was first offered the role that it was a "high risk" position in the sense that both the role and the project itself were on shaky ground and there was a high chance that the engagement might not last for more than a few months. He weighed his options and decided to give the role a try anyway (The long term rewards if the project did work out were worth it). Last week (after 4 months) it was decided that they would not continue with him (which he was sort of expecting since the project hadn't been doing well), but they didn't give him a few days notice or even a few hours notice. Instead the person he reported to and an HR rep just walked up to his desk and asked him to leave on the spot, the didn't even let him touch his laptop. They did say that his dismissal had nothing to do with his performance or anything, he was doing his job well, but the company had changed strategy. So why couldn't they be nice about it? Even when people are laid off or dismissed for performance reasons, they are at least given to the end of the day to leave. Being asked to get out there and then and being escorted out like that made look like he had done something wrong when in fact the dismissal had nothing to do with his performance. To make things worse, he works in a highly specialized field with only a small number of companies in his city. People would have noticed the abrupt departure and rumors are bound to spread that something bad had occurred, thus negatively effecting his future career prospects. Is there anything he do about this? How can he repair the damage to his reputation? Is there anything he can ask for from his ex-employer to mitigate this? 

As with most things in the professional world, honestly and politely. It seems you feel bad for the other firm for all the work they've put in trying to get you. My advise to you is stay detached in these situations; don't feel guilty about having to turn down the job no matter what they've done for you. You have to do what is right for you, just as the company will do what is right for it. You don't have to tell them you have another offer that is better if you don't want to. You can simply tell them that you no longer wish to pursue their offer. You can of course tell them you need more time to consider and put them off a little to make sure you definitely get the local job, and if that falls through go with the foreign one. But once you have the local job secured, just be straight up with the foreign company. Thank them for the offer but tell them after all considerations you've decided not to take their offer. They'll probably ask why and it's at that point you can either say "I'd prefer not to answer that." or "I've taken a different job more local to me.". Whichever you choose, remember not answering them is more preferable to lying to them. Just stay honest with them and you should be fine. 

If you think you lack the experience for the position then you're not going to get it. That's not the mindset you want to be going into an interview with. Just because you're out of school and not going to College doesn't mean you lack the education to be a software developer. Have you got any experience in the languages you are applying for or are you applying for entry level positions that don't expect you to know the language? This question makes a difference. If they don't expect you to know the language, then education isn't a massive factor in terms of the language. Your school grades will count but what will count more is how you think, do you have a logical approach to solutions, do you know any similar language? That's more important in a prospective entry level position where they are going to teach you. You need to show that you are receptive, eager to learn and most importantly, capable of learning. If you're going for a position where you are expected to know the language, again you don't have to have a college degree, but you will have to demonstrate command of the language. Do you have code samples you can show them? Build a portfolio, even a small one, of sample programs and code you've written. Have you worked on open source initiatives? Great, show them you've contributed; this is all experience. Not everything has to be about your school work for a school leaver. 

They have been unresponsive in my attempts to communicate with them. And from the way they talk to us, and from rumors circulating around the company grapevine, I get the impression that we are looked down on as mere technicians supporting an obsolete legacy app compared to the cutting edge development work they are doing. I also feel that the company higher-ups have a similar impression of our respective teams. Questions: 

Adding to what Danny Newman said, it is not (that) hard to bring yourself up to par in terms of coding. Coding is more like a sport or a musical instrument than like theoretical skills, practice, practice, practice, practice! You are thirty and a post-doc. Unless you have a family and kids, you definitely have enough time to practice coding. You will find that it is not only beneficial for your career, but it is also fun. Finally if an up and coming professor was willing to hire you and extend your contract for 3 years, you must have some level of competence or skill, so don't sell yourself short. 

I work as part of a tech team team that handles database applications for various business statistics. Our database platform is somewhat dated, but the business application that runs on it uses sophisticated statistical methods and generates very complex models. There's a data science team at my company, who are supposed to be the "mad scientists/skunk ops" group, and are developing algorithms that perform the same business function that our teams' software performs. They are using the latest trendy development tools and languages and running their code on the cloud as opposed to on physical servers. However, the actual models they are generating are rudimentary and they are nowhere near achieving the functionality or scale that our application is capable of, despite how dated our platform is. Moreover, both myself and my team have more experience with the business area that we are working on than they do. I want to collaborate with them for two reasons: 

I work in a software company. I am one of the senior-most developers with good knowledge of DevOps practices. For example, not intended to show my pride, I was the one who twice convinced the boss to switch from CVS to SVN to Git. Often I get interrupted by coworkers about technical problems they cannot solve. I understand that in a transitional phase some recurring problems may occur and it is a friendly idea to help other coworkers. However this led to other developers being lazy and treating me like the help desk. I often (this happens since years) get interrupted by people, or get mails, asking for the solution to a very specific technical problem for which the offender did not show any research. I mean he/she got struck in a Git error (to make an example) and instead of Googling he/she directly reported to me, CCing senior staff members who likely do not know the answer. Sometimes, in order to encourage Googling and Stackoverflowing, I called those people to my desk, opened my browser and started a search with them. I wanted to show I am no magic well, no guru, no professor. It is true that in the past I fixed a lot of problems in a few seconds time thanks to having experienced them myself People today still call me for silly problems that a simple Google/Stackoverflow search may solve. In a period I was busy with my own tasks I tried to become unfriendly, answering "I have my stuff to do", "The help desk is open only 30 minutes a day". This resulted in panic and few chats with executive staff (who became aware that staffing me to the help desk could drain my time over the project, jeopardy deadlines, etc.). Today I have got another mail with Cc some senior members who are too busy with their own activities. Note: I interpret ing instead of addressing the mail as an attempt of escalation ("Hey, team leader, I can't proceed until /usr/local/ΕΨΗΕΛΩΝ fixes my problem"). I politely answered "Have you looked or asked on Stackoverflow? I would have done the same". Note 2: we are not motherlanguage English speakers, but there is quite a decent level of English here at least in written form. Question: what kind of attitude or social exercise should I adopt in order to encourage people to first try to solve problems on their own, and then ask other members for advice? And to keep friendly with them. If the staff member proved me to have done some research, instead of vomiting a screenshot on her client, I would have been happier to lift my shiny metal bu** [nsfw] from my chair and go to help.
