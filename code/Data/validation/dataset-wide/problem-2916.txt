But as finite beings, we have a problem Now, what Kant is thinking about is a third class of representations as a problem, like also expressed in this letter already (Ak. 10:131.1-10), but it is better put and adressed in CPR, A 92-93/B 124-126 (Cambridge Edition p. 224). I will quote almost the whole paragraph and make comments to make clear where and why a problem occurs: 

If I have reason I can rationalize my trust, that means I have arguments that enable me to say why I trust in this. If I have reason to trust I have motivation to trust and thus do trust, no matter if I know or even can imagine why or not. 

As for antidotes/electro fink: Causation in a wider sense could be understood as "in most cases". That could be because there are possible intermediating variables, like antidotes interrupting a poisening in progress. But what Hume wants to say is that there is always the threat of one case that cannot be ruled under our laws of nature (or inductive knowledge in general). And that basically is the birth of our modern theory of science: every law of nature must be falsifiable. But they are nevertheless, in theory, thought as a general, necessary claim about how the connection between cause and effect is. Therefore it does not object his statements, because you just picked examples where it is not "causation" in a sense applicable to describe events in nature as they in fact are: Most poisons cause some amino acids to denaturate. That, over time, causes circulatory collapse if the cause "denaturation" is not removed/stopped. This, as long as the cause "denaturation" is not removed and the circulatory collapse made reversable, causes death within a certain period of time. You see the different use of "causing" in the different narratives? The dependence on time and other events? As for equilibriums: "Causation" in a two-way-situation (equilibrium) can be described as "causing each other", but since it is pure potential capacity (as a physical and philosophical term) without actualization, in fact nothing would have been caused. You describe a potential capacity. That's it. Someone/something has to have caused the books to stand against each other or the stable gravitional system, though. Causation traditionally is one form of movement/change since Aristotle's Physics. As an equilibrium is a state, not a change of states, it is simply a strange use of the term "causation" if you describe the situation as if the books would cause each other to stand up. So again, you are using the term in another way. Explaining the usage of "causation" in philosophy: I have used some philosophical terms against your objections that I think I should back up. Causation as a term includes a cause and an effect. The effect is traditionally a change of state, as I wrote above. In addition, causation in a strict sense (like Hume is referring to) means what you could name "direct" causation. Of course, you could say that the murder of Sarajevo caused WW I, but this wouldn't be a proper understanding of causation. But why? That is because of what Kant states (and proofs thereafter!) in the Second Analogy of the Critique of Pure Reason (B232): 

First, we are here not talking about the divine intellect, but an intellect as ours, a finite one (as becomes clear within further quotes). Therefore the representation does "not produce its objects as far as its existance". He here restates the problem as follows: Before even being able to produce something by (or after, through the will) thinking it, it has a priori to be thought as object. The problematic relation would therefore be a relation a priori between a representation and an object by virtue of being an object at all: 

We can rather easily see how the maxim should look like: Being in financial distress [Situation], I shall to give a false promise [means] in order to get money [intention/end]. Kant himself gives the following formulation: 

He has established that the (absolutely) good will has to be necessary and unconditioned before (the first seven paragraphs). He has established per proposition two that we are speaking of a principle of the will, i.e. a general concept. His definition of a law is a proposition that is both necessary and general (see 4:418-20). 

A particular situation A particular intent/end [Zweck] the action is aiming for The particular means/action for achieving the intended outcome (and thus what Kant calls "practical rules") 

TL;DR: The question that asks what the conditions of the possibility of our reference to objects are. There is only one question in transcendental philosophy, but for aspects or classes of objects it may have to be answered differently. I would like to make another answer as a sort of appendix to what @JoWehler wrote, based on his letter to Herz in 1772 in addition to CPR, because it is easy to think that one understands what Kant means and what the problem transcendental philosophy tries to answer is, but another thing to actually understand the whole depth of it. As this question is so important and so very underestimated, it will become quite a long answer. I will translate the letters by myself. First approach towards the question The question as asked already occured nine years before CPR and seems rather innocent (Ak. 10:130.6-8): 

If we talk about sensual representation, it clearly isn't a priori and thus to some extend arbitrary. 

But I do not know about the manuscripts. Sidenote: The first edition (A edition) only had 1000 exemplars, therefore until 1838 (first "complete works" of Kant) every well-known philosopher referring to CPR, except Jacobi (I exclude Garve here, writing the best known review of the first edition of CPR of his time, resulting in GMM as an answer, but not having being attended to afterwards), only read the B edition of 1787 (Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel). That is quite an important fact considering that this was seven years after the death of Hegel and there have been major changes in key texts from A to B edition. We are in a quite comfortable situation today. (source: Prologue of the 25 Years of Philosophy by Eckart FÃ¶rster) 

Meaning others didn't. And the "from" - "to" formulation supports the point made that it is just about a logical inference that may very well suffer under false premises. Remark: One may realise at this point that labelling moral goodness as comparative begs the question of wether there is perfection - there obviously isn't! Because perfection is a term that only works in absolutistic frames! 

The easiest account of this I found is the following by Gadamer, as (re)stated in Philosophical Hermeneutics, p.9: 

In the end, the last sentence is explanatory for the statement just before, i.e. why we will be victims if having to endure one's ugly (i.e. revengeful!) sight if he isn't able to 'attain satisfaction with himself'? Because it makes us (feel) bad and gloomy. The interpretations may vary, but as I take it, feeling bad and gloomy and becoming/being bad (in the sense of degenerated, mean) and gloomy is pretty much the same here. 

Even if it was (by transplant) "a cat's tail" (phenomenological), it would still be Gabriel's tail (i.e. the tail of Gabriel, possessive/as a predicate), and since Gabriel is a wolf, it would be the tail of a wolf, namely of Gabriel the wolf (possessive/as a predicate). Therefore, it is a clean deduction, though perhaps a bit clumsy in the formulation. Addition including the comment of @quen_tin: The reason why the formulation is clumsy is that the fine differences between "tail of a wolf" and "wolf tail" make the difference between deduction and induction or possibly (as this is a single occurence) even more precise: Abduction. 

Hope, thereby, criticises the very idea of common humanity by stating a basic incommensurability of moral plurality. If we want to justify any set of human rights as universal we will, therefore, have to face these (and other) objection(s) regarding finding something that deserves the name "human nature".1 And the more different objections one can argue against the fewer objections remain. Hence, I am looking for more objections like this, no matter from where they come. Question Not that I do not have plenty of literature regarding this already, but maybe there's more somewhere: What are the main lines of argument (and by whom and where) criticising the very idea of a common denominator of humanity (or the human condition) in light of human variation? I am interested mostly in arguments that meet the following criteria: 

Therefore, a good will has to have a principle that is a law. This, together with the arguments he delivers himself after first just stating the proposition, makes it understandable how he can speak of law and respect: 

I think this is a slight misunderstanding. While the Formula of Autonomy (Ak. 434) is in some sense combining the Formula of Natural Law and the Formula of Humanity (see Ak. 436), the "kingdom" of ends (translation problem! "Reich" is defined as "systematic interconnection of rational beings through their laws" (own translation, Ak. 433), kingdom is misleading here!) adds an interpersonal component that reaches further and is thought as a limitational concept [Grenzbegriff] to the kindom of nature [Reich der Natur] in which it should be thought as realizable (Ak. 438). Regarding the actual formula: The difference is, as already pointed out, the systematic interconnection by laws. You may be able to abstract from your subjective standpoint regarding one maxim, thinking it as a law of nature. The same with one maxim considering the end-in-itselfessness of rational beings. But it is another thing to think all this within a system of such laws and individuals. It highlights in some sense the consequences of my recognition as lawmaking in other rational beings. BUT in Ak. 436 it is clearly stated that "these three formulas" are "objectivly-practical" the same. While it is still heavily discussed which three formulations are meant here, it seems clear to me that they all only do highlight one aspect of the concept of the categorical imperative each, but do not loose their essential identity as types of it (the formulation from the later Critique of Practical Reason). So technically speaking, they are all the same and combining them does not add anything. All formulations represent only different ways we can grasp the categorical imperative with intuitions [Anschauungen], by types (this is already implied by the "subjective-practical difference" in the GMM, Ak. 436), as there cannot possibly be any intuition of it as such, because we are not capable of pure intuitions, i.e. we cannot directly apply it in the realm of nature (thought as the sum of all experience) because it does not obey our boundaries of experience (the categories). We have no scheme (Schema) for it in its "perfect", general form. These points are also from the second Critique. Last point, restating and fleshing out the second sentence of this answer after all: The universal moral law is the general rule including all these aspects simply because of its generality, leaving out any specification (Ak. 436-7 and 402/420-1; hence the Foundational Law of Morals in his second Critique), therefore the aspects thought as combined in GMM are the one highlighted in the Formula of Natural Law with the one in the Formula of Humanity (under above mentioned restrictions). Henry E. Allison discusses this topic to some extent in his Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals: A Commentary, but gets to conclusions different from mine in some points. It would nevertheless be a good starting point for further readings. 

A possible and quite influential answer is given in this related question. I will quote the important definition by Allen Buchanan from his essay Political Legitimacy and Democracy (Ethics 112, 4 (July 2002): 689â719): 

The criterion/property of truth must be applicable to all objects. Step three: Incoherence between above definition of truth and necessary properties of a criterion of truth 

As a general answer, all that is linked to "Phenomenology". You could describe this type of philosophy as an attempt to describe and destinguish the contents and mechanics of conciousness. Starting from Husserl, modernized by what is called "philosophy of mind" with Ryle, Nagel and Searle as some examples. For an overview just read the SEP article to phenomenology. 

So if I want a commanding law (=imperative) that is categorical (=general and necessary), it has to have this form because of logical and linguistic reasons. Second section Here, basically the argumentation is more clean, and includes all the explicit definitions that make the argument of the first section easier to understand. First step: Lawfulness of the will This is kind of cheated, as it's in the very definition: 

Without a criterion of truth that can be applied to all cognitions, it is hard to determine the truth value of a cognition, as we would need to do so through cognitions of the object...and these have to be true. We have the problem of getting into an infinite regress here, because all we can know we know through cognition. First step: We need a determinate object 

I will build by answer more on a analytic tradition as it is described in EPM by Wilfried Sellars. This SEP article can be seen as strongly related, but I will more go the line of logic rather than justifiability. First, knowledge, in this tradition, is knowledge of a proposition (including its truth-value). Second, knowledge has two fundamentally different kinds: non-inferential knowledge and inferential knowledge. On non-inferential knowledge Most theorists claim that there must be a basis of inference, may it be atomistic (Russel, sense-data theorists) or that of basic holistic concepts (Sellars). But all of them say that by having a sensual experience, we have a certain kind of knowledge about these sensations that can not be justified by any instance other than our sensual experience of them. That is why they are non-inferential. On inferential knowledge Here, the things are different. This knowledge has to be justified by inference. The main difference, so I think, is that this knowledge has to be represented/representable in terms of a language, while non-inferential knowledge does not even have to be concious (though I am not in line with every philosopher of this tradition here). On understanding Now, what is understanding? I will stick to @virmaior 's terms episteme vs. techne to make this clear. Let's take an example of two chimpanzees having to do a certain sequence of actions in order to get their food. Chimpanzee 1: There are two mechanisms, eventually changing. He has tried out various ways in both cases and eventually learnt what to do. He has become able of getting his food, because he learnt that for mechanism A, there is sequence A and for mechanism B there is sequence B. He learnt techne. This can be expressed in knowing propositions: mA => sA, mB =>sB. Chimpanzee 2: He tried out at mechanism A, too. He learnt what to do. But then something interesting happens: When confronted with mechanism B, he does not try out anymore, he just does what's right. How can we properly describe this? It may be described in terms of propositions, too: He has learnt what action causes which reaction in the mechanism and if the sequence of the mechanism is changed, these relations still hold. But it may also be that the mechanism is not that simple or there has been added another part not known before and he did understand its nature by looking at it, not by knowing the function of each part before. Here, we say something more than propositional knowledge. Here, we have achieved the notion of episteme. My description would be in this example that no. 2 did not only learn the propositional expression mA => sA, but rules of inference. That means that from mB and its properties (also propositional), he knows how to infer the sequence of actions necessary. And I think that this is what makes the difference between techne and episteme. On pragmatism regarding this difference It is the main problem of pragmatism, as I see it: If Dewey is correct and we only make hypotheses about these rules and try them out, there is no room for the difference between pure propositional relations and episteme. This "something more" is questioned. Answers
