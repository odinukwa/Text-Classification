Yes, it is possible, with a very simple example: It is trivial to have evidence that humanity exists. Why humanity exists is an open question in philosophy with no universally accepted answer. 

It's a phrasing that makes you think. It could be that the speaker believes there is an absolute and is lying. The reason for lying is outside of the scope, though convincing you to dislodge yourself from a position in a surrounding debate is one answer. There is, however, another answer. Phrases like "Nothing is absolute, everything is relative" are just strings of characters. They have no more meaning than, say, "gaba go go mona doo da," unless they are interpreted with respect to an individual's interpretation of the language. Only then do they have meaning. This, of course, means the meaning of that phrase must be with respect to something in the speaker's mind. If one assumes that that individual truly does believe everything is relative, then there are only relative things in that speaker's mind -- no absolute things to which the phrase can ascribe a meaning. Of course, what the speaker means in such a context is not sufficiently specified to permit rewriting the phrase in absolute terms with an absolute meaning. 

If anything, it is a demonstration of a limitation of knowledge. Philosophers wishing to deal with it typically either choose one of the three options, or seek to refine their philosophy in a way that makes it less dependent on a need to "know" things. I find the most popular to be declaring a set of basic axioms, such as "I think therefore I am," but its certainly not the only way to go. 

This phrasing is used by different philosophers for different purposes, so one must take the phrase in context. However, in general, it is used in reference to the idea that consciousness is a thing which is separable from other things. Denett argues that consciousness does not exist except as an image which describes the interplay of events within the brain. I use the word image here to avoid the loaded term "illusion." The key factor here is that the image is a depiction of the thing rather than the thing itself. Denett would argue that if one were to take this image and look for it in the real world, we would not find it. Instead we would find the interplay of events in the brain. In this sense, I might argue that his position is that consciousness is to reality as the number 1 is to the series {1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, ...}. It could be viewed as a limit were the process to be continued, but it never actually reaches that point. In his view, the reality never quite reaches the vaunted concept we call consciousness. In this sense, the word illusion is chosen for pragmatic reasons. It instills the correct imagery in the minds of those who believe consciousness exists. For those who agree with Denett, the word must naturally shift meaning, for there is no consciousness to ascribe meaning to the word "illusion." There may be a self-consistent viewpoint regarding how the brain really works such that that phrase is interpreted correctly, but Denett may not call this out with extra words. Other philosophers have used this concept for other reasons. Alan Watts, for instance, argues that no self is truly isolated from its environment. According to him, there is no consciousness which can be isolated from its environment and pointed at to say "this is a consciousness." He argues that "for every inside there is an outside." Thus there is no consciousness outside or isolated from its environment. 

It can be framed as a matter of semantics, but it tends to not be framed that way because the semantics in question are rather profound ones. Concepts such as determinism, freewill, God, and several other concepts are rolled up into the debate. I find there are points of view which make this issue much less profound, reducing it more towards something which someone might call "a matter of semantics" without feeling like they are underestimating it. From some points of view, the mere idea that we could be products of a universe which is governed by unbreakable laws is an affront to freewill, even though they may admit that it would be impossible to tell the difference empirically. From other points of view, they're just different semantics for a word yielding the same result. It all depends on how essential the semantics of some concepts are to your beliefs. For an example of how important such semantics can be, look at science's evolution argument. It is often stated that "evolution is true." Nearly everyone in the science community agrees that "there is a large body of evidence supporting the theory of evolution," but transitioning from that statement to "evolution is true" proves to be a very strong divisive argument. Some, like myself, will argue that such a claim strips the mathematically correct defenses for a scientific claim clear away, forcing one to rely on other sources of reason to defend the claim. Others will argue that the abductive step from one statement to the other is justified (implying they do not need to admit that anyone might think otherwise). Others will emphatically argue until they are blue in the face that there was no abductive step, and that "lots of evidence" is good enough to directly imply "true," and that anyone who tries to slide some Greek words between the two is just trying to play games. All parties will agree that there is no epistomological difference between the effects of the three positions, but there can be downright violent debates as to the semantic differences between the positions. And compared to the question of physicalism vs dualism, the question of evolution is a small fry semantic debate. 

In the bolded statement, you have engaged in inductive reasoning. There is nothing in the original axioms which indicate the truthhood of this statement. You have simply made the intuitive leap to a conclusion. This points out a key to inductive reasoning: it is very often trivial to take an inductive reasoning claim and break it apart into an inductive part followed by a deductive part. Often, when doing so, the inductive assumptions you get to use are smaller and easier to manage. 

A philosopher would note that mathematics has a long history of being able to transcribe a word problem into a mathematical form where each of the elements of the word problem is translated to a corresponding mathematical form, but the resulting form is semantically different. A very common example is translating "If P then Q" into . Many have great trouble with the fact that is true if is false, regardless of 's value. The English phrasing "If P then Q" rarely has this connotation, but the math does. Thus care must be taken when transcribing a word problem into mathematics. The philosopher would argue that the answers to these questions are obvious, and it is only the mathematical formalisms that cause issues. Thus, a philosopher would challenge the formalism. Consider that one must translate phrases like "live forever" into a valid mathematical phrasing. In your self-answer, you used the notation S(n) to be the set of dollars in Scrooge's account after n steps, and we can use that to explore this difficult phrasing. We cannot say S(∞) in traditional ways because ∞ is not a natural number and steps are enumerated by ℕ. This is what I believe you were getting at with "potential infinity." We could use the "limit as n approaches infinity of S(n)," and by the definition of limits, we would see that the intuitive answer holds. The issue you raise is that there should be a one to one mapping between the infinite sets of numbers. However, nothing precludes this. You can say that you added a set of enumerated bills of size ℵ0, and subtracted from it a set of enumerated bills of size ℵ0, and be left with a set of remaining bills of size ℵ0. Just because |A| = |B| does not mean that |A - B| = 0. For an obvious example, consider the difference between the natural numbers and the set of even numbers. Obviously the difference produces the set of odd numbers, yet all three sets have a size of ℵ0. If I were to think of the problem in terms of a set of bills added, A, and a set of bills removed, R, at the end of "forever," I could say that |A| = |ℕ|, and that |R| = |ℕ|, but that does not mean |A-R| = 0 automatically (as seen above). I would need some proof that A=ℕ and R=ℕ or perhaps more generally A={f(n) for n in ℕ} and B{f(n) for n in ℕ}. Coming up with the mathematical phrasing which permits such equivalence (rather than just equal cardinalities) is where you will find the paradoxical results can arise. The notation regarding limits has been recognized for hundreds of years as an acceptable way to resolve these issues, and a philosopher will be very suspect of any other argument. After all, that's the job of a philosopher: to question things everyone else takes for granted.
