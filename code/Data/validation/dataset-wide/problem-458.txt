I assume your question is 'How is it possible that I can still riding upright, even though the headwind is greater than my maximum riding speed?' The answer is: 

Your bike looks like a hybrid, which gives out that you mostly ride in urban area. Adjusting handlebar height is thus beneficial because you are likely to hit 20 mph+. 

Would it be likely for me to break the axle, or the hub, under power pedalling? Have anyone broke their hub or axle using freewheel with inappropriate speed? (Please do not discuss in theory, I would like to see reference or your own experience) 

Short answer: Yes it is safe to ride on it for another thousands of miles. That is the tyre rubbing mark. This happens when the clearance is too little to allow any error in assembling the rear wheel. I have repaired a few carbon frame and happy to tell you that it is very likely that the damage is superficial. It appears to be a smooth surface, which means the worn out part is still at the epoxy/laminating epoxy resin. Just make sure that the wheel is true, and assembled correctly to prevent further damage. 

24mm refers to the diameter of your spindle (the rod connecting the two cranks) You can look for more details on this chart: $URL$ Hope this works for you :-) 

I suspect that the abrasion from road/chainring/cogs is negligible, especially when comparing with other causes. The silica grains (SiO2, present almost everywhere) would be more of a worrying issue than the aluminium oxide, regarding chain wear. The grains are often visible (in sub millimetre size) and easily stick on the chain after a ride on any road surface. These grains create grindings (between chain and cogs/chainrings) and accelerate chain wear. The applied force also plays important roles in chain wear. An incorrect gear would create a large force between chain pins and cog/chainring. A worn chain would create a large (localized) force between (certain) chain pins and cog/chainring. A chain would wear much faster if the applied force to its pins increase. In short, aluminium+stainless combination is almost identical to stainless+stainless combination in gearing (i.e. creating the same amount of debris) . I used to make electric motor with high RPM and the best combination is nylon+metal. The clearance/applied force does have great importance over many other causes of wear. 

I can't comment on whether or not your bike is suitable for use on trails. As for trail in Manchester, Clayton Vale has some blue and red routes. They're not the best trails in the world (or the UK for that matter) but they're the best you'll get anywhere near the city. They're right by the velodrome and the Manchester City FC stadium. Here: 

I'm looking at buying a new single-speed chain and have pretty much settled on getting one of these two: KMC Z510 or KMC Z510 HX but can't figure out what the actually means. The HX costs 37% more (£7.99 vs £10.99) and I'd like to know what that extra £3 actually pays for so I can decide whether it's worth it or not. Any ideas? 

I saw a bike with such a mudguard the other day. It was mounted on the seat tube and stuck straight out horizontally, between the two seat stays, over the brake and then over the rear wheel. I liked the mount point because it means that the top of the seat tube is protected from crud, unlike seat post mounted mudguards. Does anyone know where I can buy such a mudguard? Or who makes one like it? 

I'm thinking of buying 2 identical sets of tyres for my bike, one to fit immediately, and one to keep in the house as a replacement set when the first ones fail. I'm assuming that this could be anywhere from 12–24 months, maybe more. Will the second set of tyres still be in good condition after having been stored for that long? And as a follow-up question, what are the best conditions to store them? 

Upstairs: as Criggie has suggested, carrying on your left (non-drive side to your body) would be cleaner (although my pants are usually black and my bike has a chain guard so I have no problem). I would like to note that if you choose this option, take care not to dirty your sleeve. Holding the seat tube is a little bit awkward, you could try to hold the crank and see if it fits your style. You can also use the other hand, holding the chainstay, to guide/stabilize the bike 

I use this product: $URL$ Since this is a tail light, it is less suspicious as a GPS tracker. You can simply charge and remove the USB cable as well. (One thing to notice since this product is not inexpensive, I epoxied the screw just to be on the safe side :D ) 

From my experience, the answer is no. I have been cycling across the Great Glen and have no problem with mechanical disc brake. My bike was moderately loaded with camping equipment. So the load (including me 70 kg) was around 110 kg or 242 lbs. There were continuous downhill sections but the brake works fine, thankfully. 

1) As in Scotland, I would recommend you to look for a second-hand bike (possibly gumtree is a good place to start with, bear in mind that you need to check and make sure the bike is not stolen). The reason is that in the winter, all the salt on the roads will corrode your bike badly.So go cheap, then keep it as winter bike, then upgrade gradually. Cyclocross would be your choice if you are planning to cycling offroad and over glens. If you are just going to stick along the coast, a road bike would be enough (and pretty fast too, so you can go to Stonehaven, Montrose, even up to Inverness). 2) A road bike as for starter (second hand) is around £100-150 (Carrera Virtuoso for example, I got one for £110, model 2012) A cyclocross for starter (second hand) is around £150-200. The higher price reflects that not many people in Scotland buy/own cyclocross (I have yet to see one cyclocross bike in Dundee). A little search around Aberdeen shows Carrera Crixus selling at around £200. 3) 700c wheel of course :-) 26" will be like a toddler-bike for you Your height is not telling much, but if you are an average guy, 1.82 m would need a 22" (L or 54-56cm), between 21" and 22" also ok-ish. Having said, I'm 1.73 but I need a slightly larger one comparing to my height (20.5" or 52-54 cm), because my back is quiet short, relatively to my legs. 

In Australia there was recently a change to to bicycle helmet standards as outlined in AS/NZS 2063:2008. Basically, helmets complying to the 1996 version of the standard will soon become illegal to sell in Australia. I want to buy a helmet with the 1996 standard because it's cheaper now (due to stock clearance), but I don't know if it will be any less safe? Not that I put too much trust in these standards anyway ... I'm very skeptical as to whether the new standard will be safer in use, because virtually no useful information is given to the public as to what the changes actually are. Furthermore, these are laws being passed by bureaucrats who seemingly have very little idea of the actual science behind these standards! To make matters even worse, they do not differentiate between helmets for different cycling uses e.g. mountain bike vs. road, and throw seemingly arbitrary numbers around. Should I be concerned buying a helmet of an older standard or do you think this just silly bureaucracy in play? 

Lightweight polyester or microfiber materials do the job. Pearl Izumi is my favourite. Bike specific rain jackets are a must if you are looking for comfort. Generally they are very thin and have air vents in them. There is no reason to wear heavy rain jackets. Instead, layer up up with a base layer (often merino wool or synthetic thermals) + mid layer + the shell (which is the jacket). That is probably the most common layup for cyclists and it will keep you warm. 

I read in an issue of a mountain bike magazine (sorry I can't remember the issue or even the magazine), that helmets afford somewhat limited protection. That is not to say that you shouldn't wear a helmet. The study showed that helmets can worsen head injury in crashes involving torque to the brain (i.e. rotational injury). Rotational injury is not like the relatively benign bleeding from simply a scraped scalp (though no head injury should be taken lightly!). Since the brain is not perfectly round but elongated, rotation can happen more easily at a pivot point. Torque injuries are the source of the most serious brain injuries. Also the study seemed to suggest that helmets are most effective at protecting you in high speed crashes and crashes into sharp objects, which is particularly important in mountain biking. At medium to low speed crashes, the helmet's effectiveness was in doubt. Other non-mountain bike specific studies seem to have shown the frequency of head injuries compared to other types of injuries is rare. The statistics can matter in deciding if helmets should be mandatory because if you also have comparable amount of spinal injuries then you could argue that it should be law to wear back braces like those DH mountain bikers wear, even on the road! As a consequence, it is understandable why some people think helmets are an arbitrary requirement. But those studies also need to take into account in what environment these injuries take place. E.g. in Amsterdam and most European countries no one wears helmets but bicycles and cars move much slower and because of their infrastructure they do not have to meddle with cars as much. It's a different story in places like USA and Australia where there is little or no separation between bicycles and cars, and cars move very fast. Anyway I always wear a helmet. 

Aiming to build a shaft driven bicycle for efficiency is the wrong direction. Efficiency improvements of shaft over chain driven in bicycle is negligible. Not to mention, shaft driven is overshadowed by an (un)established market regarding gearing on bicycle. Advantages of shaft driven: 

Microshift is a brand. They are Taiwan base. Most of the twist shifter operates in similar manner as you described. They are for trimming as Batman said. But in fact it is made from the same machine and parts to keep the cost down. It is all about how to set up the front derailleur in your system, and find a spot for each appropriate gearing. i.e. avoid chain rubbing on the front derailleur There is one thing that I like about twist shifter, is that when you shift up, you can go slightly higher than where it suppose to be on the front chainring. This helps your chain to shift up easier and faster. 

So to sum up, the average wind speed does not have enough drag (force) to null the speed of you and your bicycle, which is constantly 'replenished' by your pedaling. 

Completely remove the bicycle quill Hang the bike up-side down Take out the wedge. If the wedge is stuck, try inserting the quill bolt alone (no quill, just bolt). Take care not to push the wedge further in. Try to thread in the wedge, and remove the wedge when there is enough grip. If wedge is truly stuck, remove the front wheel from the fork. The fork should have a hole so that you can push the wedge from below (with rod/hammer) Re-assemble the quill and wedge with the bolt correctly. Make sure you know how to do this, it should be straight-forward. 

I've bought these bars second hand and would like to clean them out before I use them. Right now they're full of dust, dirt, spiders, etc. Will it do any damage to run water through them? I'll, of course, let them drain and dry before putting them to use. 

I've ordered some second-hand handlebars from one seller on eBay, and brake levers from a different seller. Both claim to be 22.2mm diameter but the clip on the levers (as photographed) will be a very tight fit if it will fit at all. Am I right in thinking that the clip as photographed doesn't come apart into any other pieces? The levers do say 22.2, I can't find any markings on the bars. Am I right in thinking that 22.2mm bars and 22.2mm levers go together? 

I'm thinking of doing so for the non-corrosive properties of titanium. Weight isn't an issue. The thing I'm not sure of is the hardness of the titanium vs steel. 

I have some energy gel sachets that are a few months out of date. Do they contain anything that might be dangerous after their best-before date? 

The bike is a 1983 Dawes Galaxy and upon trying the raise the saddle this morning, I found this stubby little thing. 

Does a bike with an alloy seat post and a carbon frame need a seat post clamp with two bolts? Most clamps these days seem to be either quick release or single bolt. Is that safe to use with my set up? I have read a little around the subject and not found any definitive answer.
