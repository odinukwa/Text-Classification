If the GPS is mostly off (i.e. you're only rarely using your GPS app), I think you will get ~2 days of battery life. To get that much battery life, you'd need to do these things: 

For me, the cons kill quilts - I like zipping into my mummy bag and not having to worry about lying perfectly still :) I think in summer trips, they are a pretty awesome idea... I always end up half out of my mummy bag anyways, no matter how light it is, so why not? 

So even with all that, you're looking at 2 days. What can you do beyond that? I think the simplest solution to get you the recharge you'd need is to buy an iPhone battery case - usually this is just an external Li-ion battery that plugs into your iPhone. These are pretty common, fairly light, and generally easy to use. They also have the advantage of often combining in a waterproof case (so you can take pictures even if it is raining). The limitation might be that it doesn't actually get you enough charges for what you want to do (a bazillion pictures are a lot!) I agree that hand-cranks and solar chargers are not nearly reliable enough. So the only other solution that I might consider is something that eats AA Li-ion disposable batteries (or if you feel environmentally friendly, the best AA rechargeables you can find) and spits out power via USB. Tekkeon makes a couple products that might be the right kind of thing (I've used one before that worked perfectly)... You might try this one. Li-ion AAs are very light, although expensive, and each set of 2 will charge your iPhone 1-2 times (depends on which AA charger you get and which iPhone you have... might be best to test this before you leave!). 

This clearly doesn't apply to PLBs. A report that distinguishes PLBs from other EPIRBs is a January 2014 report by ICOA which says 

Note that many of the above incidents measured above relate to automatically-activated beacons carried on boats, rather than PLBs, so it may be invalid to suggest that the PLB false-activation rate is the same as for EPIRBs in general. For example, the last document above says that 

Higher-end compasses have a north arrow that can be rotated relative to the baseplate - usually with a screw adjuster somewhere around the edge. The grid lines on the baseplate remain in a fixed position, so that the arrow can point to magnetic north when the lines point to grid north. On your picture, the thin red line at about 183° shows that your compass is adjusted for 3° East declination (reading the yellow scale). It's a shame you only have two grid lines (at the far left and right of the window) for lining up with your map. Use the yellow scale (marked "West Declination" and "East Declination") to set the declination to match your region and map projection. 

I've been surprised by how durable tent floors are. I've never used footprints, and I have a silnylon-floored tent (i.e. not very durable material) that has lasted hundreds of nights and still doesn't have any holes or thin spots. So really, I would call it wasted money and weight in your pack to carry a footprint. If you forsee using the tent in "fast pack" configuration, i.e. no tent body, then consider getting the footprint just for that. 

Warning This is pure conjecture! Test this information with your gear in a safe place before using! That being said, the basic warmth of a sleeping bag is determined by the amount of loft the fill provides. Quality of fill has a huge impact on how much loft is necessary to provide a given warmth, along with construction (i.e. baffles vs sewn through, hood quality, down distribution). Putting all that aside, a good 20F down bag will have 4-5" of loft. So theoretically one inside the other would have 8-10". Again, theoretically that would give you ~ -10F (or perhaps even lower!). This is assuming you don't have any down compression happening when you stuff one inside the other (i.e. you choose two bags with girths such that they don't compress each other). Since that's not likely possible, I would imagine real world performance would be quite a bit lower (maybe -5F?), and I would certainly want to test it with backups available before striking out into the wild! 

Cave photographers have to deal with a similar problem, where thin steam that's normally invisible can be seen in photographs taken with flash. Steam is composed of fairly spherical droplets of water. These act in a similar way to road studs of the "cat's-eye" type - they reflect light directly back to its source. The solution is to move the light off-axis, so the reflection is no longer aimed at your camera (eye). So take your head-torch off, and hold or attach it away from your line of sight. Attaching it to your belt is ideal, if you want to illuminate the ground - you now have less distance between the light and the target (though if you get it too low, you'll find that every rock casts a huge shadow, hiding your route). This is the same principle as front fog lights on motor vehicles, which are low-mounted for the same reasons. 

I don't think you need to bypass them at all. You didn't say what time of year you'd be going, but in the later summer/fall, they are not nearly that deep. Also, at any time of year you could easily carry your pack(s) across, then go back and piggy-back your son with a 2nd trip. The first trip would also give you a feel for how rough the crossing would be. In June 2015 I did the 100 Mile Wilderness (along with the whole AT south bound). Even at that time, with the rivers running hard and sometimes waist deep, it would be quite reasonable to cross in the manner I described. 

I was hoping someone else would offer a more scientific answer, but here's my take on it. You shouldn't need almost any ventilation around the top edge of your wind screen... A few small gaps, or even just a handful of punched holes above the level of your stove should be enough. At the base of your windscreen though, you need a lot of holes to draw air in with. I'm sorry I can't provide specifics, but if you have a windscreen that is failing now, start by adding a few holes at the bottom and retest. Then add a few around the middle/top (~1" above the bottom edge of your pot). Retest until satisfied :) 

The declination is just telling you the angle between (Grid or True) North and (Magnetic) North, so you just need to be consistent with the two knowns to get the angle you need between your bearing and Magnetic North. In a high-latitude location like Iceland, the declination may differ significantly from sheet to sheet - possibly even within a sheet, in which case you'll likely be given the value at each corner, and you should interpolate accordingly. 

You can make a simple diagram of the transmitted and reflected light to convince yourself that this works (sorry, it's beyond my ASCII-art capabilities right now!). A CD, DVD or similar medium can be used as a makeshift signal mirror, and conveniently has a hole in the right place. 

You need to know whether the magnetic declination you have was measured from Grid North or from True North. 

Imagine for a minute that the Earth is perfectly spherical, that sunlight arrives "from infinity", and that any given spot is either lit or unlit. Then, at any given time, exactly half the surface is in "daytime" and the other half in "night-time". The line separating the two is a Great Circle - a circle with the same centre and radius as the solid sphere. It should be clear that any other Great Circle on this ideal Earth must intersect this penumbral line and be divided exactly into two equal parts of light and dark. Now consider the path that any given place on the sphere travels as it rotates. It will move around a line of latitude (i.e. always eastwards). This path forms a circle parallel to the Equator. There is a line of latitude that is a Great Circle, and that is the Equator itself. So we can deduce that a point on the Equator, in ideal conditions, will spend exactly half the day on the light side and half the day on the dark side of the Earth (except for the case we ruled out where the Sun is exactly over one of the poles).
