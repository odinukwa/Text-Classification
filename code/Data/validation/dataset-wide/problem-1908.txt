It's unfortunate but it's pretty common in the US for HR to instruct people not to give references. That way, the company isn't at risk of a lawsuit if the reference isn't strong enough or says something negative. Lots of large companies have blanket policies of not giving references. There really isn't anything you can do other than asking someone else to be your reference. If it looks odd not to offer a reference from this employer-- for example if you're providing a reference from someone you worked for while going to school rather than someone from your first long-term professional job-- you can always explain that the company has a blanket policy against references. That's common enough that it shouldn't e an issue. 

Of course, that sort of thing is unlikely to feel particularly emotionally fulfilling when you're really upset that the employer didn't bother to reply when they decided to go in a different direction. Realistically, you're better served complaining to friends or family about how wrenching the application process can be than to send an email that admonishes a potential employer. 

If you want your first job out of school to be with a company in one of these sectors, it wouldn't hurt and it could help. If I'm recruiting someone for a position in a games company, all things being equal, I'm going to prefer a candidate with the extra coursework in graphics than someone with a more general degree. On the other hand, candidates are rarely equal and I certainly wouldn't hesitate to hire the candidate with the general degree if they were the better candidate. If you are applying for a job that isn't in one of these specific areas, it's unlikely to matter either way. Looking down the road, these specializations get less and less beneficial the further you are from school. Once you've got a couple of years of practical experience, companies are going to be far more concerned with what you have experience with than what you have coursework in. 

Yes, it's quite common for job descriptions to contain a list of requirements that no one actually fulfills and for employers to hire applicants that match on some subset of the requirements. This is particularly for "jack-of-all-trades" type IT folks. The company may want someone that has experience administering three types of databases, a couple different application servers, installing and managing a few different operating systems, and that can write code in a few different languages. That doesn't mean that they actually expect that someone will have all those skills when they apply (though, if they get lucky, that's a bonus). They generally know that the applicants they get are going to be strong in some skills, weak in others, and will need to learn the others. From the employer's perspective, it's often hard to write a job description that tells the applicant the actual breadth of the position that doesn't devolve into a nearly impossible list of requirements. A small company looking for a jack-of-all-trades, for example, that can handle development and administration tasks wants to reach out to developers, DBAs, and systems administrators that might be interested in branching out to other areas so they don't want to make any one skill set more important than the others. But when you add all the skill sets of all those roles, you get a job description that is looking for a magical unicorn that doesn't really exist. 

This basically means that you won't do any work for a client of the company that you worked for for at least a year after leaving the company. From the staffing firm's standpoint, what they are trying to prevent is the contractor (you) and the client (whoever you end up actually doing work for) deciding that they can contract directly and cut out the staffing firm from their cut. The staffing firm expends time and effort finding openings, finding contractors, managing relationships, etc. that they make up over time by taking a cut from the hourly wage. If the client and the contractor decide to bypass the staffing firm, that destroys the economics of the staffing firm and turns them into a very poorly paid headhunter. 

You're not going to realistically open yourself up to a lawsuit by translating it yourself. But a third-party translation will hold more weight with a potential employer. American employers aren't going to care much about a letter of recommendation in the first place. They are going to be particularly likely to discount one from a foreign country where they aren't going to be aware of what the letter implies-- the AZ is always going to be positive. A German employer can probably read between the lines to infer the difference between "did just enough to remain employed" and "best employee we've ever had". An American employer is going to have a very hard time doing that unless they happen to have a background in German employment norms. But an applicant-provided translation of such a document is going to be all but worthless because it would be far, far too easy for an applicant to shade the meaning of the terms. Knowing that the document has to be positive, it's easy for an applicant to pick slightly more emphatic words to eliminate whatever nuance was present in the original. A third-party official translation at least eliminates the last of these issues. Given that it is very unlikely that the AZ will be of any real use to you in your American job hunt, I probably wouldn't bother to have it translated at all. If it comes up in an interview (reference checks are generally one of the last steps), you can certainly offer to get the AZ translated. But I would doubt that many potential employers would take you up on that. 

Is it acceptable? Sure. Is it the right approach? I'm hard-pressed to see why it would be. If you want to express some appreciation to a particular employee, it would seem to be far more meaningful if that appreciation came directly from you rather than hoping that someone that is coming in to replace you (presumably knowing neither you nor this employee) expresses appreciation on your behalf. 

Making the request shouldn't create a bad impression-- managers that deal with employees that have family out of the country are generally accustomed to employees taking longer, less frequent vacations. As with any request, however, you need to be prepared to compromise or even have your request turned down. And you'll want to think through the concerns your manager and the company are likely to have. If you are getting three weeks of vacation as a new graduate in the United States, for example, it is very likely that this is a combination of vacation time, sick leave, and other forms of paid time-off. If that's the case, your plans would require going two weeks negative in your accrued time off at the beginning of the year which would basically prevent you from taking a sick day for the first year of your employment. It's pretty unlikely that anyone can guarantee that you won't get sick for a year. That may make your manager concerned about when you would be able to get back to a 0 balance and whether that will involve you coming in to work when you're sick and infecting everyone else in the group. The company may also have policies that prevent you from going too far into the negative on your accrued vacation. They may also have policies about how long a single vacation can be (and three weeks would likely be pushing the envelope). The company may be willing to let you go a day or two negative. But going two weeks negative may create issues for HR. If someone leaves the company with a huge negative balance, that almost certainly creates headaches for the company which is why they generally try to avoid the situation. Is there something about this year that is particularly special? If there is a special reason that you want to be home this year, it may be easier for the company to deal with you having a one-time negative vacation balance. If your intention is to take a long vacation home every year, meaning that you would end up spending the first 8 months of every year getting back to a 0 balance, that is likely to be much more problematic. Companies are really wary of people that are continuously at a negative balance with no expectation that they'll ever be accruing their vacation time before they use it. Depending on the type of job, there may also be political considerations. If, for example, your group is responsible for supporting a production process, it's likely that someone has to be working during the holidays to take care of issues as they come up. It so, it would be common for things like seniority to come into play where the more senior members of the group get the first choice of holidays and the newer employees have to work the days nobody else wants like Christmas or New Year's Day. There may also be projects that require work over the holiday period (the end of the year can be a popular time to install new software if that is a relatively slow period for the company. Or Christmas may be a key period for the company and they may want to minimize the time off people take in the lead-up to that holiday. 

You're already between 2 and 3 months, presumably, into a 6 month contract so quitting early is almost certainly a bad idea. The world tends to be rather small and the chances that you'll burn a bridge that you'd like to use in a few years is rather high. Plus, it sounds like quitting would be problematic for you financially which makes it even less attractive. If you are doing short-term contract work, the problem tends to be how to compress, say, 10 6-month contracts into a paragraph to show what you did for the past 5 years. You can talk about the business problems you solved without needing to be specific about which technologies were used on which contracts. Realistically, though, it seems likely that a few months of heavy-duty Excel macro development would be a good skill for a Sharepoint developer to have given how most people use Sharepoint. The only reason I would consider talking with your manager is if the company has told you that it intends to renew your contract at the end of the 6-month period. If that's the case, it may be helpful to meet with your manager and explain that you're perfectly happy to fulfill the contract doing Excel macro development but that you aren't going to be interested in renewing unless there is more Sharepoint work to do. And you may want to suggest to your manager that they may want to change the job description if and when they look for a new developer because they are likely to be better served by someone that has more Excel macro experience that can pick up Sharepoint than the reverse. 

It depends on how you are listing the technologies and whether the technologies you are no longer interested in have some relationship to technologies that you are interested in. Frequently, technologies that you have used in the past have some sort of relationship to technologies that you want to use today that you can use to demonstrate a deeper level of experience. For example, imagine that you spent 5 years doing C++ development before moving on to Java development for the past 3 years and that you are only interested in doing Java development today. It would still be very much in your interest to list your experience with C++ because that lets you position yourself as having 8 years of experience doing object oriented development with the last 3 in the particular language you are interested in. That is going to be much more interesting to an interviewer than someone with just 3 years of Java development. Older technologies are often also useful to help you check off some of the technologies that companies list as "nice to have" by showing that you've done something similar. If a company is looking for a Java developer and lists Perl as a "nice to have", it can be helpful to be able to point to a bit of Python development that you've done and talk about the similarities between the two languages. Even if you are not interested in writing Python any longer, your experience can be leveraged to discuss your ability to write Perl in the future. It will also depend on where and how you are listing the technologies. If you have a section on your resume where you list the languages you're familiar with, your years of experience, your level of expertise, etc. it's much more likely that you want to omit technologies that you don't want to be quizzed on. If you are talking about the portion of your resume where you list the jobs you've held, what you did in each position, what technologies you used, etc. it would be very odd to omit the major technologies that you used even if you are no longer interested in those technologies. Unless the position is so old that you remove it entirely, you'll want to talk about the technologies that you used. If you're the hypothetical C++ to Java developer I was discussing earlier, it would make sense to discuss your use of C++ when describing your previous job but it might make sense to omit C++ from the section of your resume that focuses on skills and to just emphasize the technologies you do want to use. Even in the skills section, though, you may want to leverage some of those old technologies by, for example, explicitly listing 8 years of experience with object-oriented development. 

How likely are you to actually get called? There is a pretty wide range of organizations out there. In some, the on call person will undoubtedly get called a couple times per week for something. In others, things run smoothly enough that calls happen maybe once a quarter. What are the rules for being on call? If the expectation is that the on call person can't go see a movie or be more than a certain distance from their laptop, that's a pretty serious imposition. If the expectation is that you can live your life and that they'll just continue down the list until they find someone that can fix the issue, that's a different level of imposition. Does the employer's proposal include a policy on how to handle on-call time as a starting point? How flexible is the employer planning on being if you're called at 2am to fix an issue-- does that mean that you don't have to come in the next day until noon (or that you can leave at noon)? Or are they expecting these to be purely additional hours? Is this flexibility something that appeals to you? Or are you solely interested in negotiating additional pay? It's not unreasonable to go to your employer and say "You're asking me to work X additional hours per week and disrupting Y hours of my free time, I'm going to need some additional consideration" where X and Y are based on the probability of getting called, the amount of time that is likely to be spent addressing the issue, and the rules around being on call. Generally, it will be easier for the employer to come up with some sort of "comp time" policy that can be applied to everyone that is on call (i.e. if you spend an hour fixing something that broke at night everyone is happy if you come in 2 hours late or leave 2 hours early the next day). It is, of course, possible that the employer would be willing to negotiate additional pay but that would generally set a bad precedent for them since the other developers would likely want a similar benefit. If you've been there a few months, perhaps you could ask for a review at the 6 month mark which combines your performance and your additional responsibilities (being on call) where you could negotiate a raise. That lets the employer avoid setting a precedent of paying additional for being on call while allowing you to get some extra compensation.
