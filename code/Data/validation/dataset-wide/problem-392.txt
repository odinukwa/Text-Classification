Your teleportation method works by transmitting the full quantum state of a person through a communications channel and applying it to a different set of atoms. The no cloning theorem guarantees that when your quantum state is transferred the state of the original atoms is destroyed and can be transmitted to exactly one other place. Scientifically minded materialists will have no problem using the machine because they believe everything that is 'them' is encoded in their quantum state, and therefore their consciousness really is transferred at the moment of disintegration. On the other hand spiritualists will feel that this can't account for the human soul, and that you are annihilated in the process. Perhaps they'll even feel that people who've used the machine are non-human zombies. The no cloning theorem also saves you from the problems of 'what if someone uses the machine to make an army of themselves' and 'what if an unscrupulous teleporter operator also sends an extra copy of me to be enslaved in his off-world uranium mines'. 

If we're allowing time dilation, perhaps we could just send people straight into sagittarius A* towards the end of their life, so that from the point of view of the rest of the galaxy they never die (Lets ignore what happens in their own frame of reference). Then we can get on with the task of converting the galaxies mass into people. There is about $10^{41}$kg of normal matter in the galaxy (I'm assuming you can't turn dark matter into people), so I think $10^{39}$ people might be an absolute upper limit, giving us ~30kg of energy per person for our extensive breeding and transport program. 

It was something that was brought up, but it was fairly quickly debunked. The concern was not about a chemical reaction (the atmosphere is pretty chemically inert as its two main constituents don't tend to react with each other). Rather they were worried that a nuclear chain reaction of either nitrogen-nitrogen fusion or nitrogen-hydrogen fusion (with the hydrogen being supplied by boiling the oceans and disassociating the water). Here's a contemporary paper about it, showing that it won't happen: $URL$ Roughly speaking, they show that at any temperature the heat radiated away is greater than the heat added by nitrogen-nitrogen fusion reactions, given the density of nitrogen in the atmosphere and assuming that any physical collision of sufficient energy results in fusion (because they did not know the true reaction cross section). This means that energy is always lost so the reaction cannot be self sustaining. They also showed that N-H physical collisions are less likely and that other processes they haven't accounted for take more energy out, so overall they show that it doesn't happen even taking generous assumptions in favour of it happening. So I'm afraid the answer is you can't under the real laws of physics with an earth like atmospheric composition. If you can put large quantities of something flammable or fusible/fissile into the atmosphere then it becomes much easier, obviously. If we're not talking about the real world and you want to change the laws of physics in a way that isn't too noticeable, then perhaps something like increasing the size of atomic nuclei so fusion interactions become more likely would make the situation the scientists feared possible (ignoring the knock on effects in stars etc). 

China's one-child policy didn't result in a different demographic development than a country like Thailand without such a policy. As a result it wouldn't be the policy to focus on. Current trends mean that many developed countries achieve a children/woman ratio substantially lower than 2. That means over the long-term the population would shrink. A population engineer would therefore do whatever they can to repeat to develop other countries as well. Reducing childhood deaths is especially important. Which trends could still produce long-term population growth? Growing religions such as the Mormons demand it's adherents to have many children. Taking actions to deconvert those groups and let them shrink instead of grow over time could be another area for policies. 

The point in time when the mirror was created would be a unique identifier. Using it would fit with believing in the medieval concept of astrology. 

If all words in the language match 1-to-1 to English words, it's basically simply a code for English. Pitjantjatjara for example doesn't have a word that means what the English word means. Even European languages differ in the contexts the have. If I want to translate the German word Polish offers me one choice with according to Leo. On the other hand English offers me 8 choices: , , , , , and . English allows to make much more distinctions then Polish when talking about probabilities. On the other hand the English languages uses words like or in lot's of different ways. To be essentially serves the purpose of four terms of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage location, existence, specification and possession. Letting 4 of the 56 most important concepts of a language be represented by the same word seems very wasteful and yet English works fine. This means that your language can also reuse words if you don't have enough words. Depending on the purpose of your language you don't have to add all the word at the start. When you find that you currently can't talk about something that would be important you can just add new words. 

Suppose I'm a rich, well-connected psychological scientist with a lot of spare time, and I'm sick of WEIRD science. 

You don't know this, but in the program that is your consciousness there are break points. I.e., points in which the program stops, and you have a chance to reflect on it and perhaps change it. The way this works is that you suddenly have an out-of-body experience, in which you realize that time has stopped and you have an ability to change certain things about yourself (see details below). You know that once you 'resume' yourself you will forget that this ever happened, and you don't remember it ever happening before although you are aware it's possible that it had. What you can do: 

If we knew, we wouldn't need spells The thing about what we do to animals, is that we don't really know how they feel about it. Many people honestly say that they don't believe animals can suffer or feel pain, and that's why it's all justified. Others enjoy the benefit of the doubt. If we could speak to animals, we could know for sure how they feel and decide accordingly. A moving speech from a cow would probably make many people go vegan (others would argue that these animals wouldn't even be born if it wasn't for us needing them for food). If they turn out to be feeling-less, we would use them even more. So the real question is, what would they say. What would they say? I believe what they would say is exactly what they say now, in actions and demeanor. When my dog says "woof" I know what she means. It's not complex ideas, mostly emotions and basic needs. I doubt an animal would evolve the complex skills of symbolic thinking without being able to use it. I also highly doubt that they can express emotions without feeling them, as some think (I doubt that's even logically possible) So lab animals would probably say "I'm scared", "I'm in pain", "I don't like the person in the white coat" etc. Nothing we couldn't have guessed already. To conclude 

You don't need to win the presidency to have political impact. Trying to change the voting system on the Federal level is a relatively hard problem because it requires you to convince a lot of different people. if you wanted to fight the two party system it makes much more sense to focus on a more local level. Getting a single US state to switch to Party List Proportional Representation for it's state election would be much easier than to try to get the whole US to change. 

A robot might be able to cut my hair as well as a human but hit won't give me the same experience has a hair dresses that talks to me while it makes my hair. The same goes for low-wage workers like baby sitters that provide a service that inherently needs a human. We might also see a comeback of buttlers and similar human services if the price is low enough. 

Let's start by understanding where the idea that demon's can be controlled by knowing their name comes from. Other answers highlite that many cultures throughout history separate considered a name to have power. That raises the question about the experience that make people believe that names have power. From a modern perspective rituals that are about summoning demons are similar to what's done in Family Systems Therapy and Systemic Therapy. Part of Systemic Therapy is it to address parts with their name. A name binds a concept in a way that makes it easier to address the concept in a systemic constellations. The Focusing framework of Eugine Gendlin with has 80 scientific papers in it's favor also has finding a name (a handle) as an essential part to talk to an internal part. There are mental processes that happen when a mental concept is given a handle. Processes that make it easier to influence those concepts. Many other psychological interventions use finding names as part of their process. Historically a daemon is usually an entity that's tasked that's brought to consciousness and then get's tasked with doing something in the background. That's the point of most magick rituals summoning daemons. That usage of the word daemon is strong enough that your computer runs daemons in the background. If you want to shut down daemons in your computer than you need the name of the daemon to do so. In Linux of you know it's name is you can simply write on the command line and the daemon is killed. Depending on how daemons work in your world they could work similar to computer programs with can get a physical form when summoned into this world. 

They are not really fire-proof Much like ruining a dishwasher with water, you can burn a dragon with fire - if you direct it to a weak spot. There's no reason why the outer belly of the dragon should be fire proof. Also, when it breathes fire, the fire doesn't stay close too long. It's most likely created outside the body. Fire is much more dangerous when someone pushes it at you. 

Fake knows doesn't hold forever, but since time is of the essence it could help. It also won't work in high profile cases where a team of well trusted hindsighters could verify exactly what happened, but it should at least give any culprit some hope of getting away with stuff given a good lawyer. 

Edit: I added the tag to encourage out-of-the-box answers. I would accept some craziness for better results, although simplicity is preferred. (There isn't an actual study!) 

Find someone with hindsight and a sketchy character Give them money Have them falsely confirm your alibi and blame the crime on someone else + discredit whoever is condemning you (including if it's the judge his/her self!) Maybe throw in some conspiracy theories for the hell of it Stall the trial, say "we just can't know for sure what happened! So many alternative facts!" Walk away happy as a clam 

By the courtesy of the other dead I don't know if all cultures believe in souls ascending to heaven, so relying on your enemies in battle may not be wise. However, since not all your dead are trapped (those who are reachable can be helped), it could be a matter of courtesy in those cultures to not ascend the minute you are free, but have a look around, especially in times of war, for fellow souls which are trapped and free them before you go. Army units in particular can have it planned ahead that everyone who dies makes sure all the others are alive or descended. 

If you mean kinetic energy, adding kinetic energy to a particular part of the body usually relaxes it. Blood flow frequently increases. Increased blood flow means that the immune system can sometimes deal differently with the related tissue. Cancer get's today already treated by focusing energy through radiction on specific parts. If the magic can identify successfully which cells are cancerous it can also kill those cells. 

Currently states like the US and Canada are willing to give up sovereignty and subject themselves to courts that precide over Investor-State-Dispute-Settlements (ISDS). The German supreme court did rule that agreeing to the Lisbon treaty means giving up sovereignty and therefore needed a change in the German constiution. It's not guranteed that the trend of putting more power into bigger institutions continues. In state where there's the rule of law the state can gradually give more and more of it's sovereinity to more global instiutions. 

The government of the country in which the company operate can simply pass laws to regulate the company and the pricing of the service. Even if the company would set it self up in some third world country which they can controls wars might be fought over the technology. 

If you would have a political tests on the powers of the president it might have a question like: Constiutionally declaring war is the prerogative of congress but in practice US presidents do have the power to start war. A person creating the test could decide on what happens to be the right answer based on their own political beliefs. That means they can filter who's allowed to vote based on the political beliefs of the person. You can't have a test without a person writting the test. Thinking of the test being unbaised is like thinking of Supreme Court Justices being unbaised. The human element is always present and can't be simply removed. 

There are many reports of tribes considering photography to be dangerous because it supposedly steals a persons soul. You can make a decent argument that those tribes consider photography to be magical. Even among people born in the West you find many people who consider Derren Brown to have real magic powers and aren't willing to believe that he's just using a bunch of tricks.
