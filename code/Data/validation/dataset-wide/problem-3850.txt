Abstract and concrete categories: The joy of cats by Jiri Adamek, Horst Herrlich and George Strecker, is a nice book for learning category theory. It went out of print, so the authors made it available online for free. 

As to what cohomology actually measures, I think a general theme is "the failure of locally trivial things to be globally trivial", or perhaps "the failure of local solutions to glue together to form a global solution". In the de Rham cohomology of a smooth manifold, any closed form ω is "locally trivial" in that you can cover the manifold by contractible charts, over each of which a solution to dα=ω exists by the Poincaré lemma. The cohomology class [ω] measures the failure of existence of a global solution of this equation. Similar remarks can be made about simplicial, singular, and (especially) Čech cohomology. 

The condition $r>\sqrt 2$ is also sufficient. The random variables $(M_n)_{n\geq1}$ are iid (in fact, we need that they are identically distributed), due to the independence of the increments and the translation invariance of Brownian motion. We shall use the first Borel-Cantelli lemma to prove that for $r>\sqrt 2$, $$ \mathbb{P}[M_n\geq r\sqrt{\log n}\text{ infinitely often}]=0. $$ To this end, it is sufficient to prove that $$ \sum_n \mathbb{P}[M_n\geq r\sqrt{\log n}]<\infty. $$ Indeed, $$ \mathbb{P}[M_n\geq r\sqrt{\log n}]=\mathbb{P}[M_1\geq r\sqrt{\log n}]\leq 2\mathbb{P}[U_1\geq r\sqrt{\log n}], $$ where $U_t=\max\{B_s:s\in[0,t]\}$ is the running maximum (the inequality above holds since $M_1$ is the largest between $U_1$ and $-L_1$, and $U_t$ and $-L_t$ have the same distribution, where $L_t$ is the running minimum). By the reflection principle, $$ \mathbb{P}[U_1\geq r\sqrt{\log n}]=2\mathbb{P}[B_1\geq r\sqrt{\log n}] =2(1-\Phi(r\sqrt{\log n})), $$ and the series converges for $r>\sqrt 2$. Notice that since $\mathbb{P}[M_1\geq r\sqrt{\log n}]\geq\mathbb{P}[U_1\geq r\sqrt{\log n}]$ and since $(M_n)_{n\geq1}$ are independent, a similar argument and the second Borel-Cantelli lemma (as in the answer of @Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen) provide the necessity of the condition. 

I eventually found the answer to my question. The answer is no: take $\nu$ the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. Let $\hat{\nu}_n$ be the empirical distribution obtained from $n$ samples of $\nu$. Let $\Gamma$ be the set of all discrete signed measures. It is a convex subset of the set of all signed measures. For $x \in \Gamma$, $I(x) = KL(x,\nu) = +\infty$ so $\inf_{x \in \Gamma}{I(x)} = +\infty$ and $$e^{-n \inf_{x\in \Gamma}{I(x)}} = 0$$ Yet $$\mathbb{P}\left(\hat{\nu}_n \in \Gamma\right) = 1$$ since the empirical distribution is of course discrete. (Note that it is possible to find a topology making the space considered a Polish one, see Dembo and Zeitouni for example.) So topological arguments are needed, at least in the infinite dimensional setting. Still wondering if the result holds in finite dimension though (it does hold in dimension $1$). 

if $\int_x^1\frac{G(y)}{y}\,dy=\infty$, then $\mathbb{P}[\tau_0=\infty]=1$, if $\int_x^1\frac{G(y)}{y}\,dy<\infty$, then $\mathbb{P}[\tau_0=\infty]=1$ if and only if $\int_0^1 (\varphi(x)-\varphi(0))m(x)\,dx=\infty$, 

As usual this kind of questions can be answered using the Feller test for explosion (see for instance Karatzas, Shreve). Before doing the computations, let me notice that $f\equiv0$ is the Bessel process, while $f\equiv\epsilon$ is the example given. Therefore, the strength of the order of zero of $f$ should be the main parameter. The stronger the zero, the closer to Bessel is the process $Y$; the weaker, the closer to the $\epsilon$ case. In other words, conditions on $f(y)/y$ should not be sufficient (and indeed they aren't, see below). Now the computations. Let $$ G(x) = \operatorname{e}^{-\int_x^1\frac{f(z)}{z}\,dz}, $$ then the scale function $\varphi$ and the speed measure $m$ for $Y$ are given by $$ \varphi(x)=-\int_x^1\frac{G(y)}{y}\,dy, \qquad m(x)=\frac{x}{G(x)}. $$ The Feller test yields, 

A minimax theorem is a theorem which states that under certain conditions on $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and $f$: $$ \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}}{\sup_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{f(x,y)}} = \sup_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}}{f(x,y)}}$$ All minimax theorems rely strongly on convexity: the sets $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are usually required to be convex subsets of vector spaces, and $f$ to be convex-concave. My question is: of course one cannot expect much without some convexity, but is it possible to get rid of the convexity of the domain in any way? For example, consider the simplest minimax problem: $\mathcal{X}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathcal{Y}$ a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x,y) = \langle x,y \rangle$ is the usual scalar product. Are there any minimax results in this setting (with of course additional assumptions on $\mathcal{X}$ or $\mathcal{Y}$, but $\mathcal{X}$ should not be assumed to be convex) ? 

I like to talk about planarity of graphs, because it's easy to introduce, easy to draw on a napkin, and on the "application" side of things you can mention computer chip design, transportation networks, and other things. The nonplanarity of $K_{3,3}$ can be introduced via the "three utilities" puzzle: you have three houses and you want to connect each one to each of three utilities (water, hydro, gas) -- can you do it without having the lines cross? Similarly the nonplanarity of $K_5$ can be posed as a puzzle, and Kuratowski's theorem basically asserts that these two examples give the only obstructions to planarity: a graph is planar if and only if it contains no subgraph homeomorphic to $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$. Going further, you can talk about embedding graphs on a torus (i.e. in a game of Asteroids), for which you can draw examples of embeddings of $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$, and say that there's an analogy of Kuratowski's theorem (by corollary to the Robertson-Seymour theorem): there is a finite list of "forbidden graphs" which are the only obstruction to a graph being embeddable on the torus, in the sense that any nonembeddable graph contains one of those forbidden graphs as a minor. 

The inequality does not hold. Take $a,\varphi$ smooth, periodic, then integrations by parts yield $$ 0 = \int_\mathbb{T}(a\varphi^2)_{xx} = \int_\mathbb{T}(a_{xx}\varphi^2+a(\varphi^2)_{xx}+2a_x(\varphi^2)_x) = 2\int_\mathbb{T}a_{xx}\varphi - 2\int_\mathbb{T}a(\varphi^2)_{xx} = 2\Bigl(\int_\mathbb{T}a_{xx}\varphi^2-\int_\mathbb{T}a\varphi_x^2\Bigr) - 2\int_\mathbb{T}a(\varphi_x^2+2\varphi\varphi_{xx}) $$ that is $$ \int_\mathbb{T}a\varphi_x^2 - \int_\mathbb{T}a_{xx}\varphi^2 = -\int_\mathbb{T}a(\varphi_x^2+2\varphi\varphi_{xx}) $$ and there is no reason the right-hand side should be positive. Take for instance $\varphi=\cos x$ and $a=1+b$ with $b$ non-zero (and big) only where $\varphi_x^2+2\varphi\varphi_{xx}=\sin^2x-2\cos^2x$ is positive. [update] The inequality does not hold even in its general version. Say you want to prove that $\int a (\varphi_x)^2\geq\lambda\int a_{xx}\varphi^2$, then by integration by parts $\int a_{xx}\varphi^2=\int a(\varphi^2)_{xx}$ and the supposed inequality reads $\int a((\varphi_x)^2-\lambda(\varphi^2)_{xx})\geq0$. By localization (with a smooth cut-off function), it is sufficient to find a $\varphi$ (not necessarily periodic, by the same localization argument) such that $(\varphi_x)^2-\lambda(\varphi^2)_{xx}<0$ on an open set. This is easy, take $\varphi(x)=e^{a e^{bx}}$ and choose $a,b$ suitably. 

If the action of $G$ on $X$ is continuous (i.e. the multiplication map $X\times G\to X$ is continuous) then the resulting topology is $\tau$: Let $\tilde X$ denote $(X\times G)/\sim$, and let $\phi:X\to \tilde X:x\mapsto[x,e]$ be the identification you mentioned (with the factors $X,G$ reversed for convenience). Then $\phi$ is clearly continuous. Let $\psi:\tilde X\to X$ be the inverse of $\phi$, i.e. $\psi([x,g]) = xg$. For an open subset $U$ of $X$, $\psi^{-1}(U) = \{(x,g):xg\in U\}$. Pulling this back to $X\times G$ via the projection $X\times G\to\tilde X$ gives exactly the preimage of $U$ under the multiplication map $X\times G\to G$, which is open, and so $\psi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\tilde X$. So $\phi$ is a homeomorphism. 

This question deals with approximating a convex body (a compact convex set of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with non-empty interior) by convex polytopes. For a given $\delta$, let $n_\delta$ be the number of faces needed to approximate any convex body by a contained convex polytope with at most $n_\delta$ faces and Hausdorff distance at most $\delta$. I'm interested in non-asymptotic upper-bounds on this number $n_\delta$ of faces. In the following survey: $URL$ the author gives in (6) a non asymptotic upper bound, on the number of vertices $n_{\delta,v}$ needed to approximate a convex body by a polytope with Hausdorff distance at most $\delta$: $$\delta \leq \frac{C}{n_{\delta,v}^{\frac{2}{d-1}}} $$ He then states "Certainly the same estimates hold for" approximation by polytopes contained in/containing the convex body, and also replacing vertices by faces. So when taking "faces" and "contained in", this is exactly the result I want. Unfortunately, there is no clear reference given to such results. Since this problem is really far from my field, I don't have access to many sources through my department's subscriptions to scientific journals and through my libray. If I knew a precise reference, it would be no problem for me to ask my department to purchase the precise reference or my library to borrow the precise book, but it is very difficult for me to find such a precise reference. So I'd be very grateful if anyone could point a precise reference to this result out to me. 

A partial but quick answer. Put the equation in the natural scale, namely take $\varphi(x)=2\frac{x-1}{x+1}$ and set $Y_t = \varphi(X_t)$, then $$ dY=\frac14(4-Y^2)f\Bigl(\frac{2+Y}{2-Y}\Bigr)\,dB, $$ where $f(x)=a+b$ if $x\leq k$ and $f(x)=a$ otherwise. Feller's test tells us that any solution starting in $y\in(-2,2)$ (consider that in the natural scale $0$ is $-2$ and $\infty$ is $2$ will go to $-2$ with probability $\frac{2-y}4$ and to $2$ otherwise, but this will not happen in finite time. In particular, the solution with initial condition $-2$ has a unique strong solution. Now, choose $a$, $b$ and $k$ so that $\frac{2+y}{2-y}$ is $\mathop{sgn}$ (this is arbitrary, i need to think about the general case), then you can proceed as in the Tanaka equation: assume you have a strong solution, apply Ito-Tanaka formula to $|Y|$ and check that the driving Brownian motion is measurable with respect to $|Y|$, a contradiction. (More details on the scale function, Feller's test, and the proof of non-existence strong solution for the Tanaka equation can be found on standard references, such as this or this)
