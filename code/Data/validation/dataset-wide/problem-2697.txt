My answer actually disturbs me. I take Wittgensteins argument against private language as successful, and I take Quine's argument that language is empirical as successful. Here is an example from Wikipedia's article on Wittgenstein's private language argument: "For instance, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make any sense to talk of private sensations such as qualia; nor might it make sense to talk of a word as referring to a concept, where a concept is understood to be a private mental state." Here is a quote from Quine's essay "Epistemology naturalized"(Quine1969): "Language is socially inculcated and controlled; the inculcation and control turn strictly on the keying of sentences to shared stimulation." I'll add that there are languages that omit concepts contained in other languages. There is a language, for instance(I'm sorry, I'm going on memory. Can't find a reference) which describes time as passing us from behind going forward. Like a wind at our back. We see ourselves moving forward, time passing us like a wind in our face. There is also a language (so sorry, no reference) which does not have the concept of contradiction. I take all this to mean that the formulation of our thoughts, and, indeed the concepts it occurs to us to think about, are given to us by our language group/sub groups. Wittgenstein and Quine are saying we cannot express our thoughts independently of society, and the varying conceptual content among languages signifies that even what we think about is determined by our group. When we think about something is often determined by the context of the moment. I cannot argue that we determine a type of concept to think about, nor how to express, even to ourselves, unspoken, the concept. Pain is the classic example of private experience, which cannot be accurately expressed to others, in language, because we do not have access to how others feel when they experience it. But we do not control the experience of pain. And when we do think about it, I think we use the public language. I'm not happy about it, but I only know of arguments against individual determination of thoughts. 

What Sampaio is saying is that you can't get from 1 & 2 to 3. 1 and 2 allow you to say that any entity that is a god exists (first order predicate). But you can't then take the leap that such an entity exists because 1 and 2 don't establish that i.e. you can't go from saying that if there is an entity that's a god then it exists to a god exists (second order predicate). If you follow the predicates correctly you end up with a conclusion 3 that's something like "if there is a God then God exists", which isn't the most Earth shattering statement. 

This does not seem to be a question so particular to the music industry. And it is not a question of coming into possession of something. What is purchased in a download of a music file, for instance, but also with the purchase of a DVD, a recording of an NFL game, or a newspaper clipping, is a license to use, with terms limiting the use. We have agreed to terms with the owner of the rights of use. We have made a promise. The moral question boils down to: is there a moral obligation built into every promise? I take Searle's argument for the built in obligation of a promise, in Fact and value, "is" and "ought", and reasons for action, Searle, 2008, to be successful. The specific question is, do we make a promise when we download music? I think it is obvious we do. Musicians who feel these terms are trivial self publish and make their music freely available. The price of admission to a film includes the right to remember the experience and even to tell others about it. If the purple scarf is an original design, then copying it with an intention to sell it is wrong. Society agrees on a time period restricting selling copies of original designs, after which considering the designs to pass into public domain. Copying the scarf for your own use may or may not aggravate the designer. It would be a subjective call, and the designer should be given the opportunity to make the call. 

The interpretation of a curved spacetime in General Relativity is a consequence of the theory rather than the theory itself. The form of the theory is based on a number of postulates: 

know about the suffering be able to do something about the suffering be willing to do something about the suffering 

Even if one posits the requirement that a conscious observer is needed for waveform collapse, it is still perfectly fine to have a universe prior to the evolution of consciousness. It just means that there was only superposition and no collapse. Personally, I don't find this particularly satisfactory as an interpretation but it is self-consistent. The proposition that God is the cause of collapse suffers from being a God of the gaps argument. It isn't very valuable from a scientific point of view, as it has no predictive power. It also suffers from a philosophical point of view in that, as we understand more about the interface between quantum and classical scales, we'd be giving God less and less to do. In my experience, most atheists would be perfectly willing to believe in the existence of a god if there were incontrovertible proof. As a trite example, if giant flaming letters appeared halfway between Earth and the Sun that stated "I exist" and that everyone on Earth could read them regardless of language/blindness etc. However, without the presence of extraordinary proof, many atheists hold that the most reasonable position is to assume that no god exists. There may be atheists that hold that no evidence could, even in principle, convince them but I haven't met any. 

I do not think the possibility of holding contradictory beliefs is controversial. For instance, a simultaneous belief in a god and a causal universe is commonplace. Claiming to know both are true is controversial.. In the preface paradox I claim I both know every statement I wrote is accurate, and I know I made a mistake somewhere. In the lottery paradox I say to a friend who is buying a ticket, "I know you won't win, and I know someone will win." Say a lottery is held which guarantees a winner while maintaining the ridiculously long odds of typical lotteries. I know, with a probability greater than .99 that my friend will lose, so I confidently claim I know he will lose. I cannot claim that each participant will lose, though, because I also know someone will win. The challenge is to define criteria of knowledge which exclude contradictory knowledge claims and yet justify some knowledge claims. Gettier argues successfully that we do not know how to do this. I do not know who argues successfully that we do know how. 

I don't see why you'd need to be a working scientist to agree with this statement. Nor, in fact, do you need to believe in the truth of all scientific theories. What you would need to do is disbelieve theories that contradict all the empirical evidence available to us. That's a somewhat lower bar in my opinion. 

No. The 2 things are wholly unrelated. You are essentially requiring that the physical brain capacity required to contain the idea of something is related, in some sense, to a notion of the size of that something. This is blatantly untrue for things that have physical size e.g. your brain doesn't need to be bigger than a horse to contain the idea of a horse. Similarly, your brain doesn't need to contain the uncountable reals to contain the idea of uncountable reals. 

You are asking what happens when we become aware that what we believe to be the important driving ambition of our life is shown up as insignificant. We experience the sublime. The unpleasant awareness of something more consequential than ourselves which is outside of our knowledge. See the Ridley Scott film, The Duallists, which is based on a Joseph Conrad novel, which in turn draws on a true story of two French officers in Napolean's army who serve effectively, but their careers are consumed by an absurd perpetual standing challenge. Whenever they cross paths they must dual, and somehow they continually fail to kill one another. 

They're not in any being that we know to be conscious. If you start to define consciousness as having properties that definitely don't apply to consciousness then you're best to just make up a new word and define, explicitly, its properties. 

The main difference between situation A and situation B is that, in A, the police have already found a justification for their racial stereotyping i.e. profiling. In situation B, you're still using racial stereotyping to make a decision but you haven't found a justification that makes you comfortable with that stereotyping. Hence the question. As soon as you get an answer that you're comfortable with, you'll be in exactly the same situation as the police. It doesn't really matter how compelling the justification appears to be because you're only using it to reinforce an existing prejudice. 

-What are the philosophical implications of the Higgs mechanism? Developments in science have philosophical implications to the extent they force us to refine philosophical positions we take. Embryonic stem cell research, for instance, is forcing us to refine arguments about when a group of cells become human. A development in our understanding of matter would hopefully affect our understanding of consciousness. Questions within physics aren't, strictly speaking, philosophical questions. Whether an idea can be translated from one theoretical language to another is a philosophical question, and positivism is a dubious answer. If the question is what are the philosophical implications of the Higgs mechanism for theoretical physics then the answer has to do with how physicists handle the translating. But if the question is asking for the philosophical implications in the general sense, that is, to the extent our understanding of matter is affected by the understanding of the theory of the Higgs mechanism, then the answer is wait and see. The role of causality in consciousness is the philosophical question and the Higgs theory does not seem to be developed enough to help us refine our conception of consciousness. 

The answer for a large number of fields, including philosophy, is no. There is a lot of academic work published that has no touching points to anything remotely scientific. There is also a fair amount of research that probably should be more scientific than it is but that's a separate matter. Next I'll answer the question, again paraphrased 

Neither opinion nor objectivity are particularly tightly defined hence any statement as to the point at which they change state is, by necessity, opinion (somewhat ironically). However, what I like to use as a yardstick for objectivity is if it is feasible for others to come to the same opinion and, by applying reasonable rules of evidence and logic, they will come to the same opinion. Using this approach, MarkOxford's "I find tomato's tasty" could never be objective but "tomatoes grow on tomato plants" can be. You may note that what I've really done is replace the, somewhat vague, terms of opinion and objectivity with the, also vague, terms of feasible and reasonable. I don't believe there's a better approach but that, of course, is just my objective fact.
