I have not read the book in question, but this seems like a peculiar idea-- how would one deal with children, who do not have the capacity to enter into a contract? And, presuming that one signs such a contract on one's 18th birthday, what happens to those who refuse to sign, or wish to negotiate a different contract? And, since the power differential between the state and the individual is so immense, to what extent could one argue that the contract was not coerced? 

That's a great question. It seems to me that a telos is an essence that would need to precede existence: to have a telos is to exist for some purpose, and that purpose is necessary for, and necessarily prior to, the existence of the entity. It follows from that, it seems to me, that this particular essence must be external to the entity; if we were to say that a tooth is sharp so that an animal can efficiently digest its food, this purpose must have come from some entity outside of the tooth itself, as the purpose would have to precede the initial instance of the entity. Now, we can say that this prior entity is impersonal, and not a god-- but it still must be (it seems to me) capable of intending; if we want to say that "nature" designed the tooth, then nature must be (in this case) motivated. Put another way: if we wish to use a telos to answer a "why?" question, we are already assuming that there is an answer to the "why?", a cause, and not just an effect of an unmotivated process or regularity. I think the authors of the SEP article linked put their finger on it when they write "Final causality is here introduced as the best explanation for an aspect of nature which otherwise would remain unexplained." Rejecting the final cause is to abandon the possibility of a certain type of explanation, and to resign oneself to regularities of the type "things are the way they are because that's the way they are", or, in more Darwinian terms, the survival of the survivors. 

Teleology is, generally speaking, within the domain of theology; to speak of a final cause implies a subject who is intentionally causing the action in question, which in the global sense would apply to a god of some sort. (Naturally, teleology with regard to human actions is in the domain of psychology, but that's not what interests us here.) The history of modern science, on the other hand, has been predicated (for the most part) on a growing assumption of a naturalistic hypothesis, where recourse to a deity is off-limits; the principle of parsimony implies Occam's Razor, so positing an additional entity to serve as the subject of a telos is frowned upon, as it is more parsimonious to just assume an unmotivated process. So, in general, the more modern a scientist is, the less likely they are to partake in teleological deliberation. 

You should ask yourself two kinds of questions: First, are humans in fact naturally immoral? Why would those statements be true? Does the lived experience of men tell you anything about how they necessarily view people of other genders? Where would such behavior even come about, and is it not more plausible that it is inculcated in us by society? (Consider the motives of those who say such things. If somebody is telling you that "it is men's nature to be misogynists" my guess is they aren't doing it out of a spirit of honest intellectual inquiry.) And second, are humans in fact naturally anything? The idea that humans have free will is not a new one. If that's the case, then while there are biological requirements of humanity, there are no behavioral requirements. The idea that we "have" to act in some way is false, so there is no conflict between our "natural" obligations and our moral obligations. 

For Kant, we are prohibited from using people as purely means. Unfortunately things like physically stopping someone from doing violence onto you just because you don't want to be wounded seems to very much be using them as a means and not an end. If we are unable to literally escape* being submitted to unethical treatment, do we simply have to grin and bear it? *In the "what if an ax murderer asks me where my friend is, shouldn't I lie then" the obvious solution is to just remain silent. I'm thinking of cases where there is no similar way out, e.g., you are trapped. 

Now I haven't read Sartre, and I'm not in a position to do so any time soon, so I can't check this, but this statement seems very wrong. If only and all human beings lack essence, doesn't that mean our lack of essence is essential to us? That we do have an essence, and that essence is a lack of itself? The problem is obvious, I hope. And I find it hard to believe Sartre didn't see it. So: 

"Always already" is a strange phrase/concept I see cropping up everywhere in post-structuralist discourse, used by a wide variety of authors. I was curious as to its origin; Wikipedia says Heidegger popularized its use. But I don't know much about Heidegger, and Being and Time is too big to search through. In what passage does Heidegger first employ the term? What work does it do in his description of Dasein? (This is equivalent, I think, to asking what it means that Dasein anticipates itself.) 

At the tail end of Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason Gardner discusses Kant's influence on his successors. He claims---and I'm paraphrasing here---Hegel wanted his metaphysics to be scientific, i.e., to all unfold from a single principle. Kant's work does not descend from a single principle, but instead draws from actual experience to get us, for instance, inner and outer sense, and the specific categories. This rings true. There are certainly a number of times when Kant seems to throw his hands in the air and say that things just are. Hegel's response, quoth Gardner, was to try and make a new system, which would surpass Kant's, and all unfold from a single principle. Is this actually Hegel's definition of a science? I couldn't find anything online that would confirm it. I've only read PR and some of PS; I can't say much about Hegel's metaphysics. But in PR Hegel explicitly states that philosophy is a circle. Of course a circle has no point of origin. Did Hegel think his system did indeed unfold from a single point? How did he explain this, given the whole "philosophy is a circle" thing? 

I should preface this by saying that I am not a classicist, and will gladly defer to anybody who is more up on the literature than I am. That being said: There are the occasional folks who claim to have uncovered signs of Plato's hidden doctrines within the Platonic corpus. For example, Jay Kennedy believes that Plato was a secret Pythagorean, and that there are musical clues encoded in his writings. As you might expect, this is far from a mainstream view. The mainstream view, as you indicate above, is that there is no historical evidence of any unwritten doctrines outside of a small number of references in Aristotle (and Aristotle's epigones.) Occasionally, you will find a historian attempting to tease something out of the references, such as this article, but the passages are so brief as to permit only highly speculative readings. In short, we don't know, and have no way of knowing, what Plato didn't write. If your interest is not so much in the content of the unwritten doctrines, but in the fact that they were oral and not written, there is a body of literature on Plato and the transition from Orality to Literacy. Eric Havelock's Preface to Plato is the primary work on the subject, but it is almost half a century old. A more recent (but briefer) trip through the material can be found here. 

And many of the religious duties of people towards their god are not applicable; the duty to sacrifice animals, or dietary restrictions, or baptism or circumcision, etc. Religious systems are generally predicated on a clear distinction between god and man, not upon their interchangeability. 

You're reading Descartes out of context; he doesn't just say "cogito ergo sum" and go home, he says it in the course of an argument. I'm not going to rehearse all of the steps of the argument here-- the Meditations on First Philosophy are readily available, and easy to read-- but in broad strokes, he's asking: what do we know indubitably? Is there any kind of knowledge that it is impossible to doubt? For example, I see the cup on the table in front of me, but when I am dreaming, I often see cups? Can I be certain, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that I am not dreaming now? No, he argues-- sense perception can be doubted. But, can I doubt that I exist? Doubt is a form of thinking, and if I am thinking, I indubitably exist. Thus, no matter what else I doubt, I cannot doubt that I exist. Whether I am a bat or a person is not really relevant to the problem; if bats are capable of doubting their existence, they fall under the cogito. (If they're not, then the issue doesn't come up for them-- Descartes is not aiming to investigate bat epistemology.) I suggest you read the Meditations; they are fascinating, and brief, and a wide variety of secondary literature exists to help you along the way. And, what's more, Descartes published a number of responses to objections from his contemporaries, so we can see exactly how we would respond to a number of possible refutations.
