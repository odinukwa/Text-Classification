It has to be somewhere you put your hands to lift the bike. Check out the wheel rims. They can collect all sorts of grime when you ride in the wet. Some of it will be ground rubber from your brakes, but most is road dirt. Motor vehicles drop oil and grease, and lots of rubber on the road. If you find that is the cause, the solution is to clean them after riding in wet weather. 

If you look back at the variables listed at the top of this post, you'll see that every one of them can be changed. You can choose a different hill, with a different gradient. You can build up your strength, reduce your weight, build up endurance and aerobic capacity, choose a different pace, and choose a different gear. By keeping track of your performance, you'll get feedback on how you're going. How it feels is not generally a good indicator of performance; I only ride by feel these days: sometimes I think wow, I destroyed that hill only to check the time and find I was way off my PB. Other times I've thought Uff, that was a struggle and found that I was minutes inside my PB. In general, we get better power, and hence speed up the hill, with a higher cadence. But this is not true for everyone, as at least one of the linked articles will show. As you develop, you will need to use different approaches to get improvements. Professional coaches frequently seek to introduce novelty into the training they give their athletes, so that the athlete has a new challenge, or training stress. It's when your training provides a new stress that your body responds with new growth. So when your improvement plot reaches a plateau, make a change. Instead of cadence, work on strength, or a different gradient, or shorter climbs. Happy climbing. Ps. I left out one important way of getting stronger and faster: ride with someone who's a bit faster, or chase someone who started a little before you. A little competition does wonders :-) 

IF YOU ARE CYCLING ON A ROAD THAT HAS OMNI-DIRECTIONAL FLOW OF TRAFFIC You should simply signal to turn right if you need to or just carry on going forward. If the right-hand turn is into a road with bi-directional traffic flow, watch for any cars approaching from the right when you going straight forward. IF YOU ARE CYCLING ON A ROAD THAT HAS BI-DIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC FLOW Same as before; signal right (if you want to turn right) or keep going forward. Also, keep an eye on the oncoming or waiting traffic at the junctions. A common factor in both cases is watching behind your left-shoulder to check for any oncoming traffic before changing lanes or making turns. This is a good gesture and pays off. What you must remember is that unless approaching a junction-turn to left, you should never position yourself unnecessarily in the left-hand lane as it may block heavy traffic flow from behind (car drivers may curse you and honk). Please stay on the rightmost side of your road (without hitting pedestrians yourself on the kerb) so that the cars can simply overtake you gently. This is exactly what we do in the UK (only on the LH-side). I hope this helps. You can find lots of videos on YouTube that may help you envisage your actions more practically. 

It would have been slightly helpful if you told us from what front and back gear ratio (e.g. 2:3 or 2:4) the problem starts occurring. I had similar problems and it was even the case when I was changing to higher front gear but the cassettes (or clogs) did not change or they changed after a long time when it received external shocks from my ride. Did you check how the shifts are happening from 1(front):1(rear) onwards i.e. if you were to use the gear ratio from 1:1 to upwards? If you do this, then you will come to the point where you feel exactly from which gear ratio it is taking longer to switch cogs. Also, you might even find out once in a while changing to a higher gear actually does not change to the new cassette at all and gets stuck. One of the cable (front/rear derailleur) tension would not feel right to you. For me it was some dirt and blockage in the front derailleur lever area (i.e. the allen key-based connnector with wire clenched around) which is universally near pedals. Usually, this is a minor problem and the way to fix it was to make sure first your gear ratio is 1:1. Then, loosen the allen key just enough so that the wire comes out. Now clean around the allen key are well enough and then use a little bit of wet lube around it to finalise. Then, put the wire back in and tighten the allen key as it was before. Reccheck the gear shifting from 1:1 upwards and see if the problem is solved. This could happen even to the rear derailleur too. The key problem originator is the derailleur lever (i.e. the allen key based moving area). What happens normally is that dirt and blockage occur there and the cable tension feels higher than it should normally feel. Also, please update your question by saying for how long and where (i.e. what type of tarmac) you have used your MTB until the problem started manifesting. Also, I am assuming that you know NEVER to change both gears at the same time? If you don't know and have done this already, please don't do this again. For the investigation I mentioned above, make sure you change the gears down or up appropriately. Let us know :)....Don't forget to add the additional information to your original question :) UPDATE If these are of any help see This one And also this Hope this helps 

The Garmin Edge 205/305 Owner's Manual makes it clear that any data that was not saved using the Garmin Training Center Software would be overwritten when the device is full. The Garmin Training Center Software was last updated Aug 25, 2011. The Windows version ran on XP, but it can still be downloaded by following the links. You'd have to test if it will work on a current OS (but see the next para). Garmin has a page explaining Where is the history data for Training Center located? That page seems to suggest that the software works on Windows 7. If the data you want is present on your backup as .TCX files, then you can just upload it to Strava: 

Sounds like you know the chain will work with the sprocket on your hub. You will need to shorten the chain, if you use the same one. It's usually better to get a new chain, and make the chain just long enough so that it has a cm or so play with the back wheel a little forward of the middle of the dropouts. As the chain wears (some say stretches) you will have to move the wheel back, until the chain needs replacing. It should last a long time. 

Since you say you are out of shape, I recommend not attempting to ride there and back on the same day until you have built up to it. You have a lot of muscles and organs that need to develop to handle this new activity, so build up slowly. If you rush it you could injure yourself, and despite what some people say, at our age injuries heal more slowly. So build up slowly. The first thing you'll notice the day after your first ride is a sore bottom. There are muscles there that need to adjust - so give them a couple of days rest then ride again. It's important to take a break so that the muscles can recover, but it's equally important to ride again in two or three days so that they get the message to keep developing. So I recommend a supported first ride to work on a weekend. By supported I mean that someone will bring you and the bike home. Seven miles (~11 km) is a solid first ride for someone who is unfit and unused to riding. If you find you are struggling, stop and call in the ride home. You will now know if you can ride one way. If you can't yet, recover for a couple of days and ride the same distance again. It will probably seem harder, but keep riding every few days. If possible, drive or take a train part way to work and ride the rest. When you can ride all the way, ride to work one day and leave the bike there. Ride home two or three days later. When you are comfortable with both rides, step up to three rides per week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Leave the bike at work over the week end. When that's working OK, you have a choice - start riding there and back on the same day, or ride four times a week. If you feel ready, ride there and back on a Friday, so you have the weekend to recover. Now some theory, of sorts. Generally, we find that increasing the total training load by 10% in one week is manageable. If you step up more than that, you can expect to feel weary. After stepping up the distance you ride per week, wait until you feel on top of it before stepping up again. And some common sense. Don't expect too much of yourself. Take it steady. It is actually not a race. If you need a break then take it. If it's crap weather (too hot, too cold, too wet, too windy), skip the ride that day. As you get experience you'll cope with a wider variety of conditions, but at the start you don't need to be a hero. But keep at it. And enjoy. Everyone here does. 

FUTURE REFERENCE: Depending on how heavy your ride schedule is, you should do it ideally every 4 months or so. In this way, you keep your bike in good condition as well as the safety. You don't want to be in the middle of the traffic and bashing your head wondering why your gear is not shifting down :p I hope this helps. 

Put your gears to 1:1 position. This is the safest position to start with the optimum cable tension. Also, you will have less chances of messing things up. loosen the joint that is holding the derailleur cable for the front derailleur clutch. This is actually located near where your cassettes are (gear coggs). Clean the clutch joints and housings properly. If you have a thin-brissled brush, it is good. Otherwise, use a cleaning cloth. Clean as thoroughly as possible and make sure all the debris and small granules are not blocking any of the intersections/joints. Tighten the cable back in the joint, ideally and exactly where it was before. Check the up/down shifts for all the gear to ensure that you have got the correct tension level. 

My bike is only 7 months old, but the front derailleur cable fibres are becoming loose i.e. the individual thin metal fibres twised together to form the cable are loosing out. I think I have lost the metal cap which was holding the twisted end of the cable so that those fibres stay twisted. How can I fix this? Could anyone suggest? TA 

I think I found the solution. I lost my cable crimps and need to fix it probably by duct taping it and also using anti-fray caps. 

It would have been better if you could post some picture of the scratches on your bike to help us understand the depth of the problem. Anyway, you can use either spray, nail-polish (quick and dirty), or actual wall paint (if you have any or nick it from the neighbours' :p ). however, if you have a lot to paint on, do it a little bit at a time. But if you use your bike once in a while, you can just do all the painting at one go. The cheapest option is to get the nail polish. However, the colour would go off soon enough depending on weather conditions. Also, if you buy really cheap ones from Pound shop (or 99 cents stores if you are in the US), they won't last long. But, as I said, they are the cheapest and quickest option. See this on Amazon. They should work too. The decision is yours. 

Most people's feet are different sizes, although in your case this may be more pronounced. You could check that the cleats are in the same position relative to your foot, but I suspect the cause is elsewhere. Check that your cleats are straight, and look at your pedaling action to see if your knees and feet are straight. Your knees should come close to touching the top bar as you pedal. But the main cause of knee pain is pedaling too slowly, putting too much pressure on your knees on each pedal stroke. Since the pain is only one knee, it's possible that you're putting too much pressure on that knee. Usually the solution to try to pedal at a higher cadence (rate), using a lower gear. So you spin faster against less resistance. Try to pedal evenly, with the same pressure or force on each leg. Also compare the muscle development or strength of each leg. Are they the same? Being that it's your dominant leg, I suspect not. If not, that could be something to look into. You could work to strengthen the other leg, as well as increasing your cadence. Edit: Another thing to consider is seat height. I would expect that you would get a problem with both knees if this was the cause, but it's worth being aware of it. Generally, we get 

It's easy to spend lots of money in the first blush of enthusiasm, only to find later that it was wasted. Take it a little slower, and make sure you're getting good advice. When talking up a new sport it's easy to go about it the wrong way and cause early injuries, or develop poor habits or techniques that cause long term problems. This applies to all three triathlon legs. In the case of the cycling leg, you need to get cycling advice from a seasoned triathlete. Triathlon cycling is quite different to normal road racing, especially as the distances increase. You'll be trying to avoid using the muscle groups that provide the drive for the run leg, using a much lower cadence than a roadie would, and using a different bike. The time to consider a power meter is when you're at the stage where you have a training bike and a race bike, and both are worth more than your car. 

From your question above, i would only suggest the following (doesn't mean I don't know about the other bikes): Folding bike - for work and city/cycle lane/fairly normal surfaces only. You can also get away with usual city road hazards such as potholes and cracks (but not too extreme), also good weight support (e.g. laptop, clothes, etc.). You might find it a bit weird to suddenly switch to a folding from a normal road/hybrid/MTB. But overall, it is really great as my gf bought a Tern C8 last month(she is 5'4") and even I find it nice to ride (I am 6'3"). You can also carry it on the train and even on the aeroplane if you want. Some folding bike tyres are quite sturdy compared to hybrids so the bumps and holes can be ignored a lot more. I would still give a trial ride if I was you in order to be sure about the comfort. THIS IS QUITE PRACTICAL if you are just living a professional life and city-side commute with occasional shopping bags (about 6 kgs) behind you. MTB (Mountain Bikes) - If you want it to use on a rougher surface as well as in the cities. They are a bit heavy, but can take poundings like no other. You could even go over some road kerbs that are raised by appx. 3-4 inches. I apologise to be mean, but if you are not young enough to handle the bike weight, you might feel it difficult to go around the hills with these heavy bikes. But if you think you can, Go for this one. My suspicion based on UK prices is that you can probably get a very good MTB compared even when you double the price (if you are lucky, you might get one with suspension springs too, COOOL). It is also possible to attach some rack or similar thing behind your MTB so that you can carry weight such as your laptop and clothes to work. I never saw anybody doing it for MTB, but that really does not mean you cannot. Short answer is, if you are happy to sacrifice outdoor activity, folding bike is the answer. Otherwise, get an MTB, get rack, and voi la. Bear in mind that no matter what bike you buy, there is a maximum weight for that. I would recommend staying about 6-7 Kgs under the prescribed weight by the manufacturer/seller. It was never an issue for me anyway as I carried shopping on my folding and hybrid, about 6-7 kgs of shopping. I am really sorry but cannot guide you about the US price. If any other user finds this answer suitable, but want to edit it to put the price information, be my guest. Normally, I would put the UK prices but this would be confusing as you said yourself that the prices and the types of bike vary in the US shops. Hope this helps. If you were interested in the brands at all: Folding - Dahon, Tern, Raleigh, Brompton (around $800 sometimes due to the high demand) MTB - Jamis, Trek, Pinnacle, Raleigh (Off-road series), Fuji, Bianchi The choice is now yours, If you think I can give you more information please post follow-up comments :)
