As I see it, there are two parts to this question. 1) The base of the language - the general rules, language construction, common words, etc. These might never change significantly; the major languages are all heavily codified in dictionaries, computers, school textbooks, etc and there's little advantage in changing these. 2) There are however always new words entering languages. Especially with your space-faring civilisation, where with a vastly different environment in space and on the new planet there would be a need for lots of new words to describe things. This could, over time and when combined with new colloquialisms, create a dialect in which the language was fairly recognisable, but where a lot of what was spoken didn't make much sense. Accents may also change; until eventually you're in a situation much like a Glaswegian trying to speak to a Jamaican. 

I don't think that the government will realise that you're printing money by the volume of cash - as XKCD says, it'll hardly make a dent in the economy. What is likely to be the issue is how you launder the money - becoming a regular at the casinos might well be a good idea.(Edit - apparently it isn't, in the USA at least) Unless you have a good and believable reason as to how you got hold of all of the money you now possess, then you might well get caught that way. Your other option of course is to spend it all in pawn shops and buy up a huge quantity of precious metals, gems, etc and then take it all to a non-extradition treaty country, sell your jewellery and live like a king. 

A much better question is why does it want to eat only humans? Humans are highly intelligent, very social, vengeful and have - depending on the time in history - access to somewhere between some basic weaponry or weapons up to and including thermonuclear-armed ballistic missiles. Unless you have an exceptionally good reason to tangle with that combination, you'd be much better off eating pretty much any other animal on the planet. 

Just treat HIV like we already do. (The answer assumes that the airborne strain of HIV has been substantially toughened-up and its infectiousness increased - HIV doesn't last well outside of the body and isn't actually particularly infectious in its current form.) With antiretroviral drugs the life expectancy with HIV is around the same as for HIV-negative people (and they're generally not infectious either); whilst the cost of treating everyone would be huge, even if the whole country was infected it'd only really cause deaths amongst those who didn't take the drugs. With so many people infected, resistant strains evolving would be the biggest problem. Overall, HIV is probably not the ideal biological warfare agent - anthrax, ebola or smallpox would cause far more significant and scary effects. 

Realistically, the idea of a law being passed in secret and then immediately enforced would never stand up in court in an even and fair society - lawyers would have an absolute field-day. So with that in mind, the only way that this could work is in a totalitarian police state - in which case the government can basically just do what they want anyway. Tell the police to round up the cat-people and take their stuff, and then just proclaim that a law exists. 

It's also worth considering the things that an armoured fighting vehicle needs people to do for it. An awful lot of the role of the crew of an AFV is keeping the AFV running. However, it is worth considering that military unmanned ground vehicles are in development, primarily for logistics where the loss of a relatively inexpensive truck and some cargo is much less important than the crew - take a look at the TerraMax as an example. 

Never mind the material, it’s the quantity of fragments that will be the issue. In a typical bomb (anything from a hand-grenade to an air-dropped bomb), the mass of the fragmentation material is generally on the same order of magnitude as the mass of the explosive. That means that you’d be looking at a similar mass to the TNT equivalence of your nuclear device - eg for a megaton class weapon, you’d need a million tons of pellets. Think of it this way - if you had a bomb with a 10km blast radius, then you’d have a space in the order of 1,000km^3, or one trillion cubic metres. Put a million slugs (a pretty large number, giving you a weapon weighing several tons) and still only gives you only one small slug per 100m x 100m x 100m square. That’s not going to trouble a spaceship much. 

I think that you're possibly thinking about this in a slightly odd way. Airships are the shape that they are for two conflicting reasons - maximising buoyancy and minimising drag. The former favours a sphere and the latter a teardrop shape. A saucer is a long way from an optimal envelope mass/internal volume ratio. Your concept of combining load-bearing members with accommodation could work, but by far the simplest solution for that is to go for a conventional zeppelin design but with a monocoque section (similar to an aircraft fuselage) running parallel to the direction of travel, which can accommodate passengers/cargo and also replace a structural beam. 

There's absolutely no reason why a nutritionally-complete, dried foodstuff couldn't be made for people. In fact, search for 'Huel' which is advertised as exactly that. It's just that there's not a huge demand for it, as fresh food and a variety of it is much more palatable and enjoyable. It may well have some use in disaster-relief or survival situations, where water is plentiful but food is scarce. 

It's a good question with a lot of variables... In particular, are you talking about simple, oral memories passed down through the generation? If that's the case, it's unlikely - I doubt any species has any understanding of us at present, so if the species descends from a current one then there will be no shared memory. However, evidence of humanity will remain for a long time after we're gone - and the more advanced the civilisation, the more they'll notice. Once they're at the stage of archaeology, 21st century human civilisation will yield a bonanza of evidence for them. 

I think that people are significantly overstating the importance of GPS and other satellite-based systems in modern warfare. They are very useful in low-intensity conflicts but given the likely use of Anti-satellite weapons by any near-peer enemy all forces will have organic capabilities to replicate those reliant on satellites. A marine expeditionary unit has organic aviation capabilities which could reconnoitre and mark targets for artillery. Unless your MEU is very foolhardy it would be very difficult for them to lose, as long as they conserve fuel and ammunition. A Napoleonic army would barely stand a chance against modern infantry (remember that musketry was considered at a decent level if they could fire 2 shots per minute in any weather - rapid fire in a modern army is thirty rounds per minute) let alone the likes of Harrier attack aircraft or the M1 tank. The MEU also has the advantage of basing - they can sit offshore in their amphibious assault ship, which can easily defeat Napoleonic-era warships just using the 20mm anti-aircraft weapons; that's assuming that the Harriers and Cobras don't sink any attackers first. If the rest of the World was happy to pool all of their resources and throw everything that they had - including taking tens of thousands of casualties - then they might just be able to win by sheer force of numbers; but I'm pretty sure they'd seek a truce. 

So even before you get to the scientific reasons why it couldn't work (and the other answers show this very well) there are good reasons why it wouldn't be very helpful even if it was possible. 

I would think that the simple answer is exactly the same sort of weapon that you'd take with you on Earth, perhaps a slightly more advanced version to make it a little more lightweight. If you're just planning on keeping bears and wolves (or similar aliens) at bay then a .45 or similar handgun and 100-odd rounds of ammunition per colonist would do the trick at a total weight of 3-4kg each. For hunting, you might want to go a little bigger, such as a rifle. 

Both have a good reason to limit the development of anything that makes ships vulnerable, and the power (economic, diplomatic and military) to keep the Status Quo. Neither power will want to risk developing the devices themselves, as this will likely erode their power relative to smaller nations in time to a sufficient degree to make their temporary advantage over the other power un-worthwhile. No smaller power can risk the wrath of the two larger powers. Then have the treaty enforced by inspections, etc and off you go. The chances are though that such things will fall by the wayside on day 1 of a major war - but there is a reasonable chance that if the treaty has been successful, that development will be at a very basic stage when things kick off. 

In a purely terminological sense, there is no difference between a torpedo and a missile if they inhabit the same space - a missile is a guided, self-propelled weapon that travels through the air and a torpedo is a self-propelled weapon that travels through the water (in modern terms, inevitably guided as well). My first thought though could be to do with the method of damage. In the anti-shipping mode, torpedoes are fuzed to detonate below the ship and use the effects of pressure and cavitation to effect damage on the target. Missiles have a very wide range of destructive modes, but they do include direct strikes against targets (admittedly, some anti-submarine torpedoes also use direct contact and shaped charges, but never mind...). My thought would be that the difference in space could be that torpedoes are heavyweight weapons with large warheads that can damage enemy ships even without a direct hit, whilst a missile is a smaller, more manoeuvrable weapon that would need a direct hit. Another possibility is the difference in the contemporary world between ballistic and cruise missiles - a cruise missile's engine works for the entire flight, whereas a ballistic missile boosts in the early stages of its flight and then follows a trajectory towards its target. A torpedo could be a very long-ranged weapon that has a long burn time for the greatest propulsive efficiency (possibly for attacking stationary or non-manoeuvring targets) whilst a missile has a fast boost-only engine for getting it up to high speed as fast as possible, in combat against targets directly threatening the launch platform.
