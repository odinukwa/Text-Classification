EDIT: Now the server is not checking in with the WSUS server. I removed it from the list of computers and waiting for it to check back in and report. It will not report. I am not running a proxy sever and port 8530 is allowed through the firewall. What could be causing this? EDIT: This error seems to come up every time it checks for updates in the log . I also see one saying Still can't find a cause yet. EDIT: Was able to run the Powershell script to install the WSUS feature. Clean removed WSUS, WID, IIS and cleaned registry and files and restarted before running the powershell command. Now I am getting an issue where I can't get WSUS postinstall to complete. It gets to the following and then says failed to complete. 

I have a primary domain XXX.com running DHCP. I have a Child domain child.xxx.com running Static IP. In Active Directory Sites and Services I have both DCs under one group. I am able to ping and access files from the Primary DC to the Child DC. Main problem is I can't access the Active Directory from my primary domain control for the Child domain. In my server manager I can see the server but it says "Kerberos authentication error." Both servers are running Windows Server 2016. I tried to setup the child on a DHCP subnet but when it didn't work I put the server back in to the group in ADSS. I am afraid I broke some kind of trust that I can't fix. I am looking to at least get communication back before I figure out my subnet problem. What did I forget to change so that I can access my child A/D from my parent DC? 

SETUP - I am running a small network with Windows Server 2008 R2 on it. I have 2 GPOs running security settings required by my company. In the following Hierachy: 

I have a Windows 7 Professional I had in an UO called "Testing" using Windows Server 2008 R2. In the OU a GPO setting to disable the registry access was set: User Configurations/Administrative templates/System/Prevent access to the registry - Enabled I have since removed this GPO from this OU and no other GPO is altering that settings. That GPO is no longer linked in the OU and it is removed. Problem is when I try to access the registry on the machine I am still blocked. Looking into the RSOP it shows the computer is still playing the setting. How can it still be set if no GPO is telling it to remain set? And how can I remove this setting from being set and bring it back to "Not Configured"? 

So it seems there is something about the disk I need to configure first. I will post the solution once I figure it out. Original Post I have a Dell PowerEdge T410 server with Windows Server 2008 R2. Storage is configured in a RAID-5 array. Everything has been working fine for several years, although I've had to swap out failed drives a couple of times here and there and rebuild. Until now, rebuilding has not been an issue, and the Open Manage software makes it pretty easy to manage. With the latest drive failure, however, I am seeing something different. I bought a new drive (same manufacturer, model number, and capacity as the other three in the array), and after popping it in, I deleted the virtual disk automatically created for it and assigned the disk as the hot spare for my array. From there, the rebuild is seemingly initiated, but progress never goes beyond 0% (it has been about 18 hours since it was initiated). Here is what I am seeing: 

I've checked windows logs and don't see any failures or errors related to this within the past 24 hours (when I first swapped out the disk). Looking at the OMSA logs, it tells me when I unassign a global hotspare, but there is never an event corresponding with me assigning a global hotspare. Similarly, I see notices when I cancel a rebuild but never when it is initiated after assigning a global hot spare. I've done some looking into similar problems, but most people receive an error or an actual failure during rebuilding, which I am not. I have good backups and the system is still running okay, so my next thought is to just take an image, blow away the array and start from scratch. I am mostly looking for other ideas before going that route. 

Okay, so I'm still not entirely sure what solved this problem, but the array is now rebuilding. The first thing I did was to remove OMSA completely and do a clean install (when I upgraded before, I went from 7.4 to 8.2 using an upgrade package). After uninstalling OMSA 7.4, I rebooted the server and went into the PERC S300 array manager that is an option on boot. There, it was showing Disk 0 as Ready and Disk 1 as being the Spare (OMSA did not show disk 1 as being a spare). I set Disk 0 to the Spare and unassigned Disk 1 from the Spare. After that, I proceeded to boot and install OMSA 8.2. After installation, I went to view my virtual disk and viola, it was finally rebuilding. 

Added the key and restarted the Windows Remote Management service and SERVER1 can now refresh status with SERVER2. Did a quick check on the Listener for WinRM and found it was listening through port 5296 but had no firewall rule to allow it through. Made a firewall rules and now both servers are talking. To check your WinRM comms go to CMD and run the following commands. 

I have uninstalled and reinstalled the components 3 times and I get the same issue. I cannot rebuild this server. How can I fix this WID issue to get the database working for WSUS? 

I am trying to apply a service through GPO Computer Management Preferences. I have an option that states "Apply Once And Never Apply Again". Searching on this option comes up with this information: 

I am trying to figure out why my Server 2 which is a domain controller is getting an error saying "Access Denied" when I am trying to access group policy management. I have checked and it is giving some kind of Kerberos error. I am unsure how to fix the Access is denied error. Active directory seems to be working. When I do an NLTEST it says that it is seeing itself as the DC it is getting information from. Here is where it gets weird. After going into some of the errors I found that I cannot access anything when I try to access the Server1 which is my Fully Qualified Domain server or primary Domain controller. When I try to go to file shares on the PDC from the BDC it states I don't have access. When I go the opposite direction things work out correctly. Now when I checked the event logs it states it has been to long since replication has happened to the Server2 from Server1. As far as I can tell Server2 has not access to get to Server1. I am stumped. OH AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE the group policy set on Server2 will not allow for registry editing. As started before I think this is a Kerberos thing but I can't figure out how to reset or even sync the Kerberos passwords with this access is denied problem. And this whole mess started when one of our servers time clock messed up do to a bad CMOS battery. So the Server1 time is set correctly and so is Server2 but still getting an issue. I am getting this error -> The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error I have done some research and I don't have any way of getting around that. Can anyone help me or give me some guidance as I have not mucked around with FQDNs and 2 DCs at the same time. And it makes it more a pain I can't edit the registry or the fact that it is looking to itself as a domain for references. Can any one help me with my replication issue? 

("FTP (All)" service object uses the same ports listed above - TCP 20, 21, 49152 - 65535). I am not very confident in what this rule is doing, but I think this is what allows passive connections to my server from external sources. However, I don't know if it is causing problems when I am trying to connect to external sources. -- Using the Sonicwall's packet monitor, I am able to login to the server and issue a PORT command which returns a 200 PORT successful response. However, after the LIST command is issued, my server never ACKs the SYN message (frame #57/58) sent by the FTP server. The FTP Server then retransmits the SYNs (frame 64/65 and 72/73). When it doesn't receive an ACK in the timeout window, it times out. Here is some output from the Sonicwall's packet monitor during an attempted connection: 

(Note that any missing frames in the sequence above are due to other traffic I filtered out from this view). From my LAN machine, the ACK is sent back after the LIST command and data transfers work just fine. -- So while I have diagnosed it to this point, I don't know what to do next. The router doesn't say it's dropping any packets or blocking anything due to a firewall rule. Any ideas as to why my LAN machine sends the ACK but the DMZ machine doesn't? 

I am confident in my NAT policies - People can connect to MY FTP server just fine, and I can connect to other FTP servers from inside my DMZ - there's only one specific server where this is a problem. The connection used to work fine before I upgraded my firewall from a Cisco SA520 to the Dell Sonicwall SOHO. I will also note that while I can connect to other FTP servers, those servers connect in passive mode, so it could be an issue with active mode connections. Currently, the problem server only accepts active mode from my IP. My current thinking is that it's a firewall issue on my end, but I can't understand why. My Firewall rules are pretty simple: 

I know there are a ton of similar questions already, but I've read through just about everything I could find and am still having trouble resolving my specific issue. Problem: I am having difficulty transferring data to an external FTP server, but only from an FTP client running on a server located inside my DMZ. Transferring from an FTP client works fine from any machine inside my LAN. A brief overview of my environment: I have a Sonicwall SOHO router/firewall with the following interfaces configured/connected:
