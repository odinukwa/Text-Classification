Yes. Let $f$ be univalent, with image in the open right half-plane. Then $f^2$ is also univalent. Applying the standard growth estimate for univalent functions to $f^2$, we conclude that $f$ satisfies your growth condition. To arrange that $f$ satisfies the second condition, notice that we only need $\limsup|f(z)|=\infty$ at every point of the unit circle (Then your condition easily follows. For the point $1$, you first take a sequence of boundary points tending to $1$, then a sequence tending to each point of this sequence where $f\to\infty$, then a diagonal sequence.). To ensure that $\limsup|f(z)|=\infty$ at every point, one can use geometric construction of the image. Begin with some disc in the right half-plane. Then dig narrow channels from the circumference to infinity, and continue digging channels from dense sets of boundary points... Or look at the pictures in Collingwood Lohwater, The theory of cluster sets. Or look at the pictures of unbounded normality regions in transcendental dynamics, for example, $URL$ according to a theorem of Baker, all these regions have the property that infinity belongs to the impression of every prime end, which exactly means that your mapping function has the required property. 

I do not know of such database, but I like the idea of having one very much. Then we can ask all students passing the language exam to contribute to it:-) Mathematical papers are very rarely translated from French and German to English. (Most papers of Gauss and Riemann are not available in a good English translation). Unlike Russian papers: almost all main Russian journals are translated cover-to-cover, at least this was the case few years ago. Presumably people think that if you understand the alphabet then you can read mathematics written in this alphabet in any language:-) Meanwhile, before this database is created, you can submit your translation to the arXiv. People do submit translations to the arxiv. Search for example on the name: Euler. 

Let $A_r = \{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|\leq 1\}\cup\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z-1|\leq r\}$ be the unit disk with a small "bump" (I'm interested in the regime $r\to 0$). What can be said about the logarithmic capacity of $A_r$? I can prove that there exists a constant $\gamma>0$ such that $\mathop{\mathrm{cap}}(A_r)=\gamma r^2 + $terms of smaller order, but have no idea about how to obtain the value of $\gamma$. Related to the above question: is there any useful explicit form of the conformal mapping of $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \Im(z)\leq 0\}$ to $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \Im(z)\leq 0\}\cup \{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|\leq 1\}$? 

Notice that the number of Catalan paths of area at least $cn^{\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon}$ is less than the number of all paths that deviate from the horizontal axis by at least $n^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$. Let $(S_k, k\geq 0)$ be the one-dimensional simple random walk starting from the origin. We need to find an upper bound for the following probability: $$P\big[\max_{k\leq 2n}S_k > n^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}\big].$$ Now, one may use e.g. a Chernoff's bound for the Binomial distribution (together with the Reflection Principle if you don't want an extra polynomial term in front, see e.g. Chapter III of the Feller's book) to obtain that the above probability is upper bounded by $\exp(-c'n^{\varepsilon})$. So, the total number of such paths is at most $4^n\exp(-c'n^{\varepsilon})$. 

See Example 8d of Section 4.8 of "A 1st course in Probability" by Sheldon Ross. Here it is: If independent trials, each resulting in a success with probability $p$, are performed, what is the probability of $r$ successes occurring before $m$ failures? Solution. The solution will be arrived at by noting that $r$ successes will occur before $m$ failures if and only if the $r$th success occurs no later than the $(r + m − 1)$th trial. This follows because if the $r$th success occurs before or at the $(r + m − 1)$th trial, then it must have occurred before the $m$th failure, and conversely. Hence, from Equation (8.2) (that's the explicit form of the Negative Binomial distribution), the desired probability is $$ \sum_{n=r}^{r+m-1} \binom{n-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{n-r}. $$ 

I agree with the previous answer: it is difficult to state what an average mathematician "should" know. (I dare to conjecture that there is no such thing!) Each university has its own opinion on this: look at the graduate programs, and notice which courses are mandatory. In some countries this is decided by the state. I can share my own experience of an "average mathematician". As student I has a 1-semester course of logic (it was required), the text was E. Mendelson, Introduction to mathematical logic, but we did not cover the whole book. (In my country the curriculum was established by the state and a course of logic was required). At the same time I read Lyndon, Notes on logic, and I liked this small and very clear book. After my first year, I decided that I will do something else, not logic, and never read anything else on the subject. 

I don't know the true philosophical reason, but $Z_2$ symmetry is really omnipresent in Matematics and in the nature. For example, most animals, including practically all vertebrate animals (like ourselves) have aproximately $Z_2$ symmetric bodies, and no larger group. This suggests that $Z_2$ was the favorite group of the Creator, at least in that period of his activity when we was creating advanced animals:-) If you prefer Evolution, this $Z_2$ symmetry must somehow be explained by the survival of the fittest. I don't know exactly how, but this suggests that this is a very important group. Notice that plants, mushrooms, and simplest animals usually do not have it. As a result of this (2-fold symmetry of animal bodies) we tend to like this kind of symmetry. Look at all our technology: cars, ships, airplanes, etc. They all have 2-fold symmetry, at least from outside (like our bodies, they also have this symmetry only outside). Once my friend, an airspace engineer, told me that there was a project of an airplane which did not have this outside 2-fold symmetry. The project was rejected for the only reason that "no one will want to fly in such an airplane". I am serious: $URL$ In mathematics, from my personal perspective, it is $z\mapsto\overline{z}$ first of all. (Once I even proposed to my co-author to call one of our papers "Some applications of representation theory of $Z_2$"); the paper was full of different representations of this group, We were working on real algebraic geometry.) This very same symmetry $z\mapsto\overline{z}$ is also hidden in Hermitian symmetry, $C^*$ algebras, all sorts of "duality" everywhere, etc. Which suggests that the Creator of the Universe always had a strong bias in favor of this particular group. 

Heuristically, this probability should behave as $O(\sqrt{L/n})$, I guess. Observe that each queue, when not empty, is a random walk with zero drift, that actually moves once every $O(L^{-1})$ instances of time. So, up to time $n$ it would jump roughly $n/L$ times, and therefore visit the origin about $\sqrt{n/L}$ times and so there will be around the same (in order) number of instances when the walk "attempts to jump to (-1)", that is, the empty queue is selected. Overall, there would be around $L\times\sqrt{n/L}=\sqrt{Ln}$ such moments up to time $n$, and so that probability should behave as indicated. Of course, this does not take the interactions into account; but my intuition says that wouldn't change the order, only constants. I'm pretty sure that one can analyse the case $L=2$ very accurately, but I'm not so sure about larger $L$'s. 

We now have a proof of a weaker result (only Hölderness), see Proposition 1.3 of $URL$ . The Lipschitzness is still beyond our reach... 

Let $Z(m)$ be the number of uncovered (= not chosen) sites after $m$ trials. First, we have $$\mathbb{E} Z(N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N)=N\times(1-N^{-a})^{N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N}\approx N^{-\epsilon},$$ so you can use Chebyshev inequality to bound $\mathbb{P}[Z(N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N)\geq 1]$ from above. Then, for the result in the other direction, use the Paley-Zigmund inequality, $\mathbb{P}[Z>0]\geq (\mathbb{E}Z)^2/(\mathbb{E}Z^2)$. Clearly, $\mathbb{E} Z(N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N)\approx N^{\epsilon}$, and you write $Z(N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N)$ as a sum of indicators, square it etc., to prove that $\mathbb{E} [Z(N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N)]^2$ is $N^{2\epsilon}+$terms of smaller order. So, this way you can obtain that $N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N$ trials will be enough (to choose everybody at least once) with probability at least $1-O(N^{-\epsilon})$, and $N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N$ trials will be not enough also with probability at least $1-O(N^{-\epsilon})$. 

There is a standard way to associate an algebraic curve to a linear pencil of matrices: to a one dimensional family $A+Bt$ we associate $$\det(A+Bt-\lambda I)=0.$$ When $B$ has image of dimension $1$, this is of first degree in $t$; solving with respect to $t$ we obtain a rational function associated to the pair $A,B$. EDIT. But of course this is not the only way. As another example, you can consider $2\times (d+1)$ matrices of rank at least $1$, and associate to them rational functions of degree $d$ by using the entries in the natural order as coefficients of the numerator and denominator. Some of these functions will be reducible, and have smaller degree. This correspondence leads to a useful geometric interpretation of the Grassmannian $G(2,d+1)$, see, for example, MR1931599, MR1888795, MR2196025, MR1917479. 

I am familiar with a lot of modern research in algebraic geometry (over complex or real numbers) where only very classical algebraic geometry is used (pre Grothendieck). It is both "pure" and "applied". (S. Abhyankar worked in the same department where I am:-) But of course I cannot EXCLUDE that some modern algebraic geometry is useful in some applied questions, even very applied ones like control theory. Usually this is a question of training of the writer, and his/her intended audience. In most cases, modern algebraic geometry (Hartshorne-like) can be translated into completely classical terms. So in many cases this is simply a choice of language and thus depends on the author's preferences. Of course, there is a problem that it is hard for people without this modern training to understand the papers written in the modern language. But there are several areas of algebraic geometry (both pure and applied) where the classical language still dominates. As an example, where modern language is used in "applications" (to differential equations) I can mention this book: MR1117227 Malgrange, B. Équations différentielles à coefficients polynomiaux. Birkhäuser Boston, Inc., Boston, MA, 1991. which most people with classical training in differential equations cannot read. 

I've had difficulty finding sources which treat the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over (compact and noncompact) Riemann surfaces. Note that by "bundle", I mean a holomorphic fiber bundle, which means it is locally holomorphically trivial. I'm really just looking for information about holomorphic disc bundles, but if you want a specific question: What is the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over a Riemann surface? 

If $M$ is a smooth complex manifold and $N$ is a smooth complex surface, we may ask when a holomorphic map $f:M\rightarrow N$ lifts to a map $f:M\rightarrow [N:p]$, where $[N:p]$ denotes the blowup of $N$ in a point $p\in N$. The answer, which provides a universal property for $[N:p]$, is that the map lifts whenever the pullback of the ideal sheaf of $p$, i.e. $f^{-1}I_p\otimes_{f^{-1}O_N}O_M$, is locally free of rank 1 on $M$. In other words, the functions $x,y$ cutting out $p$ pull back to $M$ to define a divisor. Question: Let $M$ be a smooth real manifold and $N$ a smooth complex surface. When does a smooth map $f:M\rightarrow N$ lift to the complex blowup $[N:p]$? I believe it is true that the map lifts whenever $f^{-1}I_p\otimes_{f^{-1}O_N} C^\infty_M$ is locally free of rank 1 over the sheaf of $C^\infty$ complex-valued functions, in other words it generates a complex line bundle. I would especially like to know if this result appears in the literature. 

There's a paper of H. L. Royden "Holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber", Proc. AMS, Volume 43, Number 2, April 1974 which proves "Theorem: The holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber M and base B are in natural one-to-one correspondence with the homomor- phisms of the fundamental group of B into the group of biholomorphic automorphisms of M onto itself. " In other words, it appears that holomorphic disc bundles are naturally flat. Note: the first projection $p_1: \mathbb{B}^2\to \mathbb{D}$ of the real 4-ball to the disc is not a holomorphic bundle of discs, because it is not locally trivial. To see why, suppose we have an isomorphism $f:p_1^{-1}(D)\to D\times \mathbb{D}$ of bundles over a sufficently small disc $D$ of radius $r<1$ around zero. Write $f(x,y) = (x, f_2(x,y))$. Now choose $y_0\in p_1^{-1}(0)$ with $\sqrt{1-r^2} <|y_0|< 1$, so that it is sent via the second projection $p_2:\mathbb{B}^2\to\mathbb{D}$ outside the disc of radius $\sqrt{1-r^2}$. By assumption, $p_1$ has a section $s$ over $D$ passing through $y_0$ -- this is just a level set of $f_2$. Composing, we obtain $ h=p_2\circ s : D\to \mathbb{D}$. I claim $h$ fails the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions. Why? Any circle of sufficiently large radius in $D$ must be sent by $h$ inside a disc of radius strictly less than $|y_0|$ around $0$. Meanwhile, the center of the disc $D$ is sent to $p_2(y_0)$, which has norm equal to $|y_0|$. This goes against the maximum principle or the Gauss mean value theorem, if you like. 

Doesn't it follow from the Lévy's continuity theorem? I mean, consider the characteristic functions of $S_{n-1}/s_n$ and $X_n/s_n$, the product of them converges to $e^{-t^2/2}$, so the characteristic function of $X_n/s_n$ converges to what it should, so $X_n/s_n$ converges. 

There is an example in the book "Essentials of Stochastic processes" of Durrett, which shows that, in general, $m$ need not be equal to $2n-2$ (it is Example 4.5 of the chapter devoted to Markov chains, Durrett calls this example "Mathematician's nightmare"). The state space of the chain is $\{0,1,\ldots,14\}$, from $0$ it jumps to $5,9,14$ with equal probabilities, from other states $x>0$ it always jumps to $x-1$. It is then claimed that $m$ is at least $30$ for this chain (I didn't do the calculations myself, though). 

I think the correct asymptotics should be rather $O(\frac{n}{\log n})$. That's because when you have $n$ numbers in your set and $n$ is large, then you knock out roughly $U^{-1}$ numbers, where $U$ is a Uniform$[0,1]$ random variable (indeed, if $k$ is chosen, then you through out approximately $\frac{n}{k}=\big(\frac{k}{n}\big)^{-1}$ numbers). Now, $\sum_{j=1}^m U_j^{-1}$ grows roughly as $m\log m$, so you need around $O(\frac{n}{\log n})$ steps to "considerably decrease" you set (say, to the size of $\frac{n}{\log n}$, since then it's enough to just decrease linearly). Hopefully, this heuristics can be turned into proof, since on the "early stages" the "double-erasing attempts" (i.e., when you try to remove a number that was already removed before) shouldn't contribute a lot. 

No, the CLT need not hold under these assumptions. Consider the following example: take $p=1/2$ for definiteness, and divide the (discrete) time into intervals $I_1=[1,2]$, $I_n=(2^{n-1}, 2^n]$, $n\geq 2$. On each interval, let $(X_k, k\in I_n)$ be the i.i.d. Bernoulli($1/2$) conditioned on $\sum_{k\in I_n}X_k=|I_n|/2$ (think about placing $|I_n|/2$ balls into $|I_n|$ urns at random); clearly, $(X_i,X_j)$ are negatively correlated when $i,j\in I_n$ for some $n$. Then the CLT doesn't hold since the sum becomes deterministic from time to time. The correlations are not strictly negative though (because the $X$'s are independent if belong to different intervals), but you can probably make them so by some "small" perturbation.
