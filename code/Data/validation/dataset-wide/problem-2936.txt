"Need" and "want" are words in the English language. Their job is to convey information from one person to another. In the case of these words, this leads to uses of the word which do not match the most extreme meanings of the words. As an example, it is highly common in the English language to use "need" to mean you have not chosen to think through how you will live without it. It is highly common to hear something like "I need that painting." "Monsieur has chosen L'arc de triumph, the artists final work. It costs $4,500,000." Then there's a pause, and "Well, maybe I can just look at it when it's on display." In many cases, trying to replace "need" with "want," while technically more precise, can cause more confusion because people do not expect such precision. It can disrupt communication until the other party realizes that you are not using "need" the way everyone else in the world uses it, and instead are using "need" in a mathematically strict way. 

This is a concern I have with how science is taught these days. Good for you for being frustrated by it! Electrons move how electrons move. That's all we can really say (and even then, we have to question whether electrons exist at all). However, science has been able to construct models of how the universe functions, including those which involve electrons spinning around. These models are valued because they are "consistent" with the observed behavior of our universe. As best as we can tell, there are things that we call electrons, and they orbit the nucleus in some ways. Are we positive this model is "true?" No. Are we confident enough in its predictive abilities to hang several multi-billion dollar industries on the assumptions that its predictions are useful, yes. We have mounds of experimental evidence which suggests this is an effective way of thinking about the world. Now it should be reasonable to assume that there can be many models for the same behavior. There may be a model of an electron whizzing around in a circular orbit, and there may be a model of a quantum fuzz of electron probabilities (which is likely the "latest theory" your teacher mentions). Both may be consistent with much of the data we have collected over the years, but the latter model would be consistent with some of the more extreme cases, where we really stretched the theories to their limits. If you are not operating in a region where you're stressing the theories to the limit, both theories are consistent with the universe to the fidelity you are concerned with. It may be very easy to demonstrate some phenomenon with the orbiting electron which requires advanced mathematics to demonstrate using the more advanced model. So long as all of the effects you are concerned with remain in the region where the two models are consistent, you can get away with using the simpler one. If you enter the regions where they start to differ (such as semiconductor physics), you will find that the two models give you different results, but only one of them is consistent with the experimental data. A skilled scientist knows when they can get away with using a simpler model, and when they have to move up to the more complicated one. As an example, take the Coriolis effect. In theory the "most correct" model of how the macroscopic world works is General Relativity (GR), so we would theoretically need to use GR equations to show the Coriolis effect. However, we know that GR and Newtonian physics are "consistent" at small velocities (read: small fractions of the speed of light). Thus instead, we can show the math behind the Coriolis effect using the much simpler Newtonian physics. If we were ever to explore the Coriolis effect on particles traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we would find we need to use the far more complicated GR models to accurately show what happens. 

The answer depends on your definitions. You provide one set of definitions, but they aren't the only ones. Alan Watts often pointed out that there are two ways to treat yourself or other humans. You can say "I came into this world," or you can say "I came out of it." If you say that you came into this world, then you are not of this world, and thus you can draw a line between what you do and what "natural" things do. On the other hand, if you say you came out of this world, your argument appears: that you are indeed natural and the concept of anything that is not-natural is simply foolishness. So it is reasonable to say that, if we follow your logic, an iPhone is a natural product. However, I'd point out that we did so by stating "all things are natural products," so we're really begging the conclusion here. I'd prefer to say that, using your logic, the concept of "natural" becomes a meaningless concept, so stating that an iPhone is natural is a rather meaningless statement in the first place. However if we use the other approach, where that which is human is not natural, then we come to the conclusion that an iPhone is not natural rather easily. 

I'd be tempted to call it an is-ought failure, although it is presented in the inverse of the usual relationship.* Typically when a speaker is using this construction, they believe the reason ought to be common sense, but they choose to claim that the reason is common sense instead. This often occurs in situations where the speaker really doesn't want to take the time to get into the reason, or perhaps doesn't even have enough of a introspective understanding of the reason to subject it to questioning. * Most sources I see consider the is-ought problem to be when people take what "is" and assume it is what "ought" to be. In this case, you likely have someone who is taking what they believe it "ought" to be, and calling it "is" 

There are a lot of systems which have the property that you can prove they must be inconsistent, but actually finding the inconsistency is arbitrarily expensive. I think you may find some such systems in cryptography. An arbitrary example would be any system containing 

No. The reason she is not giving you a fallacy is because the discussion is not one grounded in logical persuasion, thus the term "fallacy" is not a meaningful one. The conversation is actually grounded in conversational etiquette, which abides by different rules. Using that frame of reference, the conversation can be seen much more clearly. She clearly has a desire for you to give her money, but etiquette prevents her from making it outright. If she made the request outright, then the transaction would be "for $50000US, I'll marry you," which is a decidedly uncouth statement to make. The purpose of such oblique wordings is very dependent on the tone of voice she chose to use (tone of voice does not extend to logical arguments very well). If her tone was joking, she has simply stated that she needs to take care of her parents. If her tone was serious, she has put the ball in your court. You may elect to offer to give her money, spontaneously, or not. If this situation is actually a serious conversation (as opposed to one of many joking tones it might have been), then I would recommend walking away from said relationship. If she cannot accept "marry me first, and then we'll support your family" as an option, we have several derogatory terms for those who try to use the allure of marriage for financial gain. Worse would be the derogatory terms for those who are sufficiently duplicitous to claim they have standards while doing so. Fortunately, without knowing the tone of voice used, we can simply presume she was joking (which is more likely the reality). In such a case, I would consider giving her a spontaneous donation of 50,000 in monopoly money. Bonus points for then offering her a ring-pop ring. 

As things go, they have found it is not possible to map the mathematics of the quantum mechanics model into reality without sacrificing one of these attributes. Something has to go. The Copenhagen interpretation, by far the most famous, sacrificed determinism. It stated that an observation would cause a "waveform collapse" which turns a superposition of quantum states into a single classical state. Which state it ends up with is defined randomly, using probability theory. Most people's understanding of quantum uncertainty derives from the Copenhagen interpretation because it won the political fight and because enshrined as the most popular interpretation. However, its full of confusion. Every student worth their salt eventually asks "what is an observation anyways?" It seems like a pretty important thing, since it causes waveforms to collapse. It turns out that the naive answers to this question rapidly turn into dead ends. The double-slit experiment series of experiments typically frustrates new students indoctrinated into the Copenhagen interpretation, and they become enamored with this concept of 'uncertainty' until they develop enough math to move beyond this phase. Other interpretations give up different things. One interpretation is, in my opinion, highly helpful for you in understanding the issues you are exploring: The Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI). MWI is a complete deterministic interpretation, meaning the state of the current universe fully describes the future state of the universe with no uncertainty. How does it accomplish this? It gives up something dear: realism. Under MWI, one cannot say that any object has an objective state which is measurable. Instead, it is assumed that all states are subjective with respect to an observer. In MWI, you cannot say "the moon exists," but must rather say "whether the moon exists is consistent with my observations of whether the moon exists." By making this sacrifice, rather than determinism, MWI actually makes it much simpler to stick to the actual mathematics. Take Schrodinger's cat. For Copenhagen enthusiasts, this is a very exacting study in word choice. There's nothing in the Copenhagen interpretation which misrepresents what happens in the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment, but most people start to break out into hives at the idea of a cat that is in a superposition of states of both dead and alive (colloquially termed "half alive and half dead," though that is actually not technically precise wording, and leads people astray). Now consider MWI. Like Copenhagen, MWI starts by describing the cat in a superposition of states entangled with the state of the radioactive isotope in the box. However, once the observation happens, instead of having some complicated wave form collapse occur, MWI takes a simpler approach. The cat's state (alive or dead), cannot be talked about objectively. It can only be discussed with respect to the observer. Thus, we say "The cat's state is consistent with the observer's observed state. Iff the cat is alive, we can be certain the observer measured it as alive. Iff the cat is dead, we can be certain the observer measured it as dead." Case closed. It's elegant really... if you can stomach the possibility that the universe may not be "real." So this is why I say quantum indeterminacy is inextricable from observation. The indeterminacy only comes into the story once one begins to use an interpretation to tie the mathematical model into having empirical meaning in our universe. Different interpretations have different ways of handling this, including some which permit complete determinism in the universe. If you can permit a deterministic interpretation of QM, then indeterminism must be tied into the interpretation, not anything in the mathematics below. 

I find the line, if it exists, tends to depend on the topic. Everything which is part of X is part of X, which means it has to follow all of the rules and ideals X contains. However, most X are not self-verifying. They almost always have some assumptions which cannot be presumed using X's rules and ideals. At that point, the philosophy of X takes over, and starts commenting on why those assumptions were valid and meaningful in the first place. In the case of science this is easy. Science follows the scientific method, so if you want to see if something is scientific, you look at its method and see if it follows it. However, is the scientific method, itself, scientific? Science can't really answer that question without infinite regress, so the question of the validity of the scientific method for empirical study is in the realm of the philosophy of science. In the case of religion, this can be more blurry. Religions are often rely on belief for their fundamental axioms, so they have a natural need to explain why those beliefs make sense. We often see overlap between religion and the philosophy of religion, as can be seen by centuries of philosophers defending positions which were staunchly Christian. In these cases, the philosophy of religion often covers the points where religion gets tired of trying to give reasons why or find the level of precision of language distasteful (such as the "if God is omnipotent..."). This answer is very similar in nature to Shane's answer. However, I think Shane's answer works better when there is a clear definition of first-order questions and my answer works better when you may support a few layers of second-order questions within X before turning to philosophy of X for the next layer.
