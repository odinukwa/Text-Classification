Because 4. That's so much time compared to a bow, it's not feasible. A magic wand unleashing the wrath of gods and killing half an army (or at least a few guys), sure, but a magic 9mm projectile that goes off three seconds after shouting hey you there watch out 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... heck, I'm pretty sure even I'd have a good chance of dodging that after a little timing training. Plus it gives so much time to just pull my bow and shoot that guy pointing his gun at me ... 

As the montain is about 6000m high there is no way any enemy beast can fly at that altitude. Tada, fight won, no man lost. If you don't like that, wind. Have the magicians of the city constantly swirl the air around the walls or above the city. If that's way to much force, anti-air-units are always problematic when shooting from the ground up, but high, well built towers with shooting holes combined with stone houses with spikes on the roofs will be hell for anyone flying low enough to drop into the city and anyone flying high won't be able to drop that far down. 

Thresholds: If those entities can only be seen at the exact border of visible light, we wouldn't notice them because they would be barely visible. If they led light of other wavelengths through their body, they would appear to us like a vague shadow in front of something else, the shadow however being so weak we wouldn't see it at all. The wavelengths each cone in the eye is able to perceive and to what extent can be seen for example at this picture: $URL$ Make the creatures be see through for everything but the far edge on one side so that only 0,(a few zeros)1% of light received by us contain information about them. Depending on how they behave on the rest of the non visible spectrum a (specific) camera would be able to see and photograph them (if you want that for your plot). Else make them out of something like glass for all wavelengths but even more see through (less visible), then we wouldn't notice them, but your ai could. 

Depending on the following story, you could go for some genetic engineering “simply“ (actually that would be really advanced stuff) editing out the perception of those entities somewhere late in the perception chain (the pattern of the entities triggering some kind of block). Maybe those entities have been around for a very long time and anchored this into the genome of all humans. We would then see them, maybe even subconsciously move around them but not know we saw them. Some people would have a genetic mutation allowing them to see those entities and consequently go to the mental hospital. 

No way. The mass that's in the way of the asteroid and gets compressed, vaporized and moved to the sites as a shockwave is too much. That's what killed the dinosaurs. Yours would need much more energy to get through there. Even if the asteroid was of a super heavy not yet discovered and somehow stable element and therefore super small for its mass, the energy needed to shoot through so much earth would be really bad. 

Well the same way it already is with humans. Are the lower and upper head called differently? Yes and no. Start talking about the head as one and then differentiate. Jaw, brain, etc. For the thorax you would have the same as with human legs. It's all thorax, but there are maybe 30 ribs, upper left and lower left kidney, etc. Just like in upper and lower legs that are both part of the leg, but inside there are femur, tibia, patella etc. If we had two identical knees per leg, they probably be either upper and lower or medial and cranial knees. If they were different they might have separate names, but in that case you have to invent those. So do it just as we already do. What's there twice gets named by relative position (left eye right eye) and everything that's new gets new names. Everything has a name for the whole thing and names for the parts. Medical terminology is very systematic and that system can normally be extended. For the animal parts take the animal terminology and extend that. 

Soap. Rich people had it, but it must have cost way more money than it does now, so just sell that, get gold and make the trip a few times. 

I forgot to charge my time machine and now I'm sitting in medieval Europe and need to recharge the batteries. Luckily, those are only car batteries and not the old plutonium powered ones. What's the easiest way to generate a sufficiently stable voltage/current output to charge my car battery? Assume I can talk to other people and buy what's widely accessible, but if I tell them too much they'll probably burn me as a witch. Bonus question, can I get some kV AC? 

So you have a person that can create frozen water out of thin air without using up energy effectively giving you an unlimited amount of potential energy. Sounds pretty straight forward to me - forget about using the cold, build some kind of icemill or let it melt and use the big waterfall. 

Breeding of natural triplets with fourlets and gradually selecting those with a long lifespan and better maternal survival. I guess queens would be bigger and stronger (endurance), so you would have to select those traits too. Some mutations which only occur by having generations of living humans would probably be necessary as I think not all necessary traits are contained in the current dna pool, so just selecting existing dna could fail. Other than that, fourlets or more probably need more milk, getting an extra pair of breasts could be really difficult. 

Let's assume you could get your lungs to turn co2 into oxygen. Why go through the trouble of getting the co2 from the atmosphere? Just design the lungs to convert the co2 you already have in you. That said, you could design a proteindriven transport through the lungs to overcome the objections about the pressure difference that impedes diffusion, but the atmosphere on Mars does simply not provide enough oxygen and the energy to turn co2 into o2 cannot come from a human only because we get energy by burning o2. 

Molecules have a very fragile balance of forces. By shrinking the atoms and the space between them (you have to shrink the space, else you'd have a human sized nothingness with mini atoms) you are moving them closer together. The effect would be way stronger electrical field forces between atoms (force increases with smaller radius). Basically, every molecule would break into it's mini atoms, leaving only a cloud of fastly dispersing mini atoms. (Probably even electrons, protons and neutrons, not even atoms). 

For big battles those disadvantages might be small compared to having easy to use weapons with good range and penetration, however the reason muskets were invented before rocket launchers is physics. Magic has other boundaries. Something way more destructive is possible. Why fire only one bullet if you can fit 100 into a box, aim at the general direction of the enemy forces and magically release all off them at once? Depending on the exact specification of the magic there is always a way to design a more powerful weapon, unless all the magic can do is imitate a little explosion like used in a musket. 

To add some historical facts, see for example this price list: $URL$ Soap isn't in there, but I think it might still provide a good source also for other answers. And searching for soap in the middle ages does provide sources saying it was a luxury good and used by rich people. No links there because I didn't find a single good source, but many secondary/tertiary/x-iary sources. 

Redundancy. Bigger than necessity organs due to evolutionary pressure to survive wounds and duplicated vascularisation with the possibility of closing many veins/arteries if severed. Wherever you hit, there will be another part of the organ able to take over the function and the blood drain will be minor because the tissue can survive a long time without blood while healing and the arteries are closed or almost closed. People can live with literally half their brain missing, make that per design and you can destroy half the head without problems. Bonus: to kill it you need to severe both vital arteries at one of the few points where they are near each other. 

($URL$ which means due to the different physical characteristics of the two mediums, the shockwave is reflected/weakend. The second medium (=shield medium) is created by having electric energy flow through a conductive path created by laser ionization (if I got that right) and heating the path. To create a shockwave by heating air or another liquid with a laser, you'd need a lot of power. So much power, that aiming the laser directly at your opponent/target would be way more effective. I'll leave the calculations to someone else. 

Same way the US “won“ the vietnam war, just with the enemy beeing even more powerful and better in hiding. Apart from a lot of air strikes against soft targets there's really no way to win against an enemy that is dispersed through a big terrain. So either you just bombard every city you can find and just ignore the hidden magicians, or you get them to actually defend those cities, then you can find them. but if they don't care and just go into hiding, laying traps and attacking your army from the distance, you don't win. 

That depends on how much scify you are willing to accept. I'm pretty certain it is not yet possible to do that, but as an earthquake is a wave, a wave with correlationfactor -1 would nullify that wave. Another way would be to reflect the wave by previously having built something that reflects earthquakes deep into the earth. Or, even further from possible, if you were able to liquidify a big amount of earth around the city but horizontally contained, the earthquake might be reflected at the boundary just as ultrasound waves are reflected on boundaries between air/water or bone/water. 

Another idea, stone houses, strong metal doors and little windows everywhere. Tunnels with strong doors between houses. Now even if a thousand man land inside the city, they can be easily slaughtered because they are still outside on the streets and can't get inside but can be shot at.
