I use a 23mm Continential GP4000S on the front. I love these tyres. They're super sticky and I've never had one slip out(!!) On the back I'm trialling 23mm Continental Gatorskins. They are cheaper and since the rear wears out so much faster than the front I'm hoping they'll still grip well but not cost me too much. So far I've been riding on it for about 3 weeks and have had no trouble. 

In Melbourne, we have a bike share scheme. You can buy helmets for $5 from various outlets and then return them for a refund of $3 (they are then cleaned and reused). Despite this, many people are saying that Australia's compulsory helmet laws are responsible for the lack of success of the bike sharing scheme. 

Replace your chain ring Replace the chain with a belt Replace your rear cog Cut the rear stay and insert a joiner (the most complicated task) 

The MASI bars have such a large drop, I'm not sure how well the brakes would work. I doubt I'll get a nice flat surface to grip the brakes while still being able to reach them from the drops. Has anyone tried this? Did it work? 

I am doing a 210km (130 mile) ride on Sunday. I assume it'd help me to taper but I'm not sure about the most effective method. How much should I ride in the last 3-4 days before the ride? My current plan is: 

I have a Surly Karate Monkey fork that has 160mm rotors. I'd like to upgrade to Clarks M2 brakes with 180mm rotors. How can I tell if those calipers/rotors will fit my fork? 

Lastly, is it possible that 9 speed chain (or less) is on that 10 speed cassette? If the chain is too wide, it would have the same symptoms (grabbing the ramps) 

Adjust the rear derailleur enough that it will stay in the lowest and highest gears, even if you have to help it a little with finger pressure on the derailleur arm. This may require adjusting the high and low limit screws. Adjust the front derailleur: Start by putting the rear in one of your middle gears. Then run the front through each chain-ring and make sure that it will smoothly move from ring to ring. Adjust as necessary. Set the rear to the highest (smallest) gear. Adjust the front so that it does not rub in any of your 2 or 3 chain-rings. Set the rear to the largest (biggest) gear and repeat the tuning process. In a 2 chain-ring setup, you have to make sure that the cross chain combinations (small-small and large-large) don't rub either. In a 3 ring setup, it's not always possible or necessary. If you have 1/2 clicks on the front shifter (most often in 2 ring setups), make sure to include them in the process. If you can't seem to get the front to adjust without rubbing, it's possible the height and/or twist of the derailleur clamp has changed. Check manufacturer's recommendations for position, if so. Adjust the rear derailleur: Put the front in smallest ring in front and tune the rear derailleur until you are satisfied with the speed and quietness of the shifting. If it's noisy or grinds, it's not right yet. Don't forget about the B-screw when tuning. If it's out of whack, then your shifting will be difficult or inconsistent, depending on which way it's out of adjustment. Next, move to your next biggest chain-ring and repeat the adjustment process of the rear derailleur. If you have 1/2 click front derailleur adjustments, you will need to include them in your tuning process. 

I've been having trouble with braking performance, particularly in the wet. The levers don't bottom out (as I'm careful to keep them adjusted), but even squeezing very hard the bike doesn't pull up very quickly. I should also mention that I've tried removing each lever and haven't noticed any difference (although it can be hard to compare different days and different conditions). I've had 3 different bike shops tell me that the problem is having both brake levers. They claim that it introduces too much flex into the system and braking power is reduced. I was very skeptical until all 3 people told me the same story independently. This doesn't make sense to me. The cable is not interrupted and using either lever doesn't seem to compromise the brake line in any way. When you use the bar end lever, the interrupter is closed and I can't see any flex in the lever. When using the interrupter lever I don't see how the bar end lever can be causing any flex either. Can anyone explain how having both levers would compromise performance? 

I don't think you have a problem here. Physiologically, your thighs are the engine room of your legs. They are designed for endurance and power and can keep working at a high output for extended periods of time. Your calves are more for short bursts of power, such as jumping or sprinting. They can't sustain high power output for any length of time. In distance cycling, your calves should be fairly passive. Attempting to work them harder will probably just result in fatigue and injuries. 

Well, it started raining today and I'm not much of a road cycling in the rain type of guy. Given that this weather will last for a few months, I was wondering what type of trainer should I get. I would like something that works with my Garmin Edge 520. My rear tire cannot fit the little rubber Garmin tracker thingy, so should I try to get an Ant+ trainer? Do those even exist? If not, what are some decent recommendations that won't break the bank? Are there certain features I should look for? 

On my single speed bike--a POS J Fixie Cafe CF from BikesDirect--has an issue with its back wheel. The wheel wobbles 1cm back and forth when pulled/pushed from side to side. The freewheel has been making noises since the day I got it. The noises are KLINK! KLONK! every time I pedal. I believe that this is due to a bit of a warp on the frame that makes the tire asymmetrical to the frame. Basically the left seat stay is slightly larger than the right one. (The lesson here is not to buy from BikesDirect, but go to a LBS.) Anyway, what can I do to fix this? Do I need to get a whole new back hub? Freewheel? 

On my single speed--a POS Bikes Direct bike--the rear wheel makes a clunking noise every time I pedal. I think it is coming from the freewheel and it's basically a CLINK! CLONK! noise that is driving me nuts. I should mention that the seat stay on the left side of the bike is slightly longer than on the right. Therefore the back is asymmetrical. The tire rides perfectly in the center of the rear dropouts and between the chain stays. However, the tire is a right aligned to the right seat stay. Here is a visual I sent to Bikes Direct to try to get them to fix it: And here are pictures of the bike from various angles. 

It's possible there's something stuck in your tyre that you can't find but when riding it is puncturing the tube. I've had the same situation and replacing the tyre completely fixed it. If you wanted to gather some evidence you can check if all the flats are happening in the same place relative to the tyre position. 

At work we have hooks attached to the wall so that we can hang our bikes from the front wheel. They're effectively the same as these: 

The bottom ring is used to provide tension against the bearings to stop the headset from wobbling around. It only needs to be hand tight, hence no spanner/tool attachments. The middle and top ring are tightened against each other, as a lock ring to prevent the bottom ring from loosening. The top ring can be tightened with any spanner of the right size. The middle ring requires a specialised spanner called a C-Spanner, a hook wrench or a hook spanner. It looks like the image below and is readily available from any bike shop or online store. Eg: Chain reaction sells one from Park tools 

I have a Sturmey Archer 3-speed hub on an ex-single speed. I got a flat on my way to work and couldn't ride any more. So I jumped on the train and took it to the bike shop near work (the shop who fitted the hub was too far from my work) to get them to fit a new tyre and tube. They've generally seemed pretty knowledgeable and competent when I've used them in the past. When I picked it up, they'd removed the changing cable and shaft (sorry, I don't know what this is called) that triggers the gear change from the hub and when I pointed it out they didn't even think that was a problem. So I assume they aren't exactly familiar with Sturmey Archer hubs. Unfortunately when they re-fitted the axle nuts they cross threaded it. So the nut was completely stripped and now I can't properly thread a new nut onto the axle, as the thread on the axle is also damaged. My first thought is to take it back and get them to fix it. But if the fix necessitates a new axle, I don't trust them to do the work. So I guess I should ask them to pay for me to return the hub to the shop I bought it from so they can repair it, but I doubt they'll agree to that. What is a reasonable expectation? How should I proceed from here? 

I went from a 23mm to 25mm tires on my '07 Tarmac Expert. The change was a blessing as I was able to do everything with more confidence. A part of it was for going from Gatorskins to Grand Prix 4000s II. Now that my Grand Prix are about to be worn out, I'm considering to going to 28mm versions. I know that my frame and brake callipers can clear the tire, however I'm not sure if I will gain any major benefits. I do a lot of climbin and try to stay off the flats. 

Right now, I have a Specialized Epic Expert '07 and a set of Bike Nashbar Rollers. It is pretty fun to roll and watch a movie, but it gets boring fast and never feels safe. I was looking into different trainers to do something different and actually work towards a goal which is getting better at hills. I have been looking at Tracx Vortex Smart T2180, Kinetic Fluid Trainer Rock 'N Roll Smart, and CycleOps FLUIDÂ² but it seems that there are so many nuances from each. I have a Garmin 520 and do not have a power meter on my bike. I understand that the Tracx is the most smart, but does not provide the road feel of a fluid trainer. The Kinetic is great for getting out of the saddle and getting those extra muscles working out, but it uses a non standard connection to broadcast stats. Is there something out there that would be quiet to use, provide the most road like feel, have the ability for smart functions that my Garmin 520 can use, and get me better for going uphill? 

Pretty sure that the MF series has the freewheel integrated with the cassette, so if you are going to a "pure" cassette, you will need to replace the freewheel and possibly the hub. You would need to replace the hub if you can't find a conversion to a non-integrated freewheel for your current hub. If the hub gets replaced, that could affect the disk as well. Does your current disk have an ISO 6 bolt pattern, or something else like Shimano's centerlock? If it's an ISO 6 bolt, you should not need a new disk with a new hub, assuming you get a hub with an ISO 6 bolt pattern. 

I think your derailleur is a bit out of adjustment and is "leaning" towards the lower gears. It's grabbing on the ramps of the lower gear as it goes by. Your B screw adjustment is a bit too far away from the cassette. I would try to get it within a link or link and half. It looks from the video that you are about 2-3 links away. See section 4 of this link: $URL$ 

Overall, you have a much better chance of getting a compatible upgrade if you stick with the same brand and similar technology (cable operated brakes vs. hydraulic for example) Note: As OP suggested, this answer was as generic as I could make it to fit other bike types/styles. 

They both have a lot of help on skills. In your case, I would look up "bunny hop" as that's what you are doing when hopping the curb. You probably won't hurt the rim as long as you have enough air in the tires. You can check the tire with a standard tire pressure gauge if you have the right valve, but if you don't have anything to air it up, it would probably be best to purchase a decent pump with a gauge built-in. You can find a bunch on Amazon. The proper pressure depends on a couple of things: 1) Tubes or Tubeless: If you are running tubes, you will need to stay above 30 PSI. If you are using tubeless, then you can run lower, like 25 PSI. 2) What you are doing with your bike: If you are just riding trails without jumps, curbs, rocks etc, you can get away with low pressures and ride comfortably. If you are "hucking" your bike off half-walls or 4' cliffs, you are going to need higher pressures. Good luck, have fun. Remember that tires, tubes and rims can be fixed, so don't sweat it too much. 

My LBS claims that Shimano's 10 speed groups are going away forever. They told me that if I don't upgrade to 11 speed that my next replacement will cost me an arm and a leg because 10 speed components will cost more due to a shortage. I've googled and checked here but found nothing to support their claim. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong place to get my news, so is Shimano discontinuing 10 speed road bike components, and should I just upgrade/get a new road bike to future proof my rides? Bike: 2007 Specialized Tarmac Expert Duo 

I have cleaned my chain and gears with rubbing alcohol and towels. Afterwards, I applied some chain lube on the chain. Now, when under a lot of torque, the chain skips and slips mid-cassette. Low gears and high gears seem to be unaffected. There were no tweaks made to the front or rear derailleurs. Could the previous gunk have kept the chain centered on the gear? Is there any chance that the rear derailleur got tweaked in the cleaning process somehow? I did clean the two gears on it. The bike is a 2007 Specialized Tarmac with about 4-5,000 miles on it. 

I have a 2007 Tarmac Expert Double with a Mavic Kysrium Equipe rim spoked to a Mavic Kysrium Equipe, 24 hole, Mavic QR rear hub. I recently upgraded to 28mm tires from 25mm and I had the rear wheel recently trued so rolls smoothly and clears all the stays. However, when I climb (out of seat) or make sharp turns, the tire rubs on the sides of the seat stay. When I press on my rear wheel to the left or right, it gives enough to rub against the brake pad as well as the sides of the seat stay. If I loosen the brakes the tire rubs a bit more on the right side than the left. Gooling around shows that my hub might be going bad given that I have put about 5-7k miles on the bike. Is this repairable? Does it make sense to buy a new wheel? Can I just replace the hub with a PowerTap and new spokes? How dangerous is it to ride with so much play with the wheel.
