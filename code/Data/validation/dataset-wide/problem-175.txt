Several answers have already talked about technology, but one thing that does not appear to have been considered yet is that technological development itself would require the existence of a language more specific than intuitively-understood "ideas, concepts, feelings" can be. This isn't mere conjecture, but a lesson of history, as Dijkstra points out: 

Note to time travelers: Beware of unintended consequences! Here's one rather significant problem that might occur: 

It's hard to see how "a rational and moderately intelligent precog" would be able to beat this strategy. 

This is a pretty ridiculous idea that reeks of sour grapes, to be honest. And it's more than a little ironic, since several years later some researchers with the benefit of hindsight discovered that many of the most important discoveries of Planck and Einstein would almost inevitably have been discovered approximately half a century earlier, if it hadn't been for James Maxwell's untimely death of cancer. (And just imagine what Planck and Einstein might have been able to discover then, if Maxwell's death hadn't held progress back for decades!) This isn't specifically a longevity example, but dead is dead. When great scientists die, they tend to take a lot with them, no matter what it is they specifically died from. 

He says that generally speaking, there are two basic ways to deal with magic in your writing: give it strong rules that the reader (not just the characters!) can understand, in which case it can be used as a neutral storytelling tool, or keep it "mystical" and deliberately loosely-defined, at the cost of not being able to be helpful without looking like a deus ex machina. (Deus ex magia?) He calls the first style "hard magic" and the second "soft magic", essentially a direct reference to "hard" and "soft" sci-fi, and points out that both styles can be quite successful, pointing to The Lord of the Rings as an exceptional example of soft magic. But because LOTR is soft magic, magic can't be used to resolve conflicts--though of course it can always make things worse for our protagonists. For example, when they have Gandalf hold off the Balrog with his magic, they end up losing his guidance for a major part of the story. (This is also why you can't "just have Gandalf fly everyone to the volcano on giant eagles;" it violates the convention and would ruin the story.) In "hard magic", on the other hand, if the reader knows the rules and is able to follow along, then he doesn't feel like the author's pulling a fast one when the protagonist uses magic to solve a problem, because it makes sense that he can do that. He uses Spider-Man as an example, even though his powers aren't technically magic, because it's an example that will be (presumably) familiar to all readers: because the audience knows that he can shoot webs, sense danger, cling to walls, and has superhuman strength and agility, "therefore, we’re not surprised when Spider-man shoots a web in a bad guy’s face. We’ve established that he can do that, and it makes sense to us when he does it. It is narratively a Hard Magic system, rather than a Soft Magic system." To give an idea of what not to do, one example (my example this time, not Sanderson's) of hard magic done badly is The Sword of Truth, in which the magic working by strict rules is basically an informed attribute: we're told, over and over and over in the story, that there are very strict, well-defined rules that magic works by, and several of the characters clearly have a very good understanding of those rules, but they are never explained to the audience, and so when, at the climax of several of the books, Richard resolves things by suddenly figuring out how to work some magical marvel, it ends up feeling like the author simply extracted the resolution from his nether regions. 

You could go the midichlorians route (sorry for prequel reference). Idea being that some ancient civilization genetically engineered people with this blood magic ability as you described. That civilization collapsed and after a new one was built in the millennia that followed, the the use of this baked in ability was outlawed. You could also go the route of an infectious nano-tech "disease" being responsible for the blood magic. In this case the source doesn't have to be an ancient galactic civilization. It could be something that the current galactic civilization spread by accident, or something that they encountered as part of their expansion and then inadvertently spread throughout the galaxy (despite their best efforts to contain it). 

I think you have a straight shot to industrialization if your biomagic artifacts can be made reliable. They don't have to be super strong, just better than an alternative way of making a part of some larger machine or system. Any modern machine is going to be some combination of mechanical, chemical, or electrical components. As long as it makes sense in your world to build machines that are some combination of mechanical, chemical, electrical, or magical artifact components then an industrial revolution makes perfect sense. The first caveat you already took care of: magic can't be so strong that it makes no sense to industrialize. The second caveat is the reliability of artifacts: either it's so bad that a mundane industrial revolution takes place (because why should common people count on things that frequently explode by accident?), or else improvements in artifact design spark a magi-tech industrial revolution. 

To lose the knowledge of how to make stuff? About a generation. But to have the concepts involved become mythologized? That generally takes around 3 centuries. 

From Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series: The heroine, Vin, was fighting a warrior who had Atium, which gave him the magical power to see her attacks before she made them, and to react to them accordingly. It was believed that the only counter to the precognition of a warrior with Atium was to have Atium yourself, but Vin had used all of hers. But then she realized she could: 

Because the purpose of language is communication, in theory, what would be needed for a global language to arise is a global communication system. In practice... that's exactly what we're seeing. Look at how rapidly English is becoming the lingua franca of the Internet ever since the rise of the World Wide Web. It's already accomplished more, in a few short decades, than the combined resources of colonizing empires, missionaries, and traveling ESL teaching programs have in centuries. 

This is not exactly the same as the conditions in Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive series, but the principle is similar enough: every few days a highstorm (a massive hurricane powered by magic that keeps it from immediately petering out when it makes landfall) blows across the continent, always from east to west. Cities are built in laits, which are natural shelters afforded on the leeward side of cliffs and other large rock formations. This provides a great deal of protection from highstorms, and it would likewise provide protection for your wind-land cities. The really tricky thing here isn't the cities, though; it's travel between them. If the wind never lets up, it's very difficult to safely go outside of sheltered areas! 

So normal everyday humans use bioreactors called mitochondria to generate energy. They literally burn fuel, reacting fats and sugars with oxygen and use the heat generated to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The energy from burning food is stored in the transition from ADP to ATP. ATP goes where it's needed and the energy is released by converting back to ADP. I recall from biology that ADP is like a spring or grip crusher, and the addition of an additional phosphate group twists the molecule into a high energy configuration - like compressing a spring and locking it. Pop the lock and let it decompress to release the energy. I'm thinking that that's more analogy than how it physically works, however, one of the answers on quora did mention that the ATPase moves like a water wheel when the extra phosphate group is added or removed. So how to mess with this? Go from chemical mitochondria to nuclear powered ones and just flood the body with ADP/ATP to handle the increased energy production and use. You'd never get tired - like a hyperactive kid in the throes of an intense sugar rush, but you might start running into issues of over heating or parts of the body wearing out due to overuse since they aren't used to having and endless supply of energy. So if you start making additional mods to handle those issues, might as well take it one step further and replace the ADP/ATP with a different molecule that can store much more energy. This will help with moving more energy more quickly for, say, explosive movements. 

The author here is speaking of the "Galileo was persecuted for believing that the Earth goes around the Sun" myth, (the truth is far more complicated, and far more interesting!), but the point raised here has plenty of other applications. For example, we've all heard the idea that Columbus proved that the world is round. Not only is this so wrong that it falls apart under the simplest possible examination--take a look at a globe sometime and see if you can explain how sailing from Spain west to the Caribbean and then back east to Spain will prove that--he actually wasn't trying to. Everyone knew the world was round already, sailors most of all! (The visual phenomenon of a ship disappearing at the horizon from the bottom up, exactly as it would when moving along a curved surface, has been known since ancient times.) What Columbus tried to prove is that the world was a lot smaller than everyone knew it was--and they were essentially right about the size of the world, BTW--such that if you set out west from Europe, you could reach Asia before running out of provisions. He was wrong about that, and if there hadn't been more unexpected land in the way, he and his crew would have all died at sea. But in the early 19th century--about 300 years after his fateful voyage--the idea arose, promulgated by Washington Irving, that Columbus was some paragon of Reason, proving to the benighted people of his day that the world was not actually flat as everyone believed, and the myth has stuck around in the popular consciousness ever since. Therefore, by long historical precedent, if your society reaches a state where knowledge of modern concepts turns into myth, it's likely to take about 300 years. 

I think some sort of "natural" or "organic" computer is the way to go. Maybe there is an organism that naturally forms significant colonies of single cells, and has evolved to act as a neural network to make simple decisions and react to stimuli collectively. Humans can cultivate larger-than-natural colonies and then train them (the way a machine-learning algorithm trains a virtual neural network) to react to various types of electrical inputs. Then its just a matter of plugging the right types of analog inputs into the organic neural network, and then plugging the outputs into mechanical arms, legs, etc. 

Honor Some things are more important than survival, and chief among these is honor. If someone insults your 10,000 year-old ancestral name, encroaches upon your ancient lands, or speaks ill of your creator, it cannot be allowed to stand. You did not seek this fight, but you will pursue it with grim determination, and show the world that you will tolerate no disrespect. Your race wasn't created to merely survive. They were created to be a great power in the world, which means a willingness to pick up arms and fight when duty calls. Better to burn bright for a while than to burn dimly forever. 

Robots with powerful but delicate sensors, advanced locomotive capabilities, and independent AI are extremely expensive and difficult to maintain. Expensive enough that even though they might be technically possible, nobody makes them. The space engineers worked on a few prototypes of such a robot, but ultimately abandoned the project for other priorities. Having an actual person go out and check on it turns out to be the most practical option. 

I think the answer is "of course." What that looks like is somewhat up to you. So an example that came to mind is the character Tali from one of the Mass Effect games - this is from memory and it's been a while... but the gist was that her species was kicked off their homeworld by AI that they'd created and lived in space for generations. As a whole species their immune systems eventually become compromised and they can't interact with any other race without wearing a protective suit. That's sort of interesting and addresses the issue of races that might be poisonous to one another, but doesn't have a huge impact in terms of how they might interact. To be perfectly fair humans generally wear a limited protective suit (clothes) as a rule when interacting with others and that doesn't seem to limit things much. The idea of the invisible aliens is really fun, but probably still falls under the same sort of reasoning. You would be able to know that there was intelligence based on the fact that stuff that doesn't seem to be naturally occurring is happening - like seeing a spaceship, the land (or a star or a nebula) being worked into the equivalent of a city, or one of your buds taking a predator laser to the chest. For interaction and communication you'd need to work out some system where you are both manipulating something that you both can see, using special sensors or using some sort of indicator to say "I'm here" like the invisible man wearing visible glasses. 

Mages are like feudal knights. They are experts at what they do and are devoted to their lord/king/queen. This arrangement is mutually beneficial - mages are given the time and resources to devote themselves to their craft, and the rulers gain powerful allies. The rulers themselves are rarely mages, because the dedication required conflicts with the responsibilities of ruling. However, it is common for the non-inheriting children of important families to study magic, and they become important contributors to the family's strength. Sufficiently intelligent and studious people of lower rank can rise in status by becoming mages - the usual route for this is to seek patronage from an important family, and then repay them with service. Self-taught prodigies are extremely rare. Mages who betray their patron are seen as treacherous and ungrateful. Eventually, a "commoner" mage can gain their own lands and start their own noble house, so they are rarely interested in bringing the whole feudal system toppling down. 

Here's how I think it would have to work: 1) Your primary income is from a protection racket. Basically, what you do is attack enough people to make your threat clear, then go around and collect money from them so you leave them alone. This is a more sustainable, lower-risk way to make money from piracy. 2) In addition to this, you would exploit rivalries between nations. You would collect a bounty from nation X for messing with nation Y, basically acting as privateers/mercenaries. All of the above would still probably not be enough to be the majority of economic activity. It could, however, be an important part of a larger economy and the primary source of state revenue.
