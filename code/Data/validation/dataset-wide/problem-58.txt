It depends what it is made of. There is "a new class of magnesium-alloy syntactic foam that always floats on water ... one of the strongest metals for its weight ever developed." $URL$ If we can find out the density of that material we can calculate the size for the weapon by knowing how heavy it could plausibly be. UPDATE - Reading further, I see that the density is about the same as that of water, i.e. 1kg/m3. There is an article here (thearma.org) about the weights of actual medieval swords. They were lighter than some people suppose. It turns out that the calculation is incredibly easy. Steel is about 8 times the density of water. If we assume that traditional swords are made of steel then all we have to do is find an actual length for a steel sword and (in order to keep everything in the same proportion) multiply it by the cube root of 8 (i.e. 2). So, by reading that article I see that a very large usable steel sword would be at most 6 feet long. Therefore our alloy sword could be 12 feet long. It would look something like this. 

The bartender weighs it and says, "Yes sir!" Scenario 2. I walk into a bar in a gold-mining community.

In a pre-industrial world where magic is thriving, it is possible for a mage to alter the size of a creature (including other humans). Thus a duck could be made horse-sized. It would have all the normal features of the original duck but its mean density would remain the same. Thus it would be very unlikely to be able to fly. Similarly a horse could be made duck-sized. It too might have problems, for instance being chased by a cat. There are magical limits to the transformations. Creatures can be no smaller than 1/100 of their natural size and no bigger than 100 times their natural size. However I am interested in the physical limitations. Most wizards have a purpose for the transformation, they don't usually wish to kill the animal by making it unfeasibly large or small. Questions Animals are physically suited to their natural sizes - their musculature and skeleton etc. are 'just right' What level of transformation is likely to produce viable creatures? I am primarily interested in survival. The animal needs to be able to survive long-term in its altered state in terms of avoiding danger and acquiring water and food etc. How will the change affect a creature's mobility? What other implications may limit what mages can sensibly do in this respect? Notes 

We are allowed to manipulate the environment. The victim is led along a narrow walkway in semi-darkness. A scary picture appears suddenly to one side. At that point on the walkway at the opposite side there is a deep pit that is concealed in the darkness. The victim screams, steps sideways and falls into the pit. The base of the pit can contain whatever is needed for their demise. 

Some societies in our current world have strong beliefs about ghosts and spirits. This affects their architecture, e.g. 

Note: The spirits are the greyed-in circles. The walls are the black lines. If the spirits can touch in two places they can hold on. A green tick means that the spirit can hold on to the surfaces. A red cross means that the spirit cannot hold on. Movement At night the ghosts leave the corners and move around the building. Their maximum speed is about walking speed of a human but like most ghosts they can move through walls. They mainly operate like poltergeists. What they can move depends on their size. A 1cm ghost could knock an empty teacup over. A 5cm ghost could hide your TV remote or your keys. A 30cm ghost can open doors, pull your bedding off or pull drawers out and spill the contents. A 1m ghost is the most dangerous. It can knock large furniture over, shake your bed, pull you out of bed while you are asleep - even levitate you. All ghosts can do a sort of Vulcan mind-meld while you are asleep. The small to medium ones can give you nightmares. The larger ones can employ phenomena such as temporarily possessing you as in the Exorcist movie. Interaction with solid objects Ghosts, like poltergeists, can choose to interact with solid matter. When sleeping, they can hold onto surfaces. During the night they move around and grip things with their pseudopods. They can drift through solid walls but they cannot simultaneously interact with solids and drift through them. Therefore they have to slingshot themselves through solid objects. The reason that they must roost somewhere during the day is that they are not affected by gravity. They would simply drift off into space if they didn't hold onto something. Preference Ghosts like to congregate near people. They prefer an inhabited house to an uninhabited one. However if they cannot find somewhere to hide near people, they have to go further afield in order to find a daytime sleeping place. 

Not infinite but become dictator of a country. Then proceed to tax everyone out of existence whilst you build a palace and live in luxury. Make sure you control all news media. Have a private helicopter waiting in case of revolution. 

A couple of black holes should it. One on either side and their gravity pulls the water apart. You don't specify the direction of the parting. A downburst is a strong ground-level wind system that emanates from a single source above and blows radially, that is, in a straight line in all directions, from the point of contact at ground level. This would make a circular island that was lower than the water around it. Along an extended weather front, the downburst could be more linear, forming an inverted causeway. 

In the Terminator movies, time travellers arrive naked and then steal clothes and other items from the locals. In my society this is also true. However they can carry some things internally in the same way that drug smugglers do. There is only so much that they can carry. When they arrive, they have to unload the cargo via bowel movements so they can't carry anything sharp or excessively bulky. Time travel is a closely guarded secret and the exclusive property of a guild. Members of the guild become rich by trading with people in other times. Questions 

Ice calving, also known as glacier calving or iceberg calving, is the breaking off of chunks of ice at the edge of a glacier ... Calving of glaciers is often accompanied by a loud cracking or booming sound before blocks of ice up to 60 metres (200 ft) high break loose and crash into the water. The entry of the ice into the water causes large, and often hazardous waves. The waves formed in locations like Johns Hopkins Glacier can be so large that boats cannot approach closer than 3 kilometres (1.9 mi). The above is from the Wikipedia entry on Ice Calving.
