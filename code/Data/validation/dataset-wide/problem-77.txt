Evolution doesn't happen with a goal or planned, it is a random process. Every time the DNA of any living thing is recreated, when cells split etc. there is a small chance that errors happen. With a even smaller chance, this errors have effects. Reasons why the DNA mutates are numerous: Radiation, Toxines, Viruses, ... If you define a perfect world as a world where such mutations don't happen, then there won't be any evolution. If you say in your perfect world such errors happen, then there will be evolution. As I said, evolution is a random process. You can't sit in front of your PC and decide "hell yeah, I am going to evolve today!" and suddenly you have three arms. Evolution works this way: 

So for example, let's say there are different mutations that change the height to which the plant will grow. We have our "normal" plant A that is on your planet. Suddenly, two random mutations appear in two different plants. One, A+ will grow to 1.5 times the normal size. The other, A- will grow to 0.5 times the size. As we know, plants mate and mix up their genes. So if two plants create a seed, we now say the resulting plant will have the height of both averaged. After some generations, there will be plants in all sizes from 0.5 to 1.5. But now think about this: All this plants need sunlight. But the larger plants will get more sunlight, while the smaller ones will stay in the shadow of the large plants. So the larger plants get more energy from the sun to grow even larger and "steal" more sunlight from the smaller plants. Also they can generate more blossoms and thus generate even more large plants stealing the light from the smaller ones. So after some time, there probably won't be any smaller plants left and all plants "evolved" to be larger. But maybe some plant has another mutation, that changes the colour of its blossoms. In this world, there is no difference at all between this two colours, so after some time there will be plants with both colours on the planet. Also I don't see how a plant could lose its evolution capacity. If you say your plant is perfect adapted, there can still be changes which make no difference like the different blossom colours. Even ignoring that, there will always be plants with mutations. If they are less adapted, they will just stop existing after some time, but at any given time there will be mutated plants on the planet. 

Using ammonia as a solvent would work, though if you want it to be pure ammonia, you'll have to keep your aliens quite cold, as it boils at -33Â°C. Aqueous ammonia solutions would work, but that does not seem to be what you're after. Ammonia isn't as broadly useful a solvent as water, but it does allow for lots of interesting chemistry to occur, including things like relatively stable solutions of solvated electrons, which are quite unstable in aqueous systems. Lots of biological reactions will produce water, so an anhydrous alien will need a way to excrete the water just as we have a way to excrete ammonia. Maybe your alien could excrete crystals of glycerol or urinate an alcohol or something like that. In any case, ammonia is a much better choice than a hydrocarbon. Breathing hydrogen is a bit more problematic. The purpose of breathing oxygen is that we can break C-H bonds and combine oxygen with both carbon and hydrogen atoms to release energy in the metabolism of organic molecules. Oxygen is highly reactive stuff; we just don't realize it because we've evolved to walk around at the bottom of an ocean of it. If we breathed hydrogen instead, it would be far less reactive. Hydrogen will readily react with lots of things, but it typically doesn't release huge amounts of energy in the process. One idea might be to have your aliens run a biological version of the Sabatier process. The reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures, though it would never actually occur without catalysis at liquid ammonia temperatures. This would give them a means of producing some basic metabolic building blocks from materials that are common in the universe as well as provide a reason for them to breathe hydrogen in the first place. 

Building the boat would have required a substantial amount of time. Some creationist types have put construction time at between 70 and 120 years. Recall that Noah and co. were supposed to have lived for several hundred years. There are massive logistical problems with building the biggest wooden vessel ever constructed in ancient Iraq, not the least of which is supplies. The sheer amount of wood required to build the vessel is enormous - it would have had to have been imported to the area from elsewhere. Most of the vertebrate species on Earth are quite small. For instance, the vast majority of the 6000 amphibian species would, if placed in containers roughly the size and shape of 10 gallon aquariums, fill a volume of about 120'x15'x8' (40 3' wide shelves that are 15' wide and 8' high, crammed full of aquariums with just enough space between shelves to walk. If you could just throw all the frogs in a bucket together, then you can collapse this down substantially, of course. All but a few of the amphibians would fit into such a container easily.The other groups of vertebrates are similar, with most members fitting comfortably in a breadbox sized volume, but there are as many as a thousand species that need considerably more room. It's also difficult to count how many species there really are. For instance, the number of extant Equus species (horses and friends) is anywhere from 7 to 24, depending on how you count them. Monitor lizards dragons, the big cats, anacondas, pachyderms, and large primates are all problematic in this regard, and there's no good way to count them up by volume. If we give each of them a goat-sized stall (5'x8') and assume that the ones that are a little smaller will average out with the ones that are a little bigger, then considering all of the larger animals on the planet, you're looking at something like 40,000 square feet of floor space. With enough room to walk between stalls for feeding, the big animals would fill up about one and a third entire floors of the biblical ark. The non-fish vertebrates would have fit into the ark, barely.I initially thought that packing sufficient food for the trip would be problematic, but it is less so than I originally thought. The elephants would eat about 500 pounds of high quality food per day. The voyage was roughly a year long (a bit more if you add up all of the days) so that is roughly 70 tons of elephant food alone, another 70 cubic meters of space (assuming the food is packed extremely efficiently.) Food for a similar duration of the trip for all of the other animals would be problematic to collect, and for herbivores, the food will take up a substantial amount of space as well, though there is no reason you couldn't put that food in the enclosure with the animals. Gaining access to sufficient quantities of fresh water for all of the animals would be a challenge though. Now, could you cram all of the animals into smaller enclosures and have plenty of room? Of course you could, and if we're assuming divine intervention to deal with all of their behavior for the collection and trip, it might be appropriate to do so. In any case, the biblical dimensions, perhaps with some additional height added so that we can get three floors into it if needed, should be sufficient to hold the vertebrates and a year's worth of food. Using your rules, it would take a very, very long time and be exceedingly difficult. Any voyage would have been done by sea or caravan overland, and the logistics of moving that many animals to Iraq are daunting at best. Basically you'd have to build arks just to collect the animals to go on the ark. That is going to take years itself.The bigger problem is speciation. New species arise at a rate of roughly 1-3 per million per year. We'd expect as many as one new vertebrate species each decade. Columbus's trip took about a year, with essentially no overland travel involved. Magellan's crew got back after 3 years, again without significant overland travel. Lewis and Clark took 2 years to walk a single line across the continental US. Each new species that arose would set Noah back by years, and the time required simply to sail to every single required landmass on Earth would be astounding. I honestly don't know how to put a number to it. You also introduce the horrible logistics of caring for enormous numbers of animals while you wait for Ham to get back with the latest variety of leopard frog or whatnot.This amount of time is entirely dependent on the level of magic we're willing to accept. If the animals are not cooperative, then the collection will take forever due to speciation. If the animals are super cooperative, traveling to easy to reach ports for collection, then it might just be possible over the course of several decades or centuries. 

Risk reduction? In many fictional universes space is dangerous and filled with pirates, aliens and alien pirates that want your valuable cargo. If all the cargo is stuffed into a single huge spaceship and it is stolen or destroyed then it's a huge financial loss. If the cargo is distributed among relatively inexpensive independent contractors (and you don't have to pay their life insurance premiums) then perhaps it makes economic sense to use smaller ships since there's a better chance that at least some of the cargo gets to its intended destination. 

Basically, the aliens need to incorporate Earth into their sphere of control to gain social networking points and keep their rivals from claiming those points instead. First alien civilization to gain 100 "planet points" gets a gold badge. Basically, this is 

In David Brin's Uplift War science fiction series, there is a lot of value in species that are on the brink of intelligence on an evolutionary scale. Dolphins, Chimpanzees, etc. have potential for sentience and claiming them as client species is valuable to the alien civilization as a whole. Claiming Earth as a client planet would give the alien civilization access to the genetic diversity of this planet. Keeping humans in line is important to ensure we don't drive any potentially valuable species to extinction. 

In a magical world (or a world with magic-like effects) perhaps there's a "Inverse Ninja Law" in effect. In this world, the "magical" power of a particular species is constant BUT the with normal, exponential biological growth the "magic" gets spread thinner and thinner among the living individuals. The individual creature, having had children, has a biological imperative to give advantage to its offspring. It goes out into the world to be eaten so that it's magical essence can be distributed among its children. Why doesn't it just commit suicide? Because of magical reasons. 

The triassic period ended with the (appropriately named) end-Triassic extinction which resulted in the extinction of approximately 76% of all marine and terrestrial species. So it's possibly that your time travelers didn't make it past that barrier at all. However, one theory is that this period of extinction was not a sudden event but a result of climate change due to volcanism from the rift of the continent of Pangea over 40,000 to 620,000 years. Humans are nothing if not adaptable so chances are we would survive. So, you have humans in a period where most species are under extreme pressure from climate change AND under extreme pressure from a new apex predator (us). I would imagine that the Triassic period would begin with far less genetic diversity than it did. This, of course, has huge ramifications on which species evolve. For example, the first mammals evolved in the late Triassic period. Would a dominate human technological society accidentally drive them to extinction as well? The cascading effect of that over the next 200 million years would be unimaginable. My answer to the question: when the "aliens" invasion arrives in the modern era humansâassuming we still existâwould have 200 million years of evolution on a world where many common creatures (including, possibly, the entire class of Mammalia) may have never even evolved. Earth would be, I think, totally unrecognizable. 

As others have said, a solid platform made of light is completely unrealistic. However, it is entirely possible for light to exert a force on an object and hold it up, though the force required to support a human's mass against Earth's gravity would require a truly ferocious amount of light. Using some serious estimation, a 1km square reflective sail in orbit around the Sun at Earth's orbital radius would experience a maximum of about 8 newtons of force from the sunlight hitting it. Cutting that down to an average foot size, about 0.03 square meters, you're looking at about 0.5 micronewtons of force across both feet. The force required to support an adult woman of Chell's approximate mass is 600-700N. So if her shoes were highly reflective, the platform would have to shine over one billion times brighter than the Sun in order to support her weight. That translates to well over a trillion watts per square meter. I could be way off on this, but if my math is right, that corresponds to the radiation emitted by something that is 160,000Â°C (290,000Â°F), assuming all of the light is emitted under her shoes at the time her feet apply pressure. If you're writing a story, this could make for a really interesting failure mode... 

The entirety of this problem is related to egg laying and early development of chicks, so a few things need to happen: 

My understanding of your rules: A. Transport two of every (non-fish) vertebrate to Iraq. B. Put them on a boat that would fit them all. C. Do this using only historically reasonable technology, with no additional divine intervention. Rule C is important, because once we allow magic, what's the point in asking the question? Any omnipotent deity who really cared could have poofed the boat and animals into existence instantly and skipped the entire silly story. I will, however, assume that the animals are willing participants in this process though - that once Noah reaches their range, he won't have to find and trap them. If not, I'm fairly certain that the process couldn't be completed by Noah and his family ever. 

Penguins (or similar, but penguins make the most sense) need to be born with adult feathers and/or blubber layers so that the chicks can survive in the water. Even tropical ocean temperatures are dangerous to warm blooded animals who are exposed and unprotected for long periods of time. As an alternative, the penguins' core body temperature could drop by 20Â°C or so and the bird could be restricted to the tropics, but that seems a bit much. The whale route is a possibility here as well, with both babies and adults losing their feathers entirely, but penguins rely heavily on their feathers creating an insulating layer between the water and their skin. The bird must evolve live birth. Shelled eggs have undergone massive amounts of evolution to function on dry land; getting a shelled egg to work underwater again would not be trivial. All sea dwelling members of formerly land-based vertebrates either give birth to live young (cetaceans, manatees, and some sea snakes) or are forced to return to land to lay eggs/have babies unsuited for ocean life (sea turtles, crocodilians, the rest of the sea snakes, flighted sea birds, penguins, and pinnipeds.) It's a lot easier to have the egg hatch out internally (or more realistically, fail to form/lay normally and continue developing without a shell internally.) For deeper diving penguins (not at all a necessity for permanent life in the water, just ask the boto) you would need greater lung capacity and perhaps larger overall size, though king penguins can already get down to 300m or so, which is comparable to dolphins. The animal's blood would also have to be vastly enriched in its oxygen carrying capacity. True deep divers like sperm whales have adaptations to prevent the bends as well as lungs that absolutely do collapse under pressure. Trying to design a biological pressure vessel that wouldn't collapse is probably a bad plan. Underwater communication - Penguins may already do this. Early tests of little penguins at the Perth Zoo were not positive, but the zoo is not a natural environment. Further, it is not at all unreasonable for penguins to evolve underwater communication. They're extremely vocal above water. Dolphin/whale blowholes are for breathing, not for vocalization. They vocalize using "lips" that are located internally, near their blowholes, but they don't blow out air when they vocalize, so you could put the nostrils/air inlet wherever you like. As far as the nostrils moving up the head for breathing purposes, that's not that big a stretch, though behind-the-head whale nostrils are pretty impressive. Regarding prey: There is something to eat at most any reasonable depth you might want your bird to inhabit. It would require a change of diet, but an unexploited food source is an enormous evolutionary driver.
