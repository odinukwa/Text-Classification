You have the right idea. As the Visuddhimagga states, full samadhi does not provide insight but upacara samadhi (another name for insight meditation or vipassana meditation) does provide insight into personal emotional problems and into how the mind actually works. Modern emotional problems are related to an abusive or dysfunctional family background and manifest as problems with self-love and finding love in adult life. The Buddha did not deal with or talk about this kind of suffering or how it is best treated. Although I practiced traditional mindfulness meditation for over 50 years, I recommend that you try a mindfulness center that offers both MBSR and psychotherapy. You can read my books to get a more Buddhist perspective. But I must warn you, Buddhist psychology is very difficult to understand. My name is Ronald Cowen. 

I suspect you are a beautiful woman. If so, you are referring to a consciousness that many beautiful women have. But, before you view this as bad of you, you should view an interview on YouTube of the Dalai Lama by Piers Morgan. In this interview, Morgan asked the Dalai Lama, “Do you ever feel temptation when you see a woman?” The Dalai Lama’s reply, “Oh yes. Sometimes I say, ‘this is very nice.’ But then thinking ‘too much problem.’” My suggestion is that, if the Dalai Lama finds a beautiful woman attractive, then there must be something good about it, even if it is a problem for him. The reality is that, if you are conscious of being beautiful, then it is due to the fact that people see you as beautiful and they experience beauty as a good thing. Hence, your consciousness of being beautiful is not a delusion and your sense of worth is based upon a worth experienced by others. Of course, this is a problem for you because your beauty is not you. This is not a problem with identification, but a problem with a misleading process of social perception. Pride and shame are understandable consequences. In answer to your question, do not try to “lose identification” with your body, instead, understand the social process and how it can be confusing or complicated for someone, you in particular. 

Kashmiri Shaivism is a sect of Hinduism that used to be popular in the Kashmir region of India. Now this excerpt from the Paramarthasara Vivriti, a work by the 11th century Kashmiri Shaivite philosopher Yogaraja, discusses the delusion that arises from confusing that which is Self from that which is not Self: 

The part in bold caught my attention because I found it interesting that a Hindu philosopher would praise Buddhist thought in this way. But my question is, what Buddhist text is this quote from? I don't have Yogaraja's Paramarthasara Vivriti in Sanskrit, so I can't give the exact Sanskrit quote. By the way, for the Hindus in the audience, I should mention that Yogaraja's work is a commentary on Abhinavagupta's Paramarthasara, which is in turn a reworking of Adisesha's Paramarthasara. 

My question is, have any Buddhist thinkers responded to this critique of Buddhism? Note that I don't want answerers to try responding to the critique themselves (which might lead to too much speculation and arguments). I'm just interested in whether any published works have responded to it. By the way, the aphorisms of the Brahma Sutras are somewhat cryptic, so their meaning and justification are usually understood with the help of commentaries, like this one and this one. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You in Advance. EDIT: Here is a book about the Brahma Sutras' critique of the Vedanta school. 

From the point of view of Theravadin Buddhism and the requirements for the achieving the full benefits from the practice of mindfulness meditation, both demotivation and nihilism would be viewed as hindrances to gaining upacara samadhi, an objective, calm, undistracted, and focused state of mind that is conducive to psychological insight (which, in turn, is required to overcome suffering). Nihilism, as you define it, is most certainly not “intimately tied with Buddhism,” except in the sense that Buddhism explicitly denies its truth. Question: “for someone lacking craving, what is there to be done in life?” Answer: He or she must heal the catatonic state that causes such wide-ranging indifference. There has to be some profoundly tragic event or trauma, perhaps in early childhood, that would cause such a profound withdrawal from reality. The practice of meditation while in such a state may only deepen the withdrawal. In other words, its seems to me that you are suffering from a mental disorder. Traditional Buddhism does not deal well with mental disorders. Traditional Buddhist teachers simply lack the expertise needed to treat them. However, there are mindfulness centers that offer MBSR and psychotherapy that may meet your needs. Otherwise, I recommend to find a fully qualified psychotherapist or psychiatrist to diagnose your situation and provide relevant treatment. There is no doubt in my mind that you are in a profound state of suffering even though you may not be feeling much pain. I truly hope that you will find the loving and wise help you need. 

What are the psychological and metaphorical interpretations of the 6 realms and why are they significant to some Buddhists but not others? 

What is the purpose or significance of devotion in Buddhism? Are there differences in acts of devotion in Mahayana and Theravada tradition? 

To what extent does Buddhism state we have free will and moral responsibility for our actions? Does Karma mean our future is predestined? 

What would be considered a religious experience in Buddhism in the same way,for example, Moses' experience with the burning bush of God? Would it be the Buddha's enlightenment itself or a bodhisattva's interaction with Buddha? 

Do any scriptures discuss the importance of intention? Why is intention rather than action important?

Nichiren Buddhism differs from other schools of Buddhism in focusing on this world, and in its view that it is the only correct tradition. It also emphasises the importance of individuals taking responsibility for improving themselves. Although it can be seen as a highly self-focused religion, followers of Nichiren Buddhism believe that individual empowerment and inner transformation contribute, in turn, to a better and more peaceful world. Beliefs: instant enlightenment Instant enlightenment is one of the key elements of Nichiren Buddhism. It teaches that enlightenment is available to everybody. One writer has encapsulated this idea as a "shortcut to salvation". The essence of enlightenment is opening a person's innate Buddha-nature in this world. Nichiren, the founder, came to believe that he was living in a degraded age, an age of mappo (very similar to the English term "end times") where Buddha's teachings were misinterpreted and as a consequence many bad things were happening. Nichiren followed the Lotus Sutra in his teaching that all living beings could attain enlightenment on earth and could do this through chanting and 'human revolution'. Nichiren emphasised the Lotus Sutra to the extent that he taught that it was the only way that could lead to true Buddhahood, and create a truly good world. He taught that other Buddhist practices no longer provided a road to enlightenment, and that it was the neglect of the Lotus Sutra that was responsible for the evils of his time; including such things as earthquakes. Nichiren was not just a scripture scholar, he was an activist. Having worked out what was wrong with contemporary Buddhism he did something about it. He engaged in shakubuku. This Japanese word means "to break and subdue". The main practice of Nichiren Buddhists is chanting, primarily the mantra Nam Myoho Renge Kyo which means 'I devote my life to the law itself'. Chanters repeat this mantra to enter more deeply into the spiritual tradition of the Lotus Sutra. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo is both the heart and title of the Lotus Sutra, which teaches the enlightenment of all living beings. Believers also recite sections of the Lotus Sutra as part of their daily practice. The chant is performed in front of a scroll called the Gohonzon. Chanting is usually performed for about 30 minutes night and morning and is believed to bring about changes in a person's life and reverse bad karma. Nichiren Buddhists specifically believe that everyone can change their destiny and bring about the effects they desire. Followers are encouraged to write their personal goals down on a piece of paper and have it in front of them while chanting. The aim of the practice is to establish high states of self-development. As Yukio Matsudo writes, it "works as a regular and constant inspiration to manifest the qualities of the Buddha in one's daily life." Chanting versus prayer: This chanting tradition is very different to the tradition of chanted prayer in many other religions. Those who practice it believe that the chant is "an influence at work in the metaphysical economy" and actually changes the force and action of karma. 

First of all, there are many “Buddhist lenses.” And, beyond any doubt, “learned helplessness” is a profound state of suffering that is extremely difficult to deal with. My heart goes out to you! It is painful for me to understand the nature of your situation. For someone to recommend you somehow “accept” this condition is either ignorant of its true nature or pathologically indifferent. The notion that the wish to overcome suffering is a form of craving is not a Buddhist teaching! Learned helplessness always has a long a deep history. I strongly suggest you find a good psychotherapist who, at the very least, knows what learned helplessness really is and can therefore help you extract yourself from it. I wish you well and hope that you will find someone who actually understands you and provides with the love and good advice you obviously need! 

In my experience with studying the Theravadin Abhidhamma, if found that the 52 cetasikas did not make much sense until I studied the citta-vithi (thought process). Then it made more sense how or why one citta (moment of consciousness) is different from another in terms of the cetasikas. 

Be wary of the concept of guru and especially the person who claims to be one. Extraordinary teachers are rare and impossible to find. It is better to find a traditional and experienced teacher who makes no special claims. You may even consider a modern meditation center that offers MBSR, MBCT, and psychotherapy that has a large membership. Progress in meditation is largely psychological.
