Bass love cover and submerged tree and similar. So if you can find a spot like that on your pond you are wanting to fish then you're set. It may help to ask around although people don't like to give up their spots. It also helps to take pictures at different times of the year when the lake is low or high, this will help you to know what is below. As far as using the worm rig it takes a bit of practice but is a pretty simple idea. I feel like this article sums it up pretty well. 

One possible solution, if you find a buyer that is willing to wait for it, i have heard of people taking a copy of the buyer's drivers license to the police station and asking them to run it to check for any red flags, or past offenses that prevent them from owning guns such as domestic abuse, or being a felon. I'm not sure if all police departments would do this or if they would charge to do it, but it does help keep them out of the wrong hands. Also I would write your own bill of sale with both parties signing it basically just saying "I ______ sold this model of gun, for this amount, to ______ on this date. Serial number __________" then both parties sign the bottom of the page. This simply removes as much liability as possible. Or as Charlie suggested you may be able to find a FFL dealer that will run the same paperwork as if they were buying it from them for a small nominal fee and act as a broker of sorts. The most money will be made selling it to a private individual but i understand your caution. I have had FFL transfers done for as little as 10$. 

Alternatively, you could only do the machete tube portion and keep the axe on a loop off of you belt as it wouldn't interfere with swinging a machete to greatly. A little crazy, a little out there, but it could work with a little trial and error. With a large PVC tube you could easily return them without having to feel for a sheath with a little practice. And you'd look like a bad ass :P 

According to this Physics forum, altitude does not directly correlate with dew point. So it will greatly depend on the other atmospheric conditions which will very from one time to another. So not something you can count on in order to avoid dew formation entirely. 

I think a lot of it depends on what type of terrain, and how primitive you plan on being. I personally would take a sharp medium sized pocket knife (3-4" blade) to be used for food prep and other small tasks. Ideally this would be of decent hard steel that can take some abuse without chipping or dulling very quickly. The secondary blade depends somewhat on what you want to carry, if you will need to be chopping wood for fires every night a small lightweight hatchet is quite useful, i may opt for this over a secondary large knife as they can also be used for light digging if the soil is not saturated with rocks. However, if you know the area you will be hiking in has plenty of downed wood you can simply gather this may not be necessary. If you are hiking through rough terrain without trails and really getting out there into dense vegetation or woods you may find a machete is more useful than a hatchet. I also always take a small knife sharpener in my pack, they don't weigh a whole lot but do make life easier if you will be using your blade quite often. Not necessary but a personal luxury i enjoy, especially if you are going to be using something for digging or other utilitarian purposes. The wire saws can also be handy for small branches for fire wood but are somewhat tiring to use at times, although they weigh significantly less than a hatchet. A mess kit or multi-purpose cooking dish/pot/mug is also a necessity in regards to food prep in my humble opinion, you can do without one but it makes life much more enjoyable for me if i have something i can throw on the fire to cook just about anything in. 

Different Types of Life Cycles There are three types of cicada life cycles: Annual: Cicada species with annual life cycles emerge every year, for example, Swamp Cicadas (Neotibicen tibicen) emerge every year in the United States, and Green Grocers (Cyclochila australasiae) emerge every year in Australia. Periodical: Cicadas species with periodical life cycles emerge all together after long periods of time, for example, Magicicada septendecim will emerge every 17 years (Find out where they'll emerge next). Proto-periodical: Cicada species with proto-periodical life cycles might emerge every year, but every so many years they emerge in heavy numbers, like the Okanagana. Different Varieties How Many: There are over 190 varieties (including species & subspecies) of cicadas in North America, and over 3,390 varieties of cicadas around the world. This number grows each year as researchers discover and document new species. Cicadas exist on every continent but Antarctica. The Largest: The world's largest species of cicada is the Megapomponia imperatoria, which is native to Malaysia. The largest species in North America is Neotibicen auletes, aka the Northern Dusk Singing Cicada. The Loudest: According to the University of Florida Book of Insect Records, the Neotibicen pronotalis is the loudest cicada in North America, and can achieve 108.9 decibels. Australian species of cicadas, like the Double Drummer (Thopa saccata) are said to exceed 120 deafening decibels at close range. The loudest cicada in the world is supposed to be the Brevisana brevis, a cicada found in Africa. At a distance of 50cm (~20") B. brevis reaches 106.7 decibels. Longest Lifecycle: The most well-known cicadas in the North America are the Magicicada periodical cicadas, aka "locusts", which have amazingly long 17 or 13 year lifecycles. Brood VI (17 year life cycle) will emerge in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia in 2017. Read more about where and when. Edit for Sue: I found your question on the Cicada Mania site. They had this to say.. 

You might watch this clip and see if it is a similar noise to what you are hearing. Summer Cicada sounds YouTube Additional information from comments: They are interesting creatures for sure, they live for up to 17 years, but once they crawl out of the ground and shed their shell and get wings, they only live for about 5 or more weeks in which they try and find a mate. Also a favorite food of copperhead snakes and the sole receptacle for cicada killer wasp larva, So they have tough lives once they crawl out of the ground. Cicada killers are a wasp species that uses these to house their larva, they sting them which paralyzes them and they drag them to their burrows where the wasp lays eggs in the still living cicada, its young then hatch later and eat the cicada for nutrition. The holes you find, if the size of your finger in width may be wasp burrows. There is usually but not always a pile of dirt around the hole that looks like it has been balled up.

A bit hypothetical, but ruling out being able to use a solar still, or the SODIS method, could you make water drinkable by using the suns heat through a magnifying glass? Paper self ignites at 451° F , water boils at 212° F, but that is at one concentrated point when paper burns using a magnifying glass. Would it be possible to boil a small about of water using the same method? For sake of it lets say you have a magnifying glass that is 3.5" across, and a plethora of different small containers available glass or metal. I realize you could then start a fire, and boil water in a metal container but i am just curious if it is possible to heat the water enough to be drinkable without placing it on a fire using this method. As fires cause smoke lets say you are in a less than desirable place where the smoke from a fire could give away your location when you didn't want it to. 

Article Source Feeling for these changes in the line is the trickiest part and takes a little practice but this is one of the best ways to fish for bass in my opinion. The linked article also talks about several other variations of ways to set up the worm and is worth a read, the Texas rig just happens to be the one i know best and use personally. Carolina rigs are similar to a Texas rig but also utilize a a swivel to stop the weight and a lead before the worm as shown below: 

The difference between what i do, and this image is in the very bottom picture their hook comes back out and the tip is then put back in, when i set them up i don't let the hook come back out the other side. I find it is better to leave it about halfway through, this reduces the chance of snags and that way when you set the hook it pops out the side and usually results in good mouth placement as long as you set the hook at the right time and don't wait for them to swallow it. 

For bass fishing, what i use is referred to as a Texas rig, which also happens to be where i live so i'm partial but i also feel like it is one of the better ways to fish with a rubber worm. They are done like so, a slip sinker (aka a worm helmet) is threaded onto the line before the hook, then...
