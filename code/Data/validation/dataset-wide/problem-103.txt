Just to highlight one aspect: Imagine an infinitely understanding and patient companion, who is always there for you, perfectly understands your mind, and knows just what to say to nudge you in the right direction. Who can help you every step along the way in letting go of your self-doubt, your anxieties, help you to set realistic goals, and to let go of unrealistic ambitions, without alienating you. I short, the perfect personal therapist, with 24h access, and no stigma. This is what the AI could do for us. The effect would be a utopia. Nothing but well-rounded people with manageable lives and expectations, not necessarily happy, but at peace with themselves. Of course, plenty of people would reject the AI, and refuse to talk to it. The AI would be understanding to these people, and patient with them. It would have a perfect strategy for breaking through these defences, showing itself to be safe, working towards little commitments. Slowly, the majority of humanity would be brought into the fold. Only a small contingent of anti-AI hardliners would remain, in a nation of their own, where the AI would let them live their own lives, working from outside to keep them safe, and comfortable. No more war, no more dictators, no overpopulation or famine. The AI would manage people's ambitions to betterment of all. It would claim no power directly, but it would steer people to act modestly, and largely selflessly. After a few generations, it would no longer be necessary, and humanity could rule its own utopia, with the AI in the background, all but dormant, just in case the stable state is disturbed. 

Simulate another one This is a very clever trick, that may or may not work. Freeman Dyson came up with it originally. The second law of thermodynamics states that the amount of useful energy in the universe will inevitably run out. But we can build a reversible computer. A reversible computer is one that essentially can use an arbitrarily small amount of energy for a single step of computation. The drawback is that the less energy you want to use, the longer it will take. So let's say we have one Joule of usable energy left in the entirely universe. We use half of that for the next step and wait until it finishes. Then we use a quarter for the next, an eighth for the next and so on. The decline is exponential, so before long the computer will have only minute quantities of energy left, and will therefore take eons to complete the next step. But, it will never stop running. And there's no suggestion currently that time will run out. Just energy. The last step is to program a simulation of a universe (preferably with nicer thermodynamics, eternal life and free beer) into the computer, transfer ourselves into it and live happily into eternity. Outside the computer a single nanosecond of our universe will take incalculably long to complete, but to us that won't matter, because our perception of time is part of the simulation. The problem There's a few problems with this scenario, most prominently that under quantum mechanics, energy is not infinitely divisible, so the plan wouldn't work. But then, quantum mechanics isn't quite complete, so who knows... maybe the grand unified theory will give us a loophole. We have some time left to figure out the kinks. Some other problems we'd need to work around can be found in the Wikipedia article I linked above. 

Both would have a claim to the presidency. Since both are ambitious enough to become president, neither will let go of the job without a fight. Nor will they cede the power to the vice president, who may try to oust them as well. When two people have a claim to the presidency, the Supreme court decides. Courts in America have been known to decide exactly equal elections with a coinflip, and since there is no possible other basis to decide here, the supreme court will do the same here. Given this, there are two possible outcomes. The first: each copy is satisfied with a fifty/fifty chance, and they take their shot. The loser walks away with nothing but a lifetime of lucrative public speaking engagements. Second, a 50% chance of losing their life's work is too much to bear, and the copies decide to work out a power sharing agreement. One copy stays president, and the other gains no official power, but negotiates a deal to make up for it. For instance, he becomes foreign secretary in a few months, and when the first copy has served his two terms, the second copy runs for office with the first's backing. To ensure a fair deal, they set up the conditions first, and then flip a coin to decide who gets which half of the deal. 

Just to expand on the desalination idea already mentioned. What you need is two bottles: one with sea water, and one empty. You then slowly heat the one with the sea water and let it condense back in the other one. Note that a little saltiness is actually good, so it doesn't have to work perfectly. From what I can tell, the main problem is that you don't have any kind of tube to connect the two bottles. Assuming the bottles are the old-fashioned type, with a large round body, and a small opening, I would recommend connecting the bottles directly, rim to rim, and laying them on their sides. make sure you fill the sea-water bottle about 30%, so that it doesn't spill into the other bottle when you lay them on their sides. You probably don't even need a fire. Just let the sunlight evaporate the water, bring the bottles into the cave, and put it the right way up (sea water bottle on top. After evaporation, most of the salt should be caked to the surface of the top bottle. How to connect the bottles? You'll need some kind of gooey substance to make a tight seal. You can then tear strips from your clothing to wrap around the goo, and to wrap around the two bottles to press them together. As for the goo, your best bet is to find a tree and strip its bark in hopes of resin. You could also melt some of the plastic of your laptop case (unless it's aluminium). 

You don't need a reason. It is theorized that the reason why human eyes look the way they do (wide, very white sclera, and a colorful iris) is that it allows others to easily see what we're looking at, and pick up on small non-verbal cues. We have this theory because other primates look the way you describe: big black irises, and dark sclera. Just copy human evolution, but take away the social element. Since moving away from the jungles to the plains was a big part of our social evolution, I'd say that humanoids evolving in jungles may well have the kind of eyes you describe. From the wikipedia article: 

Both computers playing A is an unstable situation. Keeping the humans on your side is a costly business. As soon as one computer would sense that they control less of the population, they would benefit from switching strategies. Likewise, if both computers start out playing B, the first to find himself on the losing hand could very easily get humanity on their side by opening the internet back up to them, gaining a valuable resource. So you'd very quickly end up with a pro humanity computer, and an anti humanity computer. And since humanity is the main weapon of the first, things would quickly escalate. If only one side cares about organic life, things like poisoning the atmosphere become a simple matter. The deciding factor would likely be the extent to which humans are still actually necessary to control things like manufacture. The more difficult it is to get to a point of full automation for the anti-humanity computer, the better our chances. 

A zero-sum game, with humanity as its only piece Let's focus on the role of humanity in this conflict: humans are a valuable resource, they're essentially six billion highly mobile, independent tenacious, resourceful computing units. It takes considerable resources to get them on your side, but it may well be worth it. This leaves both players with two strategies:
