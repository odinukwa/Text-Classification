Let $X_n$ be the space of $n$ distinct labeled points in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which is equipped with an action of the symmetric group $S_n$. It is well known that the total cohomology of $X_n$ is isomorphic to the regular representation of $S_n$, but I would like to know what representation one gets in each degree. When $\mathbb{R}^3$ is replaced with $\mathbb{R}^2$, this question has been answered by Lehrer and Solomon, and Getzler expresses this answer in a beautiful form in Equation (2.5) of $URL$ If we let $f_{n,i}$ be the degree $n$ symmetric function associated with the action of $S_n$ on the degree $i$ cohomology of the configuration space, then Getzler gives a nice infinite product expansion for the power series $\sum_{n\geq 0}\sum_{i\geq 0}(-x)^if_{n,i}$. If there were a formula similar to this one for the configuration space of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$, that would be great. 

Let $X = \operatorname{Spec}(R)$ be a conical Poisson variety over $\mathbb{C}$. This means that $R$ is a non-negatively graded Poisson algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ with $R_0 = \mathbb{C}$ and that the Poisson bracket is homogeneous of negative degree. Assume that $X$ admits a conical symplectic resolution. Examples to keep in mind are: 

Let $S$ be a symplectic leaf of $X$. Q: Is it possible for the fundamental group of $S$ to be infinite? In the first four examples listed above, the fundamental group of every symplectic leaf is finite. I don't know whether or not this property holds for quiver varieties, or for other examples. 

Let $X$ be a variety and $p\in X$ a point. Let $IC_X$ be the intersection cohomology sheaf, and let $IC_{X,p}$ be its stalk at $p$. Let $IH^*_p(X) := H^{*-\dim X}(IC_{X,p})$ be the local intersection cohomology of $X$ at $p$. Let $TC_pX$ be the tangent cone to $X$ at $p$. Question: What is a sufficient condition to obtain an isomorphism $IH^*_p(X) \cong IH^*_0(TC_pX)$? If $X$ is stratified and there is an affine cone $S$ which is an etale normal slice* at $p$ to the stratum containing $p$, then $S$ has to be isomorphic to the normal cone, and the local intersection cohomology of $X$ at $p$ will be isomorphic to the local intersection cohomology of $S$ at the cone point, which will in turn be isomorphic to the local cohomology of the tangent cone at the cone point (since the tangent cone is isomorphic to the normal cone cross a vector space). So a sufficient condition for the existence of slices would also be a sufficient condition for the isomorphism. *By "etale normal slice", I mean that there exists a vector space V and a map from an open subset of $V\times S$ to $X$, etale at $(0,0)$, taking $(0,0)$ to $p$ and $V\times\{0\}$ to the stratum. Since etale maps induce isomorphisms on tangent cones, $S$ would have to be the normal cone. 

Let $f:X\to Y$ be a smooth morphism of schemes of finite type over a field $k$, and suppose that $f(p) = q$. Let $Z = f^{-1}(q)$ be the fiber of $f$. Let $\hat{X}$ be the formal completion of $X$ at $p$, $\hat{Y}$ the formal completion of $Y$ at $q$, and $\hat{Z}$ the formal completion of $Z$ at $p$. Does $f$ induce an isomorphism $\hat{X}\cong \hat{Y}\times\hat{Z}$ of formal schemes? This seems like it must be both true and well-known, but I can't find a reference! 

Let $\mathbb{C}[S_n]$ be the regular representation of the symmetric group $S_n$, and let $\mathbb{C}^n$ be the vector representation. Question: Does there exist a representation $V$ (of dimension $(n-1)!$) such that $V\otimes\mathbb{C}^n\cong \mathbb{C}[S_n]$? If so, does $V$ admit any particularly nice description? For example, when $n=4$, we can take $V = V(4)\oplus V(2,1,1) \oplus V(2,2)$. This problem has a nice solution if we only ask the isomorphism to be equivariant for the subgroup $S_{n-1}\subset S_n$. We can realize $\mathbb{C}[S_n]$ as the cohomology of the configuration space of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^k$ for any odd $k$ (even $k=1$ is okay). Then forgetting the $n$th point gives us a fiber bundle that behaves like a product on cohomology, and we obtain an isomorphism $\mathbb{C}[S_n]\cong \mathbb{C}[S_{n-1}]\otimes\mathbb{C}^n$. But we have broken the symmetry by choosing which point to forget, so this is only an isomorphism of $S_{n-1}$ representations. I want to do everything $S_n$-equivariantly, which is indeed possible when $n=4$, as the above example demonstrates. Update: As Geoff Robinson observes in the comments below, an $S_n$-representation $V$ is a solution to my problem if and only if the restriction of $V$ to $S_{n-1}$ is isomorphic to the regular representation. 

Let $Y\subset X$ be a codimension $k$ proper inclusion of submanifolds. If we choose a coorientation of $Y$ inside of $X$ (that is, an orientation of the normal bundle), then we get a class $[Y]\in H^k(X)$. If $X$ and $Y$ are oriented, then $[Y]$ may be defined as the fundamental class of $Y$ in the Borel-Moore homology of $X$, which is isomorphic to the cohomology of $X$. What is the simplest definition of $[Y]$ in the general case (where $X$ and $Y$ are not necessarily oriented)? Note that a simple generalization of this question would be to ask how to define the pushforward in cohomology along a proper oriented map. (Then $[Y]$ would simply be the pushforward of $1\in H^0(Y)$.) I would be happy to know the answer to this more general question, but I asked the simpler version to be as concrete as possible. 

Here's how I understand the argument in Slodowy's book. Sticking with Tamas' notation, let $X$ denote the Hilbert scheme and $D$ the punctual Hilbert scheme. You'd like to define a deformation retraction from $X$ to $D$ by sending every point to its limit under the dilation action. Unfortunately, as Ben points out, $D$ is not fixed by the dilation action, and this function isn't even continuous! So that doesn't work. Instead, you choose a closed tubular neighborhood $A$ of $D$ such that $D$ is a deformation retract of $A$; this is possible by a basic result in algebraic topology (Slodowy cites Spanier's book). You then use the dilation action to define a deformation retraction from $X$ to $A$. More precisely, send every element $x\in X$ to the first element of $A$ that it hits when you dilate it inward. This is a perfectly well-behaved map, and it does the trick. 

Consider the map $\varphi:S\to R$ given by $$\varphi(x) = \frac{4x}{4-x},$$ and similarly for $y$, $z$, and $w$. One needs to check that this is well-defined; indeed, $\varphi$ maps $xyz+xyw+xzw+yzw+xyzw$ to $$\frac{4^4(xyz+xyw+xzw+yzw)}{(4-x)(4-y)(4-z)(4-w)}.$$ Since $\varphi$ obviously induces an isomorphism on the associated graded of the filtration by powers of the maximal ideal, it is itself an isomorphism. More explicitly, the inverse homomorphism $\psi:R\to S$ is given by $$\psi(x) = \frac{4x}{4+x},$$ and similarly for $y$, $z$, and $w$. Note also that this generalizes to any number of variables. Thanks David and Vladimir for your answers; that was really helpful for getting me going! 

What is the correct definition of a regular point of a map in algebraic geometry? More specifically, let $f:X\to Y$ be a map of varieties with $f(p) = q$, and let $Z=f^{-1}(q)$. Let $\hat{X}$ be the formal completion of $X$ at $p$, $\hat{Y}$ the formal completion of $Y$ at $q$, and $\hat{Z}$ the formal completion of $Z$ at $p$. I would like a nice condition on $f$ that implies that $$\hat{X}\cong \hat{Y}\times\hat{Z}.$$ Intuitively, this should be an algebraic version of the statement that $p$ is a regular point of $f$. I do not want to make any smoothness assumptions about $X$ or $Z$. In particular, if $X = Y \times Z$ and $f$ is the projection onto $Y$, then every point of $Y\times Z$ should be a regular point of $f$, even if $Z$ is singular. (The conclusion about formal neighborhoods is obviously true in this trivial case!) 

Let $U$ be a representation of $S_m$ and $V$ a representation of $S_n$. Then the representation $\operatorname{Ind}_{S_m\wr S_n}^{S_{mn}}(U^{\otimes{n}}\otimes V)$ has a nice interpretation in terms of symmetric functions. If $\operatorname{ch}(U)$ and $\operatorname{ch}(V)$ are the Frobenius characteristics of $U$ and $V$ (symmetric functions of degree $m$ and $n$), then $$\operatorname{ch}\operatorname{Ind}_{S_m\wr S_n}^{S_{mn}}(U^{\otimes{n}}\otimes V)= \operatorname{ch}(V)[\operatorname{ch}(U)],$$ where the square brackets denote plethysm. I am interested in a graded version of this result. More specifically, let $X$ be a space with an action of $S_m$ and $Y$ a space with an action of $S_n$. I am interested in the representation $$\operatorname{Ind}_{S_m\wr S_n}^{S_{mn}}\left(H^*(X^n)\otimes H^*(Y)\right)$$ of $S_{mn}$. The naive statement would be that $$\operatorname{ch}\operatorname{Ind}_{S_m\wr S_n}^{S_{mn}}\left(H^*(X^n)\otimes H^*(Y)\right) = \operatorname{ch}(H^*(Y))[\operatorname{ch}(H^*(X))],$$ where $\operatorname{ch}(H^*(X))$ and $\operatorname{ch}(H^*(Y))$ are symmetric functions of degree $m$ and $n$ with coefficients in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[t]$. I'm pretty sure that this statement is correct when the cohomology of $X$ is concentrated in even degree, but otherwise it is wrong. The issue is that, at the level of $S_n$-representations, the Kunneth isomorphism $H^*(X^n)\cong H^*(X)^{\otimes n}$ needs to be interpreted in terms of super-vector spaces: the action of the simple transposition $(i,i+1)$ picks up a sign when the two cohomology classes being swapped have odd degree. For example, if $X=S^1$ and $n=2$, then $H^2(S^1\times S^1)\cong H^1(S^1)\otimes H^1(S^1)$ is the sign representation of $S_2$ rather than the trivial representation. So my question is: Is there a "super version" of plethysm for symmetric functions with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ for which the last displayed equation is correct? I know that the answer is tautologically "yes"--one can just translate from symmetric functions to representations, do the induction, and translate that, and take this as the definition of super-plethysm. But I'm looking for something explicit enough to allow me to do calculations in SAGE. 

Let $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1,…,x_n]$, let $J\subset R$ be a graded ideal, and consider the initial monomial ideal $\operatorname{in}(J)$ with respect to some term order. Suppose that we are given a linear subspace $V \subset \mathbb{C}\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ such that $R/J$ and $R/\operatorname{in}(J)$ are both free of finite rank as a module over $\operatorname{Sym}(V)$. Now suppose that we have a finite set $S$ of monomials that constitute a basis for $R/\operatorname{in}(J)$ as a module over $\operatorname{Sym}(V)$. Does $S$ also constitute a basis for $R/J$ as a module over $\operatorname{Sym}(V)$? (Note that this is easy if $V=0$. Note also that $R/J$ being a free $\operatorname{Sym}(V)$-module does not follow from $R/\operatorname{in}(J)$ being a free $\operatorname{Sym}(V)$-module; it is an important part of the hypotheses that BOTH are free.) Example: Let $J = \langle xy + xz + yz\rangle \subset \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$, with $\operatorname{in}(J) = \langle xy\rangle$. Let $V = \mathbb{C}\{x-y, y-z\}$, and let $S = \{1, x\}$. Then $R/\operatorname{in}(J)$ is a free $\operatorname{Sym}(V)$-module with basis $S$, and the same is true for $R/J$. 

Let $M$ be an oriented matroid on the ground set $E$, and let $L(M)$ be its ranked poset of covectors. By definition, $L(M)$ is a sub-poset of the poset $\{0, \pm 1\}^E$, ordered by putting $0 < \pm 1$, with the rank being the number of nonzero coordinates. However, I want to consider $L(M)$ as an abstract ranked poset, rather than as a subposet of $\{0, \pm 1\}^E$. Question 1: Is the oriented matroid $M$ determined, up to isomorphism, by $L(M)$? Question 2: Is there a nice characterization of which ranked posets arise in this way? 

Let $X$ be a scheme and $p\in X$ a closed point. We say that $(X,p)$ is etale locally isomorphic to $(Y,q)$ if there exists an etale neighborhood of $p$ in $X$, and etale neighborhood of $q$ in $Y$, and an isomorphism between them. Note that etale maps induce isomorphisms on tangent cones, so if $(X,p)$ is etale locally isomorphic to $(Y,q)$, then $TC_pX\cong TC_qY$. In particular, if $(Y,q)$ is itself a cone, then it must be the tangent cone to $X$ at $p$. My question is about a partial converse to this statement. Question: When is $(X,p)$ etale locally isomorphic to $(TC_pX,0)$? (Note: This question is a reformulation of Local intersection cohomology without the intersection cohomology, which may have scared people off.) 

Does there always exist a scheme $Y$ and a finite flat morphism $g:Y\to S$ such that $g^{-1}(U)$ is isomorphic to $X$ as a scheme over $U$? Given two such extensions, do they have to be isomorphic?
