Except for item 3, which is less common, these differences aren't inherently female-specific. It's not uncommon for women to use men's packs and vice versa. The best recommendation is to try the pack on and see how it fits. An incorrect torso length will probably stand out the most, but be cautious of how well the hip and shoulder straps fit. For extended trekking purposes, it's worth loading your pack with its expected weight and spending a good amount of time (at least 15-30 minutes) walking around with it on. Finally, if the larger pack doesn't end up fitting, all is not lost; there are ways to do longer treks with smaller packs if you have the time to make some changes to your packing list. 

I wouldn't buy an ultralight tent if you're going to put the tent through severe trauma or require significant space (e.g. to use chairs inside). I do think the main difference in buying is cultural; unless you are poking it with sticks tents shouldn't experience that much damage. The modern ultralights should be good for most any weather outside of snowstorms and severe windstorms. One trend is to cut tent weight by replacing the inner tent with ever increasing amounts of mesh (compare the BA Seedhouse to the BA Copper Spur linked in your example). The REI (a US equivalent to MEC) Half Dome sold today is almost entirely mesh compared to the one I purchased almost a decade ago. I don't mind this, as it gives you the option to sleep under the stars in good weather, and if you're using the rainfly there's really no need for a waterproof inner wall. The second, somewhat more recent trend, is to experiment with pole geometry. Instead of a traditional dome design or simple crossed poles, many manufacturers are incorporating Y-joints and shorter segments to increase living space while cutting weight. The BA Copper Spur is a good example of this, as it does both. Be aware that many tents have only a small area with the stated headroom, which is not so good once you have two people. The more vertical the sidewalls are, the better the livability. The inner tent fabrics are somewhat delicate but not unreasonably so. A separate footprint will extend the life of the tent floor, and I'm not sure what would be damaging the walls of the tent. (Perhaps children falling through a partially-zipped door, but usually the tent just flexes.) The main difference between many 3 and 4 season tents I've seen is the use of a traditional dome structure with the poles (better wind and snow resistance) as well as the ability to fully cover the mesh panels of the inner tent. (I've used the 3-season REI Half Dome mentioned earlier in winter snow during a severe windstorm; ridge gusts were over 90mph, fortunately we were down in a valley. A small problem was spindrift forced through the small air vents in the rainfly and past the mesh panels of the inner. The other issue was the two-crossed-poles design being vulnerable to snow piling up on the long sides.) The MEC Nunatak appears aimed at mountaineering and has additional features to beef it up; it is probably overkill outside of that environment. Ultralight hikers consider even the lightweight tents from large manufacturers too heavy, although some offerings from makers like Big Agnes are now considered reasonably decent for someone getting into lightweight hiking. A multi-person shelter also helps bring down the weight-per-person. Smaller "cottage" gear makers build shelters out of materials like silnylon (most common) or cuben fiber (expensive). These can be smaller and more delicate and range from simple tarps to fully-enclosed shelters. (Keep in mind that single-wall tents have condensation issues that double-wall tents help shield you from.) Two example makers are Tarptent and Six Moon Designs. I find the Tarptent Stratospire 2 good for two people; the offset trekking pole design adds space for two people to easily sit facing each other. (Some designs, most commonly the floorless pyramids, are quite usable in winter.) Finally, $600 is approaching Hilleberg territory. Those tents are bomber; the fabric is an incredibly strong silicone-coated nylon. I have a Jannu for winter mountaineering, but would suggest taking a look at the Kaitum 2 (or 3). At 3.1 kg it isn't that light, but it's a good trade for something more than capable of handling exposed tundra and arctic winds. Also, the tunnel tent design makes for good roominess inside; do a Google image search for examples. They turn up used on gear forums every so often; I recommend keeping an eye out. Otherwise, something like the BA Copper Spur you found should work quite well. Edit: I glossed over the materials a bit, and it's one area where technology has improved. Modern tent poles like DAC's lightweight aluminum offerings are made via seamless extrusion rather than sheet welding. This allows for poles that are strong, thing, and lightweight, but do cost more due to the manufacturing process. (Newer alloys also help.) Excluding canvas, tents will come in nylon or polyester of varying weights. For car-camping family tents where weight is not an issue, a heavier-weight fabric may be used. Nylon is somewhat lighter and tougher, and comes in various weights. 70D nylon, common for floors, weighs about 1.9oz per square yard while a much lighter 30D weighs in at 1.1oz per square yard. This is an area where there's a direct tradeoff between weight and durability. The other advance is the use of silicone to make the fabric waterproof, which results in a stronger and lighter material than traditional polyurethane coatings. (E.g. a 30D silnylon may have twice the tear resistance of a 70D nylon coated with polyurethane.) 

If using a static tag line, cut it a bit longer than your lead line to account for stretch (e.g. 65m rather than 60m.) If rappelling on only a single line, use a carabiner block (tied on the thicker line) rather than assuming the knot won’t be able to pass through the anchor. (It can and has.) If rappelling on both lines, the thinner line will feed through the rappel device faster. Feeding the thicker line through the anchor will mitigate this. Tie stopper knots and back up your rappel. 

Local Agencies Your emergency contact can always call the local emergency number, but contact information for the Sheriff's office (or appropriate local agency) where you'll be starting your hike may be more useful. Transport Are you taking a car, bus, train, plane, or llama to the trailhead? For personal vehicles, the make, model, color, and license plate number are helpful. (If you take a bus, the driver or other passengers might remember you.) Itinerary A map with your expected route highlighted is most convenient. Alternate routes, expected campsites, and potential side trips should also be noted. You should have a rough idea when you'll start, when you'll return, and generally how quickly you cover ground. Communications What navigation or signalling equipment do you have? If a PLB, is it registered? If a cell phone or two-way satellite messenger (InReach, Spot, etc.), what type is it and what's the contact information? Is there a URL where it displays its location? Equipment You don't need to list every item, but larger items are easier to spot and smaller items may be found by searchers. An easy way to inventory is to simply lay everything out on the floor and take a picture. While you're doing this, it's also good to note your shoe size, model, and include a picture of the soles. 

Yes, your GPS device can tell you the distance to a location. You will first need to load the cache locations onto it. Both the manual and the quickstart guide that came with it have information on how to go about this. You can also manually enter cache coordinates as a new waypoint. When doing so, be careful that the coordinate formats match, e.g. if your cache is located at do not enter it as . Check your manual if you're unsure how to change the format your device is currently using. Once stored as waypoints you can then select one to navigate to. Your device should then tell you the approximate direction to head and the distance, as well as any other details depending on how you've customized the display. Side note: You can also get a rough estimate by comparing your current coordinates to the cache coordinates, but this is particularly tedious when coordinates are in degree-based formats. 

No experience here, but the Google Satellite images appear to show trails. The USFS maps also show trails, but those differ from the ones in the sat imagery. In either case, the terrain seems safe, and pictures from someone else's trip report suggest open terrain with no significant problems. 

Also keep in mind that while they may be nice and clean on the way in, coming out they will be muddy and slushy. My pack has a crampon patch and straps, so that's where I carry them. Further discussion and images can be found here: $URL$ 

Collapse them down, sandwich them with the points facing each inwards, and wrap the straps around them. You can then use a "real" crampon bag to hold them, or improvise. Some ideas for packaging them include:

Another option is the traditional root cellar. However, it usually requires digging quite deep into the ground to construct a root cellar that will maintain ideal temperatures. You may be able to get somewhat OK results with only a foot or two of soil as the top insulating layer. 

The suggestion to use wasp spray for defense seems to be common enough that there’s a Snopes page on the topic. This particular urban legend is more often brought up in the context of defense against people, but it seems now to have been extended to bears. I would stick with the bear spray. In the US, the phrase “It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling” will be found on pesticide containers. This is a hint that this may be a bad idea. Wasp spray usually contains poisons rather than irritants, which creates additional legal problems if you use it on people or bears. Regarding the claims around range, a can of UDAP bear spray has a range of 30-35’ (9-11 meters). Wasp sprays tend to be effective out to 15-22’ (6-7 meters). This oversight may be due to the origin of the myth in an anti-human context: keychain style pepper sprays have a shorter range, although even the anti-human sprays are available in longer-range versions. Regarding precision, bear spray presents in a conical cloud. Beyond close range that cloud will be about 100” (2.5 meters) in diameter. In contrast, wasp spray presents as a narrow stream, the better to soak a small nest rather than contaminate a larger area. This is a negative for the wasp spray, for the same reason that firearms are considered less effective than bear spray: most people’s ability to effectively aim goes away when under extreme stress. Edit to add: The neurotoxins in wasp spray (usually pyrethins) have a far greater impact on insects compared to mammals. This comes from differences in body size, absorption, capacity to metabolize, and sodium channel sensitivity. For example, in cases where people have been sprayed, no incapaciting effects were seen. To summarize, the claims of the proponents appear to be incorrect regarding range, misapplied regarding accuracy, and baseless regarding actual efficacy. As there doesn't appear to be a mechanism by which wasp spray would deter a bear, actual testing is unlikely to be performed. 

The stove and fuel can should both fit in the pot (be careful of getting the can stuck). The larger sack is an extremely bulky down puffy that's more appropriate for arctic temperatures. The blue and black rolls are rain gear, the orange pouch is a 2-person emergency bivy, and the green fleece is, well, a fleece. Add a quart-sized ziplock containing a first aid kit, and a Nalgene bottle, and it should all fit. I'm leaving some items out (compass), but I think that accounts for all the large items. 

(Note that USNG and MGRS use a letter pair for the 100km grid squares whereas UTM doesn't; UTM instead has additional digits. The Easting and Northing values always have the same precision: 3x3, 4x4, and so forth. I personally prefer the USNG style.) 

I believe the answer to your specific question is no; the only boots I know of with tech fittings are hard boots made of plastic or carbon fiber. However, I think you may be underestimating those boots. AT boots are hard plastic but can still offer a soft feel. Transitioning to skinning uphill consists of not just unlocking the heels but also switching the boots to a walking mode. In walking mode, many feature a wide range of cuff rotation. For example, the Dynafit TLT6 boot offers a cuff rotation of 60°, and the recently released Atomic Backland offers an impressive 74° rotation. This means you can actually walk reasonably comfortably in them as opposed to being forced to clunk around as you've likely seen people do in alpine ski boots. Depending on the boot you may have additional options. The older TLT5 model offered about 5mm of flex at the toe, and many boots feature removable plastic tongues that you can take out if you want even more softness. AT soles are usually rockered (curved, like hiking boots) to improve walking. Weights for the lighter weight models range from around 0.8kg to 1.3kg per boot (or as little as 0.56kg if you have the cash). Finally, you may also wish to consider telemark (aka 3-pin) boots and bindings. You won't be able to lock the heel but the telemark turn offers an alternate way to tackle steeper downhills. (And with good technique you can still pull off parallel turns.) 

There seem to be many widespread assumptions about helmet design, particularly regarding how well they handle multiple impacts. The poor availability of the relevant standards documents[0] does not do much to help this. As others have mentioned, relevant helmet standards include EN 1385 (for kayaks and whitewater sports) and EN 1077 (alpine skiers and snowboarders). There is some overlap between the standards, and it seems likely that the paucity of multi-rated helmets is more likely due to the expense of testing than significant design differences. Here is a rough comparison of the major requirements for these standards: 

Now, there is some contradiction between the need to get someone into dry clothes and the need to keep them insulated from the environment; obviously if they are in the open with howling winds and rain it's probably a bad idea to pull off their clothes. So, let's look at some other protocols that may be better suited for the solo traveler or those who were only briefly immersed (e.g. fell in and climbed straight out). For this I'll reference a "re-warming drill", which you can read an example of at $URL$ This method relies on both body heat (as previously mentioned) and also proper gear selection: wicking fabrics and synthetic insulation. If you don't have the proper clothing, it's not likely to work very well. The type of clothing system mentioned in this article may be referred to by many different acronyms; searching for ECWCS or PCU should give good results. In the first form of the drill, the troops pair off and immediately add synthetic insulation layers. One person sets up the tent, the other sets up a stove and gets snow melting or water heating. With that done, both burrow into their (synthetic) sleeping bags. As soon as they can, they then get some hot drinks and calories into them and lie back down. The second form of the drill addresses the case of what to do without tent, sleeping bag, or stove. In that case, the troops simply put on their synthetic insulation layers and their packs, and then marched for a few hours at a slow, easy pace (enough to generate heat, but not to sweat). 

Regarding the knot at the top, if you didn't knot the two strands together below the anchor, you would have a double-strand rappel. A double-strand rappel requires both strands to be fed through both the descender and prusik; if you put them on only one strand, you go splat. Splitting the descender and prusik between the ropes means they no longer back each other up in such a situation. If either of the two fails, you go splat. Finally, if you use Paul's technique (reepschnur) but attach yourself to the pull-down side, that's right, you go splat.
