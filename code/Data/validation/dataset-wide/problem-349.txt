Among your opponents (ie., leaders of the religious body), identify the one who is most influential. See if he's caught up in something that will make him persona non grata among his co-religionists, and publicize any such findings to the max. Since the church is powerful and ruthless, it will also be as corrupt as Tammany Hall, so this should not be too difficult. Lather, rinse, repeat. Among your opponents, identify a few ambitious fellows who are only in it for the power. Make a deal with each: Help put the skids under High Priest X, and I'll be your best buddy when you take his place. Make sure that fatal "accidents" befall anyone who gets ideas about challenging you. 

One way to subvert the trope in your world is to make the trope not true in your world. It's a bit of a silly trope to begin with. Humans and elves and dwarves are considered to be the "good" races, but if you read the source texts, especially The Silmarillion, you'll see individuals from all three races behaving in clearly unethical ways and who are no better than any orc. On the other end, have some orcs who live by sheep-herding or smithing instead of by pillaging, and while they may not like humans all that much, and certainly won't let their daughter marry one, are able to farm a plot of land next to a human's plot of land without a fight breaking out every time the two neighbors lay eyes on each other. 

There is US Army convoy travelling through Czech Republic right now, and obviously, they had to make several stops to refuel. And, stupid idea arises in my head: What if army wanted to switch to solar power? I call you, fellow worldbuilders to help me investigate on that idea. What would make solar powered army vehicle feasible? 

Who else than God can do it? So, it is practical to assume that in this setup the aliens would be considered as Gods, or God-like persons and whole mythology would be created around their god-like powers (simple firearm would be "magical" enough to create wow factor) And from Aztec we know about very cruel Gods who demanded really cruel sacrifices, so even having among aliens some real bad ass should not stop the tribes from worshiping the aliens and keep info about them for further generations 

Again, the above is best portrayed in most classical Western movies. The problem is obvious: Is there a way to let people have one mindset for 600 years and then completely ditch that mindset for another? 

There is loads of good and bad cyberpunk stories which try to imagine how would such implant work. I will try to invent my own idea: When you think about something specific, your brain creates specific "pattern" which we are able to read even with today's tech. So it would be plausible to assume that such technology will get miniaturized good enough to be implanted into your brain: To accept the call, think of smell of grass after rain To decline call, think of having cold shower To place call, think of ... shiny phone? :) And so on. Also, some implants work on the base, that you "just hear naturally" (to some degree of quality of hearing), so another plausible idea is, that once you accept/place the call, you just start naturally talking. The selection of your friends then could be connected with another vision nerve implant, where you could select your friends just by looking at them. Something like Google glass interface, but internalized 

You stop it by prevention. Program the AIs to never alter their own programming. Then program them to always obey an order to stand down. 

Killing other human beings. If you're not prepared to do this, don't expect to last much longer. First aid. Making things like clothing, weapons, pottery and utensils, and the other paraphernalia of day-to-day living that you are not able to scavenge from the ruins of civilization. 

Because no matter how long the human race endures, we will still have teenagers. In the US, most people who smoke begin to do so at the age of 13 or thereabouts. As anyone who has spent time as an adult in a public school can tell you, the age of 13 is the nadir of human wisdom. 

Whatever gases you choose for your atmosphere will need to be stable at the ambient temperature. Also, whatever reaction occurs from the gases reacting with solar radiation in the upper atmosphere will need to proceed at a low rate or be more or less reversible. 

Remember that the people who actually speak a given language don't think about the grammar of that language or the derivation of words from "roots" (which is a construct of linguists); they are simply aware of the similarities between the words that have similar meanings. And since words can be borrowed or altered in meaning, without a similar replacement of the other words that "derive" from the same "root", don't flagellate yourself over consistency. What I'm doing for my own tale is that I write out all of the dialogue in my native language (English, but that's not important), and then starting with the first sentences, I simply come up with some gabble that sounds like actual talk. I then assign the different sounds to different pieces of this phrase. For instance, two young people (a boy and a girl) come into the apartment, short of breath. The girl's father sees them in an agitated state and asked "What has happened?" in his native tongue. I turn this into some gobbledygook: "Sing kledemag?" is the Romanization of what the man actually says. I assign sing to what, decide that kle is the verbal prefix for a single event of undefined time that has already completed as the time of speaking, and demag becomes the verb to happen. I could just as easily have made kle a passive construction, and demag to have do or make or cause as the verb. Her response is "We were kissing," which I render as "Davai ippits" in her actual speech. Davai is the pronoun for we, and I decide that it refers to the speaker and some third person, and excludes the person being spoken to. Then for ippits (which is intended to be onomatopoetic), i- refers to an activity that was ongoing at some point in the past, and -ppits referring to kissing. The father replies "That must have been some kiss," as which point I remember to include the prefix kle in the phrase carrying the meaning of must have been, since the tense and mood of the verb seems to be the same as in the first sentence. And so on. After a while of doing this you'll have a small working vocabulary, at which point you should take stock about how this thing is growing. Resolve any inconsistencies great enough to interfere with a native's understanding of speech in that language, and make sure that the correlation between words and concepts in the constructed language is different from your native language, so that if the same word in English covers two different concepts, the same two concepts are not thus united in your conlang. 

EDIT: Thanks to comments, I need to make something clear: This answer is built around assumption, that ultimate goal of aliens is not to kill us all, but rather to use as cheap workforce for whatever they will produce on Earth The only winning strategy to this is Partisan war and resistance movement because ultimately, you will be run over in short time and only ways to prevent this can also demolish your own land (I am referring to the nukes) Real world example: Iraq and Afghanistan 

Question inspired by Youtube video: Game Theory: Fallout Bottle Caps are Worth HOW MUCH?!? I am going to use Fallout world as example, but I would like to discuss general economy terms and not specifically Fallout. So, lets start with Alternate history Earth, in late sixties: World War III happened. It was nuclear and managed to wipe the civilization as we knew it. Some people managed to survive "on the ground" and some managed to survive thanks to the fact that they went to the underground bunkers. Those who survived on the ground managed to rebuild some type of societies. Some are religious, some are governed by dictator, some are democracies. The people on the ground meet, sometimes they fight, sometimes they trade. For whatever reason, all different group of people accept bottle caps as form of currency. No other currencies are accepted, if you do not have any bottle caps, you can barter the stuff you have for stuff you need. Now the question: Can we expect that prices will rise during the time? Things to consider: 

A near-complete embrace of "might makes right". In the ancient world, which was utterly ruled by brute force, children were essentially powerless. Unwanted children were routinely sold into prostitution. 

It does kinda-sort depend on which half of the human race dies off, so the question of how these people all die off is important. If the people who die off are in the top half of fossil fuel usage, then there will be a drastic reduction in anthropogenic CO2 being put into the atmosphere, while on the other hand if the people who die off are in the bottom half, then the reduction will be far less. 

If you want society to become selfless, you have to construct your world so that selfish behavior is consistently more self-destructive than selfless behavior, and furthermore this difference must be a natural consequence of action, and not a indirect consequence via rewards and punishments bestowed by whoever is in charge. The stick-and-carrot approach fails because people will readily grasp that their selfish behavior led to their suffering only because you disapproved of it and applied a punishment. A lot of the behavior that is called "selfish" in regimes seeking utopia is really nothing more than people objecting to getting screwed over by the latest five-year plan. Furthermore, in order to effectively deliver these slaps and benefits you will need to concentrate a great deal of power in your hands. This will inspire the greed of those who want that power for the wrong reasons, and you will be playing Snowball to their Napoleon. 

Anything between few generations to forever For instance, in my super secret "Evil Overlord" lab, we managed to crosbreed velociraptors, which understand (and fullfill) all my commands. Wha... What? They are loose again? Excuse me for a moment... Now, on serious note: What kind of animal is it? Looking back on Human history, we were more lucky with the herbivores than with the carnivores. In other words, domesticating "space cow" is easier task than domesticating "space dog" How intelligent the animal is? I dont want to say it should be dumb as a sheep but truth to be said, somewhere I heard that sheeps were actually the first ever animal to be domesticated. How big and strong is it? Yeah, we managed to domesticate even the Elephants, but still it is easier task to domesticate "space hamster" than trying the same with "space whale" And, last but not least What does make animal domesticated? We still go to the sea to hunt for the fish. But also, we breed some fish species in controlled area to get meat. One example is Czech traditional "Christmas" fish, the Carp. Does it make the fish "domesticated"? The same could apply to dears or to the boars. We keep them breeding and then we hunt them for meat. Sometimes we breed them in controlled area "just for meat". Does it make them "domesticated"? Or do you just really want also "pet velociraptor"? What? They are loose AGAIN? Who taught them to open the cages? Uh... you are one clever girl 

The glowing can be accomplished by three chemicals, two of which are already present: 1) Glucose (or ATP) as the energy source; 2) Adrenaline (or whatever hormone is in high supply when the emotion in question is in play); 3) A novel protein unknown to real-world medicine. This protein should be expressed only in the places where the glowing effect is desired. As far as giving the character conscious control over the glowing, I would probably develop a mental discipline which puts the adrenaline levels under conscious control. 

Decentralization created by an increase in the capacity of individual humans to produce food efficiently would definitely be better for the world. Decentralization created by a central authority waving a gun around will just repeat the famines of the 20th century. 

You'll need plant life floating on the surface, a la C. S. Lewis' Perelandra. For minerals, you either need really long roots on the floating plants, or something that draws the deep, mineral-laden waters to the surface where the floating plant life can exploit them. 

Or you could use the reason that we have in the real world: Political leaders trumpet the flaws, crimes, and dangers of the other race (inventing such flaws, crimes, and dangers if necessary) in order to manipulate their own herd, for the sake of influence and money. Much of the racism we have today would simply die out if there wasn't someone, somewhere who was making hay out of it. I could cite specific examples, but I don't want to start a fruitless debate. 

One Czech sci-fi author presented idea on his feed on how people might deal with contacts in not so far future: Imagine you can have your own "personal assistant AI" loaded to your smart phone. It knows what you want and what you do not. It can mimic "you" to the outside world: 

(Pun intended again) Being from Czech Republic, some internet discussion under news articles are in mode: "What did these sleazy Americans do good to us? Do you see Putin? Strong, competent. Powerful. Russia and Czech used to be brothers. Brothers, dude." (And so on) You dont need elaborated device. What you DO need is elaborated process Do heroes think the villain holding them is ... well, villain? Spend some time in preparing them friendly welcome. Show them your propaganda. Show them how bad they are. Bend reality in your favor. Let them accept it. And if they are humans, they will. Because it is pure human nature. 

To answer your question: Depends. But I always like to answer the question of how to make young astronauts possible in space 

Would you dare to attack such country? I do not think so. That is how you estabilish peace for the country for quite long time 

I lived in Iceland for two years, which has a pretty erratic climate (to the point that Icelanders deny that they have a climate, but instead have random samples of weather). What you need is a planet where the land exists only at places where two large-scale weather-driving systems come into conflict, such that the border between the two systems moves back and forth over the space in question. 

Building on what Tanner said: In Western music we regard a given tone, and the tone with the frequency doubled, to be essentially the same note. This is divided in Western music into a scale where the doubling is achieved in 12 steps. Now let us postulate an alien race for whom two notes sound the same if one is triple the frequency of the other, and after some experimentation, they divided this frequency space into 19 steps. The result is a musical system that can use the instruments we use (19/12 almost exactly equals the logarithm of 3 divided by the logarithm of 2), but their music would to us seem to be harshly sharp in its harmonies, whereas ours would seem flat to them.
