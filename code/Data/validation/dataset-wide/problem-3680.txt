To answer your question directly the answer is NO. Now let me detail why and how you can lose fat and maintain muscle in 4 points: I Rate of body fat loss 1 gram of fat is approximately 9 calories. To consume one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of fat you need to create a deficit of 9000 calories. Meaning that if you plan on losing one kilogram of fat in a week you'll have to eat a total of 9000 calories less than what you spend which is roughly 1300 calories a day. If you add cardio/weight training (which is tremendously more effective) to the point where your calorie expenditure is 3000 calories a day, you'll need to eat 1700 calories a day for a week... THEORETICALLY. This is not taking into account the variations in metabolic rate that occur in a deficit for example (eating less makes your body consume less in summary). Not even taking into account the loss of muscle to get energy. II So how did my friend lose so much ? Water my friend. Water mass is very variable and can change really fast overnight. I myself can lose 1 kilogram in one day without being on a deficit. It happens if I go out a little, drink some alcohol (even two beers are enough). I am therefore a bit dehydrated and lose water really fast. I've lost up to two kilograms in one night (even with less than 10% body fat). Your friend is probably losing glycogen and water fast. That's it. III What can I do to trigger faster results ? Doing what your friend does is not necessary. There are a few ways to lose mass fast which I wouldn't recommend: 

IV Then what can I do to trigger sustainable results ? a. Slow and steady fat loss. As boring as that sounds, it seems to be the best way to keep a good amount of muscle mass and lose fat. Weigh yourself daily upon waking up. Aim for 0.5-1% bodyweight loss a week (if you're not obese - in that case it will be higher). If your weight loss is higher, eat more. Otherwise you're losing more muscle than you think. If you don't lose weight, check your weightlifting program, macros/calories, sleeping habits and stress levels. b. Protein intake According to this study, having a higher protein intake for the same total calorie intake will make you keep more Fat free mass. Try consuming 2g protein/kg of bodyweight. c. Exercise Exercising properly will make you retain more muscle mass too according to this paper. So pick a good weightlifting program that you enjoy and stick at it. One small very personal advice on this: the simpler it is, the more efficient it will be. Try to find one with very few full body movement (Starting strenght... ). d. Lower sodium intake. Water retention will add mass around the waist. At very low body fat percentages, I personally noticed that after a high-sodium eating meal, I woke up with less definition in my abs. Considering of course that caloric intake wasn't higher. Therefore try getting less sodium. Progressively from what you get now. Caution: According to this paper, adverse effects can happen on very low sodium levels e. Sweat it out Lose water. And drink a lot to replace what you lost in order to avoid water retention. f. Sleep You can find online quite a bit of research on sleep deprivation and testosterone levels. This hormone is highly correlated to muscle repair and fat mass. This article talks about the effect of sleep reduction on testosterone. Sleep well to get the most out of your training and diet. To sum it up: 

To answer your question directly, there is indeed a huge difference between fast cuts and slow cuts. The first point I'm making will point you to a very clear study about it. To add more on it, here is a bit more detailed answer. There are multiple factors to consider when planning a diet: I Rate of weight loss Studies have shown that there seem to be an optimal threshold with which fat loss was optimal in regards to lean body mass. It is said that 0.7% of body weight loss a week is optimal. II Protein intake According to this study, a combination of high protein diet and resistance training is the best way to conserve muscle when trying to lose weight. A diet high in protein is key during prolonged weight loss III Sleep Sleep is a huge factor. This article is about a study where they compared the rate of fat loss between people sleeping 5.30 hours a night versus 7.30 while being on the same caloric intake. They found a tremendous difference between the two, in favor of the more sleep group. IV Training Multiple styles of training exist. This paper argues that Aerobic training is the best regarding weight loss while resistance training is optimal for conserving muscle mass. I hope this helped ! 

Experiencing headaches on Keto diets in normal. It usually happens after 2-3 days. Two mains reasons for this: I Your brain normally functions on glucose. When glucose is missing, your liver starts producing ketones. These are the only substitute your brain can use to get energy. However it can take some time for them to be produced. During that time your brain will not have enough energy and fogginess/headaches can occur. You will get passed it once your liver starts producing enough ketones. According to the ketogenic diet by Lyle McDonald, your brain can only get around 75% of its energy from ketones. Make sure you still get some carbs. II Keto diets can be high in sodium. A high sodium intake results in dehydration (sodium being a diuretic). Mild headaches are usually caused by dehydration. Make sure you drink more water to avoid that common side effect. I hope this helps ! 

Then go home, eat well, sleep well, avoid stress, drugs. Repeat. This is just an example, feel free to add/change to whatever you like the best. I hope this helps ! EDIT Just to clarify about your routine. I think it is good, but a bit too advanced for someone who can still gain 5 kg in 3 months. Start with less, build over time and it will pay off more in the long run. 

As pointed by @Dark Hippo in the comment section, many parameters can influence your weight gain. But as far as nutrition goes, here is how to go about it: Let's set optimal weight gain for a beginner/intermediate to be around 0.5% of your body weight a week. Since you weigh 68 kg, that would mean 340 grams a week. Your goal being to be 72 kg, you can be there in 11-12 weeks. Let's round that up to 3 months. At that rate, you'll mostly put on Fat free mass. I would suggest weighing yourself every morning upon waking up. Track your progress. And count calories/macros. If after a week you see yourself weighing more than what you're supposed to, back off a bit on the calories. If instead you're not putting on enough weight, up your calories. Repeat the process until the goal is achieved. 

By eating mostly fats and protein you deplete your glycogen levels. To be stored inside the muscle, it needs water. On that kind of diet you lose glycogen and water very fast. However as soon as you start eating carbs again your glycogen levels rise up as well as muscle water retention. Your weight will get back to normal really fast. 

Thank you for adding more info in the comments. I wouldn't say your routine is bad, but here are a few things to remember when designing a workout routine: I Progressive overload As a beginner, you need very little stimulus to progress. You can do 2 sets of 12 reps 3 times a week and see massive results. The volume (weight * sets * reps) that you do for each body part seems very high for a beginner. The problem is this: There is a point where your body gets used to the training stimulus and will need more to progress. Let's say you start by doing 2 sets of 12 reps 3 times a week. After a few weeks/months, you won't see as much results. To trigger more reaction, all you need to do is start doing 3 or 4 sets of 12 reps 3 times a week. It is still reasonable. Then after a few weeks add a seconds exercise for example. Then more reps/weight/sets. Build up the volume over the years to keep progressing and counter the ability of your body to adapt. However if you start straight away like you did by doing quite a lot of volume, you won't have much room left for increased stimulus. Doing 9-12 sets total for each body part is a lot. When you hit a plateau, you'll have to go up to 15 or even 20 sets. Maybe play on frequency too. Here is an interesting study on progressive overload II Muscle protein synthesis Training your biceps every day is not an issue itself. Biceps are fairly small muscles and recover fast. However you don't get the full benefit of muscle protein synthesis response after a workout. It lasts for 48 hours. You could try training them every other day instead and let them fully rest before hitting them again. See if it works for you. You can read about it here III What I would do Just to add up on this and be more precise. Here is what I would do, assuming that your goal is aesthetics: Train 3 times a week. Full-body routine. Starting with the main lifts (Squat, bench, deadlift) for 3 sets of 5-8. Adding 2.5/5 pounds every time or change for a variation of the main lift. Then move on to accessory movements. One for each body part. 3 sets of 8-12. Add weight if possible every time/change the exercise. Full example 

Therefore, as your goal is to burn more calories, I would suggest doing what I do now. Focusing on bit compound movements, and spend less time in the gym as a result. A good program would be Starting Strength. If you are interested, here is a typical day of training of me (not like Starting Strength though): 

Studies According to this study, aerobic training is the most efficient in order to lose overall body mass and fat mass. However if you want to retain the most amount of muscle, they advise to engage in Resistance Training. Personal experience On a more personal note, I used to do quite a bit of reps and sets with lost of different isolation movements. This lead me to have a low body mass and metabolism. I was eating around 2000 kilocalories a day. When I switched to strength training, I was doing half the time in training, but only focusing on big movements (Squats variations, Press variations and Deadlift variations). As a result, my time spent training went down, my strength exploded and my metabolism followed the same path. I was eating 4000 kcals a day, still not gaining weight. Sleep patterns were perfect too. As a side note, it took some time before eating 4000 kcals a day without gaining weight. I had to go up over time, starting at 2500, gradually increasing. 

Total time: 45 minutes. I do that 3-4 times a week. Need around 3000-3500 kcals a day right now to maintain bodyweight. I'm a male, 23yo, 5'10 (177 cm) and 167 pounds (76kg). I hope this helps ! Idriss 

From research and personal experience there is no difference. I came accross this paper where they analyzed the differences between people working out in the morning (7-9 am) and people working out in the afternoon (5-7 pm). They found no statistical difference between the two in terms of hypertrophy. So research tells you to go all out as you would do in the evening. My personal experience is this: I have been working out in the morning for 3 years and a half now. My sport is powerlifting (I tend to handle heavier weights and not do cardio/high reps). As a student in a medium-sized town there was no gym available in the morning before 9 so I bought a small rack, a barbell and some weights for my dorm room. I woke up at 5, ate and started warming up around 5.30. I usually hit my top set around 6. I never had any issues although I have to admit that eating enough in a short amount of time and working out on a full stomach is not ideal. I now work and take transportation to go to the gym before starting the workout. I therefore have 1 hour and 15 minutes between my meal and my workout. It feels great, I don't feel full anymore and it fits the schedule perfectly. In summary, research shows that there are no differences in terms of efficiency of the workout. And as long as you have enough time between your meal and your workout you should be fine. I hope this helps !
