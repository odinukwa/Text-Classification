From page 3 of this link, chapter 8, page 661 of the AR5 report. What the report basically says is that tropospheric ozone has a significant greenhouse effect, 0.4 watts per square meter as a result of the man-made increase since 1750, which is nearly equal to the warming from the methane increase, despite measurably lower total concentration and a lower percentage increase. (note, there are considerable measurement uncertainties, 0.2 to 0.6 is given as the range). But even the low end of that estimate makes ozone in the lower atmosphere a powerful greenhouse gas. The Ozone layer (0.05 watts per square meter cooling estimate) corresponds to a thinner ozone layer today compared to 1750 (as far as I can tell, I didn't see that spelled out), but assuming that's the case, a thicker ozone layer should (could) provide a small amount of warming, but 0.05 watts per square meter variation is pretty insignificant. 

A word on precession, precession affects the Earth's climate because the Earth has a land dominant hemisphere and a water dominant hemisphere. Precession also works with the seasons leading to warmer or colder winters or summers. If there's low axial tilt, then precession won't have much effect on a planet's climate. Mercury has minimal axial tilt and no significant variation between it's two hemispheres, so it's unlikely that Mercury's precession changes it's climate much. Certainly not like the effect it has on Earth, such as turning ice ages on or off. Precession is also mostly Newtonian. Relativity just adds a percentage point or two to the rate of precession in the case of Mercury. 

What this seems to be is a very poorly constructed combination of various studies, one study appears to be a 7 million year stepwise reconstruction of climate, between 25.5 and 32.5 mya. That study may be excellent, but the writer of the wikipedia article was too lazy to bridge the open spaces between various research reports into a coherant series of paragraphs. In defense of the Wikipedia writer, pretty much every statement is followed by a reference, so if you read the references, it probably makes a lot more sense. It's just very poorly constructed as a paragraph read on it's own, which is how nearly everybody who checks the page will read it. 

Fred's answer looks correct, but in this case, the source is right there under the chart. US Energy Information Administration (type "other gases" in the search box) Explained here in the footnotes 

Lava doesn't destroy water it evaporates it into steam. This steam rises high into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into rain which it falls back onto the Earth's surface where it gets hot again, evaporates and rises. This isn't too different than how rain is made today, except that the evaporation process is slower and mostly driven by sunlight, wind, running rivers and by plant transpiration, not as much by a scorching hot surface. Rain is a very efficient form of heat transfer. Water evaporating very efficiently cools the surface. I read or heard somewhere, don't remember where, so take with a grain of salt, but I heard that the Earth rained constantly for millions of years when the planet was young and the surface was hot. To thermally split water into Hydrogen and Oxygen, the temperature needs to be about 2,000 degrees C. Lava isn't that hot, though it's possible that the very young earth might have been hot enough to actually destroy some water and turn it into it's elements, Oxygen and Hydrogen, some of which would have recombined, and some of the hydrogen could have been lost as Earth's gravity is too low to retain all of it's hydrogen, but for the most part, Lava doesn't destroy water it simply evaporates it. It's also possible that some other chemical interactions would absorb and change the chemical property of some of the water, but for the most part, Lava just turns water it into steam, which is still water, just in a different state, like how Ice is still water, just not liquid. Update: On the comments below, that's on the Earth Science/Astronomy border, but there are a fair bit of unknowns on how much atmosphere and water the Earth has lost to the Solar Wind. One estimate says the Earth is losing about 90,000 tons of hydrogen every year. Source. Since that hydrogen effectively comes from split water molecules by UV rays high in the atmosphere and by mass, Water is about 8 parts Oxygen to 1 part hydrogen, then 810,000 tons of water is converted to 720,000 tons of Oxygen every year. If we multiply that by 4 billion, just cause, you know, why not run the numbers, assuming consistency, over that time, the Earth has lost 3,240 trillion tons of water and added 2,880 trillion tons of Oxygen. Consistency is a big if, but these numbers seem reasonable enough to work with. The oceans contain about 1.4 million trillion tons of water so the estimated 3,240 trillion tons of water lost is irrelevant, less than 1/400th of the Ocean water at the current rate of loss. Oxygen is different. 2,880 trillion tons of Oxygen is more Oxygen than is currently in the Earth's atmosphere, but much of the Earth Oxygen formed in the upper atmosphere combined with other elements like Iron in the oceans or Methane gas, or helped form the planet's granite, so even though the solar radiation should have produced lots of Oxygen from water over time and Hydrogen that was lost, the amount of water is negligible and the Oxygen has been useful in many ways. But I digress as those are current estimates not historical ones. The solar wind, while it does blow hydrogen off the Earth and in effect removing water from the Earth, the effect is slow enough that it's a minimal change. But the Earth's magnetic field wasn't always there and it isn't as old as the early and late heavy bombardment periods. Our magnetic field is thought to be about 3.5 billion years old. Source. So it's entirely possible that the Young Earth lost a significant amount of water prior to the magnetic field. Venus has no magnetic field to speak of but it's retained it's atmosphere's heavy elements but very little of it's water. Mars is much smaller, so it's less good at retaining it's atmosphere than Venus. Nobody knows how much atmosphere and water the young Earth lost to space. It's entirely possible Earth lost a pretty good share of it's water to the Sun's UV rays prior to it's magnetic field, and in part due to it's high temperature, but I don't think anyone had a good guess on the precise numbers. To return to the question above, Magma on the surface isn't a big factor unless it's hot enough to split water into individual molecules. It's the temperature of the upper atmosphere, the atmospheric escape velocity, the solar wind and magnetic field are the larger factors. 

There's no shortage of articles to be found on sea level rise as well. This is, of-course, one of the problems that a good climate scientist faces. "When will that happen?" - The honest answer is, we don't know, we can predict about when it's likely to happen, so the skeptic says "so you don't know."- which misses the point entirely. There's no question bad things will happen as a result of climate change. It's just hard to predict exactly what will happen or exactly when. 

Source. Lets ignore that debate for brevity and look at the overall theory of increasing greenhouse gas driven climate change. The Energy from the sun is same, so, why does Earth get warmer? The answer is trapped heat. So, what does this look like from space? Counter intuitively, from space the Earth looks colder than it did 30/40/50 years ago. It's giving less thermal radiation into space. This is because heat is being trapped in the lower atmosphere and oceans. The upper atmosphere on Earth is actually cooling and contracting and less thermal radiation is leaving the Earth, not more, even with the warming surface temperature. Measuring the decrease in heat that leaves the Earth is one way to measure the total amount of heat being trapped by climate change. In time, a new equilibrium will eventually be reached and heat in will equal heat out again but for now on Earth, Heat in is greater than heat out. The difference is heat added, which does things like warm the air, the oceans and melts the ice. In your scenario, there's no change, it's already warmer, but it's warmer in equilibrium, so heat in = heat out. In other words: A warmer atmosphere at equal heights doesn't mean more heat leaves the planet, because the CO2 rich atmosphere makes it harder for the thermal radiation from the warm surface to reach space. The greater heat is balanced out by a greater percentage being reflected back to the surface. The amount that goes into space is equal on the 2 planets. 

Hundreds of thousands of years: Milankovich Cycles 2/5/10/50/100 million years . . . Isthmus of Panama, Himalayas, drifting of Antarctica, Glaciation of Greenland, variation in plant life. There can be many causes of natural climate change. One of the ways we know that the current climate change is man made is that we can rule out causes, for example, ocean currents didn't suddenly change in the late 80s. No new land bridges formed. Causes are testable and causes have signatures. CO2 or greenhouse gas driven climate change has a measurable signature. It's not just that temperature is rising but where it's rising that helps answer these questions, poles vs equator, land vs oceans, upper atmosphere vs lower.
