Go to HR immediately with all the information and trace of these requests that you have. This supervisor is more than likely committing fraud or stealing from the company and is using you as a mule. In case his scheme would go sideways it's likely you will lose your job or even get into legal trouble. Do yourself a favor and prevent situations like this by reporting it. 

Seeing as this really Ã­s an extracurricular activity, I would expect that any participation is voluntarily. This should also mean that anyone signing up is doing so to achieve something and to make a difference, rather than just hanging out, wasting time. So, you could remind them that to make that difference some goals should be met. Meeting these goals and getting results will give the people their sense of achievement, and will strengthen their engagement. If this kind of thing is not voluntarily you will get people that are not interested, don't see the point, and would rather go home. 

Computer works should not be impossible, I have found typing is OK. Writing by hand is really hard though. A good spell checker like Grammarly will sure up many of your spelling difficulties. As always, pick trough the things you type with a small toothed comb. Don't type important things too fast and read through the things you write multiple times. When you have to read things, read slowly and make sure you don't read what you think the message is but what is actually written on the page. Discuss the issue with HR manager, not with any other management. This is a personal issue, the HR people will be more likely to handle it with the necessary sensitivity. Discussing it at least with someone at the company will also have the added benefit of promoting a feeling of mutual trust with your employer. Divulging such personal details just in case it may affect your work will at the very least give the impression that you take your work seriously. 

An offer means nothing until it is a signed contract. Contact them ASAP in order to set a date to sign the final contract. Contact them using a more direct means of communication than e-mail, i.e a phone call. This way you might keep your present job just in case they tell you they backed out. 

Is it acceptable? Not really. But from your description I'm not sure if it's a grave issue. In stores and factory floors "joking around" or a "light shove" is pretty commonplace. Manners are less formal than in a suit-and-tie environment. I would suggest first talking to the person and saying that you did not like it and would prefer the manager to not touch you again. Reporting it straight away in this case is 'taking a bazooka to a musquito' as they say here. If the behavior continues despite your explanation, then yes, you should report it. If however the hit was more severe than you make it sound and was a genuine aggression, then you should report it immediately. 

What does it matter? You seem to be under the impression that the fact that the possible employee had his/her parent at the interview indicates a lack of maturity but that may very easily not be the case. Why is it though that a parent bringing a child to an interview is more of a problem than a cabby bringing him? If the cabby was willing to wait an hour before taking the interviewer home would that have been a problem for you? Even if the whole premise of your argument is true and this is one massive mommies-boy who will suck at the teat of his parents for the rest of his life, what does this matter? Are his qualifications and experience predicated on what you consider to be "mature"? You are there to make a decision on whether this person is the ideal candidate for a job listing, not to make judgments on what you perceive to be a lack of maturity, if this is the type of thing that bothers you from a programmer then you are going to find it hard to find a candidate. Most programmers I know are a-social, borderline sociopaths with a god-complex dependant on the level of salary. Having mommy issues would be appropriate. 

This is harrasment. I am quite a direct sort of person. Whenever she starts this behavior I would simply state that since I am not ordering her around on how to look, she should not do the same to me. I would state that her behavior (petitions, gossiping,...) is offensive, verbally abusive and should stop. And I would do this in front of the people she is talking to. Maybe then she, or the others realize this is wrong. If this bullying does not stop by your own defense, contact HR, or whoever deals with these issues at your university and post a complaint with all the incidents you can recall. You might even do this immediately. 

Generally speaking, no full-time employment will commence without a work contract in place. In most cases what your employer expects from you will be made plain. So except maybe if it is expressly mentioned that wages will be reduced for slow work what he is doing is most probably a breach of contract. Even if tardiness is mentioned in the contract, contract law does provide the remedy that if a contract is deemed to be grossly unfair to one party then a petition can be made to make it invalid. I think you would have a decent case for that. Remember that a work contract is like any other, both parties have the right to have it enforced. You may want to employ the council of a labor attorney or at the very least a union rep, this seems to be exactly the type of exploitive behavior they fight against. 

I think a lot of good answers have already been given, but let me go in with another angle. Albeit impractical, you could start hiring employees or even contractors that are local to the specific region. One by one you could start having them trained on this new project and in time get the original employees out. 

You don't need to be the lead politician, you don't necessarily need to lead anything. You do however have to have some basic communication skills. Having a programming job most of the time does not mean you are behind a desk 24/7 and are allways left alone. IT and developers contain a higher-than-normal percentage of quiet, introverted people. It's best you brush up on communication skills and learn to communicate clearly in the professional environment. A very good read that may help you is How to win friends and influence people ~Dale Carnegie. Using and practicing the principles in this book will get you a long way. 

I don't see the need to burn any bridges here. If the person was asking for a recommendation then your professional image would be on the line and then you would have to think twice but as it is, you could easily with one little email send the person the details of the manager or even just a link to the job posting. This makes you seem like the helpful one and even if it does happen that the person is not suitable, you are not the bad guy. It is after all not your job to do the hiring. Maybe you are not even able to judge a worthy candidate seeing as there may be mitigating circumstances to this person hiring that you may simply be unaware of. 

In general you should only refer people that you know are decent candidates, since their performance has an impact on your image. In this case you have pointed out that you don't know these people, which is the right thing to do. It's up to HR now to figure out if they are good candidates or not. They should realize that you cannot vouch for their skills. I would not think of the response you got as a passive-aggresive note at all. I would just see it as a light-hearted comment. 

I see many answers/comments stating that the employer assumes that LGBT/Black/Insert any other minority needs easier questions to pass the interview, and that this is insulting. This premise is wrong. What is happening is that the employer wants to hire more diverse people, and since proportionally a lot less 'diverse/minority' folk is soliciting he wants to give them easier questions just to have relatively more people from that category pass the test, in order to get his diversity-barometer up. What this is, is discrimination. Apparently this company discriminates the common folk. Being 'special/diverse/LGBT/coloured/whatever' scores you bonus points, just because that is what you are. Playing the devils advocate: This could be seen as racism against the common, white, hetero, well-educated man.
