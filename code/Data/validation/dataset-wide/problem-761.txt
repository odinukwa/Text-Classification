The "approximate" part is that the Sun may be up to one day earlier or later than the quoted dates, just like the start of the seasons may be one day earlier or later than the average. (Actually, it is the calendar that is early or late with respect to the phenomenon.) Also, because of the precession of the equinoxes, these dates shift by about 1 day every 70 years. See $URL$ 

Based on the math in the Wikipedia article about the Airy Disk: The intensity of the starlight as a function of angular distance $\theta$ from the center is reasonably approximated by a Gaussian $$ I(\theta) = I_0 \exp(-\theta^2/(2\sigma^2)) $$ where $\sigma$ is a measure for the width of the intensity profile, which for an ideal optical system and diffraction-limited images is $$ \sigma \approx 0.42 \lambda N $$ (where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $N$ is the f-number) and which is independent of the peak intensity $I_0$. For a non-ideal or not-diffraction-limited system, the Gaussian should still provide a reasonable approximation, but then $\sigma$ is (much) larger than for the ideal system. The apparent edge of a star in an image occurs where the intensity $I(\theta)$ drops below a certain minimum $I_\text{limit}$, which (from the first equation) corresponds to an angular distance $$ \theta_\text{edge} = \sigma\sqrt{2\log(I_0/I_\text{limit})}$$ We can rewrite this in terms of visual magnitude $V$. For fixed $\sigma$, $I_0$ is a measure for the brightness of the star. Brightness is related to magnitude $V$ through $$ V = -2.5 \log_{10}(I/I_\text{ref}) $$ (with $I_\text{ref}$ the reference intensity for the magnitude scale) so $$\log(I_0/I_\text{limit}) = 0.4 \log(10) (V_\text{limit} - V_0)$$ and \begin{eqnarray} \theta_\text{edge} & = & \sigma \sqrt{0.8 \log(10) (V_\text{limit} - V_0)} \approx 1.36 \sigma \sqrt{V_\text{limit} - V_0} \\ V_\text{limit} - V_0 & = & \frac{\theta_\text{edge}^2}{0.8 \log(10) \sigma^2} \approx 0.543 \left( \frac{\theta_\text{edge}}{\sigma} \right)^2 \end{eqnarray} So, the difference between the limiting magnitude and the star's magnitude is proportional to the apparent angular area of the star in the image. 

First, note that by the time Andromeda is close enough for collisions with wandering stars to become a concern, Earth's average temperature will have changed significantly, and the planet will be unrecognizable. When Sol is 8.5 billion years old, it will still have hydrogen available for fusion, but as it fuses it contracts and expands differentially. The contraction causes hydrogen fusion to become more favorable, so that Sol will have 50% greater power output ($6 \times {10}^{26}\ \mathrm{W}$) and 3% greater effective temperature ($6000\ \mathrm{K}$). Fusion also causes Sol to lose mass at a prodigious rate (currently $4 \times {10}^9 \mathrm{kg/s}$); it will release $6 \times {10}^{43} \mathrm{J}$ from fusion, which corresponds to $7 \times {10}^{26}\ \mathrm{kg}$. That is about one hundred Earth masses of sunlight but only $1 \over 3000$ the mass of Sol. Gravitation with Earth decreases proportionally, so Earth's orbit might on average expand $3000\ \mathrm{km}$ per billion years. Other gravitational effects might change Earth's average distance by as much as $6 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{km}$, 4‰ of an astronomical unit. Expansion of Sol's outer layers due to reduced gravitation will increase its radius by 20%, $3 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{km}$. Thus Earth will receive nearly 50% more power as well. The energy balance of Earth wrt Sol gives the expected surface temperature: $$ \begin{align} \bar{a} = & 0.7 & \small\text{(Average absorption)} \\ P_p = & 1366\ \mathrm{W/m^2} & \small\text{(Average solar flux incident on Earth at present)} \\ P_f = & P_p \cdot 1.5 \approx 2000\ \mathrm{W/m^2} & \small\text{(In future)} \\ \sigma = & 5.670373 \times {10}^{-8}\ \mathrm{W/m^2/K^4} & \small\text{(Stefan-Boltzmann constant)} \\ \\ T_p^4 = & \frac{\bar{a} P_p}{4 \sigma} \\ \approx & \frac{0.7 \cdot 1366\ \mathrm{W/m^2}}{2.268149 \times {10}^{-7}\ \mathrm{W/m^2/K^4}} \\ \approx & 4.2 \times {10}^9\ \mathrm{K^4} \\ T_p \approx & 250\ \mathrm{K} \\ \\ T_f \approx & T_p \cdot {1.5}^{1/4} \approx T_p \cdot 1.11 \\ \approx & 280\ \mathrm{K} \end{align} $$ Since the average surface temperature on Earth is not $-20\ \mathrm{°C}$ — it is $+15\ \mathrm{°C}$ and already around $8\ \mathrm{K}$ warmer than in an airless future — we can see the atmosphere has a significant role in retaining heat. Assuming increasing cooling needs do not lead to the atmosphere retaining more heat, the average surface temperature can be expected to rise to $+50\ \mathrm{°C}$. The average temperature of Antarctica is now $240\ \mathrm{K}$ in winter and $270\ \mathrm{K}$ in summer. These can be expected to rise to $270\ \mathrm{K}$ (just below freezing) and $300\ \mathrm{K}$ (well above freezing) respectively, and this is a best-case scenario. Antarctica will melt. That will produce the largest component (60%) of sea level increase, in total around $100\ \mathrm{m}$. 

The specifics of the Pluto Charon system are complicated, so I will answer more generally for now. A single body orbiting the sun can be tidally locked with the sun if its rotational period (its day) is equal to its orbital period (its year). The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth because the period of one orbit of the moon around the Earth takes the same amount of time as one rotation of the moon about its axis. (Note that the Earth is not tidally locked with the Moon. One Earth day does not correspond to one lunar orbit.) A binary (dwarf) planet system (like Pluto and Charon) is considered to be tidally locked if their respective orbital periods about the common barycenter of mass are equal to their respective rotational periods, and all of these periods, for both objects, are equal to each other. You specifically asked about the tidal effects of the Sun on Pluto. Unfortunately, the complete answer depends on the orbital parameters of Charon and Pluto's orbits around the barycenter of mass. I will assume the orbits of Pluto and Charon are such that their orbital plane about the barycenter is not perpendicular to a radial vector drawn from the Sun to the barycenter of mass for the following explanation. (i.e. one body is slightly closer to the Sun at a given instant in the same way the Moon gets closer and farther from the Sun as it orbits the Earth). With this assumption, tidal effects from the Sun should slow the rotation of the Pluto Charon system about the barycenter (the orbital period of each body about the barycenter of mass should decrease over time). This slowing would occur because the radially inward (toward the Sun) side of the closer body would have a greater gravitational pull on it that the farther side of that body. Thus, the Sun's gravitational pull would attempt to slow the rotational period of that body (equivalently: increase the length of that body's "day"). This process I am describing is the same as the process that caused the Moon to become tidally locked to the Earth. The Pluto Charon system introduces complications to this explanation because of the highly inclined and atypical orbital parameters of the Pluto-Charon-[Other Plutonian Bodies] system, the varying masses of the system bodies, and the system's extreme distance from the Sun. The large orbital distance of the system from the Sun means that any tidal effects on Pluto and Charon are mild at their strongest. Thus, measurable changes due to tidal effects are next to impossible to measure over human time scales. 

You are free to pick your reference point any way you want. You could pick a $\text{HJD}$ at which the star is brightest, or dimmest, or exactly average, or you could pick the $\text{HJD}$ of the first observation, or you could even set $T_0 = 0$. If two people pick different $T_0$, then the phases they find differ by a constant value (modulo 1). It is convenient to set $T_0$ at or before the smallest $\text{HJD}$ in your observations, so that all $\text{HJD} - \text{T_0}$ are nonnegative, because the $\text{INT}$-like functions provided by calculators, computer languages, and software libraries don't all round negative numbers in the same direction. Many round all numbers towards zero, so that $+3.4$ yields $+3$ (as we want) and $-3.4$ yields $-3$, but here we want $-3.4$ to yield $-4$, otherwise you get negative phases before $T_0$ and positive phases after $T_0$. If your observations of brightness are evenly spaced in time, then you can use a Fast Fourier Transform to find the approximate period and phase. 

You can see for yourself for any date and location using the free Stellarium program ($URL$ The constellation that the Sun is in as seen from Earth does not depend noticeably on the precise location of the observer on Earth. It depends mostly on the time of year. Here are the approximate days of the year at which the Sun enters a new constellation: 

Venus has volcanism and weather, and those can cover or erode craters. There are relatively few impact craters on Venus today, indicating that the surface of Venus is at most 600 million years old -- meaning that any older surface features have been erased. The Earth's surface is even younger. During the Late Heavy Bombardment, in the very early history of the Solar System, there was a period of time when many asteroids hit the Moon, creating many large impact craters. It seems likely that the Earth and Venus got hit by many asteroids then, too. Yet, no evidence of these craters is visible on Earth or Venus today. So, if Venus had a moon and that moon crashed into Venus thousands of millions of years ago, then the impact crater would likely have been erased by now. And if Venus got hit by a sufficiently large object, then the energy of the impact might melt the entire surface of Venus, so that no lasting crater can form. So, absence of very big craters from Venus is not evidence that Venus never had big moons. 

The Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter and contains about 400 billion stars. Andromeda is bigger and denser; it may have one trillion stars and a diameter of 140,000 light years. It is 2.5 million light years away but appears six times larger than Sol. $$ \begin{align} d_M \approx & \frac{4 \times {10}^{11}\ \mathrm{stars}}{{10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2}} \\ \approx & 50\ \mathrm{stars/{ly}^2} \\ \\ d_A \approx & \frac{{10}^{12}\ \mathrm{stars}}{2 \times {10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2}} \\ \approx & 60\ \mathrm{stars/{ly}^2} \\ \end{align} $$ If the two galaxies were simply superposed, there would be about one hundred stars per square light year, viewed from infinitely far along the rotation axis. However, the Milky Way is a 2:1 ellipse as seen from Andromeda, while we see Andromeda as a 3:1 ellipse. Projecting both onto a plane between them, perpendicular to a line between their central black holes, would give a region of overlap with dimensions between $50 \times 50\ \mathrm{{kly}^2}$ and $50 \times 100\ \mathrm{{kly}^2}$, with at most half the Milky Way outside it. Sol is likely to be involved in the collision, since it is about 27,200 light years from the galactic center. That doesn't mean, though, that Earth will come close to another star, that Sol might collide, or that the solar system will be disrupted. Considering probabilistically the worst-case scenario (the entire Milky Way falls through Andromeda on their first pass), there is a mean free path for stars. The actual stellar density of the colliding galaxies is: $$ \rho \approx 1.4 \times {10}^{12}\ \mathrm{stars}\ /\ V_{A \cup M} $$ where the union of the two galaxies' volumes would be a very complicated expression. Very roughly, their volumes can be described as joined cones, ignoring their spheroidal dark matter halos (which are mostly harmless). $$ \begin{align} \rho \approx & \frac{1.4 \times {10}^{12}\ \mathrm{stars}} {\left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( {10}^3\ \mathrm{ly} \cdot {10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2} + 1.4 \times {10}^3\ \mathrm{ly} \cdot 2 \times {10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{3} \right)} \\ \approx & 0.28\ \mathrm{stars/{ly}^3} \\ \\ V_\star \approx & 3.6\ \mathrm{{ly}^3} \\ \\ r_\star \approx & {\left( V_\star \cdot \frac{3}{4 \pi} \right)}^{1/3} \\ \approx & 0.95\ \mathrm{ly} \end{align} $$ At a distance of 1.9 light years, Betelgeuse would look a lot like Mars. If we assume disaster results from a star closer than the diameter of the heliosphere (about 200 AU), then: $$ \begin{align} m = & \frac{1\ \mathrm{star}}{\rho \cdot \pi \cdot 4 \times {10}^4\ \mathrm{{AU}^2}} \\ \approx & 1.1 \times {10}^{21}\ \mathrm{m} \\ \approx & 7.2 \times {10}^9\ \mathrm{AU} \\ \approx & 1.1 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{ly} \end{align} $$ On average, a star can travel 110 thousand light years before it grazes past another, slightly less than the diameter of Andromeda. The proportion of stars from the Milky Way that do not approach within 200 AU of stars in Andromeda is at least $1/e^{1.4 / 1.1} \approx 100/400\ \mathrm{billion\ stars}$. For Earth to approach within 4 AU of another star (one Betelgeuse radius), it can be expected to travel at least 2500 times farther, which at a relative velocity of 300 km/s would take $9 \times {10}^{18}\ \mathrm{s} \approx 300\ \mathrm{billion\ years}$. 

I have not studied this galaxy cluster specifically. However, I can speak about systems like galaxy clusters that have a large number of bodies that are in close enough proximity to have a non-negligible gravitational effect on each other. For any such n-body system, where n is large (a solar system, a galaxy, a galaxy cluster,...), it can be assumed that, 1. there is a net angular momentum of the system, and 2. it is reasonable to assume that this angular momentum is non-negligible. I state 1 and 2 based on the following (very general model of solar system and galaxy cluster formation). Such n-body systems form by the collapse of a very large amount of gas, dust, and other minerals. When fully extended, these clouds are cold, the the velocities of any given molecule or atom in them is comparatively slow. However, it is very improbable that the total angular momentum of the cloud of gas is zero, and more importantly, that it is close to zero. From this point, it is easy to reason that, so long as no angular impulse is applied to the system and no mass is added or removed from the system, the gas cloud can collapse or disperse in whatever way is consistent with the conservation of angular momentum, and the angular momentum of the system will not change. Thus, a galaxy cluster like Abel 1689 should have a non-negligible angular momentum. But I have skipped over the most important logical step in the above argument. I simply assumed again that the angular momentum of the gas cloud would not be even close to zero, effectively shifting the level of the explanation up one level. Unfortunately, the best answer to "why do the gas clouds have non-negligible angular momentum?" requires explaining where the gas clouds came from. The extent of my understanding here is that the gas clouds that formed galaxy clusters only existed during the very early universe. Once they collapsed into galaxies, there is no process that could have caused a galaxy cluster (or even a galaxy) to disperse so completely that it forms a new very low density gas cloud that can re-collapse. Thus, the gas that made the galaxy cluster must have had an angular momentum if the galaxy cluster system is to have angular momentum. I do not know if the sum total of the angular momentum in the universe is said to be zero or some finite value. However, I do know that even if it is zero, localized regions of matter in a system that has zero angular momentum do not also need to have zero angular momentum. Thus, the Abell 1689 system could be one such local region with non-zero angular momentum. Continuation: According to The Cosmic Perspective: Seventh Edition, when considering galaxies that have not yet collided with another galaxy, the initial angular momentum of the protogalactic cloud is a large contributor in determining if a galaxy will be spiral or elliptical galaxies. Regarding elliptical galaxy clusters, TCP has this to say: "Observations of galaxies in clusters support the idea that at least some elliptical galaxies result from collisions and subsequent mergers. Elliptical galaxies dominate the galaxy populations at the cores of dense clusters of galaxies, where collisions should be most frequent. This fact may mean that any spirals once present became ellipticals through collisions." Thus, TCP suggests in this paragraph that at least certain clusters contain dense cores of elliptical galaxies that resulted from collisions and mergers of galaxies that had markedly different angular momenta, resulting in a new galaxy that has much less angular momentum. But this doesn't really answer your question either. I have looked also for scholarly articles to find some consensus on what the typical angular momentum characteristics are, and found very little. Most discussions of galaxy cluster formation discuss filament formation and collapse. The one article of note I found was from Tom Crawford at the University Of Chicago: askanastronomer.org "The most obvious and uncontroversial class of structures beyond the galaxy is the galaxy group or cluster. These structures consist of tens to thousands of individual galaxies that are bound by gravity to one other and orbit a common center. That center is not defined by some huge central object, as the Sun defines the center of our solar system, but instead by the center of all the mass in the cluster, including dark matter. In fact, the dark matter dominates the mass budget of galaxy clusters, outweighing the normal matter by about a five-to-one ratio." This description suggests more than just "random" motions of gravitationally bounded objects (galaxies), but does not definitively say anything about the net angular momenta of these systems.
