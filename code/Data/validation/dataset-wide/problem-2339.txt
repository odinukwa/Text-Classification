First off, the tyrannosaurus dinosaurs are in the suborder Theropoda, and were bipedal, which is a fancy way of saying that they walked on two feet. They had three toes and one dewclaw. The ones found in British Columbia were over 2 feet long and over 5 feet between tracks. Finally, these tracks are incredibly rare with discoveries in,

Personally, I would bet on explanation 2 as I kind of doubt that it actually comes from black sheep. 

Any of these should put an Ordnace Survey overlay into Google Earth and then you could combine that with the .kml file you already have. 

The easiest time to find them is just after a fresh snowfall. Optimum conditions are enough snow for the tracks to be clearly visible without preventing one from driving back roads. The way people and especially hunters will find tracks is to drive the back roads in the morning just after a fresh snow looking for tracks crossing the road where they are most visible. One wants to get up early and be the first one on the road since car tracks make it difficult to find them and it gets much harder once the snow starts melting. It's also possible but much harder to find them in the dirt or dried mud. The way to distinguish between mountain lion and dog tracks (which look similar) is that mountain lions can walk with their claws retracted, dogs cannot. Full grown mountain lion tracks are also larger than dog tracks and cat tracks are generally wider than dog tracks. You will also sometimes also see tail drag marks where their tail brushes the snow. Bigger mountain lions will have bigger distances between tracks. Here is a picture of a mountain lion track, note the absence of claw marks. 

I've recently learned that linen underwear is great against fungal infections that can be contracted in hot sweaty conditions. But elsewhere I had read that the best fabrics against sweaty or tropical conditions were synthetic fabrics that provide wicking thus preventing excess moisture build up. I just arrived in Taiwan where it's 34°C/93°F and plan to hitchhike around Asia for a year, as I've done before. Previously my biggest problem had been chafing. I've managed to find some synthetic short and trousers, so it should be better this year. But I'm also concerned about fungal infection. I get tinea pedis frequently when wearing shoes and I've had tinea cruris before and think that could be a showstopper for long distance walking in hot/tropical climates. But so far I still only have cotton underwear. Is synthetic preferable? I think I read somewhere that polyester is the worst in regard to jock itch! Or what about going with linen when not actively hiking and something else while out on the road? 

Image Source The problem comes when trying to label the bottles, as permanent markers or even cow id tag markers will rub off. Best solution I know of is to wrap the bottles with masking tape and then write on that but the problem is that once it gets wet the tape comes off. Is there a better solution for permanently labeling these? 

It's pretty usual to carry both a multi-tool and a regular fixed/folding knife. The knives on a multi-tool are okay for small tasks but once you want to do some serious cutting such as whittling or skinning or cutting food, a dedicated knife is much better than one that is included on a multi-tool. If you were trying to save weight, then I would suggest taking only a multi-tool but get one where the blade locks open. Its harder to use a knife if the blade doesn't lock. 

One practical use is to get an idea of how stable/chossy the rocks in a particular area are. From experience the orange (volcanic) rock type is much more unstable and more broken up. That makes it much harder to scramble up the mountains in the volcanic areas as opposed to the granite mountains in the pink areas. Knowing that can help plan a route and predict to some degree how difficult a scramble is going to be. 

I was lucky enough to be given an almost new double skin popup tent. Where I'm camping right now it's got windy a couple of times and rainy a couple of times. A friend of mine who is camping in his (several seasons old) dome tent says he thinks they're an inherently better design than popup tents against wind. But is this necessarily true? Is it generally considered that popup tents have a particular set of advantages and disadvantages in comparison to dome tents? ... apart from these points which I think are obvious: 

About a year ago I was given a three person dual skin popup tent. Almost new but possibly a factory second. (It's made by "Vango" and I think it could be a "reject" because one of the four guy ropes is not attached to the tent and looks like it didn't get ripped off but was never attached.) Anyway it's a great tent and I have used it on a grassy area, properly pegged, in reasonably solid rain with 3 people and luggage with minimal wetness. But now I'm camping wild at the beach and water has made it into the tent twice, always from one of the corners. When I first set it up on the beach instead of trying to use the pegs I weighed it down with rocks inside between the inner and outer skins. (The standard pegs are not heavy duty enough for dry sand and windy conditions and I was too lazy to use sand-filled plastic bottles instead of pegs.) Another factor is the sand was on a bit of a slope so I dug down a bit at the back and used that sand to build up the front, thus making the area flat but the rear is a bit like a trench and also it's not a perfect fit for the tent. Some corners are a bit outside the flat part and the rocks between the skins could slide down a bit, especially when there's some rain, wind, or both. When I added the tent pegs and guy ropes after the first storm, because they weren't very deep, I dug down a little so the pegs would hold better, put a rock on top to weigh them down, and covered them with a pile of packed sand. In some places I may have heaped a bit of sand over the lower edge of the tent wall too. 

I have seen some barn cats that were claimed to be the offspring of female barn cats and a male bobcat (they had bobbed tails). Wikipedia says that there is circumstantial and anecdotal evidence for this, but the note says that the source for that information is unreliable, and the date on the source is 1975. Is there any more recent scientific evidence on whether bobcats can breed with house cats? 

After answering this question, I am wondering when it would be useful to cook with a solar stove. It certainly wouldn't make sense in an area that is constantly overcast or when speed is of the essence but there are probably times when it would. Personally, I like the idea of not having to carry my fuel if possible so what times/places would it make sense to use a solar stove? 

Based on this list of turtles in Massachusetts, and this one as well as the pointed nose and the jagged back shell, I am going to say that this is a common snapping turtle. For more information I would suggest Wikipedia. It a good thing that you husband didn't touch it, because they are capable of biting (link has gross picture).
