Everything depends if the employee actually was stupid enough to tell that e was fired. normally there is no reason to disclose the fact that somebody was fired at all. If it comes to light in the team that he was fired then the only explanation should be that keeping him in the team would not have been good for the team, together with the instruction not to speculate about the details. 

I have a situation here with a manager (he and me report to the same person) who is responsible for certain aspects with a customer (he is sales, i am a technical team lead). More often than not in the recent months he claims (and insists) that something is settled with the customer, and I later find out that it is not. I do so because I am on-site at the customer, and he isn't and the customer holds me responsible. An typical example is that when new people are added to the team, it would be his responsibility to do the necessary agreements about starting dates and permissions to work on-site with the customer, but we now have the 4th or 5th occasion when the new person arrives without doing so. It starts to impact the customers image of my employer negatively and affect my time severly (additionally to dealing with something which was his job, I have to do so unprepared, immediately, and very often take additional steps). My options are to 

In big companies in Germany sometimes the big picture gets lost. Some of the interviewers don't show the right respect since they believe that they have more than enough applications. However, some of the things could be explained: 

Good to note: This company has very low average wages, and is in the U.S. TL:DR: New project that I'm being put under a lot of pressure to do. I'm asked to perform full-stack developer duties as a low-paid data analyst. I feel abused at my current benefit level with the stress I'm under. It's not acceptable to ask about wage increases at this company, I need a way to effectively negotiate for a merit increase. 

Short historical summary: I've been programming at my current job for ~ 10 months now, I've setup QA, scheduling, adherence tracking, roster, and data pulling/warehousing/reporting for anything else that we needed in a callcenter environment. However, I've always been a "Team Lead" by title, while my superiors expect me to perform programming/data analyst duties. I will even get regular requests pull data from a new vendor and generate reports, or to add features to some tools to meet the needs of a different group. I was even offered the position, which was then rescinded due to it not being in the budget. This came with the difficulties of getting access to tools/data/sites that I need, which often required intervention from my boss's boss as I was just a Team Lead to anyone that I had not met before. For me this was a means to an end and I need to experience so I've went along with it. Meat of the issue: Recently, more and more sites have been blocked due to the restrictive firewall any call center would be expected to have. I've put in tickets to unblock necessary sites that house documentation on the tools/languages I am using. All of my tickets were recently denied. The majority of documentation for the tools and languages I am using as well as other resources such as stackoverflow have been blocked by the firewall. The decision was handed down by individuals very much disconnected from the program, or from the problems I run into when I cannot access developer documentation. The reason I recieved from them was: "This is not quite the direction that we want from your role within the program". I feel like I'm fighting to do the job I'm simultaneously expected to do. My work greatly benefits the colleagues, supervisors, and program managers in my center. It does very little for high-level management outside of the center as it's hard to quantify money saved through less wasted time on a monthly or quarterly report. How can I move forward with this? Do I continue fighting harder and harder to keep things running, or just stop and let it fall apart and hope for the best? I'm still getting requests for features, changes, and new reports from people who us them. Edit: I want to clarify: I don't think I'm 'hot stuff', I just landed into a company that has no internal toolings of any sort (~1500 employees). I was in an ideal position to start developing, a thousand problems to solve and the freedom to pick and choose and do anything I could to solve them. 

She: getting drunk, hitting you and lying about it He: Hugging a drink female colleague and hitting you and lying about it You: Making some joke instead of leaving them alone 

Reasoning: The management dealt with it as it saw it fit. Trying to deal with something which is your managers business against your managers wishes is inacceptable for a senior employee. I think the manager should do the following: 

Personal/private mobile numbers which are read on the weekend or will disturb anybodies dinner or family life are only for emergencies, which require immediate attention. Using these for anything which can wait is nonprofessional. Using these for indicating how important your concern about your coworker is, is plainly inappropriate. For your own sake, seek an advisors help. 

I would not do such a thing. I would not ask, and if i would be asked, i would not answer and potentially inform my former employer. Rationale behind:"how do we negotiate?" is actually more critical than pricing information. "How do we negotiate" involves the information whom you have to address to influence the decision. 

Let me give some male perspective (i am male, 42y, Physics PHD, experience in subjects, broadly positioned, and within the subjects which i followed as PHD/postdoc probably within the top 5% - just to indicate that my self-confidence is ok) 

While i am also not a friend of some HR people trying to act like they could asses how smart a candidate is by such questions, just let them play theirs games, they are probably aware that the question is well known. 

Very careful - dangerous ground - for one of your contacts acknowledging such a goal, you need to be friends, and they need to like risks. Could be much easier to found your own company together and after a decent time change to another company, under your own responsibility. Taking over teams from other companies without their consent may not sit well with the original employer - when a single employee leaves it's very difficult to argue that he "can take away a customer with him". If a team leaves and take customer contacts, projects etc. with them, the original employer will make very sure that they do not take any IP with them developed when they were still employed. Be prepared to walk out naked - no codebase, fewer customers, and possibly an HR-related lawsuit on your back. 

I work as a Data Analyst & Developer at a call center. TL:DR: New boss did not pay attention to existing tools or processes, went off and pushed new processes that replaced existing ones, in an inefficient manner without communicating the need for those changes to the floor or myself (who implemented the existing processes and tools). I was transferred to a new hire, a director, and was immediately put on a leash, and treated as if I've just been wasting company time going off and doing my own thing. Later being told that she (new boss) was told I have an issue with going off and doing random stuff without permission, need, or planning. However, I have not created a single new tool or process since any of the new management has been hired. How can I deal with this? 

To start, I work as a Data Analyst/Web Developer in a callcenter. I sit in the corner of the building, on the call center floor. Company culture and policy describes a very lax dress code, where wearing casual and comfortable clothes is actively encouraged over more formal wear. My superiors and coworkers often wear street clothes to work, a few of them regularly wear shorts as the building can get a bit hot sometimes due to a lack of thermostat control. My new boss, a lady late in her career, who has been very motivational and helpful. Told our new team that she expects us to properly present ourselves. Which means no casual clothing, we need to wear pants and a collared shirt. The reason is that we will periodically be in meetings with company executives and other high-level leadership, that she expects her team to stand out and be presentable. During this meeting, I said that I would be more than willing to wear business casual clothing when in the executive offices or when attending scheduled meetings with executives. But that I get hot easily in the company buildings, and would much rather work while comfortable than not. She effectively shot me down and the meeting ended. Today, we had a 1x1, and she said that she considered my comment on her clothing policy insubordination, that I was being selfish, and need to stop thinking about just my own wants. Along with how I'm being selfish to ask for a double-wide desk because I can't fit my work equipment on the 2.5ft wide cubicle I currently am at... I was unable to eloquently describe why I don't want to wear business casual clothing while sitting in a back corner programming all day, she was very effective at turning what I was saying back around at me. In the end I almost felt like a petulant child with how I was being treated. 

After thinking for some time, I probably would answer: yes, but that would only be money and not fix the long-term career prospects, for which I want to leave. 

I think if the company culture is in right, then they guy already damaged himself by showing how unprofessional he is in front of the whole company, and the biggest damage to him is plainly saying nothing about it - he made himself look like an idiot not suited for the job - and everybody else look professional by going over the issue. If the company culture is not right, there is no point to make in the company by any "witty responses". Witty responses are good to point thing to people who accidentally stumble and draw the wrong conclusions and they are best for things in small circles. If you want to piss him off (anonymously! I advise against it! - also make sure about the legal situation - I am not a lawyer!): I am sure there is a presentation style in your company about values and mottos etc, and sometimes these things are put up as motivational wall decoration. Take this style and make an additional one (optically as close as possible to the original): "We are all glad that you speak French now, it's very sexy (name of the guy, date)" Stick it over some of the motivational wall decoration close to his office and see how long it takes until it's removed. 

You could ask your boss (in general, in a "who is actually responsible if our service is used as part of something illegal" way) to put up a note that customers take responsibility against the company for making sure that they do transmit money only to legitimate recipients, and put up some examples of scam/illegal behavior.
