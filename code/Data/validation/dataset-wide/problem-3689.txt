A 2004 article from The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association, Sternocleidomastoid syndrome: A case study followed the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with your symptoms. The study found that posture may play a part in the occurrence of symptoms, and, exercises were recommended for that. Additionally, during a 4 week treatment phase, the following exercise modality was used: 

Motivation can also come from a training partner. Find someone that has similar health and fitness goals. Choose someone that can encourage you even when you don't want to exercise. 

What you are describing is a pretty common occurrence. Couple that with how easy the body adapts to physical stress (ie. weight training) and the result is the dreaded training plateau. One of the best ways to maintain performance and possibly improve is to not let your body adapt to the physical demands placed on it. You can accomplish that by occasionally changing the reps, sets, and order of exercises. Variety is important in making strength gains. 

However, each of us react differently to the stress. Some may reach a training plateau where gains are few or non-existent. While others, with the same stress, can continue to make improvements. That’s why it’s important to recognize a plateau and make the necessary changes to continue improving. The key is to always challenge your body. That may take the form of increasing the intensity, or, changing the order of exercises, sets, and reps. In my experiences, once a plateau has been reached, I try to take a week off to recharge and refocus my efforts. My goal is to come back with a fresh approach to my training. So, to answer your question, adaptation is real and should not derail your training progress if you recognize it and make the appropriate changes. 

Most fitness facilities train their staff to help new members on becoming acclimated with their facility. A few provide personal trainers (sometimes at a fee) to assist you in obtaining your goals. You should not feel awkward seeking out assistance from a “coach”. Especially if you are new to fitness training. Unfortunately, there are some clubs that do not provide this as a new member orientation. If your club does not, I recommend you seek out someone to assist you in using the equipment. If, for nothing else, the assistance you receive can help you avoid injuries from improper use of the equipment. It's important for someone new to learn proper technique. And, learning how to use new equipment will provide more opportunities for you to reach your goals. After some a period of orientation, you should feel comfortable enough to train on your own. That does not mean that you can't ask for assistance in the future. If you're unsure about anything in the gym, you should seek out someone for assistance. If no one is willing to help, it may be time to seek a new gym. 

I’ll preface this by saying that I am not a runner. However, like you, I am an endurance athlete who competes as a rower. I race two different distances: 1000 meters (sprint, or, side by side) and 5000 meters (“head race”). My goals are the same – improve speed over a specified distance thus finishing quicker. And, like you, I utilize heart rate training. Early on in my racing pre-season, my coach often has us tested for individual Lactate levels while performing a specified rowing “piece” (ie. distance). We then adapt our training to our individual VO2 Max limits based on the Lactate testing. A valid assumption would be to constantly train at VO2 Max levels. However, in the long run, this would be detrimental as it leads to constant exhaustion. Instead, we train in intervals. That is, mixing shorter bouts of higher intensity training, with rest periods, allows us to train closer to 100% VO2 Max levels before reaching total exhaustion. So, to answer your question, I’d suggest you take a look at mixing in some VO2 max interval training. If for nothing else, this type of training should provide a spark to elicit better results from your running. 

Instead, I would first have you look at body part prioritization. By training a lagging body part first in your sessions, you should have plenty of energy to attack that body part. Simply rearranging your routine may also help to force new growth as the body will need to adapt to a newer sequence of exercises. I know you've indicated that you are not interested in isolation movements, but, I think you're missing an opportunity to really fine tune specific muscle groups. Rather than doing only compound movements, I would suggest you mix in isolation movements as well. Granted, there's more bang for your buck with compound movements, but, isolation movements allow you to segregate the work load so that you can target a specific muscle group. When thinking of isolation movements, I think back to Arnold Schwarzenegger comparing himself to a sculptor in Pumping Iron. Arnold offered that a bodybuilder is like a sculptor because he looks in the mirror and decides what body part is lacking and performs specific exercises to improve that body part. In terms of aesthetic improvement, I would definitely suggest you look to mix in isolation movements. If you're still unsure about isolation movements, I would have you take a look at "A comparison of strength and muscle mass increases during resistance training in young women", a study that compared compound movements with isolation movements. The study showed that isolation movements may help with strength and hypertrophy gains. 

One of the most common mistakes made by those looking to lose weight is underestimating calorie consumption. That typically takes the form of underestimating portion size. In its simplistic form, losing weight is a matter of consuming less calories than you expend. Yet, how can you ensure that's happening if you guess at what you are eating? You may think you've consumed no more than 1500 calories, but, have you really? One of the easiest ways of making sure your diet is true is to record what you eat and drink in a journal, or, a spreadsheet. Using an inexpensive calorie counting table will provide you with the information you need to get a better approximation for the calories you are consuming. Updating your journal on a regular basis over a few weeks should shed some light on what you're actually consuming. In addition, the journal will provide you with the data you need to make any adjustments to your diet. Having this knowledge will go a long way in assisting you in your weight loss goals. 

If you look at the shape and function(s) of the traps, I think it’s apparent that rolling the shoulders does not provide any extra benefit, or, activation of the target muscles. 

So, belts may help prevent injury to the low back during heavy lifts and can increase performance from the stabilization they provide. On the negative side, however, using a belt may inhibit motor learning in the abdominal muscles as well as reducing the opportunity for the lower back to get stronger. 

I don't think so. Building mass (naturally) is a long term process. You shouldn't feel like it was a “wasted session”. The fact that you recognized the importance of sleep should provide an incentive in the future to follow through on it. 

I'll preface this by saying this is purely my opinion based on many years of training and experience as a trainer. I, personally, would not perform “one more set with heavy weight stretching my pectorals as long as I can “ after 4 sets of regular flyes. Assuming hard work with heavy weights, your shoulders and pectoral muscles will be pretty exhausted. Adding heavy weight and holding the stretch as long as you can, will force your shoulders and pectorals to counteract the force of gravity. This could leave you susceptible to strains and tears of the pectoral, and, rotator cuff injuries. 

EDIT: G_H's comment reminded me that there's an additional way to record your progress with the C2 rower. Some of their PM's are equipped with Bluetooth capabilities. If you load their app on your phone, you can track your workouts to the phone and upload them later from the same app. 

If your goal is a balanced, aesthetic physique, then, “more is not necessarily better”. Hypertrophy is a very individual thing. There’s no specific set of exercises that will guarantee you growth for a specific muscle group. While exercise selection does contribute to muscle growth, I think it’s much more important to examine your approach to training. Ask yourself, “Is my training approach optimum for making muscular gains?”. You need to understand that you build muscular size when you optimize your nutrition, sleep, and recovery. If one facet of your training is “off”, chances are, you will not make gains. Closely examining each of these should provide insight into any potential areas that are lacking. If you feel that you’re training optimally, there is one change that may be effective for you. If you feel that a particular body part is lagging, you should take a look at prioritizing your routine. An excerpt from the National Strength and Conditioning Association indicates that 

Your question assumes that each blood type offers a different capacity to carry oxygen. Without going into scientific explanations, the easiest way to answer the question is to understand the role of Hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein that serves as a transport mechanism to deliver oxygen to the body tissues. VO2Max is a measurement of how quickly the body consumes that oxygen. While there are factors that can impact Hemoglobin's ability to carry oxygen (ie. disease and environment), blood type is not one of them. That's because blood types refer to the protein on the surface of the red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a solution inside the red blood cell membrane. Think of it in terms of a rubber water balloon. The rubber would be the membrane and the water is the hemoglobin. Blood types are properties of the membrane. The hemoglobin (inside) is the same regardless of the outer (protein) blood type. As such, the blood type is not a factor in VO2Max because it does not influence oxygen transport. 

As a former Bodybuilder, I can relate to the comment by your trainer. His comment reflects one of the theories that was prevalent years ago. As Bodybuilding and Weight training evolved, there have been many advances in training theory. Some of the theories that we thought were valid are no longer the norm. With respect to getting more defined, I can tell you from anecdotal evidence that I found that maintaining the same number of reps and weight while tightening up my nutrition is what works for me. This seems to be borne out by a University of Alabama study, High Reps vs. Low Reps for Fat Loss: 

Assuming you mean weight (resistance) training when you say “Gym”, you're actually comparing two somewhat different, but, complimentary activities. So, if at all possible, why not do both? As Alec states, your worry about a “gym body” is unfounded for the reasons he lists. However, that should not discourage you from participating in an exercise program to add/improve muscle mass since studies have shown that there are numerous advantages to building a base of muscle. Also keep in mind that muscle is metabolically active, thus assisting in the burning of unwanted calories. In fact, a recent study found Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) was indeed lower for those individuals with lower amounts of mass:
