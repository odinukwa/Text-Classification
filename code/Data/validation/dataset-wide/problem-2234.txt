This would be frowned upon as far as "unwritten rules" go, and someone would probably get hit by a pitch as a result. I haven't seen it happen, but it could be a strategy against a good hitter in a big game (ie- playoffs, world series, etc). 

In the NHL the only position that a woman would stand a chance physically is at goaltender. @jerepierre has already touched on this. In soccer the women could match up with the average size according to the business insider article, but the men would be superior in athletic abilities such as jumping and sprinting. Women would have the best chance in the MLB as a knuckle ball or junk ball pitcher. To do this they wouldn't necessarily have to be athletic or big. They would need to perfect their craft of being a junk baller. This would also obviously lead to other issues besides talent, but as John Kruk once said, Lady, I'm not an athlete. I'm a professional baseball player. 

I have a background playing baseball, and pine tar is used all the time along with variations of tape to get a grip on the bat. I was at a Colorado Avalanche game and wondered if the players use pine tar or another tacky substance for a better grip. I know that the bottom hand on the stick moves pretty freely, so I wouldn't expect a player to use it on that hand. The top hand is pretty stationary to my knowledge, and they use tape on the top of the stick. Do players put anything on the tape for more grip like a baseball player might? 

According to the NBA section of this Investopedia article, each season there is a "playoff kitty" which is divvied up amongst the various teams dependent on performance, from which the teams can choose how to distribute amongst players. Here's the exact quotes: 

Yes. Law 18 of Cricket makes no mention that the bat has to accompany the player for a run to be completed, simply that the batsman has to be grounded. 

I expect that the umpire would signal "time on" on giving a free kick before the centre bounce, but even if they didn't, the timekeeper is able to do it of their own accord because the football is clearly in play at that point. At this stage the match is in the same state it would have been even if there was a centre bounce - the match has started, the ball is in play, and the timekeeper has started the clock. 

Additionally, playoff pool distribution amongst teams may not be even. As explained on wagesofwins.com, teams can distribute the money however they like - so I'd imagine that the "big name" star players will get a disproportionately large share of it. That said, If you look at the bottom of that article, if the pool was distributed fairly, making the playoffs only results in a $7,760 payout per player - so not a massive incentive. You have to make the NBA Finals to get a really large bonus. 

I can't find any players who strictly meet this criteria, but Cristiano Ronaldo certainly has a case for it. He jointly holds the record for goals scored in a 38-game Premier League season (31 goals in 2007–08), as well as having held the record for the most goals scored in La Liga, with 40 in 2010–11 (albeit only for a solitary year, as Lionel Messi scored 50 the very next season). I specify a "38-game Premier League season" because in the early to mid 1990s, two players (Andy Cole and Alan Shearer) scored 34 goals in a single season, but they had 42 games to do this in. The Premier League officially acknowledges both of these totals as records, which means that if you found a stats book from 2011 listing the record number of goals scored in any individual season for every top-flight league, Cristiano Ronaldo's name will probably appear twice. 

I was watching the LA Kings vs San Jose Sharks game tonight and saw something I hadn't see or realized before. There was a face-off in one of the defensive zones. The referee fake the puck drop and the players came together, the referee in the neutral zone blew his whistle (I am assuming to indicate an infraction). Instead of throwing a guy out of the face-off, the linesman held up his pointer finger indicating a "1" and showed it to the referee that blew the whistle. The face-off went on as usual, but I hadn't seen that before. My questions are: 

Looking at stats from the 2013... Richard Sherman had 8 interceptions. The leader in fumbles recovered was Mychal Kendricks with 4. The leader in forced fumbles was Robert Mathis with 10. It is tough to track because interceptions are a turnover, where forced fumbles may not be a turnover. I cannot find stats on individual turnovers created. There are team turnover differentials, but not stats for an individual (or position). I would conclude that defensive backs, and more specifically corner backs create the most turnovers based on the stats available. Especially in today's NFL which is a passing league. 

I have to correct something: On a balk there is no ball issued if there are runners on base and it is not a violation of doctoring the ball. If it is a violation of doctoring the ball, Wax Eagle is correct. Most of the time (not always) a balk has to do with the pitcher having trouble with the "set position" (ie not coming all the way set, coming set in an illegal way, etc.). All runners advance one base. There are a few things about a balk depending on the situation: 

As explained here on the ITF Tennis website, you're pretty much right. There's two different "types" of grades, A, B, and C, as well as 1-5. Grades A, B, and C represent different types of competitions as follows: 

No, the NBA team can not pay a player less than his contract due to injury. They can, however, get a salary cap extension under the Disabled Player Extension, as detailed: 

This has happened a few times in the AFL, and play continues as it would for any other free kick, as a centre bounce isn't strictly required to start a quarter. This isn't very explicit in the rules, but there is one fairly convenient "out" clause. First off, the start of the match is defined as being when the siren goes to start the quarter, not when the ball is bounced. So if a player gives away a free kick in that time period, it doesn't matter that the ball hasn't yet been bounced, as the match is already underway and the free will be given. As for the clock starting, although the rule of thumb is generally that time starts when the ball is bounced as per 10.5.2(b), there's two alternatives that can apply here: 

A let is basically a stroke that, due to some variety of circumstances, is counted as "void" and the point is completely replayed. The specific scenario you're referring to is when the first bounce of the ball in a rally lands outside of the area of play. It's not noted in the source you've provided, but it's also a let under the same rule if the ball manages to lodge itself in the court somehow, as opposed to bouncing naturally. 

Which was 4th in the division, or second to last. Link to odds When it comes to the two teams playing in the worlds series, I would imagine that would be hard/impossible to find. It would most likely be an individual bet, which I cannot find or haven't heard of. However the odds of each team winning their pennant are published in the same document. 

This scenario in the rule book pertains to your situation. Basically the penalty is enforced from the spot of the foul and the offense keeps the ball with a couple exceptions: 

Intentional Walk I know that there have been times where a pitcher has thrown a ball over the plate enough for a hitter to get a hit, and even hit a home run in some cases. My question is more along the lines of: If he throws one over the plate and in the strike zone, and the hitter does not swing, is it a strike? Is there anything in the rule book saying that a catcher cannot deke the hitter by standing up and signaling for an intentional walk and then having the pitcher throw a strike? 

The play unfolds as a play action power run with the halfback, the full back shows block and continues into the flat and is the primary receiver. The secondary receiver is the tight end (Y receiver). 

Here is a link that explains kicking from scrimmage (field goals and punts). The main things to understand which apply to your question are: 

I understand that it would be seen as Bush League and often may be noticed by a member of the defense or an umpire. However, it could be a way to sneak a better scoring opportunity if there are no repercussions. 

Grades 1-5 are basically the same as the ATP/WTA GS/1000/500/250 system - a Grade 5 event is worth the least points, and a Grade 1 event is worth the most. Grade A events are always worth more than Grade 1 events, but Grade B events are generally denoted with something like "B2", which means that it's a regional championship worth slightly more than a Grade 2 event. Similarly, B1 events are worth slightly more than Grade 1s (but less than Grade As), and B3 events are worth more than Grade 3s, but less than Grade 2s. There are currently no Grade B events lower than B3. To be on the end-of-year rankings a junior player must have played in three Grade A events. 

I can't speak specifically for the NFL, but this does actually happen regularly in a lot of leagues. Since the 2000s, Carlton and Adelaide in the AFL, as well as Melbourne Storm in the NRL, have both been punished for salary cap cheating in this form. The main thing stopping it is the punishment (Melbourne Storm were retroactively stripped of all of their premierships in that period and fined millions of dollars), which often far outweighs any advantages. For instance, Carlton were fined nearly a million dollars and stripped of all of their draft picks for two years, and then proceeded to be the worst team in the competition for most of that decade. The Adelaide Crows were fined nearly half a million dollars, were also stripped of two years of draft picks, lost arguably their best player in a trade to another team without receiving the compensation they otherwise would have, and had a number of players leave in quick succession, possibly due to the scandal. They went from being one of the best teams in the competition in 2012 to being a laughing stock. Melbourne Storm, in the most infamous salary cap breach in Australian sporting history, had paid roughly $1,000,000 a year to their players outside of the cap, with "off the books" things like payments into offshore accounts, $20,000 gift cards, and boats. They were fined millions, had two of their premierships (and three minor premierships) removed, and were also stripped of their World Club Challenge champions title. In short, yes, rorting the salary cap is very easy, and many people and many teams have done it. The thing stopping it from become extraordinarily common is that a sports club has so much scrutiny under it, and so many people who need to be kept quiet, and in the end, the punishment if you get caught means that it just isn't worth it.
