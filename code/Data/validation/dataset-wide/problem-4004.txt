Kanovei and Shelah surprisingly managed to prove the existence of a ZFC-definable (i.e., specifiable via an explicit ZFC construction) nonstandard model of the reals. The existence of a nonstandard model of the reals is known to require a version of AC. 

There is probably terminology for this, and I apologize that I don't know it, and part of my question is what the standard terminology for the concepts I'm giving is. This is a pretty open-ended question. Let $C$ be some class of random variables, on the the same or different probability spaces, taking values in some topological space $V$ (the case that interests me most is $R^\omega$). Let $D_C$ be the set of distributions of the variables in $C$, i.e., equivalence classes under probability isomorphism ($X:\Omega\to V$ and $Y:\Upsilon\to V$ are equivalent iff there is a probability isomorphism $\alpha:\Omega\to\Upsilon$ such that $X = Y\circ \alpha$). Say that $C$ is "single-point recoverable" provided that there is a function $f:V\to D_C$ such that for every $X\in C$, $f(X)=[X]$ with probability one. I.e., for all $X\in C$, if $X:\Omega\to V$, then $f(X(\omega)) = [X]$ for almost all $\omega\in\Omega$. Question 1: Is there a standard term for "single-point recoverable"? Fact: If $V=\mathbb R^\infty$ (with product topology and a Borel $\sigma$-algebra) and $C_n$ is the class of all vector-valued random variables $X$ of the form $X=(X_i)_{i\in \mathbb N}$ where the $X_i$ are i.i.d. and have values in $R^n$, then $C_n$ is single-point recoverable. (Proof sketch: Rectangles are a Vapnis-Chervonenkis class, and we can a.s. recover the distribution of $X_1$, and hence of $X$, via a uniform strong LLN by using the frequencies of visits of $X_i(\omega)$ to rectangles.) Question 2: Is there a standard name for the Fact? An elementary proof? (I may be missing something completely obvious.) (The Fact is a sort of partial vindication of frequentism: It shows that if we know that an infinite sequence of observations was generated by an i.i.d. sequence, a.s. we can recover the distribution from the observations.) Question 3: Are there any interesting generalizations of the Fact? For instance, if $E$ is the class of all sequences of $\mathbb R^n$-valued i.r.v.'s, then $E$ isn't single-point recoverable. But is there any result like this: There is a function $f:\mathbb R^\infty \to D_C$ such that for all $X\in E$, for almost all $\omega$, $f(X(\omega))$ is "asymptotically close" to $[X]$, in some precise sense? (Or at least for some subclass of $E$.) Is there any result that weakens independence? 

Let $C$ be the Cantor middle-thirds set. Let $\mu$ be a finitely-additive isometrically-invariant measure on all subsets of $\mathbb R$. Then $\mu(3C)=2\mu(C)$, where $aB = \{ ax : x \in B \}$. Thus if $a$ is a power of $3$, $\mu(aC) = a^{\log_3 2} \mu(C)$. Question 1: Is it the case for all $a\in (0,\infty)$ that $\mu(aC)=a^{\log_3 2} \mu(C)$, if $\mu$ is a finitely-additive isometrically-invariant measure on $\mathcal P\mathbb R$? The remaining questions are predicated on an affirmative answer, though currently I'm suspecting a negative answer to 1. Question 2: Is this still true if isometric-invariance is replaced by translation-invariance? Question 3: Has there been any work on using the the relationship between $\mu(aC)$ and $\mu(C)$ for invariant measures $\mu$ on $\mathbb R^n$ (perhaps not defined on all of the powerset, but just on the Borel sets) to define a dimension and comparing it to Hausdorff and box dimensions? 

It's been a while since I've worked with amenable groups and integrals against finitely additive measures, so I could be missing something, but it now seems to me that the question is easy. While apparently in general the direct product of amenable groups isn't amenable, the direct product of abelian groups is of course amenable. So we can use: Theorem. If $G$ is the direct product of the groups $(G_i)_{i\in I}$ and $G$ is amenable, then there is a finitely additive invariant measure on $G$ that has independence for finite sequences of events depending respectively on pairwise disjoint sets of coordinates. We need only prove the Theorem for finite sets $I$. For let $F$ be the set of finite partitions of $I$, with a partial order given by $K\le L$ iff $L$ is at least as fine as $K$. For any partition $K\in F$, we consider $G$ to be the product of the $G^A=\prod_{i\in A} G_i$ as $A$ ranges over $K$. The measure we get from the finite index-set case of the theorem applied to the product of the $G^A$ will satisfy the independence condition for finite sequences of events depending on pairwise disjoint sets of coordinates that are in the algebra generated by $K$. Now, choose an ultrafilter on $F$, and let $\mu$ be the pointwise limit of $\mu_K$ along the ultrafilter. Then $\mu$ is the requisite measure on $G$. The finite index-set case follows by iterating: Lemma: If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are groups with finitely additive invariant measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, then there is a finitely addditive invariant measure $\mu$ on their direct product such that $\mu(A\times B)=\mu_1(A)\mu_2(B)$. Proof of Lemma: Let $\mu(U) = \int_{G_2} \mu_1 ( \{ x_2 : (x_1,x_2) \in U \} ) d\mu_2(x_2)$. Integrals against f.a. measures are additive so $\mu$ is a f.a. measure, and invariance is obvious. 

Does FCU imply BPI? Does Hahn-Banach imply FCP? (In the first version of this post I said that I thought I had a proof. But there was a mistake in it.) Does FCP imply Hahn-Banach? 

It is consistent with ZFC (but not ZFC+CH, of course) that there is a subset $A$ of nonzero outer Lebesgue measure that has cardinality less than $c$. There will then be an extension of Lebesgue measure that assigns non-zero measure to $A$ and there will be a translation-invariant extension of Lebesgue measure that assigns zero measure to $A$ (since there is an extension that assigns zero to all sets of cardinality less than $c$, using the uncountable cofinality of $c$ and the fact that any such set has null inner measure). Question: Is it consistent with ZFC that there be a translation-invariant extension of Lebesgue measure that assigns nonzero measure to some set of cardinality less than $c$? If yes, then it will be consistent with ZFC that there be a translation-invariant extension of Lebesgue measure which has a set of null measure whose complement has cardinality less than $c$, which will be rather amusing, I think. (There are two kinds of proofs I've seen of the fact that every set of nonzero Lebesgue measure has cardinality $c$. One kind depends on there being a closed subset of nonzero measure and then a bunch of bisections. That won't work for extensions of Lebesgue measure. The other kind depends on the continuity of convolutions of characteristic functions, which then depends on the $L^1$-continuity of translation, which then depends on approximation by characteristic functions of intervals, and that won't work either.) 

Tarski proved that if a group $G$ is exponentially bounded, then for $a$, $b$ and $c$ in the associated (equidecomposability) type semigroup, we have $a+c=b+2c \Rightarrow a=b+c$. Question: Can this Tarski condition on the type semigroup be proved if one replaces "exponentially bounded" with "supramenable"? (I assume it's still not known if all supramenable groups are exponentially bounded.) Update: Given Choice, this Tarski condition implies supramenability: If $(m+1)c\le mc$ for $m\in\mathbb Z^+$ and non-zero $c$ in the semigroup, then for some $d$, we have $d+(m+1)c=mc$ and iterating the Tarski condition we get $d+c=0$, which is impossible. Thus, $(m+1)c\not\le mc$, and if $c=[A]$ then that's what's needed for Tarski's Theorem to yield a $G$-invariant measure that assigns $1$ to $A$. (This gives an alternate proof of Rosenblatt's result that exponential boundedness implies supramenability.) So the question is basically whether the Tarski condition is equivalent to supramenability. Mark Sapir asked for some definitions, which I originally put in the comments but now am moving here: 

Here's the proof. The answer to Question 1 follows by letting $G$ be the subgroup of permutations generated by $f$. (By the way, I assume that your no-finite-orbits condition really means: no finite orbits of size greater than one. Fixed points aren't a problem.) 

Some miscellaneous notes: A. FCP immediately implies the following Probabilistic Choice principle: (PC) For any set-valued function $f$ on a set $X$ such that $f(x)$ is always non-empty, there is a function $g$ on $X$ such that $g(x)$ is a probability on $f(x)$. PC is strong enough to imply both the existence of Lebesgue nonmeasurable sets and the Banach-Tarski paradox (the Foreman-Wehrung and Pawlikowski proofs of these things from Hahn-Banach basically only use PC). I don't know if PC is weaker than FCP nor if it's weaker than HB. B. Analogously, FCU implies the following Ultrafilter Choice principle: (UC) For any set-valued function $f$ on a set $X$ such that $f(x)$ is always non-empty, there is a function $g$ on $X$ such that $g(x)$ is an ultrafilter on $f(x)$. UC does not imply FCU, because Form 344 does not imply Form 30 (linear orderability), while FCU implies linear orderability (see point D). UC, and hence FCU, immediately implies Choice for families of finite sets. According to Howard and Rubin, it is unknown whether UC implies HB. C. FCU is equivalent to there being a function $u$ that assigns to each non-empty subset $A$ of $\Omega$ an ultrafilter $u(A)$ with $A\in u(A)$ and the coherence property that if $A\subseteq B$ and $A\in u(B)$, then $u(A)=u(B)$. D. FCU implies that the order extension principle: every partial order extends to a linear order. To see this, note that replacing each element of the poset by the set of all elements less than or equal to it, we can suppose the partial order is setwise inclusion. Let $\Omega$ be any set and let $P$ be full conditional ultrafilter probabilities on the subsets of $\Omega$. Then define $A \preceq B$ for $A,B\subseteq\Omega$ iff $A=B$ or $P(A-B|A\Delta B) \le P(B-A|B\Delta A)$. This is a total order extending set inclusion. E. Any well-ordered set $\Omega$ is such that there a principal ultrafilter full conditional probability on $2^\Omega$: just let $P(B|A)=1$ iff $\min A \in B$. Conversely, if all the conditional probabilities are principal, then the order given by $a\le b$ iff $P(\{a\} | \{a,b\})=1$ is a well-order. Therefore, FCU implies that every non-well-orderable set has a nonprincipal ultrafilter, which implies that some set has a nonprincipal ultrafilter. F. Amusingly, every amorphous set has a full conditional probability. Just let $P(A|B) = 1$ if $A\cap B$ is infinite and $P(A|B)=|A\cap B|/|B|$ otherwise. 

A probability is a finitely additive measure on a boolean algebra with total measure $1$. A function $P:\scr B \times (\scr B - \{ 0 \})$ is a full conditional probability on $\scr B$ (for a boolean algebra $\scr B$) iff $P(-|A)$ is a probability for all $A$ and $P(A|B)P(B|C)=P(A|C)$ whenever $A\le B\le C$. Identify an ultrafilter with a $\{0,1\}$-valued probability. The consider these two claims: FCP: For any nonempty $\Omega$ there is a full conditional probability $P$ on $2^\Omega$. FCU: for any nonempty $\Omega$, there is a full conditional probability $P$ on $2^\Omega$ with every $P(-|A)$ being an ultrafilter. Then I think I can show that BPI$\Rightarrow$FCU$\Rightarrow$FCP. Questions: 

Given AC, is there a probability measure $\mu$ on $2^{[0,1]}$ and a translation-invariant extension $\lambda$ of Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ such that: for all permutations $\pi$ of $[0,1]$ and all Lebesgue measurable $B\subseteq[0,1]$, for $\mu$-almost all $A\subseteq [0,1]$, we have $\pi[A]$ $\lambda$-measurable and $\lambda(\pi[A]\cap B)=(1/2)\lambda(B)$? If not, what if we drop "translation-invariant" and/or "$\lambda(\pi[A]\cap B)=(1/2)\lambda(B)$"? (OK, that's three questions, then.) 

The Tarski condition $a+c=b+2c\Rightarrow a=b+c$ is equivalent to supramenability, given AC. Proof: First, note that the Tarski condition on the type space $S=S(G)/G$ is easily equivalent to the condition that $a+b=2a\Rightarrow a=b$. (This is called strong separativity, I am told.) This is equivalent to the condition that $a=2a\Rightarrow a=0$, which is equivalent to supramenability. One direction of proof is trivial. Now suppose $x=2x\Rightarrow x=0$ for all $x$, and suppose that $a+b=2a$. If $a\le nb$ for some $n\in \mathbb N$, then by Lemma 7.6 of Laczkovich, from $a+a=a+b$ we can conclude $a=b$ and we're done. So suppose that for no $n$ do we have $a\le nb$. Let $\phi:S\to[0,\infty]$ be the homorphism given by $\phi(x)=0$ if $x\le nb$ for some $n$ and $\phi(x)=\infty$ otherwise. Let $\mu:2^G\to[0,\infty]$ be the finitely-additive measure corresponding to $\phi$. By Prop 1.7 of Armstrong (page 7; this uses AC), $\{ \mu \}$ can be extended to a dimensionally complete set $M$ of measures linearly ordered under Renyi order $\prec$, where $\nu\prec\rho$ iff $\nu(A)<\infty\Rightarrow \rho(A)=0$, and a set of measures on $G$ is dimensionally complete iff for each $\varnothing\ne A\subseteq G$ there is a unique $\nu$ in the set such that $\nu(A)\in(0,\infty)$. Let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of $G$ such that $A=\pi[\alpha]$ and $B=\pi[\beta]$ where $a=[\alpha]$ and $b=[\beta]$ and $\pi$ is the projection of $G\times \mathbb N\to \mathbb N$ ($S$ is a set of equivalence classes in a subset of $g\times\mathbb N$). Observe that if $\psi:S\to[0,\infty]$ is a homomorphism and $\nu$ is the corresponding measure on $G$, then $\psi(a)\in(0,\infty)$ iff $\nu(A)\in(0,\infty)$ and the same for $b$ and $B$. Let $\nu\in M$ be such that $\nu(A)\in(0,\infty)$. Note that $\mu(A)=\infty$ as $\phi(a)=\infty$. Thus, $\nu\prec \mu$ is impossible, and they are plainly not equal, so $\mu\prec\nu$. Now, $\mu(B)=0$. Thus, $\nu(B)=0$. Let $\psi:S\to[0,\infty]$ be the homomorphism corresonding to $\nu$. Then $\psi(a)\in(0,\infty)$ and $\psi(b)=0$. But $a+b=2a$ so $\psi(a)+\psi(b)=2\psi(a)$, which is impossible.
