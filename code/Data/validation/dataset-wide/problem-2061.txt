The style used in resumes is more complicated than just dropping the "I" from the sentences. It's not a mechanical transformation like that; it's something more subtle that can be a challenge to explain to a non-native writer of English. Start by writing the resume in complete sentences. Next, look for content-free phrases. For example "I am responsible for writing x" is "I write x", isn't it? You want action-y verbs like write, manage, create more than am, for example. Third, pick a tense - most people use past tense for jobs they have left and present tense for the job they hold at the moment. Fourth, once you have a consistent and compact set of sentences, if the sentence or clause starts with I, which it probably does, just start with the verb. 

You were asked about your supervisor. You chose not to keep a secret for your supervisor. Why? Because you have a lot of honor and integrity and put the company first? If so, be proud of that. Because you were scared of the CEO and he stared at you with piercing CEO eyes and scared the secret out of you? If so, own that too - perhaps you have a chance to learn something here. Because you hadn't thought about the consequences of telling anyone whatever you told? Well own that too and this is definitely a learning experience. 

Use an email client, such as Outlook. Set it to send/receive only when you request it. Now you can open the app to look at emails, without getting new ones. Alternatively, stop using your email as a place to find things. When you get requirements, IP addresses, etc, paste them into a document that you keep on your machine and can read at will. 

Describing it as "too hard" invites them to wonder if you will find this job too hard. Instead, learn to describe it as "a bad fit for my skills". You need to convince not just your interviewers of this attitude, but yourself. Some jobs require tremendous attention to tiny details and keeping mental checklists and never forgetting anything. For some people, that's too hard. Some jobs require lifting up out of tiny details to see the big picture and the sweeping vision. For some people, that's too hard. Some jobs require empathy and compassion and seeing everyone's point of view and always striving for consensus and win-win. For some people, that's too hard. Some jobs require setting aside emotions and personal desires and doing what wins the war or makes the most money or produces the greatest overall gain. For some people, that's too hard. Describing your old job as "too hard" is not helping yourself in the slightest. You need to do some reflection and self examination to find out what specific skills it needed that you either didn't have or didn't like using. Then when asked you can say: 

Without knowing the money you now make, the money that position normally makes, and the qualifications that position has, it is impossible to know this. The mere fact of being sent on course means nothing. For example: 

Do not tell a story that matches the first answer. If you have a story that matches the second answer, get good at telling it. No matter how small the thing, a story where you're the hero is the best. But avoid 

The answer to this depends strongly on your company. However, in many large companies, there are so many people, so many proposed courses of action in any circumstance, and so many decisions to be made, that people rely on shortcuts. One of the most reliable is reputation. Someone might say "Well, if Kate is behind it I think we can be sure it will succeed. She's smart, she works well with others, she communicates well and the last three projects she was on all succeeded. I don't think she'd be involved with this if it was a bad idea." That's so much quicker for them than actually investigating my new project. Your boss wants you to be the subject of a sentence like that in the near future. Partly as an altruistic gesture to help your career in the company. And partly as a selfish gesture to help other projects belonging to your boss. You've done well at something; let's make sure the whole company knows. You're smart enough to be on that committee; get on it and make sure everyone else on it knows you and sees what a winner you are. Some day soon, a decision will roll around that will go the way your boss wants, if only most of the room knows you and how good you are. This will help you and your boss. And yes, your appraisal, but this is a longer term play than this year's review. If you work in a company where visibility matters, you are lucky to have a boss who knows that and will lead you through it. Do not reject that gift because you think you know how companies should work. But on the other hand: there are occasionally little islands of "it's who you know" in a large company, who just schmooze and flatter and make sure they're visible without ever getting anything useful done, without being good or smart or wise. If you have such a boss and the rest of the company hates that, tread very very carefully. This is the rarer case but it can happen. Your best asset here is a friend in another organization of your company who can tell you which kind of situation you are in. 

As an employer, I was generally happy when my staff enjoyed what they did at work so much that they also did it on their own time. This was generally a benefit for me, since they would be learning things without my having to invest in training them. (Sometimes what they were learning was how hard it can be to run a company, which is priceless information I can't otherwise get into people's heads.) You're worried that your boss will not be happy, and you're trying to figure out a defence. I wonder why? Here is what would make me unhappy: 

Imagine you spend $2000 to admit someone to a conference where they are going to learn a ton of great stuff, you spend hundreds on plane tickets, hundreds a night on hotels, restaurants etc, and then you're asked for overtime pay (maybe a week's salary!) as well. Not only is that making the conference very expensive, it's making me feel like I'm the only one who cares about the person going to the conference. Aren't they happy to be learning new things? I have friends who use vacation time to go to conferences, and pay their own ways. The contrast to someone who sees a way to not only be fully paid (salary and expenses) but also later get a full week of extra vacation -- it doesn't look good. If the person is traveling to make us money, then I probably pay them well. Again I don't need to use up whatever profit I make on charging for their time by paying for longer days. It adds up quickly and the margins were always very thin to begin with. Generally most of my staff were not at a level I could send them to a client. The ones I could ... they got paid a lot more already, precisely because they were the ones I could send on their own to make us money. If they didn't want to go without 5 or 10 or 20 hours of overtime pay then fine, they didn't have to go. The smart ones wanted to show they could do that sort of thing - it would serve them well in their career. The people with a shorter term view, who wouldn't go unless there was something in it for them this week, well not sending them generally was just as well. 

To appear happier, the simplest approach is to be happier. And while you may think that's not possible, it is. Your unhappiness appears to stem from two main issues: 

You don't mention your own gender. I know women who have been told by their managers things like, "if you would like to get promoted to manager here, you are going to have to start spending more on your clothes. I recommend doubling your clothes budget and never setting foot in Walmart again." I also know women who've been told to change their hair styles dramatically (eg cut off several feet of it, or grow it six inches longer), get manicures regularly, get their ears pierced, stop wearing large earrings, wear makeup, stop wearing makeup, wear higher heels, wear lower heels, lose weight, and so on. I don't know any men who have told me about being taken aside for these "image coach" moments, though that doesn't mean they don't exist. The thing is, in many cases the boss is not saying "you are not meeting my dress code, change your ways." They are saying "hey, person I would like to see do well, even though we don't have a rule about this, you should know that your choices about your appearance are limiting your options here." Advice like this is essentially impossible to argue with. If you don't follow it, it just keeps coming. If you push back, and tell them that your appearance has no connection to your ability to do the job, you may find yourself moved from the "person I would like to see do well" category into the "arrogant person who thinks they don't need my well-meaning advice" category - not a place you really want to be. My advice to you is this. First and foremost you must apologize. Even if you were right to say whatever you said, the way you said it has upset your boss. Fix that. Second, try to understand whether these comments about posture, unironed blazers, hair and so on fit better into "you are not following our company dress code and your job is in danger" or "I would love to see you get promoted and think these changes could get you there." Of course they could also fit "your mother didn't raise you right, allow me to take over" and I sense that's how you're responding to them. But you need to know for sure how they were meant. Third, thank your boss for taking the time to give you information you clearly needed. Fourth, tell your boss what you are going to do about it from now on. Possibilities include: 

Someone who didn't write the code will bomb these questions totally. Someone who did might still do poorly. You will have a framework and a context for the sorts of questions people love to ask in interviews, while also proving they did the assignment themselves. (A really suspicious or cruel interviewer could ask trick questions, like asking about something that isn't even there, but I wouldn't.) 

This will help give you confidence about the communications that are happening and at the same time, you're planting this tiny seed that "hey boss, when you need to tell me and X to do something, what you actually do is tell X to do it while I stand there feeling small." But you don't say that out loud with your mouth, at least not at the beginning of solving your communications issues with this boss. 

Assuming you want the job, you need to address the 11 day delay and stop discussing rent and what a suitable home is with the person you want to work for. Start by thinking long and hard about whether you could get by on 45. How about 48? Does it have to be 50? Would you rather lose the job than take 48? You must know your own mind on this very clearly. Once you know your price, write back and 

I can easily see two employees who each did all of this, but one chose to highlight say 4 of these bullets and one the other four. They would end up with different reviews. Try to understand what the people reading your report think is important. Timesheets? Process? Learning? Producing? Not screwing up? Helping others? Being visible? Unless you know what they value, you can't write a good review. But once you do, you're all set! 

I blogged about this four years ago. I encourage you to find a genuine weakness in yourself and explain what you need from the company as a result. For example, perhaps you're a streaky worker, someone who gets lit up by a problem and just can't put it down and works till midnight until it's solved. You need an employer that will accomodate that, and give you some time off afterwards so you can rest. Or perhaps you're a little absent minded sometimes. You need an employer that has process, checklists, checks and balances - not one that encourages developers to edit files live on the production server. Maybe you don't like to juggle multiple projects at once and do best with the predictability of long term stable assignments where you know weeks in advance what you'll be doing all day. Or maybe you get bored with that and need a roller coaster of unexpected assignments and fires to put out. In some firms this is a weakness: in some it's a great fit and just what they're looking for. (Woe betide you if you make something up here and end up in a job that's a perfect fit for the rare maverick you pretended to be. Tell the truth.) The ideal weakness that you would write down here would not be a thinly disguised "I am too awesome for mere mortals" but an insightful truth that helps to show why this company is actually perfect for you. It has to come with a companion phrase "and that's why I need an employer that..." - without the second half, you run the risk that they'll interpret your weakness differently. Always close the loop for them. The more confident you are that you have a lot to offer to the right employer, the easier you'll find this question to answer.
