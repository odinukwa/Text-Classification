It is standard approach by now to acknowledge the existence of a "rate of pure time preference", denoted usually by $\rho$, that characterizes individuals. This is a fundamental aspect of preferences - a "primitive" parameter. It is not a proxy for the existence of uncertainty (this is why it is found also in deterministic models), neither does it reflect "economic opportunity costs" (this is why it discounts future utility also). In continuous-time model this discount factor takes the form $e^{-\rho t}$, while in discrete-time models, this discount factor takes the form $\beta = 1/(1+\rho)$. In the individual's intertemporal maximization problem, the interest rate does not enter in the utility/objective function, but in the law of motion of personal wealth. So a negative real interest rate does not reflect on the personal discount rate. Traditionally also, firms are considered to discount the future only with respect to the opportunity cost which in turn is assumed to be reflected in the (real) interest rate $r$. So when modelling the intertemporal problem of a firm we usually see $e^{-r t}$ and $\beta = 1/(1+ r)$. 

By the notation used, labor quantity appears to be constant. Then the only source of growth of output is the growth in $A_N(t)$, and they will have the same growth rate. Take logarithms and then time derivatives on the output per capita equation to see this. Then remember introductory differential equations on how to express $x(t)$ as a function of $x(0)$ and a constant growth rate. And don't forget to explicitly solve for the 10-factor difference required, at the end. 

For stability, we want $$\frac{\partial k_{t+1}}{\partial k_t}\Big|_{\bar k} <1 \implies \frac{(1-\delta) + \sigma A_0 f'(\bar k)}{1+n} <1$$ $$ \implies f'(\bar k) < \frac {\delta+n}{\sigma A_0 } = \frac {f(\bar k)}{\bar k}$$ So we need the marginal product of capital to be smaller than the average product at the steady state. Equivalently, we need $\bar k f'(\bar k) < f(\bar k) \implies f(\bar k)-\bar k f'(\bar k)>0$. And this holds, doesn't it? Otherwise... 

I never understood why discussion about specialized software should be off-topic in the specialty's website. And of course I don't agree. So: Before diving into R, which indeed appears to be the dominant (and rich) freeware for statistical computing, one can try Gretl. It is an Econometrics freeware, with a lot of functionality, a very good Random Number Generator, and has both menu-driven implementation but also code-writing by the user. It is easier for beginners - but it is serious stuff. The wikipedia page for Gretl lists some reviews about Gretl. The other kind of "economics" (not mathematics) software apart from econometrics packages would be specialized simulation software, for say Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models, or micro-applications. For DSGE, one such is Dynare. A lot of DSGE-code for various other software can be found at International Network for DSGE Modeling, Monetary and Fiscal Policy. 

The first question has nothing to do with utility optimization, and so with the utility function. It just determines a bound, and it is the solution to the inequality $$(24-l)\cdot \frac 12 \geq 11$$ since $(24-l)$ represents amount of work in hours. The optimization task is $$\max _{c,l}U(c,l)=c+2l^{1/2} \\$$ $$s.t. \;\;c = (24-l)\cdot \frac 12 -11,\;\; c\geq 0,\;\; l \geq 0$$ Due to the existence of the lump-sum tax, the non-negativity constraints matter. This is why the OP ended up with a negative consumption, because she did not consider the non-negativity constraints. Now instead of going for a formal treatment with non-negative Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multipliers, the first question comes handy. Since there is a maximum amount of leisure at which point the consumer is just able to pay taxes (and so have zero consumption), it follows that the variable "leisure" cannot take a greater value than that, because it will lead to negative consumption. Then one can reason by taking the partial derivatives of the utility function, and wonder "if a decrease leisure a little below its maximum permissible level, what do I lose in terms of utility from leisure lost, and what do I gain in terms of utility in terms of consumption gained?" It will also help to consider the two extremes: What is the utility when leisure is maximum and consumption is zero? What is the utility when leisure is zero and consumption is maximum? Don't forget to pay the (very heavy) taxes first. 

Q2 : Indeed the correct formulation is for initial investment to appear with a minus sign, since it is an outflow. This reflects the position of somebody who contemplates making the investment. Note also that you shuold check whether there exists some residual value of assets at the end of the operational period examined - this should be added (and discounted) together with the net cash flow of the last future period examined. Q1 : the logic of the net present value calculation is to notionally compare the returns of the specific investment with some abstract alternative that pays a constant $r$ per period, as a percentage of value left to produce returns. It is as though we have a bank account from which we draw and to which we deposit. Now think in reverse : in order to "have" amount $F_3$ (three periods in the future), you only need to deposit now in this account $F_3/(1+r)^3$, and leave it there to accrue interest. Now, if the cash flows are calculated in nominal terms, you would want to deflate them, so as to express them in today's value/purchasing power. The real value of $F_3$ is $F_3/[(1+\pi_1)(1+\pi_2)(1+\pi_3)]$, where $\pi$ is the rate of inflation. So over all we have $$NPV (F_3) = \frac {F_3}{(1+r)^3 \cdot (1+\pi_1)(1+\pi_2)(1+\pi_3)}$$ Now, if you assume a constant inflation rate (or an average - after all, $r$ is also essentially an average), then you can write $$NPV (F_3) = \frac {F_3}{(1+r)^3 \cdot (1+\pi)^3} = \frac {F_3}{[(1+r) \cdot (1+\pi)]^3} $$ $$=\frac {F_3}{(1+r +\pi +r\pi)^3}$$ Usually the term $r\pi$ is considered negligible (when we look at "usual" required rate of returns, and when inflation is low, think something like $0.1\cdot 0.02 = 0.002$). So it is common practice to be dropped (both in industry and in academia), arriving at $$NPV (F_3) = \frac {F_3}{(1+r +\pi)^3}$$ What you were given keeps the inflation rate time variant. This comes from the approximation $$i_t \approx r_t + \pi_t$$ i.e. that the nominal interest rate equals approximately the real interest rate/rate of return plus inflation. So the nominal rate of return may increase with time solely due to inflation. 

It was Alfred Marshall's doing, but based on a premise that still prevails in many parts of Economics: if prices are assumed totally elastic, then, although it may be the case that they are taken as given by the individual buyers or sellers, at market level it is quantity that determines price. So price is indeed the dependent variable, if you care about the market and not about the individual. And here is page 96 from Marshall's Principles of Economics (8th ed.1920), (the 1st edition was in 1890), the funny thing being that here Marshall talks about... individual demand! (but it would be totally confusing to swap axes between graphing individual demand and graphing market demand). Read the annotated footnote. 

So here we have a causative theoretical argument about why increased corruption causes increased inflation. Bittencourt, M. (2012). Inflation and economic growth in Latin America: some panel time-series evidence. Economic Modelling, 29(2), 333-340. Four Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru) for the period 1970-2007. As the authors note, these four countries account for $\approx 70$% of total GDP and population in South America (for 2009). The dependent variable on their regressions is the growth rate, while both inflation and a composite "political situation" variable are included as regressors. The "political situation" variable again increases with increased transparency and controls on power, and so it can be expected to correlate negatively with corruption (i.e. the higher its value, the less corruption). For our purpose we need to look not at the regression results but at the correlation matrix of the regressors: there we see that the political situation variable is negatively correlated with inflation, with correlation coefficient $-0.142$ (so again, more corruption is associated with more inflation). Overall, it appears that scholars have empirically detected a positive correlation between the level of corruption and the level of inflation, and also offered theoretical insights on how this can come about, although one theoretical model argues in favor of a causal effect from inflation to corruption, while the other from corruption to inflation. Since both arguments seem reasonable, one could think that it may be the case of a vicious feedback spiral. 

I am not sure where the interpretation issue lies. If we look at a relation $$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + u \tag{1}$$ and we declare that we would like to estimate $b_0$ and $b_1$ but that $x_1$ is "endogenous", we are essentially revealing that we are interested in the partial effect of $x_1$ on $y$ in the relation $$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + \delta'\mathbf x{^*} + e \tag{2}$$ where $\mathbf x{^*}$ contains all the (known or unknown to us) variables that are correlated with $x_1$ (and have something to do with $y$ too), and therefore, $e$ is the conditional expectation function error (not just "any" error term), and as such, by construction uncorrelated with all the variables. Alas, $\mathbf x{^*}$ is unobservable or unavailable to us. Valid IV estimation will nevertheless allow us to estimate consistently $b_1$... which is the partial effect of $x_1$ on $y$ in the above relation $(2)$. Even if we cannot account for endogeneity, the problem will be that our estimations will converge to someplace unknown. So while we will still be attempting to estimate the partial effect of $x_1$ in relation $(2)$, our numerical estimates will be unacceptable and suspect as regards their value (due to the deficiency of the estimation method) -and not because the desired (but unattainable) research target loses its fundamental interpretation. Our estimates will be "wrongly estimated partial effects". It is not the same as saying "they are not partial effects" (epistemologically speaking). ADDENDUM Responding on OP's comments and its enhancement of the question, nothing is stopping us from writing $\partial E(y \mid x, x^*)/\partial x$. At the same time our sample is realized, so is $x^*$ realized, irrespective of whether we know its realized value or not. Now note that the coefficients/partial effects are assumed constant in this linear setting, irrespective of the variability in the regressors: the partial effect will be the same for all individuals in the sample, irrespective of their actual value for the observable regressor $$\partial E(y_i \mid x_{1i}, x^*_{1i})/\partial x_{1i} = \partial E(y_j \mid x_{1j}, x^*_{1j})/\partial x_{1j} = \beta_1$$ per assumptions, where $i,j$ are two different observations/individuals in the sample. 

I offer the following reason why a business like Walmart may desire to have January end as its closing-date for the fiscal year: in anticipation of the high-season of Christmas, it is natural that inventories rise "abnormally", in order not to lose sales. Most probably Walmart has return-contracts with suppliers. So during January is when any products that did not fulfill forecasted sales are returned (especially for Christmas-specific products) in order to optimize inventories. Optimizing the value of inventories is essential for a commercial company. Assume now that such optimization takes place during January, but the fiscal year closes on Decemeber 31: the optimization would never show in the official yearly Financial Statements. The company would have to include Notes saying things like "inventories may appear high, but during January we have returned... etc". But a note in the Financial Statement is never as strong as the magnitude appearing on the Balance Sheet itself. So the company, in order to allow for an actual management practice to show in the Financial Statements (and not in order to artificially embellish its financial picture), closes the year on January end.
