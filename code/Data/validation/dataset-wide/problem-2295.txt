There's a lot of dubious assertions in the answers here, and frankly some bad advice regarding how long to wait before treating a blister. We just had a lecture on blister management in my WFR class yesterday, so I'll give this a go. The answer to "should I deflate this blister" comes down to a very simple question: Will it pop itself if I don't? Any blister on the foot is likely going to pop itself if you don't. Blisters in other locations (typically the hands) may be less likely to. 

Of course, dinosaurs are but one of many fossils out there, and this map only shows North America. The best way to find fossils near you is to search the internet for "fossils" and "your region", e.g. "fossils in Oregon" or "fossils in Ireland" or wherever you are. Many known fossil deposits are protected areas for conservation, but there are plenty of places where you can see them yourself. Many people think of giant dinosaur bones when they think of fossils, but there are millions (if not billions) of fossils of much smaller organisms out there – fossils tiny sea creatures abound embedded in rocks along coastlines, like these: 

Yes. There's nothing wrong with melting snow and then purifying it with a standard water filter. Most of the water in mountain streams was snow at some point anyways. That being said, this is generally going to be a very inefficient way to make water, and if the temperature is below (or really anywhere near) freezing, you're going to be thirsty. I would strongly recommend carrying a stove instead. Bringing water to a rolling boil kills almost all pathogens. It doesn't remove particulate matter, but clean snow generally won't have many particulates anyways. A small stove like the MSR Pocket Rocket I have weights much less than a good water filter. Not only does it allow you to melt snow, it also allows you to get a warm drink if you need it, and you can purify regular water by boiling it too. 

In the group there should be one leader. This is the most experienced person. This person responsible for the route planning, amount of food required also this person checks equipment and cloth required for the trip and decide who take what. Leader should be able detect when group is tired and when to stop for a night\make a camp. Leader should be able detect if a member does not feel good and he\she takes decision what to do in emergency situation. 

One of the most important thing in ski mountaineering is weight of equipment. So you should take only what you really need. That will allow you quickly move and enjoy a trip. Regarding what to take (Piolet(s), Whippets, ice tools): 

Older people better tolerate high altitude. For that altitude you don't need to do any special trainings\preparation. It would be enough to do any sport activity like running swimming or bicycle. The more sports you do the more comfortable you will be during your hike. 

In survival situation kid should use daylight to walk, find people and ask for help. Not spending time by building shelter. In one day kid can make 20-40km without heavy backpack. It's very hard to find a place where is no people in 20km range. If a kid need to spend a night in mountains or forest then first what is needed is to find a place protected from wind. Then put legs to backpack, wear down jacket, use foil blanket and open luminous stick. 

I think it does not matter which lighter you use if it's filled with butane. Lighter would not work if gas temperature close to boiling temperature. For butane it's -1C. For isobutane it's -11C and for propane it's -42C. Also propane has better evaporation properties. That's why gas stoves filled with 20% propane and 80% isobutane. 

So, now let's prove why this light doesn't put out 2000 lumens. It appears this light uses two 18650 batteries. The Panasonic NCR18650 PDF is one of the most common 18650 lithium battery cells, and is the cell used inside of many repackaged batteries sold by flashlight companies and inside many devices with integrated batteries. Its rated capacity is 2700 mAh and the nominal voltage is 3.6 V. For two batteries, that gives 9.7 Watt-hours. Let's look at the Cree XM-L T6 emitter, the LED specified for the product you mentioned. Cree's Data Sheet PDF gives luminous flux (lumens) data for up to 2000 mA current draw. The maximum forward current for this LED is 3000 mA. At 3000 mA the forward bias is 3.35 V, so the light would draw just about 10 W. With the batteries mentioned above, the light would last just under 1 hour, if we ignore the power consumed by the control electronics and any efficiency losses. How much light does the LED put out at 3000 mA? I plotted the luminous flux vs. current draw for the light, and fit a linear function to the data: 

However, they do have a list of alternative sources for weather alerts via SMS and email. The text service by weather.com looks to be the most promising from what I can see. It appears to be much more up-to-date than the weather.com page you linked to, perhaps it's superceded the page you found. Most cell carriers allow you to send and receive very short emails via text message. If you send a new text message to an email address instead of a phone number, you'll see what email address corresponds to the phone. For example, mine is . You could then use that email address to subsribe to weather alerts if you find a service you like that isn't available via SMS but is available via email. 

It's important to be prepare for survival situation and here is how my kid prepared(I have 7y.o. daughter): 

The outside temperature changing all the time. At evening the temperature is higher then in the night(morning). So it's normal that you fell colder during night. It's very much depends on how much tired are you. How much do you walk or work on the route during the day. 

As some people already suggested: before going to sleep you have to eat and drink hot water(tea). For example after I'm walking 8 hour with heavy bagpack in a snow I can't even get asleep. It does not matter how warm my sleeping bag is and how much cloth I wear. Only one thing helps: eat and drink something hot. 

So my choose for this rouse would be poles and 1 light ice axe for self arresting (something like Camp Corsa or Climbing Technology Agile) 

The answer from @Nate Wengert, far away from reality. I don't think that kid will be able to dig snow cave or build a shelter even having hatchet and shovel. It might be easy when you do it in good sunny weather on your backyard. Try to do it at night when you got lost, when you have frozen hands and legs. This is shelter build by adult. The guy had basic instruments like axe and saw. He wanted to try to survive in forest during winter. He died in 2 days. this guy was with his friend which decided to return to people and survived. 

The problem seems to be not in the socks. She should prevent her legs\socks from getting wet. I suggest to take off the shoes while driving. Especially shoes with Thinsulate. If her legs\socks are wet then it will be cold in any socks. 

The ANSI FL1 Standard specifies measurement procedures and reporting criteria for measuring the output (lumens), beam distance (calculated from lux), battery life, and other properties of flashlights, headlamps, bike lights, and other personal lighting equipment. This provides a repeatable, verifiable, and trustworthy way for lighting manufacturers to report device specifications. Most reputable personal lighting manufacturers follow this standard, but random generic manufacturers - like those selling the light mentioned in the question - do not. These generic sellers tend to drastically overstate and even outright lie about specifications, claiming insanely high lumen values with no data to back them up. 

With a large enough canoe, you can simply put the bike in the canoe, albeit somewhat precariously. What's more common though is for people to bike their canoe to an input, lock up the bike on shore, then return to it. 

I don't know of a source for Europe, but The American Alpine Club published "Accidents in North American Mountaineering" annually. 

Almost every emergency dispatch center has a non-emergency phone number. While services like Skype and Google Voice can't call 911 directly, you can look up "<region> non-emergency dispatch" and get a number with a local area code. Call them and tell them this is an emergency but you couldn't access 911. They will transfer you to an emergency dispatcher. If you're in a National Park or on other federal lands you can typically call the park headquarters and again ask to be transferred to emergency dispatch. 

Benadryll is available over the counter and you should have it in your first aid kit. Epi is by prescription only (at least in the US), so the individual who has allergies should carry their own. If you're leading a large group, you may be able to get a prescription and standing orders for trained staff to carry and administer epinephrine to group members. Many people think that just injecting epi when somebody has an anaphylactic attack is the entire treatment. It's important to know that epinephrine does not fix the underlying issue! It only helps to reduce swelling, helping to re-open the airway. You must fix the cause of the reaction! As soon as an exposure to a known allergen occures – even if the person isn't having a visible reaction – you need to immediately have the person take an antihistamine. Antihistamines are drugs that suppress the histamine response, i.e. the body's overreaction to an antigen. This is what actually reduces the severity of the allergic reaction itself. Correct dosage depends on the person; consult the instructions on the antihistamines or talk to a doctor. The important consideration with an allergic reaction is maintaining a clear airway. If you get the antihistamines into the patient immediately, it's possible that the reaction will be contained and the patient will not develop anaphylaxis. In the event that they do develop anaphylaxis, that's where you need to monitor their airway and administer epi if necessary. If the patient is having difficulty breathing, encourage them to take deep, calm breaths, and to pace their breathing off yours. If the patient is unable to maintain a clear airway, be prepared to administer epinephrine. Epi-pen trainer kits are widely available through first aid training programs, so if you expect to be traveling in the wilderness with people who may require epi, you should do the training. The auto-injectors have clear instructions on them; typically you just remove the blue cap, place the orange end of the auto-injector on their thigh, push down hard on the epi-pen to trigger the injector, and hold it in place for at least 30 seconds. The epi is administered automatically at the correct dosage. Make sure to carefully follow the directions as individual auto-injectors may vary in how exactly they are administered. Epi wears off after 10-15 minutes, so most people will carry either a dual-injector or two injectors, so that a second dose can be administered if necessary. When injecting, always hold the injector gripped in your fist, do not place anything over either end of the pen to ensure you don't accidentally inject it into yourself!
