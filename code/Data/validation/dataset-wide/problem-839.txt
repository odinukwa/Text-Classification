Since Andromeda is the closest galaxy, it is inside "our" galaxy cluster, and stays bound to ours by gravity. 

I do not fully understand how space and time do what they do. But I'm sure that "universe expanding faster than speed of light" doesn't mean that locally, something (i.e. any bit of information) is moving faster than light. It means to me that particles that already are too far away to exchange any information are becoming increasingly separated by "space" at a rate that can be arbitrarily big. 

As awesome as space rain would be, the sun does not deposit any water molecules on earth. Solar wind consists of ionized particles propelled into space from the sun, and while some of these particles are hydrogen, and some are oxygen ($URL$ these are ionized particles therefore incapable of bonding with each other in the manner necessary to create water. Furthermore, even if these particles did lose enough kinetic energy to reach the energy level low enough to bond to one another, it is unlikely that they would be able to do so because their high velocity, coupled with the incredibly high chance of them missing the earth and the deflective prowess of the magnetosphere would preclude such processes. If somehow enough hydrogen and oxygen atoms were low energy enough and did arrive at the poles, I doubt that they would bond, because the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water requires activation energy. 

Radial velocity is a measurement in the change of speed of the star towards us, due to the planet's rotation around it. Speed variation change is detected thanks to the Doppler spectroscopy. If the planets rotation plan is orthogonal with our direction of view, then we cannot see the radial velocity change, because the star speed towards us is constant. This would mean the planets you are talking about in your assignment were discovered using another method. Here is a picture to illustrate. By User:Zhatt - Own work, Public Domain, Link In the above, the star speed changes in the plan that is 90° with our own, so there is no radial velocity variation we can detect with Doppler spectroscopy. edit: In your case, you are not telling if inclination is 90° to the line-of-sight or to the line perpendicular to the line-of-sight. If it is 90° to the line perpendicular to the line-of-sight (which is the usual in astronomy), then speed changes are maximum. 

Read Before the Big Bang (1997) by Ernest Sternglass. The short answer is that a big piece of "dark matter" is the source of a quasar. The "non-standard" and therefore controversial theory presented in this book says that most "dark matter" might be “fragments of the original primeval atom [of Georges Lemaitre’s model --- please google it if you need to] ejected to large distances in the explosive ‘mini-Bang’ that had to accompany the formation of every cosmological structure [ie, every moon, planet, star, galaxy, etc.] in a Lemaitre-type model … the existence of quasars and active cores of galaxies over a wide range of distances indicated that there were apparently delayed mini-Bangs in which new galaxies were created, as Maarten Schmidt had conjectured, together with vast amounts of dust and gas ejected into space” [p.211, BTBB]. Plus: “All these results strongly suggested that some of the original fragments … from the Lemaitre [“primeval”] atom had managed to survive in the massive centers of large galaxies for very long periods … these massive electron[-positron] pair fragments were apparently ejected long after the Big Bang, as the Russian astrophysicist Novokov and the Israeli physicist Ne’eman had in fact suggested independently in the mid-1960s … their nuclei would be so massive that they would be invisible black holes, yet they could account for a dominant fraction of the total mass of the universe even today” [p.212, BTBB]. According to Sternglass’s model, these fragments of the primeval atom are “seeds of galaxies and stars”, and are spread throughout our universe, ever since the Big Bang. He says that a seed remains dormant for millions or billions of years,lurking in space, and then, after a long “count-down” process, during which the system divides in half, again + again + again, it suddenly explodes, violently. He calls this explosion a “mini-Bang”, and says that the “gamma-ray bursters” —(also called “quasars”)— which astronomers have observed since the 1970s, are in fact the “delayed mini-Bangs” which his model predicts. 

This is ruled out because that's not what we see when we look back in the past. If this was the case at the beginning, we would see these huge stars, with probably different characteristics from the ones formed only recently. But we don't see anything like that. From what we see when we look very far away - that's few hundreds of millions of years after the beginning - we see signatures of first generation stars forming, very big stars indeed, but nothing close to what you're talking about. 

The nemesis theory proposes that a low mass star or brown dwarf in highly elliptical orbit is a companion to our sun as a solution to the cyclical mass extinction problem ($URL$ and ($URL$ Scientists noticed that some mass extinctions follow a seemingly cyclical pattern, so researchers proposed that the orbit of a small companion star (or a brown dwarf) was disturbing comets or asteroids as it approached aphelion and flinging them towards the earth. As interesting as this would be, WISE's infrared scans of the sky have revealed nothing and there is currently no evidence supporting the theory. Furthermore the orbit of any companion would have to be very large and would therefore be very unstable and would likely be detectable. The Astrobiologist David Morrison stated of the theory: "(T)he Sun is not part of a binary star system. There has never been any evidence to suggest a companion. The idea has been disproved by several infrared sky surveys, most recently the WISE mission. If there were a brown dwarf companion, these sensitive infrared telescopes would have detected it." 

Another effect I'll try to illustrate with Wikipedia images: the sun trajectory's elevation in the sky would change year after year (cycle: between 8 and 9 earthlings years), due to moon's apsidal precession and its tilted orbit plan: By Rfassbind - Own work., Public Domain, Link By Geologician, Homunculus 2 - from English Wikipedia, CC BY 3.0, Link 

An observer on the far side of the moon would have hard time to explain it stands on a single planet, because of the movement of the most noticeable thing in the sky: the sun! Indeed, because of the eccentricity of the moon's orbit around earth, the day length, i.e. the sun's "speed in the sky", depends on where you stand in your lunar orbit. And from observations it can do, e.g. other planets that are nearly perfectly round in the solar system (and for well known reasons), she should be forced to rule out the "I'm standing on an elliptical single celestial body" hypothesis. I cannot calculate the variation of day length on the far side of the moon in a reasonable amount of time, sorry about that. 

According to theoretical work by Dr. Ernest Sternglass, there are expected to be many such groups of "rogue stars". In Sternglass's model [the "electron-positron pair model of matter"] there are expected to be many stars and clusters of stars which are not near any galaxy because of the process by which stars and star clusters form. Briefly, the model says that each kind of astronomical object, such as a single star, or a star cluster, or a small galaxy, or a large galaxy, or a galaxy cluster, etc., is formed by a single massive explosion, (known as a "quasar"). A not-very-energetic quasar might form a star cluster, while a very-energetic quasar might form a large galaxy. In other words, the model says that a quasar is a galaxy or star cluster, or other astronomical object, in the process of being born. 

It is possible but unlikely. Here is a really good 'Science 2.0' article about the possibility ($URL$ Essentially, you likely wouldn't see the light on Moon settlements because there would need to have many thousands of bright lights and windows- both of these would be impractical on a moon base (windows let in radiation and are expensive, and bright lights waste valuable power). Furthermore, in order to reach a magnitude of brightness to constitute as visible, there would have to be a very large amount settlements concentrated together. 

Well, one reckons that light from the sun will travel to the end of our universe, if in fact it has an end. One way to calculate the actual distance to the end of our universe is as follows: (1) assume that our universe is a very large "black hole" ----- understanding that a "black hole" is simply a volume of space from which light cannot escape. (2) use Schwartzschild's famous formula for the radius of a "black hole": R = 2GM/c.c where "M" is mass of universe. If one use numeric value M = 1.58E58 grams (following Sternglass), then one calculates that sun-light will reach the end of our universe after travelling approximately 2.35E30 cm.
