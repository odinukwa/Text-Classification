There is a town named Vardaman in Mississippi, about 40 miles southeast of Oxford. Faulkner could have borrowed the name because he liked the sound of it. What's more likely, however, is that he used the name of James K. Vardaman (1861-1930), who was governor of Mississippi from 1904 to 1908. They called him "Great White Chief," because like other Southern politicians of the time, he validated the racism of the white citizenry. By using that name for a child of questionable intelligence, Faulkner is also questioning the intelligence of the governor. 

Oblonsky is presented as a person who is everybody's friend. He's not an especially good person, though. He cheats on his wife. He makes a poor deal selling his land. He's not particularly good at his job. The reason he survives is because everyone likes him, but he's not sharp enough (or ruthless enough) to use this likability to his advantage. You probably know someone like him. Levin, on the other hand, doesn't have many friends. He prefers his farm to the city. He tends to focus on his own affairs, meaning he takes little interest in the affairs of others. He doesn't like small talk. Oblonsky is happy to talk to him, where few others will tolerate him. In other words, Levin has few friends, while Oblonsky has many. The relationship is asymmetric, but it works because Levin has no one else to turn to. Oblonsky could be smarter, more sober, or better at business, but as long as he's friendly, Levin will be his friend. 

So, it's reasonable for no one to say "here's how Susan is reacting to the death of her whole family", given that, well, her family doesn't know they all died. They expect to go back to our world. The last time they saw Susan, they were all alive and Susan was "silly." (Note: Lewis's opinion, not mine, etc.) The omnicient narrator doesn't bring it up at the time because at that point, the reader is also not supposed to know this. The revelation that they're in Heaven doesn't happen until the very, very end of the novel (literally the second to last paragraph), at which point there's enough grand-scale wrapping up to do, and enough on the characters' mind, that the narration doesn't return to Susan. 

While this does not answer the significance of the entire book, it focuses on a few key points. The story is actually partially autobiographical. In his early life, Borges worked in a library. In the year 1938, the same year his father died, he bumped his head on a window and nearly died of septicemia - blood poisoning. 'The south' was published in 1953, and the same thing happens to the protaganist. The later description of the hospital relates to his own time in hospital. In this interview, Borges said that 

I have been looking for significance for the rest of the book, though as yet, haven't written anything up. There have been several sites suggesting that the South represents 'Heaven' and the North 'Hell' - During his time in the hospital he suffers badly and is always wishing that he could return south to his home. Other sites also say he dreamed up a heroic death for himself, perhaps how he may have wanted to die, in the south, while in fact he dies on the operating table. This may be Borges thinking about what could have happened to himself had things gone different. Sources: 

Have you been to a library recently? In olden times, libraries had books. Lots of books. That was how you learned things. When newspapers and magazines came along, libraries added newspapers and magazines. When videotapes and DVDs came along, libraries added videotapes and DVDs. Each time they cut down on their books to make room. When the Internet came along, libraries didn't need books or newspapers or magazines or videotapes or DVDs. All these media will go the way of the clay tablet and the papyrus scroll. Now that we have the Internet, we can get the very best news and information, right? or at least the very best cat memes. Bradbury extrapolated a trend. Television, a new technology in his time, could have been used to enlighten and inform. Instead it became "the idiot box," "the boob tube." The government wasn't responsible for that. Networks show what people want to watch. Every day there's something new: spin doctors, echo chambers, infotainment, silos, alt-facts, anything to avoid reality. If it doesn't affect us directly, if it doesn't agree with our preconceived notions, let it burn. People who read books are dangerous, therefore books are dangerous. It's not true, but it's what people want to believe. Ostensibly, Fahrenheit 451 is about destroying books. In reality it's about destroying ideas, destroying even the capacity to have ideas, and in the end destroying our minds and thus ourselves. 

This isn't an official guideline, but it seems good advice. So in the case of my example, like this: 

The character deserves to be connected to words they say, it defines who they are as a character. But we don't want to give the idea that they aren't fictional. But a character usually does not express the ideas of the author. So we can't just say the author. The best, and in my opinion fairest way to say both, and the novel. In your example, the quote should go as follows: 

I agree with this, especially where it says 'if I wasn't sure that everybody would know who I was talking about I would go on to cite the book title and author.' and the Shakespeare/Juliet example Yahoo One answer: 

The full text on Amazon makes it clear that this is a Hollow Earth book. According to the myth (and that's all it is), there are holes in the Earth at both poles. They provide passage to another world inside our planet, which is hollow. Once inside, you can get out again through either hole, which explains the confusion. Byrd was definitely in Antarctica in February 1947, so it's the only way he could get to the Arctic with nobody noticing. That's an awful long way to go on one tank of gas, though. 

That refers to the "answer" alluded to in the previous sentence. When you have a million dollars, you don't appreciate the things you already have. In the case of their gifts, it really is the thought that counts, because they've rendered each other's gifts useless. Them refers to the titular gifts, specifically, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Henry may be implying that the Christ child didn't need the gift of wisdom. 

This seems to indicate it was planned to stop on the number 75, though Carey doesn't mention why. It could just have easily ended slightly before if the climax was a few issues before hand, the repercussions didn't have to continue for so long. It could have been planned just to end on 75 because that is quite a nice number, but I doubt that is the case. It is most likely that Carey had noticed this and decided to likewise end on 75. The fact it was planned in advance to end on the same number seems to infer that it was intentional. 

Funerals are for the living. Deathbed promises, on the other hand, are for the dying. The story (as you note) is autobiographical, so this issue must have weighed heavily on Poe. His wife was sick, but far from dead, when he wrote this story. The loss of his mother at an early age could also have influenced his predilection for doomed ladies. The narrator claims to be insane. This is Romantic shorthand for "I'm different from everyone else, nobody understands me, I experience things intensely." Poe takes it a step further because his narrators really are insane, thanks to some horrible experience. He mirrors it by claiming he was sane before but no longer is, while presenting the "sane" part as a dream world. When his beloved dies, the narrator's outward world changes to reflect his inward world. This is more mirroring, another Romantic trope ("It was a dark and story night"), having the environment respond to the character rather than vice versa. This is when he claims to go insane. He hears murmuring in the wind. The narrator leaves the valley. This is a sort of rebirth, because mirroring. He may have broken his vow by leaving, and he certainly signals his intention to break it. This he now does. It's worth asking, though, if the vow still binds him, and if not, when it stopped. The narrator meets and marries another woman. In a horror story, the dead Eleonora would appear and wreak vengeance (a story Poe would eventually write). For now, a disembodied murmuring offers forgiveness and, once he's in heaven, an explanation. The voice mentions Eleonora in the third person and uses a "familiar and sweet voice," which could be the wind's. Of course, he's crazy, so you can't be sure. There is no way to know what Poe meant to say. There is no way to know what Eleonora herself would have said about the narrator's new love. The only thing you can truly know is how grief and redemption affect you. The real insanity would be to let grief ruin the rest of your life. 

It came from personal experience While he didn't die, he once got repeatedly stung by a bunch of yellowjackets. The TombQuest Wiki says this about the matter: 

A computer scientist named Randal Olson actually worked out an algorithm of how to find him. There are 68 total pages to look in across the 7 books - and by plotting the locations he made a heat map using Kernel Density Estimation: 

Warning: MASSIVE spoilers ahead. If you haven't read the last Harry Potter book, but plan to do so, turn back now 

The optimal search path is to start in the black circle and follow the black line. Supposedly, this will help you find him as quick as possible. A few other tips that I used: 

Expanding from my comment. Warning for disturbing themes and also a lot of links to fairy tales. "Seasons of Glass and Iron" pulls from several fairy tales. It looks to me that variations on The Princess on the Glass Hill, The Enchanted Pig, and The Black Bull of Norroway are most prominent--however, there are references to many others scattered throughout. Tabitha thinks of her brother with winged sandals, and of women forced to wear "shoes of glass; ... shoes of iron heated red–hot." Amira references "words of desire [that] tumbled from men’s lips like diamonds and toads," and "a story about nettle shirts thrown up to swans." Therefore, I think it's reasonable to look at other fairy tales for inspiration as to what the king and Amira could have meant. Here's what we know his requirements are: 

However another good reading order, and IMO the better one, would be as follows (again main novels in bold, and note that I've jumbled short stories, novellas etc. under one title 'short story'): 

Could this be it? It seems to be a reasonably famous book (Cover says over 2 million copies sold) so it might be something your library had. 

This quote was of course from the Christmas hating Ebenezer Scrooge. However, if we quote this as coming from Dickens, someone not familiar with his book may assume that Dickens hated Christmas, which we have no evidence for. He may have written the words, but it isn't his quote. He is giving the words to a character. But if we quote it to Ebenezer Scrooge, again someone not familiar with the name may assume they are a real person. So it seems we can't just quote one or the other. Someone made the point that if the character is really famous we can just quote their name, but that's not true. Not everyone will have heard of a character, and someone else made the point they wont be as famous in a couple of hundred years. There have been discussions similar on english.se and writers.se, but none give a definite answer. However, one of the answers gives a link to this site. It reaches the conclusion at the bottom that:
