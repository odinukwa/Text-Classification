Using the brain for any of the "seven deadly sins" is, perhaps, too easy. Any sin could come from the brain. Instead, I suggest the following: 

Let's start with the biggest changes. Assuming that the loss of privacy is fairly sudden (over the course of a few years, rather than decades or centuries): Entertainment Industry would go bust Television shows and movies would cease to be. Even if the television studio managed to film in secret, there only needs to be a single television viewer, and everyone in the world can watch his television, or watch the movie right off the movie screen... from the comfort of home. Similarly, live theater and live music performances will lose out. Why pay good money for something you can watch for free? Of course, there will always be people who will pay, just to hang out with other fans, but there would be a noticeable drop. Adult entertainment will lose almost 100%; why even bother digging through ads online, when you can watch real people in real situations whenever you want? Sports will also suffer; people will still travel to go to games, but the money from television ads will be gone forever. Of course, new entertainment venues would pop up - lists of who or what are interesting to watch, and the best times. Not that they would be able to charge any money for it. For once, piracy would have a legitimate impact on business! The entertainment industry has a tremendous impact on culture, and the sudden loss of television, movies, even sports or music would have a huge impact. Everyone would be a criminal There aren't enough people to watch everyone all the time, but without an expectation of privacy, the various world governments would want to make sure their citizens were behaving. Thus, they would use an automated method of watching; whenever anyone did anything against the law, they would immediately be caught, fined, or otherwise punished. Of course, everyone that has broken the law, even if they didn't realize it. All those stupid laws will suddenly start making a lot of money . Have you ever invited friends over to watch pay-per-view? Against the rules. Have you ever gone over the speed limit? Ever? Even if it was only for a few seconds? Against the rules. No more speeding on the highway, jaywalking, or hunting ducks from a mule. Many of the stupid rules would go away, of course. It only takes one politician getting caught bathing with a moose to get THAT law off the books. And speaking of politicians... Scandals and corruption would vanish Some corruption would go away, since the corrupt individuals would be caught, but the rest would become legal, even expected. Scandals would be a thing of the past; it's a bit less scandalous when everyone watches it unfold. Physical keys Today, passwords, passkeys, key codes, PINs, and other information based keys are increasingly popular. If anyone can watch anything anytime, there is no way to enter a password securely. Any secure transaction will have to use a physical security key, and a complex key at that. Even fingerprints or retinal scans won't work, because those images can be grabbed. Society as a whole would have to change the way information is stored. Schools and Safety Schools would actually be much different; I expect that children would simply stay home, since it would no longer be dangerous. Parents and police can keep their eyes on children, while the children watch and interact with remote teachers. Cities would be much safer, as any dangerous people would be kept off the street. Crime, especially violent crime, would plummet as everyone realized it was impossible to get away with anything. Abductions would be almost nonexistent. Relationships and Job Hunts Relationships would cease to be built on trust; instead, you could look up your date's love life, money habits, even choice of toothpaste. Dating agencies would fare better than ever as chance meetings would plummet. Businesses would still make stupid hiring decisions, based on irrelevant metrics, like personality type, average number of bathroom trips, or number of toothbrushes used, which means even less of a chance of being hired for your actual skills. Not that your skills would matter, because... Life can't exist without privacy Businesses without privacy become monopolies. Introverts without privacy go insane. Governments without privacy become bullies. People would become secretive and withdrawn, fearing to share any information with anyone, lest it become public knowledge. Humanity would tear itself to shreds. 

Most of the answers focus on sword or knife-like weapons, used to slash or stab. In those cases, a serrated blade does a lot of damage to skin; instead of a clean (or mostly clean) slice, a serrated blade would tear, rend, and shred any skin it passed by. If your sole goal is to make a ragged bleeding mess of anything you stabbed, and you are willing to take the extra cost of sharpening each serration, a serrated sword vs. a 'normal' sword probably wouldn't be much different, apart from the shape of the wounds caused. However, more damage comes at a cost; stabbing someone with a thin, straight blade will take a lot less effort than stabbing someone with a serrated edge, doubly so if they are in any sort of armor. Even thick clothing would make a serrated edge less effective. However, there are other uses for serrations; a special, very strong knife with (dull) serrations on one side, known as a sword-breaker, was used as an off-hand weapon, to catch and twist the sword of your attacker. These weapons could snap the blade of a sword that is caught by it. Occasionally serrated barbs were also added to shields, for much the same purpose. Serrations on an axe or hammer may actually improve the weapon, though it would be easier to use a spike. The serrated edge would carry the force of the weapon strike through a much smaller surface area, possibly resulting in poking holes through the armor. Of course, sharpened serration would be quickly dulled, and prone to break off, which is why most hammers used a single sharp spike to pierce armor. 

Ok, so you're a sorcerer, and you want to sell spells that anyone can use, but you want them to keep coming back for more. No reusable spells unless you say so. Each spell contains words that describe the effects of the spell, using logic and chemistry. This is actually the key; or, rather, the lock. Use logic to describe the spell such that it can only be used in the way you intend, which includes only being used once. The key for every method is the phrase uttered to activate the spell. Physical Verification Each spell, as written, should incorporate the paper on which it was written. Paper is easy to come by, but no two sheets are the same; parchment even more so. Fibers, blemishes, stains, and inconsistencies make every sheet of paper entirely unique. Thus, adding a phrase to the spell that requires the exact paper the spell was originally written on for it to function would lock the spell to that paper. If the words were copied, the paper they were copied onto would be different, ruining the spell. It may be possible to re-write the spell to remove the reference to paper, but if you're capable of doing that, you might as well write your own spells and save yourself the time and effort. The pros of this method is that absolutely, positively no one will copy your spell. If they understand it, they won't need to; if they don't, they won't be able to decipher it. Either way, rather than copying the spell, they would need to write a new, slightly different spell to make it work. The cons are that this spell will be unique for every sheet it's printed on, and as such will take time to write each one individually. Encryption and Remote Verification Each spell, when written, is encoded with a special key phrase, randomly generated for each. The characters of the original spell, once decoded by the phrase, automatically activate. To a user, it will appear that the words are activated by the phrase. Without decrypting the spell, it's just a jumble of letters that mean nothing. This version is easily transferred from one paper to another; however, it remains a single-use spell. The key is the locked spell. Part of the locked spell describes a small object being destroyed; a specific pebble, for instance. Once the unlock phrase is used, the actual spell is unscrambled and activated, destroying the pebble before completing the spell. Once the pebble is destroyed, the spell cannot activate again. The pros for this method are that the spell is double-encoded; not only will the single-use pebble keep the spell from being used more than once, the spell itself is hidden behind encryption. The cons are that the pebbles will need to be stored somewhere, possibly with a timestamp when they are consumed, so you know when your users have fired their spell. Also, the spell may be copied, used, then the original paper sold. It won't work, which could give you bad publicity. Also, each sheet will be radically different, because of the encryption, which means mass production is very difficult. And finally, this requires several spells working together to work, meaning this is a very complicated work. It should only be used for very expensive spells. Remote Access Magic This combines the best parts from above into one useful, simple, and above all mass-producible method. On your spellsheet, write two spells. At the top, a spell that activates the spell on the bottom half of the paper; at the bottom, the spell you are selling. As part of the second spell, destroy the entire paper on which it is written. After writing the spells, tear the paper in half; keep the half with the actual spell, and sell the top half of the paper. Anyone that copies that text will get nothing, since the paper they use won't have another spell at the bottom. Anyone, even powerful hackers - I mean, sorcerers - who attempts to use the spell will only be able to use it once, since the spell self-destructs. The method of self-destruction, along with the main spell, will remain entirely secret, because it will never leave your possession. Pros of this method include hiding your spell entirely, being able to mass-produce pages as fast as your minimum-wage scribes can copy, and the ability to monitor when spells are used. Cons include having to store the spells safely, and the fact that it does require two spells.
