You could look further into how currently used weather models actually work. If you want to do a prediction you will have to run a model which is not just as simple as your question would imply. There are actually many equations in parallel and that describe how motions in a grid behave. Sub grid phenomena like rain are parametrized also. Rain depends e.g. on moisture convergence and aerosol physics describing water droplet growth. This is really a broad question and I suggest you to ask another question if you want information about something more specific about forecasting. 

There is one timezone that is completely uninhabited: the UTC-12:00. It covers only two islands: Baker Island and Howland Island that are both uninhabited (owned by US). Because of the weird way timezones are divided in the pacific there are timezones that practically use the same time (e.g. UTC+12 and UTC-12), but are actually in two different days. However if you strictly interpret the question no-one is lonely here as there is no-one here, so this might not comply. The second least population is at UTC+08:45 that covers village of Eucla and other villages in Australia with a population of around 200. The area is surrounded by signs to remind you to turn your clocks, but it is unofficial so it might not comply either. The third least population is at UTC+10:30 that covers an island called the Lord Howe Island that belongs to Australia and inhabits 382 people. If you don't accept timezones that aren't in integer changes from UTC then this UTC+10:30 might not satisfy your curiosity. The first full integer timezone shift from UTC (that has any population) is UTC-02:00 that consists of Atlantic islands of Brazil like Fernando de Noronha, Trindade, Martim Vaz etc. Also South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands of UK belong in this timezone. The total population then is somewhere around 2700 people. Unfortunately these are the places that use this timezone all year round and other areas like densely populated Brazilian cities use this timezone as daylight saving during their summer increasing the population drastically so even this timezone might not satisfy your criteria. Finally UTC-11:00 being full integer change from UTC, with only all year round usage (isn't a daylight saving timezone for anyplace) consists of American Samoa, Midway Atoll, Jarvis Island and Palmyra Atoll of US and Niue of New Zealand and has under 60000 inhabitants. Ps. The estimated population numbers are from the wikipedia pages of the locations mentioned. 

As already commented; a good indicator for rain in soundings is that the lower troposphere is saturated by water. Individual saturated levels would imply moisture, but if the moisture doesn't reach the surface then it maybe just clouds or rain that evaporates before reaching surface (virga). The deeper the saturated layer, the better indicator for rain it is. The dew point and ambient temperature doesn't necessarily have to be exactly the same, but very close to each others. You pointed out cin and cape, but they are really just indicators for forcing convection and aren't necessarily present when it already rains. 

In atmospheric remote sensing of methane, a dominant source of error is the uncertainty in spectroscopic parameters. For example, in the retrieval algorithms described by Batchelor et al. (2009), the CH₄ error due to line intensities is estimated at 16.5% (dominating the total error of 16.8%), versus 10.5% for O₃, 3.8% for N₂O, and only 1.6% for HCl. The article documenting the 2012 HITRAN spectroscopic database update (Rothman et al., 2013) states: 

In Scotland, the Caledonian Forest has been cut down by humans. According to an unsourced Wikipedia article the tree line in Scotland is at 500 metre (it does not indicate the tree line elevation difference between southeast and northwest Scotland, which should be considerable). That means considerable areas are naturally bare, and therefore arguably less unnatural than the areas where forests have been cleared. When I pass through Scotland, is there a way to tell whether the spot I stand on had a forest before that was cleared, or that it is a naturally bare area? 

Out of the total water on Earth, only a tiny fraction is held in the atmosphere at any given time. Therefore, the direct effect of melting land or sea ice will not result in an increase in specific humidity. However, warm air can contain more water than cold air, according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Therefore, the climate warming that causes the ice caps to melt, will also result in an increase in average specific humidity. This is (approximately) an exponential relation (I don't have access to my textbooks right now, but googling saturation vapour pressure water equation yields many forms; I do not include them here because none I found use SI units). 

The 2012 edition includes a very large update on methane measurements, as detailed by Brown et al. (2013), who describe how the number of HITRAN methane lines has increased from 11,803 in the 1982 edition, via 251,440 in the 2004 edition, to 468,013 in the 2012 edition. However, neither Rothman et al. (2013) nor Brown et al. (2013) describe why the determination of methane spectroscopic parameters is so difficult. Why are methane spectroscopic parameters harder to determine (and therefore more poorly known) compared to other common Earth atmospheric trace gases? 

You can use simple logarithms to calculate the answer. The number of half-lives that have elapsed can be calculated with $$ - \frac{\log{f}}{\log{2}} $$ where $f$ is the fraction that remains. So plugging in the numbers gives $$ - \frac{\log(0.75)}{\log(2)} = 0.415 = 41.5\% $$ 

(I had the opposite problem, needing skin temperature, and being tempted to use 2 metre temperature instead, until I realised where the data were). If you encounter a model that really only has the full temperature profile, then I would contact the authors to inquire. Maybe it is a model that really only does well in the free atmosphere, and is not suitable for the extraction of (near-) surface temperatures. The boundary layer can be a hard thing to model! 

I will answer the question with some simplifying assumptions that might then provide a coarse guess of the area needed. First lets assume that temperatures have risen $1^{o}C$ and that the cooling film acts as increasing surface albedo effectively reflecting that an additional fraction of sunlight (93/1366) from earth. By following the footsteps of the idealized greenhouse model we can derive the surface temperature as: $$T_{s} = \bigg(\frac{S_{0}(1 - \alpha_{p})}{4 \sigma (1 - \frac{\epsilon}{2})}\bigg)^{1/4}$$ Where $T{_s}$ is surface temperature, $S_{0}$ is the solar constant ($1366W/m^ 2$), $\alpha_{p}$ is the planetary albedo, $\sigma$ is the Stefan Boltzmann constant and $\epsilon$ is the emissivity. By approximating the planetary albedo as 0.3 and emissivity as 0.78 we get that the surface temperature of is 288K. We can now set that the surface temperature is one degree smaller and there is an addition to the planetary albedo due to the cooling films. Solving for albedo: $$\alpha_{p} = -\bigg(\frac{T_{s}^{4}4\sigma (1-\frac{\epsilon}{2})}{S_{0}} - 1\bigg)$$ By substituting the values we find that planetary albedo has to be about 0.31, so cooling of one degree has been reached by a 0.01 additional albedo. The ratio of the cooling film absorbency and solar constant $\frac{93}{1366} \approx 0.07$ can be seen as the additional planetary albedo if the cooling film is installed globally. This being seven times the needed change of albedo implies that a seventh of earths surface should be covered. This doesn't take into account any secondary effects, that all areas of earth aren't equally important, that earths albedo isn't constant, nor is the emissivity, angle of radiation matters, this equation doesn't really take into account greenhouse effect(it just uses values that provides in current state case reasonable numbers), et cetera. More accurate answer would come by running a climate model and tweaking albedo in fixed grid cells. 

The distance of earth to sun is proportional to the intensity of sunlight we receive. The distances between perihelion and aphelion are quite small, so the differences in sunlight intensities are too - wiki. If the alternative circular orbit would be the average radius of the current ellipse then northern hemisphere summers would have slightly more intense sunlight, hotter, and and vice versa for the southern hemisphere, cooler (less UV). 

First you would have to read the data for example in matlab. Then you can get the whole field interpolated with the function griddata in matlab. And there also exist a landmask -function that allows you to further plot a map of your liking. So yes this is possible and there are the necessary functions at least in matlab and I would guess that in other languages too. 

(Source: NCEI) The detailed structure is somewhat different, which has to due with local climate and circulation, but the overall trend related to humidity and proximity to ocean shows up in both. We can also see the mountains, which I would guess to be a snow albedo feedback effect (ever notice how nights get colder when the ground is snow-covered?). At NCEI you will also find similar maps for the rest of the USA. 

A common layman explanation for why does it get colder to higher elevations (considering only the troposphere here) qualitatively boils down to The Sun heats the Earth's surface and the Earth's surface heats the atmosphere. I remember that, every time I heard or read this explanation as a child, I thought: then why is the Tibetan plateau still colder than lowlands at the same latitude? After all, the solar energy reaching the surface in Tibet is no less. Clearly there is more to it. Considering a remark from a quantum physics lecturer that you only really understand something after you've taught the subject twice, I'm phrasing my question as such: How does one explain, in layman terms, why the Tibetan plateau is colder than lowlands at similar latitudes? 

I would recommend to do an undergraduate in physics. I work at a department of Meteorology. When faculty hire a new PhD student or postdoc, they often prefer those with an undergraduate in Physics than with an undergraduate in Meteorology. The Physics degree gives a better preparation for doing science. It has more maths and physicists are more likely to have some programming experience than meteorologists. For most scientific positions, such programming experience is highly valuable. It appears the meteorologists are more likely to end up in jobs like weather forecasting or energy trading, rather than science. Although this experience may be quite localised, a physics undergraduate degree does give you a more generic background. It's easier to catch up on the specifics of geophysics when you have a physics background, than the other way around. 

Never is a very, very long time. Almost never is a vague term. The age of deep ocean water has been studied with both models and observations, and both indicate a lower limit age in the order of thousands of years, rather than decades. Here, age is defined as elapsed time since contact with the surface, which would be the only opportunity for evaporation. On a geological timescale, all ocean water has ample opportunity to evaporate and fall back as rain again and again. On a human timescale, not so much: for some water in the ocean, it has been well over a thousand years since the last time it was near the surface. For an example of a recent study into the topic:
