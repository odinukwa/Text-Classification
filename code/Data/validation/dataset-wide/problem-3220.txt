This question made me scratch my head for a minute. I think there may be some false premises in the OP's question that have been overlooked. I will paraphrase the Q: "Why didn't they aim nuclear weapons at each other at the places where their landmasses were the closest?" If that's a correct read of the question then it seems to assume a few things: 1. armies need to be in close proximity for a nuclear war 2. a nuclear war will mainly be against massed armies 3. the land itself is of the most value to fight about So 1: Nuclear weapons are mostly intended to be sent far, far away. Their immediate devastation and long-term effects make them something you don't want any good guys to be near, with the exception of last-resort weapons like the nuclear artillery and nuclear backpacks. Also there is no point having nukes facing off against nukes in an isolated theater. No one thinks they can kill the others' before launch, so if either one fired, the other would fire before the first guy's landed, meaning both sides' nukes would land on empty launchers and the skeleton crews manning them. Mostly though, point 1 hinges on point 2: While military equipment is indeed hardened against the effects of a nuclear blast and after-effect, nuclear strategy is not centered around destroying the bad guy's army, per se. Nuclear weapons are fielded with the intention of destroying the offending civilization in its entirety. Granted, the bad guy's army will hopefully be destroyed too, but if that were the real goal there would be far fewer nuclear weapons deployed -- only enough to kill military installations. A rough guess is it would only take 5 shots per opposing military installation to have a good chance of eliminating that installation. Meanwhile, when Reagan and the Soviets were negotiating arms reductions, the Soviets were looking at nuking the continental USA itself a few times over. 3: The reason we massed armies in West Germany was because that's where the people were. In some conflicts you just want land. So you go after the land. When you want to subdue a country, land is not the goal, so you go after its population centers and seats of gov't. Then, in the Civil War to subdue the south we changed things up to where you didn't just capture the capital city and declare victory-- you needed to kill the bad guy's army. And so it is to this day with conventional (non-nuclear war). However, as Semaphore pointed out, the cold war was a war of ideas and ideas aren't land and they aren't armies-- they're people who live in population centers. And with a war of ideologies you want to subdue the people. So that's where the armies are going to go. Now it apparently wasn't a GIVEN that the 3rd world war would be nuclear, or else why the massed military buildup in Europe? So what we can ultimately see is that the reason there weren't a bunch of nukes in the arctic is because there was no one there to kill. The non-nuclear armies wouldn't mass there either because there was nothing to defend other than land and since land isn't what either one was really going after it would be a waste to attack or defend en masse there. Finally, again there is no point having nukes facing off against nukes in an isolated theater where they won't knock out other nukes or kill lots of people. The reason that they fought everywhere but by each other's northern border is that they fought where people are, where people (governments) could be influenced. AND, I might add, these proxy wars were not nuclear standoffs, with the exclusion of Turkish and Cuban missiles which were emplaced to improve the ability to wipe out the other's center of civilization. 

This site implies that the redcoat was given a higher allowance of live ball shot than other nation's soldiers, however the source is not stated. An Osprey book confirms the figures for the British army though, although there is no information provided for the state of the other armies. 

I'm talking about the formational fighting show in this video: $URL$ Where did the show's creators get the source material? If so, what was it called, when did this style of fighting start and was it effective? 

In the late middle ages, every knight or even his retainers and squires were armed with a spear or a lance. When heavy cavalry gave way to pike squares, we still see the lance still in use among the demi-lancers. Somewhere along the way though, they completely disappeared, surviving only in the Polish army and appropriately enough to be resurrected by them in the 18th century when the effectiveness of the Polish cavalry was shown. Since then, the lance stayed with cavalry until they became mechanized. A possible culprit is the Reiter employing the caracole which showed tactical supremacy over the lancer in many battles such as Coutras but that doesn't explain why they suddenly became resurgent again in the 18/19th century. What caused the lance's short disappearance and why? If it indeed was firearms and caracolle tactics, then what made them become popular again later on? 

Even in August, Japan still kept garrisons in China totalling around 3 million men. They were second-line troops and poorly equipped, yes, but why did Japan not recall everyone to defend the home islands as the US invasion draws near? 

Typical decisive battles in Roman times involve 4+ legions - around 20,000 men + auxiliaries giving a total of about 30,000 men, on the Roman side only. Battles in even the late middle ages and early modern age typically involve 30,000 men in total. Even Alexander the Great mustered over 40,000 men in tiny Greece with an estimated population of 3,000,000 whereas mighty France with an estimated population of 13,000,000 in the years before the black plague could only barely match that number at Crecy. Given the increase in population over 1,500 years later, why did the early modern world not see more battles of ancient classical scale? 

"The Man Who Laughs" is set in England during the 17th century (not 18th). It was a time of religious conflict, with for example James II being Roman Catholic and taking steps towards religious freedom. The church did not have a strong grip on peoples religions at this time. Heresy was indeed illegal, but it is not automatically heretical to have your own religious group and meetings. Heresy was more strict than that. So there was definitely several religious groups in England at this time. Some of them were persecuted, and this in fact was a strong incentive for some people to move to the American colonies. But not all groups were persecuted, because not all non-conformism was heretical. 

To have widespread corruption you need to have a big state so that you have a lot of politicians and bureaucrats that can be corrupt, or you have to have valuable natural resources, so there is a big incentive for corruption. The newly created USA did not have any of these. Hence there was not really that many people to corrupt, nor that much reason to be corrupted. 

We don't know the secular historical crime that Yeshua ben Yosef was executed for. The reason we don't know this is that there are no such records from Roman times. All we have are texts written a lot later, by people who was not there and never met this Yeshua, and was only told about it. In fact, most texts that we have are written by people, who got all their information from Paul of Tarsus, who was not there and never met Yeshua ben Yosef himself. As such, the information we have is at best third-hand. In addition to this, it's generally written with specific aims in mind. As such, one of the text claims that Pontios Pilatos said "I find no fault in this man" with regards to Yeshua. But do we know that for sure? No, this is likely to be a part of an effort of the Romans who wrote the texts to blame the Jews for the Crucifixion, and putting less blame on the Romans, in an effort to make the religion more palatable to Romans. But it was a crucifixion which was a roman punishment, and one especially used for lower classes. The Jewish bible does not prescribe crucifixion as a punishment at all. If Yeshua's crime had been a Jewish religious affair, he would rather have been stoned (or possibly strangulated, if he was deemed to prophesy). As such, there are simply no reliable sources on this, and therefore we do not know the reason he was executed. Any discussion about it is therefore not much than at best educated speculation. Many of the crimes that would have been punishable by execution would have been incompatible with the Jewish faith anyway. Tradition has it that three men was crucified that day, and that the other two were thieves. If Yeshua ben Yosef was executed for crimes like this his followers would have kept quiet about it and in that case they would have made up an acceptable reason. But yet again, we don't know if the story of these two thieves is true, it may very well also have been made up. It's very convenient from a religious standpoint, as one of the thieves is regretful and the other not, as this forms a good basis for a moral story, which is how it's used in the bible. A probably more likely, and for his followers, acceptable, reason would be if he was executed for sedition or revolting against the Roman rule. This is also compatible with him being a religious leader, as the Jewish religious leadership was in power with the support of the Roman rulers. As such it is possible that if he was deemed to try to overthrow the Jewish religious leadership, he might have been sentenced as trying to overthrow the Roman power in Jerusalem, and that would definitely have been punishable by crucifixion, even for a high-standing citizen. Again, if this was the case, the later Roman authors of the biblical texts would have kept quiet about that, as they had no interest in portraying their religion as opposed to Roman rule. As such this is a quite popular theory, but again it's just speculation. 

On paper the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies appears much stronger with about twice the land and population. So how come it was Victor Emmanuel II who became King of Italy and not Francis II Bourbon? Was it a combination of luck and skill through Cavour's deals with the French, or did the Northern kingdom also possess a much better economy, institutions and army? 

How many of them fought on in the Free French Forces and how many of them simply repatriated back to France? 

The purpose of the Cruiser was to roam the high seas, picking off merchant vessels, troopships or stragglers of a group. So then why were heavy and light cruisers often attached to Battleship or Carrier groups, and how was their purpose different to the attached Destroyers? 

Whilst most of China is quite culturally and ethnically diverse, there are significant areas especially on the coast and river plains which are mostly Han Chinese. These provinces are also united by a strong central government for much of their history, and did not spend any significant amount of time divided since the start of the Song Dynasty. Yet, they remained linguistically divided for centuries until the Communist Party declared that everyone should speak Putonghua/Guoyu/Mandarin, and even then local dialects are still very popular in the south. As an example, my family emigrated from China in the 1930s and can only speak a dialect known as Hakka, whilst my colleagues in Guangzhou are more comfortable with Cantonese than Mandarin. I can understand why different ethnic groups have different dialects, but why is their a difference in the Han Chinese themselves? Presumably the coastal and river cities would be heavily involved in commerce with each other, necessitating a common language? Yet Guangzhou and Beijing speak differently. Why? 

This is unfortunately the only source I could find which describes COMECON's imperialist tendencies in great detail. The article was written in Albania in 1981, so one should take it with a grain of salt as Albania was not in the Soviet camp but the Chinese, and it was not so long ago that China and the USSR experienced a massive deterioration of relations. The article also does not reference many sources but I think that Albania, being aligned to the Communists, would have a better perspective of reality east of the Iron Curtain than anyone in the west. I have extracted select statements of interest below. The article states that the intention originally was probably to control the satellite states but over time evolved into corruption on a state scale. For example, as was the case in Czechoslovakia and Hungary:
