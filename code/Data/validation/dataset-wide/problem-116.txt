Under the assumption of no data loss during the transfer (due to any object in the transfer medium). Your system still has two problems. 

Energy. The amount of energy to convert mass to energy (twice) is huge, remember the formula E=mc2. This means that transfer a 10 tons of mass means 10^20 [J], which is insane. Information. You are not transfering energy, you're transfering information, data related to how mass should be built. A human body has 7*10^27 atoms, while a terabyte are only 10^12 bytes. So the data transfer assuming a single "wire" will need so much time that the system would be useless to transfer more than few molecules. 

Probably the subject would be already dead by a fungal infection. In case the subject is still alive: 

That society will last until the first crime or until the first disagreement. Once you have a crime, no matter whether is big or small, the society will realize that they need surveillance to prevent further crimes. When you have a disagreement you need someone to break the tie and make a veredict, hence that creates hierarchy. 

Low chances due to tectonics, because the crust that is lost by the movement of tectonic plates usually is the crust that is below the sea. The surface that covers continents might move or go up due tectonics, but almost never disappear. The worst case would be that the remnats are buried in a mountain like the Tibet or the Alps, but never below the sea. Yes by other force of nature. Like any other fossil, the remnants of your civilization might be convered by sediments and later on turn into stone or leave their mark in the stone. 

Napoleonic wars were the continuation of the French revolution. Therefore, these wars were between the old and new order. All monarchs saw France as a potential danger to them, in the same way as Russian revolution was a danger to other countries during the XX century. So I think the best parallel is indeed the Russian revolution. The Soviet Union didn't try to expand its influence beyond their frontiers and that helped them to survive, even though they were isolated. While Napoleon, by extending his influence beyond France doomed the revolution. Because no prolongued peace was possible, only ceasefires thanks to his military talent. He was a virus that other monarchs must destroy in order to preserve themselves. By 1812 no step back was possible. If any it would have been only another truce. He must defeat completely all other monarchs in order to preserve his empire. 

Let's take the most well-known alternative universe which involves magic: Harry Potter. What do people in Harry Potter do that we, as Muggles, can't do in the real world? 

It's well known that SpaceX has a long term goal of getting people on Mars. Let's assume some time has elapsed since humanity's transition to Mars. Due to lack of transport infrastructure and hostile terrain, humanity has settled down in separate zones set up in relatively habitable areas on the planet's surface. But now, it is observed that some people(scientists and such) will need to organize meetings for exchange of information. Due to vast distances between zones, planes are the only medium which can be used for transport. What will the planes on Mars be like? Will hypersonic planes be the norm? Travelling by air on Mars needs you to be fast: 

As we know, solar power is the ultimate source of energy for mankind, and it's the most abundant(I have read that we receive more than 1000 times the energy we currently use, if we were to have a way to utilize all of it). The power of solar is weakened because of the 93-million-mile distance between us and the Sun, so the energy we receive is very dilute and utilizing it is difficult. But what if we were to change that? If we send a satellite close to the sun(as close as it can handle), convert the sunlight that falls on the satellite into broad laser beams and transmit to receivers on the Earth, we could get far higher energy densities than what is currently being done(one could think of the Icarus from the Bond movie Die Another Day.) There would be losses, but I doubt they'd be higher than they currently are. Then once on the Earth, we could use large lenses to dilute the energy back to the level on which it could be fed to heavy-duty solar panels. Apart from the high cost of robust materials needed to sustain all that heat(we could use tungsten, for example, for the satellite body), what are the other considerations for this? Is there any obvious flaw I haven't noticed? 

In our universe I don't see a lot of advantage they could have. However, in the dark era of the 41th millenium why not.... They would be the perfect inquisitorial shock troops to fight daemons and creatures of chaos. Just give them something like a vox-com, saying in their ears at any time that they are the children of the God Emperor and must destroy the daemons and kill the heretics. Good point, these guys just couldn't be corrupted by sects and cultists. Also they would almost immediately forget every encounter with daemons, and since it is needed for the Holy Inquisition that no one ever knows daemons exists, it is perfect. Indeed, the main problem for the Inquisition to deal with daemons is "Oh well we defeated them. Now we need to purge that all 100k men strong imperial guards regiment and all its elite troops because they know the Dark Gods and their daemons exists. And then we'll need to brain-wash once more these Space Marines over there because we can't afford to purge them. Sigh.... Being an Inquisitor is such a pain, if only I had wonderfully strong soldiers that never remembers the horrors they see." So sell your guys to the Inquisition, it will be very pleased and perhaps you will avoid an Exterminatus on your home world for using forbidden technology. 

I think such combat robots might be usefull. Let's consider why. Firstly, today we're using flying combat drones that are really effecient to supplant conventional aircrafts. They can sustain much higher speed, because you don't have to care about a human suffering from g forces inside your drone. Nonetheless, even if they're pretty efficient they have the same problem all aircrafts got. When you're fighting in higly dense area, like forests, mountains, towns, these sort of drones tends to be less adapted. Secondly, you might think then "Eyh let's use flying drones with propellers, these would act like helicopters and works perfectly". Helicopters are far more adapted to urban environment for sure. Nonetheless that's the kind of hard to maintain equipement, I can't find my source anymore but I read somewhere on world building SE that helicopters had a ton of drawbacks preventing armies from having hundreds of thousands of these instead of using trucks. On top of that, even with no drawbacks, you're not going to fight inside buildings with such drones. And you definitely can't do it either in forests. So then another solution is using drones with wheels/tracks or perhaps many legs, but not humanoid shaped with two legs and two arms. Wheels and tracks ? Not adapted to difficult terrains too. Many legs ? Means more cost, will be more stable and more efficient than two legs robots. At least, robots with legs would have that advantages animals and humans got to move on almost every kind of terrain. But then why giving arms/heads/eveyrthing that defines a human shape to a robot ? Well perhaps for military it's no use at first, in combat situation a robot do not need arms, it can have turret mounted weapons most likely and accessories to supplant arms, it does not need a head either, or not the same one we human got. But outside of fighting ? Don't your drones have any other goal than just to fight ? A soldier does not fight each second of his life. He need to do things that could require arms, like building stuff (fortifications most likely), or transporting supplies, or doing some maintenance tasks, even help the civilians (don't forget today's armies are often used to provide assistance to civilians in case of natural disaster)s. Last point for me would be : Civilian use and war economy. If the army is producing drones for it's own purposes, it is very likely the civilian industry will produce drones to. If they are enough advanced, people would really like to have a robot with which they can talk and live. And I guess everyone likes more to live with something that mimics living beings (so cats or dogs, or even human-shaped robots) than with weirds robots looking like a tank. Would you like to talk to a tank in your dinning room ? If yes, then you're really hardcore sir ! But anyway this is not the point. If drones are produced by the civilian economy, esthetics factors (like humanoid shaped robots) needs to be taken into account for customers, thus having humanoid like robots makes sense. And when war will break out, all the robots produced by the civilian industry would make perfect second hand drones to use as military stuff. They'll just need to be refitted a little, like adding a new shape with a bit of armor, creating some programms to teach them how to fire, and give them small fire arms and here you are, cheap robots fighters coming from the civilian industry without any need to heavily convert your civilian factories into military factories. Easy isn't it ? Even easier than converting cars factories into tank factories. It would most likely give a great advantage in the case of a total war, to have at once a full stock of ready-to-be-converted robots. The best is, before any war breaks, the country using such method would be considered pretty weak "Eyh look at them they have such a small army, they are no threat to us." And then the war breaks, and millions of civilians robots are turned into fellow fearless soldiers, ready to fight for the mother/father - land. 

Some of these things can be changed by manipulating Nature, some can't. Let's analyse them one by one. We can't channel energy as spells through wands from our bodies This can simply be achieved by violating the law of conservation of energy, as you suggest. Then we'll be able to yield infinite energy without any being taken away from the body. We could also make it any form we wanted, leading to different kind of spells(not all, though). We can't make potions as described in the universe(but some of them we could, if science advances enough) Well, in our world, medicines are a kind of potion. In that sense, we can make potions, but not most of them, like the Polyjuice Potion. I'm doubtful if some could be made at all, like the potion which makes pictures move, 'cause that's not how pictures work. We can't teleport(Apparate) or use Floo Networks or Portkeys. This'll also require the violation of the law of conservation of mass-energy, or the attempted teleportation of a single person will destroy all life on earth, as the only way to really "teleport" is to convert oneself purely to energy and back into being at the destination. We can use some types of Floo networks(faxes and the Internet come to mind), but they're no match for really being able to send people though. Wormholes, if made possible, would also be a type of apparition, as the feeling described in the books could be similar to the one of travelling through a wormhole. We can't make other objects move telekinetically or change their physical characteristics directly Here I'm talking about the chess set and Transfiguration. Transfiguration will also require conversion to pure energy and back, or somehow being able to split any element to hydrogen and recombine to needed element. I'm not sure how you'd breathe life into the 'raised' object though. We can't make things out of nothing I'm not really sure how this one works, but your theory of the law of conservation of energy should come here too I suppose. We don't have things that have different sizes from the inside and outside We'll have to change the law of conservation of space - effectively allowing fitting a 787 Dreamliner jet inside a courier carton. We can't predict the future This'd require time travel. Perhaps someday we'll evolve into 4D or 5D beings or something and then this one will come in, but until then, no future predictions for you(reliable ones, at least). We can't talk to ghosts A ghost is just a lone soul, without a body. Can't blame Nature here. The concept of a soul is not natural; life is just the effect of thousands of chemical processes happening in sync inside living things - they stop, the soul's gone. So we could make a crude comparison to a radio that's on as alive and one that's off as lifeless. Basically nothing physics can really do here, it's not involved. We can't transform into animals This one's similar to the fourth or fifth one. Undefined behavior on recombination. We can't animate otherwise lifeless objects We do have a variant of this one already - robots. But they are 'alive' for a reason similar to the seventh one - a series of processes that make it possible. I'm not really sure, but my best guess here would be 'everything about the way living things work will need to change'. We don't have animals that breathe fire or anything similar This is similar to the first - we'll need to break the law of conservation of mass-energy. Any animals alive in the world simply can't absorb energy from their surroundings fast enough to project it out at that rate. And living things are carbon-based, which means breathing fire will burn them up from the inside. So I guess life will have to exist as non-carbon based - iron as a candidate, anyone? So I'll second what some others have said: depends on your definition of magic - but I don't think any single law will be enough - our world is too different and too complicated.
