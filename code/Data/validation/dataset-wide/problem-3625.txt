If I were to seriously train for parkour, I'd combine sport-specific strength work, sprinting, gymnastics, full-length parkour course runs, and parkour drill work. 

"That muscle." There's a classic quote about the power clean, attributed here to Charles Staley, that applies to your question: 

You only need to rest your muscles that long if you're doing a split isolation routine. If you're doing whole-body workouts, your schedule is fine. Many of the most successful and effective novice lifting programs (Starting Strength, StrongLifts, Madcow, Bill Starr) use a 3-day-a-week schedule, hitting all the muscle groups in every workout. The advice you got is specific to intermediate-level bodybuilding programs, or split routines where the legs are only worked out once a week. It is not necessary to follow such a program. 

My Program! Squat/push/pull/hinge/sweat In the past, I've instituted a basic powerlifting-based strength-training template for my friends (mostly women). (I watered it down from the novice program I was given by a friend.) They lift with me, using my barbell, squat rack, pull-up bar, and rings. I strongly encourage them to keep a workout notebook, and have found that compliance with this step is intimately correlated with long-term compliance and success. 

This optimizes learning, as well as the recovery and training effect of each kind of stress. (page 14, Tom Kurz, Science of Sports Training) One should also put technically complex lifts like the squat before simpler movements like the pull-up. The fast lifts (snatch, clean, jerk) qualify as skill work and should be performed even before form-dependent slow lifts like the squat. The order of the exercises you perform should match the priority of those exercises. The ones that go first will get the most energy during the workout and, it seems, the most recovery resources in the days after. Put what's important, technically difficult, and heavy in the beginning. For your purposes, I'd put the squats and overhead presses earlier in the workout, but otherwise the only reason to re-order them would be to prioritize one lift over another due to your preference. 

Specifically, this will determine each individual's ability to realize their maximum lifetime potential in specific types of athletics. From page 305: 

First, how did you realize this? Second, how many sets did you do more than normal? Did a single additional set cause trouble? 

A sample strength/conditioning circuit is as follows, repeated 3 times with 90 second rests between full rounds: 

I got the opposite effect: barefoot running is awesome and I prefer it, but it builds up my calves and can temporarily make them quite tight. Squats require a mobile calf and ankle. It may help with ankle stability and I wouldn't avoid barefoot running for this reason, but I don't think it helps with my squats. 

Get as strong as my totally-made-up minimum strength standards above by lifting two or three times a week Do sprints or similar all-out effort once or twice a week to get my wind in order Do a solo or at-home dancing workout that's just a little longer and a little harder than the dancing classes, once or twice a week 

Doubling up on the overhead press doesn't sound like a good modification to StrongLifts to me. I'd opt for dips (if you have two chairs, or rings, or parallel bars) done with three sets of max reps like chin-ups, or one high-rep set of Hindu pushups. I would focus on maintaining a non-bench-press, non-overhead-press pushing movement. Personally I would not go for the floor press because it's a limited-range-of-motion movement. If I did go for doubling up overhead press, I'd make the "overhead press as alternative to bench press" days into light overhead presses (70% or 80%) instead of full weight. 

I relax fully at the bottom of the pull-up. This ensures that I work the maximum amount of muscle. Mark Rippetoe suggests the same approach: 

The key phrase in that quote is how Arnold trained "as a beginner". His later programming was for bodybuilding after he had developed his base. His beginner programming was essential for getting him big and strong enough to bodybuild. Reg Park's program includes a lot of compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, dips, bench and overhead presses), but also a good deal of bodybuilding-oriented accessory work (calves, wrists). Per your specific questions: (1) it will get you bigger, (2) it does work opposing muscle groups (notice the pushes and pulls), and (3) it does do smaller exercises after bigger ones (notice the wrists and calves are after the squats, deadlifts, pulls and presses). 

People need protein for their current muscles as well as new muscle. From what I hear, people who are 280 pounds of muscle needs to do quite a bit of dedicated eating to stay at that weight. For instance, see Alistair Overeem, heavyweight MMA fighter, describe how much he needs to eat in order to stay as big as he is (and to sustain his training schedule). Or read about the effort just to maintain a high bodyweight in Matt Reynold's article, Eating Through the Sticking Points. 

It depends. Are you trying to get better at dancing? Or are you trying to be more fit? Your "increased stamina" could fall into either category. Or both. Better at Dancing If you want to get good at a thing, you need to do the thing a lot. So: dance more. Practice solo at home, preferably in doses similar in intensity and duration to the group class. Practicing longer or harder will make you better able to handle the shorter or easier demands of the one-hour class. At a certain point, you will get diminishing returns from this approach. If you're a really efficient dancer, it may be hard to expend enough energy to get tired quickly. Better at Fitness You say you're plenty strong, flexible and coordinated. I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm just saying you could be mistaken. (I used to believe the same thing about myself in my sport, and I was mistaken.) Being stronger makes everything easier. If you're able to lift a partner off the ground, great. But after three or four lifts, you're tired. What would happen if you were twice as strong? Lifting your partner wouldn't be such a big deal, would it? You'd probably be able to lift them twice as many times or more, since the difficulty of doing so is much less. You might benefit from getting stronger, which is most efficiently done by lifting weights. Squats, deadlifts, and chin-ups make you stronger very, very quickly. My recommendation is to get strong enough so that you can safely pick up a barbell weighting 1.5 times as much as yourself, and squat with a barbell weighing as much as yourself on your back, and do five or ten dead-hang no-kip full-range-of-motion pull-ups. You'll then be in a good position to decide whether being stronger is helping or not. You also might benefit from improving your metabolic capacity. Short, all-out bursts of effort like sprints, shorter CrossFit metcons, or kettlebell swings will make you very tired in short order. By making you more capable at handling very hard exertion, they will improve your ability to exert yourself on longer, slower activities like dancing. Side benefit: heavy lifting and sprint-type activities are also highly recommended for overall health and fitness. Recommendation If I were you, I would: 

My susceptibility to neck strains decreased significantly after I started focusing on overhead mobility. For me that meant overhead presses, overhead squats, one-arm overhead pressing while in a squat, plus—and this is important—all the mobility work necessary to support those exercises. I suspect that other methods of increasing stability overhead would help too, such as Turkish get-ups, snatches, and windmills. 

Bend my knees at a right angle, without crossing my ankles. Extend my legs in front of myself, as high as they go. You can do it like the picture, but you don't necessarily need to keep them as high if you're just looking to stop swinging. 

Presuppositions The presuppositions in this question are mistaken. A) It is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time if the conditions are right. B) It's not true that one should not change one's training program while cutting--one should still do some heavy lifting, but the program should change. The point of heavy lifting during a cut is to maintain (or lose as little as possible of) lean muscle or one's level of strength. It is indeed possible to gain muscle and lose fat, sometimes. Many novices do it, and some people find it possible in other training scenarios. It's hard, it can't always be made to work, but it happens. 5x5 While Cutting If you're trying to run a hypertrophy/strength program like SS or SL while not eating enough, you will hit walls faster than if you were eating enough to grow. That might be okay for you or it might not. 

Lowering a weight slowly then explosively curling it is doing a "slow negative". For fast punches and kicks you should be working on your basic barbell lifts: squat, deadlift, power clean, overhead press, push press. These are the best method for developing a high power output. Add in some fighter-oriented bodyweight and dumbbell work from Ross Enamait and you've covered all the bases. 

Not only is he bigger than you: you're weak, he's strong. You delineate exactly zero qualifications for victory. You have no chance except his charity. 

No. Different moves are different. Most notably, holding dumbbells up is not the same as pushing down on rings. 

Supplements Muscle Core X won't do any good. I don't know what's in it, and it doesn't matter. It could be anabolic steroids mixed with cocaine and it wouldn't make much of a difference for you, because what you need cannot be distilled into a powder. For someone just starting to work out, no supplement will do much good. Powders and shakes are well-advertised and quite profitable for the people selling them, but are indistinguishable from useless for someone just starting to get in shape. Save your money. Stop putting your hopes into consumer products. They will not save you. The only thing that can get you in shape is hard work, performed consistently, without excuses. The universe doesn't care that you work at a camp. The laws of biology and physics will cut you no breaks. You must overcome these obstacles. One month to get fit You can get in better (but not great) shape in a month--if you rearrange your entire life. But even the perfect workout schedule, Herculean effort, and optimal diet will only have moderate results. One month is simply not that much time. But you could change everything you do for one month and make a dent. Go to sleep early every night, wake up early to run a mile every morning, eat only real food with plenty of animal protein and good fats. Start doing sets of 20 barbell squats three times a week, keeping in mind that using imperfect form with heavy weight will cause injury but using only light weight will not produce change. Do fifty chin-ups each day, split up however you have to, and pray you don't get elbow inflammation. Learn to deadlift and bench. Run two sprint or high-intensity interval training workouts a week. Miss no workouts. Skip no exercises. Get perfect sleep, avoid all stress, get plenty of sunshine but no sunburn, and eat a perfect diet. (Remember that there are at least a dozen broad definitions of the perfect diet and they all contradict each other and the right choice depends on a thousand individually-nuanced factors.) If you do all of that perfectly, no exceptions, no injuries, no mistakes, then you'll be in somewhat better shape in a month. You won't be "in shape", it won't be a stunning, head-turning difference, but it'll be a modest improvement. As Earle Leiderman said: 

There's acceptable "grind" and unacceptable grind, and I don't trust novices to tell the difference. Someone in your position--which I assume means, a beginner doing a novice program with an unfamiliar exercise--should not try to make this distinction oneself, but rather get a trusted coach to review your form in person, or do an online form check using video and a forum one trusts. In general, if grinding just means a small deviation from perfect form, that can be fine. But grinding can also mean not hitting full depth, losing tightness at the bottom, "good morning-ing" the squat, tremendous "butt wink", and other significant and problematic form errors, and those aren't OK. 

My favorite uses of weights for cardio are heavy twenty-rep squats, dumbbell/kettlebell swings, and complexes. Essentially, more reps with less weight and continuous effort. Making circuits using weights plus bodyweight (e.g. the magic 50) works well too. Putting five to fifteen minutes of high-intensity cardio at the end of the workout doesn't take much time or equipment. In the end, though, the best method for controlling fat gain while lifting is to control diet. 

This approach of pairing or mixing can be extended to include any exercise you are capable of doing. For instance, I recently did 4 rounds of 10 one-arm dumbbell bench press and 10 one-arm dumbbell row. One can mix weights with bodyweight, as well: push-ups and bent-over rows, for example. What makes this so cardio-intensive? Short rests, using a moderate weight (or moderately difficult exercise), using the time spent doing one exercise to rest the muscles used in the other exercise, and doing several rounds. If you have those elements, you can get quite sweaty and out of breath with simple pairings. 

Being in shape helps prevent back pain. Being out of shape, overweight, and inactive all contribute to the problem. I would lift weights at least two or three times a week, focusing on barbell squats and deadlifts, which are both tremendously helpful for strengthening the back. Yoga, going for a medium-long walk, or another form of stretching that you enjoy would be good to do on days you don't lift. It would be fine to add running, swimming, biking, rowing, or another form of cardio once or twice a week, to help lose weight. The primary problem is probably a weak back, however, which is best addressed with a barbell. 

It's fantastically unlikely that there are any appreciable differences between the two. Regardless, I'm sure someone will find some minor dissimilarities to quibble about. When they do, remember that these are almost certainly insignificant. If the difference is significant, it's unlikely that you'll be able to get a hard-and-fast assurance as to which one is better. It's hard to conceive of a scenario in which choosing between melted and unmelted cheese--even if you made the decision and stuck to it for a century--would make the slightest smidge of difference in terms of your health.
