TLDR You're not providing any details, so it's hard to say what's going on. Based on experience, I'd say the most likely candidates are: If your scope is a dobsonian or an SCT, I would start with collimation. Learn how to collimate the scope, and do it regularly. It has a very, very large impact on observations of the Moon and the planets. Do this before you try anything else. If you're observing DSOs (galaxies, nebulae), maybe light pollution is the reason. Load up the scope in your car and drive about 1 hour away from the city, and try again. Learn how to focus the instrument. It could be trickier than it seems. Finally, go to a local astronomy club meetup and try and use an instrument similar to yours. Maybe your expectations are not calibrated properly. 

EDIT: TBH, I'm not even sure this is a question for StackExchange. It's very open-ended, and we don't really have the conclusive answers. All we can say for now is that the universe appears to be infinite for all practical purposes, but we can't know for sure. So often scientists like Hawking just simplify the language and refer to the universe as "infinite" without any of the qualifiers that would be required in a strict context. I don't think there's any single, final answer here. 

Further information on Thierry Legault's site, which is extremely informative. A series of articles and documents regarding collimation: $URL$ Gary Seronik: A Beginner’s Guide to Collimation Gary Seronik: Collimation Tools: What You Need and What You Don’t Gary Seronik: No-Tools Telescope Collimation Note: Some telescopes (e.g. pretty much all refractors) do not require collimation; they are collimated from factory and hold collimation pretty well. But most reflectors (SCTs, all newtonians including dobsonians, etc) do require this periodic maintenance. Thermal equilibrium At 3" aperture, this is probably not a big issue, but there's no reason why you should add another problem to the existing ones. Your scope should be at the same temperature as the air around it, otherwise its performance decreases. Take it outside 1 hour before you start observing, and that should be enough for you. 

This is a fairly loaded question in that it depends heavily on what a "hot Jupiter" actually is defined to be. What is "hot"? What is a "Jupiter"? In reality, there's a continuum of planetary masses and distances from their parent star, and in the literature you'll commonly see references to "hot Neptunes", "hot Saturns," etc. The predominant theory as to how giant planets form is that they first coalesce from rock and ice beyond the ice line, the distance from the parent star at which water becomes solid. This distance is approximately where Mars lies today in our solar system. What's surprising about "hot gas planets" is that they are found within this ice line, significantly within. This implies that after they formed their cores, they migrated closer to their host stars via some currently undetermined process (for which there are several good candidates, but for now let's assume that the existence of hot planets shows that at least one of these processes operates quite regularly). And what about the word "hot"? Well, for the planets that are closest to their parent stars, there is known to be a radius anomaly: The radii of these planets are significantly larger than models of giant planet structure irradiated by their host stars would predict. So I would define "hot" planets as gas giants whose radii are larger than what would be predicted by the standard models. Now that we got some of the definitions out of the way, there's the question of survival. When giant planets are close to their parent stars, they become tidally locked. As a consequence, there is very little energy tidally dissipated on the surface of the giant planet, the shape of the planet is fixed and there are little internal motions. However, the giant planet also raises a tide on its host star as well, and because it takes a lot of angular momentum to change the spin of an object with 1,000 times more mass, the host stars are almost never going to be tidally locked to their closest planet. The rate at which energy is dissipated within the star is highly uncertain, and this uncertainty is typically swept into a fudge parameter "Q," the quality factor, with lower quality factors reflecting more dissipation. "Q" is measured for certain bodies in our own solar system (i.e. Earth and Jupiter) and in some stellar binaries, but is highly variable from body to body, ranging from about 10 for the Earth to 10^8 for some stars. Whether a planet survives to be observed today depends on how long the orbital decay time, which is determined by Q, compares to the age of the system. For some systems, such as WASP-12b and WASP-19b, which feature highly inflated hot Jupiters, Q is estimated to be small enough to cause them to fall into their host stars in a surprisingly short time (< 10^7 years). One other possibility is that the gas surrounding the rock/ice core is blasted away by the tremendous amount of heat deposited into the planet. This leaves you with a relatively low-density planet that's somewhat devoid of iron, as the cores of giant planets form further from their host stars than the rocky planets. There are a few candidate close-in, Neptune-mass objects that may have been produced as a result of them losing the bulk of their atmospheres in this way (Example: GJ3470b). As for our own solar system, the formation of a hot Jupiter would have likely destroyed the inner solar system as it migrated close to the Sun, owing to the fact that it would violently perturb the inner planets' orbits. Additionally, the Sun would likely be enhanced in metals owing to the accretion of metal-rich material from this giant planet. While it's potentially possible that there was a hot Jupiter in our solar system before the other planets formed, it currently seems unlikely. 

If the DIY route is not appealing, try some ready-made scopes. Here are a couple suggestions of vendors (I'm not affiliated with anyone): $URL$ $URL$ Sort by price and keep digging. The mount will be a weak point, always, in this price range. Those refractors with tall, thin tripods tend to be very wobbly. It's a true hell to push the scope a bit this way, only to have the tripod rebound the other way - very annoying. You may have better success with one of those short, stubby 76 mm table-top reflectors. Tweak the mount until it moves relatively easy, but not too easy. Hold it with both hands and guide it to track the planet. It may actually work better than one of those tall refractors. OTOH, the focal ratio for this reflector is only f/3.9, which is awfully short (it's hard to control aberrations for such a short instrument, unless you invest in high-end optics). If you do get a refractor, get one of those with short legs. The nice thing about these cheap refractors is that they have a long focal length (large focal ratio), which helps keep aberrations low. 

It's a pretty common tendency to fix problems by buying more eyepieces, but that's rarely how it works in practice. There are a few steps you need to take before buying more glass. Collimation Check collimation first. This should be your first item on the list, full stop. The performance of the scope decreases rapidly when it's out of collimation (for solar system objects). Check the documentation that came with your scope. Also check these links: $URL$ $URL$ If the scope is not in good collimation, a new eyepiece is a waste of money. All the eyepiece does is magnify the real image generated by the scope in the primary focal plane - so if that image is out of whack, then no eyepiece will give you the performance you're looking for. Check collimation every time you use the scope. With practice, it will end up taking only a couple minutes. Seeing It varies with time and location. Sometimes it's better, other times it's bad. Go on the CDS site, search for your location and use the Seeing forecast; good seeing is represented by dark blue, bad seeing by light blue or white. $URL$ Plan your observations according to the forecast. Seeing only affects fine-detail objects like the Moon or the planets. It does not affect faint DSOs (galaxies, nebulae, etc) because your eye does not resolve fine detail on DSOs anyway. Thermal equilibrium If the primary mirror is not at the same temperature as the air, "local seeing" conditions (vortices of air on the primary) will blur the image. Take the scope outside 1 hour before you start observing and let it acclimate. For a scope 8" or bigger it's often a good idea to install a fan on the back of the primary to accelerate the process - but get everything else done first. $URL$ Light pollution Only affects DSOs (galaxies, nebulae, clusters). It does not affect solar system objects such as planets. The only remedy is to load the scope up in a car and drive away from the city. However, all Messier objects are visible in most amateur telescopes even from very light-polluted places like major cities. They just don't look as spectacular as from a dark sky place. Finding focus Make sure the scope is actually focused properly. This might be more tricky than it seems. Use a star nearby and adjust until the star is as sharp as possible. You could also make or buy a Bahtinov mask, which will give you proof positive of perfect focus (adjust focus with the mask on, until all 3 lines intersect each other in the center). $URL$ $URL$ 

Nemesis is a hypothetical companion to the Sun on a very eccentric, long-period orbit. The star supposedly returns every few tens of millions years, driving comets into the inner solar system and causing extinction events. Given our very stringent observational limits from infrared surveys (such as WISE), is its existence definitively ruled out? 

Stellar clusters around supermassive black holes are systems in which relativity likely plays a role. Currently, only bright stars can be seen in our own galactic center because there is a ton of neutral gas between us and the galactic center that obscures it. As a result, we only have a few "test particles" out of the many stars that actually orbit the black hole at close distances. Nevertheless, measuring relativistic precession may be possible for a star with one of the closest-known pericenter distances to Sagittarius A* (the central black hole in our galaxy), S2, potentially within the next few years once enough data has been collected. As to how relativistic effects can affect dynamics of the cluster, the precession induced by general relativity can suppress resonant interactions, including three-body resonances such as the Kozai. Depending on if these sorts of resonances are important compared to other relaxation processes, the relaxation time can increase significantly, resulting in the cluster evolving more-slowly over time. This can affect things such as the rate of mass segregation, tidal disruptions, and production of hypervelocity stars/S-stars. 

An object approximately the same size as Pluto, Eris, was discovered only 8 years ago (in 2005). Are there any Pluto-sized objects remaining to be discovered, and if so, how far away from the Sun would they have to be to not have been detected already? 

The most-widely accepted hypothesis at the moment is that Mercury was struck by a large impactor that removed a significant fraction of its mantle (I believe this theory was originally proposed by Cameron & Benz in 1987, and the qualitative theory hasn't changed very much). For planets that are close to their parent stars (such as Mercury), the collision with the secondary body likely occurs at high velocity due to the rapid orbit speeds there (> 40 km/s). As this is much larger than a typical rocky planet's escape velocity (~10 km/s), material is lost from the planet in these collisions. This collision is also more likely to be "grazing," as "direct hits" are rare, and thus the outer parts of the planet are preferentially removed. Because the mantles of rocky planets are primarily composed of silicates, which have a lower density than iron that resides in their cores, the collision results in a surviving planet with a higher average density.
