My question - which apparently turned into a micro-essay - is aimed at a more root cause investigation of the eternal favourite and discussed topic of why the Romans failed to conquer "Germania" when so few other areas posed an obstacle at the peak of its might. TL;DR: Why did Rome really not conquer Germania when the reasons so often given seem to apply to other conquered areas as well? See for example Why were the Romans unable to conquer Germania? My interest was rekindled by the findings at Battle at the Harzhorn which wasn't just surprisingly far east into Germania but also at a rather late date (just before the onset of the Crisis of the Third Century). I'm interested in a comparative analysis that, for instance, compares Gallia, Germania, Dacia, Britannia - and even Judaea if needs be - in terms of geography, climate, population (density and urbanisation). For example: 

I found this entry on the website of the Australian National University,which tells the interesting story of Thomas Muir, a dissident we might call him today of the United Kingdom. Entry on Thomas Muir Sentenced to Transportation, he settled in Sydney. This is where the Otter arrived and he indeed planned his escape, but not only was he not a stowaway, he travelled in collusion with her captain, Ebenezer Dorr. 

The cartoon, recently publicised by this tweet, has seven children dancing around a US flag. The child in the yellow shirt is intended to represent an African-American child. What races are represented by the six other children, especially the three children with black hair clockwise of the African-American child? Also, what races within the USA were the US government trying to prevent racism against during WWII? 

Did French ever have any special status in Austria or the Austrian empire, akin to it being the language of royalty in England (and possibly Russia, I'm not sure) (as opposed to it being just another foreign language)? 

Acts which nowadays are called cultural appropriation have been going on for a long time in the US, at least since the 19th century. But when did certain behaviours start getting labelled in the US as cultural appropriation and as a bad thing to do? 

I used to think older Japanese people wouldn't have studied English at school, and recently came across someone who thought likewise (link available on request). A middle-aged Japanese person told me that English became a compulsory subject by 1920, but I can't find any information online confirming that. (One site says that English isn't technically a compulsory subject nowadays, merely the teaching of a foreign language, which in most cases happens to be English - though perhaps English wasn't the dominant language in the late 19th century) When did English become a major subject at Japanese schools? If a definition is needed, then it being studied by a majority of students who completed high school, either of the entire nation, or of a particular prefecture. Also, did negative relations with some western powers before and during World War 2 lead to the reduction of English being taught, above and beyond the disruption to education caused by war in general? Yoshi Mori joked about English being an enemy's language for part of the time he was at school. The Wikipedia article English-language education in Japan mainly focuses on the private sector, plus modern-day education in schools. 

It may also go back to Johann Carl August Mutäus in the 18th century The term was also used derogatorily by people in other countries and was then warped, in light of German militarism and totalitarianism in the 20th century to Land der Richter und Henker (land of judges and executioners). The origins go back to enlightened, though still absolutist, monarchs like Frederick the Great. But it's also linked with the development of a Bildungsbürgertum, a bourgeois elite that saw education as a high goal. In this sense it took denken out of dichten und denken, focusing on its meaning of thinking and devising things. As @Michael Hardy wrote, this was supported by an excellent school and university system. It allowed the bourgeois to obtain high social standing through education instead of noble birth. However, lest this be thought as some great meritocracy 

I thought I'd turn my comment into a proper answer. My main source is Adrian Goldsworthy's The Complete Roman Army, a must-read/have for anybody who's interested in that topic, IMO. Originally, as @SJuan76 linked to, cavalry in the "Polybian" (i.e. pre-Marian reforms around 100 BC) Roman army was the charge of those who could even afford the cost of a horse and its and the riders equipment. These were the equites, who formed about 300 out of a legion of 4,200. The 300 were divided into 10 turmae and each of these was led by a decurion ("leader of 10"). Unfortunately, Polybius only stated that the cavalry fought with "Hellenistic style equipment" and assumes the reader knows what that means. The estimate is that these we close order units 

In this picture, someone has put up a sign saying "JAPS KEEP MOVING - THIS IS A WHITE MAN'S NEIGHBORHOOD". In case this was not enough, the window has a sign saying "JAPS KEEP OUT" and some other illegible sign. The photo is from around 1920, though lots of people assume it's from World War 2. What's the context of this sign? What did white Americans have against Japanese people around that time? 

In December 1967, then-serving prime minister of Australia, Harold Holt, disappeared while swimming at Cheviot Beach, Victoria. His body was never found, though an inquest held much later stated that the cause of death was drowning. Has such an occurrence happened in recent history, defined by being recent enough to have rapid communication such as the telegram and widespread recognition of what the individual looked like such as photography, to either a serving head of government, or a serving head of state, for any other country? I had a quick skim over List of people who disappeared mysteriously and "Real Life" in Never Found the Body in TV Tropes (warning: not productivity safe) and didn't find any other examples. 

Finally, Isidore of Seville left more than just the Etymologiae. In fact, according to the late Italian professor Umberto Eco: 

The Standard Model of particle physics got its name from the late Sam Treiman. It was first coined in 1975 when Treiman, together with long time friend Abraham Pais, published a paper in which they used "standard model" to reference the four quarks theory. 

It has thus been thought that the Pelasgians moved south through Achaean Greece, arriving at Crete and from thence onto Canaan to become the Peleset of Egyptian records. It could also have been that the Pelasgians were refugees from the Mycenaean Collapse, arriving in Egyptian territories as a migratory tribe. 

Most likely because it was signed by Sir Robert Howard of Ashtead, Surrey[1], son of Thomas Howard the 1st Earl of Berkshire. As a royalist, he was made Clerk of Patents in Chancery[2] in June 1660, presumably as a reward. He appears to have stayed in that position until 1664[3]. Letters patents, including royal charters, are not signed by the Lord Privy Seal. Instead, he formulates the draft into a Writ of Privy Seal and transmits it to the Lord Keeper. The actual document is then drawn up by the Clerk of Patents, who attests to the result with his own signature.[4] Connecticut received its royal charter in 1662, and Rhode Island in 1663. Both grants were apparently made during Robert Howard's tenure, which explains why they would be signed "Howard". 

So, very little actual evidence of wine-making in Britain during the Roman Empire and what little we have points to a very short abortive period. And no indication of just what wines were grown. However, indeed, wines grown in Britain around the 11th to 13th century were actually praised. A bit after the Romans though. 

That does not mean that any of them actually sat, never mind fought, on horseback. By this time the four-horned saddle also was around and Goldsworthy maintains that, contrary to some historians, this made up for the lack of stirrups when mounting charges or doing much of anything beyond harassment or skirmishing. However he doesn't explain why the Romans, who were extremely adaptable in all other military matters, then never raised the profile of their cavalry, even when their enemies used it to increasingly devastating effect. On a purely personal note, speaking as an equestrian myself, I think he is wrong here: the difference between having stirrups or not, regardless of the type of saddle, makes a huge difference in the effectiveness of a mounted soldier. Not just in the ability of the massive charge of the armoured knight from centuries later, but in the ability to be supported when shifting or leaning sideways and a four-horn saddle can restrict turning the upper body (such as the parting shot of mounted steppe archers). Of course, in late antiquity the Roman army was largely made up of foreign troops, many of them fully mounted, anyway. In summary, the Romans apparently never made the step, during professionalisation of their military, to also centralise the raising of horses and training them and the mounted soldiers. They left it to those who could afford it, whether their nobility or their allies. Italy isn't ideal for raising horses, but other parts of the Empire certainly were - e.g. Hispania, Cappadocia (which became the main source of horses during the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire). 

Some nationalities (for example New Zealand and Wales) are the butt of jokes about bestiality, especially with sheep. What lead to this? 

Not all Japanese-Americans were interned - Japanese-Americans in Hawaii weren't interned. However, for areas where the US were systematically interning all Japanese-Americans, how effective were the US at identifying and detaining them? I know that some tried to avoid it, such as Fred Korematsu, but don't know any statistics. 

However, when this was happening, large-scale, systematic killing on racial or religious lines also was happening. I'm not sure if this answers the question, because I assume the question asker is mainly interested in attempts at eliminating a race without large-scale killing being done. 

As far as I'm aware, in Australia, currently only countries which are predominantly made up of people not of European descent, such as China, are seen as a "threat" to Australia's manufacturing. Have majority European descent countries ever viewed other majority European descent countries as a threat to their manufacturing? I'm interested in both examples where the other country is seen as "inferior" (whether racially, religiously, or culturally), and where the other country is not seen as "inferior". 

Yet some writers treat modernity as more or less equivalent to economic development. Under this meaning, rising economic output offers a possible metric of modernisation in and of itself. Levy, for example, provides a definition that seem based off productivity: 

The Government provided the Company with an Annuity. From that, and the revenues of India, the East India Company were to pay dividends to its shareholders. By this point, the Company had effectively been finished. 

(1) Qajar dagger with ivory hilt "carved with panels of Qajar princes, with attendants, between stylised Islamic script" - Philip Carrol Antiques (2) ivory hilt inscribed with "the bending dagger in the hand of the Prince who dominates, is like a crescent (moon) in the hand of the sun". Other common inscriptions include Koran verses, prayers, or signatures by the artisans. However, it also appears that sometimes the "inscriptions" are actually just stylised scripts meant as decorations. Given that users @tohuwawohu and @moudiz said the inscriptions in the OP's images are not intelligible Arabic, this may well be the case here. 

Park Chung-hee was a military dictator of South Korea in the 60s and 70s. He was assassinated. His daughter Park Geun-hye, who at one point was acting First Lady of South Korea, was democratically elected president in February 2013. 

News that Saudi Arabia will allow women to drive has been in the news recently. It's been described as the only country that currently forbids women from driving, which makes me wonder about whether other countries recently forbade women from driving. I thought I once heard that during the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, Kuwaiti women took advantage of the regime change by going driving, which the Kuwaiti government forbade. However, I couldn't find any evidence of this online, including looking at Women in Kuwait or Women's suffrage in Kuwait, though mentions of women driving is mentioned here ("can women drive in Kuwait") and here ("Kuwaiti men should know that human rights goes far beyond 'being allowed to drive', 'dressing as they like' and being 'allowed to acquire education'.") Was this the case? Were women banned from driving in Kuwait prior to its invasion in 1990? 

He didn't invent this, of course. As early as the Han Dynasty, Sima Qian's pioneering Records of the Grant Historian commented on the demise of Wei, after which Qin conquered the rest of China in quick succession, that: 

Disclaimer: As has been repeatedly pointed out, this is a gradual shift that cannot really be pinpointed. Moreover, in my opinion, it hugely depends on how one interpret any of the several parts in this question. 

EDIT: I thought that Alexander assumed emperor-esque Persian royal titles, and a brief book glance seemed to corroborate. Upon further investigation that appears to have been a popular misconception. Thanks to @fdb and @YannisRizos for pointing it out. 

There's no established metric. There's in fact not even a consensus definition for modernisation - perhaps because the idea of modernity is itself quite elusive. A traditional definition is to treat modernisation as synonymous with westernisation. As Shmuel Eisenstadt describes, it is: 

Regardless, there is general consensus that the ancestors of the modern Romanians were Romanised during the Roman Empire, and for whatever reason, retained that Latin heritage. In this respects it is no different from France or Spain, which also remain Romance countries. 

Today, I heard about seven deaths attributed to an explosion of a bomb from World War 2: Seven dead as war bomb explodes in Bangkok scrap yard Hopefully, the last death or deaths that can be reasonably regarded as caused by World War 1 has already happened. What was it, and when did it happen? 

When seeing some documentary about the history of medical science in the middle ages, I got the impression that many doctors were happy to merely study the works of Galen, rather than do their own research, and that that was detrimental in the long run to medical science. Was this the case? Were there any other cases where books from classical times were detrimental to either the knowledge held in the middle ages, or to the rate of acquiring new knowledge? For the purposes of this question, don't regard religious texts (for example, the Bible) as delaying scientific progress. 

The section "Former Yugoslavia" of the Wikipedia article on War rape says that Serbs raped Muslims and Croatians with the intention to produce new Serbs
