I'm replacing my mountain bike soon, and have been looking at how to improve it as a work bike. Basically I want to weld some plates onto the frame to use as mounts for things. The stand bent shortly after I got it because it was in the way of the pedal so I got rid of it. So I want to weld a plate further back along the bottom arm for a stand as well. The other main ideas are to weld on some brackets to hold a dismountable car baby seat at the back, a pannier at the front and maybe a mount for a trailer. I've already made everything except the trailer, but I may not need a mount for that anyway depending how I decide to do it. Does anyone know how much abuse frames can take doing this sort of thing? It's a pretty thick frame so at this point I'm assuming it's not a close tolerance thing and I can safely do this sort of stuff, just wondering if anyone else has tried. I'll be arc welding, not gas. 

You can install almost any smaller wheels so long as the axles aren't too wide, I rode this 29'er bike around for a few days while trying to get my front rim fixed. But brakes would be misaligned if they're rim brakes, and since the bike is not designed for other sizes it's not ideal. But it will work. 

I'm doing a bunch of work on my bike today, and had an idea. My biggest speed killer especially downhill is air resistance. I have a mountain bike but I only ride on the road. I've been looking at my bike and it would be fairly easy to attach a piece of curved perplex from above the front tyre to a few inches above the handle bars. Motor bikes have little screens like this above the handlebars which seem to deflect the air over the riders head if he puts his head down, so for example I could smoke a cigarette on my last motorbike without the wind bothering me much. Has anyone done this? Or is there some reason it would be a bad idea? Update:- After quite a bit of messing around and testing it coasting down a hill with and without. I found that going downhill it does increase speed and comfort. However it's in the bin as totally unsuitable for the tropics since I am an aircooled gadget and when cycling hard into a headwind when I need airflow the most I don't get the same cooling as I do without it. So it was a total success in terms of the question (downhill) but no good for other reasons. 

Wheelies are about legs and technique so if you can reach the pedals and handlebars you can pull a wheelie on a mountain bike. But bunny hops need weight so that will be an issue for you since it's a matter of using your weight to get the bounce and momentum you need. Learning to wheelie (lift the front wheel) is fairly simple you get the bike barely rolling, put it in highest gear, and then push down hard on the pedal while pulling up on the handlebars. Keeping it going is a bit more difficult. I taught my 8 year old to wheelie using that technique but on a smaller bike. Be prepared to spin the whole bike upside down a few times when learning. But doing it this way you can't really get hurt since you're not going at any speed. Safety first! Don't take the picture too seriously, but practising on grass is a good idea for beginners. 

I have a touring bike which works fine. But when I shift to either of the two larger cogs on the front the chain hits the derailleur on both sides. Obviously it's because the cogs don't run straight but I'm unsure what my best options are. (It moves around on the smallest cog as well, but not enough to hit the derailleur) Can I bang this around judiciously with a hammer and fix it, or is it something that is a potential danger and needs service, or should I just take the derailleur off? If I take the derailleur off then I'll just have one front gear, but I could probably live with that. There's no bike service places in this country, nor do I have special tools. 

After 10 months my commute has gotten to the stage where it's quite easy and I'm looking for ways to maximise it as a workout and hopefully benefit more muscle groups. Currently it just seems to work my thighs. I don't have time to ride for fun, but my commute is an hour each way which seems plenty. If I wanted to spend more time I could do a stomach/calf workout instead. I would have thought it would use the calves but it doesn't seem to (I don't feel any burn in the calves). Ideally I would like to work my abdominals while riding. Is there any way I can do this? I have thought perhaps purchasing a weight belt so my stomach has something to push against but I'm reluctant to spend the money for something that might be useless and I'd have to wait a month for shipping. So my question is, is there a way to benefit more body parts than just the thighs while cycling? 

I commute every day more than that and I live well out of town. The only way to find out is to go ride the route. I tried a bunch of routes before I settled on the ones I use. I settled on them for many reasons, mostly to do with traffic, I'm on a bike, I more likely to run off the road in a car which is wider than a skinny bike so I don't worry much about the road. In terms of safety I find traffic to be the biggest concern, mostly because hardly anyone cycles and the drivers are not the best in any case. I use one route in the morning and a couple of different ones on the way home depending what time I leave town. If I leave early when schoolkids are going home I dodge the route with lots of schools and buses and take a longer route. But I learnt all this by actually riding the routes. 

I don't have a section that steep but I have a front wheel lifting problem on the last part of my commute since I have a lot of weight in the back pannier. No amount of leaning forwards stopped it when I'm fully loaded. So I drape a toolbelt over the handle bars which makes a big difference. The toolbelt weighs around 7 kg. 

Put it on the handlebars, it should be fairly easy since the bag will settle into place and the weight will hold it there. Drive carefully of course. I've taken a full crate of beer on my handlebars in my youth, much trickier to balance and you have to hold it with one hand, but I made it several times with no problems. A bag of rice would be easy. 

I've lost count of the accidents I've had. The best way for me to regain confidence is to wear safety gear. But I'm a very rough rider at any time. The safety gear gives me the confidence to go back to pushing limits. 

I have a very steep portion of my ride which has a sharp corner at the end which I need to slow down for. During the rainy season the only way I can do this is to use both brakes carefully AND put a foot down. I put my foot down with my calf against the pedal and apply pressure downwards. My old bike had very dodgy brakes so I started doing this. But even my new one which has excellent brakes needs this technique during the rainy season when the road is very slick. 

The only thing the other answers miss is that a rear brake is a heck of a lot of fun to have and adds a whole different dimension to handling and maneuverability. Obviously it helps stop in an emergency, but it also gives you other options in an emergency, allowing you to spin the bike in a skid, or slip through tight spots where you otherwise would not have the necessary angle. I wouldn't be typing right now if my back brake hadn't saved my life on more than one occasion first on motorbikes, and more recently on bicycle so I'm unsure if it's normal for cyclists to skid around. 

I have been looking at sizing guides because I'm contemplating ordering a new bike and found out that I'm the totally wrong size for the bike I actually have. I'm normal proportions and 5 foot 7, but according to the guide here I should be 6 foot 2. My issue is that my current bike feels very comfortable to me even though I can't stand flat footed if I stop the bike (just tried it now, I can only just put both feet on the ground at full stretch tip toes, it's a 29 inch wheel mountain bike if that makes any difference. Normally when I stop I just get off the seat and rest on one leg with the other foot on it's pedal. I have tried riding my wife's one which is a 26 inch and has the correct top tube length for me, but it feels horrible and I don't like the handling. If I was to buy a big framed bike am I setting myself up for health issues in the long term, or should I just go with what's comfortable for me and not worry about it?
