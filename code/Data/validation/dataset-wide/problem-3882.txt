Consider the Euclidean group $E(n)$ as the semidirect product for Euclidean vector space $\mathbb{E}^n$ with its orthogonal group $O(\mathbb{E}^n)$: $E(n)=\mathbb{E}^n\rtimes O(\mathbb{E}^n)$ Then the following short exact sequence splits $1\rightarrow \mathbb{E}^n\rightarrow E(n)\rightarrow O(\mathbb{E}^n)\rightarrow 1$ Now consider a subgroup G of the Euclidean group which translational subgroup T (all isometries in G with trivial linear part) can be identified with a lattice $\mathcal{L}^{n}$ in Euclidean vector space, i.e. all $\mathbb Z$-linear combinations of a chosen basis. The translation subgroup T is normal in G and we can write the short exact sequence $1\rightarrow T\rightarrow G\rightarrow Q\rightarrow 1$ where quotient group $Q=G/T$. This short exact sequence splits iff $G=T\rtimes Q$. This is the case iff Q is isomorphic to the automorphism of the lattice so that we can write for example the following split short exact sequence $1\rightarrow \mathcal{L}^{n}\rightarrow G\rightarrow Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n}) \rightarrow 1$ 

FYI: in crystallography, G are called space groups in three dimensions. Space groups which are semidirect products, are called symmorphic. Some thoughts that might lead to the solution: 1. Since T is normal in G we can write for every isometry $(t_q,q)\in G\quad$ ($t_q$: translational component, q linear component) $\quad\quad T=(t_q,q).T.(t_q,q)^{-1}$ $\Leftrightarrow T= (t_q,q).\lbrace (t,id)\rbrace.(-q^{-1}.t_q,q^{-1})$ $\Leftrightarrow T=\lbrace (q.t,id)\rbrace=q.T$ So q is a permutation of T. Since T is isomorphic (as a free $\mathbb Z$-module) to $\mathcal{L}^{n}$ and since q is orthogonal ($q\in O(\mathbb{E}^n)$), we find that $q\in Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$. This means that the set of all linear parts of G, which we'll call $Q(\mathcal{L}^{n})$ is a subgroup of $Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$. 2. Consider a coset $(t_q,q).T\ $ of T, then we can write $\quad\quad (t_q,q).T=\lbrace (t_q,q).(t,id): t\in \mathcal{L}^{n}\rbrace$ $\Leftrightarrow (t_q,q).T=\lbrace (t_q+q.t,q): t\in \mathcal{L}^{n}\rbrace$ $\Leftrightarrow (t_q,q).T=\lbrace (t_q+t',q): t'\in \mathcal{L}^{n}\rbrace$ which means that each q belongs to exactly one coset of T so that $Q(\mathcal{L}^{n})$ is isomorphic to $Q$. 3. From 1. and 2. we find that in any case (i.e. also when G is not a semidirect product) $Q$ is isomorphic to a finite subgroup of $Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$. 4. If we have $G=T\rtimes Q$, there exists a homomorphism from $Q$ to $Aut(T)$ and since T is isomorphic to $\mathcal{L}^{n}$ (as a free $\mathbb Z$-module) $Hom:Q\rightarrow Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$ 

In this question I had asked about proof of the property of selective ultrafilter. As was answered, the proof is trivial if we know that ultrafilter is selective iff it is Ramsey ultrafilter. The proof of latter fact can be found in book "Theory of ultrafilters" by Comfort and Negrepontis. Non-trivial part of this proof is the implication "selective $\implies$ quasi-normal". While it is easy to see that the proof of latter implication is correct, I was unable to understand intuitive idea of this proof. So, I tried to find more easy and intuitively clear proof. So, the question : Proof that for any selective ultrafilter $\mathcal{F}$ and for arbitrary family of big sets $\{A_i\}_{i\in\omega}$ there exists a big set $A$ with the property: $\forall i,j \in A : i<j \implies j\in A_i$ I will give my proof in answers below. 

Thanks to @AndreasBlass and @JingZhang for the answer. First of all saying "Ramsey ultrafilter" I meant "Every partition of $\omega$ into sets not in ultrafilter admits a selector in ultrafilter". So-defined ultrafilter better to be called selective. And Ramsey ultrafilter can be defined as follows "Every partition of $[\omega]^2$ into two pieces has a homogeneous set in ultrafilter". This two definitions are eqivalent, so termins "Ramsey" and "selective" are used as synonyms in literature, which led me to some misunderstanding. If we know that this two definitions are equivalent, the answer is trivial, what was noted by @AndreasBlass and @JingZhang. But proof of equivalence is not trivial in part "selective" $\implies$ "Ramsey". Proof can be found in the book "Theory of ultrafilters" by Comfort and Negrepontis cited by @AndreasBlass. 

How can I determine whether $A_1,A_2\in GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ conjugate in $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ and if they are, how can I find a $P\in GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ for which $A_2 = P^{-1}.A_1.P$ ? In $GL(n,\mathbb Q)$ one could achieve this by checking if the Frobenius normal forms (FNF) are equal and if they are $\quad\quad FNF_2 = FNF_1$ $\Leftrightarrow P_2^{-1}.A_2.P_2=P_1^{-1}.A_1.P_1$ $\Leftrightarrow A_2=M^{-1}.A_1.M\quad\quad\quad M=P_1.P_2^{-1}$ I found an algorithm which gives the FNF of a matrix with P a matrix of integers. Is there an way of performing subsequent elementary similarity transformations on $P_i$ (and hence also on $P_i^{-1}$) until $P_i\in GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ while also checking whether it is even possible to arrive at such a $P_i$? 

As far as I understood, the Fourier decomposition of a function $\boldsymbol{F}\colon\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{m}$ where $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is endowed with the Euclidean inner product $\left<\cdot,\cdot\right>$ is given by $\boldsymbol{F}(\bar{x})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}{\tilde{\boldsymbol{F}}(\bar{\nu})e^{2\pi i \left<\bar{\nu},\bar{x}\right>}}{d\bar{\nu}}$ where $\tilde{\boldsymbol{F}}(\bar{\nu})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}{\boldsymbol{F}(\bar{x})e^{-2\pi i \left<\bar{\nu},\bar{x}\right>}}{d\bar{x}}$ How does this come about and for which functions does it apply? I'm not even able to find the right framework to work in (Hilbert spaces?). Secondly, could I just replace the Euclidean inner product by the Minkowskian inner product when in Minkowski space? 

First of all we can assume with no loss of generality that $\forall i\in A_k~:~ i>k$, because we can replace $A_k$ with $A_k'=\{i\in A_k | i>k\}$. Let $f:\omega\to\omega, f(i)=min\{j\in\omega | i\notin A_j\}$. Thus $f(i)\leq i$. Obviously, $f^{-1}(j)\cap A_j = \emptyset$ and, so, there exists big set $B$ such that $f$ is injective on $B.$ My main idea is creating of big set $A$ with property: $\forall i,j\in A : i<j \implies i<f(j) \leq j$. Such a set satisfies the conditions of the statement. Now let construct finite subsets $P_k$ of $B$ as follows: $m_0=f(b_0)=min f(B), P_0=\{b_0\}$, $ m_k=min\{s\in f(B) ~|~ s>max \cup_{n=0}^{k-1}P_n\}$, $P_k=\{b\in B ~|~ m_{k-1}< f(b) \leq m_k\}$. We have $\coprod_k P_k = B$. One of $\coprod_k P_{2k}$ and $\coprod_k P_{2k+1} $ is big and partitioned with $P_n$ where n is odd or even. Applying selectivity we get big set which can be taken as $A$. 

It is easy to see (using AC, of course) that there exist two sets $U\subset\mathbb{R}$ and $V\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that any real number $x$ can be represented as unique sum $x=u+v$, where $u\in U$ and $v\in V$. There are $2^{2^\omega}$ such $(U,V)$ pairs. The question given by my son: prove existence of pair $(U,V)$ with $U=V$. In other words, prove the existence of $U\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that for any $x\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists unique pair $\{u,v\}$ with $x=u+v$
