Are you familiar with Hubble's Law? Because this is just it, in a slightly less familiar form. Note that the distance in this formula is the proper distance, the distance between us and some source, not the distance travelled. Other than that, the speed of light in a sense defines our conception of time and space, so it is mentioned in the formula. ;) 

As opposed to spiral galaxies, which are rotationally supported, elliptical galaxies are said to be supported by random motions of their stars. I don't really have an intuitive understanding of this. How do random motions prevent a collapse? 

I was reading up on compton radiation, and a question came up which I could not quite answer. Compton scattering is known to be less efficient at high energies, due to the fact that the Klein-Nishina cross-section falls off at the high energy end. This means that the Universe is more transparent to Compton radiation at high energies. What other processes could stop high energy photons from propogating through the Universe (i.e., a process that preferentially stops photons at the high-energy end)? 

"Life" seems to be an emergent phenomenon, a complex result of a very large number of simple parts or interactions. The whole is more than the sum of it's parts, unpredicted by the properties of the individual parts. If those individual parts are atoms and molecules, they have to move to be able to interact, to build larger, more complex structures. To move, they need to be suspended in something that permits movement and allows chemical reactions. On Earth, that would be liquid water. Other liquids might work, but they'd need to allow for the movement and reactions life requires. It's hard to imagine something other than a liquid doing the job. 

There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object. So yes, you can be still with respect to one object, but you'll be moving with respect to every other object. As for using it as a form of travel, letting your destination come to you, well, there's no difference between that and simply moving toward your destination other than the way you phrase it. 

Angular momentum, and in particular the conservation of angular momentum, is of course very relevant in many processes in astrophysics, such as e.g. star- and planet formation, and disk formation in galaxies. The concept of objects spinning up upon collapse is straightforward enough to understand, but this begs the question: where does the primordial angular momentum come from? Tidal interactions between haloes, I suppose? 

My question about this is the following: If we know the PSF of a system, and use this to deconvolve the raw image (purpose 1 from the quote above), why would we convolve a model with the PSF to compare it to an image (purpose 2 from the quote)? That is, can't we just compare the original, unconvolved model, with the deconvolved image? In terms of maximizing the information that seems like the way to go. 

This is typically a bit tricky to show because (1) some phases (e.g. the main sequence) are much, much longer lived than other phases and (2) a number of phases are spaced very close together in HR-space. Be that as it may: any elementary text book on stellar structure will guide you through the path of a star through the HR diagram, usually accompanied by pictures. The book by Prialnik on this subject matter, or Ostlie & Carroll, are both excellent. Here is a very crude version of the temporal path through the HR diagram I made some time ago. Numbers show the different phases (2 is MS), colorcoding shows the ages. 

Asking what they would do if they existed and if they had capabilities is really the realm of science fiction. There can be no good answer to your question at this time. Maybe later we'll know, maybe never. 

Probably not. You'd need a could of gas dense enough to contract under its own gravity. In the space between galaxies, matter is spread too thin for a solar-system sized cloud to exist. A much larger cloud could be more diffuse and still collapse, but being much larger, it would collapse into a galaxy. Even within a galaxy, stars seem to form when shock waves from nova or some other event initiates the gravitational collapse. 

Yes. By looking at a nearby object that hasn't been subject to erosion and has been subject to the same position around the sun, you could estimate the distribution of impacts on the Earth in time and in size. The moon is excellent for this purpose. Here's an article touching on the subject: $URL$ 

is there a way to infer the luminosity in X (or Y)? I'm think not because any information on units has fallen out through this definition, but I could be wrong. I'm just not sure how to compute the luminosity straightforwardly otherwise, as this color index is the only output (along with the distance modulus) from an interpolation scheme of stellar templates. Help would be much appreciated. 

This should be a straightforward exercise, but I'm struggling. Help is much appreciated I would like to parameterize a Navarro-Frenk-White profile with one parameter, using the correlation between total mass and the concentration. As a starting point, I have the density in terms of two parameters: the total dark matter mass inside the virial radius $r_{vir}$, and the concentration parameter $c=r_{vir}/r_{s}$: $\rho_{DM}(r) = \frac{M_{DM}}{4\pi A(c)}\frac{1}{r(r_{s}+r)^{2}}$ where the function $A(c)$ is given by $A(c) = \ln{(1+c)} - \frac{c}{1+c} $ Using the correlation between $M_{DM}$ and $c$ (from e.g. Napolitano et al. 2005) $c(M_{DM}) \approx 9.195 \left(\frac{M_{DM}}{h^{-1}10^{12} M_{\odot}} \right)^{-0.094}$ it should then in principle be possible to parameterize $\rho_{DM}$ as a function of $M_{DM}$ only. This is how they do it in e.g. Williams et al. 2009. However, I'm not managing to reproduce that. Sure, given the correlation above, $M_{DM}$ determines $A(c)$, but won't $\rho_{DM}$ still depend on $r_{s}$? 

"What happened before the Big Bang" is like asking what Alexander the Great's phone number was. It's a nonsensical question. Space and time began with the Big Bang. "When" and "where" began with the Big Bang. 

Kepler did know the orbital period of the Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. He had access to observations going back centuries, including Brahe's most excellent data. What couldn't know was the absolute size of the Earth's orbit, so the best he could do was give the size of the plantets' orbits in terms of the Earth-Sun distance, 1 A.U. Nobody else could do better for centuries. Using the transit of Venus across the face of the sun, timing the instant the edge of Venus "touches" the edge of the Sun from two different locations on Earth a known distance apart makes a parallax measurable, and the absolute distance between the Earth and Venus a matter of trigonometry. Kepler's Law lets us convert all the other relative distances into absolute distances. I believe it was 1769 when this was first accomplished. 

The definition of flux and flux density is fairly straightforward. However, I'm musing over the practical usage of it. For one thing, if you observe a source through a filter, how would one go from the total observed energy/number of photons to the flux per unit wavelength? It's not a matter of simply dividing by the width of the filter -- a filter can have any exotic form of course. So, how is this derived? Related, given a $f_{\nu}$ in some filter, what would be the way to go to total flux within that filter? 

I'm playing around with SÃ©rsic profiles, and would like to retrieve the effective (half-light) radius that I put in by integration of the profile. I'm not managing to, so perhaps someone can help me out. I create the profile using astropy: 

Whimsical question. Similarly, you could reason that someone on a planet far, far away would be holding up a mirror, such that we could see our own reflected past again. Unfortunately, both options are practically infeasible, even if the light would be undistorted and redirected perfectly towards us. Remember that (1) Earth is small, (2) the reflected signal is weak as it is, (3) any object capable of reflecting this back towards us would be a black hole, the closest of which is further away than most known exoplanets, and the signal falls of with $r^{2}$ with $r$ twice (!) the distance to the object doing this lensing. Now, if we somehow were able to observe it anyway, it would be straightforward enough to estimate the look back time - the distance to the lens would presumably be fairly well known. How bright it would have to be is not really a sensible question - there are too many variables in play for that (which (hypothetical future) telescope are we using, what are the observing conditions, how far away is the source, what kind of source are we talking about...). And at the end of the day, the brightness of your source is not even the biggest problem; finding a suitable lens is. 

If you're big enough and fluid enough, like an atmosphere, you would feel acceleration do to the Earth's motion. Hadley cells are patterns of warm air rising in the tropics, flowing north, and sinking at higher latitudes. The Earth's rotation causes this north-south flow to curve, causing storms to have that distinctive spin you see in in hurricanes. Alternatively, if you are an exceptionally long pendulum, you'd try to oscillate in the same plane. However, the Earth's rotation would make that plane appearto rotate with respect to the surface of the Earth. Called a Foucault pendulum, it was the first proof the Earth rotates visible from the surface. 

It's hard to say without some research, but I don't think the answer really matters much. Both constellations are chance alignments that have little or nothing to do with how close the stars really are to each other. It's not hard to envision a constellation composed of a few nearby stars and a few galaxies millions of light years away. 

If a matter distribution is spherically symmetric, the circular velocity is straightforwardly related to the mass via: $v_{circ} = \sqrt{GM/r}$ In an axisymmetric potential, on the other hand hand, we have $v_{circ}(R) = \sqrt{R\frac{d\Phi}{dR}}\neq \sqrt{GM/r}$ with $\Phi$ the gravitational potential. What I don't quite understand is the following: the potential of the Milky Way is not spherical. How is the measured velocity then reliably related to a mass? 

Crucially to your question I think, you must remember that photons do not experience time and their speed is equal to $c$, the speed of light. Photons are not unaffected by their movement through a gravitational field, mind you: but this shows up as a gravitational redshift (for a time-varying potential), rather than a time delay (other than the slightly elongated path, perhaps). Besides that, the age of the Universe is typically not quite measured as you say, but rather through parameter estimation in e.g. the cosmic microwave background. The effect of gravitational lensing needs to be taken into account for that, but not in the way you presume. Also, remember that an extreme gravitational field such as that of a black hole is relatively rare, and even if it did delay the photon for a 1000 years that is still a tiny fraction of the age we would, according to your way of thinking, infer; the photon would have to encounter a LOT of such black holes for this 'effect' (which does not occur) to have a huge impact. As a general point, you seem to have some (Interstellar-induced?) misconceptions about the universe, but I think that's not for me to address here.
