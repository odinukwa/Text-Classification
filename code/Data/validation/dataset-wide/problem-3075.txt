Summing it up: human sacrifice has disappeared due to political and ideological developments that have replaced the role of religious violence with a new religious, political, judicial and military order. This trend was both expressed and encouraged by a second factor, the developments of the religious discourse itself, which became explicitly anti-sacrificial: in some Greek myths, in the Jewish religion, in the Persian religion, in Hinduism and Buddhism. The presence of human sacrifice in certain cases can be explained by the lower presence of one or both of these two factors and/or by a contrary development (the Aztec case) where increasingly powerful political institutions have stimulated sacrificial practices instead of replacing them. 

It all depends on the meaning of the term and on the period, considering the differences between annulment and modern divorce. Marriage became a sacrament only in 1215 with the Fourth Council of the Lateran, after a period when there were no marriage contracts and marriage could be dismantled (according to the French Wikipedia article on history of divorce). The church opposed this practice but had difficulty in imposing its views even after 1215, as the answer on the Spanish cases shows. Annulment and divortium in the sense of "Séparation de corps" were practiced as an alternative to the divorce in the modern sense, as they preserved the sanctity of marriage. Remariage seems more problematic, notwithstanding the Spanish cases. But practically one can imagine that it was not impossible, the farther one went from the location of the previous marriage, given that centralized records were absent. In a larger sense, divorce seems much older in European countries than the dates posted in answers here in relation with England and Prussia, which invoke modern legislation. More or less amusing, one reason for the mariage to be annulled was sexual impotence, which (at least in France) needed to be proved or disproved within the ancient judicial institution of Congrès. Quick translation from French Wikipedia: 

As such arguments are more philosophical than historical/archaeological, they are all controversial, but they may help provide a few basic terms with which an answer could be formulated. For example, on the place of sacrifice in the evolution of religion, an interesting theory is that of René Girard; he considers religion as the first real human institution and as the capital means through which humans have come to terms with intestine violence. Girard considers intestine (or "mimetic") violence an essential aspect of human societies and sacrifice as the primitive way to control, re-direct and so to speak "domesticate" the violence of human societies. Also, he sees an anti-sacrificial trend in the evolution of both religion and human societies. Religion and violence became separated, violence came to be seen as anti-religious or as exceptional. On the way "primitive" religion is gradually replaced by a religion that is controlled by political logic and institutions, a very philosophical (in hegelian terms) but interesting book is The Disenchantment of the World by Marcel Gauchet. It analyzes how political power has its own logic that gradually replaces "religious" logic, how the city states and the first empires impose changes of the religion itself, and of the very meaning of religion. Gauchet is not interested in the violent aspect of religion but the two theories can be used together in order to understand how elements that initially were mingled together (sacred, violence, power) gradually became differentiated. A different theory on religion, that of Mircea Eliade, confirms to a point this perspective. When he considers the "essence" of religion, namely the "sacred", he understands it in philosophical/ontological terms, far from the violent/sacrificial aspect of Girard's theory; but for Eliade, like for Girard, to understand the "ground zero" of religion and the "religious" in its purest form is to go back to the most primitive forms of religion. And when Eliade analyzes the religions of Romans and Greeks (and of other city-states and empires) he points out the fact that the most primitive aspects have disappeared to a great extent or have been re-interpreted in a context that (in this view) is less "religious". This confirms the perspective described above, where we have an evolution of religion in relation to institutions that gradually free themselves from the strictly religious and impose a new world with new meanings (what Gauchet called "the Disenchantment of the World" and Eliade calls desacralization). These new meanings have gradually started to include more and more aspects of what we now see as politics, justice, philosophy and science, while keeping a lot of religious "packaging" all the way. 

On the other hand, one shouldn't forget that the question is about the survival of the language, not of the people. The present Romanians were not isolated from their neighbors. Romanian is a Romance language but the only one with significant Slavic influences. These influences were much more present in the vocabulary at the beginning of the 19th century than they are now (especially in written language; most of the population was then illiterate, the political and religious elites used Slavonic; Cyrillic alphabet was used until mid-19th century). (And the influences came both ways. I am not expert in Slavic languages, but "месец" ("mesetz") means both "moon" and "month" in Serbian, while in Bulgarian it only means "month"; the Bulgarian word for "moon" is "луна" ("luna"), like in Romanian (and Latin). On the other hand, just like the Serbs (and unlike the Bulgarians, English and... Latin), albeit using a Latin word, Romanians have one single word for "month" and "moon".) Also, it is interesting to consider that languages of the Balkan cultural and geographic area share certain common features that are independent of their Indo-European or Latin ancestry: the presence of a linguistic Balkanic continuity or unity - the Balkan sprachbund. 

The question can be put like this: In case the "immigrationist theory" is true, how did Romanians/Vlachs became the vast majority in Transylvania? The simplest answer is that there were too few Hungarians there when Romanians (slowly) arrived, that not many (Hungarians) came and stayed after that, and that those who did come to stay moved slower than the (slowly migrating) Romanians; if Hungarians were a majority at some point, too many of them left and/or too many Romanians came to stay. Can it be so simple? 

The 19th century Romanian national independence, unification and modernization coincided with a (re)discovery of the Latin identity, which gradually became the main marker of national identity. The French influence was enormous between 1850 and 1900, both culturally and politically (pushing against the receding Turkish and the increasing Russian hegemony), and contributed to a re-latinization of the language - both directly (through the adoption of French terms) and indirectly (through the adoption of Western and Latin referents of cultural identity). Only then Romanians started to view themselves as closer to Italians and French then to Bulgarians and Serbs, a trend that has its part of artificiality but is again very dominant (after the fall of communism and the renewal of pro-Western influence in that part of Europe). 

UPDATE in relation to an answer that tries to dismiss the topic of the question arguing that Romanians are not the main Latin/Roman cultural phenomenon of the Balkan area, and that the same question should consider other peoples, like the Croats: The argument considers as "Latin" or "Roman" other facts than the neo-Latin language: 

As this regards an obscure period of European history, all we can hope is speculate within the bounds of reason. It might prove useful to consider the larger issue of the Eastern Romance substratum. As Oldcat answer points out, the insular position of the Romanian language might be seen as the result of a survival as part of a larger Latin region. From this perspective, the answer to the question comes from clarifying that the exclusive "Roman-ness" of Romanians in the Balkans in not their doing, but rather the result of larger Slavic influence and presence south of the Danube. Slavs (that is: Slavic-speakers) were also present on the territory of Romania but probably in somewhat smaller numbers. Why were there more Slavs south of the Danube then north of it? And even so, weren't even more Romans south of the Danube, where the Roman presence was older, than Slavs? Let's speculate. 

The article is from the Grand Dictionnaire Universel of Pierre Larousse, of 19th century. The practice seems to have been abolished in 1677. 

(Two powers might have played a decisive role in this obscure period of history: the Bulgarian empires and the Hungarian kingdom. The tzars of Bulgaria possibly extended their realm north of the Danube, which may raise the possibility of some movement of population. But the north of the Danube seems a territory of great instability and invasions all the way, and there is no proof of great effort from Bulgarian tzardoms of creating a stable political state north of the Danube, in the absence of which it remains greatly improbable that people could have had any incentives of moving northwards in the path of danger. There is on the other hand proof of Hungarian effort in this sense, which culminated in the creation of the two principalities at the beginning of the 14th century, after the end of the last great Mongol invasion and the stabilization of the Golden Horde north of the Black Sea. This Hungarian intervention involves no population from south of Danube, but most probably local and Transylvanian.) 

As for Crimea, for all of these territorial changes and/or disputes other specific/local reasons may be found, but I think that all these cases may be considered through this logic. In the case of Ukraine/Russia, territories had been also transfered from Ukraine to Russia, as seen here. 

The same answer, while pretending to clarify the issue, brings further confusion by presenting as a significant point the fact that 

The answer would be that monarchs came out of more primitive religious figures (shaman kings, magicians) before the development of what we call "politics". With the creation of larger communities and the interactions between them in military and political forms, this primitive monarchy suffered changes that brought it closer to what we know from historical times. 

As stated in the Wikipedia article linked above: "Because of the gradual disintegration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th century, the last voivodes of Transylvania, who came from the Báthory family, ceased to be high-ranking officials. Instead they were the heads of state, although under Ottoman suzerainty, of a new principality emerging in the eastern territories of the kingdom. Accordingly, Stephen Báthory, the voivode elected by the Diet of the new realm, officially abandoned the title of voivode and adopted that of prince in 1576, upon his election as King of Poland." But the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania should not be seen as the result of a separation from Hungary, as much as the result of an effort of Hungarian elites to safeguard some autonomy against the Ottoman but also Habsburg power. John Zápolya, the last Voivode of Transylvania within the unified kingdom and the first independent ruler of Transylvania, acted in the latter case as a King of Hungary. His intension was to act as a conservator of the Hungarian crown, a title which was successfully disputed to him by Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, the late king's brother-in-law and brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The separation of Transylvania from the rest of Hungary after the defeat against the Turks is partly the continuation of a previous autonomy, but much more the new result of the balance of power between Habsburg, Hungarians, Polish and Turks. What aligned for a while the Principality of Transylvania with the two Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia were military and geopolitical reasons which determined them all in the same way and forced them to play a double or even triple game between Poland, the Ottomans and the Habsburg. The Archduke Ferdinand anticipated that an independent Transylvania would be tempted to rally with the Turks in order to keep its autonomy, and this was confirmed by the future state of affairs. On the other hand, Trasylvanian rulers seemed to have considered the Habsburg rather than the Ottoman as the main menace, against which they used Polish as well as Ottoman influence, and even adopted Calvinism. They anticipated in a way the fact that a full victory of the Habsburg against the Turks would lead to the full integration of Hungarian lands into the Habsburg empire. This was confirmed by the fact that the collapse of Ottoman power in the region with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 lead to Rákóczi's War of Independence (1703–11) and the end of the relatively independent principality.
