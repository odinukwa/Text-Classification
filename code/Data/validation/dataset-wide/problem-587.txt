I've got this exact case on my road bike. 23mm tyres were too horrible, 25 were better, so I went to a 28mm tyre and I have about 1.5 mm of space between the brake bridge and the rolling outside of the tyre. And its not caused a single problem in 500 km of riding to date. The only way it could cause a problem is if your tyre was bulging from being off the clincher-hook, or if something was stuck to the tyre, like mud or snow or similar. Mount the wheel properly - that's the single most important part of this answer. Then deal with the fag-paper clearances if it becomes an issue. 

First consideration is that it may happen again. So you need to plan some precautions before parking up your bike. 

Seems that the answers are all yes, no and maybe at the same time $URL$ Summarises to "they're close but not the same, theres a different profile on the two models of pad." You're unlikely to get a refund, so if they work for you then all good. Do remember to get the right ones next time. Given they're only 6 euros you could just buy them.... pads are cheaper than rotors. 

Sugru might be a workable fix, but would likely cost as much as new hoods in the first place. Wrapping bar tape around the existing hoods may help, as long as it doesn't foul the movement of the levers. Riding without hoods is a bad plan, because it increases the dust and water incursion into the brake mechanism. Also you're able to pinch your skin accidentally. If the levers are absolutely fine, replacing the hoods seems wise. If the levers are getting a bit worn and sloppy, then its not a lot more to replace the whole lever. Remember these are not expensive items and as such are probably unserviceable. If they were $150 Shimanos or $500 Campag levers then repair makes a lot of sense, but these are not worth spending a lot of time on. 

I'd reduce riding as much as possible, and either replace it or go talk to a competent frame builder for a repair. The more you ride on it, the worse it will get over time, even if that crack doesn't appear to change. Less frame repairing means it'll cost less sooner, leaving it later may mean more work which will increase costs. If you like the frame then its worth looking after and repairing.... you're unlikely to find another identical frame, and it may have the same problems over again. 

I flatted the front wheel going up a climb the other day - I heard the pop and the PSSSSHH, and I could see a geyser of pale "steam" or vapour coming out the puncture. I swapped out the tube for the spare and continued, but noticed the tube was wet inside the tyre. It hasn't rained on my bike for months. When I got home I patched the tube, and noticed a lot of dampness around the hole. When inflated it bubbled like a mud pool. The tube also felt squishy and I couldn't push all the air out when stowing it later. I guessed there was some water inside, so the tube was left hung up with the presta valve at the bottom and unwound. 8 hours later this is what it looked like underneath: 

The lowest clip goes near your rear dropout, which is a fixed location on the bike. The two top clips are also somewhat fixed in they have to be evenly before and after the bottom clip, and share the load. If you extend your carrier rack, it won't move your pannier unless you change the clip locations as well. So the red one pictured above can be adjusted with screwdriver to move the hooks, or you might be looking at saddlebags that look something like these, which clip under the carrier's clamp and are held on by equal weights on both sides. 

You have an Alivio rear derailleur, and an 8 speed cassette, which means an 8 speed chain. Your bike frame has a replaceable rear hanger (the silver/chrome bitbetween the black derailleur and the bronze-painted frame. Is the problem shifting between gears, or is the chain jumping under load? If its shifting probs, then most likely it just needs a tune up rather than replacement of parts, and that's free other than your time. The cassette shows some wear but maybe or maybe not be the root cause. If you push hard to go and the chain lurches forward, then its skipping and you likely need a new cassette and chain. 

XT is shimano's MTB line - and its second below the XTR line. It weighs a claimed 275 grams, and can be split in the middle to remove a medium cog and add a larger one on the end. HG is also a MTB line, but ranks somewhere below XT. It weighs more at around 430 grams, and therefore is more solid. It cannot be tweaked, but will be more robust and less prone to breaking. In 2016, the Shimano MTB group lineup is something like this: Lowest TOURNEY, ALTUS, Acera, ALIVIO, Deore, Deore LX, Deore XT, XTR Highest By comparison, the road groups are Lowest A050, Tourney, Claris, SORA, TIAGRA, 105, Ultegra, DURAACE, Highest A further breakdown can be found at $URL$ 

I do both - my road bike is a lightweight lean machine with no mudguards so its fast but terrible in the wet, so dry days only. My wet-day bike is a rigid MTB with full mudguards (fenders) and much better rim brakes. The MTB also has a more upfright seating position so its easier to look around, and puts my head a little higher. Road bikes commute fine, but its easy to go fast and get to work all hot and sweaty. So change of clothes, and you may need a shower there too. My MTB has a carrier rack and trailer towball as well, so if I'm moving stuff the MTB is the only choice. Backpacks are okay for small light things, but they make you sweat more, and they do make injuries from accidents worse. 

I spoke with the bike's previous owner, and he confirmed that the tyre was never filled from a compressor, always used a floor pump or a minipump which takes air from the atmosphere, so little chance that water went in via the pump. The tube was a self-sealing CST tube, worth around double the cost of a normal tube. The brown poop liquid IS the sealant liquid in this brand of tube. It was no more than a couple months old as well, fitted to sell the bike. I'd guess self sealing road tyres are a bit useless based on this. Accepting this answer because it came from the previous owner. 

Its highly possible your RD was "plinking" into the spokes as well, which is very close to catching a spoke with the RD and then its all badness. The other prevention is to use a Spoke Protector, which is a clip-on ring that sits between the cassette and the spokes. 

Finally here's what I made, usiog some old scaffolding cross braces. Theres an old concrete umbrella stand at the bottom of the pole, and all my tools can sit in the rear of the car for easier access. Only problem is the bike wobbles about if you're leaning on a spanner, but it provides easy access without bending down. 

Maybe don't tighten them up so much next time? Can you use fewer of the rubber doughnuts on the bolt? Or replace the middle doughnuts with a short piece of tube? Are you wedded to these handgrips - you might find a new replacement with a better mounting system. Final resorts: if you're handy might be to remove the axis bolt and doughuts completely, and drill a small radial hole through your bars and through the plastic end. Then use a suitable tiny bolt or a screw from each side to retain the end. Do you have straight bars? Could you use one really long chicago bolt all the way through to hold both ends on? 

A Crankset is both crank arms, a spider, the chain ring or rings, and the bolts holding the chainrings to the spider. If the BCD (Bolt Circle Diameter) is the same, then you can simply swap the chainrings over. Swapping the crankset means you need more specialised tools, and the bottom bracket standards may have changed over time meaning they're possibly incompatible. Either way you might need to adjust your Front Derailleur, and depending on what the donor bike was, you might find the new chainrings are narrower (10 and 11 speed maybe) whereas your bike looks like a 2004-2009 brand and might be 8 or 9 speed, therefore a slightly wider chain. 

All I can tell you is that its a 90s or early 2000's bike. Get a magnet and see if there's any attraction to the downtube, and to the forks. If so, its steel. Then take out the seat tube and look down with a torch/flashlight. If its dull silver, the frame is aluminium/alloy. If its plastic then its carbon. Weight might also help show what its made of - carbon is lighter than aluminium is lighter than steel. Details The seat tube has a long curved rear section to confirm to the rear wheel, making it an aero frame built for speed. Likewise, the downtube is not round - it looks to have a boxy profile, again for aero advantages. Conversely, the gear and brake cables are externally routed. So its either a lower end frame, or predates when that became common in the 90s. The pedals fitted appear to be clipless of some sort, which also suggests a racer. Brakes look to be dual pivot, but the terrible paint job doesn't help. Saddle will be non-original because its not a racing one, and the seatpost is now fitted the wrong way around so the most recent rider was probably too small for the frame. Note: Storing it like that, leaning the whole weight on the chainring is bad. Please hang it or put some wheels on it. Next I'd try removing some of the paint and look for decals, URLs, or a head tube badge/logo. Hot Soapy water would be a good safe starting point. 

Another option is to find a bike coop in your city and ask for some assistance. Wheel bearings are straightforward fixes. If you don't feel that you can do this, a bike shop can change your bearings for half the cost of a new wheel. 

STOP RIDING THAT BIKE I'm concerned that your bike has internal problems and that something may fail rapidly (ie, you're experiencing the warning now) You need to inspect the front steerer tube and head tube looking for anything wrong. 

I'd go the other way, and suggest that you do store the bike inside. If that means removing something else to make space, so be it. Other options include a ceiling hoist, where you sway your bike up into otherwise underutilised space below the ceiling. Watch out for air hotspots, and you have to wipe down a wet bike first because of drips. I have also seen these used to store a bike safely over a car's bonnet (hood) Think three-dimensionally!

Finally - it might be a good excuse to go buy one of those endoscope cameras... I've wanted one of them for a long time but never had a justification. You could whip out the headset and look along the tube to see what you see. 

I've got a folder and had similar problems with top end speeds. I can't speak for the IGH specifically, but increasing the front chain ring size and/or decreasing the rear cog will help with the ratios. The freewheel I had was 14-28, and that's all that was available in 6 speed. So I rebuilt the rear wheel onto an 8 speed freehub axle and have fitted an 11-32 cassette and 8 speed shifter. If you can fit a larger front chain ring then all your gear ratios will move proportionally. Finally, you can get a very minor improvement in top speed by increasing the rolling diameter of your tyres. Downside this will probably increase their weight too, which won't help. Lastly, consider that a folder is not a racing bike and remember you're still going faster than walking.

From $URL$ where there's analysis of all three approaches. Any geared bike can climb this, provided you can push the pedals - that is, the only thing that will stop you is running out of leg muscle in your bottom gear. Since you imply you've done this before, I guess you're asking how to do it better. Tyre choice - Assuming you're not changing rim size, then you're asking about width and tread. I'd recommend the thinnest tyre that your rims will support. This may be a commuter tyre with a 1.25" width and as smooth a tread as possible. Knobblies are less suitable. Pressure should be at the upper end of the supported range for your tyre. Descending at speed - I have higher peak and average speeds on my MTB than I get on my road bike. So the wider handlebars of a MTB will give more stability and confidence. Braking technique helps - you need to corner cleanly and stay well to the correct side of the road. Brake hard on the front with your bum backwards to wash off speed, then lean into the corners, and power on to exit them. Keep the eyes aimed at where you want to go, not the road in front of you. Do not ride the brakes - you'll get better effect from 2 seconds hard brakes on then 2 seconds off than you would from continuous dragging on brakes. You can also sit up and use wind to slow you down a bit. Most of all, don't ride like a prat. Your bike appears to be a single-sided fork on a rigid MTB diamond frame, maybe with a small damper in the headset. I have no experience with single sided forks, but for the climb you'd want to lock out any suspension, and "lower" it if possible. For the road descent you may want to re-enable the suspension, I've got no experience, so no opinion either way on this. Also, your single-sided fork.... Again I've never ridden a bike like this, it should be fine, but there are many increased forces at work. I suggest you do some more research on this. My other suggestion is to not ride the MTB. See if you can hire or rent or borrow a suitable road bike and see how it compares. When I went from a 17KG rigid steel MTB to an 11KG aluminium road bike, my climb times dropped by 15-20%. They didn't feel any faster, so I have to rely on strava to show me my improvements. Your other technique will be pacing - don't blast up the first climb and run out of herbs, learn your maximum sustainable pace, and methods for keeping to it.
