I take this definition as basis for my answer. All mental properties are embodied in the neuronal connections and theír weights in the neural nets of the brain. They make up the memory, taken in a broad sense. 

The role of time and space beeing containers or relations have been discussed controversially in physics. An excellent review of the different viewpoints, e.g., Leibniz, Newton, Mach, Einstein, is Chap. 3 "Relativity and the Absolute. Is Spacetime an Einsteinian Abstraction or a Physical Entity?" is Green, Brian: The Fabric of the Cosmos. 2004. According to the Special Theory of Relativity one has to consider spacetime. Only the combined concept has an objective meaning, independent from the observer. According to the General Theory of Relativity spacetime is a physical entity because it is affected by mass distributions. Big masses like the sun or black holes warp spacetime in their neighbourhood. That's a step beyond Ernst Mach. Summing up, Greene writes concerning acceleration 

But a representative of realism like Kant emphasizes that we cannot know anything about these physical objects outside - he calls such object a "thing-in-itself". In particular Kant would reject the concept of an "essence" of such objects as a useless concept. Contrary to Kant, a philosopher like Aristotle emphasizes the usefulness of essentialism. He names the essence of an object "causa formalis". 

What is a computational ontology? Ontology identifies entities and their relations which are relevant for a certain domain of investigation. A typical example are ontologies in the medical domain. Philosophical ontologies strive to capture the most general entity types, which are relevant for all scientific domains. The study of such ontologies has been started by Aristotle introducing ten 10 categories (= entity types). If I consider "computational ontology" as dealing with ontologies in the domain of computer science, it would denote the methods how to create ontologies for modeling. Since several decades the prototype of this kind of computational ontology is named "entity-relationship-modeling (ERM)". It deals with concepts like entity type, instance of an entity type, possible attributes of an entity type, lifecycle of entity types, relationship between entity types, cardinalities of such relationsships etc. A follower of ERM is class-modeling, which enriches the ERM by the operations used to process a given entity. A formalization of class-modeling is the class-diagram of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). For a general reference to ontology see $URL$ 

Considering atheism the null-hypothesis seems a nice metaphor, but not a serious characteristics. One can raise the following objections: 

To start with your question no. 3 which I consider less difficult than the others: According to Kant, the only correct motivation to act morally is the respect for the moral law in the form of the categorical imperative. Any motivation different from rational understanding the categorical imperative is considered external and not ethical. In particular, Kant rejects any religious motivation as unethical, see Critic of Pure Reason, B849: 

I propose the following working definition: A phenomenon is physical if it can be investigated by the physical method. The latter is a synthesis of 

The first Western philosopher who discusses explicitly the concept of knowledge - in the sense of valid knowledge from your question - is Plato. His term for knowledge is episteme. Plato contrasts knowledge to mere meaning which is termed doxa. Plato discusses the subject in his dialogue Theaitetos (145e ff.). After several unsuccessfull attempts the dialogue partner proposes the definition (201d): 

The German language does not have the word "Grundsein". It is one of the typical neologism from Heideggers private language. But nobody before and even after Heidegger uses this term. Unfortunately, Heidegger does not define the term. The quoted passage from Time and Being seems cryptic itself and cannot serve as a definition. The literal translation of "Grundsein ("Grund" = "basis" and "Sein" = being) is "being-the-basis". But I do not understand what Heidegger means with the phrase above. Added. When reading Philip's answer I wonder whether Heidegger wants to say: One cannot define a term simply by negating properties (via negationis or neti - neti) I did not register that antique Greek uses more composed words than German. Sometimes language from poetry creates new and fancy composed words. Note. Could you please name one of the typical "agglutinated" Sanskrit phrases; thanks. 

The passage which starts at Plato: Phaedo 97c1 uses the Greek word nous. In general, nous means "mind, sense, intelligence". Here it means mind. It is the usual term used to denote the human mind. But as John and Ram emphasize in their answer, in this passage Anaxagoras uses mind figuratively with the meaning cosmic mind. Later in 98c4, Socrates in his ironic allusion to Anaxagoras uses the term mind with the meaning human mind. Note. Due to John's and Ram's answer I corrected my original reply. 

Russell differentiates in the whole chapter between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. Near the end of the chapter Russell emphasizes that knowledge by description must be reducible to knowledge by acquaintance, Your question refers to his two examples of knowledge by description: 

In Germany one has focused on criterion 1 to asses the historical injustice of Third Reich and of the firing order of DDR, the former society. In addition, one has used the present constitution and the present laws concerning the rights of the present citizens. A second set of questions asks to which degree society wants to asses historical injustice without dividing society. To come back to your original question - and interpreting the intended context: Yes, a society can condemn doers of historical injustice while upholding the rights of the doers who are now citizens of the new society. 

1) The unobservable can be verified in case of mathematics or logic by proof: You have a set of axioms and you derive a proposition by a logical syllogism from the axioms. But in case you do not accept the axioms, e.g.; 2-valued logic, the proof ahs no value for you. The restriction is that the axioms of formal sciences like logic and mathematics are posed neither proved nor derived from any previous truth. 2) In natural sciences one cannot prove general theories. But one can check wether the predictions of the theory conform to the observation. In that case the observation confirms the theory, but it does not prove it. On the opposite, if the observations mostly contradict the predictions the observations refute the theory. 3) Propositions from metaphysics, e.g., nothing happens without a sufficient reason or conservation of the substance, can neither be proved nor compared by experiment with observation. Neither the concepts of metaphysics have precise definitions, nor do the argumentations convince all metaphysicians. 

What makes up “our culture”? I assume you mean the Western culture, as prominent in Europe, in USA and in Canada. Besides philosophy I consider fundamental components of this culture • Education in school and university • Arts • Science • Techology • Politics • Economics • Jurisprudence • Religion. Kants essay “What is Enlightenment?” from 1784 sets the program of enlightenment. This essay is often read in school to encourage pupils to develop their maturity. But alike to others subjects one can question the validity of the old proverb “Non scholae, sed vitae discimus” also here. I went to school in the 60ties in Germany. I did not hear about other works of Kant, not even about the Critique of Pure Reason or about the Categorical Imperative. In these days, philosophy was not a subject in school. Hence I doubt whether many non-philosophers in the West associate with Kant more than the key words “enlightenment” and “Categorical Imperative”. I agree with Philip’s answer that Kant gave a clear definition of his concept of human dignity. But Kant was neither the only one nor the first one who published about this theme, e.g. see antique Roman philosophers or European philosophers of law in the 17th century. Kant has nearly no influence on science. His understanding of Newtonian physics as based on synthetical a priori statements is outdated. In addition, I do not know about any Kantian influence on later technology. Kant had a certain influence on the philosophy of religion, because he gave a clear argument against the ontological “proof”. But Kant’s consideration on the field of philosophy of religion are not the subject of the present post. Kant’s influence on religious belief or practice in the Western world is negligible in comparison to e.g., Martin Luther. Kant’s philosophy of aesthetics is nearly unknown outside the academic world. In my opinion, Kant has nothing to say to artists or performers. I do not consider Kant an artistically gifted person. Kant has a certain influence on politics with his essay “Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Scetch” from 1795. This essay is sometimes referred to in papers on the theory of the state. So far my answer to your first question: Kant has a tremendous impact on philosophical thinking up until now. But outside philosophy his influence on Western culture is limited in comparison to contemporaries like Goethe, Schiller, the composers of Wiener Klassik and also in comparison with later political thinkers like Marx or Popper. Concerning your second question: In a literal sense there is nothing to explain to a layman, because Kant did not have a deep influence on Western culture. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend to the layman to read the original text of Kant's essay on enlightenment. And to ask himself: Today, which steps should I take on my way to further enlightenment?
