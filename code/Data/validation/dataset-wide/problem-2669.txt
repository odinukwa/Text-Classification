Philosophers seem to use more neologisms than most other academics. Novel permutations of morphemes seem especially prevalent. I suspect most people apprehend the meanings of words like mathematizability, cousinhood or cousindom, and intelligentness. One can use words like that instead of using lengthier phrases like the quality of being able to be restated mathematically, the quality of being a cousin, and the quality of being intelligent. None of those are words, but they seem useful. Does increased brevity, generally, justify the use of neologisms like the aforementioned? 

I recently read about encoding and exemplifying. From what I understand - Detective Smith (a real person) exemplifies detectiveness, but Sherlock Homes does not. Sherlock Homes isn't real - and if, upon first learning of the character, I was told 'Sherlock Homes is a detective' - that information (that he's a detective) wouldn't tell me much about detectives - it wouldn't 'exemplify' detectives very well. However, if someone first told me everything about Sherlock Homes, but did not tell me that he is a detective - and then revealed to me that he was. When I learned that Sherlock Homes is a detective, now knowing everything about him (especially, now that I know about his work routine) - I'd have to say I have an exemplification of a detective. So, why do fictional characters not exemplify properties? 

Very, very simplified Gödel showed how you can express the statement S "there is no proof for the statement S" in arithmetic, and either S is true, then you have a true statement without proof, or S is false, then you have a false statement with a proof. Incompleteness or contradiction. You get the exact same result in any system where you can express the same statement S in the system. Now you can reasonably argue that systems where you can express S are stronger and those where you cannot express S are weaker, and it follows that stronger systems are incomplete or contradictory, while weaker systems may be both complete and without contradictions. 

Mary's argument is of course totally wrong. A lie is roughly speaking knowingly telling the untruth to deceive; making misleading but true statements may also be classified as lying. But Mary doesn't give any evidence whatsoever that John knowingly says an untruth, and therefore no evidence whatsoever that John is a liar. Sure, it is a possibility, but Mary doesn't even give an argument. It seems that Mary doesn't know the meaning of "outright lie". Bob's argument isn't very strong though. There is no need for any indications that people might get shorter. All that is needed is John misreading something, or misremembering something, to make his statement not a lie. John might have read one number in feet and inches, and another number in centimetres, and might have gotten the conversion wrong. That would be a silly mistake, but he wouldn't be a liar. After your edit: Doesn't matter whether Mary is right or wrong. When discussing fallacies, we check whether logical reasoning is correct. Mary didn't give any reasoning whatsoever that supports her conclusion. 

A social construction manifests into multiple forms of construction. Social means pertaining to society; a society is multiple people that voluntarily bind each other to a contract or are believed to born into a social construct; this contract lays down multiple structures of living that unify the group. The structures built are: racial, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious. These structures are legal structures that appear to essentialize the human in these social groups to a rigid role; if one defies these laws that one must to adhere to to be a legal racial identity, or ethnic identity, then ostracism occurs; punitivity is seen as the correcting devise to keep one following the law of one's imposed identity. The construction aspect is a legal idea; it supposedly coheres individuals as one identity so nothing foreign can dismantle the group. It's as if individuals disappear, a mass just appears. Interestingly, social construction may be seen a product of biological determinism; the social identity is a fixed and innate identity one is born with; it's as if biology, chemistry, physics constructs these social groups; religion believes these identities are God given, morality believes these identity allow for mutual and fluid activity amongst each other without friction. This is the conservative position. Social construction is seen as a fluid, individual, purely as an experiential identity. It's as if these identities are not actually objective identifies from the 'real'; these identities stem from the ideal; the ideal changes due to experiences not biological mechanisms such as cells, hearts and lungs. This gives forth a plurality of interpretations of what one identity means not just having different identities. The individual is free to derive their identity from personal experience relative to others within group, but also relative to other social groups; intersectional identities can be formed where different social groups interact to form new experiences that enhance unity not break apart unity. Social construction is an extremely relative definition depending on whatever school of thought one adheres to. Objectivists will see sociy construction differently from the subjectivist, etc. Is social construction a social construction; depends on who you ask. It could be a synthesis of all perspectives. 

It was unsuccessful because nobody invested enough time and thought to develop things to a point where they could produce useful results. And why did nobody do that? Maybe it was because everybody who took a close look came to the conclusion that it is a dead end (or that success is very unlikely). You came up with the very very first step: Assign a value 0 < x < 1. Now what's the second step? How would you for example connect the statements "X is a man" (not sure about that), "X is married" (not sure about that either) and "X has a wife" (which doesn't follow completely from the first statements, which would surely make this a suitable situation for many-followed logic), but using rules that don't require you to examine the statements, but only their truth values? 

Well, it wasn't the last of its species, so your question is hypothetical. I'd also be wondering whether you think there would be a difference between a child, an adult, or a drunk adult, and why. If it was the last of its species, the problem wouldn't be a decision between the life of a rare animal and the life of a human. The problem would be whether safeguards are in place to keep the rare animal safe - including safe from kids falling into the animals area leading to a shooting. Apart from that, if you are the guy with a gun who has the choice of killing the animal or putting a human at severe risk, you can't ask questions on philosophy sites. You don't have the time. You have to make a decision in very short time, and you make a decision. In that case, making no decision is also making a decision. PS. I'd bet the zookeepers did make a decision. They didn't ask for advice on the internet, they didn't ask their management, they looked at the possible choices and decided what was the best. 

Among humans? Or among mating organisms in general? Also, in what circumstances? Economically Suppose a couple who value what most people value, and who value those things about as much as most people value them. If they share fixed costs (shelter, utilities, and furnishings), then the arrangement will effect more value for each of them; presuming, living with another person doesn't offset the added value. Otherwise, parasitism better characterizes the arrangement than symbiosis does. Reproductively Whether we ought to regard cohabitating as symbiotic, or regard it as parasitic, depends on the circumstances: Can either party force the other to mate with it? How would doing so affect either party's absolute reproductive success (the number of organisms at an arbitrary future time that will have descended from the ancestor in question)? Game theory explicates this intertesselation well. The game proceeds as follows. First note the following game parameters. 

The second formulation: Always treat everyone as an end in themselves, never just as a means to an end.  

Background I enrolled in a class, The Philosophy of Human Rights. The authors of the course readings never use 'duty' and 'obligation' interchangeably, so I suspect that the terms may have distinct meanings. Question Do the terms 'duty' and 'obligation' represent different concepts to philosophers? If so, what do the terms mean? My attempt to answer the question I thought that a duty might be an obligation that entails action, and that an obligation is a more general term that may or may not entail action. However, one author, Henry Shue, mentions a 'negative duty', such as a duty to respect a person's right to liberty: In essence, a duty to do nothing to someone. I don't consider actions to include 'doing nothing' (that's 'inaction'), so I don't believe that my definition of 'duty', as 'an obligation that entails action', is correct. What's the difference between 'duty' and 'obligation'? Thank you. 

Physicalism asks the question what the mind is made up of; what is the substance of the mind? philosophy tries to figure out what the mind looks like, if it's an actual physical object; is the mind visible? can technology detect the object we call the mind? can one Measure it? it appears that materialism was a bit vague, so the philosophers and scientists, believing in a hard materialist position, wanted to get empirical evidence of this thing called the mind. Functionalism asked the questioned how the mind, whether physical or non-physical, not necessarily visible or not, acted. the mind has beliefs, desires, or the mind is beliefs or desires. functionalism tried to analyze the mind this way. what if physicalism and functionalism theory of mind are legitimate in philosophy of Mind? Rather than trying to erase both studies, physicalism can elaborate the multiple views of the substance of mind to aid neuroscience into finding out what the mind looks like, functionalism can aid psychologists better understand how the mind functions; they can use functionalism to learn about peoples beliefs, desires, etc.
