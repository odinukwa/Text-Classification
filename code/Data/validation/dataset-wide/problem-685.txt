Not really a bicycle question and it should get closed but I would do skate board. Way quicker to change compared to skates and less volume. The longer the board the better it roles but harder it is pack. Go with the biggest board would you want to pack. A good skate shop will be able to tell you a good street board. It is not going to be quicker until you get good on the board. 

Yes you have the wrong part. Count the number of cogs in the cassette / freewheel. Get a chain for that number of speeds. Probably a 9 speed. 

You probably have the right drop out width. Unless it has down tube shifters you have cable routing. The chain size must match (e.g. cassette number of gears) and chain ring width. Your existing chain rings are probably too wide. But I think you would be better off finding a newer used bike with the stuff you want. If you stay with the same number of gears and get different gearing (number of teeth) you can get better climbing. 

Fork is where you get the most bang for the buck with carbon as it absorbs some of the road bumps from the handle bars. I also holds the road a little better. 

Road bike will bang / jump - what ever you want to call it MartynRoadBikes2 Frames and wheels are just as strong Road Bike Party 2 - The Making Of Martyn Ashton's Colnago C59 Disc On tires you lose the flotation and traction of a bigger tire. And a smaller tires is more susceptible to pinch flats. You have to be careful with a 25mm tire but as you can see in the video they push it pretty hard. But for commute I would recommend a cyclocross and and put touring tires on it. 

It is a force the bike is designed for Consider this below. Force 1 and 3 are the axles and they carry your weight. Bending the ends of the top tube mimic force 2. Is that force 2 equal to your weight - no. But it is a force the top tube is designed to handle. This is a force from the axle in a different direction that resulted in a bend failure of the top tube. The top tube must be designed to take some very strong bending forces. Think about if you want to bend the top tube. You could apply bending on both ends or you could stack it on two blocks and stand in the middle. At the molecular level it is resolved shear stress. I have stood on all my bikes - steel, aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber. Jump bikes but you see you see riders come down hard on the top tube. Racers sitting on the top tube Seat on top tube 

You just need to match the size. Bontrager is just a tire that Trek used for that bike. The size will be on the tire The bike comes with a 700x35c The 700 is the rim size - you have to get a tire that size The 35 is the width of tire - you have some variance there For your bike might as well just stay with a 700x35c For a tube you will get a range like 700 x (32 - 45) 

The soap and the sealant do not have the same purpose. The purpose of the soapy solution is to lubricate so the tire better pops (seats) onto the bead. For some tires it is hard to get them on the bead (especially with a hand pump). From there the sealant in the tires is used to seal. Stans has some good videos StansHelpCenter tireinflatingtips 

If you are getting that much rust then you are putting that bike up wet. It does not take much water - it is only dry if it is bone dry. If you are hosing that bike down after every ride you are putting too much water on that bike. Unprotected rust will consume iron and steel. Wiki Rust I would suggest you go with two levels of cleaning 

I seriously doubt you are losing muscle mass. The body only consumes muscle mass in extreme situations. There is also a layer of fat under muscles so loss of fat may look like loss of muscle mass. Many people train much harder than that. No need to for special diet. Add some healthy calories if you feel like you are losing too much fat. 

Cassettes are harder to measure. For example they adjust spacing for IG (Interactive Glide). Chain is something you can easily measure. And it is the cheapest and easiest component of the drive train to replace. A stretched chain will increase the wear on cassette and chain ring. 

Consider what the bike was designed to do and adjust for FIT more than performance. The bike is clearly designed to move the two spacers but I would not do more than that. If that does not feel good (fit) then don't do it. If you are looking for speed performance then consider a second road bike with drop bars. The bike you have now is designed for agility and comfort. 

Regarding "could cause damage to my knees/body if I continue to do this without losing weight or increasing power". For a given grade and a given gear (34f 30r) increasing power will not reduce the stress on your knee. To go faster (higher cadence - more power) in gear X and hill Y you need to push harder. The only thing that is going to reduce pedal force is less weight or a lower gear. Same answer as Eric (+1+). 34f 30r is a fairly low gear. Your muscles may be out of shape but your knee is not out of shape. If you don't have knee problems you should be OK. Unless you are carrying a lot of extra weight. I would go ahead and continue to train with 34f 30r and if you get knee pain then you are going to need to go with a smaller gear or a smaller hill. 

Someone has to say live dangerously. I would ride it. Don't ride it hard but you should not ride a Dahon hard in the first place. I looked at how the bike folds and unfolds and that is not a high strength connection in the first place. Bikes don't typically explode when they fail. You get a bend and sometimes you don't even crash. If it does die if you don't need a folder you can find decent used bikes for $400. 

If you have a triple then a double would be narrower. But as Batman pointed out you may have chain line issues. You also need to consider clearance with the crankarm and the chainstay. Narrow crankarms will buy a little. Clearly another bike is going to be more expensive but a mtn frame is going to limit how much Q factor you can gain. Article on Q factor 

I don't get your logic. So you would share with the rightful owner? Borrowing is stealing. When is property abandoned is a legal question. I am not an attorney and don't take this a legal advice but to me a unlocked bike in public or semi public place for more than 30 days is abandoned. I seriously doubt you can just air it up and ride it. On an economical level if you have to put new tires on it you are not getting a good return. The rightful owner or a person with even less ethics than you will take it. Look for a used cheap bike. But then you don't know if you are buying a stolen bik 

Why does Nitrogen have better PVT characteristics? In the operating range of a tire oxygen and nitrogen have the same PVT characteristics. They are both ideal gasses. Ideal in that they don't liquefy and have neither attractive nor repulsive forces. They are neutral. A bicycle does not generate enough friction to change the temperature much. Bicycle will be pretty close to ambient temperature. If you start a ride in the AM you may get a 10 Celsius swing by 2 PM. Relative to the ideal gas law, PV = NRT, oxygen and nitrogen have the same behavior. T is absolute in that equation. 0 Celsius is 272 Kelvin (absolute). 10 to 20 Celsius is a difference of 4% in pressure. So if the tire started at 100 PSI the pressure when to 104 PSI. Water is the PVT problem. Water is not an ideal gas. In the operating range of a tire H₂0 can exist as a gas and a liquid. From the liquid state to gas state the volume change is over 100 (this is how you can inflate a tire with a little CO₂ cartridge). In the range of 10 Celsius versus 20 Celsius the vapor pressure of H₂0 nearly doubles at atmospheric pressure. Vapour pressure of water Over that same 10 Celsius swing what is the pressure change of water. The vapor pressure of water doubles. Where the ideal gas (N₂) changes 4% water changes 100%. In that same range the water pressure goes up 1 PSI. So the total PSI is 105. At only 1% composition water contribute 25% of the pressure change. The statement from Moz that Nitrogen changes pressure with temperature slightly less than water does is not correct. The difference is 40X but at only 1% that 40X is still not much of a total contribution. So a 1% pressure difference in 10 centigrade. Racers will go after grams. 1% may matter to them. It is not clear if racers users nitrogen (in tires). I see sellers stating it is used by races but I don't see and races saying they use nitrogen. Nitrogen is used in altitude tents to reduce the O₂ content. This stimulates the production of red blood cells. So racers may use tires as an excuse for nitrogen tanks. From 0 to 100 Celsius the vapor pressure of H₂0 goes from 611 to 101417 Pa. In that operating range H₂0 is over 100 times more sensitive to temperature than nitrogen or oxygen relative to pressure. So for a race car the change is noticeable. Why CO₂ in those portable canisters and not nitrogen? CO₂ compresses to liquid state at a lower pressure then nitrogen. The boiling point of CO₂ is -56 Celsius. Can use CO₂ to inflate a tire and not risk it going back to a liquid state in the operating range of a tire. 

The answer is yes they are the same. The proof is Galilean invariance. Put 30,0 and 5,25 into this calculator. Both sets of numbers give same relative velocity (30) and the same WATTS. FLO Cycling - How Velocity Affects Drag 

2 miles each way in 15 minutes is 8 mph which you should be able to achieve. I would say lower gearing but a mountain bike should have some very low gears. Are you in the lowest gear before you have to walk? If it has knobby tires then street tires will be more efficient. Get like 35 mm. General maintenance like tire air pressure and lube the chain. Check your bike fit. How your body fits to the bike. On the incline get in a low gear early. Don't let your cadence get to low as you want to spin up the hill. Check your form. You can get out of the saddle when it gets to hard. Keep riding and it should get easier week by week. 

Wobble Wobble is just plain bothersome. I had one so bad I could not even ride no hands. It is not going to fix itself. The wobble creates forces that make the wobble bigger. Clearly wobble uses energy. I don't need to quantify it to know I don't want it. 

I have not just had them bend I have had them fracture. I took my saddle to the shop thinking they would say "wow how did that happen" and the response I got was it happens all the time - that saddle is a few years old. Aluminum will fatigue - low end seats have a limited life. A steel or titanium seat does not suffer from fatigue (will not at nearly the level of aluminum). Carbon also is reported not to fatigue but I don't have any experience with carbon railed saddles. Inspect your rails on a regular basis for deformation or cracks. If you go out the back and land your bumm on the wheel because the rail fractured it gets a lot easier to spend $100 on a saddle. I think the seat position was also a factor as I had the seat all the way back. What that does is create a longer lever from the back of seat to where the rail is clamped. I also put an offset seat post on the bike so I got what I consider a better clamp position. 

No so sure you had a sudden loss of air. If the tire when from 90 psi to 20 psi in a short period of most likely you would have heard that. Since the valved is the only mechanical device I going with valve failed and recovered. Either random or by force of the cobble stone the valve unseated and before it lost all air it re-seated. I am definitely ruling out rubber tube failed and recovered. If this has happened to you before on that tube then I would replace the valve or tube and valve. If this has happened to you on more than one tube/valve then wow - it has never happened to me. I agree with the comment a patch could fail and then recover at a lower pressure but if you were able to air it back up and hold I would rule that out. My mountain bike was down to 20 psi once and tube only at low pressure could not find a leak but with tire on at 50 psi it did leak (at a patch). See picture below. The little gasket may have deformed or it has a little slit that is held together with compression. Another possibility is the the valve itself (not the knob) is not screwed all the way in. Where you see the flat spot on the the threads screw that in with pliers. I had a set of tubes that by unscrewing the pump some times the valve would unscrew so I would use a dab of thread lock. I think that is actually a picture of a presta valve that the core does not remove - so screwing that in would do no good.
