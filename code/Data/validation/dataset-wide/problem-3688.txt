Running backwards. Have you seen people running marathons and they need to run it backwards halfway because of too much pain in knees? This is because of overdoing forward motion. Ortopedists and physiotherapists often find such customers and interestingly this is related to strength exercises for skiing: when people overdo going forward, they forget the other motion that is going backwards. Skiing requires balance between backwards and forwards particularly in lower legs. Going only forward can compromise your balance so integrating both directions to training is healthy way to improve the strength for skiing because the strength must be balanced. One of the easiest way to work the "ankles and muscles foot to knee" is to go backward: backward running works the muscles such as calves, shins and front thighs. Going backwards also improves the balance in lower legs. More benefits. Then combine this with things such as Backward skating, Backward slalom skinng like here and have some fun. You need to find balance in many levels such as muscular level, neural level and coordination. It is a bit like frontstroke and backstroke in swimming. More balance workouts. 

Vo2max training result into transparent urea, not sure why perhaps not enough eating things and getting/absorbing minerals -- apparently particularly Zinc. I have Leukonychia (white spots in nails). It is caused either by the lack of minerals or body not absorbing things enough aka Hypoalbuminemia. I take this multivitamin here containing: Magnesium 100mg (27%), Kalium 200mg (10%), Zinc 10mg (100%), Iron 14mg (100%), Copper 1mg (100%), Mangan 2mg (100%), Iodine 150µg (100%), Chromium 40µg (100%) and Selen 55 µg (100%). I feel so much better on the morning when I take minerals, it wakes me up (not D-vitamin doing this). This means that my body is lacking minerals apparently or they are not absorbed or my intensity of training requires even more minerals. You can see that I am trying to take 100% RDA/RDI of all necessary vitamins/minerals. It looks that I need more. How to treat Leukonychia with an athletic person? 

I find tight longus colli vertical and sore platysma on my right side. I have tried to strenghten them by holding my head towards my hand forward/sideways but inefficient. The way I get them activated apparently is stretching my head back behind me that sounds unsafe. How can you strengthen the muscles here that require stretching head backwards? 

This is to some extent discussed on pages 959-960 in Exercise-induced hypersensitivity syndromes in recreationaland competitive athletes: a PRACTALL consensus report (what the general practitioner should know about sports and allergy). Why increasing prevalence? 

I want to develop the sensitivity of my hands/arms particularly for tennis. I feel this is essential to get more controlled spins. 

This is my second week of vo2max training where each week has 2 rest days. I train the whole body during the week. I need to eat a lot. If I am not eating enough, catabolism wakes me up. I already took 2 times more vitamins: 

I got an answer in the facebook group of Aalto Fitness (sport organisation in Aalto University). An answerer recommended the the video in Finnish after point 17.00 here (Finnish) and other answer pointed out the problem "Venytystä liikkeessä vastustavat hauis, etuolkapää ja rintalihas" (trans. "stretching movement is blocked by bicep, front shoulder muscle and breast muscle". Movements in English 

I have such specific hobbies that I list here tailored training for each muscle group, many of them are hardly known within practioners. I am working on this and trying to find proper anatomic names to each muscle(s). Also I use wrist supports (you can find in MMA shops) when my wrist may get irritated, this has helped me to train my arms and fingers and not injuring wrists! Sports 

This publication claims increasing prevalence of allergies in elite athletes and "[o]ver 80% of allergic [elite] athletes are poly-sensitized". Yet this is not just an issue of elite athletes, exercise-induced (EI) allergic symptoms can also occur in recretional atheletes. Why does there exist increasing prevalence of allergies and poly-sensitivity in athletes? How do recretional atheletes compare to elite atheletes? 

airway dehydration (risk for EI-asthma and EI-rhinitis), increasing exposure to pollutants in air (risk for EI-asthma and EI-rhinitis), exercising too early after food (such as wheat and shrimp IgE sensitivity causing anaphylaxis) and urticaria with unusual temperature change such as elevated temperature in endurance atheletes. The last can be associated with things such as whear, blisters and anaphylaxis. 

I got blister just to the point that holds a foil i.e. index finger. It irritates me in tennis, fencing and climbing. What are best methods to recover from scar tissue due to blister?

I list here movements from Yoga, I am new to Yoga so there may be more movements to improve the flexibility. So far I have found: 

You sit on top of heels. You try to get back to the floor straight while bending backwards. A picture is here. The ideal position has the lumbar spine almost touching the floor, specifically the vertebrae such as L4-T7 closer to ground. Anatomically, this is related to muscle chains connecting psoas, hip flexors, back muscles and tight hamstrings. How can you improve the sitting on heels position with backwards bend? 

EI-urticaria and associated anaphylaxis There are many different types of urticaria such as immunoglobulin-dependent urticaria (mostly IgE), physical urticaria (cold urticaria, solar urticaria) and complement-mediated urticaria (such as heat-urticaria, serum sickness). Other possible pathogenetic mechanisms are in Table 3.2 of the book Urticaria by Beate M. Czarnetzki, 2012. There are many meditators to urticaria such as histamine, probably the most researhed so far. Histamine leaves marks of urticaria on the skin with the following ways: initial red mucula, then surrounding erythema and edema last (skin ballooning, filled with fuild). This is commonly associated with burning pain and itching. More in 2.3.1 of the book. "Histamine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier" (2.3.1 Section in the book). According to animal tests, injections of histamine into the ventricle can cause symptoms such as increased blood pressure, hypothermia, prolactin secrecation and increased adrenocorticotrophin by the book. Histamine has high concentration in particularly hypothalasmus. Neurons have H1 and H2 receptors and histamine acts as neurontransmitter. Serotonin is other mediator besides the histamine. There are differences such as vasocontriction but also similarities such as that both serotonin and histamine can be increased with estrogen. Both serotonin and histamine can be considered as inflammatory mediators: 

where I think I get more angle than the girl here. What can cause the angle in sumo squat? Is it due to poor hips flexibility and/or groins flexibility? 

Environemntal factors such as pollution could be a factor for the increase. Elite atheletism has developed over years to distributions having flatter tails: only minority get the rewards and can maintain their career and health. Technological development such as IgE microship inference testing Better knowledge such as improved classification of urticaria with different classifiers such as tryptophan 

where the running style has high cadency like in gliding running style and long stride like in gazello running style. This technique is extremely tiresome. For more typical gazello running and gliding running see the comparison here between triathlonists. The legspan requirements are more demanding in the gazello running style. Running comparison to galloping Galloping is favored by four-limb animals for fast movements while two-limb animals such as people do not favour them "gallop metabolically more expensive and involves high muscular stress at the hips" (Biomechanics of human bipedal gallop: asymmetry dictates leg functions) with people. The transition from running to galloping requires about 6 months after learning running. The galloping has opposite motions between legs and arms similarly to running. A difference is that the ground times for strides are longer in galloping than running. The asymmetry of galloping means that it requires more stability from the core than running with people. The galloping of child can be seen on the page 143 of the book with opposing arm and leg motions. In comparison, the galloping is similar with horses where the arms act as supports so less stress to waist than with people. This is the "first asymmetrical locomotor pattern a child learns" (p.142). Summary and motivational areas Interesting areas for further research contain the assesssment of biomechanics on different running styles. At the time of writing, the author does not know whether different legspan characteristics have been analysed for running. A simple asssessment methods contain ruler methods and muscle mass analysis.
