This is a very interesting topic. Like what zero-divisor said you can develop stamina by training just any muscle group going for a high number of repetitions. Yes, push-ups can do the same work running will do for your legs. But however you need to ask yourself whether you want to do sprints or jogging. I will give you an example. 7 years ago I was obsessed by the idea of reaching 100 push-ups in 60 seconds(I doubt the legitimacy of my form now though). So I did, actually I got carried away and at one point reached 200 push-ups in one set. That's stamina, that's endurance. I could go on with push-ups for a while but did not have a good overall strength which I later realised when I started benching. Nowadays I am only interested into strength training. I recently started recording a push-ups tutorial for my youtube channel and figured I would get tired at around 15-20 slow and controlled push-ups. Then I would have to take a break before doing another set. This does not bother me for I have no interest into endurance in my upper body at this point. But I am bringing it up for you to consider. Perhaps the perfect combination for you might be a little bit of endurance and a little bit of strength to balance everything? 

First of all why do you focus only on the plank to maximize the holding time? You can work other exercises that are going to help you with your plank. your whole body is involved in the plank - shoulders, back, legs, abs. Figure out which part of the body dies first and try to strengthen it. Of course this is not a matter of strength as it is more a matter of endurance. You need to perform this exercise often in order for your body to get used to it. The muscles will adapt and start keeping the position for longer periods of time. Your suggestions to train for it sound good only that I don't understand why you would only hold it for as long as a good form of the exercise is present. After you start getting tired your muscles can no longer maintain a good form but they still keep pushing. Thus I believe you should aim to hold it for as long as you can rather than just until a good form is present. Why? In order to get the muscles used to holding for longer amounts of time. Your endurance strength will progressively increase. The longer you hold, the better. Thus the 10 sec hold vs 10 sec rest doesn't seem very promising to me. 

Find a bar that is tall enough so when you hang off of it your feet won't touch the ground. Assure that your whole body is straight as your hanging below the bar. Extend your legs, flex them and keep them and your feet together. I don't advise you to cross your feet, that will create a habit of executing the pull-ups in an ugly manner. Now try a CONTROLLED pull-up where you don't generate any additional momentum and where you have the whole movement under control. What I mean by "under control" is the ability to stop yourself at any point during the pull-up without swinging additionally. 

Gymnasts start working on flexibility first thing in their career. Since the age of 4-5-6, the earlier they start working flexibility the better. After that coaches make them maintain their flexibility level. The older you get, the less flexible you will be. It goes away just like strength(hence why gymnasts start developing that first). It's all about genes. I have learnt from gymnastics coaches that flexibility is not something anybody can develop well. You either have the potential for it or you don't. Just how some kids can go down into a split without ever working on it. I on the other hand couldn't do it both when I was little and later in my teenage years even after spending hours on flexibility every day I made somewhat of an average progress. Thus if you were given flexible joints at birth even if you are older now it should not be much of a problem. 

No danger for the muscles, joints or ligaments really. If you are used to walking and spend several hours taking a walk outside with a friend will that be bad for your body? Doing a lot of push-ups will just develop endurance, if that's what you want then go for it. Last time I checked the world record for non-stop push-ups was 10,507 and was set by Minoru Yoshida. Now that would be abusing it a little bit too much but still if you have progressed slowly to that point your body would be able to adequately handle it. 

Keep your whole body straight during the pull-up and this way you will gain the most out of the exercise. In addition I will say that it's normal for your legs to go slightly in front of you as you are pulling yourself up in order for your body to balance itself. So don't worry about that. Nowadays when I do pull-ups I just keep my legs straight, I straddle them slightly because that helps me to balance it if I am going faster or doing clapping pull-ups, etc etc. 

High five for working out at home! You can achieve the superb fitness level with home exercise if you know what you are doing. Anyhow I remember doing pull-ups with a backpack once too. However the backpack would disbalance me since it was not tightly wrapped around my body. That's why it's much better to weighted pull yourself with a belt. The belt will distribute the attached weight's position better. Also after I passed 20kgs on the weighted pull-ups my backpack started tearing apart slowly. Another reason why I prefer a belt to a backpack is that the backpack rests on your upper body which is working during the pull-ups. Thus if the backpack gets heavier you will find out that it prevents your shoulders and back to flex properly to their full potential during the pull-ups. I know belts for weighted pull-ups can be expensive but you can avoid that with a karate belt that costs around $1-2. Also I have tested my karate belt in weighted chin-ups with 65kgs attached to me. I have written an article about using a karate belt as a substitute to expensive weight belts. 

These are direct exercises for developing this strength as I call them in my tutorials. Developing additional strength will be much easier if you use some assisting exercises as well. The top part of the pull-up specifically engages the top part of your lateral muscles. Working them will help you increase the strength needed for your goal. Working them in a specific manner which resembles the pull-up motion will do miracles for you. Attach rubberbands above you to the point where they end hanging just above the top part of your head. Now focus on the ending motion of the pull-up. Grab the rubberbands in a pronated(pull-up) grip. Pull them for 12 reps, 3 sets. Do this after you are done with your pull-ups being your first/direct exercise. Also, if you are experiencing elbow tendonitis, wait until it's gone before you start with this program. I had the most severe elbow tendonitis and had to go from one doctor to another doctor for a whole year before it got better. All because I did not rest when I had to. If you have any questions fire away at me! 

This is a very interesting topic that I have been discussing recently. It appears that genetically the skin of some people is not flexible and once they lose weight it remains stretched out. I remember when I lost 7kgs when cutting I didn't get any loose weight. But I have seen it with other people where their skin would remain stretched and loose after they would lose some fat(just how you are describing it). However what such people told me is that the skin won't go back regardless of the exercises. So the only option for them was to fill it in with muscles. This way it wouldn't stay loose. For that I can suggest you more than enough exercises but you will have to combine them with proper nutrition plan in order to gain muscle. Right now if you are dieting to lose fat you can't really gain muscle. Let me know if my answer is what you are looking for, then I can suggest how to proceed further. 

I have been working out with rubber bands for 3 years now(after 7 with weights). You should always pay attention to the distribution of the length so that it is equal indeed. Otherwise it will(how you suggested) work both sides unevenly. There isn't much of a science behind that. A mirror in front of you will make things a lot easier but you can do it without one too. Grab the band(s) and step in the middle. If you feel the band is longer on one of the sides just make a step in that direction and even the distance. P.S. Just a side hint - rubberbands will never replace weights. They work your body differently and if you are aiming to gain muscle it will be very hard. If you are aiming for that but don't want to use weights then you should consider throwing body weight exercising in your workouts as well. 

I remember one year when I had to stop working out for 9 months due to inflammations. During these months I would mainly visit doctors and treat my arms but would not workout AT ALL. I stayed active though, I would go out almost everyday to hang out with friends going for a walk. Surprisingly for the first 6 months, considering I was consuming just the same amount of calories as before my injury, I managed to retain my weight and size(size not muscle)! My strength was gone and my muscles were not as lean but with a shirt on there wasn't a big difference. Perhaps that is the case with your father and grandfather. Then past the 6 month I started getting frustrated about my injuries and all the stress made me lose 10 pounds within a week or two. Anyhow I was once told that the atrophy starts after day 3 of your last workout for a particular muscle group. Then during the years I have noticed that this is fairly true. I am a Meso-Ecto bodytype and once I stop working a particular muscle group it starts fading away slowly both in size and strength. Which I suppose I maintained before with a high calorie intake. My guess is that your father and grandfather kept their athletic frames(that never goes away fully) and during the years have replaced some of the muscle with fat. However due to the frame underneath it still makes them look more muscly than fat. That's a guess of course, I don't know what they look like but I have never seen anybody to keep his muscle mass after he has stopped working out especially with a sedentary lifestyle. Image of Arnold Schwarzenegger just pops up in my mind when I say this. 

I have the exact same injury in my lower back. I am just unsure if the discs are the same. Anyhow when younger I had to sleep on a very bad bed which started causing me back pains. Later I started deadlifting and that expanded the pains to protrusions. Doctors told me that everything began with the bad mattress. So number 1 thing for you is to make sure the mattress you are sleeping on is good for your back. The harder the mattress, the better for your back. Also when you sit down on a chair it's good to have something against your lower back so that it is resting. That's what doctors told me and that has worked for me ever since. However they also told me to stop all back exercising otherwise it will lead to disc herniation. I did not do anything for 2 weeks to see how that's going to go and also I wanted to think things through. The pain in my lower back would not go away. I figured that the muscles of my lower back would just atrophy if I don't work them out. That's bad since your muscles support the bone structure of your body. Hence I started working out again keeping several things in mind. 1) Any more serious pressure on your spine might lead things to herniation. That's why I replaced weights with rubberbands. I will give you an example why. Imagine biceps curling. I would curl with barbell of 50kgs. My set would be around 40seconds-1minute. During this minute the barbell would remain in my hands and for the whole minute my spine would have to cope with 50 additional kgs. And biceps are one of the smallest muscle groups in the body. I would use much heavier weights on other exercises. When using rubberbands, however, every time I go down, when curling, the bands will release the pressure on my spine. So if I am to go for 10 reps, at the end of every repetition my spine will be completely relieved from any pressure. If interested check bodylastics, I have been using them for around 3 years now and am highly satisfied: $URL$ 2) Even with rubberbands however the pressure on my spine would still be a lot. That's why I replaced the position of the bands. For example instead of doing biceps curling having the bands below my feet and pulling them up, towards my shoulders, I would attach the bands above my head and pull them down behind my head. This way the bands' resistance is pulling my body up instead of pulling it down, putting pressure on the spine. 3) Bands and weights are different. I can't maintain enough strength just by using bands. That's why I focused more on body weight exercises, such as back lever and front lever(Disclaimer: both articles are written by me). These really, really strengthened my lower back and increased the size of my back. 4) Sometimes I would feel a discomfort in my lower back, typically at the end of a harder workout. The feeling is as if somebody has pressed me against the floor. So I would just feel my lower back heavier somehow. That's when I would throw some spinal extensions. There are two exercises one of the best gymnastics' coaches in my country taught me. Focus on the first exercise, I have linked you directly to it. Some of my friends have similar back problems and would refer to this exercise frequently to release the pressure from their spine. Here's the link: $URL$ (Disclaimer: This video is mine) Also never forget to warm your back before a workout. Be careful with the warming up though, anything more aggressive might provoke a hernia. I hope this helped you, if you have any questions please let me know. 

Nobody can tell you what is "better" when answering your question. They are different and will provide you with different results. I have been weightlifting for 7 years and did calisthenics for around 5. I did them separately as that would mean that nowadays I only do body weight exercising. I would say I got more definition in my muscles but lost size, volume. At the same time gaining size and volume. Same goes for strength. What I mean by this is that before I stopped weight lifting I could biceps curl with 27.5kg dumbbells per arm for 6 reps. Last year when I checked I could biceps curl with 22.5kgs only. However I gained strength on gymnastics rings. When I was biceps curling so much I couldn't do much on the rings and now I can do a gymnastics cross. So I gained some strength and lost some strength in the biceps. The cross is a complex exercise that involves the whole upperbody but I am mentioning the biceps only since that is the muscle group that I made a comparison about. Now about the volume in the muscles. I will refer to my arms again. After I stopped doing weight my arms got smaller. However my biceps on their own got a lot bigger, all the biceps curling never managed to expand my biceps as much as they did expand just after one year of continuous ring workouts. They also got a lot leaner. Then last year just after one workout of biceps curling in a weight lifting gym I noticed my biceps gained more size(got thicker) but lost definition, got bulkier looking. Of course that was not too obvious for it was just one workout but I am used to noticing changes in my body after so many years. Thus I chose body weight training for I find it more entertaining and I like the results better(looks and strength gained). It doesn't mean it's better or worse compared to weight lifting. Nor is it going to prevent any injuries, the risk is equal with both activities.
