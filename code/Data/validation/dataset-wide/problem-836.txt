Quoting $URL$ "When a transit of Venus occurs, a second one often follows eight years later. This is because the orbital periods of Venus (224.701 days) and Earth (365.256 days) are in an 8 year (2922 days) resonance with each other. In other words, in the time it takes Earth to orbit the Sun eight times, Venus completes almost exactly thirteen revolutions about the Sun. As a result, Venus and Earth line up in the same positions with respect to the Sun. Actually, the two orbital periods are not quite commensurate with each other since Venus arrives at the eight year rendezvous about 2.45 days earlier that Earth. After the third eight-year cycle, Venus arrives too early for a transit to occur." 

According to Mathematica and several other sources, the known information about HIP31978 (also known as "S Monocerotis" and "15 Monocerotis") includes: 

This is based purely on Stellarium's simulation, so may not be accurate. From Europa, full Jupiter has a magnitude of almost -17 and an angular diameter of 12 degrees: 

This is wrong, but may help someone find the right answer: You can convert right ascension and declination to a 3 dimensional unit vector in the J2000.0 ICRF reference frame using the standard formula for converting spherical coordinates to rectangular coordinates and using a radius of 1: The ra and dec of the north ecliptic pole is ra,dec of per Wikipedia, so the unit vector representing the north ecliptic pole is: As it turns out, there is conflicting data for Ceres, perhaps because of the semi-recent DAWN flyby. Instead, I'll use Vesta, where wikipedia explicitly states ($URL$ Converting to degrees, Vesta's north pole's ra,dec is . Using the formula above to find the unit vector, we get: If we take the dot product of two vectors and divide by the product of their lengths, we get the cosine of the angle between them. In this case, both vectors have length 1, and the dot product is whose arc-cosine is right around 27 degrees. So, if Vesta's orbit were the same plane as Earth's orbit, the axial tilt would be 27 degrees. However, since Vesta's orbit is inclined 7.14043 degrees to the ecliptic, this answer is incorrect. I don't think you can find the correct answer without using Vesta's inclination and the longitude of its ascending node. Both of these values are known, but I can't figure out how to use them to get the correct asnwer. 

$URL$ but I'm pretty sure this is red herring, since the paper doesn't appear to be in Chinese, and I'm not sure Chinese transliteration even existed at the time. However, it would fit in nicely. 

This doesn't really answer your question, since I'm not sure 13 km/s is the minimal required speed. I also made several simplifying assumptions (perhaps too many), so the answer above isn't exact. Here's the heavily commented Mathematica script I wrote, which also explains the simplifications I made. 

Note also that Venus appears circle-like (not point-like) when it transits the Sun, but the same is true of Mercury, so this may be a special situation that doesn't count. 

Of course, resolving a double star as two separate points of light isn't the same as seeing something as a circle, but provides a good upper limit. 

You've probably long since moved on, but, just for reference, the initial conditions HORIZONS uses are mentioned ("header.431_572") in ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/Linux/README.txt but the only place I could find them in "table form" is in my own git repository: $URL$ The values are explained in $URL$ starting on page 39, "VI. Initial Conditions and Constants", especially in the tables starting with Table 4 on page 47 and ending with Table 13 on page 74. I've written scripts to setup the initial conditions and numerically solve the differential equations using Mathematica, so the following may be helpful: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ When I reduce the step size sufficiently (Mathematica's default step size is too large), my results closely match those of HORIZONS: $URL$ 

We can confirm the Sun's RA matches local sideral time within 1 second of 00:00UTC from these lines in the output: 

While I can't answer the 9 degrees part, $URL$ notes, the band of the zodiac actually passes through 22 constellations: 

When you get your results, click "Save All Intervals" to save the times of Mercury's perihelions. Note that each result is an interval, but the interval is 0 seconds long, so it's actually a point in time: Now click on "Calculation Menu" to get back to the main menu: 

The image above (Sun depicted at 3 times actual diameter) shows the orbit of Mercury with the Sun as the center. This agrees with two other images that are also meant to show Mercury's orbit to scale: 

To answer your first question, you will rarely or never see a total eclipse at the center of the Earth because the moon's shadow isn't long enough. You would, however, see partial annular eclipses. If you do see a partial annular eclipse at the center of the Earth, there will definitely be one (not necessarily total) somewhere on the surface of the Earth. The opposite, however, is not true. It's quite possible for locations on Earth to see a solar eclipse, but the shadow not to pass through the Earth's center, so a center-of-Earth (geocentric) observer wouldn't see even an annular or partial eclipse. Standard debugging tip: try with an eclipse closer to today to see if it's the code, inaccuracy of Skyfield, or just that the umbra didn't hit the Earth's center. 

This doesn't really answer your question, but may help you get started. If you run $URL$ and follow the instructions at $URL$ you can create a video similar to $URL$ but higher quality (youtube lowers the quality of uploaded videos). With the default settings, it's a ~6 hour Mach 1 flight from Menton, France to Rampart House, YT Canada starting at 2017-02-10 at 00:00:00 GMT at approximately 120x regular speed. The only vaguely interesting things about the default flight: 

If you accept the quarter moon (magnitude -10.0) provides sufficient reading light, two of Jupiter's other moons (Io and Ganymede; Callisto is very dark and has a low albedo) can do this as well: 

I think I understand the question, but don't really have an answer. Mu Virgo, the southernmore of Virgo's two feet, has an ecliptic latitude of 9.678 degrees, meaning it's quite far north of the ecliptic. The moon never ventures more than about 5.15 degrees from the ecliptic, so it will never be north of Mu Virgo, or even really that close. The closest interpretation I can give: in some months, the moon's northernmost ecliptic latitude will occur near Mu Virgo, putting it "close" to Virgo's feet. If you run $URL$ with these settings: 

EDIT: Ignore below, see comments for correction. @DavidHammen, I ran your script with start and stop year both set to 2096, and got this: ('December solstice in', 2096, 'is at', 2096/12/20 20:45:17, 'UTC') 

This makes it about 56 times brighter and 24 times larger (in diameter, not area-- it's about 600 times larger in area) than our full moon (magnitude -12.3), more than good enough for reading. It's still not as bright as the Sun on Europa, which clocks in at a magnitude of -23.06: 

NASA keeps track of the exact length of the day (successive transits of the mean Sun) and the difference between UT1 and UTC here: $URL$ For example, these lines: 

This doesn't answer your question, but has two screenshots, so that's something :) If you run $URL$ with these settings: 

I realize down-to-the-second computations of sun/moon rise/set are probably impossible, in part because refraction depends on more than just local conditions, but I'm curious to try. 

As you point out, the mean moon conjucts (and actually eclipses) the mean Sun every M = 29.5305891203704 days. If the moon's sydonic period were exactly 29 days, the gain would be clearly 1440/29 or 49.6552 minutes. If the moon's sydonic period were exactly 30 days, the gain would be clearly 1440/30 or 48 minutes. Thus, your calculation seems to be correct here. 

Given ra, dec, lat, lon in radians, and d in number of fractional days since '1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC', the azimuth of a star is: $-\cot ^{-1}(\tan (\text{dec}) \cos (\text{lat}) \sec (\text{d1}+\text{lon}-\text{ra})+\sin (\text{lat}) \tan (\text{d1}+\text{lon}-\text{ra}))$ and the elevation is: $\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin (\text{dec}) \sin (\text{lat})-\cos (\text{dec}) \cos (\text{lat}) \sin (\text{d1}+\text{lon}-\text{ra})}{\sqrt{(\cos (\text{dec}) \sin (\text{lat}) \sin (\text{d1}+\text{lon}-\text{ra})+\sin (\text{dec}) \cos (\text{lat}))^2+\cos ^2(\text{dec}) \cos ^2(\text{d1}+\text{lon}-\text{ra})}}\right)$ where d1 is: $\frac{\pi (401095163740318 d+11366224765515)}{200000000000000}$ (you will need to resolve the ambiguity in the arc(co)tangent, but this isn't difficult). These formulas aren't as daunting as they seem, since, for you, lat, lon, ra, and dec will be fixed, and the only thing that changes is d. Hope this helps, but I'm worried that it just demonstrates how complicated these formulas are. 

As the page you reference notes, the moon's northern and southernmost declination this month are +-19.4 degrees, about 4 degrees less than the tilt of the ecliptic. Thus, the moon changes declination slower than the ecliptic, at least for this month. 

To be fair, even after applying some corrections, I couldn't quite get 59 degrees or even anything about 58.5 degrees, but I'm sure this is what they're talking about. TODO: I invite someone to create a graph showing how the "59 degrees" varies with latitude. 

Note that the sun rises at 2352 on September 20th, and doesn't set for the rest of the year, verifying the sunrise start time. Verifying the end time is a little tricker. To do this, visit $URL$ with the following parameters: 

My original question was going to be: could this device have worked? I would also appreciate any other information on this product (including a better scan, ideally of the product itself, if anyone still has one). For reference, here is the page on which the ad appears and the cover of the catalog in which I found it: 

As @zephyr notes, the fastest way out of our galaxy would be "straight up" (perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy), not away from the center, since the Milky Way's "height" is much smaller than its length/width. If someone wants to replicate what I did on Stellarium and use RA/DEC grids, be sure to set the date to 1999 Dec 31 at noon GMT: the grids Stellarium displays are based on the current date, not J2000. NOTE: $URL$ lists even more stars than Stellarium (Stellarium uses only part of this catalog), so you might be able to find an even closer star to this point, but I was too lazy to do so. EDIT: Newer versions of Stellarium let you overlay galactic coordinates. I'm too lazy to do this myself, but if someone else wants to, it would be a better answer. 

TODO: I was hoping to add some graphs/visualizations to this answer but couldn't quite get things working. 

[NOTE: The animated GIFs are too large to copy into this post, but the URLs should work] EDIT: all 3 animated GIFs are now available on youtube: 

West of this line, the 21st is the shortest day; east of this line, the 22nd is the shortest. South of 22N, we cross the Tropic of Cancer, and neither day would be the shortest. North of 67N, we enter the land of 24-hour sunlessness, where there are multiple days with zero sunlight. ADDENDUM: Per @JeffY's observation, the shortest/longest day will occur on the same day worldwide (roughly speaking) when the solstice occurs at noon GMT. Here are the times this century when the solstice occurs within 1 hour of noon GMT: 

Planetarium programs like Stellarium let you view the sky from different planets, including the Sun. As above, the Sun's "north pole" is in Draco, very close to NGC 6552 (note it's declination puts it about 2.5 minutes away from the Sun's north pole). Although Stellarium is fairly accurate, this answer shouldn't be regarded as canonical. REMINDER: Do not observe directly from the surface of the Sun. You will be burnt to a crisp ;) 

2, 3, 4. I think this calculation is incorrect because you're confusing sidereal days with solar days, and your attempt to correct for this is in the wrong direction: 

Well, if "last night" means around 2015-04-22 at 2230 GMT, the order from left to right is: Europa, Io, Ganymede, Callisto. Here is a stellarium snapshot of (roughly) this configuration. The snapshot doesn't label the moons, but I clicked on each individually to confirm the order above. 

Your confusion may stem from the way we sometimes draw the Sun (not to scale) as though it's close to the Earth. In reality, as you note, the lines of vision to the Sun are nearly parallel: Note that the angles (measured from the red line, the horizon, to the arrow) are still different, but for entirely different reasons. I've actually stolen @Andy's answer (and @Tanenthor's comment), but I'm hoping the diagram makes it easier to understand. Re the parallel lines, the 11810x60 image below may help explain: even though the lines eventually converge (on an object about 10 times the distance to the moon, still nowhere near the distance to the Sun), they are nearly parallel when leaving Earth.
