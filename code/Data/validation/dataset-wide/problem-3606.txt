"Down and Back" This is a common cue meant to tell the lifter to keep their shoulders locked into position so that the shoulder girdle remains open throughout the lift (to avoid impinging any tissues). An easy way to feel this while standing or sitting is to raise your arms so that both your upper and lower (forearm) arm are parallel to the ground. Now pull your elbows back until you feel your upper back pinch together. While keeping this position, rotate and pull your elbows down. You should feel a small stretch in your traps when you do this. This is the position you want your shoulder blades to remain in while pressing the barbell. I'd recommend practicing holding this position with the empty bar until you're confident that you can hold it with larger weights. 

My intent was to run a version of 5/3/1 over the school year, as it allows for consistency and not having to worry about how much I need to lift each training session. However, my engineering design class is requiring a butt-ton more time outside of class than I could have predicted which has already impacted my ability to train (I've already pulled 4-5 all-nighters, two of which were consecutive). As it is, my study / course work schedule is inconsistent in both frequency and duration. In other words, I am unable to predict when I will have the actual time to train for my goals, and how much time I'll have for each individual session. The only constraint I have to fulfill is averaging going to the gym 3 times per week to get my health insurance reimbursement. On top of that, I work part-time 2-3 days Friday through Sunday. In the interim, I've settled on the following 'program' (see below). The overall question is: is this enough? Sorry in advanced for the length. Original goals: 

When it comes to powerlifting, a large portion of lifters will use a low bar squat which places the bar lower on the back to sit on a muscular shelf made by the rear deltoids. This also allows the lifter to have more forward torso lean throughout the squat and shifts some of the tension to the posterior chain. This together tends to allow a lifter to lift more weight maximally. However, low bar squatting is not a requirement for powerlifting; high bar squats (with the bar on the traps) is also perfectly valid. For powerlifting, which ever allows the lifter to lift more weight during competition is the better variation for them. For hypertrophy, high bar squats might be more effective to a degree as it places more demands on the quads than low bar squats. This doesn't mean that low bar squats are bad for hypertrophy either. It really comes down to which is more comfortable to use and the particular rep scheme you're using. 

The major muscle groups in any variation of bench press are the pec major and minor, and the triceps (with various other muscles playing stabilizing roles). In general, the narrower one's grip, the more the triceps tend to become the primary mover. The close-grip bench press is, indeed, a vary popular accessory for people who have weaker triceps. In contrast, the wider one's grip, the more the pecs will tend to become the primary mover. This can be seen with flyes. The grip is extremely wide which allows the pecs to be the primary source for abducting the arms. A wider grip, though, does come with added risk to the shoulders which should be kept in mind when exploring an extra wide grip. 

This makes sense, as most unilateral exercises can be done at around half of their bilateral counterparts. He also makes a point for when the lunge is below this ratio: 

It seems that you either started too low on StrongLifts, or you are indeed a beginner based on continuing to make progress on the program. You'll only benefit from exhausting your beginner gains in a linear based program like this. You'll be able to go back much stronger for your Olympic lifts. In the meantime, to avoid losing technical proficiency, I'd start warming up each day with some variation of the O-lifts. Even if they are not max effort (probably for the best at this point), you'll be able to focus on maintaining technique so that you don't have to relearn when you get back to your coach. I'd personally do a snatch variation on non-deadlift days, and a clean variation on deadlift days. You could also add in some jerks after doing presses to help keep that technique strong as well. Keep in mind that the variations of the o-lifts don't just include the full and power variations. There are also the hang positions from varying heights, block pulls, etc. Utilizing all of them (not all at once) will help you maintain, or improve, your lifting technique. 

Reps in the range of 12+ tend to be geared more towards muscle endurance than hypertrophy (more muscle mass) or strength. A vast number of training programs with a trainee's 1-rep max (1rm) in mind, this is the most that the trainee can lift one time before failure. 

Frequency Can be used to describe how often a particular movement is performed. If Lifter A squats once per week and Lifter B squats twice per week, then Lifter B squats more frequently than Lifter A. Intensity Used to compare sub-maximal efforts to a person's max effort for a particular exercise. In terms of lifting this tends to be given as a percent of their 1 rep max. The closer they are to their 1 rep max, the more intense the effort will be. Conversely, the further from their 1 rep max, the less intense it will be. Volume Volume is a broad concept as it can be used to analyze a program from multiple levels. At the workout level it will comprise of sets * reps for each exercise (and sometimes multiplied by weight lifted to find the tonnage that was lifted). This allows for a per-workout way to balance antagonistic movements. It can also be used with a larger scope (on a weekly, monthly, or larger scale) to show how a lifter is progressing when the intensity (amount of weight) is not changing. For instance, if a lifter can only bench press 135 lbs for 3x8 one week and then the following week they can bench press 135 lbs for 4x8, then they have progressed through volume rather than intensity. 

Days with the highest priority are the squat, deadlift, and press days. I'm not a powerlifter, so benching is less important for my goals (plus I have a history of shoulder injuries, so less frequent benching isn't horrible [and frankly, I'm just not the biggest fan of it]). Subsequent questions would involve: Should I add anything in particular? Should anything be removed? Is the program organized well enough as is, or can that be improved? Is this type of program better off performed whenever I can fit it in, or when I currently do it, which is first thing in the morning (I wake up at ~5:30 am almost every day, school work permitting)? Edit: I'm still looking for more feedback from a possibly different perspective / or that address the subsequent questions. 

Maybe. Start off slow, and make sure to warm up thoroughly (maybe more than usual) to avoid stretching your hamstrings while cold. While working up to a running pace, pay attention to how you feel. If they hurt (more than just being sore) you're better off stopping or slowing down to a pace that doesn't make them hurt. As an aside, you may also benefit from some active recovery directed at your hamstrings to get more blood flow to them. 

I have a counter-question for you. If running doesn't work for you, but biking does, why suffer trying to run more than you can? I can't claim that cycling will have a lot of carryover into running (it might initially), but it is a very effective way to get aerobic exercise. Like most physical activities, starting too hard, too quickly can be detrimental (as you found out the hard way). Your best option is to move into it slowly if you do actually want to start running. There are many couch to 5k apps and programs floating around the internet that you can use to help get yourself into running for periods of ~30-40 minutes straight. Most of them will involve starting by just walking briskly. Over several weeks, you'll replace a few minutes of brisk walking with short periods of jogging until you gradually build up to jogging for longer periods of time. Progress is progress, as long as you're making it, then it doesn't necessarily matter how long it takes to get to running for longer distances. 

For starters, deadlifts don't count as ab work. Sure they may involve your abs, but they also involve various other muscle groups. You don't do just deadlifts if you want bigger lats for instance. Two common causes for anterior pelvic tilt (that I've seen personally) are either week abs compared to a stronger lower back or weak glutes. I would suggest re-including leg raises, but making sure to raise your legs high enough to move them beyond the range of motion that your hip flexors are capable of (to guarantee ab involvement). RKC planks (planks where you squeeze your abs as hard as possible) are another great exercise for ab strength. I'm also a personal fan of L-sits for as long as possible or in sets of about a minute each. Glute strengthening is a little easier to tackle, as there is more variety and easier to integrate into your current program. Paused ATG squats, or stiff-legged deadlifts or RDL (or even sumo deadlifts), or glute bridges / hip thrusts are all great compound movements that involve the glutes to a large degree. It's often easier to simply start working on your possible weaknesses and reevaluating after a couple weeks or so than trying to guess which one is your weak link and only focusing on that. 

As shown in the image, working in a lower rep range will provide your body with a different stimulus that will promote overall strength gains. That doesn't mean that you have to work in the lower rep range, but progress will be slower if you stick to 15 reps for all of your lifts. This page provides various links that will allow you to explore the effects of the different rep ranges. You can also use the ExRx website to help estimate your 1rm to better plan your routines / overall program. In the end, what you decide to do in terms of increasing the weight for your squats while decreasing the number of reps, is ultimately up to what your goals are. If you're looking for maximal strength then sticking to sets of 3-5 reps might be best, while going for size will benefit from having sets with 8-12 reps. 

Yes ... most of the time While it is true that using a partial range of motion is useful; in that it allows you to use more weight, work around sticking points, strengthen parts of a movement pattern, etc. (ie it's a useful tool in the lifter's toolbox); it should not replace using a full range of motion as the primary method for lifting. Muscle Imbalances can be one of the biggest consequences of partial ranges of motion. For instance, lets take a look at the squat. When performed to at least parallel, the entire leg is hit. However when a partial squat is performed, generally only the quads will be hit, leaving out the hamstrings and glutes. Over time, this sets the lifter up for injury. A full range of motion not only loads the primary muscle groups, but it also places a load on the antagonistic muscles in order to stabilize the load. A partial range of motion may engage these muscles as well, but to a much smaller degree. However, a full range of motion isn't always better. Sometimes a full range of motion causes too much of a stretch in a muscle group (could be a side effect of warming up incorrectly / not at all) which can lead to injury. In the example you gave of dumbbell benching, some people are more likely to experience an injury if they use too full of a range of motion. It is very easy to injury the shoulder girdle, and depending on arm lengths (upper, lower), the dumbbell bench press (and variations) can potentially lead to injury when a full range of motion is used. This can be avoided with a warm up set or two to gauge how much range of motion the lifter can use without experiencing too much of a stretch in the muscle. Ultimately, a full range of motion is superior in that it takes fewer reps to achieve time under tension (since each rep is longer), it properly loads muscle groups and their antagonists, avoids muscle imbalances, and prevents the lifter from using more weight than they can / should use. 

Overall, you have better form than I see in a lot of people starting out, specifically your lower back remaining in a neutral position during the entire lift. Question 1: Your upper back actually isn't round that much, which isn't a bad thing to happen either. Your lats play a role in internal rotation of the shoulder, so as long as they are tight and locked into position, there shouldn't be any harm in continuing the way you are. Internal rotation of the shoulder also isn't a bad thing in certain contexts, such as this, as it provides a position of stability and control. Whereas having internal rotation of the shoulder in a pressing movement can be harmful, as there is less internal space within the shoulder joint itself for tendons and smaller muscles to clear the movement of the humeral head. Question 2: My first idea would be to actually pull from the floor. The mats you're using appear to add about an inch or two of space between the plates and the ground, which correspondingly shortens the overall range of motion. However, the conventional deadlift is a hamstring dominant exercise, so adding 'power' to your quads may be a matter of consciously trying to fire them in the movement. If you are looking for more quad dominance in your deadlift, you can try using the sumo deadlift which places more emphasis on your quads, but also requires substantially more hip mobility to do properly (and tends to require more finesse with resetting the bar between reps). Again, overall, your form is really good for the stage that you're at. One thing that I noticed that you didn't already mention was your bar path. It seems a bit less than straight. You don't appear to be pulling the bar into your legs until after you clear your knees. Pulling the bar into your legs will help keep your lats engaged and upper back tight. Try thinking about bending the bar around your legs as you pull the bar up. This will help you engage your lats (as said before) and allow for a straighter bar path which make the lift more efficient overall.
