Nonetheless, the records show that Churchill and the War Cabinet continued to do their best to divert available resources to provide assistance to India. Shipping remained one of the key problems, and the cabinet recommended that: 

which would correspond with an origin in Southern Siberia. However, the analysis also revealed that: 

People like former South Vietnamese military officers, government workers and other supporters of the former government of South Vietnam were sent to "Re-education Camps" (According to the Wikipedia article, these were called "trại học tập cải tạo" in Vietnamese. As someone who doesn't speak Vietnamese, I'll just have to take their word for it). There were at least 5 levels of these re-education camps, and they continued to operate until at least the mid-1980s. Those considered to be most 'dangerous' by the North Vietnamese were incarcerated in level 4 and level 5 camps. In addition to Wikipedia, there are a quite a few sites that explain the system of re-education camps and describe the conditions within them. An example would be this page from vietnam.info. 

Medieval The medieval period in England runs from the end of the Romano-British period to the beginning of the early-modern period, so from somewhere in the fifth century to the Reformation. Putting exact dates to that period can be difficult, but you will commonly find Honorius's rescript to the Civitates of Britannia, dated to AD 410, as a terminus for the Romano-British period. Establishing an exact date for the start of the Reformation is problematic, as noted above. When I was a student, it was common to choose 1540 as the transition date. However, many archaeologists and historians prefer to opt for the end of the Plantagenet dynasty (at the Battle of Bosworth), which can be firmly dated to 1485, as an end date for the medieval period in England. So "medieval" means AD410 - 1485 (or perhaps AD410 - 1540, or some other, similar date range, depending on definitions and personal tastes). 

Henry Adams' History of the United States of America During the First Administration of Thomas Jefferson explains the developments e.g. in the following excerpt (pp. 80). In short, it seems that Jefferson was "just" being pragmatic in a matter that he deemed important for the nation and for his party. 

The shaking of Hitler's left arm and the fact that he tried to hide it is also mentioned on several occasions in this biography. 

Some villages had histories and thus names going back to Ancient Roman times. A case in point is Matreium in the Austrian Alps, a small village then and now. So the statement that medieval villages didn't have names can hardly be true in an absolute sense. As to whether villages were frequently innominate (as the verbatim quote claims), I'm not sure. As there were yet no national postal systems to speak of, there was perhaps no purpose in uniform naming of a domain's each and every village. But place names must have been in use by individuals: it seems just such an obvious concern for basic human discourse (e.g. "Where are you from?", etc.) 

This was also a direct question in an interview with J. Robert Oppenheimer's biographer Ray Monk, which he chose to answer thus (approx. 16' into the program): 

Large ancient empires, such as the Roman Empire, must have seen similar situations very often. (E.g. the emperor makes decision X in Rome on day J, but it's yet unbeknown to the governor of a remote province when he partially counters it with decision Y on day J + 1). How did the Romans and others deal with these situations? Was it completely ad-hoc or did they also have special applicable rules in their legal codes? (Although I'm referring to an emperor in my specific example and emperors may not have been constrained by legal codes, relevant situations must have also occurred e.g. in private business across the Mediterranean.) UPDATE This week´s Economist carries an article about the economics of interstellar flight which makes for interesting related reading. It cites an early (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) paper by Paul Krugman who even came up with two fundamental theorems of interstellar trade :-) 

Background As you quite rightly said, since the Tarim mummies were "re-discovered" by the Xinjiang Archaeological Institute in 2000, two main theories have developed to explain their origin. The first theory suggested that the earliest settlers in this region were nomadic herders who had migrated from the steppes of Russia, Siberia and Kazakhstan. The other theory suggested that people first travelled to the region from Bactria (roughly, modern Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Unfortunately, the archaeological evidence was inconclusive. The extremely arid conditions resulted in unusually good preservation of organic remains, so we really do have a lot of evidence. In cases like this we usually rely on similarities between the archaeological evidence from different sites to suggest links between ancient peoples. This might include burial practices, the types of animals being farmed, or even (where it survives) clothing. In this case, we have all of the above, but the evidence was inconclusive. Some evidence supported one theory, and other evidence (from the same site) supported the other. Similarly, earlier attempts to determine the genetic origins of the population of the Tarim Basin, based on human remains recovered from the Gumugou cemetery were also inconclusive. The investigations were the subject of a National Geographic program titled China's Mystery Mummies, filmed in 2007. 

The two areas appear to be Olbia and Tyras. They both formed a part of the Roman province of Lower Moesia (or "Moesia Inferior"). It is, perhaps, a little easier to see the detail on this earlier map from the Wikipedia page on the History of the Roman Empire, showing the Roman Empire at its greatest extent under the Emperor Trajan: 

I think what your teacher may have been referring to is not the start of the Korean War in 1950, but the later axe murder incident, a serious border incident in 1976 which involved the deaths of two U.S. soldiers. 

I am reading Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, an excellent source throughout. At one point (on p. 270 in the German edition) the author mentions a turning point in history where Manichaeism, a dualistic religion whose founder lived in the 3rd century AD, could almost have become the Roman Empire's state religion. What specific time or event may he be referring to? 

As for the key sentence ("Hitler had observed ...") Beevor does not point to further sources, so you would have to believe his word as an expert that he certainly is. 

My understanding is that national leadership is de facto (but not de jure) rotating between members of the most influential ethnic groups in the country. National politics are perhaps rightly seen as a mess (a lot of private fortunes are at stake, hence the corruption), but the country has had a long federalist tradition too. Some of the strongest groups are based in peripheral parts of the country (e.g. the Hausa in the North), whereas its oil wealth is concentrated in the Niger delta in the South: so there you have a strong interest against political separation as in Sudan, facts on the ground. There is also the centralizing force of the military (juntas ruled from 1966 to 1979 and 1983 to 1998), plus perhaps new benefits to be had from being Africa's most populous country (with South Africa in relative decline and China looking for new strategic partners in the region). 

The speech was part of a secret session briefing on the situation in North Africa on 10 December 1942. The original papers are held at the UK National Archives under reference PREM3/442/12. That quote was part of a section that read: 

The hieroglyphs used to write that name also had meaning. Foreign names, however, did not have any special meaning. They could just be spelled out letter-by-letter using the hieroglyph that sounded closest to that letter. Thus we have the names foreign rulers, and also of the Macedonian Greek Ptolomeic kings from later inscriptions, like the Rosetta stone. These were rendered into hieroglyphs, and it is often those vowel sounds are then used when we try to pronounce ancient Egyptian names. 

There was a huge migration of population from rural areas to urban areas over that period. A series of Enclosure Acts, passed by Parliament and the Agrarian Revolution meant that many people were effectively driven from rural parishes to urban centres. From 1682, the Toleration Act, allowed (Protestant) dissenters to worship in their own chapels and meeting houses, provided they had been licensed by Justices of the Peace. The effect of this was that many people were baptised by the Church of England, but buried by other denominations. These people wouldn't appear in the CofE parish registers. I noticed that there is a Methodist chapel at Wits End in Eversholt. There are, presumably, other non-conformist places of worship, with associated burial grounds, in the vicinity 

I don't think that Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov ever wrote an autobiography, so we will probably never know his recollection of that conversation. However, the interview with Leslie H. Gelb was published while Ogarkov was still alive (he didn't die until January 1994), and the story was quite widely reported elsewhere. The fact that the story was never challenged by Ogarkov probably means that the sense of the quote at least, if not the exact words, is correct. 

Were tactics specifically aimed against horses common in past cavalry warfare and what forms did they take? For instance, did opponents try to harm (poison or shoot-them-first), distract (loud noises) or detract (opposite-sex horses in battle :) these then all-important animals? Could it be said that breeds of horses were selected for their "mental" as much as physical stamina, and how did people (towards the end of the ages of cavalry warfare, say) train or equip war horses against specific hostile measures. (I do e.g. imagine that in imperial times there must have been huge horse stables even during times of peace, with a lot of surrounding infrastructure including medical, security, etc.) 

The following is from the article on Golo Mann (1909 – 1994) in the German Wikipedia (translation courtesy of Google Translate). Golo Mann was the son of German novelist and 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Thomas Mann (1875 – 1955). 

August Kubizek is another individual with whom Hitler seemed to have sustained some bonds of friendship. I've read about him in Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man, which perhaps is a very good overall source on the topic. 

By 1940 and 1941 a couple of important fireside chats (e.g. explanation of land-lease) by FDR and speeches by Winston Churchill (e.g. give us the tools) probably had made some impact. In any case, by December of 1941 Pearl Harbor was the key event which perhaps would have turned the tide under any circumstances (see also wars following 9/11). 

As a practical matter, keep in mind how writing had to be made historically. The traditional implement for proper writing in China, the ink brush, is actually very hard to use. Even if you know how your name should be written, an average farmer might not have the practiced dexterity necessary to actually draw the character legibly. Thus, for many people drawing such signatures with fingers would have been a logical and obvious improvisation. 

So here John does not disputed Edward named Harold his heir; he simply relays the argument that the promise to William takes priority. Another argument John advanced is semantical: he reasons that word choices in some of the chronicles implies Edward gave Harold the kingdom only temporarily for safe keeping until William arrives. So John does not so much argue against the bequest, as he attempts to rationalise it to fit the pro-William stance. Ultimately, it appears only one historian of note is know to deny outright that Edward's bequest happened: 

Moreover, Russia was allied to France by an accord that was understood, by both sides, to mean that mobilisation guaranteed a war on two fronts for Germany. 

A famous case was that of three term Maryland Representative John Hill, a bitter opponent of the Prohibition who decided to make some wine and cider and reported himself. 

Another view is that modernisation is a relative concept. That is, the idea of Meiji Japan modernising only exists because she was surpassed by the West and wanted to eliminate the gap. In this view, modernity is not about the economy per se, but rather about adopting the necessary institutions to keep up from now on. Black's definition is in this vein, tying modernity to the ability to partake in the scientific revolution:
