The one thing that should be said first is that the Germans had air superiority, but just as with tanks, men and artillery, their air power was not superior in numbers overall. It was just better focused to achieve local superiority where needed. The allies could field roughly 1.500 fighters and bombers combat ready along the border to Germany, while the axis had around 2.500 ready to attack. But in absolute numbers, the allies had about 4.000 and the axis 3.000, that's almost the opposite in terms of air power. As always, the axis was outnumbered in absolute numbers. So it came down to mostly what the whole campaign was planned around and came down to: concentration of force on a specific goal, tactically and strategically. When in a war for more than 6 months, there is really no valid excuse to have more than half your air force stand down and parked behind your lines. But the allies did. I haven't read enough literature on this to say with certainty whether this was due to personal incompetence of the military leadership or just obsolete strategies, but it fits in really well with that mix that basically describes the whole campaign on the french side: "Unprepared for modern warfare, fighting the war of 1918 when it's 1940", still believing that stretching your forces out is good and your "line" being flanked is the worst thing that can happen. 

In the United Kingdom, you could become a life peer. This title could not be inherited, it was limited to the life of the holder. In Germany, this concept was called Persönlicher Adel (personal nobility). 

The swastika, sword and oak leaves seems to be a medal from the WHW, a nazi "charity" (although you might not actually have had a choice whether you wanted to participate). 

As already noted in a comment, it was never illegal in Germany. You could sell and buy any existing copies. Reprinting it was not allowed by the copyright holder (the German federal state of Bavaria inherited it from Hitler after his death). The copyright expired 70 years after Hitler's death and so reprinting it is allowed again. Germany decided that instead of leaving the reprinting business to a lot of private right wing organizations, the "Münchner Institut für Zeitgeschichte" (Munich Institute of History) published a version that contained the original print accompanied by a comment: "Hitler, Mein Kampf: Eine kritische Edition" Except for illegal reprints, anything printed between 1945 and 2015 are probably books that feature excerpts, comments and texts by other authors. But again, the book itself was never "illegal". Existing copies could always be sold, bought and read freely. 

On the eve of the election of March 5th 1933, the NSDAP had called for a "day of the awakening of the nation". My guess would be this is a commemorative medal for participants in the town of Oldenburg, but I could not find anything about it. 

The skull on the lower left is the gorget patch of the Panzertruppen (tank/mechanized forces). While the SS was most famous for their "death's head" divisions, that one looks differently. This is a Panzertruppen symbol. 

The Battle of Britain was a battle to gain control over the airspace over the channel and the English coast. Control of the airspace would have enabled Germany to control the English Channel sea zone because the German Navy was considerably weaker than the British but air superiority would have enabled the German Navy to prevail and cover a crossing of the channel for the army. The Nazis lost the Battle of Britain, never gaining air superiority. As a direct result they never controlled the English Channel and as a direct result of that, never crossed it successfully with any land troops. 

Those pieces do not contradict each other, they may have belonged to the same person. Those worn as part of the Panzertruppen uniform maybe even worn with the same uniform. You can see an example uniform of the Panzertruppen with the golden stars on the epaulets, the skull on the Kragenspiegeln and the eagle right in front of the officers cap. Although it may not show in the photo, the cap's eagle is metal, the uniform's and non-officer cap's eagle is fabric or somehow embroidered: 

Yes. The air force did play a big role in the blitzkrieg/schwerpunkt/combined arms tactics of the Germans. Self-propelled artillery came later on, so much of it was still towed and took long to set up. Air power was a good and sometimes the only way to crack tank formations and bunkers. Looking for a potential turning point of the campaign due to air power of either side, there really was only one big air battle: Sedan 13/14th May. The Germans were about to cross the river with a pontoon bridge at Gaulier and the allies knew that that river was the best defense against the German tanks they had. Once the tanks were over the river, they'd not be able to contain them. So the french generals (correctly) decided to focus all their air power on that bridgehead and more importantly the bridge itself, so no more troops would cross. They called it "la fournaise de Sedan" (I guess that translates to "the furnace of Sedan") meaning a kind of hellish, fiery doom kind of place. However, unlike the Germans, they simply weren't able to focus their power that effectively. Throwing "everything" at it resulted in about 400 planes attacking, less than half of them bombers. The french fighters flew 250 sorties to protect the bombers. That's nothing compared to the 814 sorties German fighters flew to defend those bridges and the 300 AA guns they had amassed at that place. That air battle was a total disaster for the french with not a single bomb hitting the bridges and more than 150 planes lost (shot down, crashed or returned but beyond repair). So yes, even if you don't consider the offensive capabilities, the campaign could easily have been lost of not for the defensive capabilities of the air force and AA regiments. Ensuring that victory is possible and the troops can be effectively deployed (across a natural boundary in this case) and used is a very strong contribution to any war effort. 

This also goes for all those places in that time. I don't think any kid thinks of the boarding school they were brought against their will as a good place. Coupled with the propaganda above and a focus on physical disciplinary action, it sure is hell. But there was no single special place or organization that one could name. Even the Nazi's Elite went to boarding schools, Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt called Napola, even those could be described as horribly abusive and this is where some of the Elite sent their children voluntarily. There have been a few organizations to "deal" with kids in a more drastic way (Example, Example, no need to read if you want to sleep at night), but I don't think your relative was there. There was no coming back from those. What you are looking for was probably called a Kinderheim, Erziehungsheim or Internat, all normal German words in use today. The Nazis simply took the existing organizations and infected them with their ideology. 

You have to think of Hitlers tyranny less as a ideology backed by evil people, but as evil people seeking backing by an ideology that they created and twisted whenever they saw fit. Nazi's first and foremost ideology, as in any tyranny, was self-preservation and personal gain of wealth and power. Of the leader himself, but also of his countless sub-leaders in the hierarchy when it would not run contrary to the overall goals. They used antisemitism as it fit them and they allowed other priorities whenever necessary for their prime directive. Good reasons to deviate from their ideology for personal gain was "allies" (in quotes because to them that meant people able to die in place of their own armies or as part of their armies) or helpers (as in forced labor) or sometimes, as cynical as that may sound, because it was too much of an effort to follow through on it. In this case, Wikipedia gives you a few hints on what the Nazis might have seen in them: Maybe potential "allies": 

This was basically any school in the Third Reich. All of them would (re)educate children with their propaganda. 

The two identical gold-ish pieces are probably signifying rank and belong to an epaulet. Without the actual epaulet, there is no way to tell rank, but assuming two pieces means he wore one on each side, this would most likely make him a first lieutenant or a lieutenant-colonel. 

I don't know of any and I don't think it would be fair to do that with any factor. The decisive element was not a single one, but rather the successful combination of all of them. As in any good team if they work together, they get way stronger than their parts and can overcome opponents that when laid out on a datasheet seem superior in every single category. 

So whatever paper was produced to legalize this, whoever thought about theological theory... he was just a tool for the leadership, to make it possible to work with the Crimean groups that hated the Soviets, too. Hitler did not care about religious theory. At all. Neither did his fanatical followers. 

No While there is no way to prove a negative and the eastern front was so large and vast that individual actions of any kind are imaginable, there has been no known sanctioned murders of German soldiers based on their level of fitness. It would have been been a huge blow to morale of both troops and civilians. And by 1943, basically "morale" was all they had left. Also, T4 never actually targeted physically wounded people. There were enough WWI veterans that they would not dare to try. It targeted people with mental disabilities in mental hospitals. People that could not defend themselves and had little support from the community. So there is no relation at all between T4 and wounded front-line veterans. 

I think that's basically because "reality" would be boring to play. A depiction of reality would be the allies player have double the number of pieces of every kind, but the axis player taking three turns in a row for every allied turn, thereby being able to focus his fewer pieces into a situation where he has superiority at the one situation he picks every round. It would play a little bit like tower defense on the french side. You set up your pieces and your enemy takes turns while you can do nothing but watch and pray that it holds. 

The upper right, shiny helmet is a Stahlhelm membership pin. Stahlhelm was a militant, nationalistic organisation of former veterans, that got assimilated by the SA when Hitler got to power in 1933. 

Below that, the greenish helmet with a swastika reads "Tag der erwachenden Nation, Oldenburg 4.3.33". 

It was the exact facts you mentioned in your question. The catholic church considered Hitler dangerous. He had proven that he would be a ruthless enemy if provoked. And now, by dismantling the German Weimar Republic, he had gained absolute power. He was more dangerous than ever before. An enemy that is known for religious discrimination and death squads surely is an enemy you want to make peace with if you are a religious institution unable to protect your people from his power. So in short, the concordat was a move to protect church parish and property from Hitler's now absolute and unrestrained power. You can certainly argue over the moral dimension of this move. When is it morally justified to save yourself (Catholics) when you know others (Jews) will suffer? That's not an easy question. But that's the turning point you spoke of: the moral high ground of denouncing National Socialism vs the (rightly or wrongly) perceived need for self-preservation. The timing was only logical. You try to save your own hide, when your enemy gets so powerful that you fear for your own safety. And again: a tyrant ruler tearing down the republic and turning it into his own pet dictatorship certainly is a good reason to be afraid.
