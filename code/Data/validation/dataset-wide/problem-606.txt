The problem of drivers passing cyclists too close, while dangerous, is well below the threshold of being a serious road safety concern when considering other causes of death and injury on the road (at least in my country where drunk drivers, speeding and inattention kill 100s of people every year, vs between 0 and 2 cyclist being passed too close). All you will do if you persist in involving the PD is annoy them, they really do have much more important things to deal with... You have no claim in civil courts. What damage have you suffered - the civil courts (rightly) cannot compensate you for something when you did not suffer a loss. You might be able to prove mental hardship, not sure I would want to go down that path..... Criminal investigation and criminal courts - unfortunately in most countries, its that outcome, not the action itself that determines the laws response. If the outcome is a slightly miffed cyclist, usually nothing will happen. If its a dead cyclist, then the full force of law will swing into action and (in my country at least), the driver will slapped in the wrist with a wet sock. In some countries you an bring a private criminal case - the significant sums of money involved that would make it an unreasonable response. You ask 'what reasonable steps" and "educate problem drivers"... The only reasonable response is accept you cannot "educate" everyone and continue to "educate" drivers open to it - or stop riding your bike. 

Take it all off again and check the tyre thoroughly, when this happened to me I thought I'd bought a dodgy Chinese tube, so I got another. The second time I ran my fingers over every inch of the inside while flexing the tyre open and found a tiny bit of wire just barely poking through the tyre into the tube and dug it out. 

I use a 1 meter long thick heavy chain and a big solid padlock, both too thick to be cut with small bolt cutters (lost my keys a couple of times, so I know this for sure). Also great for deterring stray dogs which abound in my country and would-be road ragers which also abound here. This stops any but the most dedicated thieves (never lost a bike). But if you lose your keys you need some serious tools to free your bike. 

I carry a spare tube, a pump, patches and glue. Because if I get a flat tyre I don't want to be stuck pushing the bike. Simple as that. 

I started commuting the same way about 8 months ago on a 29'er mountain bike, 2 things made the trip faster and more enjoyable. Firstly tyres, I changed from knobblies to slicks and it made a BIG difference both in feel and actual speed. Secondly I got a lot stronger from biking every day. I eventually got a lighter cheap touring bike which is faster, and better in many ways, but I still prefer the mountain bike for fun. 

The tube does not contain the pressure. Consider what happens to a tube is you put 8bar into while not mounted inside a wheel+tire...... If the tire cannot contain the pressure, the tube explodes, but it is that lack of conatainment that causes it. Problem is the tire or the rim. This cna be caused by : 

Given it appears that it was fine before going into the LBS and noisy after, the most likely thing is contamination. 

"...feel the big change I had ....." This may be your problem. Well adjusted high end canti's with good rubber, in the dry, are more than capable of out performing many discs. BB7's are very good cable brakes, and will out perform cantis in most conditions, but in ideal conditions the cantis might even be better in shear stopping power. Are you sure your expectations are not too high? Discs excel in less than ideal conditions - rain, mud grim etc, and have lower maintenance requirements. They also give better feel and control than canties so feathering and such like become easier. So if you have followed @DWGKNZ answer, ask someone (your LBS) with expriance in disc brakes what they think - just make sure its not someone used to high end discs on 250mm rotors..... If you need more stopping after all the above, you may be able to change to pads to improve performance. 

First - a lot has changed in 19 years, but not much. Some bikes are lighter, faster (and a lot more expensive) than 20 years ago. The difference between your Hardrock and a new one today is small enough not to matter for most people most of the time. I am with @Blam this - if just wanting to get fit its arguable a heavy slow bike is better - its certainly cheaper than upgrading. If comparing against yourself is the goal, any bike will do. If comparing against others, one thing is more satisfying than passing some random cashed up middle aged exec wannabe on a $10000 super bike on your 20yo Hardrock - seeing their face as you do it. If racing against others and winning is your goal, you need a new bike. If keeping up with a group is a problem to the extend you do not enjoy it, a new bike would be a wise investment. Valid reasons for a new bike is if the Hardrock is a poor fit and/or you are uncomfortable riding it. If the Hardrock is worn out (many 19yo bikes have less miles than many 19day old bikes, so age is not a good guide) it may be better to replace it than spend money fixing it. Another valid reason is if, having put down hard earned money - against your husbands wishes, it makes you feel bad about not using it and motivates you to keep riding where you would have stopped riding had you not upgraded (i.e. it gives you the will power to keep riding). One good reason not to replace it just yet - wait till you have a few more miles under your belt, and have established a pattern of use. At the moment you are getting into it. You may find you like single trail MTB riding, or get into 100km road rides. In a few months you will know how you are using your bike not how you plan to use it. By not changing the bike, you don't have to ask 100 questions (What kind of bike, what brand, how much to spend.....) that have no correct answer. 

I just bought two bikes in Australia and I'm wondering the best way to pack them and ship them to my country. They're sitting at a relatives house right now. I'll probably send by ship due to cost so volume is important. Unfortunately my relative is not great with tools and doesn't know anything about bikes and has never even ridden one, so I'm trying to work out something simple and easy. My idea at the moment is to remove the front wheels and lower and turn the handle bars. Lower the seat as far as it will go, remove the outside facing pedal, and put the bikes side by side facing different ways. Is there a better way? How should I go about protecting the wheels/spokes during the packing? Cost, volume, and ease are my main concerns, these are cheap mountain bikes and my guy isn't mechanically inclined to the extent he'd probably have to borrow a spanner rather than own one. Already shipping will probably cost more than the bikes did. 

I have a touring bike which I use for commuting, I carry about 30 kg of tools with me usually on this pannier type thing I made on the back. And usually a work belt on the front which is 7 kg I'm wondering how much more I can safely carry on the bike without stressing it too much. The tyres seem to be under a lot of strain in particular. I'm 75 kg, unloaded with just me the bike tyres look fine, when loaded they're flattening out to an alarming amount. I just ride on the road, but they're not good roads, I want to add about another 20 kg of tools and I'm wondering if I should put a fatter tyre on the back. I have 29 inch tyres on my mountain bike which look like they might fit. Or whether I'm worrying needlessly? 

Finally, the general idea is to feel like you "float" over the rock garden, get used to the feel of the bike sweeping a couple of inches below you while keeping a good, firm but not stiff grip on the handlebars. If you don't feel comfortable at certain speed, reduce it, and practice. Have patience. Sooner or later your speed will grow and you will master these sections. Also, with practice, your line selection abilities will improve, you will do it faster and find ways of sticking your front wheel in strategic points where it wont slip and those points will serve you to improve control, switch lines or change course. Remember: practice and patience. On a side note: Did you ever as a kid played running and suddenly stiffening your feet so you slid on the floor for a couple of yards? You weren't afraid of such slippage right? Why? You already knew how to predict it, you actually enjoyed it, so relax and enjoy your gardens! 

Some specialized shocks may have more adjustments. In either case, read the shock specific user manual for the model you get. All of the above also applyes to MTB suspension forks, except for the looks and the routine cleaning part. 

Allow my rather anecdotal answer, as for the third point in the question. I used to ride a stock Trek VRX 400, did XC riding along with some jumps and drops. I was 18-22 years and I think my weight was around 120 lb. At that age the bike felt perfect, I loved that bike, I felt the bike very responsive, and each time I wanted to learn some new move, I felt no "resistance" from the bike. Some time later, My VRX broke, so I acquired a Diamondback X2 (this is a 1999 model, I bought the frame in 2007, I think...). For some reason I also inherited another VRX (Trek VRX 200). So now I had two bikes. I used to ride both in the same trials and trying the same stunts. The X2 had very lower end components compared to the VRX yet I liked it much much better, I'll tell you why... By that time I was 24, (I'm 28 at the time of writing) and my average weight had raised to 160 Lb. (Today it's 175). I had a little more strength by then, I used to try to measure it pressing a scale against a wall with my legs... Now, the bike comparison: The VRX is noticeably lighter than the X2. The VRX is a lot more flexible. With just sitting on the bike, and applying a litle force to the right pedal I could see the hole bottom bracket part go to the left, It was evident, I mean, you could literally see the frame twisting. Both bikes had the same crankset sizes, but the VRX had a 11-32 cassette, the one in the X2 was 11-34. The two bikes had some components that where the same, as I used salvaged parts from my broken VRX to assemble the X2. Had the same shifters, same rear derailleur, pedals, and tires. However, the X2 had V-brakes, and lower end hubs and rims. The inherited VRX came with disk brakes, bontrager rims, a bontrager front hub and a DT Swiss rear hub. Both bikes where ridden with WTB Velociraptor front tires @40psi. The VRX had a Velociraptor Rear (specific) tire at 40psi. The X2 started with a generic tire and was later upgraded to a WTB Prowler XT. both @40 psi. The X2 was initially assembled with the Manitou XVert-t2 fork from the broken VRX400 and was later updated with a RockShox Tora 302, While the VRX200 was rode with a Manitou Xvert DC. While riding, the X2 had far better acceleration and climbing. This was not because of the cassette, because I shifted to higher gears in the X2. For example, a hill I climbed using 2-2 (2nd front gear, 2nd rear) in the VRX, has easy for me in 2-4 or even 2-5 with the X2. With the X2 I was even faster than a friend who rides a Trek Y 26 superlite (Carbon), the same guy beated me up if I rode the VRX. I the descents I quickly became more agile with the X2, mainly because of two aspects. The perceived stiffness of the X2 frame made me feel the bike had a faster response to my input, I also got a much better feel of the ground through the bike. For example, with the X2 I was able to tell exactly when a tire was about to skid. I became so confident using the X2, that I started Downhill Racing with it, something I felt very reluctant to do with the VRX. After about a year of riding both bikes, the VRX had turned into my backup bike, used only when the X2 was on the repair bench or once in a while to avoid rust... To summarize, the Stiffness in my X2 made feel much more confidence, and provided me way better "communication" to and from the bike, much faster response and terrain feedback. I could tell exactly where the tires were passing. This developed into much more maneuverability, despite the X2 having a slightly longer wheelbase. The VRX, although had a light feel, is simply inefficient, I was never able to ride the same slopes with the same times. It made me feel tired more quickly, and had a dorky sensation along rocky ascents. In conclusion: the stiffer frame outperformed the other enough to compensate for being heavier, and as a whole bike, it also compensated the lower quality components. 

Note: When adjusting the main thing is to ensure the pad does not run the tire, and is about 2 mm below the top of the rim. 

@Gary Has a valid view on the answer, but its also a bit more complicated than that. He has compared a 250 motorbike to a 1000cc motor bike - completely different to comparing a $500 road bike to a $5000 road bike. A better comparison is a 250 GP Motorbike vs a 250 Sports bike vs a 250 Commuter..... Unlike motorcycling, Road Cycling is the new Golf. As a result, a lot of cashed up middle aged executives have taken up the sport, and the marketing has largely responded to this by targeting them (more importantly, their disposable income) - promoting the 'need' and desire for high end product. Compared to Golf, a $5000 bicycle is cheap, therefore, its not hard to convince them they "Need" one Are they grossly overpriced - they have a lot of RD cost attached, are built out of exotic materials, the shops have a high risk stocking them (End of year sales == 50 percent or bigger discounts), they are relatively low volume products (at the high value end of the scale). Marketing expenses are quite high as it is competitive. There is no doubts the margins on high end bikes is high - just like everything else in this world. Whats different, is many people fell the need to purchase a high end bike due to the excellent marketing, and can actually afford it. Not many of us can afford a Lamborghini or Bugatti, so they do not target us with marketing, and we by a Toyota and are happy with it. The real question is "Is riding an overpriced high end bike more enjoyable/worth wile compared to riding a cheaper mid-range bike". The the answer to that is "It depends" 

I have a very steep hill on my route which levels out after about 2 km. The first quarter is extremely steep and shortly after I enter it the bike skips around a little bit and by the time I'm at the bottom I'm gripping the handle bars and working pretty hard to keep it under control. Is this a normal issue or is it indicative of problems with the bike? It happens both with my mountain bike and the touring bike. Less on the 29'er mountain bike perhaps due to the wider tyres and less twitchy handling. There is a lot of acceleration right from the start going down. Clarification:- I'm not concerned with other people's safety or traffic, my question is more about at what speed does my bike become unhandleable and/or fall to pieces. 

I'm drawing up a plan for a trailer, I've looked at quite a few online and some have larger wheels than others. Does anyone know if a bigger wheel (or smaller) conveys any advantage to handling or anything else? I have spare 26 inch wheels and can get smaller ones. It will be a single wheel trailer. Update clarification, the idea is basically to chop up another bike removing everything except the forks and the bars in the picture and turn it around, then a bar to go over the bikes back tyre and attach under the seat. 

For my daughters bike I took the brakes off a wreck one of my colleagues had hanging in his shed and replaced the crappy ones, cost me a beer. Only concern was if it would all fit on, which it did. So I took the whole assembly, lines levers and brakes.
