Sure. None have been successful though. 1 He who wants to attack a praxeological theorem has to trace it back, step by step, until he reaches a point in which, in the chain of reasoning that resulted in the theorem concerned, a logical error can be unmasked. But if this regressive process of deduction ends at the category of action without having discovered a vicious link in the chain of reasoning, the theorem is fully confirmed. Those positivists who reject such a theorem without having subjected it to this examination are no less foolish than those seventeenth-century astronomers were who refused to look through the telescope that would have shown them that Galileo was right and they were wrong. — Ludwig von Mises, Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.70 2 "The essence of logical positivism is to deny the cognitive value of a priori knowledge by pointing out that all a priori propositions are merely analytic. They do not provide new information, but are merely verbal or tautological, asserting what has already been implied in the definitions and premises. Only experience can lead to synthetic propositions. There is an obvious objection against this doctrine, viz., that this proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions is in itself —as the present writer thinks, false— a synthetic a priori proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience." — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, pg. 5 3 “The attempt to disprove the action-axiom would itself be an action aimed at a goal, requiring means, excluding other courses of action, incurring costs, subjecting the actor to the possibility of achieving or not achieving the desired goal and so leading to a profit or a loss. And the very possession of such knowledge then can never be disputed, and the validity of these concepts can never be falsified by any contingent experience, for disputing or falsifying anything would already have presupposed their very existence. As a matter of fact, a situation in which these categories of action would cease to have a real existence could itself never be observed, for making an observation, too, is an action.” — Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method 

"The whole controversy is, however, meaningless when applied to praxeology. It refers essentially to geometry. Its present state, especially its treatment by logical positivism, has been deeply influenced by the shock that Western philosophy received from the discovery of non-Euclidian geometries. Before Bolyai and Lobachevsky, geometry was, in the eyes of the philosophers, the paragon of perfect science; it was assumed that it provided unshakable certainty forever and for everybody. To proceed also in other branches of knowledge more geometrico was the great ideal of truth-seekers. All traditional epistemological concepts began to totter when the attempts to construct non-Euclidian geometries succeeded. Yet praxeology is not geometry. It is the worst of all superstitions to assume that the epistemological characteristics of one branch of knowledge must necessarily be applicable to any other branch. In dealing with the epistemology of the sciences of human action, one must not take one’s cue from geometry, mechanics, or any other science. The assumptions of Euclid were once considered as self-evidently true. Present-day epistemology looks upon them as freely chosen postulates, the starting point of a hypothetical chain of reasoning. Whatever this may mean, it has no reference at all to the problems of praxeology. The starting point of praxeology is a self-evident truth, the cognition of action, that is, the cognition of the fact that there is such a thing as consciously aiming at ends. There is no use cavilling about these words by referring to philosophical problems that have no bearing upon our problem. The truth of this cognition is as self-evident and as indispensable for the human mind as is the distinction between A and non-A.” — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.5 

According to Professor David Roochnik, in his lectures about The Republic, the choice of Piraeus as the setting for the dialogue is symbolic for two main reasons: 

I don't know of any philosophical work dealing specifically with the application of metaphysical ideas to software domain modeling. At best, to my knowledge, item 1 has been treated by Eric Evans, but with only a slight reference to Metaphysics; and item 2 has been briefly mentioned by Rich Hickey in reference to Whitehead's "Process and Reality". So, I'm looking for other works, that make the connection between these two areas of knowledge and, more importantly, works in pure Metaphysics that would help me get a more insightful perspective on domain modeling. * Of course, there are other concerns related to domain modeling – more technical in nature – that don't concern us here. 

In the beginning of The Republic, when discussing the nature of justice, Socrates leads Polemarchus to agree with him in this line of reasoning (the numbering is mine): 

Whether a certain "being" in the domain should be represented as an entity or as a value. Roughly speaking, an entity is an object that exists by itself, has an identity and a thread of continuity over time. A value contains attributes but has no conceptual identity. This distinction mirrors that between essence and accident, respectively, in Aristotelian jargon. How to represent the passage of time for an entity (see item 1): either as a series of changes of state through which an ephemeral entity undergoes; or as a series of immutable states arranged in a sequence. In the latter case, each of these states keeps existing forever, associated with a point in time in the life of that entity. 

There is a consistent pattern throughout the corpus of Plato's dialogues: first, Socrates proposes a philosophical problem, like "what is justice?" or "is there an immortal soul?". Then he goes on to challenge each attempt of his interlocutors at defining the concept or solving the problem. As the dialogue evolves, the reader is presented with the opportunity of gaining deeper and deeper insights into the problem. But at some point, the dialogue ends, leaving the question unsettled. And then, the style of the text changes and he starts narrating a myth, like the one depicting the fate of human souls after death, at the end of Phaedo. How should we understand these closing myths? Are they the "correct" solution (from Plato's point of view) that could not be attained by the dialectic method? Or are these myths just a different approach to the problem that, although very useful, do not solve the problem, either? 

I really do not see how can you infer (2), (3) and (4) from (1). In fact, I'm not quite convinced that (1) is true, either. Is this a valid piece of reasoning, or is Plato purposefully presenting a non-sequitur? 

It is unnecessary. Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics by Murray N. Rothbard ...Moreover, even if verbal economics could be successfully translated into mathematical symbols and then translated into English so as to explain the conclusions, the process makes no sense and violates the great scientific principle of Occam’s Razor: avoiding unnecessary multiplication of entities… ...Although himself a mathematical economist, the mathematician son of Carl Menger wrote a trenchant critique of the idea that mathematical presentation in economics is necessarily more precise than ordinary language: Consider, for example, the statements (2) To a higher price of a good, there corresponds a lower (or at any rate not a higher) demand. (2') If p denotes the price of, and q the demand for, a good, then q = f(p) and dq/dp = f' (p) ≤ 0 Those who regard the formula (2') as more precise or "more mathematical" than the sentence (2) are under a complete misapprehension … the only difference between (2) and (2') is this: since (2') is limited to functions which are differentiable and whose graphs, therefore, have tangents (which from an economic point of view are not more plausible than curvature), the sentence (2) is more general, but it is by no means less precise: it is of the same mathematical precision as (2'). Mathematics versus Economic Logic by Ludwig von Mises ...The deliberations which result in the formulation of an equation are necessarily of a nonmathematical character. The formulation of the equation is the consummation of our knowledge; it does not directly enlarge our knowledge. […] No such constant relations exist, however, between economic elements. The equations formulated by mathematical economics remain a useless piece of mental gymnastics and would remain so even it they were to express much more than they really do. ...The mathematical method is at a loss to show how, from a state of nonequilibrium, those actions spring up which tend toward the establishment of equilibrium. It is, of course, possible to indicate the mathematical operations required for the transformation of the mathematical description of a definite state of nonequilibrium into the mathematical description of the state of equilibrium. But these mathematical operations by no means describe the market process actuated by the discrepancies in the price structure. The differential equations of mechanics are supposed to describe precisely the motions concerned at any instant of the time traveled through. The economic equations have no reference whatever to conditions as they really are in each instant of the time interval between the state of nonequilibrium and that of equilibrium. Only those entirely blinded by the prepossession that economics must be a pale replica of mechanics will underrate the weight of this objection. A very imperfect and superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by logical economics... 

In order to acquire irrefutable knowledge, Descartes first doubted everything, even the existence of an external world. Then, starting from the "cogito, ergo sum", he started proving the existence of everything he had doubted before. Some time ago, I heard from a philosophy professor that this method is deeply flawed. According to him, leaving aside the correctness of the proofs, the fundamental problem is that Descartes got it backwards, because one can only come up with proofs about anything if that thing is already known with certainty before proving it. A proof, in his view, is just a way of communicating to another human being something they do not know directly. In other words, proofs are useful only to others. To the person advancing the proof, direct, personal evidence should be enough. So, for example, how can one expect to achive undoubtful knowledge about the natural world, if that same world is previously assumed non-existent? Is there any fallacy in this counterargument? 

Piraeus was the place where the Thirty Tyrants were defeated and democracy restored, in 403 BCE. Being the port of Athens, Piraeus was – as any other port city in the world – full of foreigners, some of whom, like Cephalus, were very rich. This would be related to the discussion about whether cultural diversity in a city is a good thing or not. 

In the Theaetetus, one of the theories of knowledge examined by Socrates and Theaetetus is that all knowledge comes from perception. At the same time, they are examining another theory: that everything that exists is never still, immutable, but is constantly changing (becoming). But they do not seem to make any distinction between the two theories. As I could understand, they lump them together, treating the two as the same hypothesis, only expressed in different ways. Or, perhaps, as parts of a single unified theory, which Socrates attributes to Protagoras. To me, however, they look like very different theories, each one dealing with a different problem. I'm wondering what is the connection between them. A possible solution that occurred to me is: since everything can be perceived differently by different people – or even by the same the person at different times – nothing is absolute. Everything depends on the person perceiving it. But not in the relativistic sense that there is no truth. Let's take one of the examples given by Socrates. When a healthy man drinks wine, the wine tastes sweet to him, but when he is ill, it tastes bitter. It's not only the case that he perceives the taste of the wine differently, but the wine itself becomes different at the moment of perception. Is this the correct interpretation? 

As a software developer, I often face the problem of meaningless terms. It is very common in our industry that a certain term is first coined with a very specific and useful meaning. Then, it becomes fashionable to use that term, so everyone starts using it to mean more and more things until, in a couple of years, the term has become so diluted that its original meaning is lost altogether. This has been occurring with the term agile, for example. Which philosophers have addressed this probem of dilution of meaning and how to avoid it? I have illustrated the problem with a software development example, but it may occur in every professional field. When a term has reached that meaningless state, it becomes impossible to have a rational, useful and unambiguous discussion.
