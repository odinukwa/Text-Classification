For example, Followers of Jesus were originally all considered 1) Jews in a cult, then were called 2) 'Christians', which translates to "Little Saviors" or "little Christs" by Greeks and Romans, then Romans separated 3) Jesus-Followers from Jews, calling them Followers of the Way, and finally 4) They incorporate the name "Christian" for themselves. You can see that with other groups as well - 1) Deaf 2) Dumb 3)Hearing Impaired, then they agree on the label 4) "deaf". Something similar happened with people unable to walk (although it took effect over a LONG period of time) 1) Handicapped 2) Lame/Cripple 3) Disabled 4) Impaired. In your story, there should be a similar progression. For example, if you're in a X-men, Inhuman, Chronicle or similar style of world, that can be a minor plot element. Something like a: 1) Biodynamic 2) Mutant 3) Genetically Different 4) Biodyn. 

There will never be a non-working society from top to bottom. Just like the visions of the future from the 1950s showed the office worker of the year 2000 lounging on beach due to the labor-saving devices, that did not come to pass... there will be advances, and certain instances of repetitive physical labor will be largely replaced by machines, many others will not. Anything that requires flexibility or creativity, in design, repair, even something like cleaning houses or weeding, will still be in the hands of people. And even at that point, note that this won't be universal across the planet. Just like there are people living on less than a dollar a day in India and parts of Africa, while what is considered "in poverty" in the US and certain European countries includes thousands of dollars a year, and can include an air-conditioned home and various devices. You will have a population that can live off the work of their father's father, just like the life of luxury that the children of Sam Walton, the Rothschilds, or the Du Pont family live in, but that will still be far from the norm. For example, the person who invents the burger-flipping robot will be wealthier than the burger-flipping robot maintenance technician, who will be wealthier than someone who used to flip burgers. 

His best position would be one dependable and in the shadows, an unaging advisor that has a view much longer than the next financial quarter or next election, someone similar to a advisor. If you have such institution in your story, the immortal would be a great person to raise to the head of a shadowy Illuminati/Spectre-like vast conspiracy, as that would be able to move him around to various other locations if needed. The closest analog would be the unaging and unkillable Jack Harkness from the semi-secret agency Torchwood. He doesn't need to draw a salary (because he's already incredibly rich due to centuries of compound interest), and has been around long enough to know various heads of state, outliving entire dynasties and political parties... but never as a public-facing political leader himself. 

More than likely they would be emitting something more powerful than red light, but the idea is sound. The Hugh Howey novel Beacon 23 is based on this idea. In that novel, it's broadcasting the location of a large asteroid field, as that world's FTL travel is similar to Star Wars (physical objects can impact travel due to gravity fields). As for surface area, enough is largely dependent on how far you want it to be seen by. I could definitely see you wanting to mark something dark, like an asteroid field or black hole (emitting something other than Hawking Radiation), or smaller things like the aforementioned docking bays, although something more similar to Range Lights would be better for those.. Supernovas and similar events are already pretty bright all by their lonesome. 

What I would think would be the most interesting is if you also show the opposite happening with the pirates themselves, because 500 years would also do a number on them. They may go through similar social evolution. It could be interesting if, for example, the colonists militarize waiting for these pirates, but the original pirates go in a spiritual direction and view the generation ship as a promised land of sorts. 

If it isn't likely to impact the story, I would put it in a location that is most advantageous as a plot device at an opportune (or inopportune) time. 

Diamond armor would have to be constructed very differently than traditional mail or plate armor for it to work in the manner intended. As @MozerShmozer pointed out, Diamond has a very small toughness, and viability to cracking, so diamond plate armor is out. Like you stated in the OP, even a single layer of diamond mail would slowly disintegrate over multiple hits, even if scaled like @Thucydides suggested. However, if you created armor with multiple layers of diamond scale, you would have something that is about the same weight as normal armor, with added protection from projectiles due to the diamond scales shattering away . The only issue that would arise is if a foe were to forcefully impact the exact same spot multiple times, which typically doesn't happen in a normal battle, until all the diamond scales in that one spot are gone. Depending on the thickness, a warrior with diamond scale armor could conceivably wear 3 or more layers (or even more layers on specific body locations) that would have the same weight of a typical armor of chain or plate mail. 

Because it's a relatively small group of people, you'll want to have some system to rule out accidental incest. Iceland is currently doing that now, and they have over 300,000 people. You may want to get rid of love as an aspect in marriage and family planning, going back to Victorian-style cultures. Remember, that is a relatively new development... Romeo & Juliet was originally written as a satire of the terrible things that happen if you follow your heart rather than marrying who your family wants you to marry (Spoiler: you're going to die) and only recently (last 80 years) have we started reading it as "look at this tale of love breaking down walls" which was not the original point. If this is reinforced strictly on the first several generations, this system WILL break down over the 600 year period. You'll want to build whatever anti-incest system SEPARATE from the rigid family/marriage structure so that will remain independent and required, while the social norms change over time. 

Option one (going forward, The Prestige method) would be looked down upon in most senses, because current society as a whole tends to dislike mindful killing of people... even if they're terminally ill, or mass murderers, et cetera. I could see them making this option available for people who need to disappear, be officially deceased and become a legally different person (because, technically, they are) or for any other reason that a person needs to be dead. The Prestige method could also be used as a form of punishment, where the body is killed whilst also able to serve out a sentence, simultaneously. I would highly doubt the ability for people to overlook the death aspect and view this as transport. Option two, Telecloning... It depends on the impact of the Telecloning on the cloned counterpart. If you can teleclone anything society would zip to breakdown status very quickly, similar to the story A for Anything or The People Maker. However, if it's more like a Xerox (that is, copies work, but you can't copy a copy), then there's going to be very interesting headspace to work through. Since both individuals are freethinking individuals capable of independent thought, they would most likely be legally two different individuals, with similarity in name, genome & appearance, like identical twins. Because of that, there will be an interesting push and pull from governments on this issue... Pull back, because that makes all data-oriented things insanely difficult; they may also push it on other individuals, as they would be able to be taxed separately. Telecloning still wouldn't be considered much by way of transportation, because "you" aren't actually going anywhere. This is, of course, provided there are no sort of psychic or other supernatural connection between the original. What it would do is increase the value of skilled professions, because the "same" individual could be working in all needed locations simultaneously. All doctors would be the best doctor, because you'd teleclone the best doctor, who opts to it, to all hospitals in a certain network. The best professors, counselors, consultants or other specialists could effectively work the entire field. Existing property laws would have to be changed, as anyone rich enough could not only buy multiple properties, but live in them, simultaneously. On one hand, this would allow any location to potentially jump to a certain industrial or economic level as another one without having to train a local workforce prior to expansion. One massive thing that would have to be the managed, that no one else has mentioned thus far, is gentrification. This would impact the economy very much like the post-recession economics in the US in the 2008-2012 era (younger workers competing for jobs alongside those with decades of experience)... because "the best" is available as an option, that will push down on the employment levels of the rest of the economy. Not forever, because the clones start old and still age, but it will have a definite impact. Also the massive lack of diversity in the tech sector today will be replicated in all other industries as well - cloned CEOs, CFOs, doctors, researchers, designers, sportsball players, spies, et cetera. While telecloning would shorten the initial training/educational time of a new division, overall flexibility and creativity would massively decrease, because everyone using a teleclone would be thinking literally the same. 

It depends on how "realistic" you want to be. For something conceivable right now, probably the best thing would a combination of that Ion Drive for progressive acceleration as well as Hydrogen engines for reactive/dogfighting engines. If your protag is humanoid or humanish, they'll have a bunch of water lying around anyway, and the breakdown of hydrogen for fuel and oxygen for air would be useful. If you'd like to get into slightly speculative, take a look at the Resonant cavity thruster, the which is something that's currently being studied because it breaks some of the laws of physics, but still seems to work. If your scope is a hop skip & jump into the future, you can have them just work on a much larger scale than they do (?) now. Alternative means of long range travel include the previously-mentioned Orion Drive, fusion drives or Solar Sails (that would be in lieu of an ion engine as they too provide progressive acceleration), or an exterior launch source, such as a massive railgun or Mass-Effect-Style Relay devices across the galaxy (launch the ship in a certain direction, then they can maneuver from there to the target). Two hundred years is a surprisingly long time science-wise, so you can touch on other speculative endeavors as well (heck, Star Trek: Enterprise is based in 2151, and that's using a warp-bubble drive). An interesting idea if the target environment was an asteroid field may be a gravity wave type of Propulsion, where the controller could increase and decrease the mass of the vessel on the fly, allowing movement through gravity effects and slingshot maneuvers. There's also the very confusing Mustafa drive, allowing a craft to effectively swim through space
