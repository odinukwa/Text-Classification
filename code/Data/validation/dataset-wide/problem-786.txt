If we could detect the cosmic neutrino background, then I would class those neutrinos as "things" and there should be lots of them! I guess whether they are detected or not, they are extremely likely to be there. These cosmic background neutrinos were produced when the universe was about 1 second old. I agree that most protons are almost a second older! But a tiny fraction of a second older than this would be gravitational waves produced at the end of the inflationary epoch (if we can detect them). 

Well, yes apparently that is how it works and a Nobel prize was won in 1993 by Hulse and Taylor for demonstrating this phenomena in the object PSR B1913+16. PSR B1916+16 is a pulsar (a rapidly rotating neutron star with a strong magnetic field that emits beamed radiation along its magnetic axis). The pulsar provides an extremely precise ticking clock with which to study the motion of stars in a binary system. The pulsar is in orbit with a companion that is also a neutron star (though not an observable pulsar). The orbit is elliptical with a period of 7.75 hours. The period of the orbits is decreasing. That is, the two stars are gradually getting closer together. This effect is a consequence of general relativity, that predicts that such massive objects that are so close to each other will act as a source of gravitational waves. The gravitational waves have not (yet) been directly observed, but GR makes a prediction for how much energy they carry away and hence at what rate the orbital period changes. The rate of decrease in the distance between two bodies is given by $$\frac{dr}{dt} = -\frac{64G^3}{5c^5}\frac{(m_1 m_2)(m_1+m_2)}{r^3}$$ and leads to a merger between the two objects in a time of $$t = \frac{5c^5}{256G^3}\frac{r^4}{(m_1 m_2)(m_1+m_2)}, $$ where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two orbiting bodies, $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ is the speed of light. In slightly more friendly units $$ \frac{dr}{dt} = 7.8\times10^{-19} \frac{(M_1 M_2)(M_1+M_2)}{r^3}\ au/yr,$$ where $r$ is in astronomical units and the masses are in solar masses, and $$ t = 3.2\times10^{17} \frac{R^4}{(M_1 M_2)(M_1+M_2)}\ yr. $$ Thus you can see that the effect gets much stronger (and the merger times shorter) if you have two high mass objects (it depends on the product of the masses) with a small orbital separations. For "normal" stars you can never get them closer than their stellar radii and generally means that the effect is too small to be important. However, compact objects (white dwarfs and neutron stars) can be brought much closer together and this is why the effect has been seen there. The Hulse-Taylor binary components have masses of $\sim 1.4 M_{\odot}$ and are separated by an average of about 2 million km (0.013 au). Inserting this into the formula above give a merger time of 1.7 billion years. A more accurate calculation that takes account of the elliptical orbit gives 300 million years. However, if you made the neutron stars orbit with a separation of 0.1 au (more typical for a normal stellar binary system), the merger timescale would increases to well beyond the current age of the universe. 

Isn't it just conservation of momentum? Without any external forces, the centre of mass of the binary system must stay in the same place. For example, imagine that you had a binary system, where one star had a circular orbit and the other, with equal mass, was eccentric. Clearly, as the orbits proceeded, the centre of mass, which is half way between the stars, would have a position which oscillates with time. But with no external forces applied to the binary system, this is forbidden by the conservation of linear momentum. 

Thus there are lots of ideas to solve this problem, and other ideas which suggest it is not so much a problem, but that we can't do the measurements properly. 

I think there are a number of studies that look at these statistics; I'll try to dig some out. In the meantime I can give you some further things to ponder. First, let's assume a null hypothesis that the statistics and mass distribution of planets were independent of stellar mass - what would we observe? Well one selection bias you don't mention is that the likelihood of transit detection depends on the ratio of planet to star size. This means you are less likely to see small planets around F-stars than M-stars. Or to put it another way, you expect the fraction of large planets to increase with stellar mass - as you have found. It is quite likely that the material available to form planets is correlated with the stellar mass - in other words there is a correlation between stellar mass and protoplanetary disc mass. In which case it could be quite difficult for smaller stars to have the requisite protoplanetary disc density to form giant planets before the disc disperses. 

The spin behaviour of the two types of pulsar would usually be quite different. The $\dot{P}$ for a rotationally powered pulsar is always positive, and higher order time derivatives of $P$ are quite small. This is because the rotational kinetic energy is powering the pulsar emission and the neutron star continually spins down as it loses rotational energy. Accretion powered pulsars can have very variable spin down or spin up characteristics, because they are powered by mass transfer and accretion in binary systems, and are influenced by a variety of factors affecting the accretion flow and how it couples to the pulsar magnetic field. The rates of spin down can be much higher than can be plausibly be accounted for by magnetic spin down as in a rotationally powered pulsar. Spin up cannot be accounted for in a rotationally powered model and neither can sign reversals or dramatic variability in $\dot{P}$. Additionally, an accretion-powered pulsar would necessarily need to be in a short period binary system - therefore there would be a very obvious periodic modulation in the pulse period caused by the doppler shift as it travels in ts orbit. 

So the cartoon that is drawn is an idealised scenario that gets messed with due to the real physical geography of the Earth and its oceans. The tides are also affected by the Sun. However, any asymmetry in the same sense as is shown in the cartoon will result in tidal torques and tidal accelerations in the sense that the Earth's rotation is slowed whilst the Earth-Moon system is tidally accelerating to larger separations and longer orbital period. The "bulge" leads the meridian position of the Moon in your diagram because there is a lag in the response to the tidal force. This is akin to a driven oscillator where the damping leads to a lag in the response with respect to the driving force. And the Earth simply rotates by a certain amount during the lag time. The periodicity of the driving force and response is 12h25m. The actual lag and phase shift will depend on local geography but should be longer than 12 minutes. This source (which I strongly recommend you read) says that in the Southern ocean - which has the "cleanest response" to the tidal driving - the bulge rises about 2-3 hours after the Moon crosses the meridian. I don't understand the rest of your question; the tides are raised by tidal forces due to the Moon (and Sun). 

No, absolutely not. The core of a core-collapse supernova is one of the hottest places in the present-day universe. The temperature as the star runs out of nuclear fuel in its core is around 6-10 billion Kelvin. As it collapses, the core gets even hotter, perhaps as high as 100 billion Kelvin for a few seconds, before neutrino cooling starts to become effective. We know that the temperatures are getting as high as this because at least two neutrino instruments on Earth detected roughly "thermal neutrinos" with energies of $\sim 10$ MeV coinciding with SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (see for instance Mirizzi et al. 2015). 

I think the Earth's orbit is by far the strongest argument you have that the Earth formed around the Sun. The orbit is nearly circular and almost in the Sun's equatorial plane, similar to the other planets. These facts are naturally accounted for if the Earth formed from material that coagulated in the Sun's primordial disc, where circularisation and collapse to a plane perpendicular to the Sun's rotation axis are expected. Capture of planets is possible and is thought to be reasonably common in the early dense environments of star forming clusters. A captured planet would therefore have a similar age and metallicity to one born around the Sun, since star clusters are empirically almost coeval and chemically homogeneous. The problem is that terrestrial, rocky planets take some tens of millions of years to form. Most dense star clusters have dispersed on much shorter timescales than this. Even if the Sun was born in a rare, long-lived cluster, its primordial disk of gas would have already dispersed within ten million years and thus there would be no mechanism to circularise a captured Earth's orbit or enforce an orbit in the same plane as the other planets.
