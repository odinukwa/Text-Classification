Even assuming that $57 billion figure is true, not only is it not bigger than all of the companies combined, it's not even bigger than just one of them. Microsoft's revenue for 2010 was $62.4 billion. 

Is it really up to pilots to decide on flight plan and do they actually receive personal bonus based on amount of fuel saved? 

That's another issue. I don't think this map is reliable, as it shows many countries with FB usage way over 100% (with cases as extreme as 619% in Central African Republic or 505% in Iraq). 

In other words, this confirms that there are quotas, and it's common practice, and this unit only makes news by sheer number of officer who hadn't made quota at same time. 

Some TVs use motion interpolation, in which case they "fake" intermediate frames by interpolating consecutive real frames. This reduces "jumpiness" known as judder. It's more significant at lower frame rates as 24Hz of movies or 25Hz of SDTV. Motion interpolation is completely unrelated to motion blur. 

To some extent yes. Well know technique is cloud seeding to induce rain. It was used during the Vietnam War, operation Popeye was carried out to induce heavy rains over Ho Chi Ming Trail. 

Yes, it's pretty much true if by taxes you mean federal Income Tax. Both in case of 20% paying 80% of taxes, and bottom 40% paying insignificant amount of taxes. Data from 2009: 

BTW. Spanish (and few other languages) are pronounced as they are spelled, but that doesn't work other way around. There are many homophones in Spanish. 

However, seems that in this experiment control group was not exposed to any light at all, thus this really says very little about how bad is LED compared to other sources of artificial light.

What you're referring to is defined as Gini coefficient, which measures how far the income distribution curve is from the utopian "line of equality" (uniform distribution). Value of Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality as in one person would earn all of country's money).

From description sounds like standard activated carbon filter. No mystery there. There are thousands of these on the market. BTW. the standard they are referring to is: 

While claim that life expectancy rose from 1929 to 1933 by 6 years is true, the conclusions are far fetched. The effects of the Great Depression on the people didn't end in 1933. In fact for the people 1933 was the middle of the Great Depression. US unemployment rate has been constantly rising from 1929 until 1933, when it has peaked at 25% (source). So if you'd expect to measure the effect on people, it would be after 1933. And indeed, life expectancy fell by 1½ years 1933 to 1934, and reached local low in 1936 at 6 years less than 1933 (source). It did not recover to 1933 levels until 1938, which happens to be the year when unemployment reached pre-Great Depression levels. A plot of above data (male and female life expediencies): 

Network and Other Communications Equipment 28.8% Mining, Crude-Oil Production 23.8% Pharmaceuticals 15.8% Medical Products and Equipment 15.2% Oil and Gas Equipment, Services 13.7% Commercial Banks 12.6% Railroads 12.4% Entertainment 12.4% Insurance: Life, Health (stock) 10.6% Household and Personal Products 10.2% 

This effect is so well known and documented, that it's actually used as a measure of rainfall's intensity. See "Rainfall estimation using microwave links" or "Identification of Dry and Rainy Periods Using Telecommunication Microwave Links". 

The most infamous case was alleged FBI's backdoor in OpenBSD's IPSEC stack. However, it was never proven beyond doubt, that it actually existed.

In Greenland there are no inland settlements, most of the population lives in the towns on the south-west coast. 

source: WHO report "Exposure to Air Pollution: a Major Public Health Concern" We're not in Fallout universe, there are no nuclear powered cars. On the other hand electric cars do not pollute urban areas regardless what kind of fuel is used to generate electricity. While nuclear power does help reduce carbon footprint and reduce air pollution to some extent, it cannot claim saving 80,000 lives annually. 

Apple Inc. did sue NYC, however it was not about "Big Apple" nickname, but the logo that went along with it — a stylized apple. 

In other words, he does not address the issue of war and violence at all. Nor is it included as the condition preventing a country from economical advance: 

The whole thing is part of Red Bull Stratos project. Highlights video is available on YouTube, there will be the National Geographic documentary "Space Dive" released later on. 

The fame comes not from how much they drink, but from how they drink. So looking at the annual average does not give you real picture, as Russian annual average (15.7L/y) is similar to European average (12.2L/y). However, if you look at the drinking patterns, Russia and Ukraine clearly stand out with the most risky ones.

Graph is accurate, but the conclusion is not. Unless you'd want to argue that radiation causes violence, rather than cancer. As you can see, during the fall of the Soviet Union there is huge increase in male violent deaths. However, cancer (neoplasms) rates remain practically flat. Mortality rates by cause: 

There are two factors determining insolation, weather and latitude. Since insolation of UK is much lower than of other European countries at same latitude, and similar to countries much farther north, only factor responsible for that difference can be bad (cloudy) weather. 

Source: $URL$ Now, the argument is that poor spend more than they earn, while rich make savings, thus the first spend higher percentage of their income on VAT. There are however two flaws with this argument. First, it is typical apples to oranges argument. VAT is sales tax, not income tax, so it makes absolute no sense at all to calculate VAT as percentage of income. Second, as you can clearly see, even if you just look at income (light green on the figure), it's still progressive. Ironically, these facts don't prevent author of the referenced article from arguing, that VAT is regressive. 

Yes it does. VGA or keyboard cable has side effect of acting as antenna. Both eavesdropping and countermeasure techniques are widely knows as TEMPEST (which was codename used by NSA). It's described with details and numerous references here. Example from above source: 

However, Google and Cisco claim these numbers to be inaccurate, and claim to have no PBEs (personal belief exemptions). 

In the graph quoted in the original question, the life expectancy drop is less significant in Belarus and Ukraine, which were more affected, and more significant in Kazakhstan, which wasn't affected at all.

Yes, it's real. It has been extensively covered by Spanish national TV (TVE) and newspapers (mainstream, not tabloids).

It's a popular meme, "in Australia everything tries to kill you", often backed up by the list of dangerous animals, such as box jellyfish, variety of spiders, salt water crocodiles and sharks. However it's purely anecdotal, and one could imagine similar list for example for US. Do statistics actually confirm that Australians are more likely to be hurt or killed by animals, than people in the other regions of the world? Update: As it's not clear how one would measure "more danger". I'd say attacks per capita and fatalities per capita would be good metrics for comparison. 

Smart meters would allow to better predict energy usage peaks. Energy companies have 3 ways of dealing with peak demand: 

It's not possible to easily find out the cost for backbone traffic, because it's done almost exclusively via barter, which in particular case of IP traffic is called peering. Also, typically peering isn't even formalized in any document. Excerpt from the Survey of Characteristics of Internet Carrier Interconnection Agreements (emphasis mine) 

Each of these options means considerable cost to the power company, so if they can do it only when as needed and when needed, they would save significant part of that cost. Smart meters are part of wider idea called smart grid. 

Thus, "natural proportion" for newly hired software developers in US would based on available graduates be 82% male, 18% female. However, if you look at actual occupation statistics: 

Network and Other Communications Equipment 13.9% Medical Products and Equipment 12.1% Oil and Gas Equipment, Services 11.0% Household and Personal Products 10.4% Food Services 10.4% Pharmaceuticals 9.1% Specialty Retailers 8.5% Wholesalers: Diversified 8.4% Petroleum Refining 8.3% Mining, Crude-Oil Production 7.8% 

Water's LD50 toxicity is 90 mL/kg. For average adult weighting 75kg, that would mean 6.75L. However, for an infant with 4kg body weight, that would mean just 360ml, with is about two small glasses of water. Also, healthy adult kidneys at rest can excrete 0.8L to 1L of water per hour. Obviously it's much less for infant. 

Yes, programs can be illegal in many jurisdictions. For example distribution or sale, and in some jurisdictions even possession, of tools (be it physical or software), which exclusive use is hacking is illegal in most countries. For example 18 U.S. Code § 1029 - Fraud and related activity in connection with access devices: 

I've seen quite a few articles written on subject, mainly based on anecdotal evidence and with generally alarmistic tone. Allegedly modern turbo-diesel engines used in popular cars are much less durable than equivalent gasoline engines. Allegedly injection system frequently clogs up, turbine is easily overheated, DPF filter clogs up, even though it shouldn't. All ending in very expensive repairs. Example of such claim: "Turbo-charged cost of diesel cars" in The Guardian. 

It is standard to use TEMPEST protected terminals in military (NATO standard requirement), banks, embassies, government installations etc. The buildings themselves are usually also TEMPEST protected. TEMPEST protection of hardware is basically shielding equipment and cables with metal, which acts as Faraday cage. Which also has another side effect — it gives some protection against EMP attack. BTW. the question gives away the answer. Van Eck's paper was published and peer reviewed. 

source: "Storm Scents: It's True, You Can Smell Oncoming Summer Rain" in Scientific American. Of course you at that point you won't be "predicting" the rain on the smell alone. A that point most likely you'll see other indications that the storm is coming: big dark cumulonimbus, gusty winds, drop in pressure. Note in picture below (storm supercell) warm updraft passes through the storm cell and comes down well in front of it. Also the cold downdraft precedes the rain. 

Assuming percentage of "unsecured" users from the quote are correct, Leo Laporte is basically saying that 50% of OS X users = 20% of Windows users. Based on Gartner's data, current global market share Windows is 94%, while that of OS X is 4.5%. Taking Leo Laporte's "unsecured" percentages, "unsecured" OS X users are 2.25% of total, while "unsecured" Windows users are 19% of total. Claim that these numbers are equal is beyond ridiculous. 

No, we cannot. Sachs poses it as purely economical problem, while in fact the most poverty stricken regions are either at war with neighboring countries, having a civil war or both (and it's actually hard to tell, as country borders don't coincide with ethnic regions). The poorest region of the world is Congo and it's neighbors including Uganda, Rwanda. That region is at constant turmoil, with numerous belligerents ranging from ethnic, religious or plain crazy (eg. Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army). Just in that region you have: 

The news originates from Centro de Estudios Borjanos (Study Center of Borja). It has been originally reported on their blog on 7th of August. 15 days later it has been picked up by regional newspaper Heraldo de Aragón.

The painting itself has been mentioned 2 years ago in one of Centro de Estudios Borjanos information bulletins (Boletín Informativo nº 129-130 of 2010) 

What I've read (can't quite find the reference now), is that music with lyrics decreases you concentration because your brain will involuntarily interpret what the song is saying. Obviously, classical music, like Mozart, is purely instrumental.

This really depends what you mean by where Euro banknotes are from. It can either mean by which country they are issued (which would be most logical) or where they were physically printed (note, that physically printing is not done by all Eurozone countries, and some non-Euro countries do the printing). In either case you can find information in the numbers printed on banknotes, but only in the first case it's the serial number.
