Definition 2, is more ambiguous and allows for broader application, to describe when the increase of some factor does not yield in a significant increase in the overall value (i.e. Wearing shoes on hot coal stops your feet from getting burnt. Person A has more pairs of shoes than Person B, so Person A's feet will be less burnt than Person B.). In Philosophy this idea has several applications; e.g. to contend with the concepts of maximization of Utilitarianism, or John Rawls's discussion of distribution related to Social Justice. 

I think it is fair to say that Marx looked at all religions as a method of pacification of the masses. As far as Judaism in particular, for the time and place, there was a predominant antisemitic sentiment. There seems to be some particularly poignant information regarding Karl Marx's father, Heinrich Marx. H. Marx having lived during the post Napoleonic era of German control of the Kingdom of Prussia, experienced a strict Lutheran based social environment. Antisemitic rhetoric for that era would not be uncommon. So much so that Heinrich Marx, whose father was a rabbi, converted from the religion. I don't mean to say this is definitively an account of what occurred, nor was your question about why he may have been an antisemite. P.S. This was an interesting question. I really enjoyed delving into the "Napoleonic Jewish emancipation" and about Heinrich Marx as well. 

First and foremost, this is a tragedy for all those directly affected as well as so many people in the wider society. I hope that the focus in the response is not offensive or callous towards this or any other event like this. I would argue that the OP reference to a "disproportionate impact" is not appropriately contextualizing the event. The "absolute damage" the OP describes is quantified by the human casualties of the attack. However, the purpose and damage of a terrorist attack is wider than the tangible impact. The damage extends to the creation of fear and disruption. Demonstrated when attacks do not include any military or political target, the intent is to strip any sense of security which is foundational to society and to chip away on the morale of a population. This demoralization is a historically significant mechanism of attacking an enemy in many forms of competition; psychological warfare, ideological conflicts, politics, etc. It is important to counteract these effects and reinforce the collective unity. To do this, we share in the pain and loss. We demonstrate strength through support. If we are undeterred to live our lives together and not dissolve into hate, it is a triumph over terror. 

I'm not familiar with any contemporary treatment of "Nature" as single conscious entity, so I'm unsure in what context you are using "speak". Nature is a construct, and an amalgamation of many things. It does not speak. Math is a language in that there is syntax, as well as many defined terms and symbols. But it does not have grammar, and the use of variables is used to replace a set of linguistic expressions, which, in a purely mathematical environment, would not express themselves as anything but an undefined variable. 

Yes, Machiavelli urged that the monarch must rule using fascist authority because it was the responsibility by birthright. He goes on to explain that it is a necessity that benefits the people, as they are meant to be ruled, given the dialectical relationship between ruler and vassals. Hegel describes a similar relationship which he identifies as the "Master and Slave" relationship (though Hegel discusses it metaphysically, while Machiavelli believes its Divine Ascription and therefore a literal application). 

Here is a link to an explanation of philosophy and logic arguments. LINK. Specifically, I point to the following, as I believe you are misusing the term "argument". 

*1 I find that this position is antagonistic to both classes, and I would challenge that "being in the Bourgeoisie" does not necessitate an interest in exploitative practices. Though, the proof is in the pudding and it is only if the Bourgeoisie takes it upon themselves to fairly allocate the profits to both themselves and the Proletariat workers in a more reasonable distribution that they would set a different precedent and possibly dissuade someone with Marxist leanings. *2 Bare in mind that the concepts of society and wealth Marx was exposed to predates the modern social setting. Changes in society have enabled new results - for example, concepts like the "American Dream" of self attained success through hard work demonstrate a pathway to break this exclusivity. However, a Marxist (or Conflict Theory sociologist) would argue the ability to achieve social and economic ascension is still impeded by many of the same (and new) institutionalized hurdles; i.e. access to education, the access to financial opportunities (loans, etc.), social connections (business connections resulting opportunities). 

The core of this questions is the "Mind-Body Problem". There are two general sides to this discussion; Dualism, and Materialism. Often attributed to Rene Descartes, mind-body dualism is the concept that there are two separate but interacting portions of our existence; the physical brain and the ethereal mind. To the dualist the mind is a quality in and of itself, and it interacts with the brain to manifest intellectual understandings. Opposing this view is materialism, which argues consciousness is completely dependent on the physical body, i.e. the brain and the mind is a manifestation of the brain. I would refer you to Rene Descartes, Daniel Dennett, John Searle, and Thomas Nagel as some good sources to begin framing the two perspectives on the question. Here is a discussion with John Searle that discusses many of the foundational points and counterpoints to this debate. (LINK) 

Utilizing this foundation he points not to specific laws, but an obedience to this nature that can bring about collaborative and compassionate interactions between all of humanity. 

This can be paired with the "hot hand fallacy" which uses the same flawed reasoning to say that the pattern of a series increases the likelihood of it continuing. In this case, "If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row", the belief is that it will continue to land on heads again. Or the fact that a person has guessed correctly what face would be up 10 times, means that they are more likely to be correct the 11th time. LINK 

If you believe that there is value in the Philosophy SE, then you must accept the premise that philosophy and Popular Culture are intwined and that it is an additive relationship. While I agree that "from the standpoint of the educator these interpretations can be quite annoying and watered-down". It is important to acknowledge that the watered-down presentation of philosophy isn't a new occurrence, nor is it solely related to the onset of contemporary Pop Culture. Rather, the fact that philosophy permeates beyond the strictly scholastic offers an opportunity for more people to engage with these ideas. In that way, it is partially thanks to our culture that these ideas are being discussed generally, and the ideas are being interacted with (to varying degrees of depth). The best thing we can do - and the only thing any philosopher has ever been able to do - is further the discussion, and there in lies the authenticity of philosophy in Pop Culture. 

[Argument 1: Supporting Bob's action to be considered Moral] One way to look at this problem is to consider the NET effects of Bob's decision. As you described the scenario, you are attempting to establish a net positive end; referring to John's reform, the children's benefit, and the restitution of the Banks loss. With the certainty that this will be the series of the events intuition would push us towards accepting the outcome as moral. [Argument 2: Against Bob's actions to be considered Moral] However, we may also want to balance this perspective with the question of whether the ends justify the means. Popular opinion stands that this rationality to justify a immoral act is not acceptable despite the beneficial results. This position is established by considering the universality of application problem. Morality is considered to be a universally applicable set of guiding principles; both in a variety of situations as well as in magnitude. If we accept that the ends justify the means, then if the NET effect is positive we should act. This logic would also support less positive biased scenarios. This means, we must look at the scenario, not based on the specifics that describe the victims and benefactors. Instead we investigate the set of facts that describe the action itself. When we shift our focus in this way, we limit the scope of the original question to two important facts: 1) Robbing a bank is immoral. 2) Bob knows exactly what John will do in the immediate future with the $100.00. Given these two facts - as explicitly provided in the scenario - we would say that providing the $100.00 to John is tantamount to participating in the crime. We should also discuss Argument 2 in terms of the vulnerability of consequentialism to lead us to unintended disaster. The product of consequentialism often results in the diminution of individual rights for conceived maximum benefit of society. Is it right to accept the pain suffered by the bank teller held at gun point as the price of benefitting all these other groups? If we removed some of the minor positive effects, and said for instance "John died of drug withdrawal in prison". Are we still justified in saying it's a minor lose for a greater benefit? I would argue the Lockean consideration of natural rights, which are inalienable for all mankind, as the preeminent consideration for social justice and morality. You may be familiar with this concept as adopted by Thomas Jefferson and expounded in the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. It is with these considerations that we must not allow the ends to excuse the means. Since there is no consent by the Bank or the Teller, even after restitution, the original act is not morally justified. [Argument 3: Against Bob's actions to be considered Moral] Next, we should consider what moral responsibility we truly own given someone else's actions. It is not that giving $100.00 to another is implicitly immoral. Therefore, it is precarious that we should consider that act immoral given the before-mentioned consideration of establishing a certain degree of universality in our ethical definitions. It is the fact that Bob knows what John plans to do, and in this scenario can even know that John definitely will commit this crime in this series of events. Given Bob's perfect knowledge of the future, he is wholly accountable for those series of events he has set in motion. Even without this perfect knowledge, if John were to declare his intentions, Bob's moral responsibility would be to withhold the money. This also explains why the same moral responsibility is not applied to gun dealer, who had no knowledge of John's plan. [Argument 4: Morality is ambiguous in a world of predestined events] Lastly, we have a innate contradiction in the scenario: Given a perfect knowledge of future events, is it reasonable to consider there to be free will? Without free will, how can we consider anything moral or immoral? We don't consider that a tree that has fallen on your house, to be an immoral tree. Nor do we consider a tree that, in it's pursuit for nutrient, breaks into our foundation or suffocates underbrush, immoral. The tree is morally ambiguous because it doesn't exhibit free will, or make decisions in a conscientious way. It "acts"; it grows and interacts with its environment, but only passively. Given that this is a hypothetical question, we may be justified in saying that morality doesn't come into play in a series of inevitable events. Unless we add that Bob exclusively has free will to change the course of events that he predicts, Bob is either supposed to give the money or not, and that he would know which he was required to do. It may be regrettable, but it is not a question of morality.
