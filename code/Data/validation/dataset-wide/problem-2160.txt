Nit picking over details like this, especially if it is only done for you, likely indicates that someone is unhappy with your performance and is trying to build a case to have you dismissed or otherwise encourage you to resign. Just because your line manager or the MD "helped" you when you provided incontrovertible evidence that you were unfairly singled out does not mean that they are on your side. Likely one of them is the driving force behind your arrival times being closely monitored and your pay being docked. It would be rare for HR to act like that on their own initiative. As docking your pay is likely a symptom of the way they are responding to something else that the MD and/or your line manager see as a deeper problem, you need to try to understand what that deeper problem is. It would also be in your favor to ensure you are never late as that will eliminate this avenue of attack for them. 

Depends on the culture in your company, but it won't hurt to just tell your supervisor that your colleague could need your involvement and if he's OK with it. Having a chat in the coffee break probably doesn't need your supervisor's OK, but attending meetings is a little more involvement. In my current company it is encouraged to help each other, but as we account every single minute of our worktime to a project, sometimes there are agreements needed, if the involvement takes a certain amount of your worktime. 

I'm going to go along with Aaron Hall here and suggest that perhaps this "small faction of insubordinate employees" knows (or thinks it knows, anyway) a bit more about your product and (especially) the process required to deliver it than you do. You believe them to be indispensable. There is a reason for your belief, right? On the other hand, they could just be a bunch of Prima Donnas, but before firing the lot wholesale as many here suggest, and risking the continued success of your business, I would try to root out the source of the insubordination. I'd also be as specific as possible when you approach them, individually or collectively. That is, instead of "Why are you being insubordinate?", something more along the lines of "When I told you to do 'X', why didn't you want to do it?" 

Answer his call once and tell him again that your company didn't choose his product and that his constant calls are reflecting badly on him and his company. If this doesn't work just put his email and phone number on a ignore list. 

Usually lunch is a more or less informal part of an interview, the interviewer gets to know you a little better in a more relaxed environment and maybe on a more personal level. If you didn't impressed them tremendously in the formal interview, I guess you're out now. 

Be very leery of "Encouraged but not required". I've no doubt that those who told you this were sincere (or thought they were), but if you choose not to participate, you'll likely gain a reputation as "uncooperative" or "not a team player". - Your boss asked you to do him (or her) a favor, and you declined. What do you think that will plant in his mind? That's been my experience anyway. Your safest course, in my opinion, is to simply re-tweet as some mentioned above 

Add an agreement to your contract with the client that the deadline of the contract is met, when you submit the app to the App Store. I assume (I have no experience with Apple's review process) that you get a reason why your app was rejected. If the reason is a client requirement, you shouldn't be responsible. If it was your design decision, you should be responsible. I'm aware that some clients may not accept such clauses in the contract initially, but that's the whole point of contract negotiations ;-). 

Development is not limited to negative feedback. You can also provide suggestions on skills that can be further improved, new skills that can add value to the team and so on. For example, you might say this person is a strong team member and more junior members would benefit from being mentored by him or her. 

Knowing how to help yourself find relevant information is critical to on the job success. Like it or not, Google is a powerful tool for quickly answering questions. It's a good idea to do a quick search before asking others. It's like calling tech support and being able to say you already tried rebooting and it didn't help. 

In the end all the stuff you explained breaks down to "Can my manager order me to go on a domestic 2 day business trip important for the company, if traveling was never discussed during hiring?" From my point of view this is not an unreasonable request to a developer. Due to the described circumstances it may be possible that you can discuss yourself out of this trip, but be aware that your manager may flag you as "difficult" and that requests for 2-day business trips will occur in the future again. I'm fully aware that traveling may be a burden. I have 2 little kids and my wife works as well, so organizing around a trip is often a PITA. But I think in the field of SW engineering it's part of the job. If you are really afraid of traveling, maybe it's best to look for a new job and discuss possible travel duties in the interview. 

If your manager had you working on a project for several months, his manager must have been aware that you were working on this project. You should approach that person, even if they are in a new role, for advice on the status of the project and how to proceed. 

Your thought process seems pretty reasonable. I would call or send an e-mail to your contact in the company and explain the situation as you have here: 

This looks like your boss is considering on these times, what issues are still open and then calls you to get these items off his to do list. Maybe he's on his way home and now has the time to make a few phone calls. If these calls are clearly outside your work hours, I would just ask him, if it's OK that you answer these non important questions on Monday. I assume that you see, if such a call is urgent or not. 

As others have noted, money talks. Presumably, your company will adopt suggestions on the basis of some objective criteria. Something along the lines of "Adoption of this suggestion is estimated to increase corporate sales by X percent", or "This will cut costs by X dollars". Why not allow the participants to share in this? Keep giving the free stuff to all participants, but give those whose implementations are adopted some percentage of the benefit expected to be gained. Like: "if your implementation is adopted, you will get 1% of the increased sales (or decreased costs) over the next quarter"
