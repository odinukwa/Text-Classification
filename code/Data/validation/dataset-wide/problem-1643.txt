From the same site: $URL$ As a bonus a study proving that fruit juice causes obesity: $URL$ (1) Fairchild, G. F. 1993.

Apart from them it is a condition which is quite common in people who are running a marathon and loose a lot of salt through sweating, while drinking too much water See eg: $URL$ This is also true for less intensive sports: 

This comment should also apply to Isles own study. Here is the graph that should support the fact that there is a jump in pedestrians killed the year the legislation is passed: It shows the number of pedestrian casualties, scaled to 100 3 years prior to the law. This means that there is no confidence interval that year (everything scaled to 100). Interestingly enough, one country (Belgium) was excluded in the rest of the analysis of Isles, because their model did not fit well (!)*, this already means that all other confidence intervals are underestimations of the true uncertainty. But even disregarding these facts, it is clear from the remaining confidence intervals that their width is a lot bigger in the 'law year'. which makes the above comments more relevant again: if one county is included/excluded, the effect prior to the law would be small, but after the law would be big. The reason that the interval suddenly gets large is due to 2 things: the fact that scaling was done 3 years before (and autocorrelation is becoming less important), but also the fact that car usage was seriously changed in some in the same years due to the oil crisis. I also don't think the presented model fits the data nicely after the law year. The large jump in the 'exponential with jump' line seems too large in the law year, but it is that effect which is used to prove that there is a 8% increase. (* Being Belgian, I can imagine that they somehow changed the way that statistics were gathered and that that caused the strange numbers. If however no reason is found it would be plainly wrong to exclude the data because they don't fit an exponential trend seen in other countries.) 

They model the crime rate in NYC over the period 1974-1999 as a function of economic indicators, demographics, and deterrence measures, including: 

However, this tweetstorm alleges that Politico's account of the incident is wrong or misleading. Among other things, he says that the bank filed a foreclosure action, but it was dismissed by the bank when the error came to light, they did not foreclose and the woman did not lose her house; and that the foreclosure action was not brought by OneWest in 2014, but in 2016 by CIT Group (which acquired OneWest before this suit took place in 2016; Mnuchin was the head of OneWest, but was only on the board of CIT Group). I can't seem to find the court filings he refers to in the tweetstorm. Is Politico's account of the incident correct? Is Senator Merkley's? If there are errors, what are they? What parts of the story are accurate? 

Currency in circulation has been increasing steadily during the entire date range under consideration: 

Looking for data on this, I found a 2006 Pew Report based on INS data from the 90s, an INS report and a GAO report from the early 00s, and there's also a recent DHS report. But it's not clear to me that there's any recent estimate of either (1) how many Mexicans currently in the U.S. illegally (including those who entered decades ago), entered legally and overstayed, or (2) what percent of the current flow of illegal Mexican immigration to the U.S. is by legal vs. illegal means of entry. Is there data to support the BBC's claim? 

The distinction also matters because wastewater can be disposed of in a different state than the one in which the oil was extracted (see e.g. this, this), which raises a whole bunch of new issues for policymakers and legislators. Per USGS: 

Yes HIV is a sexually transmitted infection. The page you mentioned [*] gives plenty of proof for that. Let's just have a brief look to the population of the study: 

Drinking water during an exercise can make sure that you remain hydrated [1] or get rehydrated[2] both improving the performance. [1] 

Even if some of they did not do so, the group is still not representative at all for a population of people which usually don't know that they have HIV (or don't know that their partner has HIV). Apart from that, there is a lot of ongoing research on what is called 'superinfection': infection with a different HIV type once you carry HIV, and at least some studies indicate that chances for infections become lower: see eg: $URL$ [*] $URL$ 

In that paper you will also notice that some people lose a lot of salt through sweating, and for those people salt intake has to be higher. Finally since this site is about skepticism: some groups are clearly vulnerable to hyponatremia. For those people it is perhaps a bad advice to limit salt intake. The major reason why salt is seen as 'bad' is the fact that it causes high blood pressure. But it only influences high blood pressure in a relatively small group of people. See eg: 

Certainly not. Salt is necessary. If you don't eat enough salt you may end up with hyponatremia. From wikipedia: 

This study records monogame couples, who knew that they carried a disease which their partners did not carry. This also implies that they know about the danger of the disease and methods to circumvent infections. At least for me it does not come to a surprise that no infections happened and that precautions were taken. Your question states: 

It was also condemned by the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, whose president said that the hospital's policies had drastically changed in the new plan: 

It also notes that 9.3% of SNAP expenditures are on "Sweetened Beverages", a broader category which also includes many beverages not considered "soft drinks": juice drinks (containing 50% juice or less), juice blends and smoothies, sports and energy drinks, sweetened instant tea and hot cocoa mixes, and similar items (see report, appendix B-19, B-20). (Compared to 7.1% in non-SNAP households.) "Sweetened Beverages" is the #2 category by expenditures among SNAP households. Also see the following tables, which compare the top food items and top food categories purchased by SNAP and non-SNAP households: 

3. The main mechanism by which it was once thought that levonorgestrel might prevent implantation is by affecting the endometrium, but studies later suggest that levonorgestrel has no meaningful effect on endometrial receptivity. In both in vitro studies and studies on humans, levonorgestrel has no effect on endometrial receptivity when administered in an emergency contraception dose. From "Effect of levonorgestrel and mifepristone on endometrial receptivity markers in a three-dimensional human endometrial cell culture model", 2009 [3]: 

This is not to suggest that repealing the ACA would bring about that many deaths; the reduction in number of uninsured US adults due to the ACA is not equal to the total number of uninsured adults in 2005. But, at the population level this suggests a ballpark number of approximately 1.2 deaths per thousand uninsured adults per year attributed to uninsurance. (44789 deaths in 2005 among 18-64 year olds attributed by the study to lack of insurance, divided by the 36.864 million adults aged 18-64 who were uninsured in 2005.) For comparison, the article Sanders was referring to (which uses risk estimated by a different study, not the study we have just discussed) assumes there will be about 1.25 (36000/28900) deaths per thousand uninsured per year. Other studies on the effect of increasing health insurance coverage and other health care reforms suggest this varies tremendously by state: 

The efficacy of government safety policies on traffic-related fatalities: Empirical estimates from Japan McCornac, DC Applied Economics [APPL. ECON.]. Vol. 25, no. 3, pp. 409-412. 1993. 

In Belgium there is a well known and documented case (I think it even included video footage) of an asylum seeker which died this way during her expulsion, so I guess there is at least some truth to it. Definitely also depend on other factors as the type of pillow and the force applied. Read about the case here: $URL$ 

If this would be a common practice someone would be able to prove it If somebody would find a proof it would most likely lead to a legal case. Such cases exist: see eg (1) cited in the paper you provided yourself. It is a criminal offense. It will likely happen sometimes, but that does not convince me that it happens by default 

Not drinking sufficient water will lead to dehydration, especially in endurance sports. If you search for dehydration and sports you will find a lot of references, I just give one example which also describes why dehydration is a problem in endurance sports. MURRAY, R. Nutrition for the marathon and other endurance sports: environmental stress and dehydration. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 24, No. 9 Supplement, pp. S319-S323, 1992. 

It is true that this assumption was not proved. But the reverse, that the risk compensation effect is not negligible is also not proven. Even if a correlation would be present proving that more fatalities occur after introduction of the law, it still does not prove a causal link. 

Pure fruit juice already contains plenty of sugars, in similar amounts to most soft drinks, why would more sugars be added (unless also water is added)? Regarding health, it does not matter whether this sugars come from oranges or from corn. Fruit juice is full of sugars - and should therefore not be consumed in large quantities. 

This USGS Myths and Misconceptions page explains some of the differences between fracking and wastewater injection, and why wastewater injection and not fracking is the cause of most of the recent induced earthquakes in the central United States. You may also be interested in the video What's Behind the Earthquakes in Oklahoma? by Stanford geophysicist Mark Zoback (spoiler alert: it's wastewater injection, not fracking). 

In other words, legislators who had been contacted more frequently by (for example) constituents in the "patients" category, were more likely to say that the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation mattered to patients in their district. Note, however, that 

If levonorgestrel does not prevent ovulation when administered at this late stage, what accounts for its effectiveness in this period? Well, first, it's not at all clear that it is effective when administered just before ovulation. For example, in another study comparing the effectiveness of levonorgestrel (which does not prevent ovulation when administered just before ovulation) and ulipristal acetate (which does), ulipristal acetate was more effective at preventing pregnancy. From "Ulipristal acetate versus levonorgestrel for emergency contraception: a randomised non-inferiority trial and meta-analysis", 2010 [9]: 

Levonorgestrel is not effective at preventing pregnancy in women who have already ovulated. The product labeling does not reflect evidence showing that levonorgestrel does prevent implantation by some identifiable mechanism; only uncertainty about whether or not it could. The main mechanism by which it was once thought that levonorgestrel might prevent implantation is by affecting the endometrium, but studies later suggest that levonorgestrel has no meaningful effect on endometrial receptivity. It is not clear whether levonorgestrel has any effect on pregnancy if administered shortly before ovulation, and if it does, it is not clear by what mechanism.
