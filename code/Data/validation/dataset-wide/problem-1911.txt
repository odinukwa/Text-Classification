Instead of debating over whether or not this is bad meeting etiquette, I would first find out if her behaviour bothers other participants, disrupts / slows down the meeting in any way or causes any noticeable concrete problem. If so, you can go back to her saying that she is wasting other people's time and/or causing problems and politely but firmly ask her to change. If not, you should just accept her behaviour. Meetings are about solving problems and making decisions, not about etiquette. It is also possible btw that she is from a different cultural background than you, where her behaviour is completely normal and accepted, whereas in your culture it may not be. Then again, unless there is noticeable harm, you should try to accept that people and cultures are different. Update To clarify, and to reflect on comments: my point is that what the OP expresses above is basically his personal opinion (being annoyed by the other person's behaviour). He certainly has the right to be annoyed, as well as to ask the other person to change her behaviour to prevent that. However, the goal should be clear first. There is difference between 

I understand your frustration about this, and I would just like to note that you need to be careful with such feelings. First of all, unless they are close friends whom you fully trust, you may need to take their claims with a pinch of salt; some people like to boast their own social status and importance. Moreover, you can't say you want more money because your friends earn more than you; you can only make your point based on your actual achievements and future prospects (which based on your story sound very convincing so you should not have much worries here anyway). 

An announcement like that of your management basically tells (to me) "you are free to secure your future any way you want, including getting a new job". Sending your CV to other companies and even going to interviews still does not oblige you to anything yet. However, you get valuable feedback and experience in interviewing and selling yourself on the job market. And since you still have a regular source of income, you aren't forced to accept the first job offer you get - you are free to be picky as yet, but if you get a really good offer, all the better. On the other hand, use the time you have to make up for your relative lack of experience. If you can list on your CV that even though you have no commercial development experience with technology or language X, but you have studied it out of passion in your free time, and/or did some pet projects, it certainly is a plus in the eyes of most potential employers. But even if you eventually stay at your current workplace, your studies will keep your brain in shape. Getting used to spending the day doing nothing useful will make you sluggish and demotivated in the long run. It is hard from this state of mind to get up to speed when the next project arrives. OTOH if you do spend your time practicing and learning, your manager will most likely appreciate your enthusiasm and may find a good use for the skills you acquired. 

Now there is specific information they can act on, a pattern of wrongdoing, and they can start looking to see what people those dates have in common and the fact that there is a pattern of items going missing over a period of time means they can be sure it's not just one forgetful employee misplacing something. 

AndreiROM's answer is excellent but I wanted to add one thing. You need to log incidents. Specific dates and items. You also need to talk to your co-workers and get the same information from them. If you go to management and say "a couple of pairs of headphones went missing" there is not much they can do. If you go in and say "there's a pattern of stuff going missing. 

There's a very useful principle, KISS Keep It Simple Stupid Never make anything more complicated than it needs to be. If something might be re-used in the future, that doesn't mean you write the re-use now. Write what you need now for the features you need now. Of course that doesn't mean you don't think of the future. This is where the tricky balance comes in. Do not write in ways that will prevent re-use in the future, but at the same time do not try and think ahead of time of all possible future requirements. I can almost guarantee that the future requirements when they come will not match your flexible class and you will end up needing to change it anyway. So this is why simplicity is key. The class should be simple, and easy to understand, and easy to refactor in the future as more requirements are known. Once you realise that no matter what you do your code will need to be refactored in the future then it becomes clearer what you need to do. All the properties of good behaviour like loose coupling, easy understanding, single responsibilities, etc are about making it simpler and safer to do that refactoring. Making an all-singing-all-dancing class will end up with you building a lot of features that are not needed and at the same time not providing the one feature that it turns out is actually needed. 

The other answers are exactly correct. You need to escalate this immediately. However - before you do so: Write down clearly exactly what the situation is. Flights booked for X, training booked for Y. Write down what you have already tried (contacted training company etc). Write down any ideas you have to try and mitigate this (is the training company even available on the correct dates? Can you find alternative training?). Note down the fact that the training people clearly only made a feeble effort to get in touch - a simple google should have found them a contact number for your company for example. That could be useful in negotiations for a rescheduling. Then go to your boss and tell him what has happened, referring to your notes as needed. Explain what you've already tried, and any ideas you have. Show that you are trying to fix this. Having the notes written down ahead of time will give you something to refer to if you get flustered during the meeting. I'll be honest. You may get fired. However I guarantee you that if you even try and cover this up or delay in reporting it then you will get fired. I'm not a lawyer but it's unlikely the company could or would sue you for an honest mistake made while performing your duties. Especially since it is unlikely they would ever get back as much cash from you as it would cost to sue! Trying to hide this though could easily lead you open to accusations of or actual fraud which have not just civil but criminal penalties involved! 

And from your part, it would be better to give them examples and stories showing how your self-study improved your skills and experience in the past, and why you are eager to continue that. This may give a much more realistic picture of your skills and motivation to your prospective employer than telling you spend on average 1 minute or 3 hours per day studying. As well as this way you avoid the dilemma over getting committed into something you may not want to. 

I think that from your points it already shows fairly well, that it is most likely not going to do you a service to continue this in the long run. 

I think you may be looking at it from the wrong end. It's not the profession / career which allows you to live in different countries, it's you who is making a conscious choice about this (and maybe rearranging your life and habits to support it). If you want to learn languages, just pick your favourite and start learning it today :-) Once you can talk a bit, you can leave for a trip abroad. Or even before. I got a scholarship to Spain during my uni years so I was lucky enough to spend 6 months there. I knew about two words in Spanish when I arrived, with a language coursebook in my pack, and spent many of my evenings studying. By the time I left Spain, I could speak fairly fluently. It was one of the best times of my life! As the example shows, there are lots of other possibilities apart from getting a proper job abroad, if you want to discover the world: 

I think you need to understand the different cultural background of people from Eastern countries (in the broad sense). In these cultures openly admitting a fault is seen as a weakness and personal loss, hence people try to avoid this at all costs and fight back at any perceived attempt to criticize them or their actions or decisions. Which of course does make it very challenging for people from other cultures to work with them and solve problems together, but this is just a given which IMO you need to understand. So if you want to continue working with them and succeed with the project, I think you'd better avoid any direct criticism, and try to frame it instead as an improvement idea, or try to give them subtle hints only and allow them to "invent" the great idea by themselves. In this way their ego will not be threatened and they can be made to accept new ideas. The obvious backside is that they will most likely take the credit for any success and any novel idea. If you can live with that, go ahead; if not, try to get out of this as soon as possible. 

You need to consider both points of view. As others already mentioned that the employer will have an "empty" seat for your position. This isn't a big deal if you work for a large company and there are several people that perform your job function. However if you work for a small company and you are the ONLY person that can do the task then you may want to make arrangements to "take work home" while you're testing the water with your new company. You could probably ask for "No Pay" or "Reduced Pay". But keep in mind that there could be a possible conflict of interest and you may want to speak to a lawyer. As you're probably aware, people have been sued for the theft of intellectual property (or revealing trade secrets to a competing organization) So to summarize the arguments 

I've personally been sued by my previous employer for "Sharing Intellectual Property" with another company when that was not the case. I had to spend thousands of dollars on litigation before my old employer stopped. My new employer was also part of the litigation and they did not appreciate this so I was "let go" and I had to find new employment. 

I was asked this question in an Interview. The position that I am interviewing for is middle management in a large company. I've interviewed for this position several times and they always ask the same (or very similar) questions. I am not sure how to answer this 

The position is for a Junior IT Manager at very large international company. The truth is that I can't see into the future and figure out what upper management is planning. They usually leave me out of these meetings. Yet on every Interview, they ask this "standard" question. 

You take off work with No Pay from a large company for 3 months then give your two week notice. HR will review your resignation and will find out (from talking to you or your coworkers) that you worked a double job for a brief period of time then they take legal action against you for stealing/sharing trade secrets. You take off work with No Pay from a small/midsize company for 3 months then give your two week notice. Owners try to determine why you left. If they lost business, they will want to find a scapegoat and may sue you for theft of trade secret or sharing of intellectual property. 

One thing to remember is that companies generally like to think that their employees will be responsible. If you turn around to a company and say for example "I'd love to start immediately as I'm really keen to begin here, but I'm right in the middle of a project at my current company and could use 6 weeks to finish that so I don't leave them in the lurch". Then you are showing that you like to finish things, that you take pride in the results of your work, and that hopefully they can expect you not to abandon them if or when the time comes for you to move on once more. Those are all positive attributes of an employee, not negative ones. 

Really it depends on what you are asking for and why. If you went to your company and said that you wanted to take an extra 2 months unpaid leave every year they would probably not be too happy. On the other hand if you said to them that you wanted to take 3 months unpaid leave as a once off to travel the world they are likely to be more agreeable. There's no guarantee, but if you can organize things to the company so you take time out during a quiet period then a surprising number of companies will agree to it. After all the experience and motivation that you gain during that time will add value to the company when you return. I was recently offered a contract where they wanted me to fill in for someone because he was taking 6 months out to go volunteer for a charity in Africa. In that case the company weren't just allowing the unpaid leave but willing to pay contractor rates to get someone in to replace him for that time! 

It most likely means that they don't have anyone with relevant experience able to test you so they are relying on you to honestly describe your skills. They are then trying to evaluate your honesty to decide how to accept that. This is what references, employment history, interviews and suchlike are about after all. I've had similar things before, I was interviewed for a Java coding job and the guy interviewing me was technical but not Java. He tried to give me a Java test and I could tell almost instantly he wasn't very familiar with Java. In my case that didn't matter as I wasn't exaggerating my skills but if I had been so inclined I could easily have blagged my way through the test with only limited Java knowledge. In fact after I was hired they put me on all future Java hires to do a proper Java test. Until they had a senior Java dev they knew they couldn't test it properly but were just doing the best they could with what they had. This may actually even be a good sign - this could be your chance to build something new from the ground up and be in at the start.
