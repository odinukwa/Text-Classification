They eat just about anything, including carrion, feces, or box of cereal you didn't quite seal up, and in a household setting will likely find and feed upon any food items available. They frequently defecate near their food sources, so if you leave food out overnight (cockroaches are most active in the dark), and then handle or eat it, chances are good that you will come into contact with any pathogens that cockroach may have been exposed to. If you have any sores, it is even possible that cockroaches could nibble on you while you're asleep! 

Of course, this is being claimed as "too coincidental to be an accident" by conspiracists. The post references a Pravda article that calls the accident "mysterious". The Pravda article cites itself as the source. A google returns a ton of matches on this story, but every one I've seen is either from a blog, or a website that is popular for unreferenced, speculative conspiracy "news" (beforeitsnews.com, info-wars.org, etc.). Were there two FBI agents killed in a training accident due to a fall from a helicopter, and were those two agents the same ones who killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev? 

I have heard that fluorescent lights are generally bad for you. The explanations range from the light being in the blue area of the spectrum: 

Have there been any studies showing a growing trend in an increase of the rate of alcohol abuse in mothers? As I expect this to vary considerably due to culture, any study showing a general increase of alcohol abuse in mothers regardless of geographic area would be acceptable (although one covering North America would be preferred, as it is the area relevant to the article). 

In the book American Shaolin: Flying Kicks, Buddhist Monks, and the Legend of Iron Crotch: An Odyssey in the New China, the author describes his exposure to, and training in, some of the so-called "iron techniques" of martial arts. The techniques, according to the author, involve subjecting specific areas of the body to repeated and consistent abuse, while treating them with "medicinal herbal mixtures". The result is that the area of the body can supposedly sustain tremendous stresses, and becomes much more durable and resilient than untrained body parts. The author trained in "iron forearm", because he feared the disfigurement of joints, and general swelling, that apparently accompanied training in some of the other variants. At one point I believe he mentioned that you could easily spot practitioners of "iron fist" because one of their hands would be significantly larger than the other, and marred by swollen and grotesque fingers resulting from them being repeatedly broken and reset during the course of training. Other styles include "iron stomach", "iron skull", "iron legs" and even "iron penis". "Iron stomach" demonstrations frequently involve placing the point of a sharp spear against the abdomen, and leaning into it until the spear bends almost in half, without piercing the skin. These styles also have a history of appearing in various martial arts entertainment movies. Have their been any studies comparing the reputed strength and durability of limbs trained with these techniques versus the limbs of athletes employing more traditional training and conditioning practices? Is the reputed resistance to piercing and cutting attributed to skin subject to this training significantly different than the properties of "untrained skin"? Edit:Here is a video of Shaolin Monks demonstrating one of the more extreme versions of the technique. Is this merely a trick exploiting the natural elasticity of human skin (which is often underestimated), or is this really the result of special conditioning to toughen the skin far beyond norm? Here is another demonstration that shows spears supporting a man's weight, with a demonstration of the supposed "iron crotch" (although the video looks like the stick may actually miss the monk's testicles, there are numerous references to demonstrations that were too graphic to be easily faked in the book mentioned earlier). Here is a monk putting the point of a spear against his throat and pushing a van with the haft of the spear. Here is a demonstration where blunt force is applied to the stomach with no apparent effect. 

(Emphasis mine) [Source] The AAP article linked at the top of this answer expands on that, indicating that Maternal IgG is transported across the placenta before birth, and maternal secretory IgA is present in breast milk and colostrum. It also offers the qualification that maternal antibodies offer limited immunologic protection when compared with protection afforded by an infant's active immune response. Another key difference between adult and infant immune responses lies in B-cell responses. Infant B-cell responses are deficient when compared with older children and adults. Until they are about 2 years old, infants have a B-cell response to T-cell-independent antigens (such as polysaccharides) that is considerably less than that found in adults (Rijkers GT, Dollekamp EG, Zegers BJM. The in vitro B-cell response to pneumococcal polysaccharides in adults and neonates. Scand J Immunol. 1987; 25 :447-452). Infants can, however, generate all functional T-cells, and respond well to antigens (such as proteins) that require T-cell help for development. Regarding the claims that too many vaccines can overwhelm an immature immune system, that simply does not appear to be true. Infants are capable of protective immune response to vaccines within hours of birth, and are fully capable of generating protective immune responses to multiple vaccines simultaneously. Approximately 90% of infants develop active protective immune responses to the primary series of diptheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, Hib, and inactivated polio vaccines given between 2 months and 6 months of age (Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA. Vaccines. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: WB Saunders Co; 1999) 

Researchers are taking a closer look at the more subtle effects of moderate and light drinking during pregnancy. 

However, I don't believe that can be extrapolated to "fluorescents cause depression". Does exposure to fluorescent lighting have a real risk to mental or physical health? 

"Take over" is a bit vague, and subject to interpretation. The situation is muddled enough that it is not really valid to say "yes" or "no" to that objectively. As the question currently focuses on 1948, let's look at the immediate history lead up to, and following that period. In 1947, the United Nations passed Resolution 181, which outlined the establishment of a legally recognized Independant Arab State as well as the state of Israel. The Palestinian Arabs refused to acknowledge or comply with Resolution 181: 

I've heard this claim several times from family members, and I was highly skeptical. Supposedly the mere presence of a bar of soap underneath the mattress can ward off leg cramps during the night. The brand of soap does not appear to matter. I assumed that this was just an urban legend, yet Snopes.com indicates that this is "undetermined". Have there been any studies on this phenomena? My first thought is "placebo effect" (actually, that was my second thought; my first thought was far less polite). Have any double-blind studies been performed to test this, or are there any theories that could explain why this might be effective (beyond the placebo effect)? I find Snopes' speculation that "perhaps soap releases something into the air that is beneficial" not very credible. 

I came across this article on how to avoid carrageenan on a friend's facebook post. The "article" starts with this statement: 

The answer appears to be "no", although the research is inconclusive. Dr. Michael Kelly has researched the legendary "Dim Mak" martial arts death touch, and, according to this video, it appears that his primary theories are that the supposed "death touch" effects were likely applications of pressure upon the carotid sinus. Another possible explanation presented in the video (Death Weapons of the East, part of the History Channel's Ancient Discoveries series) is an attack on the spleen. If the spleen is damaged, it would undergo internal bleeding, until it ruptured, at which point it would potentially lead to rapid death, possibly days after the initial injury. 

I did some looking around, and found some surprising claims about water therapy as pertains to delivery. Whattoexpect.com claims that: 

No. More research is needed before such a statement could be made. As it stands now, despite investigations of transmissibility of numerous infectious agents, including transmissible blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses, to our knowledge, no conclusive evidence has demonstrated disease transmission by bedbugs [1][2] However, there are some reasons for concern regarding the possibility of bedbugs being a vector for drug-resistant bacteria, or commensal bacteria that are themselves vectors. Three residents of an impoverished community in Vancouver were hospitalized, and found to be infested with bedbugs. The bedbugs were tested for the presence of drug-resistant bacteria, and bedbugs from each of the three patients were found to be carriers:
