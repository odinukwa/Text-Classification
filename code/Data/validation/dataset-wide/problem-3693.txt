You can add cardio on off days if you wish, and if you do it right. The most important thing to consider is whether or not your body is getting proper recovery. The reason Mehdi says not to change the routine at all is because when people do, it's almost always too much. The routine is already difficult, and a BIG aspect of the 5x5 SL routine is in its rest days, your body's recovery, because you're lifting so heavy. If you're doing HIIT on your off days, your body will not be able to recover fully for your next lifting day. If you want to add a little bit of cardio, just make certain you aren't overexerting yourself. Keep the cardio light, and you should be fine. 

Most of your exercise is just cardio, so that's just burning calories. I doubt the beginner app home workouts you're doing is enough to promote muscle growth, but it probably will lessen how much muscle your body metabolizes for energy, assuming you're in a caloric deficit. So, as long as the food you are eating is less calories than you're burning throughout the day, including your exercise, you will lose weight and likely won't gain muscle. 

Is a variety of foods necessary to your diet? When exercising to lose fat or build muscle, nutrition is like 80% of your results. I understand that you need a lot of protein to support muscle growth, and generally want healthy fats and low-moderate healthy carbs to lose fat. Now breaking that down a little bit further, is it necessary to get a your proteins from a wide variety of sources, or your fat from a wide variety of food? I, personally, would rather just eat the same thing everyday without any variety, because it is easy to manage. Would it be OK if I simply ate the same thing everyday, or do I need to get my macros from a wide variety of foods? For example, this diet: Every day: 

No this is not healthy or sufficient. At 100kg/220lbs, 196cm/6ft5in, 26 y/o male, your caloric intake is pretty low. At those numbers, I would expect your maintenance level to be ~2600 calories (guestimate). If you're going to the gym, which I assume you are since you said 'Dinner (Post workout meal)', this will be even higher. Even estimating high, your daily calories right now is ~1800 tops, ~1100 of that being from your protein shakes. But my biggest problem with this diet is with the protein shakes themselves. There are some fantastic protein shake brands out there, but protein shakes are supplements, and supplements only. They shouldn't be used to replace your meals outright. Eating whole foods is the best way to get all the nutrients you need to gain muscle/lose fat. I know replacing meals with protein shakes is convenient and easy, and I might recommend someone do that for breakfast (if they don't regularly eat breakfast or something), but not for breakfast AND dinner. You lose out on tons of vitamins and minerals you can only really get from whole foods. Supplementing should only be used as means to make it easier to reach your macro/calorie goals, to "supplement your diet." Not to act as the bulk of your diet. Gaining both lean muscle tissue and losing fat is very hard, and a widely controversial topic. Many people believe its impossible to do both at the same time, since you need to be at a deficit to lose fat, and at a surplus to gain muscle. Personally, through just personal experience, I think you can do both at the same time if you just maintain a healthy diet and keep up the exercise, but that's just my opinion. Proteins - Get lots of protein, preferably from whole foods (meats, beans, nuts, fish, etc) and supplement with protein shakes if you find it hard to reach your protein macro goals. Carbs - Are NOT your enemy. Eat low-moderate GOOD carbs (oats, beans, brown rice, etc). Fats - Are NOT your enemy. Eat low-moderate GOOD fats (fish, olive oil, nuts, avocados, etc). Veggies - Veggies are typically very low in calories, but pack a ton of essential vitamins and nutrients. Get lots of veggies in your diet. I was also in your position, though not as tall as you, and this is what I did to lose fat and gain muscle. I ate healthy whole foods, supplementing with whey protein. I ate at just under maintenance calories. So if my maintenance calories was 2000 (before exercise), for example, I would aim to eat 1900 calories per day. That way, I would be at a deficit of 100 calories + however many calories I burned during exercise, around 400 calorie deficit total daily. Lastly, lift heavy 3-4 times a week. One last note: don't go crazy with the diet. The best diet is something you can maintain and stick with. If you drive yourself crazy because you cut sugar cold turkey, you WILL cave and binge on sugar. Do something you can stick with long term. If you LOVE sodas, like me, maybe instead of cutting out sodas completely, try to have 1 of those mini soda cans a day. And then cut it down to 1 every other day. This isn't a short term goal. Its a life choice. And it will take time to reach your goals. 

Lunch and Dinner: Chicken breast, black beans, brown rice, 2 servings broccoli, cooked in olive oil. Other: Protein shake, a couple hard boiled eggs for snack, multivitamins, omega-3 fish oils. Would it be sufficient to simply eat this diet every single day, or would a variety of different sources of proteins, carbs, and fats be necessary for losing weight/building muscle? Would this diet give me all the essential nutrition I need? 

I'm currently on the StrongLifts 5x5 program. I've set goals for myself to reach the "Intermediate" level based on the weights on this website by end of June next year, giving me a bit under 7 months from now. Edit: For context, I currently weigh ~145lbs, 5'7". Have been training for about 4 months. First 2 months, started at a heavy deficit. Lost 7lbs fat. Gained 3lbs muscle. Next 2 months, ate a light deficit. Lost 5lbs fat. Gained 2lbs muscle. All beginner gains, I assume. Now at about maintenance, the past week. Can't say how much weight I've gained, or lost, since the weights have become difficult, since it's only really been the past couple weeks that I've been struggling to add weight every workout. So total body weight lost since starting training is ~8lbs. Just failed 5x5 on BP for first time on last workout. Judging by the difficulty, I expect I'll likely fail 5x5 on DL, Rows, OH Press within the next 2 or so workouts, Squats within the next 3 or so workouts. (My goals are based on a 150lb weight, since by then I expect to have gained AT LEAST that much weight) Goals Bench: 185lbs ~1.2xBW Deadlift: 285lbs ~1.9xBW Squat: 240lbs ~1.6xBW Rows: 160lbs ~1.05xBW OH Press: 125lbs ~0.85xBW Currently Bench: 130lbs Deadlift: 195lbs Squat: 135lbs (I know my squats are pretty low right now) Rows: 110lbs OH Press: 85lbs Main Question At this point, I am starting to struggle adding 5lbs to each exercise for every workout, 10lbs for deadlifts. I've read a lot of articles online about the controversy behind using a belt for squats/oh press/deadlifts. When to start using one, or to ever use one. There are lots of people who say you should only start using a belt when you get to like 280+lbs squats, 300+lbs deadlifts, etc. Obviously, that's past my currently set goal. Medhi states that "once it becomes harder to add weight every workout, start wearing a belt," but plenty of people online seem to disagree. Since I've started to really struggle adding 5lbs every workout, is it worth using a belt at this point, particularly for squats because I know 135lbs is pretty low to use a belt for, even though I'm struggling to add weight every time. And at what weights did you guys, if any of you, start using a belt for your lifts? 

It kinda sounds like you might just be developing a lactose intolerance. People don't just start out lactose intolerant. People develop it as they age. After all, all babies start out drinking milk. Same thing happened to me. Drank milk and protein all the time, and suddenly started getting an upset stomach. There is lactose in whey protein, even without milk. If you get whey protein isolate however, there's almost no lactose. Try a whey protein isolate powder without milk. If you don't get an upset stomach, you probably developed a lactose intolerance. Just a note if you do decide to try a whey protein isolate. Many companies advertise as whey protein isolate, even though they're actually a blend of isolate and concentrate. Whey protein concentrate does contain lactose. So make sure you look at the ingredients list and make sure it only lists whey protein isolate. EDIT You can't develop an intolerance to isolate like you could develop lactose intolerance. I suppose you COULD develop some kind of dairy allergy, like a casein allergy, but that's not remotely the same thing as a lactose intolerance. If you develop some kind of allergy to whey or milk, than it'll present differently. You'll have an upset stomach, your lips will itch, you'll get hives, etc. Like any other allergy, symptoms will vary from person to person depending on the severity of the allergy. I suppose you could also be suffering some sort of allergic reaction to some other ingredients in the protein you're buying. For example, maybe you're allergic to peanuts and the new protein powder you're buying contains some peanuts. It could be anything. But in my eyes, its MOST LIKELY lactose intolerance.
