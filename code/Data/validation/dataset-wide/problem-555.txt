I'm not sure how much of this is marketing, but I believe the main reason is comfort. The longer seat post has more flex to absorb bumps and the seat stays being lower gives the rear triangle more flex too. Another advantage is a lower stand-over height for bikes with high bottom brackets. 

For the same reason you can't have a fixie with a chain tensioner. The load on the chain when slowing a fixie is too great and in the wrong direction for a derailler or tensioner to hold. The cage will be pulled forward and your chain will skip make a nasty noise and most likely come off or break something expensive. 

I've just rebuilt a totally stock Shimano wheel set and it had locknuts touching cones all over the place. Go for it. 

However, the easiest way to sort this out would be to sell this one to someone taller and buy yourself another in the correct size. Buying bikes whole is always much better value and you're not going to have to buy a hundred new specialist tools to get the job done. 

Buying parts alone is sadly a rather expensive way to get a bike and I doubt anyone would be able to tell you if it's worth it to you. That said, I'd be very tempted. I like old bikes and it's better they get rebuilt and used than end up in landfill. You should spec up the components you want/need and compare the price with a new one of similar quality and see which you prefer. 

Get a Campy freehub. Either you're running Campy already and there's nothing to worry about, or you're SRAM/Shimano and Lennard Zinn says that'll work just fine too. 

The best way is to practice, practice, practice! Do it enough times and it'll become second nature. When I was first starting with my road pedals (Keos, but they're pretty similar) I would push my shin against them after setting off to steady them before trying to clip in. 

Hydraulic road brakes will be out next year (at a guess). You can see leaked pictures all over the internet. On the mean time, Magura make a TT brake already, the RT8 TT. I'm not sure if you and get these if your're not Cervelo though. 

Basically, go prepared for a fast, tough, rough ride like you normally would, finish DFL and have fun. Average speeds are going to depend too much on the other riders, the track and the terrain to guess. PS. Don't be afraid to walk if you're out of your depth, just stay out of the way of the people who are riding that bit. 

You might want to look into clip-on aerobars. These attach to your existing bars and typically have a slightly less extreme position so you should be able to get away without too much of the extra fit stuff above. This'll give you a chance to see if you even want to use areobars, they're not for everyone. You're also going to want to get a good amount of training in in your new position, if your event's less than a month away, I'd be wary of making this change now. 

Another way I tried was removing the pads, and sticking an 8mm allen key in the calliper, clamping it between the pistons and holding the level down with a strap. Then you can gently move the pistons back and forth together. You shouldn't need to lube the pistons, just make sure they're clean. The in and out will lube the bits that need to be lubed. SRAM say 3-5, my Maguras took a lot more than that. 

I had a pair of Shimano PD-M545s. They were OK, but not very comfy in flip flops. There's also the PD-M424 & PD-M647 

Have a close look. On a presta valve there is a wide threaded part that the lock ring attaches to. And a narrower part with the valve lock nut above it that the cap threads onto. If the narrow part has two flat sides to get a tool onto, then it's removable. 

If you want to use these brakes 1 fingered, I would recommend moving them to the inside of your shifters to remove the overlap with your middle finger. I have all my brakes set up like this and it works great. 

Integrated headsets use sealed cartridge bearings, so extra cups are superfluous as all of the moving parts are hidden away inside. 

Yes this will be fine. The only caveat I can think of is rotor thickness, if you look closely on a rotor or read the manual, you should be able to find the minimum thickness. This is different for different manufacturers but shouldn't affect a hydraulic disc brake, they automatically adjust for pad and rotor wear and will happily clamp a pair of new pads together with no disc in between. See this question about pad material. I wouldn't worry about that either. 

I've seen people use a needle & syringe on the internet somewhere, but that doesn't strike me as the best idea. I like my tires sans holes to start with. 

What you want are satellite shifters or the TT shifters. I believe they just plug into the standard brake/shifters. 

So, yes. That said, does it really matter all that much if they don't? Stages reckon there's a +4-5% error when using them on their power meters, but recommend you just adjust your threshold accordingly. Once that's done you can carry on as normal, the absolute numbers aren't all that important, the zones you define around them are what matters. 

The usual way to do this is to use the sag as a guide. The geometry of your frame will affect the load on the shock and the pressure you need. To do this, put a zip-tie around the shaft of your shock*, or use the little rubber band if it has one and push it down against the seal. Next get dressed for riding and gently sit on your bike. When you get off you'll be able to measure how for the shock moved under your weight. This is your sag. Most people recommend between 10 and 20 percent of the total travel for sag. * Not too tight, you don't want to damage the seal. 

Strava is the de facto standard these days. Has some nice social features, like segments where your times are compared against others, friends and messages. Training Peaks is more of a training log than a social platform, has some nice features for planning and talking to a coach. Polar, Garmin, etc. have their own home made solutions. I've not personally used the Polar one, but Garmin Connect always feels half finished, I only use it to sync to Strava and Training Peaks. And of course, there are a million others, but I think these are the biggest options. 

I think you're after one of these. Does the same job as a top cap and star nut but has a hole you can run the front brake line down. 

Having looked a bit closer, I see these are tubeless specific road wheels. These shouldn't need a rim tape at all. Just, make sure no rim tape ist mounted, stick the valve in, screw it on and mount your tires. PS. This has complete instructions on page 10. $URL$ 

As long as it covers the back sides of the nipples and isn't interfering with the bead you'll be fine. The tape is just there to protect your tube from and sharp edges, getting worn through over time or blowing out down a spoke hole. See Sheldon 

Not easily. V-brake levers pull twice as much cable as a calliper brake levers, so you'll not be able to swap them without swapping the levers too, and these are often attached to the shifters, so you'd end up swapping an awful lot of parts. Additionally V-brakes are mounted to a pair of bosses on the seat stays & fork legs whilst calliper brakes are mounted to a hole in either the bridge of the seat stays or fork crown, you might have these holes on your frame, but it does leave the ugly V-brake mounts unused. Although BMX brakes seem to use the 2 boss mount like V-brakes, I'm not an expert in BMX, that's more my brothers area. 

All Shimano Hollowtech II road crank arms are compatible, however, the Deore is a mountain range. I don't think these are compatible, but I can't find anything. You might want to look for a HT2 road crank arm. The Shimano road ranges are DuraAce, Ultegra, 501, Tiagra, Sora and 2100. Not sure if these all offer HT2 cranks. Also, you'll need a special tool (TL-FC16) to install the preload cap. 

Yes, an endurance bike will be fine. I think most people outside Scott's marketing department would be hard pressed to name the differences. The main differences are likely to be a longer wheelbase, slower steering, and a more upright riding position. Maybe slightly larger tires, but you can change those to whatever you feel you need. 

There are two things to check here. Is your chain too tight? When you push on it, it should have some movement. A cm or two. When tightening your wheel nuts, did you manage to upset the cones on your hubs? Take the wheel off and turn the axel by hand, if it feels like its moving in steps then the cones have got overtightened. To fix that, you'll need Mr Sheldon Brown's help. $URL$ 

These guys make small petrol engines for bicycles. I've never seen a Diesel one though. The advantage here is they supply everything you need. Drivetrain, engine, ignition. The lot. I'm currently in Bondi, Australia and I see a few buzzing around. They look like a lot of fun. With these tiny engines economy isn't going to change hugely from Petrol to Diesel.
