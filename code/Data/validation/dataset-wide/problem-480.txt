If comfort is your main goal go the grip extensions. Bullhorn bars are not designed for comfort. They are mean to give the rider a more aerodynamic riding profile to increase speed. That's one of the reason they are so popular in tri racing bikes. 

Use a brillo pad on light surface rust. Spraying some WD40 also help. A wire brush works too and helps with stubborn spots. 

The pin needs to be pulled out. You can remove it using a wrench inserted in the kickstand for leverage to push the ring and that will loosen up the pin. If you need a visual, see this video. Hope it helps. 

Sturmey Archer hubs are finicky to say the least but once you become familiar with how to do it, they'll never bother again and they can last forever. I relied on Sheldon Brown's guide $URL$ as a base of concept. The steps I follow are: 

You'll generally want to get the smallest inner chainring possible, in order to maximize the spread of gears. The actual size of that chainring will be determined by your crank's BCD (bolt-circle diameter). It's impossible to say what size your BCD is, although with a stock 52t big ring I would guess that it's a road standard size, 130mm. This means your smallest available inner ring is 39-tooth. 52/39 is a modern standard combination, and 52/42 is an older standard; either will work. I wouldn't worry too much about your derailer capacity and chain slack. If your rear derailer can accommodate a 32 tooth cog, it must have a medium or long cage, both of which are capable of "wrapping" plenty of chain. The only instance in which chain slack becomes an issue is when combining the inner small chainring with a small cog on the cassette. This combination is horrid for your drivetrain, and ought to be avoided at all times. If you are worried about chain slack because of dropping a chain, that is a separate issue, largely unrelated to derailer/chainring compatability. 1) dropped chains are a fact of life. get used to "picking up" a chain using the front shifter to avoid having to get off the bike. 2) if it's a mechanical problem, your limit screws may be improperly set. 3) don't shift under heavy load. if you shift into a low gear while you're already climbing the hill, you're doing it wrong and you're breaking your parts. shift BEFORE you need the gear you want to be in. sorry for the pithy attitude, i've had a few beers and am striving for clarity. edit: if your cranks end up being 110bcd (compact BCD), you can go pretty low on your inner ring. You could even do a 52/34 (I do!), but you must accept tricky front shifting. 

Windows Phones + Open street map I know strava requires installation of the googlemaps app to function, but they don't make anything for windows. If you want to use their service of comparing against different users, you can upload data from another app as long as its the right format (which should be possible with any of those open street map apps for windows ). 

If it is the length of the chain you are talking about then get a new chain. but the pedal cog might also need to be replaced. More economic route might be buying a used rear cog (be warned this might be unsafe if you end up riding a lot wear will be faster) 

it might be the tire tread, the lapierre tire seems to be knobbier in the section which contacts the road, while the giant has a fairly constant height section which is used when going straight. :) 

I think your indexing might be off. Before trying Argentis answer, try adjusting the derailur's barrel adjuster to get the jockey wheels in line with the cogs. Watch this for reference 

Once you feel the gears are aligned, bring the lock ring up to lock the gear cable. As the gear cable stretches, the gears will get out of synch. You will notice that because gears will start skipping. Just tighten to gear cable by 1/3 or a turn. It will take time to get it right and it can be frustrated. If no matter what you do, the gears keep skipping, don't ride the bike as you will damage the internal mechs of the hub. I learn that the hard way. Instead, bring it to the bike shop and have then set it. Then asked them to show you what they did. 

A 70's/80's Roadmaster Pursuit bike makes a clicking noise when turning right. It doesn't make any noise when riding straight or turning left. It doesn't seem to matter how close the turn is. I have checked the headset and all bearings are fine. I checked the axle and that is fine too. I cleaned and greased both and still makes the noise. Any suggestions as to what else could it be causing it? 

This is a very old military bike, estimates say circa 1898, credited to a French officer and cycling advocate Captain Gerrard (although actually probably designed by someone else). It is indeed a folding bike, one of the first of its kind. Soldiers on bicycle were a relatively common thing prior to the first world war. Lots more information here, The BSA & Military Bicycle Museum ; and here Captain Gerard history 

You won't be able to replace that freewheel with anything new you can buy on the market; your only options will be old stock or take-offs that you can find on eBay, etc. 

Using a fixed gear develops muscles that you don't normally use on a geared bicycle. It'll take time for your body to get used to using those muscles and until then skidding will be difficult. First focus on hopping the rear wheel. When you're comfortable doing that, hop the wheel and then hold your legs in place on the landing to get a short skid. When you're used to that you can practice shifting your weight forward ("unweighting" the rear wheel) and dragging the skid out further. You must make sure your feet are in the correct position - they'll be relatively flat horizontal to the ground. Also be aware that skidding ruins tires quickly. I commute using a fixed gear and I scrupulously avoid skidding. I can stop as quickly or even faster by keeping my weight back on the rear wheel and using my leg muscles to slow down. That being said, being able to skid is a practical skill - a short "hockey" skid has saved my ass at least once from getting creamed by a car. 

I could be caused because the chain is not running a straight line from the rear cogs to the front chain rings. If you put the bike on the stand and follow the chain from the top of the cogs to the chainrings. You will see if it follows a straight line. It might be slight off so that it won't jump off when on the stand but it does when there is pressure. Another reason could the rear cogs wable. If it so, you will need to change the cogs. 

(1) and (3) gear are sort easy to set (tightest -- loosest tension) (2) is the tricky gear to set up. So ride the bike down the street and shift between gears. Keep going for a few pedals revolutions. If the gears are aligned very close, it will take a few revolutions for it to skip. When it does, play around with the gear cable accordingly. Repeat these steps as necessary: 

Simply put and ignoring a lot of variables, the answer to the question is that it doesn't matter which bike you ride. First of all, remember the law of conservation of energy: that matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed. As applied to bikes, that means that you cannot put in "less" or "more" effort to do something like climb a hill. All you can do is adjust the leverage on the gears. Remember Archimede's hypothesis that with a long enough lever you could lift the Earth? By shifting into a lower gear, you are effectively extending out a lever arm that makes lifting the weight (i.e. climbing a hill) easier. But, it also means you have to push that lever much further to lift the weight (i.e. turn the pedals many more times to go the same distance). With a higher gear, you expend more energy upfront, but you get a faster return. Now, in terms of raw physical forces, the amount of energy it takes to move a given mass (you + the bike) a given distance doesn't change. When human bodies are taken into account, the picture is significantly complicated. That is the subject of research on athletic performance, about which there is plenty of literature. For cycling, usually it boils down to minimizing lactic acid buildup, which occurs during anaerobic (sprinting) exercise. That's grossly oversimplified, but the point is that it really depends on your body's fitness which mode of travel will be more efficient for you. However, as far as physics is concerned, it doesn't matter one bit. Some other notes: 

Hybrids bikes come in various flavors between being more road-ready or more trail-ready. Take a look at any manufacturer's website and see the various hybrid models they offer and see the difference in components like tires, gear ratios, component materials, and frame geometry. Some hybrids are road-bikes in disguise and while others are just a pair of knobby tires short of a "mountain" bike. You seem to looking for one that is at least 70% road oriented. Also, Think about what is more important for you when you commute? Speed or comfort? getting to work in record time? or getting to work without any aches or pains? Just based on aerodynamics alone, it's hard to have both. Riding Hybrid bikes you will still be to leaning forward, decreasing the air resistance and going faster. Riding a comfort bike you will sit straight, increasing the air resistance and thus going slower. 

the bolt should be behind the post. but it doesn't HAVE to be. If it fits better with it in front and the angle of the seat is comfortable it doesn't matter. 

Judging by the information provided: The frame is probably bending when you stand causing the chain to come out of alignment with the deraileurs and cassete/cogs. I have a full suspension that can do that too when you pedal hard out of the seat. Did you notice if it occurs in higher or lower gears and was the chain very tight? (will help narrow down the problem) 

considering you had a bridgestone. The main builder of bikes grant pederson started his own steel frame bike company called rivendell bikes. rivbike.com they might even be able to fix your current bike. email them and ask :) 

You might have bought the wrong width chain. For road bikes/fixie there are two possibilities. These are the width of the chain. 3/32" and 1/8" a 3/32" chain will not fit on a 1/8" cog but a 1/8" chain will fit on a 3/32" cog (but with extra space around the teeth). 

Now calculating the reach is easy. We know the height of the stack is 60.25cm, which is one side of a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 63cm. Knowing this you can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the remaining side, a segment of the top tube is 18.41cm. We also know the full length of the top tube is 59cm, so the remaining segment must be 59cm - 18.41cm = 40.59cm. And that's your reach! 

Crank compatibility is largely determined by the bottom bracket interface. As was mentioned, you have a square-taper style bottom bracket, which is not used on higher end cranks these days. You can always replace that bottom bracket with a new outboard-bearing design to fit a modern crank. So, essentially, you can make just about any crank work with your bike provided you're willing to replace the BB. The more important consideration is what to get and why. Think hard about what it is you most want to improve about the bike. The cranks, in my opinion, make little difference compared to, say, new wheels, or new shifters.
