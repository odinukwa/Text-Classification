Based on my experience one will always struggle with HR being non-technical: on one side they can be "too loose", like you experienced, or on the other side they can be "too strict" on certain keywords, neglecting synonyms. Just sit down with HR and give a factual feedback on the screening, mentioning the issues you have experienced: address the issues, don't blame the screener. Ask how can the position description can be improved to make them easier to filter the candidates, and use your examples as test cases. 

Large company based in continental Europe. How to handle a project lead who refuses to use English in meetings, even though there are engineers in the meeting who are known to not speak the local language and have been hired with the only language requirement of "good knowledge of English, both oral and written"? Making explicit local language is not spoken and explicit requests to use English have been made and ignored. Addendum: Project Lead is able to properly speak English, and when asked why not using English answered that "using local language is more effective" (though somebody else has then to translate the content of the meeting) Edit: this is not a duplicate of colleagues not talking english, as the person having this behavior is in an higher hierarchical position. UPDATE Made aware of the issue, management has sent an e-mail to remind all employees that meetings shall be held in English. Reaction of the PL has been to move discussions from meetings to coffee machine stand up talks, still in local language. 

I currently work at company A. I have worked here for over a year and I love the environment, job, etc. During this time, I have also started my own side business that isn't related to company A, it is more of a product than a business. This does not affect my work at company A at all (performance reviews have been fine, getting raises, etc). I have recently launched my side business product and it is doing decently well for a single person start up. Now, while I mentioned company A is not related to the start up, it would help them in a huge way. So my boss contacted me today during work and asked me how the side business was going and I said well. He expressed a lot of interest to integrate my side product into company A. And here is the problem. He believes that because I work for the company A, my side product will be 100% free. Not only free, but work to tailor it to their preferences to fit them. I do love working for company A but I have also worked very, very hard on my product. If I am honest, I would not give the product away for free to another company(and I have not). I'm afraid by saying "hey boss, this isn't free", he will take it as if I am leveraging my position (get paid salary from company A who then pays me agin for the product). How do I treat company A as a customer/client and not as a employer of mine? How do I manage this situation without it blowing up? Edit: he never said "it's nice this will be free too", but I am very confident he believes this is the case. Having worked with him for over a year, you start to understand how a person works. 

First of all, check what is the company policy for applicants. Some companies do not allow multiple applications, for the sake of reducing load on HR (in big companies each HR can receive hundreds of CV in a day, do not expect them to do your job of matching CV and positions for you). If the company has no policy forbidding multiple applications, I would still advice you to narrow down your selection in any case. Multiple applications can convey the message your simply firing in the group or that you are indecisive, and you don't want to be labeled as the serial applicant. Set some criteria to evaluate the position, rank them and go for the top one. 

To optimize your effort, I suggest you take the no response as a lack of interest on your profile and move on. If you really want to show interest in the company/position, give a call before applying and ask some questions about the role. In this way when they see your CV they will already have you in their mind, and you will be "oh, this is that candidate who called me...". 

hinting this to most of the prospective employer sounds to them like a "hey, change your entire Excel based workflow just to accommodate for my brilliant capacity with MatLab!". Together with soft skills you may lack or need to develop (as suggested in other answers), they need to be convinced that you fit in their organization, not that their organization can easily adapt to your way of working. And don't forget, of course, that there can be other candidates more qualified than you. 

After you get a formal offer, look at your start date, look at your salary. Negotiate salary if you need/want to. Negotiate the start date to make sure you have enough time to give your current employer notice and that your new job start won't overlap. I would guess you have about 1 week to do the above. Once you accept your offer, and you get a confirmation, you notify your current employer. If you tell your current employer before accepting a job, you will probably get fired and if your offer falls through, you will be left unemployed. Even if they match the new offer, you are marked as disloyal employee so they will probably start looking for replacement. 

By invite you, do you mean to say that you expected your boss to pay for it? Or do you mean just an invitation? In either case, why would you not bring it up yourself if you knew about it beforehand? A simple "do you know about XYZ conference? I am thinking of attending and want to check with you whether it would be useful considering I work everyday on topic XYZ. Also, any chance that the company can cover the registration cost?" This seems like an issue that arose only because you wanted your boss to give you a royal invitation... (s)he may have simply forgotten to ask you or it could've just slipped his/her mind. 

Very simply, no. You are not required or obligated to go. In fact, if you truly do not want to go or not interested in the job opportunity, cancel and do not waste your time or the employers time. Although they won't be happy, it would save them time and money to focus on another candidate that is interested. Note: This probably won't look great on you cancelling last minute, so expect bridges to be burned. 

This is actually a very normal thing to do, not only in the computer industry, but also in virtually every other industry. I have found that the majority of people in cyber security for example, were usually in a branch of the armed forces. What's more important is that you go after the things you are interested in and pursue opportunities. You have just graduated, you still have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do. Because you mention the computer industry, I can confidently say this will not affect you at all. Some even may look at it as a very positive thing. This is a decision only you can make, but it certainty will not affect your future employment. You have a long, long career 

I have been in your same situation. While working in a small start up as tester, I have found a major bug in their code just one month before a fair where they wanted to present it. The bug was so severe that all the work done in the 4 months before to validate the software was just garbage. The CEO/manager blamed me in front of all the colleagues for the thing, and claimed I was being too slow in reprocessing the data (even though he said I was 25% faster than the previous tester), and pushed me to come earlier, leave later and even skip lunch breaks (at least 10 hours/day). Long story short, after few months I took the decision to quit that job and with no regrets started looking for a better position. But what helped while I was still engaged in the job and had to get through every single day was seeking (and finding) support from my colleagues. During our lunch breaks we usually had a fair share of "discussion" on the actions of the "pointy haired boss", which basically became the subject of our jokes. After building up this solidarity among us, we managed to stitch to the 8 hours/day, by leaving all when the 8 hours were due. To answer your question: try to build a safety net with your colleagues, share the burden and let out some of the stress. Meanwhile keep searching and be confident in your skills. 

I am actually asking this question in place of a co worker of mine, we will call him Bill. I am currently the tech lead of our company and one of my co workers, who I am in charge of on the technical side, approached me today. Bill is a junior level security engineer simply because he only has 1 year of experience. Having said that, Bill works as if he has 10 years in the industry, truly. Recently we have been getting more clients and Bill has had to take lead on some projects when my plate is full. Our senior management tags Bill on the emails and such and says "Hello client A, Bill, a senior level security engineer, will be your point of contact". Bill's official job title is "junior security engineer" (on his contract) and gets paid as such. Bill approached me today and asked if it is wise to talk to management about this and request a new official job title, which would come with salary, perks,etc. I really didn't have a answer for him other than it seems a bit unfair, after all, Bill does senior level work and they tell clients he is a senior, but gets paid like a junior. How should I help Bill when He brings it up with me tomorrow? Is this fair for the company to tell clients he is senior level but pay him significantly less? Thanks! 

Goes along well with stating you agree with him. Stating that you are not contradicting him is a rather convolute way to express "I agree with you" and can surely take longer to be understood. 

As opposed to other answer, and also based on what I have done for positions I really cared about, I say there is no harm in asking a more detailed feedback on your rejection. Worst case is that they will ignore your request, best case is that you will get more information. Just mind that you phrase your request making clear you want to improve yourself, not judging their selection criteria. 

Made up example: "In my present project I am working of the validation of an algorithm for biomedical usage. Without going into confidential details, it analyzes data gathered via an echo scan and assesses the health of the patient's liver. What I do is testing the algorithm by feeding it data and checking the outcome versus the analysis executed with the present golden standard. By doing this and providing feedback to the developers team, I have been able to increase the analysis rate from 8 patients/day to 40 patients/day". You don't explain how the algorithm work, but you explain your work. 

One of my previous employer wants me to update a tool that I developed during my internship. It would be remote work, part-time for about 20 hours a week, and I expect the work to last ~1 year. To make this work, I would have to make certain changes that would require significant financial commitments. How can I ask for a guarantee of employment for a part-time job? I don't want to be left with unaffordable budget if the part-time people change their minds after few months. I don't have experience signing contracts so I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to ask for: 1 year guarantee, or early termination fee. I know certain parts of an employment contract (like noncompete for a year) are not really enforceable so is something like this enforceable? I don't expect them to backtrack if they agree to such provisions ... but still, I am wondering about the legality and how often such provisions are agreed to. 

Been in this situation before with English, French, Hindi, Punjabi, and Mandarin competing against one another..! It is highly unlikely you will get them to change by simply asking them. Once an enclave is formed, it will stick until something drastic happens around them (e.g. rearrangement of their work desks to be far apart from each other). I would advise that you ask them two more times (a total of 3). If that doesn't change anything (likely), talk to your supervisor about it. Ask him/her to enforce English-only at work rule. There is no magical way to get them to talk in English. You can try and strike up a friendship with two of them individually and then mention in a light-hearted manner that you wish you could speak Telugu to get them to understand. Again, unlikely to work but if you don't want to escalate that's probably your best approach. I would strongly recommend asking your supervisor to establish English-only rule at work place.
