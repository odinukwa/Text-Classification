Just speculating... Since I don't know your routine, or how meticulous you are about your bench set up, I'm guessing what the cause of the foot slippage was. My guess was that it was due to a combination of a slick shoes or floor and not being quite as tight as you could be. The heavier you lift the more these little things become bigger issues. You were lifting a 4RM (~87.5% of your 1RM), which is significant. Had you been doing a 10RM or less weight, you probably wouldn't even need an arch to control the bar and press it several times. I find that as I push myself ever harder that the little things matter more and more. 

The most common time when we have more than six hours between meals is when we sleep. If we get the suggested 8 hours of sleep, and we eat carbs right before bed, you'll only have had 2 hours of glucogon production. To improve your body's performance, you may want to delay breakfast. If you have several small meals 3 hours apart, and all contain some form of carb, your body will be producing insulin the majority of the day. Remember, it's designed to have cycles of insulin and glucogon production. If you have those same small meals 3 hours apart, but only two contain carbs (breakfast and dinner), your body will switch over to producing glucogon in the middle of the day as well. One of the reasons that many diets suggest no meals within 4 hours of bed time is that two hours after you sleep your body is starting to burn fat. That gives at least 6 hours of fat burning at night, and more if you eat an hour or more after you get up. 

The biggest thing I can see in your exercise regimen is that you aren't doing much for your posterior chain. The exercise bike gets your quadriceps and your anterior (front) chain working nicely. The only way to fix it is to exercise the posterior chain. Basically you've developed a muscular imbalance which causes pain, posture problems, etc. The following exercises will help strengthen the posterior chain: 

You say you are the ideal weight for your height. I'm assuming you mean according to the BMI measure. Your example would be the other reason I dislike that measure. BMI is a general indicator of someone who would be obese or underweight. It is by no means accurate, nor does it take into account your body fat. So, while you can't target where your body burns fat, what you can do is change the proportions of muscle and fat at your weight. Your body is really good at maintaining weight, so that's the easy part. For you I would recommend exercise. Do something you love that will challenge your muscles. Challenging the muscles causes them to grow, and since you'll be using more energy you'll have less fat to boot. In essence, you'll be lean but muscular. Here's some potential ideas: 

Sharp pain in your elbows sounds like a common overuse injury called Tendinitis. Tendinitis is an inflammation of the tendons at your joints. It will only get worse if you don't deal with it. 

These machines are both closer to leg press machines than anything else. They will both activate the quadriceps more than anything else, although the one that has you standing will activate a little more of your glutes. Having switched to free weights for squats I can definitely tell you that the squat machines you listed here aren't going to give you the same benefits and are a lot easier than squatting to parallel with a barbell on your back. Even a Smith machine limits the amount of core work that the squats would normally have otherwise. When I was working out with the machines, started with one similar to the one you have on the bottom and then switched to the one similar to the one pictured on the top (although it was more vertical). Here are my observations: 

Sam Byrd, a power lifter, is known for his training style which would fit your needs quite well. He starts with squats running 5 sets of 5 reps, but the weight stays the same. He uses CAT to decrease the time it takes for each set, and then when he can't shave more time off of that he cuts down the rest times between sets until he can get all 5x5 done within 13-15 minutes. Once he hits that threshold he will increase the weight and repeat. He has two squat sessions a week, one for back squats and one for front squats. Sam's training methodology was outlined in Juggernaut Training Systems' ebook on squat training. Box jumps and lunges are supplemental activities. The idea behind box jumps is to generate power. You don't need to jump as high as you can, but you'll jump on to a platform for 5 sets of 5. When that becomes too easy, increase the height of the platform. Lunges should be more like 5 sets of 10. For more detail and programs geared more towards athletes who are in more traditional sports (track and field, football, etc.), Do check out Juggernaut Training Systems. You can download the 3 free training manuals which includes the squat training manual that outlines Sam Byrd's training. They also have a couple well regarded books called "The Juggernaut System 2.0" and "The Cube Method". I hate to sound like I'm plugging them, but they are a source I trust and I know they also train non-strength sport athletes. 

The opposing view seems to come from the body building community (although I am so new to this, that statement might be over simplified). The body building community tends to emphasize: 

The number I gave for fat content is the minimum amount to maintain health. Keep in mind that there is 9 calories for every gram of fat. Compare that to both protein and carbohydrates which is only 4 calories per gram. You have to eat the minimum amount of fat your body needs to maintain proper function to burn fat and not muscle. After that, you have to find the right balance between fat and carbohydrates where you feel satisfied from your food but are still losing weight. As far as supplements go, you really should keep it simple: 

Periodize. All that means is having defined times in your training where you emphasize a specific goal. An example would be, I'm going to improve my strength for 3 months, then I'm going to emphasize hypertrophy for 3 months, etc. When you plateau, add volume. He has a link in the article to scientific studies that explain why. The long and short of it, volume helps you get bigger and stronger. 

No, running downhill does not cancel out running uphill any more than driving in reverse removes miles off the odometer. Will you burn fewer calories expending less effort? Sure. But you are still burning more calories than you would sitting in a chair or walking somewhere. The biggest thing to watch out for when running downhill is uneven terrain and the added stress on your knees. When you are running uphill, you make contact with the ground faster. That provides more resistance to your quadriceps, which means: 

I personally do the Strong Lifts 5x5 program and find it is easy to follow, designed for a beginner like me, and doesn't keep me in the weight room for hours on end. You also have the option of the Pendlay 5x5 program. While the exercises differ a little bit, the following are common attributes of the strength training programs: 

From what I've read, the problem isn't the motion as much as the bar position. In short, with the bar behind the neck, it is very easy to injure yourself, and in people who lack the proper shoulder flexibility to cause rotator cuff injuries. The "press" in its general definition of a standing lift with the bar in front of the head is a very safe lift and does not come with the extra stress on the tendons and ligaments. It's also very beneficial at addressing all the muscle groups referenced in your diagram. 

The types of things you should be avoiding include sugar, trans fats, and foods high in manufactured food substitutes (like hamburger helper). Exercise is great, but you will do better if you don't count the Calories you expend against what you eat. For example, if some chart says you've burned 500 Calories from your exercise resist the temptation to eat 500 Calories more of anything. 

I would use your current maximum work set you've done to plug in to the numbers. So if you are doing Starting Strength, and your highest squat was 225lbs for 5 reps your estimated 1RM will be about 255lbs. Just note that the higher the number of reps you use for this estimate, the less accurate the formula becomes. I recommend this method if you are figuring out what to plug in to a program that uses percentages. I also recommend this method if you are a beginner. Work up to your heaviest set of 3 or 5, or pick a weight you know you can lift repeatedly and go for the maximum reps. Actually Testing 1RM Testing your 1RM requires preparation to do it safely. 

There's a couple things to consider: length of the grip, and the exercise being performed. The dumbbell handles I have don't have a lot of hand room. For me, using wider plates will change the way I perform the exercises. As a point of reference, most gyms have fixed dumbbell heads. Those heads usually don't get any thicker than if you had nothing more than 5kg or 10lb plates on the bar. Some exercises, like dumbbell rows would be adversely affected because you can't pull the dumbbell as close to your chest if you had 10kg or 25lb plates on the handles. Other exercises, like the DB bench press would hardly be affected at all. For my purposes, all the plates I put on my dumbbell handles are 5kg and below (yes, I'm American and I lift metric). 

One factor that many people training forget to think about is the amount of rest between exercises and between sets. The longer you wait, the more rested you get (to a point), but the longer you training takes. The less you rest, the more the fatigue builds up. That extra fatigue adds to the feeling of intensity. One way of looking at it is the more fatigue builds up, the less your 1RM is for that level of fatigue. Again there does need to be a balance. Training in a fatigued state can cause you to lose tightness, focus, and can increase chances of injury. Never let yourself go so far as to affect your ability to perform the exercise with proper technique. However, playing with that rest timer is an effective way to increase the training stress and volume your muscles need to adapt and get stronger. 

By applying that strategy you will be building some strength on both sides of the leg, protect yourself as much as possible during the run, and get some serious conditioning in. Strength (more muscle mass) will burn more calories while you are resting than pure cardio endurance training. 

As long as the exertion is Aerobic, there is absolutely no danger to your cardiovascular health whatsoever. Venturing into the Anaerobic zone also does not pose any danger, only that you will lose energy much more quickly. Any potential danger lies in the red-line zone. This is where you can pass out if the heart rate gets too high. Peaking into the red-line zone occasionally during training isn't a major issue, but if you start to feel light-headed it's time to end the training, and do a cool down. 

You'll need a combination of the watch and the computer software. For example, my Polar RS400 comes with software for your PC to help track your performance. The watch has several display modes, although I don't recall the "time in band" function you are talking about. Now, that watch does have programmable routines and shows where your heart rate is within the band. It will warn you when you are getting too high or too low. For me that is enough. The software that comes with the watch tracks total time in each band, allows you to review the entire routine, and reports the calories burned cumulatively. The calendar screen also shows the cumulative results for the week. It's fairly handy as I can set up my workout sessions way in advance and sync the schedule. The watch will sound off when the scheduled time has arrived, along with defaulting to the exercise on the schedule. It's great for zone training in that sense. As far as a programmable meter, you might have to look at the iTouch/iPhone or a Droid phone. The Nike software is able to get your pulse from a Polar heart rate sensor. If you can figure out how to receive/process it then you can get your custom app doing exactly what you want. 

The program with the least amount of work explanation and provides a good base of strength to pursue other things later on would be Starting Strength. Why Starting Strength? Because the book provides the best explanation and trouble shooting for the all the lifts it has you perform I've seen yet. Why not Strong Lifts? Mainly because the misinformation and leaps of logic that the proponent of Strong Lifts has is much more egregious than most things I've seen. The program itself is a good one. The exercises in each of the options listed above all work. I'm training my daughter on a program I made up. It has all the basics that she needs both for cheer-leading and for the power lifting competition she'll be doing with me later this year. This option works because I've already tested out the principles and I'm actively coaching her. If you are actively coaching, a custom program works. Honestly, this is the best approach as you can balance the load of strength training with the sports they are actively involved in. Out of the box Starting Strength isn't a great choice for someone who is in two other sports simultaneously. If you are just introducing them to strength training, Starting Strength will probably be the best bet as they can also get a lot of help from the forums. Step 3: Graduation If they stick past the basics program and exhaust the beginner gains, they won't need as much hands on training. Just give them guidance on where to go next. If they want to look good, point them towards body building routines. If they want to get better at sports, help them to think about how to balance the needs of sport specific training with strength training. If they just want to get strong and compete in strength sports, then introduce them to programs that will help them continue getting stronger. 

As to the sizes of the plates, the maximum disc (European spelling) size is 450mm or ~17". The 20kg plates reach that size, and the 25kg and 50kg plates make up for being heavy by their thickness. If you fancy doing Olympic lifting (Clean & Jerk, and Snatch), I recommend getting bumper plates for 10kg and up. They are more expensive, but are made to handle being dropped. All bumper plates are the full 450mm diameter, and vary in thickness. If you are going to stick with bodybuilding or power lifting style workouts, stick with the less expensive metal plates. Personal recommendation: I have both sets of plates, and honestly, just using the 1.25kg plates as the smallest is just fine. Unless you are also trying to outfit Olympic plate sized dumbbells, I would recommend filling out the rest of the bar with 25kg plates. So for your purposes it would be: (25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 2.50 + 1.25) * 2 + 20 = 177.5 kg That leaves 62.5kg to fill in. If you get a second pair of 25kg plates you'll have 227.5kg, and a third pair of 25kg plates and you can lift anything up to 277.5kg. Traditionally, you simply keep adding 25kg plates as needed. If you are getting a pair of Olympic plate holding DB handles, then my recommendation will change. In that case I would get another set of 5kg and below plates so you can load them up the same, and then fill in the rest of the weight with 5kg plates. Anything larger than 5kg on the dumbbell handle makes it difficult to handle properly.
