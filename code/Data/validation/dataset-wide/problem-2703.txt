which is clearly aimed at providing priveleging science over everything else. Not just music, but mathematics, language, are expressive, creative, and seeking of the edge between predictable and unpredictable - the complex, the fractal. 

Is that the criteria? This fascinating map suggests the USA is composed of 11 different cultures $URL$ with different views about a variety of moral topics, including about things like the 'state of nature'. Can we get a 'dispassionate' view of human nature? Maybe we can. But, it only becomes 'meaningful' as part of a narrative, as part of deciding how to change things, of where we should go, in a culture. In what Foucault calls a discourse. Because meaning is not disspassionate, not morally neutral. Hear the stories from different sides, pick one, become part of that side. Whichever propagates more 'wins'. The anarchist theories of Hakim Bey have been strongly criticised from many sides. Yet, his description of temporary autonomous zones, and implicit ideas about human nature or 'the state of nature' was a major influence on Burning Man, an ongoing political influence (even if only on other festivals and gatherings $URL$ ) So, it is not just a popularity contest. Hobbes' ideas aren't much more popular than Bey's. But they must be answered. It is a dialogue, about influence, about power to help give people meaning in their lives. Does it become meaningful, even as a reaction against? What shapes the group narrative? Marx looked like a winning theorist, a big influence, for a long time. But now we look at his justification of ends over means as fundamentally contradictory. His analysis of his times may hold some weight, but his diagnosis of what to do, has beeen categorically dismissed in practice. The popularity of his ideas, requires that they be answered to. But their failure in practice, dismisses them as that answer. Locke is a lot more popular now than Marx. But we need both, to explain history. 

Quantum mechanics doesn't just give probabilistic futures, it does the same to the past. The anthropic principle takes that to a futhest extent, did the presence in this universes timeline of minds, collapse the wave function into just this set of fine-tuned fundamental constants? We can't truly escape our observations being through minds, being subjective, even when we balance that by network and comparing notes with other subjective instances of mind. Cause & effect, time, materiality, all open to question. 

Turn the question around. What do you gain by not caring? If the holy texts are done with, and you wish to go beyond animalistic instincts, then in your new freedom you must use your mind to decide how to be. Being selfish, greedy, violent, and in prison, probably aren't great ways to start, so better work out where you do want to get to. It neither matters, nor not matters. Mattering or it's absence are just props. Choose your props wisely. 

I go with "Nihilism is not a choice or intellectual commitment, but a thing that comes upon you" quoted from $URL$ This article makes a convincing case for the origin of nihilism, in a loss of shared values because those of previous culture have become 'illegible', that is fail to sway you, or to be livable in or with. Lots of people will say, they have some values to share, cling on to them! But, they were answers for a different time, for different people. Trying to expand being now, present, aware, is surely the only way to a new 'metis'. This is the shaman-like purpose of philosophy surely, to find something that will sway us in new times, that can hold us together in some better, new, ways. Hakuin describes Zen practice as needing three essentials "A great root of faith. A great ball of doubt. A fierce tenacity of purpose" This article $URL$ links key philosopher to Zen Nagarjuna, with methods of Nietzsche and other Western thinkers. I take faith to be in the sense of, try meditating, and ideally go on a retreat - Zen is the least religious religion you can imagine, but it has tools that can help. Fierce tenacity of purpose is about, don't let go of this mystery, don't give up on questioning and go back to sleep because everyone else is. But the most important bit, and my reason for this quote, is the ball of doubt. On these boards, in every academic setting, and most discussions, we are encouraged to jump to answers. If we sat with not knowing, with doubt, we might learn far more about the question, and bring our whole being toward an answer. I feel this is the only way to find new truly livable values, the counterpoint to nihilism. It is to find a way to be with the meaningless, without jumping for old patterns, for comfort blankets or distractions. I don't see an intrinsic meaning in "feel hopeful and to enjoy life", or need for a rebuttal of nihilism for the sake of. A not truly satisfying rebuttal is worse than none. Camus talks about ways to be in an absurd, meaningless world. Stoics also, put forward tools which are about investigating your own capacities and options, and no longer worrying about what you cannot know or change. 

Reflecting on the nature of thought and consciousness. Even proposing this, ignores the state of your own babyhood and childhood, when you were not 'fully' consciouss, and were educated and taught ways to behave with and understand others. Being the only truly conscious morally responsible being, implies a kind of self-creating autonomy. But the language games we need to engage with the world pressuppose minds like ours exploring it and refining mental tools to investigate and communicate about it. If all that is meaningless, there is already no morality for you, just do whatever you want until someone stops you (like a psycopath). But if tgere is a concept of morality, it already presupposes a community of conscious beings that created the concept. We are not free-floating self-creating minds with apriori knowledge. Our instincts are provably altruistic above agoistic. Our consciousnesses exist as a product of community and collective thought, through eusociality. 

In string theory they posit the big bang as a collision between surfaces in a multidimensional space. It seems if there is the possibility of a static (timeless) reality, external to this one but able to have caused it, there could be such a first cause. How to think about a time before time is tricky though. Buddhist thought simply accepts infinite beings, in infinite realms, for a infinite time. In the Brahmajala Sutta (in part 40, of $URL$ Buddha explains how a deity can come to think they are a creator, but how in fact they face the same fundamental problems as all beings. This may be pointing to the idea that causation itself is a state of mind, an unawakened state, and that as long as a previous causevs searched for the next previous link in the chain can be found, but that only gives us the truth of the lack of any inherent nature, that everything we ordinarily experience is conditioned and dependent.
