There was a problem, however: the notion of a perfect God as an object of the theory prevents the property of 'positiveness' from being useful in this way. The problem is precisely that as a mathematical structure, the 'positive' predicate singled out a single object, i.e. what Gödel would identify with God, which more or less defines the positive property in that a property is positive if and only if God has that property. p. 2–3: 

What I have tried to suggest above is that even within mathematics itself, there are multiple approaches that one may take to investigating approximations to some number. It is true that some methods are easier than others, and for that reason may be easily reproduced by independent ingenious minds. Whether or not these easily-reproduced ideas are enough to find the pattern of the number to be approximated is the crux. There exist numbers which simply have no pattern, and also numbers whose pattern is more complicated or harder to extract than others. The same is true of conceivable physical laws. As an apparatus for describing relationships, mathematics can describe any pattern worthy of the name, but there is no reason why everyone should be so lucky as to stumble upon the same description, or even on descriptions of the same accuracy, unless the universe happens to be quite simple. And we can never know for certain that it is very simple — for after all, like a Liouville number which 'masquerades' as a rational number, any long-standing simple law may be subtly incorrect in a way that just the right nuanced insight from a different point of view might be able to anticipate. 

a desideratum D: something that one would like to accomplish a necessary condition N for accomplishing D. This may often also be a sufficient condition (modulo some actions which one assumes are easy), but often it is something which must be satisfied before D can be accomplished. a sequence of necessary conditions N1, N2, ... , Nn where N = N1, where for each j < n, the condition Nj+1 is a necessary condition for Nj, and where either 

It should be understood, to start, that any answer to this question will be entirely speculative — this is not a question of logic, but of physics, i.e. it is an empirical question (albeit about a phenomenon that no-one has ever knowingly observed and reported). Any answer we provide is merely a proposal which could possibly serve as a principle for the development of physical theory, in any theory of physics which possibly allows for time-travel. With that being understood — The classic paradoxes of time-travel are not ones of logical consistency so much as they are ones of consistency of the historical record. There are different solutions to this, which are so well-worn that they are well-represented, for instance, in science-fiction literature. 

After a quick reading of the paper, this is what I have been able to make of it. As far as attempts to link mathematics and theology go, it at least presents some nuanced ideas (that no object accessible to us is perfect, for instance); but it does not seem to me that this paper either proves the existence of god, or even makes any sort of strong argument in the case of god. What it does do is show how the notion of a 'positive' predicate on properties, introduced by Gödel in his ontological proof of god, very nearly represents a powerful concept which can be used to underwrite the consistency of ZFC. p. 2: 

If we assume that a name must ipso facto be nameable, we may obtain a conservative interpretation that "no name is enduring and unchanging"; or perhaps "meanings in language shift". If we suppose that the first and last 'name' actually is meant to refer instead to an idea, obtaining the reading "The idea that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging idea', we obtain a thesis about how any idea which could be communicated in words, even in principle, is unstable in time and will shift. In short, if these sentences are perfectly representative of the Tao Te Ching, it sounds as if they are only contradictory or paradoxical to a worldview which insists that a perfectly accurate representation of the state of affairs is attainable and expressible in language. It is unsurprising that a culture such as European culture, which has historically been substantially informed by revealed holy texts and afterwards believed that truth could be captured by pure reason, or even just a small amount of reasoning supplemented with a few careful observations, might reject such a premise out of hand. But at least since Popper and Wittgenstein, even (or perhaps especially) an analytic philosopher should be prepared not only to accept these notions as plausible, but perhaps even essentially correct. [1] Of course, you should bear in mind that, like Schiphol, I have no expertise in the Tao Te Ching, and that while this is a possible and possibly fruitful interpretation, it may well not be the canonical interpretation. But I suppose, by the very nature of the Tao Te Ching, that there cannot be a canonical interpretation; or more precisely, that the interpretation of the Tao Te Ching which can be uttered is not the 'true' interpretation of the Tao Te Ching. 

or again, bringing the inner quantifier outward to put the formula into prenex normal form, we may write 

What you are noting is that the definition of "sane" (also "intelligent", "athletic", "reasonable", etc.) are not so much defined recursively as they are questions of social comparisons of behaviour. Some of these are defined in terms of being similar to a perceived norm (where 'norm' is interpreted in a vaguely statistical sense, i.e. what one can expect on average) without too much variation from it; others are defined in terms of some single dimension of ordered comparison, in which one substantially exceeds the norm. Sanity would consist of similarity to average behaviour in certain respects, and in particular denotes some sort of standard of predictability. "Mad", being the opposite of "sane", would naturally represent behaviour which is at substantial variance from the norm; especially if it is a mode of behaviour which is potentially dangerous to themself or others. Dalí's ironic quote (in which he implies that he is not mad by virtue of believing that he is mad) points out one common idea of madness; that someone whose behaviour is very much at odds with what is normal, and who is not aware of this deviation (or who claims superiority from this deviation according to an obscure code of ethics), is that much harder to predict and therefore possibly dangerous to be around; whereas someone like Dalí, who is very self-conscious of his deviation from the norm, behaves in a way which is unusual but (because he is conscious of his behaviour and his role in society) is not dangerous. (Note also that dangerousness alone is not sufficient to define madness. In many countries, police are often dangerous people — but only under certain circumstances, and usually you can expect any given officer to be dangerous under those same circumstances. For instance, if you kill another police officer, you can expect to be in mortal peril. The circumstances under which you are in danger of police action will vary from location to location, but within a location there is usually some roughly-understood range of behaviour that can be expected of the police. Therefore, people will rarely be inclined to describe the entire police force as 'mad' on the basis of their potential dangerousness.) Your example of omnipotence is not so much a matter of recursive definition as it is an example of a precise definition in a domain of discourse where the notion of possible actions or properties of objects is impredicative, as in naïve set theory. The real question for omnipotence is what other properties of objects are well-formed and admit discussion as the subject of the actions of an omnipotent creature. For instance, consider a creator who made an 'immovable' rock: is 'immovability' a property an object can have in itself, when motion is described relative to some frame of reference? Furthermore, if you resolved that puzzle and then the creator then moved that rock, wouldn't this be tantamount to first removing the rock's property of immovability (which surely an omnipotent being could do) and then moving it? Perhaps the crux is whether an omnipotent creator could make a rock that she could not unmake — but is 'unmakability' a property of the object? What we're noticing here is that what omnipotence means depends on the other properties which lie in the domain of discourse; this doesn't make it recursively defined, but whether or not it is logically consistent depends on what properties you suppose are logically coherent in the universe that the omnipotent being inhabits, in the same way that the notion of an "odd number" (and the associations normally made to it) much more sense in the integers than in the real numbers.
