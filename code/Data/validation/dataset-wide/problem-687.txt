Unless you consider the crankarm length (which usually is NOT done for the sake of simplicity), you have one (or two, in the case of gear hubs) "multipliers" to get the ratio of speed (and torque) between the crank and the wheel, and one final conversion between angular speed and forward speed. That would either allow you to calculate forward speed for a given RPM, which is one of the best parameters to judge how a given gears "feels" on any bike. First you have to calculate the gear ratio between chainring and cog. As an example from one of my bikes, if you have a 46t chainring and a 16t cog, dividing 46 by 16 gives you 2.875 which is a first multiplier. Then, if I am in the 6th gear of my hub, the table from the manufacturer says it gives me a 0.528 REDUCTION ratio. So, for every crank turn I have 2.875 times 0.528 = 1.518 wheel turns. If I know that my wheel has a circumference of 2.115 meters, then for each crank turn I'll go 3.21 meters forward. Now if I take any other similar sized and similar weight bike and ride any other combination which gives me 3.21 meters per crank revolution, these gears most probably will feel very similar, and both bikes could be ridden side by side with the same cadence, even if one bike had a 20 inch wheel (that would mean the gear and hub ratio would have to be higher to compensate. Although it is possible to calculate wheel circumference from wheel radius (radius * 2 * PI), the best way is to measure - with a tape - the actual distance travelled by the bike as you push it forward until the tire gives a whole turn. Hope this helps! 

I would surely go by changing the bottom-bracket for a longer one (be it changing the spindle as you said, or installing a sealed Shimano-type one). If you don't want too much to keep your current bottom bracket with separate spindle and cups, the sealed one is much more reliable, long-lasting, play-free and water-resistant. To find out the correct size is not a trivial task, I think you should go talk to some friendly and experient bike mechanic, since there are some subtle factors involved in bottom-bracket crankset interaction, that determine the final position of the chainring. If your spindle looks long, get a shorter one and move the ring to the outer side of crank spider. If your crank is already very close to the frame, find a longer bottom bracket. OR You could play with the wheel/cog position,sometimes there are washers and nuts around the bearings that can be moved, swapped, changed for thinner/thicker ones, etc. I have a fixie with a very cheap rear hub, and there is a lot of dishing, but I don't care, I've ridden dished wheels my whole life and they worked. It is not prettiest, but it is a minimal problem compared to twisted chainline on fixies/singles. Hope it helps! 

I started tandeming with my wife as stoker, and it was suffering. She is a bit anxious on traffic, and made me too aware of low-level actions about controlling the bike. Eventually, she gave up worrying and we started to talk not about riding or about the bike, but about anything else. Then the things started to really work and we had fun. With my stepson, now 9 years old, it is much different. He has his own bike skills, and is not afraid. I needed two rides to explain what he can and cannot do, and now we just RIDE. I have a theory that, if you, experienced rider and captain, explain some minimal unbreakable rules to an accepting stoker, you never have to mention anything about shifting gears or turning or anything else. Of course not any stoker is accepting of this. But as a minimal, I would say that you must communicate EXCEPTIONAL circumstances to the stoker, because he/she could be distracted. These would be (self explanatory): 

Here is a poor photo of the actual garage with the bikes already in it, but surrounded by a lot of junk, some of which will be taken out, some of which will be rearranged in cabinets, drawers, etc. (for size reference, the old doors in the back are leaning against the wall). Notice the stacked configuration on the right, where one of the bikes leans against the wall, and the others lean against it successively. I would like to avoid or at least streamline that. 

From the photo, it is possible to notice that the lower part of the front downtube, and the lower part of the bottom bracket boom tube (the one connecting both bottom brackets) surround the eccentric at an angle quite larger than 180 degrees. The following exagerated ilustrations shows it: 

I think you should use the "recommended" way to do that (even if that means using a home-made solution: 

For simplicity, strap the front wheel to the down tube of the bike, so the handlebars won't turn; You could also strap the brake levers in the "full braking" position; Lift the front wheel from the ground, balancing the bike on the back wheel. Lift as much as necessary so the bike keeps almost falling back. Now the vertical line passing through the rear hub is the line where the center of gravity is; Repeat the procedure with the rear wheel lifted, so that you know the the center of gravity is directly above the front hub; The approximate center of gravity position is where both lines cross. 

I have a Brooks, properly treated with Proofide, and I use full fenders, but major rides while raining make the saddle so soft that it bends all the way down. That is a problem that can be partially avoided with rain covers, but you cannot forget yours never! Also, if the saddle keeps wet when you arrive, you can pull it to original shape and wait for it to dry again. It becomes even more comfortable after that. The only problem is the case where you need to keep riding (for example, on a holiday tour) and the saddle is STILL wet from yesterday. I don't know what to do then... Amazingly, though, even all the way down it is still comfortable and pretty rideable. Once, a dutch guy was crossing my town on a long tour, with his brooks fully stretched down, and he only complained from sore hands, not from sore bum. It was incredible! So, I would say: "Yes, go for it, but you have been warned!" ;o)
