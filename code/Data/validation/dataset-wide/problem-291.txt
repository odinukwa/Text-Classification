If you increase the mass of the Moon until it has the same mass as a planet, the barycentre moves towards the centre of the system, so both planets move, but the Moon's orbit would be less pronounced and the Earth's more pronounced: 

There's a difference between a hunk of metal and a dragon. We built planes because we can't fly naturally. Planes are big, cumbersome machines that don't work without someone controlling them. While someone still has to control a dragon, that someone can be the dragon itself. Dragons are built for flying. Their in-flight responses are much quicker because they get instantaneous feedback on their control inputs, so to speak. In an aeroplane, the plane provides the feedback but it is not linked to the pilot's brain and he won't immediately understand what to do - the information has to be read, understood, then interpreted according to the pilot's training. Dragons are born with the innate ability to sense changes and respond instinctively, as a natural response. For this reason, they do not need regulation in flight. They are able to fly as easily as we can walk and collisions with aeroplanes would be almost nonexistent because of their reactions. However, what we might want to do is talk to them about our own ground safety procedures. For example, the danger of close proximity to jet engines and the fact that having a dragon make its nest on 27L at Heathrow would actually be a rather serious problem for us. They might, perhaps, be persuaded to use alternative landing and nesting grounds. It's not so much about regulating dragons because they're dangerous in the air, but working together with them to make sure that their innocuous mistake doesn't cause major disruption for us. 

I think your concerns may be well founded. This city will be fairly similar to most other cities and I don't think there's a whole lot you can do about it. However, it will have a couple of good attributes to it: 

Do it over time. On each rocket launch, you can attach a bit of the required resources. Give it some small booster rockets to direct it the right way. When the rocket is at the peak of its parabola, fire the boosters to get the resources away from the rocket, into space, and going towards the moon. Given that this is an ASI we're talking about, it can change the data on launch computers to say that less of the original payload should be loaded, giving more space for the ASI's resources. Of course, this method does take a while, but you get all the stuff you need to the moon with very little suspicion raised. Of course, getting all the humans there is a very different issue... 

Meanwhile in space... The aliens picked up our signal in late 1959, almost as soon as we started transmitting it. It was weak, though - 30 light years is a long way, and the intensity of our signal was tiny. With such little signal to work with compared to the noise and attenuation of the signal, it was difficult to decipher. So, in 1960, they set off towards Earth in the hopes of getting a stronger signal to decipher. And they worked, and they waited. In 1969, 9 years after they set off, the signal was strong enough for their computer to really start deciphering - so they set it to work. 

Information We live in a world driven by information. Having access to any information, at any time, would be incredibly useful - so I predict someone would invent a brain WiFi connector. You'd have access to the full Internet of information, as long as you had some connection. On that subject... Connection The Internet is fairly useless to you if you can't connect to it. To that end, I expect someone would also come up with a satellite connection receiver, so you can always be connected. 

While uploading human personalities to robots is out of the question, giving robots robot personalities, capabilities and intelligence is not. So: Robotically Controlled Suspended Animation This method, which I shall term RCSA, makes use of robots (who have no concept of time apart from milliseconds since some date or other) to control a colonising fleet. 

Point your big telescope at the sky in the direction of your destination star. Record the image it captures. Repeat step 1 every month for a year or so. Combine the resulting images into one. Mark anything that appears round the star that is not another star, and using the varying positions, draw on a rough orbit. Use the orbits and sizes of the objects around the star to determine what they are likely to be: 

You are, however, right in assuming that we would eventually make these discoveries. As I see it, this could happen at one of two points: 

Note: for the purposes of this answer, I have assumed no tech remains. If you do have tech surviving, then many of these steps will be easier. There seem to me to be a number of steps that you must go through to rebuild a planet. 1. Water Water is the most basic human requirement and without it everyone dies very quickly. The first priority is to find a source of fresh water that people can drink. I do hope your apocalypse wasn't nuclear or this is going to be very hard. 2. Food Food is the next requirement: while you can survive longer without food than you can without water, you're quickly going to need some to be able to keep rebuilding. Look for old stashes, if there are any: anything in a tin will have kept. As soon as possible you want to start getting some basic farming going. Fishing will also be a good option, especially if you're near the sea. 2.5: Tools Tools are also fairly essential. To open tins and kill things to eat you're going to need some, even if it's just a sharp bit of rock. Start your search for tools quickly, preferably at the same time that someone else is out looking for food. 3. Shelter Start building. You need somewhere to survive. If you're already in a cave you're in a fairly good way, but you might want to consider partially blocking entrances to keep warmth in. The more people in one shelter, the better, as it will be warmer inside. However, caves can't sustain you forever and you're going to need to start building other shelter soon, but that requires wood. 4. Start Growing Trees, plants, food, start growing it. You'll need them all to survive, and many plants we think of as useless do actually have very useful functions in a survival situation: nettles can be used as string for bows and you can make tea from them (though that may be a while off yet). Trees will be essential for building better shelters in the future. 5. Start Exploring Now that your camp is reasonably well set up and sustaining itself, get a team out every day, exploring the surrounding landscape. They should look for: 

If this is a different scenario and you put it in a full simulation, unfortunately, it may still be able to tell. Very rarely are simulations entirely accurate; there are very likely some bugs in it, which, if the AI finds in the course of its time there, may cause some pretty interesting speculation on its part. Additionally, if it's sensors are good enough, it'll be able to detect that the people it's interacting with are made of pixels not cells, and are cold. While it may not know what people are really like, it will be able to figure out that a complicated organism needs to be warm for its body processes to work correctly. 

As far as I can see, your model is flexible enough to allow for this already. Since you're employing the use of a fairly large amount of handwavium, you can simply employ some more and just say that more than one person with this power is possible. There are a few major ways I can think of about how it would affect other rewinders:
