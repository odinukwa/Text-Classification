Do you know the (TVD) true vertical depth of these wells. Are you certain the wells are tapped into an oil formation. Oil wells deplete in the production sense but the mess still remains as well over time oil will seep back into the fractured zone. The clean up and maintenance of equipment would be great. There may also be the presence of other toxic gases such as h2s. Think of a oil spill on land or ocean and the coast of cleaning it up. In my opinion I be very impractical and coastly. In most cases impossible because of the differences in formations Case studies strictly geothermal Geothermal Well References 

Is there an association with thrust fault or dormant volcanos and quartz veins? Where are quartz veins likely to occur in nature and how are the formed? Is it possible to identify these veins from satellite images. 

Most of the time the ocean appears to be blue because this is the color our eyes see. But the ocean can be many other colors depending upon particles in the water, the depth of the water, and the amount of skylight. The colors we see depend upon the reflection of the visible wavelengths of light to our eyes. The Franklin Institute provides a good explanation of how we see color at $URL$ Chlorophyll estimation Chlorophyll concentrations are derived from images of the ocean’s color. Generally speaking, the greener the water, the more phytoplankton are present in the water, and the higher the chlorophyll concentrations. Chlorophyll a absorbs more blue and red light than green, with the resulting reflected light changing from blue to green as the amount of chlorophyll in the water increases. Using this knowledge, scientists were able to use ratios of different reflected colors to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. Intrinsic Absorption The reason the ocean is blue is due to the absorption and scattering of light. The blue wavelengths of light are scattered, similar to the scattering of blue light in the sky but absorption is a much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean water. In water, absorption is strong in the red and weak in the blue, thus red light is absorbed quickly in the ocean leaving blue. Almost all sunlight that enters the ocean is absorbed, except very close to the coast. The red, yellow, and green wavelengths of sunlight are absorbed by water molecules in the ocean. When sunlight hits the ocean, some of the light is reflected back directly but most of it penetrates the ocean surface and interacts with the water molecules that it encounters. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light we see is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets. $URL$ $URL$ 

While horizontal velocities in the ocean are relatively easy to measure, what methods are available to measure vertical velocities? Is there some indirect way to estimate vertical velocities from observations? 

They propose this scenario to explain the differences between the Solar System and other planetary systems in which large planets are found in the proximity of the starts. Among the many questions I have: How is it physically possible for such a migration to occur? Is there a way to verify the migration hypothesis with observations? How different would have been the hypothetical planets in the area currently occupied by Earth? If such a migration toward the Sun started, what prevented Jupiter from continuing inward and collapsing with the Sun? Is it possible for such a migration to occur again? 

Most early examples of tidal energy generators used barrages (damns) to generate electricity (La Rance, Kislaya Guba, Annapolis Royal). Meanwhile, a lot of newer projects use rotary blades in the tidal flow (like windmill blades), resulting in an installation that looks like an underwater wind farm. Examples of such projects are: FORCE (Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy), SeaGen, TidalStream... While some have claimed that the environmental effects of these new systems are much less severe, the fact is that tidal current technology is relatively new and has been applied in only a few sites. The environmental impacts seem to be based on hypothesis, modeling and simplified lab experiments, but my questions are: 

I haven't seen those videos, but in general yes, the rotation of the Earth has a major impact on weather and climate. The weather and climate are primarily driven by solar radiation that heats up the surface of the Earth and drives global winds and ocean currents. The rotation of the Earth has a major impact in this process, due to the day/night variability of solar radiation, and the Coriolis effect. For example, all storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes do rotate in the so-called cyclonic direction, that is counterclockwise in the Northern hemisphere. This is a direct consequence of the Coriolis force, that is, the rotation of the Earth. All cyclones are close to a geostrophic balance, which means that the Coriolis force is balanced by a pressure gradient force. That is why storms can last for long periods of time and travel long distances. If the Earth didn't spin, such storms could not exist. In fact, most phenomena related to weather are affected by the Coriolis effect, for example, the trade winds, jet stream, different air masses, and typical precipitation patterns. None of these would exist if the Earth did not rotate about its axis. The rotation speed also affects these phenomena. If the rotation rate of the Earth was larger, for example, then storms would have smaller radius but feature stronger winds. If the rotation rate was significantly different (say, twice as fast), it is likely that both the weather and climate of the Earth would be completely different. 

The idea of an "earthquake storm" has been around at least since 1970. Ambraseys (1970) describe multiple "earthquake sequences" lasting around 40-50 years with "quiet periods of more than a century in a nearby fault system (the Anatolian fault zone). In a study preceding the Nur & Cline work, Nur (1998) provided a possible explanation to connect earthquake damage with civilization collapse: 

These days I use: ncgeodataset. The routine allows for the extraction of a subset of data without having to load the entire file or even an array into Matlab. It is great for large datasets. 

Downwelling speeds in the deep water formation areas are likely not significant when compared with the settling speeds of most sediment particles. While deep waters have clearly defined oxygen and nutrient characteristics, it does not seem likely that they can have a particular sedimentary character. The deep water circulation associated with the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), while not very intense (a few cm/s), can transport some of the finer sediment classes along with it. The main sedimentary signal is likely associated with calcium carbonate. The shutdown of the MOC could have significant effects on the CaCO3 balance (Chikamoto et al., 2008). 

As per @Richard suggestion, I think the best answer comes from dune-pyla.com. They provide a complete explanation of the evolution of the dune and a couple of great summary figures: 

The color of the ocean water does indeed vary depending on the chemical composition of the water. In addition, the color of the ocean in satellite images is affected by the position of the satellite, angel of the sun, and weather. Color of water in general Water appears blue because long wavelengths (red or yellow light) are absorbed more efficiently in water than short (blue or green) wavelengths. Therefore, when a water body — in a swimming pool, for example — is illuminated by a white light source (the sun) the light that scatters back from the water tends to be blue rather than red. The color of the water can further be altered by its chemical composition. In nature, the apparent color of water also depends on the light source, that is, the weather. The same ocean can appear very different in bright sunlight and on a cloudy, stormy day. Color depends on substances in the water The color of the ocean water can be greatly altered by substances dissolved or suspended in the water. Typical substances that affect the color are chlorophyll (from waterborne algae) that make water appear green, or suspended particulate matter, such as silts and clay, that cause yellow or brown color. These are clearly seen in coastal areas, where local plankton blooms can turn water bright green, or river plumes carrying a high concentration of suspended particulate matter can be clearly identified from their brown waters. Other substances can alter the color of water as well. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) related to decaying detritus, can turn water yellowish or green, for example. Water temperature and salinity themselves do not significantly affect the color of the water. The color of the ocean, therefore, does depend on the location. For example, waters in areas with high primary production tend to be more green. Color of oceans in satellite images In satellite images, the color of the ocean can be influenced by the relative angle of the sun and the satellite versus the ocean surface. The ocean can appear darker if the satellite is at an oblique angle with respect to the ocean surface and/or if the sun is shining from an acute angle. In the case of geostationary satellites, the ocean near the equator can therefore appear to be brighter than in the high latitudes. Moreover, the color of oceans may be affected by the surface roughness. Surface waves affect the way light is reflected and refracted in the surface and may cause the ocean to appear darker. Consequently, the color of oceans may vary greatly in satellite images due to the track of the satellite and local weather conditions. This is often visible in large composite images, made out of multiple satellite tracks, where the ocean may appear patchy with different colors.
