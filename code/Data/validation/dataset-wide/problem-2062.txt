Evaluate carefully the company culture before providing too candid of a feedback. In an ideal world , and company, smith's suggestion of being completely honest and hoping that your manager comes to their sense or that higher management will intervene can backfire. badly. The main red flag and where I would worry If I were you is that in a sane and productive work environment you would be able to provide some of that feedback to your manager during the year and it would likely be taken into account. "Hey boss, I would really be more productive if you [...] " Type of interactions. Now you are heading in a year end review with a laundry list of complaints that shouts : 'I hate my boss'. In my experience when your boss and boss's boss see this they will know for sure that the relation is mostly broken and the upper management will either side with you (quite unlikely) or with your boss (most likely). If you end up in a worst case scenario you will have your boss becoming even more difficult and with no support from the upper management. This sets you up for a speedy exit (ie as soon as they have a chance, or as soon as the manager will really decide that he had enough) I would suggest the following : try to focus on one (or two) points that you think can be big wins for you. Provide some actionable suggestions (instead of just a complaint) and include it in some other positive point in your year end review. Some managers might even appreciate a heads-up on the couple of criticisms/suggestions you are making in their review. Also if you intend to stay that will make further communications easier, and you might try to suggest improvements during the year by directly interacting with your manager during the year. Which should be the healthy way of dealing with those issues. If it's still not improving, brush up your CV and look for another position, after all around half of the people leave their job because of their manager (see for example this gallup study) Good luck ! 

Context: the technical development staff stands at 31 individuals, of which I am the ScrumMaster/Development manager responsible 3 cross functional teams of 5 people in each team. Over the last year the business has been turning over (averaged out) 4-5 developers per month, of which I am now one of them as I have given my weeks notice. From my understanding it is attributable to a mid level manager who joined just over a year ago. I've given notice because this individual is too difficult to work with. Staff prior to his arrival say that the company was different. No one post his arrival has stayed longer than six months. Some of the turnover is down to individuals resigning, like my self. Other situations are down to sackings because the developers didn't "deliver" the user stories acceptably. SideBar 1: User stories often are in the from of; New Product Database, 2 days work. What that actually translates to; Re-factoring the existing database, creating new relational structures and ETL-ing from old to new. Re-factor all sprocs and sql statements for applications and place into production. I sat in the meeting where it was decided to dismiss him (the DBA) for being obstructionist, argumentative, not capable of delivering (my first warning signal something was wrong - given I was defending his (the DBA's) position). SideBar 2: The Mid Level Manager is on the business side rather than technical. He has shown some very unsavoury behaviour sexist, racist, Anti-Semitic, physically manhandling people out of meetings: generally obnoxious. What amazes me is that this individual has a huge list of "reputations" on linkedin, gushing about his marvellous skills and great to work with. I would like to exit the company gracefully, but I face with an "ethical" conundrum on two levels. A competency based one as I view his managements skills to be exceptionally poor and then the one about his disgraceful behaviour in the modern workplace towards colleagues (peers and direct reports). I do not, in my last week, want to raise a grievance, but as this company is a highly respected British organisation, who prides itself on it even-handedness to its consumers. I feel that this is a very toxic environment and it should be brought to light. So given I have five working days to go (as of 8 April 13), How do I; 

I have been through that route and is definitely not easy. H1B -> H1B -> Green Card as other mentions is definitely the most common way. With all the caveats and limitations attached to that process. It is generally a long, painful and random process. A lot of employers are generally weary of going through the process as the H1B is not always granted despite best efforts. Also application starts in April (and because of quotas you would need to apply in April) for jobs starting in October. A lot of employers don't want to get involved into a 6+ months random administrative process without even counting interviewing effort probably starting well ahead of April. Your best chances are for highly skilled, highly specialized, not time sensitive roles. I would say time-wise that January-February would be the best time to interview. One side note: if the overall process works some employer might take advantage of you being tied to them for 5 years. So be sure that they are a great match for you. There are two other paths you can explore : 

Not having a degree, yet claiming you do is fraud. If you get caught, people might report you and eventually you can get arrested for it. It's quite a severe crime, don't think too lightly of it. 

I'm not sure whether these can be considered benefits or perks, but here are a few I came across multiple times, or are quite common (in Holland): All of the below, or a combination of (most of the time) 2 out of these 3: 

Assuming your relationship with both your boss and colleagues is good, you could go to your boss and suggest to do something together with the team. 

Given the fact you work alone on this project, do you really need to collaborate with colleagues? Meaning: do you need their expertise to give you advise, or do they have to provide you with actual components? If it's incidental, I highly doubt walking to their office would be a problem. If the communication is more frequent, you might want to think about setting up a messaging tool, such as Lync or Gitter. Gitter is more development focussed so it might fit better, but I think you're to answer that. As for people walking in, you could keep your door closed if you don't want people to blatantly walk in. If they have some manners, they would knock and ask if you got some spare time for them. Same would go for when you have your door opened, though keep in mind that people would come in quicker. Usually, when I go to someones office, I knock and wait in the doorpost, asking if they have time to help me out/look at my progress. If they say no, I'll say I come back later or send them an email. 

So my suggested path is apply for jobs for international video game studio (it could be somewhere else in Europe or in Canada (where skilled workers have a somewhat easier path to get a visa). It will give you a chance to develop an international experience and then potentially lead you to working in the US for that studio. 

I was recently contacted by a senior recruiter on Linkedin. She introduced herself and wrote "I am keen to introduce myself and ask your advice [...]" This person seem to have a lot of experience and we share a few mutual connections so I thought this could be an interesting conversation even if I am not looking for a position. Hence I agreed to take the call. She then replied : "Perfect my colleague (a very junior recruiter) will call you at 3pm" I am not so interested in talking to the standard junior recruiter and feel I should cancel the call. I think this can happen in many situations other than a recruiter and hopefuly this can help people in similar situations. My question is : How to handle this bait and switch situation ? Can I cancel the call ? Should I explain why to this person. Also welcome comments on how common this is, and if I am overreacting. Thanks.
