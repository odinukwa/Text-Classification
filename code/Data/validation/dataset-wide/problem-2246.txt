Yes, in college and professional football, the clock does not stop a play. If the clock runs down to 0 while a play is going on, the quarter is over when the play is done. In addition, if certain circumstances occur on the last play (such as specific penalties), the quarter will be extended by one more play. From the NCAA Football 2013 and 2014 Rules and Interpretations, Rule 3 (Periods, Time Factors and Substitutions), Section 2, Article 1 (Length of Periods and Intermissions): 

Yes, there are some venues where alcohol advertising is banned, and any team sponsored by an alcoholic beverage company changes its livery for those races. When Williams was sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, the team changed the branding on their car to Sea World Adventure Parks (owned by Anheuser-Busch) for non-alcohol venues. Alcohol advertising is currently banned in France and in many middle-east countries. This is a growing movement, and there is international pressure on Formula 1 to ban alcohol sponsorship globally. 

In the early days of basketball, the rules were still being refined. As time went on, it was decided that the penalty for committing fouls was too great. So Dr. Naismith changed the rules so that all field goals were worth 3 points, and three consecutive fouls awarded the other team one point. Not long after that, Dr. Naismith came up with the concept of the free throw. Instead of awarding points automatically to the other team, a fouled player would be given a chance to take a shot from a free throw line, and earn another field goal for his team. By 1896, the rules were refined again to standardize the free throw line at 15 feet, and set the free throw goal at 1 point and field goals at 2 points. Source: History of the Free Throw The three-point line has its own history. The American Basketball League, a shortlived professional league, began using it in 1961, but the league folded a year later. The American Basketball Association began using it as soon as the league started in 1967. The National Basketball Association did not begin using it, however, and when the ABA merged into the NBA in 1976, the three-point line went away for a few years. The NBA introduced it in 1979, and the NCAA followed in 1986, shortly followed by high school basketball. Source: History of the 3-Pointer 

Different host cities have found different solutions for the Olympic Village. Often new buildings are constructed, some intended as temporary buildings, others with plans for use after the games. For some games, the organizers have chosen to utilize existing buildings (for example, university student housing) rather than build new buildings. Since the massacre at the 1972 Munich Games, security at the Olympic Village has been very tight. Only athletes, trainers, officials, and guests with credentials are allowed in; the media is barred from the Village. For many of the athletes, this is seen as another advantage to staying at the Village. Some of the bigger name athletes in recent times have chosen not to stay in the Olympic Village, choosing instead to make their own housing arrangements. John Stockton, who played in the 1992 American men's basketball team (the Dream Team), in choosing not to stay in the Village, said, "We don't intend to make a whole lot of friends here. The Olympic spirit is beating people, not living with them." For the Sochi 2014 Olympics, three different Olympic Villages have been constructed: the Coastal Olympic Village, for athletes competing in events at the Olympic Park; the Mountain Olympic Village, for alpine skiing and track events; and Endurance Village for cross-country skiing and the biathlon.

After a player bounces the ball, the ball is still live, meaning that any player could theoretically grab the ball and continue playing. So if the ball goes in the basket, the goal would count. Kicking the ball in, even if it is easier for you, is not allowed (NCAA Rule 9, Section 7; NBA Rule 10, Section 4). 

This rule concerns how the teams are ranked after the Group Stage (Round of 32) is done, determining which teams move on to the Round of 16. In each group, there are four teams. During the Group Stage, each team plays the other three teams in their group. For these three matches, each team is awarded 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. After the Group Stage is over, the four teams in each group are ranked according to how many points they accumulated over the three matches. (This is criteria A in the rule you cited.) If there is a tie after this ranking, criteria B and C are used, using the statistics from ALL three group matches that each team played in determining the rank order. If there is still a tie after criteria C is applied, criteria D, E, and F are used. The difference between these three criteria and criteria A, B, and C is that with D, E, and F, the only match(es) you look at is the match between the teams that are still tied. After the ranking in each group is figured out, the top two teams in each group move on to the Round of 16. 

Sarah Thomas is on Referee Jeff Triplette's crew. (Official source, Alternate source) Official crews do not travel with an alternate official. If one official has to leave the game, the crew shifts from 7-Man Officiating Mechanics to 6-Man Mechanics, essentially combining the Back Judge and Side Judge positions. There is also a 5-Man Mechanics protocol, if need be. Any less than that, and I would guess that they'd have to call the game off. According to the Football Zebras blog, Sarah Thomas returned later in the game. 

In the tie breaker, Devvarman has 195 points, and Falla has 155 points, so Devvarman is currently ranked ahead of Falla. 

If a player skips the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals without a valid excuse, they are no longer considered in good standing. 1.09 A: 

A pin is only considered fallen when it is knocked down or knocked off the lane surface. In the case you mentioned, where the pin slid but did not fall during your second ball, the pin would be considered left standing, and it would not be a spare. If this had happened during your first ball, the pin needs to be left where it was, and if the pinsetter knocked the pin down afterward, the pin would need to be replaced at its original position. From the United States Bowling Congress Playing Rules, Rule 6a (Pinfall, Legal Pinfall): 

For example, at the Rotterdam tournament (32S/16Q/16D/4Q), there were 32 participants in the singles main draw and 16 teams in the doubles tournament. There are different ways to get into the main draw. Some of the participants are direct acceptances, which means that their ATP or WTA rankings are high enough to get into the main draw directly. Others are wild cards; the tournament organizers have a few spots that they can award to anyone they want. Finally, some spots in the main draws are for qualifiers; these are players who finished at the top of a qualifying tournament that happens before the main tournament. If there is a qualifying tournament for a category, the draw size of the qualifying tournament is listed as "Q" after the main draw size. In the examples you mentioned:
