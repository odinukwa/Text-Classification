I think the best option is just to make sure that it is your friend who actually writes the CV, not you. That way you don't need any form of disclaimer. He or she will need to be able to explain anything and everything on that CV to a potential employer, so needs to understand it. In an interview there would be few things worse than blank look response to a "What did you mean by ..." question. If there are problems with the grammar or spelling, explain what the problems are and how to fix them, but make sure your friend actually fixes them. Encourage him or her to ask questions and talk to them about what Employers in your area like and dislike, what they expect and what they abhor. It will be frustrating, time consuming and could strain your relationship, but it could also end up strengthening your friendship immensely and will almost certainly help them to improve their English language skills. 

Suggested edits for additional biases gratefully accepted Ideally, candidates would not even include some of these items on their resume, but different cultures have different ideas of what should be on a CV, and this can work against individuals best interests. The best way to remove your own biases however would be to learn about the sources of bias and critically assess your own decisions. As a cis white male, I have to be particularly sensitive to any biasses I have with regards gender, race and sexuality. As someone from a working class background, I have to be careful of biasses with respect to wealthy or posh people. As a 'plate glass' university graduate, I have to be careful of bias against both polytechnic graduates and Oxbridge graduates. Understand your biases, learn about the issues surrounding them and attempt to eliminate them. There is little more you can do, but the fact that you are asking yourself these questions bodes well. 

My first job after university was for a defence contractor. I moved on after a few years because even though I was working on defence systems rather than offence systems, I decided that it conflicted too much with my moral stance. This side of things is a personal decision that only you can answer. When I moved into the commercial sector, there was little difference. Work I did was covered under Non disclosure agreements rather than under The Official Secrets Act but the onus on me was still to keep the confidences of my employer with regard to my work. In either environment I could talk about how I was treated, complain about tight schedules, and bemoan (in non specific terms) customers changing their specifications all of the time, and in neither environment could I talk about who my customer was or what I was helping to build for them. Anywhere with serious security concerns will have specific policies to address those concerns. Whether you are working on missile guidance systems or anti-virus software, there may be some networks with no connection to the Internet. You may even have to work inside a TEMPEST hardened vault, where you are searched for phones/memory sticks before you are allowed entry. In a commercial environment though, you could easily be stuck in a back room or basement with no natural light and a proxy server set up by a BOFH. Alternatively, you may just have a desk with a multiple computers, and an air-gap between them, so all you have to do to switch from a secure network computer to internet capable computer is to swing from one keyboard to another. Sure, you lose being able to copy/paste between them (compared to using a VPN to access a more secure network) but it doesn't impact on productivity that much. Ultimately, a security vetted job is not really any different to any other job, it's just that the priorities and consequences can be rather different. If you don't think you can cope with it ethically, steer clear, otherwise keep your nose clean and you could get to work on some interesting and unique projects. 

Why not do both? Choose something you are passionate about and find a way to make that relevant to your working environment. For instance, if you have a hobby of improvisational acting, be passionate about shows you have put on but also include a mention of how this skill helped you create user stories by acting out the role of your customer. If you have a hobby of playing board games, you could include a slide on how skills related to analysing game tactics have helped with problem solving at work. Exercises like this are to help interviewers understand your approach to life as well as see your presentation skills in action. 

We all work in our own way. We also tend to pick up on anything about people around us which is different. For myself, I go through cycles. My desk gets messier and messier as time goes on, right up to the point where there are too many things on my desk to easily find the immediate reference material I need. At this point I have a tidy up and file everything properly. I then have a clear desk for a few days until I start needing that reference material again, at which point it starts being pulled out of my files to populate my desk once more. So, depending of when it is in the cycle, I could look like I'm exceptionally tidy, tremendously messy or anything in-between. With regard to your co-workers perceptions of your tidiness, you are almost certainly taking this more seriously than they are. If it bothers you, you could always talk to them about it. It could be that their humour stems from the fact that they are jealous of how you manage to work in a paperless way, and would actually be interested to learn how you manage it. Finally, on the matter of printing things out. Many of us find reading documentation on screen hard on the eyes and e-paper e-readers simply aren't fast enough to update to be able to quickly flick through documentation. For many of us, dead-tree technology is far superior for some activities. 

There are essentially two problems here, trust and sociability. Social interactions There is little you can do about your co-workers talking amongst themselves about non work related things in a language you don't understand. Many people would consider it rude, but obviously your co-workers don't. You could try explaining how isolated they are making you feel, but their is no guarantee that will do any good. From your description though, I think that some people would consider your situation to be a Hostile work environment but taking any formal steps in that direction risks further alienating you from the group. Getting them to include you in non work conversations is going to be difficult until they accept you as part of their social group, but that is far beyond the scope of a Workplace answer (books have been written on the subject). From a different point of view though, I actually find it much easier to ignore people speaking a language I don't understand. When I just want to get on with work, I'm not interested in people nattering about the latest episode of some TV show or the Cricket results, so I'm happy to be left out of such conversations. Work interactions When you work in an environment where people speak languages you don't, you have to trust that they will speak to you about things which impact on your work. If you are not being kept in the loop about issues which affect your performance, and you can't persuade them otherwise, then this is probably a problem that only your manager can deal with. If your co-workers refuse to communicate with you effectively, then it is probably not an issue that you fix by yourself. One thing to do is to keep an ear open for words which have not been or cannot be translated. As a mono-linguist in a technical field who has worked all over the world, I can often tell what people are talking about things I might be interested in by the technical terms alone (LASER, programming language keywords, SI units and part codes etc.). Then it is simply a matter of checking "Excuse me, are you talking about X, is this relevant to my work?". Often this will cause the conversation to switch to English. If you can identify when they are talking about things you need to be included in, then you can encourage them to bring you into those conversations. Often people switch back to their native tongue when communicating is too difficult or slow in a secondary language. I have often had to sit listening to people having a heated argument in a language I didn't understand, with only an occasional update from one side or the other. This is not a problem, as long as eventually you get all of the information you need. Conclusion This is a difficult situation, but if you can find a way to involve yourself in their social interactions, this may help all of your interactions with your co-workers. More importantly you can try to learn how to identify when they are talking about things relevant to you, even if you don't understand precisely what they are talking about. The more conversations you need to be involved it, the more likely it is that they will default to your common language(s). Finally, if you find that you really cannot get on with your team, and still don't want to take it to your manager, continue building better relationships with other teams, you may be able to make move into one of those teams instead. 

There should be no embarrassment about asking a colleague or even a boss to correct a spelling mistake. We are all human and we all make mistakes. Wrap it up with a note of thanks for producing a nice reference letter and it doesn't have to be a big deal. Letting it slide however could be a problem. If it is likely that any reader of the letter would notice the spelling error then it could put the opinion of your boss in doubt. Similarly if the reader of the letter knows that you have read the letter (because you forwarded it to them) then it could reflect badly on you for not getting it corrected. So, in summary, ask your old boss for the mistake to be corrected, but do it tactfully. 

I have been in your situation several times in the past. I wanted or needed to move on, but I didn't want to let down or disappoint my former employers, so I ended up working for both for a time. The first time this happened, the agreement was between my old and new employers. I was sub-contracted back to my old company for a short period of time to assist with the hand over, and to perform some end of line work. In this case my new company was very happy that I had effectively brought a paying contract with me (and could thus start bringing in money immediately), and the old company was happy that they didn't have the expense of training up someone for a dead end project. Personally though, it wasn't ideal. I got to move on, but while the new company made plenty of money, I didn't see a penny of it. Since then, I have always ensured that my employment contracts have no provisions which prevent me from dong freelance work. This means that I can arrange my own private contracts to help support former employers in my own time. I've done this several times, and though it can be stressful and cause long work hours, it doesn't last for long and at least it can be quite financially rewarding. So, I would recommend that you,
