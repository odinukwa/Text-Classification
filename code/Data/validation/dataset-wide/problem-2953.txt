In my original I have 人 instead of 王 in chapter 25, so I read "people is also great" instead of "the (sage) king is also great". The original here also uses 人, though all three translations there translate 王 (the "representative of Heaven and Earth" -- Heaven is the top row, Earth the bottom row, and their representative, the middle row, connects top and bottom). Anyway, from Daoist general point of view, we humans are bound to the rules of Nature/Dao, just like any other species. Since we're not different, we don't deserve any "special treatment": DDJ 5 

Of course not all parts of thinking necessary to solve a mathematical puzzle are conscious. You may solve the main trick in your dreams, and elaborate the complete answer when you awake. That's very common, actually. Anyway we can measure thinking, conscious and unconscious, at least in theory, because the brain is a kind of muscle, actually. If you study the evolution of invertebrate animals, you'll see that the same cells worked as skin, muscles and neurons (in Porifera and Cnidaria, for instance). When you do a EEG, you are registering electrical activity in the brain. It consumes energy in the form of "ATP" (and CTP, GTP, TTP...) that came from glucose. All this, in biochemistry, is measured in J/g, cal/g, cal/mol, or similar physical quantities. So, the path is ready for your entreprise. But it would be very complex to achieve the sort of measure you plan (?) to do. 

Your point (2): is any god a "thing"? Because no religious person is worried with the question "where did God/some god came from?" For them, the gods may have always existed. Is the Universe a "thing" in the same sense as us? If the gods may have always existed, why can't the Universe? 

Sorry for my ignorance, but is Bhagavad Gita in your list? (I have read a probably-not-so-good, truncated translation only.) Let me first define the word "religion". I use it only for monotheisms, since they are so different from other mythologies. Only monotheisms are in a desperate urge to define themselves as NOT mythologies. In the polytheistic Amazon I saw people describing their way of thinking as mythologic, in the sense of gathering information and analyzing it at each generation. (If the lack of writing made them better at this, I don't know, but it's a question adressed by John Gray in Straw Dogs.) So, do you think the Bhagavad Gita qualifies more as philosophy/mythology or more as religion, in a western, dogmatic style? How it is seen today, after a long english colonization, and how it was seen before? And may I ask what have you read from chinese ancient philosophy too? 

The dialetheist wants A to mean "A is true," and ¬A to mean "A is false." But the dialetheist thinks some statements are both true and false. "This statement is false" is both true and false; the Russell set contains and doesn't contain itself. It's not that the Russell set sort of contains and sort of doesn't contain itself; it completely, 100% contains itself, and completely, 100% doesn't contain itself. Usually the dialetheist doesn't think that this happens in any "ordinary" situations. In particular, if A is provable in classical set theory (ZFC or whatever), the dialetheist usually wants it to be true that their system doesn't prove ¬A. So while we think it's OK if our axiom system proves that the Russell set contains and doesn't contain itself, we don't think it's OK if our axiom system proves that 2+2=3. It's only in self-referential contexts, and other contexts that only arise when you build an inconsistent set theory or a theory with full truth predicates, that we get paradoxes. Ordinary math is business as usual, or at least it's supposed to be. OK, but I still haven't even slightly addressed the central thrust of your question. What does it mean, on an intuitive level, to say that the Russell set contains and doesn't contain itself? Having spent the last year researching inconsistent mathematics, I can say that I still don't have any serious intuition that I can convey in words about that. I am sincerely sorry. I can, however, explain how I (myself, personally) arrived at the intuition that some things are both true and false. In what follows I do not speak for other dialetheists. In reading mystical literature (Hindu literature, the poetry of Aleister Crowley, etc.) I came across the idea of nondualism. Merriam-Webster defines it nicely: "A doctrine of classic Brahmanism holding that the essential unity of all is real whereas duality and plurality are phenomenal illusion and that matter is materialized energy which in turn is the temporal manifestation of an incorporeal spiritual eternal essence constituting the innermost self of all things." Some of my spiritual experiences convinced me that nondualism was true. Nondualism says that all is one --- everything is the same. It follows that a table is a chair, a hat is a handbasket, etc. It follows, in essence, that every statement is true and false. I would be willing to say that nondualism is the assertion that everything is true and false. (I realize this doesn't appear consistent with the Merriam-Webster definition; but that is the sort of difficulty one runs into in studying nondualism. Every definition is inadequate and wrong.) I wanted some math to back up the idea of nondualism. Of course it's easy and perfectly valid to build an axiom system where everything is true and false, but that's not very interesting from a mathematical standpoint, nor is it much of a talking point in arguments. It is somehow much more convincing to build an axiom system that agrees with everything we already believe, but also includes paradoxes. This sort of provides a "way in," where it becomes apparent that the idea of logical contradictions might not be irrational. So that's how I (myself, personally) got to dialetheism. If you are truly to determined to get an intuition about what it might mean for a paradox to be true, I might suggest meditating on it, and having a spiritual experience. Anyway that's what works for me. Best of luck, and thank you for reading! 

Dogs of grass, or straw dogs, were small decorative objects specially made for a ritual celebrating life, and destroyed after the ritual. Just like we are born, live, and are finally destroyed in the end. Considering also that our own instincts are usually enough for a good life, the Daoist mindset puts us closer to the other animals than the Western monotheisms: DDJ 57 

Dao De Jing 42. Nietzsche, in the so-called West, needed Darwin to understand the world without the monotheistic mythology. In a first moment he seems to grasp the natural evolution of everything. Later in life, half crazy (for not finding too many "thinking people"?), half misinterpreted (purposedly?) by so-called "postmodernists" mostly, ends up (kind of?) denying everything, including scientific knowledge. Or at least this is the interpretation lots of teachers and students made of his later writings. 

I was looking for a sentence in the last part of Nietzsche's The Antichrist (a part called "Law against Christianity"), which comes after the chapter 62. To my surprise, the vast majority of "full-texts" I found on the Web lack that last part! For instance: Project Gutenberg EBook Project Gutenberg EBook @ archive.org H.L. Mencken translation @ The American Mercury The University of Adelaide Library Walter Kaufmann translation @ Dave's Fringe Nietzsche's Features @ holtof.com Lexido (The Full and Free Nietzsche Portal) (there's nothing on Next Section after chapter 62) German version by University of Toronto German version @ bare-jesus.net Only a few versions have the last part: Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy @ abundanthope.org Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy @ shadowsgovernment.com German version @ archive.org Of course some of these versions stem from the same one. The question is: why the vast majority don't show the last part? Didn't it appear in the first edition, or in a later edition? Was it supressed by someone ideologically biased (maybe his sister)? All this together? Wikipedia says it's been supressed, but lacks references. 

The "primitive simplicity" is considered an ideal not impossible to achieve even nowadays, opposed to that Adam and Eve had "before the fall" in the "Garden of Eden". 

There is no "or". Can it be studied by philosophy? There it is a philosophical term. Can it be studied by political sciences? There it is a political term. Looks like it is both. 

The vast majority of texts I've read (probably all of them) link postmodernism with the Left-wing in politics. However, postmodernism attacks modern science, which was/is the main force against conservative monotheistic organized religion; postmodernism promotes individuality ("each one has its own truth"), undermining the idea of "Unity makes strength", a Left motto; postmodernist texts are - as a rule - very hard to understand, thus elitist, the very opposite of Left classics, such as Bertolt Brecht or Noam Chomsky. What are the published philosophers who wrote that postmodernism is a Right-wing philosophy? 

You might want to look into Husserl's Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. He explicitly states the problem in Sections 52-54, and calls it "the paradox of human subjectivity." However, you should be aware that his explication would make more sense if you have read the whole work. In general, his solution to this problem seems to me to be the underlying thesis of the whole work and one of the primary positive points of theory in his phenomenology. Merleau-Ponty takes up parallel themes in his Phenomenology of Perception. In general, the phenomenologists would be good references for this sort of thing. EDIT: I should also mention that Husserl's development of the issue is in more ontological terms than your naturalistic formulation. For him, there is a constitutive connection between consciousness and reason. Consciousness constitutes the world through meaning, and meaningful structures are limited by rationality. Husserl is also distinctly not a mind-body dualist. So the contours of the problem are going to be different, but I see the same basic difficulty here, i.e., the thrust of the question remains: how can it be that a part of the world (consciousness) constitutes the whole world? 

The sentence is not a huge problem to treat logically, but it does require a stipulated way of treating indexicals to ensure that it will behave logically the way it seems it should (to be true whenever uttered, yet contingently so). So, contrary to what others have said, it is a sentence that holds some interest in logic as a paradigm of an indexical sentence whose propositional content varies across circumstances and yet remains true whenever uttered. For example, Kaplan's influential treatment of indexicals and demonstratives is known as a "two-dimensional" account of indexicals. On such an account, you can guarantee that the sentence "I am here now" will come out true, while still preserving within your logical representation of the proposition expressed the sense of contingency and the structure of that contingency. More generally, I would offer, looking at the logical properties of such a sentence can teach us about how indexicals work in the language, and, depending upon your view of the relation between semantics and ontology, may even hold metaphysical lessons (of course this would require argumentation). You might look at the following SEP articles to dig deeper into the study of indexicals and two-dimensional treatment of them if that interests you: $URL$ $URL$ 

THe program of Universal Logic is mostly considered a joke by the professional logicians I have talked to. There seem to be two popular conceptions of logic among philosophers who think about logic. But before going into these, you have to understand first that, among present-day logicians, the philosophical concerns are most frequently secondary or tertiary if they are even taken into consideration at all. Today mathematical logic has taken on a life of its own and has merged for many with computer science in particular ways. It is, in general, a branch of mathematics. Thus, for a good majority of logicians, engaging in the study of the properties of a non-classical logic is frequently done for its own sake, not much different from studying the properties of any mathematical structure. It's also frequently done in view of computer science. The point here being that much logic done today is not motivated primarily by philosophical concerns, and rarely will you see logicians even engaging in the kinds of arguments you are talking about. But among philosophical logicians and philosophers who think about logic, there seem to be two streams of thought. First, there seems to be the view that logic can form the structural core of a metaphysics. This view is that of Williamson and his followers in his Modal Logic as Metaphysics. It is in this sense that there could be a correct logic for propositions that you are looking for. But today I think you'll have trouble finding anyone who thinks classical logic forms the core of a metaphysics, since modal metaphysics is in. So it's usually modal logics dealing with necessity that are taken to be a structural core of a metaphysics, since they can deal with dependence and grounding structures in a way that non-intensional classical logics cannot. The other guiding conception of logic that has emerged with the dominance of mathematical logic is logic as a tool, either in the sense of an organon or in the sense of an intellectual tool-kit. On this conception of logic is the device by which philosophers start from premises and draw conclusions. In the sense of organon, then, logic prepares the way for science by providing the device by which one may generate new conclusions from premises. With the proliferation of non-classical logics, many take a quite pluralistic approach. Any logical system has paradigm cases and problem cases. With a pluralistic conception, one simply uses whichever logical system’s paradigm cases conform most closely to the matters at hand, be it a classical or non-classical mathematical logic, a dialectical or Hegelian logic, or something else. Personally the last time I have seen arguments regarding the "correct" logic in the sense you are discussing is back in the Quine-Montague days. Quine's arguments were quite frequently motivated by a concern with preserving the classical meanings of the first-order logical terms, which indicates his endorsement of classical logic as the "correct" one. But these arguments are not really going on today, and certainly not among logicians.
