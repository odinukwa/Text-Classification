Recall that a hypersurface in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$ is defined to be minimal if its mean curvature vanishes, where its mean curvature is simply the sum of the principal curvatures (sometimes divided by $n$). Equivalently, the hypersurface is a critical point for the $n$-volume with respect to compactly supported variations. The equation above is the condition that the mean curvature of the graph of $f$ vanishes everywhere. Part of the importance of the Bernstein problem is that it has a direct bearing on the existence of minimal cones and singularities of minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$. The answer to the problem was proved to be affirmative in the cases $n=3$ by de Giorgi (1965), $n=4$ by Almgren (1966), and $n\leq7$ by Simons (1968), and apparently there was some hope to extend the result to all dimensions. However, in 1969 Bombieri, de Giorgi and Giusti constructed a counter-example for $n=8$, which yields a counter-example in each dimension $n>8$ by a standard construction, closing the problem. The complete solution of the Bernstein problem turned out to involve a good deal of geometric measure theory and non-linear analysis. 

The Monster group is a finite simple group of order approx. $8\cdot 10^{53}$ whose existence was predicted by Fischer and Griess in about 1973. An explicit construction of a representation of dimension 196882 over $\mathbf Z_2$ was obtained by Robert Wilson with the aid of a computer (published in 1998); see Wikipedia article $URL$ 

In complex analysis of one variable, Liouville's theorem says that a bounded entire function is constant. Bernstein (1915-17) proved an analogous result in differential geometry, namely, if the graph of a function $f:\mathbf R^2\to\mathbf R$ of class $C^2$ is a minimal surface in $\mathbf R^3$, then the graph a plane. He then posed the classical Bernstein problem, namely, whether the same result also holds for real functions of $n>2$ variables. In terms of differential equations: 

(Note that $A$ itself lies in this normal space, so the affine normal space coincides with the normal space). In fact, this is clear if $A$ is a diagonal matrix, since in that case the centralizer of $A$ consists of the subspace $\Sigma$ of all diagonal matrices, and $\Sigma$ is also the normal space $N_A(G\cdot A)$ as is easily checked. For a general regular matrix $A$, there exists $g\in O(n)$ such that $gA\in\Sigma$ and then $g^{-1}\Sigma$ is both the co-diagonalizability class of $A$ and the normal space $N_A(G\cdot A)$. Suppose $A\in V$ is regular. Since $N_A(G\cdot A)$ is an equivalence class, it follows that for all regular $B\in N_A(G\cdot A)$ we also have $N_B(G\cdot B)=N_A(G\cdot A)$. In other words: 

If $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ with Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ and thus with the (affine) formula $y^{m}= (x_{1}-a_{1})^{t_{1}}....(x_{n}-a_{n})^{t_{n}}$ there is a Galois group decomposition on the cohomolgy $H^{1}(C, \mathbb{C})$ (or more generally on the sheaf $R^{1} \pi_{*} \mathbb{C}$ ) and the dimension of the eigenspace with respect to the character $j \in \mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ is given by the formula $-1+ \sum_{i=1}^n < jt_{i}/m> $ (where $< x>$ denotes the franctional part of the number $x$ ) . Now if the Galois group of the covering $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is not cyclic, is there a formula that computes the dimension of the eigenspaces? Or generally how can one compute the dimension of the eigenspaces? For simplicity you can always assume that the covering $\pi$ is abelian (i.e. the Galois group is abelian) and thereof the fiber product of cyclic covers. 

This must be an easy question but I don't have a good argument for it and have not found a counterexample: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$ such that the center of $G$, $Z(G)$ is trivial, i.e. $Z(G)=\{1\}$ is it true that the center of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$, denoted $Z(G_{\mathbb{R}})$ is also trivial? 

Let $X$ be a compact Shimura curve. If we remove finitely many points from this curve, do we neccessarily get a "non-compact Shimura curve"? I have some reasons to believe that the answer is negative, but don't have a proof nor a counter example. However if the answer is really No, does there exist a well-known structure / property for this punctured Shimura curve? 

I asked this question already in mathstackexchange but got no answer, so I ask it again here. Let $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ be the Siegel upper half space, i.e., the set of complex symmetric $g\times g$ matrices with positive-definite imaginary part. Royden in his article "inavariant metrics on Teichmüller space" gives the inifinitesimal form of the Kobayashi distance (metric) on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ as the operator norm $\frac{1}{2}||Y^{-1/2} dZ Y^{-1/2}||$. My question is what is the Kobayashi distance between two given points on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$? For example, when $g=1$, (i.e., $\mathbb{H}_{g}=\mathbb{H}_{1}$ is the upper half plane) it is well-konwn that the Kobayashi distance (finite version of the Kobayashi metric given above) between $z$ and $w$ in $\mathbb{H}$ is the usual hyperbolic distance $d_{\mathbb{H}}(z,w)$. What is the generalization of this to the upper half space? 

Note that this a $4$-dimensonal solvable Lie algebra and $a$, $a^\dagger$, $1$ span an ideal isomorphic to the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg algebra. So one realization is obtained by taking $$ a=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&1&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{array}\right),\quad a^\dagger=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&0&0\\0&0&1\\0&0&0\end{array}\right),\quad 1=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&0&1\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{array}\right). $$ Now the adjoint action of $H$ on this ideal has this matrices as eigenvectors with respective eigenvalues $1$, $-1$, $0$, so we finish by taking $$ H=\frac12\left(\begin{array}{ccc}1&0&0\\0&-1&0\\0&0&1\end{array}\right). $$ We can also realize the elements of this Lie algebra as vector fields on $\mathbb R^4$. Namely, we modify the standard realization of the Heisenberg algebra as vector fields on $\mathbb R^3$ (with coordinates $(x,y,z)$) by adding a fourth coordinate $w$: $$ a = e^w\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-\frac y2\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right),\quad a^\dagger = e^{-w}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\frac x2\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right),\quad 1=\frac{\partial}{\partial z},\quad H=\frac{\partial}{\partial w}.$$ 

I think the definitive work on that has been done by Hector Sussmann (Orbits of families of vector fields and integrability of distributions. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 180 (1973), 171–188, freely available here). Let $D$ be a smooth subbundle of $TM$ and $G$ the pseudo-group of local diffeomorphims generated by the flows of smooth sections of $D$. Sussmann proved there is a smallest $G$-invariant smooth distribution $\bar D$ containing $D$, which moreover is involutive and admits maximal integral manifolds through any point. It is important to note that the dimension of $\bar D_x$ will not be constant for $x\in M$. We have $\bar D=D$ if and only if $D$ is $G$-invariant. Sussmann paper indeed studies a more general situation, appropriate for control theory, and contains many more very interesting results about the complete integrability of distributions. In fact I would recommend it as a "classic". 

Motivation: If true, it would imply that the all invariants of $V\oplus V^*$ as a representation of $\mathbb C^\times\times E_6$ would be pull-backs of coadjoint invariants under the moment map. Some details: The roots of $E_6$ are (we use Bourbaki conventions) $$ \pm\epsilon_i\pm\epsilon_j\quad1\leq i<j\leq5\quad\mbox{(for $Spin(10)$)} $$ and $$ \frac12(\epsilon_8-\epsilon_7-\epsilon_6+\sum_{i=1}^5\nu_i\epsilon_i)\quad\Pi_{i=1}^5\nu_i=1\quad\mbox{(for the half-spin representation)}. $$ The $27$-dimensional irreducible representation $V$ of $E_6$ and its contragredient $V^*$ have respectively highest weights $$\lambda_1 = \frac23\Omega\quad\mbox{and}\quad\lambda_6=\frac13\Omega+\epsilon_5 $$ where $\Omega=\epsilon_8-\epsilon_7-\epsilon_6$. These are minuscule weights, which means that the Weyl group $W$ acts transitively on the weights of $V$ (resp. $V^*$); in particular they all have multiplicity one. The weights of $V$ can be listed as $$ \frac23\Omega,\ \frac16\Omega-\frac12\sum_{i=1}^5\nu_i\epsilon_i\ (\Pi_{i=1}^5\nu_i=1), -\frac13\Omega\pm\epsilon_i\ (1\leq i\leq5).$$ In particular, $$ \lambda_1,\ -\lambda_6,\ -\lambda_1+\lambda_6 $$ are weights of $V$; the longest element in $W$ maps the highest weight $\lambda_1$ and the lowest weight $-\lambda_6$ one to the other and thus fixes $-\lambda_1+\lambda_6$. One can indeed find elements in $W$ permuting $\lambda_1$, $-\lambda_6$, $-\lambda_1+\lambda_6$. The angle between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_6$ is $60^o$. Now it is not difficult to see that $\Gamma$ is the Coxeter group of type $A_2$. Edit: Here is a naive argument which appears to give an answer. Suppose $w\xi_1=\xi_2$ where $w\in W$ and $\xi_1$, $\xi_2\in\mathfrak a^*$. Since the action of $W$ preserves the real span $\mathfrak a^*_{\mathbb R}$ of $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$, we may assume $\xi_1$, $\xi_2\in\mathfrak a^*_{\mathbb R}$. Since $\Gamma$ is a subquotient of $W$ and the action of $\Gamma$ on $\mathfrak a^*$ is generated by reflections on the real lines through $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$, we may replace $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ by suitable $\Gamma$-conjugates and assume both are linear combinations of $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$ with non-negative coefficients. Now $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$ are fundamental weights of $E_6$, so this implies that $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$ belong to the positive Weyl chamber of $E_6$ and thus $w=1$. Update: The argument in the first edit seems OK, but about the above motivation, it is not true that it implies that the invariants are all pull-backs of coadjoint invariants. 

I am trying to understand the Segal-Sugawara construction from the book "vertex algebras and algebraic curves" by Frenkel, Ben-Zvi in 3.4.8. As an absolute layman in the area of mathematical physics and vertex algebras, I have difficulties to understand the arguments there, as it seems many details in the proof have been omitted. More concretely, the computations of $S_n.J^{b}_{-1}v_k$ for $n=-1,0,1$ are still obscure for me. Could anyone explain these computations with more details? 

If $f: X \rightarrow C$ is the universal family of false elliptic curves (i.e. abelian surfaces $A$ such that $End(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a totally indefinite quaternion algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$), then $C$ is a Shimura curve. My question is : How does the the variation of Hodge structures(VHS) of this universal family look like? Of course I know that for any family of abelian varieties over a Shimura curve, the VHS has the form $R^{1}f_{*}\mathbb{C}= (\mathbb{L} \otimes \mathbb{T}) \bigoplus \mathbb{U}$ where $\mathbb{U}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ are unitary and $\mathbb{L}$ is uniformizing, but I want a more specific description in the case of a universal family of false elliptic curves. 

In the literature, in many places the computations of Cohomology of the affine singular and projective smooth models are done interchangeably. Let us work with curves. For example, if $\pi:Y\to \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of the $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, then $Y$ is projective and smooth but in in practical cohomological computations the affine singular model $X$ defined by the equation $X:=\{y^l=\prod (x-a_k)^{d_k}\}$ is used. Of course $Y$ is the normalization of $X$ and I know that $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\cong H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$. But for example when the curve is defined over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$ and you compute the Hasse-Witt matrix $F:H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ how can one still use the basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ and computations be in terms of $a_k$ and $d_k$ above (which come from $X$)? The precise example that I have in mind is the following: (Taken from the paper I. Bouw, The p-rank of ramified covers of curves. Compositio Math. 126 (2001), 295–322.). The standard way of computing the above Hasse-Witt matrix is to decompose the cohomology $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ in to eigenspaces $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ of the natural $\mathbb{Z}/l \mathbb{Z}$-action for $1\leq i\leq l-1$. Then a basis for $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ is computed by taking two open sets $V_1=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \infty)$ and $V_2=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \{0\})$. Then $\Gamma(V_1,\mathcal{O}_{V_1})=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{l-1} k[x]v_i$ where $v_i=y^i \prod (x-a_k)^{-[id_k/l]}$. My problem/question is: $v_i$ is only a rational section (not regular) and on $X$ (not $Y$) so how can it be viewed as a regular section? If you pull it back to $Y$ to become a regular function, then first of all the equation of $v_i$ certainly changes and secondly, how come that the resulting matrix $F$ is still the same, although we are using a basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ (instead of $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$)? (Because if $F:V\to V$ and you change the basis, of course the matrix of $F$ changes too!) 

By passing to the double cover of $M$, we may assume that $M$ is orientable (compact of genus $n\geq2$); note that a Killing field on $M$ would lift to a Killing field on the double covering. A Riemannian metric together with an orientation defines an almost complex structure on $M$, simply by declaring that the complex structure on each tangent plane is rotation by ninety degrees, say, in the counter-clockwise sense. Since the dimension of $M$ is two, this structure is integrable, i.e. there is an atlas of complex charts on $M$ inducing it so that $M$ becomes a compact Riemann surface. A Killing field on $M$ would generate a continuous one-parameter group of isometries of $M$, and any isometry of $M$ (or, for that matter, a conformal transformation) is a holomorphic automorphism. However, a theorem of H. A. Schwarz states that the group of holomorphic automorphisms of a compact Riemann surface of genus $\geq2$ is finite. Hence there are no Killing fields on $M$. 

The property above means that the action of $G$ on $V$ is an example of a polar representation. Namely, an orthogonal representation of a compact Lie group $G$ on a (finite-dimensional) real vector space $V$ is called polar if there exists a subspace $\Sigma$ that meets all the orbits, and meets always orthogonally. I think now it is more natural to solve the question in the context of polar representations. Let $(G,V)$ be a polar representation. Fix a regular point $v_0\in V$ (in this context we may assume that a regular point is just one through which the orbit has maximal dimension). Then the normal space $\Sigma=N_{v_0}(Gv_0)$ is a section. The other sections are all of the form $g\Sigma$, for some $g\in G$. Two different sections can only meet at a singular point, so that the regular points of all possible sections foliate the set of regular points. We want a rational map $\Phi:V\to \mathbf R^p$ whose level sets are the sections. For regular $v\in V$, we study the intersection of the normal space $N_v(Gv)$ with the affine tangent space $v_0+T_{v_0}(Gv_0)$. Note that they have complementary dimensions in $V$. We claim that for $v$ lying in the complement of a proper real algebraic set of $V$, that intersection consists of a unique point, which we call $v_0+\Phi(v)$. This will define a rational map $\Phi:V\to T_{v_0}(Gv_0)\cong\mathbf R^p$, where $p$ is the dimension of maximal dimensional $G$-orbits. In fact, the linear system that defines $\Phi(v)$ is $\langle \Phi(v),X\cdot v\rangle = - \langle v_0,X\cdot v\rangle$ for $X\in\mathfrak g$. Let $X_1,\ldots,X_m$ be a basis of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ such that $X_{p+1},\ldots,X_m$ lies in the isotropy algebra at $v_0$. Then $\Phi(v)=\sum_{j=1}^px_jX_j\cdot v_0$ for some real numbers $x_1,\ldots,x_p$ depending on $v$, and the above system has the explicit form
