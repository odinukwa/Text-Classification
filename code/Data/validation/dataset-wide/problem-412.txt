If you read Soviet literature, e.g., science fiction from the decade following Stalin's death, it was full of hope. And it was genuine hope, not communist party propaganda. These hopes were eventually killed, suffocated perhaps is the better word, by the stagnation of the Brezhnev era. Instead of the stagnation, allow economic reforms in the 1960s in both the Soviet Union and its satellite states. Allow Hungary to go through with its 1968 New Economic Mechanism unimpeded. Reintroduce and strengthen the reforms of Lenin's New Economic Policy and insist on the satellite states following suit. Allow private enterprise, foreign investment, market forces and the free flow of capital. Tear down the stupid Berlin wall (or better yet, don't build it in the first place); a good economic policy is a much better way to retain manpower. In short, do what China did under Deng, and what the Soviet Union dared not do under Brezhnev, for fear of losing direct and complete control over the economy of the totalitarian state. With the human and economic resources available to the Soviet Union, it could have become an economic powerhouse by the 1980s, even as it maintained a one-party state and totalitarian control over the political sector. China's example shows as much. And the occasional political revolt could be put down with ease (see Tiananmen Square) when the people, by and large, are satisfied with your governance. The Prague Spring of 1968 might not even have happened. Solidarity would have been just a blip on the radar, if it even formed in the first place. Oh, and don't let Reagan bait you with Star Wars into a spending contest that you are destined to lose. And, of course it goes without saying, don't get suckered into the Afghanistan adventure. Don't waste the space program's resources on a shuttle just for prestige, when it was glaringly obvious already that the universal, economical "Space Transportation System" was anything but. But you know what... even with these rather bad political mistakes, the Soviet Union could have remained intact and more powerful than ever, if its septuagenarian leadership only had the courage to allow its economy to flourish. 

Putting armour directly on the wings probably won't be too plausible. They would weight them down, might limit their mobility, and would defiantly be exhausting. I'm imagining flying armour on your wings would be like climbing a rope with heavy weights on your wrists. While I think your character wouldn't want to engage in hand to hand at all (flying out of weapons range and dropping hazardous objects would be hard for an enemy to counter), there could be ways to protect their wings on the ground. What about a thick cape reinforced with chain mail netting? Sure, they couldn't fly with it on, but they could carry if in a sack and put it on when they land. If the wings can fold into a way convenient for fitting through doors, this might be enough to keep them safe in a melee. If the cape alone can't provide enough defense, what about a solid metal "shell" shield that's worn like a backpack? Just unbuckle the shell when you need to escape into the air! This post is inspired by whenever I put my coat over my backpack when walking in the rain. 

The shortest documented adult ever became only 54.6cm (21.5"). Even though this is quite small, I'd say it is definitely way too large to be able to fly with (butter)fly wings. I could rather imagine bird or bat wings. I also assume you cannot simply gain a human in a form as tiny as one wants to imagine as many of our organs probably have a limited minimum size to function properly. You'd have to change the internal body massively and throw out anything not absolutely necessary. Also they'd probably not as slim but rather have a stocky body and a quite oversized head. Retaining human intelligence with a brain a fraction of the size of ours is hardly possible. They may have a slightly improved efficiency but barely anywhere close to human intelligence. Also a more efficient brain would raise the demand of energy so they'd have to eat and sleep very much. In addition to the high energy demand for their flying ability I'd say that's a very limiting factor. As for your last question, that's a matter of supply and demand. Since human teeth are like ivory to them they create jewelry from, less people believing in fairies mean less teeth and thus higher value per tooth. The much more important question is: why would such a creature develop? Did they develop out of a hominid or an insect, and why would it shrink and develop full wings but not change anything else (or vice versa, why would it change its body into the human form)? The human body has specialized to living on the ground and it's obviously totally ineffective and useless if it was able to fly. 

Well, for starters, generating heat wouldn't result in any force being generated. In this set up, its not so much the heat or fire propelling your character as much as him continually making explosions. Think achieving flight by the recoil of firearms. Right off the bat, he would have to be capable of withstanding that kind of explosive force being generated right next to his body. Using explosive power has other issues for his surroundings. Generating that much force might damage this characters surroundings, but probably not too much more than a helicopter (I'm guessing that last bit. Aerodynamics is not something I know anything about). The real problem would be the noise. Having a character achieve flight by combustion would be louder than an un-muffled motorcycle and would be sure to wake the neighbors. No way he could be able to sneak up on anyone while flying. A simpler but less ideal solution is for him to heat (and cool down if possible) air in order to manufacture updrafts. Then he can make hang-gliders that never have to touch the ground or reverse-parachutes. It's very gadget-y, but would be plausible and make your character look cleaver.
