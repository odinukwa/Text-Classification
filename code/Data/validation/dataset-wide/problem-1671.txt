Just because we urinate phosphates, nitrates, and sulfates, doesn't mean we are "peeing liquefied mustard gas." 

According to La Tour Eiffel "Every evening, the Eiffel Tower is adorned with its golden covering and sparkles for 5 minutes every hour on the hour, while its beacon shines over Paris." 

There is one serial killer that did murder policemen - but there is no account of her playing 'cat and mouse':

Context During a Q&A Session at a Case Western Reserve University event, Judge John E Jones III gave an anecdote about Justice David H Souter giving a tour of the Supreme Court to a Russian Judge. In this particular story he was recollecting, Justice Souter said he believed the most important Supreme Court case was Brown vs. Board of Education. The Russian Judge disagreed and said it was United States vs. Nixon. Dilemma I can't find, with internet searches, that this exchange really happened. I am not, at all, questioning Judge John E Jones III, as he is simply re-telling a story that was told to him. Question Are there any reliable sources that can corroborate this account? 

Self-made, from the NOAA Global Surface Temperature Dataset, version 4.0.1. From Zhang, H.-M., B. Huang, J. Lawrimore, M. Menne, Thomas M. Smith, NOAA Global Surface Temperature Dataset (NOAAGlobalTemp), Version 4.0.1. doi:10.7289/V5FN144H, accessed 14 Aug, 2017. Data source: $URL$ The dataset used to produce the above graph enables a month-by-month comparison of the temperature anomalies for 2007 to 2017: 

Most likely. The Bakhshali manuscript (also from India, but written in Sanskrit rather than Hindi) predates Aryabhata by centuries. 

In fact, 2007 is only the tenth warmest year on record, tied with 2003 and 2006. January through April 2017 were each the second warmest months on record, with only the corresponding months in 2016 being warmer. May and June 2017 were the third warmest, beaten by 2016 and 2015. Given that the ENSO index is projected to remain positive but below the El Niño threshold, and given that July to December 2015 were extremely hot, this most likely puts 2017 on track to be the third warmest year on record, behind 2016 and 2015. 

This does not mean that a single 50 gram of processed meat increases your chance of colorectal cancer by 18%. That 50 grams is the average amount consumed per day over the course of years. That's three quarters of a pound of bacon every week of the year. That represents a significant risk of obesity as well as a slight increase in the risk of colorectal cancer. 

Many sources conclude that the FBI have documentation of MLK's adultery, and many sources conclude that he was an adulterer. All information comes from the FBI and filtered through Lyndon B. Johnson. Consider the atmosphere of the country - there was a civil rights movement taking place and J. Edgar Hoover was extremely fervor in his collection of data on everything ranging from Communists, Terrorists, and Activists. Former President Harry Truman stated: 

In simpler terms, obese people become deficient in Leptin, which is directly related to the responsiveness of T Cells. 

The article first extrapolates origins of the 5,000 number. Bjorn Lomborg's 2007 book, Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming." The book said, there were about 5,000. What was the footnote? "Krauss, 2006." Clifford Krauss, a reporter for The New York Times, who wrote on May 27, 2006, about the conflict between polar bear protectors and trophy hunters: "Other experts see a healthier population. They note that there are more than 20,000 polar bears roaming the Arctic, compared to as few as 5,000 40 years ago." But he couldn't recall his source. He just said that number is widley accepted. As we all know, Argumentum Ad Populum is a logical fallacy. 

We don't really know. Despite the claims of a population boom, there is no definitive evidence to know how many polar bears there were "to begin with." One can't scientifically determine an end result with a variable starting point. 

These numbers look legitimate. They are given per 100,000 (which is a standard practice, and often assumed by default). Both 1992 and 2011 numbers exactly match FBI report (and apparently were taken from there), and I don't see any reason to doubt them. Here is a summary for 1992 & 2011 from the report: 

It is very likely to be a fake. According to NKnews, The World Cup games are aired in North Korea by KCTV (although with delay and removed commentary), so it appears that there is no sense in faking news while the general population is aware of the developments at the World Cup, at least to some extent. Also, since the North Korea qualification games were aired, they do know that their team didn't qualify. 

According to Donald Menzel (he is the earliest source of this information I know of), the term "flying saucer" first was mentioned in '47 and the traditional shape followed on, although in reality most of these "objects" are not very saucer-like. Here is some write-up on this story I found here: 

Firstly, there is no proof that the video was taken in Krasnoarmiysk. The claim by Russian defence ministry is based on the alleged fact that the banner has an address printed on it: 

This story is described in Menzel's book "Flying Saucers", and he claims that there is no mention of such objects before that incident. Therefore, there is no sense in trying to explain the shape, as it was not caused by logic, but rather by pure accident of the craze starting with this term spread through media.

Urea vs. Urine Urea is a nitrogenous waste - but it isn't urine... yet. Urea's molecular formula is CH4N2O. It doesn't have the sulfates and phosphates that urine does. Urine is nitrogenous waste - but it has much other stuff. Human urine consists primarily of water, with organic solutes including1: 

In some simpler terms, increased sugar (glucose) increased T Cell (immune cells) response. That may put a whole new outlook on honey being used as a medical supplement. 

Pliable Wood + Elongated Shaft = Easily Bendable/Breakable Spear This video demonstrates step by step on how a Shaolin Monk breaks a spear. Look at how easily the shaft bends as he applies his weight to it. This is misleading as a deadly weapon, because if a spear did this during combat, it would be rendered useless very quickly. Listen closely to the 'hollow' sound of the wood hitting the ground in the video upon breakage. Dense wood, such as that of a real spear, does not sound this way. It doesn't stop with mere bendable spears. This video demonstrates a Shaolin Monk bending rebar with his neck as well. One key thing to realize isn't his many years of perfecting his mind and body in a temple - rather his hopping up and down to create a bending point for the rebar. Penn & Teller: Bullsh!t (Episode 109 / Self-Helpless) actually show quite well the breaking of an arrow, the bending of rebar, and even walking on hot coals - and how the average person can achieve this without needing to practice within a Shaolin Temple. The word of the day is Buckling. 

Strictly speaking, no. The monies appropriated by Congress are an act of law and are thus legal, by definition. However, these appropriations are supposed to be backed by authorizations, and a growing portion of the US federal government's discretionary spending is not backed by authorizations. From the Harvard Law School Federal Budget Policy Seminar paper "Authorizations and Appropriations: A Distinction Without Difference?" (emphasis mine), 

The rationale for creating this distinction between authorizations and appropriations was to separate politics (authorizations) from paying the bills (appropriations). The problem is that authorization bills often get bogged down by politics and languish. For example, authorization for the State Department got bogged down by arguments big and small for 15 years. The State Department had no authorization (but most certainly had budget) from 2002 to the end of 2016. The State Department is once again authorized to do its business, at least for a short while, with Senate Bill 1635. This was passed by both branches of Congress and signed into law in December, 2016. Whether the State Department will be reauthorized to exist next year is dubious. Appropriations will still be granted, even if it is not reauthorized. The State Department is but one part of the US federal government. This repeats many times over throughout the US federal government. 

One could ask the question, if local farmers vandalized rice research, why would they be regarded as the fastest adopters of said research? 

Most telling of all, is this "Qi Gong Master" bending 3 spears at one time (notice how he pushes the tips with his chin into his breast bone. 

Since blood plasma is the catalyst for saliva creation, our other cells do not have much use for nitrate - which is why dietary nitrate floats unused in our blood until we excrete it via urine. So yes, our saliva contains a component of urine - but one component of urine doesn't make it urine. 

No, assuming you mean Central Bank rather than specifically Federal Reserve. Lincoln and JFK actually had very little in the way of removing or even reducing the power of a Central Banking System. Let's examine Presidents (and one Founding Father) that had something to do with a Central/Federal Reserve Bank. 

There is inconclusive evidence. The Cochrane Review found there is inconclusive evidence to support whether or not electric fans may cause an adverse effect on one’s health1. Citation 1Electric fans for reducing adverse health impacts in heatwaves 

A healthy person, with no metabolic disorders (like obesity) could actually benefit from having sugar in their diet, because it would increase the reaction of their body's immune system. An unhealthy person, with a metabolic disorder (like obesity) would not benefit from having sugar in their diet, because it would decrease the reaction of their body's immune system. 

Above the logo, there are two words in capital letters "National autodealer". While it is very hard to say what's actually written on the street banner, the shape of things seem to match. No other evidence (i.e., the coordinates of the exact place where the video was taken) was presented. So, the claim that there is a discernible address on a banner is highly doubtful and there is no reason to believe it is in Krasnoarmiysk. Below follows some speculation, because of the lack of more credible sources. Secondly, there is some anecdotal evidence that the video was taken in Luhansk (fully under control of rebels), as supported by streetview: Looks like the same pole: 

No, it was flying its usual path, same as it was flying for months before the event. Here is the path of the same flight day before (a bit to the South): 

All in all, it is hard to say where the truth is, but it is certainly clear that the original claim is not supported by any reliable evidence and largely disputed. Even less can be said about the actual time when the video has been shot. 

The report didn't show how they managed to recover this address from the banner, and it seems like an explanation is due, as the image is very blurry. The banner itself seem to be identical to this one (which is spread as a part of their ad campaign): 

The following publications/organizations have reported that the Eiffel Tower has dimmed its lights in response to the terror attack (and this is not an all-inclusive list): 

Statements by the Biotechnology Information Center even identity who led the assault - Wilfredo Marbella. Wilfredo Marbella is a leader among the Kilusand Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, a "peasant movement of the Philippines" and wholeheartedly declare on their own website as "a democratic and militant movement." Additionally, they encourage mob tactics and even promote their destructive affairs online via social media. 

In other words, only the sparkling lights will turn off, at random, and the beacon lights turn off at a certain temperature, or when the sun is up. All the lights were dimmed, as a sign of mourning, for the victims of the terror attack 

Conclusion It is extremely plausible that MLK was indeed an adulterer, and that the FBI has evidence of such activity. The article mentioned below can help sum it all up best: The Hollywood Reporter article, "Selma and the Sex Tape Controversy," reveals: 

No, those weren't mere farmers - they were militants made up of farmers. According to the International Rice Research Institute: 

An excellent article, by Peter Dykstra, in the Summer 2008 edition of Society of Environmental Journalists starts documenting all of the unfounded claims:
