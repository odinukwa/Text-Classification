Make it part of the dress-code policy. I don't think wearing a lot of cologne or perfume is very professional. How much is too much? Hard to measure, but it shouldn't be highly noticable when shaking hands. Body odor would fall into this category as well. Your clients aren't going to want to smell it either. I don't think you can post it like some sort of no smoking policy. What do you do when a client walks in with too much purfume? Tell them to go outside? Another part of the management policy is to let this person with the hyper-sensitivy know he should continue to excuse himself when an area has an odor. There are polite and discrete ways to do this. 

It doesn't sound like you have any idea what expectations are being placed on your boss. Have some discussions about the "big picture" kind of stuff to know what is important to him. Maybe he has the ultimate decision, but usually there are at least client expectations that are involved as well. Usually, the people doing the actual work, have the best idea about how long it will take. Try getting your team involved in the requirements and expectations of the projects and then setting solid due dates based on working normal hours. Don't try to appease clients by giving them due dates that will make them seem happy only to fail to meet the deadlines. As far as I can tell, your boss either isn't aware of the time commitment your team is making to meet these deadlines or he doesn't care. It is up to you to try and get more involved in these decisions and stand up for your team. Let it be known they can't keep this pace up forever and there is a risk of losing good people. This is going to cause more missed deadlines in the future. Your job is to help your team to be successful. 

I don't think you're using the 5 months of experience to your advantage. Try to be more specific about what your capabilities are and what you've accomplished. Consider the following: 

I think you need to talk to some of the people in charge and find out how they perceive your roll in these discussions. Do you even get a "vote"? Are you there as a courtesy? Are you there to just answer questions as they see fit; otherwise, they expect you to be silent? Get feedback from people at the meeting if you think you're coming across as too harsh. Some technologiest can get very enthusiastic about their subject-matter. Your passion may be confused with agression. You'd be shocked at how many people will take the attitude that you think you are a know-it-all who doesn't consider the opinions of others when you are just confdently voicing your opinion. 

I don't think that your boss doesn't care. Does he engage in any deep conversation with you at all? He may feel this topic will encourage you to leave (I really want to rage on people who feel this way!). I've worked for some people who were very sincere about learning what I wanted to do long-term and were quick to acknowledge those career goals weren't going to take place at the current company. They told me they would fire me if they had to, so I'd go on to do something better. Other managers pushed company paid training and certification, but more for the benefit of the company and not necessarily about my career growth. I've had a few managers that just didn't want to engage in any personal conversation. I got the impression they felt they could be a more effective manager by keeping their distance or they didn't want me to think they were prying into my personal life. If you talk about other subjects, ask why he has an aversion to talking about your career. If you never talk about anything, there's your answer. You may have to go outside your company for adviced. Maybe a local dev group or something? 

Can anyone really be sure one way or the other? Nothing lasts forever. Do you intend to continue to work for the company? Are you actively looking for a new job? If you have reasons to leave soon, then maybe you are being a little shady. Tell them all the positive things and what your impression is of the strength of the company (that is your job), and if you have any solid reasons why there may be some concern, mention a few of those. It will give you some credibility. I had an interview and was told up front that their industry was going through a tough time. Everyone can't expect to go into the workplace thinking every piece of information is open. There are some regulations about privacy especially if there is a potential purchase in the works. If that leaks, it could negatively impact the sale. Not all financial information can be in the open. Ignore the gossip and hearsay. You don't know for certain nor should you be expected to know. 

Even if he doesn't want to discuss work during breaks, meet with him anyway and talk about something. You may not like what he decides to talk about or you may have to work really hard to get him to talk, but I don't know what other choice you have. Even the most introverted programmers I've met will talk about code. You may find out he is under a lot of stress to get his current project finished and really doesn't have the energy to help you. When he does talk, make sure you listen. If your supervisor is expecting you to learn a lot from this person, you need to inform him. No one wants to get anyone in trouble, but when your job is dependent on someone who doesn't do their part, you have to take action. 

Like others said, you probably have nothing to worry about. However, be prepared to be asked for something more. It could be anything from offering you another job, trying to get sensitive information about your company or possibly a sexual advance. Regardless, if there is another encounter, make sure you do whatever it takes to pick up the bill the next time. 

He isn't keeping up his end of the deal. You can try and offer alternative times, but this person has no excuse for not keeping the time you have set; there may be problems he's not willing to admit like he has sleep issues. Be willing to work with him, but at some point, he is not allowed to waste your time. You have other things to do. I'm afraid a plan is going to need to set some realistic goals (no more than one missed day a week/month) and there have to be consequences for not complying. For whatever reason, your boss thinks this is important, so you should have support on being able to deal with this person. I hope it doesn't come to that. It seems like you're willing to be flexible and this person may be taking advantage of the situation. Also consider how he behaves at the meeting. Is he reluctant to talk with others? He gets things done so he should have any issues with not wanting to discuss any failures. 

Pay attention during the interview process especially if you get a chance to visit the office. I've had interviews where attendees had to "put out fires" during my interview. Others showed up late, rescheduled and basically showed how chaotic their world was. Some will tell you this is normal. Everyone is busy and working 80 hours a week, blah, blah, blah - nonsense. Good managers run the interference and create an environment where things can get done. If they don't show they're organized especially during the hiring process, other areas are probably a mess. Amazed at how over-worked teams don't make time to hire people and wonder why they're over-worked. Ask about how requirements are gathered and documented. Where do they track requests and projects? Do they have any established methodology or are they "kind-of-sort-of-agile/waterfall." 

You can do background checks but you need to "keep the honest people honest." There should be procedures in place to reconcile the drawer, deposits and inventory. People need to know you care enough to monitor these things. Put consequences in place if things are not accurate. It could be due to theft, carelessness, etc., but you just can't have this going on in your business. I worked at a movie theater and we counted every cup and box of candy nightly. It may not be practical to do this every night, but on some regular basis with a few "spot-checks" every once in a while. It's just good business. 

Are you asking for a raise or giving a reason for wanting a new job? It's hard to ask for a raise without asking for more money and who thinks there's anything wrong with asking for a raise? If you don't ask, you rarely get it. If you prefer or are willing to accept benefits, ask for those. If you're asked during an interview why you want a particular position or why you want to leave your current position, just saying, "I want more money" doesn't sound like you've given the question much thought. This should be one of many reasons. Rarely does anyone want less money, so it's a given. When you're going through the interview process, the subject of salary usually comes up in a couple of different forms: 1) here is the salary and/or range 2) they ask what you want. Usually, they ask what you are currently making. If what you are looking for is much higher, they get the picture. You can ask for more money without any justification. Who knows, you could get lucky. Imagine a sales person asking for higher prices so they get a higher commission. Most buyers would decline. 

I think you should address your situation in your cover letter. You've been a student, now you're looking for a position doing "X" or working in field "X", etc. adjust for each application as needed. People leave school, change majors, careers and don't need to go into detail why they "quit" but need to address what it is you want. Be positive. On the CV, just make sure you indicate your degree(s) and where you've been. Don't leave any gaps. Many full-time students are not employed at that time. If there is any coursework, lab experiences, etc. that are relevant, make sure you include them. Academia is a little different, but in most industries, leaving a phd program would not be looked at too negatively. 

How do you get them to do anything else? Now, if they're able to ignore meetings because they're actually doing their jobs, you may need to coordinate schedules a little more, setup separate meetings, alter work expectations. Is it absolutely necessary to have a meeting in person? Is there a history that suggests they're unproductive? Finally, punish one - teach a hundred. 

Unfortunately, most workplaces are managed in a reactive manner, so your boss may not do anything about it until several employees are sick at the same time and leave. Some people may not have a fever, so they may not be contagious (As a former school teacher, that was a good rule to send or keep kids home.). Check if your HR department has any guidelines. Also, you have to consider how people who take leave are actually treated in your company or by this person's supervisor. Too many people don't even use all their vacation time in these environments, so they may feel going home with "just a cold" is some sort of sign of weakness or not caring about their job. You could give this person a little encouragement (offer to pick up the slack?) to consider going home, but consider the consequences and the "unwritten rules" of your company culture. 

I've known people who adhere to open door policy, but you don't have to take it literally. Develop real relationships with people in the office and you don't have to worry about how they interpret your closed door. When people have questions, tell them to stop by and don't worry if the door is closed. Let them know you're trying to keep the room warm. My guess is they know about the lack of heat situation. Bring some treats to the office and invite people over to share. Again, address the closed door situation when you invite them. Eventually, this person should come to the conclusion that the fear of a closed door being misinterpreted is unfounded. Hopefully, the real problem isn't claustrophobia. If that is the case, it is in everyone's interest to not have this person confined to an office. 

Assuming a recruiter gets paid a percentage of your first year's salary, this is a bad idea. I realize their clients (employers not employees) may want to factor this in, but these people are suppose to be good at sales. They should be steering their clients to focus on offering a competitive wage to attract the best candidates regardless of what someone was willing to accept as a salary. Be honest about your current and expected salary. You like your job in spite of the salary and will leave if the pay is significantly higher. This is part of negotiating. Ask them why they feel a need to share your current salary with their client. If they tell you, "That's what the client wants." then ask them if they are a sales person or an order taker. Recruiters need to "churn" positions. What better way to do that than to provide higher salaries? 

I think good programmers/workers probably put more stress on themselves then their supervisors. It is possible that all the good workers have the luxury of avoiding jobs with overbearing employers. Unfortunately in an interview situation, things are a little contrived and they put pressure on you. Who knows how they'll interpret it. Programming can be a very frustrating job. You're building things that have not been created before, there are limitations outside your control (like time limits) and often it is unclear what you're being asked to build. Frustrations can build up and it is important to you and your employer that you be able to manage it. Hopefully, you've been able to maintain a quiet and peaceful work environment because you do have self-control and don't let problems get to you even though you're being fully challenged. EDIT: I don't think this is automatically a red flag. There are some good stressors that motivate people to do their best. They key is how you handle it because it's going to handle. When someone buys your product and it doesn't work, there is going to be some stress.
