Head = (most) important. So natural that examples are hardly needed. Head = first. "Headwaters", "headline", "head off" (get there first), "ahead" (first), etc. For some cross-linguistic confirmation from an unrelated language, consider e.g. Hebrew Rosh Hashanah lit. "head of the year", translated "New Year's Day". (The root of rosh incidentally appears in many words, including bereshit usually translated "in the beginning"). Head = orientation. "Ahead" (in the direction faced), "head somewhere", "head fake", etc. Perhaps by connection with face (which direction are you facing?). 

Your speculation is more or less right, not a weak argument at all. In a word like רַבִּי ~ ῥαββί ~ rabbi we can see the influence of Hebrew/Aramaic. The dot you see in the beth is, as you probably already know, a dagesh. The dagesh in Hebrew indicates various pronunciations whose common feature is that they involve a "stronger" version of a sound. For example, a beth without a dagesh was pronounced as the fricative /β/ whereas one with a dagesh was pronounced as the stop /b/. The underlying phonological processes for this were various. One of them is simply forte/lene positions, e.g. postconsonantal vs. postvocalic. Another is duplication. Semitic languages have a root system where words usually consist of three consonants, and one of the "defective" root types is roots where two consecutive consonants are the same. They are defective because in speech those two consonants tended to merge into one long consonant, which was also represented in writing. That long consonant, even if originally a weak version of the phoneme, would then become a strong version. For example, /β:/ would be /b/ (I can't remember right now if that would be /b/ or /b:/). As one of the indicators of the root, this pronunciation carried semantic value. The caveat is that the dagesh was invented long after the time of both Hebrew and Koine Greek. Thus, in the Hebrew writing system of the time, strong/weak pronunciations of certain letters were not marked. Problematically, a casual reader of that word with a cursory knowledge of Hebrew would probably conclude that it was weak because of its postvocalic position. My speculation is therefore that the Koine Greek spelling you identify is an attempt to represent that difference. We can see in the modern writing system that רַבִּי has a strong beth, but they could only hear it, not see it. So the transliterators into Koine Greek opted to helpfully mark it. 

These sentences differ by just one letter, but from Marie's point of view they're pretty different. After all, in one she's la, walking across campus, and in the other she's lui, staying in her office. :) But in any case (no pun intended), as jlliagre said, the category of Romance or Latinate language doesn't imply that all the qualities were inherited. It's more about a genetic history than it is about functional similarity. Linguistic apples sometimes fall far from their trees. 

Each of these is one example of large sets of ambiguous cases! In short, the entry in the lexicon presumably carries some of the information needed to settle these cases — not just the meaning. 

I find this telling: It's not necessarily linguists who are the most curious about sound symbolism nowadays, but anthropologists. And it's not so much digraphs that hold interest, but ideophones (more or less onomatopœia). One thing I will suggest is that popular conceptions of phonesthetics are based on poorly defined criteria. One question is what happens when we find counterexamples. Take the notorious glitter, glisten, glow, gleam, etc. idea. How about glad, gland, glutton, glacier, glitch, globe, gloat, and glob, which have nothing to do with light or vision? Do they matter and if so to what degree? Perhaps unclear questions like these are why practicioners of the an increasingly scientific field of linguistics feel the need to apologize for their interest in the phenomena, even in the abstracts of papers studying them. (Incidentally, I don't think there are many ancient ideas about language that would still be studied today without an apologetic tone.) 

We propose different underlying structures to account for the different behaviour of the -ing form, but I would say it's difficult to parse at best and theoretically hazy at worst. As has been pointed out below, sometimes this form is simply referred to as a "gerund-participle", and computer parsers treat it quite variably, from a V heading a VP to an N heading an NP to a "G" heading either one to, most perplexingly, a V heading an NP! In any case, however, it's not a part of speech, but the term is used to refer to one or more verbal forms that behave like various parts of speech. 

Explanation First, there's no need to insert a ל to עד "witness" to form לעד when עד on its own is already a homonym meaning "forever". The ל is a preposition that would yield something like "unto eternity". Incidentally, another homonym is עד "filthy", derived from a root related to setting a period of time, seemingly connected to the menstrual cycle. I presume Biblical hermeneuticists aren't keen to hang all these meanings on the same peg. So how do we determine which homonyms are polysemous, i.e. extensions of a single root? One way when we have roots of only two letters is to find the three-letter root that it comes from. (This is an assumption made when studying Hebrew that can be questioned, but no need to here.) Roots where we can't see the third consonant are "defective". There are a few ways to "repair" a defective root, i.e. determine the third consonant. One is to look for a weak consonant that's likely to disappear: the vowel-like ו vav, ה heth, or י yod. One might come before, between, or after the two letters we can see, as in the common קום q-w-m "to rise". One set of reconstructions would thus be יעד y-ʕ-d or עיד ʕ-y-d or עדי ʕ-d-y. There are also cases where a letter is commonly dropped from the beginning, e.g. the נ in נגד n-g-d "to tell" or the ל in לקח l-q-kh "to take", which are often missing in conjugations. But these cases are rare. And as I mentioned, looking for a lost ל at the start is pointless since the ל in לעד is a preposition, not part of the verbal root. We can also look for a consonant that naturally assimilates into another. This typically happens with geminate roots, i.e. roots with two of the same consonant, such as רעע r-ʕ-ʕ "to do evil". That would let us reconstruct maybe עדד ʔ-d-d. Once you have some candidates you go look for attestations in your dictionary or the text itself. In the text, you can find parallel conjugations. For example, we know that "middle-weak" roots are conjugated a certain way. Do we have any examples of a verbal עד that are conjugated like קום? Or we know that geminate verbs are conjugated another way. Do we have any examples of a verbal עד that are conjugated like רעע ? And so on. Also key is to compare related languages in which the "defective" consonant has not disappeared. Is there an Arabic, Aramaic, Assyrian, or Akkadian root, for example, that corresponds to a hypothetical עדי ? Having found viable candidates, you then try to match up meanings to establish a reasonable semantic derivation, which is where some disagreement might come in. Sometimes it isn't a purely semantic argument but the vowels of the noun can also give hints as to root it came from. Something like this has been done for many obscure words in the Bible, and to make a long story short, at least one source relates the different words spelled עד to the roots I noted at the start. 

Psycholinguistics One direction of possible interest for the cross-linguistic non-arbitrary hypothesis is psycholinguistic. A well-known experiment involves the bouba/kiki effect. In short, speakers of many languages associate the nonsense word "bouba" with rounded, cloud-like figures but "kiki" with spiky ones. Synesthesia appears to be involved.1 In a similar vein, the Bankieris & Simner article above includes these highlights from the abstract: 

While the other answer is technically correct, here's one that might be more readily accessible. Sounds are generally made and distinguished based on where you put your tongue (of course). For some sounds, your tongue is relatively low and allows a constant stream of air to pass over it. This is the basic definition of a vowel: 'oo', 'ah', 'ee' ... For some sounds, your tongue nearly closes the gap, but not quite. The air experiences some "friction" as it passes over. For example, 'sss', 'fff', 'thhh'... Because of that friction these are called fricatives. For other sounds, your tongue completely closes the gap. The air is actually blocked, and the sound you hear is the air being released. These are called "stops" and include 'd' and 'k'. Now, you can't release the air slowly when making these sounds. It's like striking a match. Either it's fast or your brain doesn't think it's a 'd' or a 'k'. 

The author hasn't been very careful about "ordinary". He just means "non-linguistic". A sign, as the chapter says, is a pair of things: a signifier (what you sense by sight, hearing, etc.) and something signified. A linguistic sign is one where the signifier is part of a language, usually a spoken or written word. By "ordinary sign", then, the author means one where the signifier is not part of language. The author gives the example of a clock. Say a clock face has the long hand pointing to 0 degrees (north) and the short hand pointing to 90 degrees (east). 

We can't know exactly which quality led so many languages to independently develop or borrow the metaphor — etymological dictionaries rarely speculate on the "why" — but here are my thoughts. There are at least three qualities of "head" that have a possible metaphor with "chapter". 

I think it would be possible, if cumbersome, for a hypothetical language to avoid proper nouns. Writing the aliens' dialogue in a book might not be fun, but it might work for an occasional detail. The question is, what function do proper nouns fill? And can anything else do that job? Proper nouns pick out a particular entity or set of entities. They are a shorthand. There are other ways to do that, often used if you don't know the name for a thing. These include possessives, predicates, and pronouns.* 

TL;DR עד "witness" is probably derived from עוד ʕ-w-d "to admonish, affirm, turn about", whereas עד "forever" is probably derived from the unrelated עדה ʕ-d-h "pass on, advance". 

I try to avoid "survey/list" questions like these to which there's no right answer, but here's one... My aunt, a linguist and translator in Nepal, reports that the Indo-Aryan language Maithili has a word that shares the meanings "yesterday" and "tomorrow". In other words, it means "one day removed" and is qualified by a phrase like "that is yet to come" or "that has already come" to disambiguate the two (when the context doesn't make it obvious). Come to think of it, my grandma, who ran a school in Pakistan, said that Urdu works like that too. One dictionary seems to support that; "yesterday" and "tomorrow" both yield کل kal. Hopefully this "bifurcated" indexical constitutes an example of a "non-standard" one. 

These are consistent, as Draconis and fdb point out, but represent exceptional cases in view of the overall verbal system. 

Catalogue search The article for phonesthetics (or "sound symbolism") indicates that it's a very old question. But in the "modern" part of that article, the story seems to peter out in the 1970s and '80s. However, a simple search ("phonoesthetics", "phonestheme", "sound symbolism", "sound semantics" in scholarly articles, book reviews, and conference proceedings) using the University of Toronto catalogue suggests that the situation is the reverse. The research is accelerating: 

Edited into something slightly more useful in light of the comments below. A gerund is not a part of speech in that it is not a category on the level of noun, verb, determiner, preposition, etc. (Of course, you can ask: "What part of speech is that?" when pointing to a gerund, as you can with any word.) There is a range of items that look gerund-like, and delineating this range is not easy. There are "gerunds", "participles" and, in some terminologies, "(de)verbal nouns" and so forth. The former two are considered forms of verbs. But classifying a given word ending in "-ing" as one or the other of these categories may depend mostly on its behaviour as a noun or verb in the context. Here's one context that perhaps helps to delineate them: 

TL;DR The notion that sounds carry inherent meanings certainly figures in folk ideas about language; it somehow matches many people's intuitions. But a non-arbitrary connection between sound and sense obviously violates some principles of modern linguistics. There is lots of research being done right now, but it often involves an acknowledgement that the phenomena are underdeveloped and/or not accepted in mainstream linguistics. Also, we should distinguish between a universal, interlinguistic sound-meaning connection and merely intralinguistic patterns. The former seems hard to defend, but ideas about synesthesia may be reopening the question. The latter seems to be cropping up in a large number of articles. This answer may change further if curiosity leads me to keep prodding the subject... 

Let's investigate using the OED. Their etymology is a good example of how we usually ignore the "why" while charting the "how"; nothing here identifies the link used in the metaphor: 

* I mention that pronouns are one of the strategies to avoid proper nouns. Obviously these are a huge help. And I can't imagine a language that could function without them. Even to identify the speaker ("I") or the listener ("you") in any conversation would become monumentally difficult. That said, there are languages that have bigger sets of pronouns than we do whose speakers might wonder how on earth we get by... :)
