In short, unless you stipulate very precisely what you imagine the world to be like (that is, present the question as one of physics rather than metaphysics), a principle of continuity such as you describe is not enough to prevent the emergence of something from nothing, unless it also prevents change even in worlds with something. 

which is a moral absurdity which follows from the fact that telling a hard truth is socially transgressive, and that while making someone cry is not a good course of action, it is a better choice of action than the other possible consequences of telling a hard truth. Indeed, the crux of the paradox here is that the triad of OB¬p, OB¬q, and ¬p⇒q form a moral dilemma. If ¬p, we obtain (q & OB¬q), which, while not a contradiction, is an expression of a violation of one's social obligations. The alternative in this case is to choose ¬q, in which case we may derive (p & OB¬p); which is also a violation of obligations. This is the same as the transgression (p & OB¬p) in the Gentle Murder paradox. In any case, the issue here seems entirely to be based upon a socially transgressive premise, from which one can derive a formula of the form (p & OB¬p); and that there are different strengths of obligation, so that some moral absurdities (you should make someone cry, you should kill someone gently) are less terrible than others (you should make someone angry and violent, you should kill someone brutally). 

There are a number of things which are problematic with identifying infinity with zero, with entertaining the idea that they are equal. The first you should ask what you really mean by equality. How serious are you about the idea that "zero" and "infinity" refer to the same concept? How many Bengal tigers are there, for instance, in your immediate vicinity — none, or infinitely many? (If there happen to be one or two, would you expect there to be infinitely many of them if those two went away?) I would suspect that there being zero Bengal tigers nearby to you would appear very differently to you than there being infinitely many. This gets to the heart of what mathematics is actually for: it's for describing features of the world that you see around you — and for being able to express different ways that the world could be, which you could distinguish from one another if you wished to. If it were somehow "really the case" that zero and infinity were equal — that is, if this somehow were a deep meaningful feature of the world — why are we not being constantly assaulted by (or at least crushed to death under the weight of) infinitely many Bengal tigers? A better response might be to say that "zero" is not the same as "infinity" on the level of tigers or birds, but only for other physical phenomena, such as matter in the universe. (This would already indicate that the two concepts of zero and infinity are meaningfully different, and that what we're talking about is not mathematics, but physics proper.) Perhaps it is only a meaningful way of describing things on the quantum mechanical level. But here it is no better: why are there not infinitely massive balls of neutrons and protons and electrons popping out of vaccuum — not just a handful with some probability, but infinitely many, all the time, because "nothing is the same as everything"? Sure, it would crush the universe to a tiny speck under the instantaneous emergence of black holes all over the place; but this just gives us a way to see that it isn't happening, not of explaining why it doesn't if somehow "zero" equals "infinity". The problem is that even if you restrict yourself to "the quantum mechanical scale", saying that "zero equals infinity" doesn't allow you to describe features of the physical world with enough precision to explain why at any moment we aren't consumed by black holes. Note that the statement "on a quantum mechanical scale" is itself a vague statement. Most physicists believe that matter behaves according to quantum mechanics at all scales, it's just that for objects which are large and rigid enough, we can use less complicated models of physics such as Newtonian mechanics to describe what's going on. So even saying "on a quantum mechanical scale" is insufficient to save us from an infinite avalanche of bengal tigers. If we want to put teeth into a statement such as this, we need something subtler than equality; we need actual numbers and differences, to describe differences in size and in probability. This is another problem which is touched on by your question. Quantum mechanics does indeed depend on "randomness"; but randomness is not the same as "anything can happen". For instance, a dice roll is random: but would you expect to roll a seven on a single die, because it is random? More precisely, not everything that can happen will actually happen: if you rolled the die a thousand times and only rolled sixes and twos, wouldn't you come to suspect something was wrong? But certainly it's possible. The problem with the die which rolls only sixes and twos is that it violates your expectations, which is a way of observing that there are limits and averages which you can expect from the die. Similarly, although quantum mechanics is random — and also to our macroscopically-honed expectations, strange — this does not mean that it's a free-for-all of strangeness at all times. The very fact that we have a theory of quantum mechanics that works at all, indicates that it has regularity and predictability about it; it only has less predictability than a deterministic theory of physics in which we can finely control the initial conditions of the system. So what could it mean for "zero" to be the same as "infinity"? Well: all numbers — including simple ones, such as 1, 2, 3 — are just ideas, and they can mean different things in different contexts. When you roll a die, the number 6 doesn't mean anything, although you might give that number signifcance by doing something specific. In the game of craps in which you roll a pair of dice, 7 and 11 are good rolls and 2, 3, 12 are bad ones; but that does not mean that somehow 7 = 11 or that 2 = 3 = 12 in any deeper sense. These are just human games, of course; but numbers are human ideas with which we try to grasp the world with acuity. The roles of any numbers in a physical theory do not arise from the numbers themselves, but from their interpretation as referring to magnitudes of physical qualities which interact with one another. So the only way to assess whether or not zero is "equal to" infinity in some physical theory is to see whether the two concepts are effectively the same in that theory, at least for the main quantities of interest. For the physical theories that I know of, the answer is a resounding no. This does not mean that there could not be another, very useful theory in which some quantity such as mass or time somehow might be meaningfully interpreted in such a way that zero equals infinity, but that will be a question of that model of physics, and not of reality itself. In the end, zero and infinity are the names of ideas, of metaphors that we use to grasp the world — they are the map and not the territory. (If you want to ask about whether the lack of any existence is identical to everything existing at once, without reference to mathematics, that would be a separate question, but one for which I doubt that there is an interesting answer; I would say it is either "no" or "there's no way to find out", depending on what limitations you put on the multiply existing worlds.) 

The label "unknown known" thus is a label which suggests a sort of gloss for two seemingly different concepts. Inasmuch as we have knowledge and world-models through rich associations to life and experience, these two concepts may point to different routes of investigating precisely the phenomenon described by "unconscious beliefs and prejudices that determine how we perceive reality". However, the label "unknown known" is just a label, and one which is perhaps provocatively chosen; it does not refer in any meaningful way to any paradoxical structure in the concept to which it refers. A book which is stored on a library shelf but which is not catalogued is a similar sort of "unknown known", though library books do not quite play the same dynamical role, because researchers do not (often) go to the library and open up library books at random. In the case of the book, "unindexed content" would be an entirely uncontrovertial label for the same concept, referrring to the existence of data and metadata. The human brain does not seem to have as clear a separation between data and metadata in the same way. What "unknown known" is trying to get at is how the residual network topology which remains from forgotten knowledge, or from knowledge which one has but which one applies reflexively / absent-mindedly / without awarenes, affects cognition. It can range from things which genuinely are knowledge (which one could remember, but forgets that one knows), to things which one could only remember with a mighty struggle and possibly re-constructing ideas or memories (i.e. artificially and in a process not unlike learning something anew). In this respect, even the label "knowledge" is inappropriate, in that it only very coarsely encapsulates the significance of the concept involved. Finally, the idea that we should even concieve of it as "knowledge" is perhaps misguided. What is significant is not that it is knowledge which one might consider abstractly, but that it colours how one sees the world whether or not one even has access to it as information or an idea per se. So perhaps it might be better termed as a paraconception: not quite ideation, but related to it and taking place alongside it. Inasmuch as anything that I've said above makes any sense, what we see is that classical logic does a perfectly good job of presenting a model for the specific example of an "unknown known", once one pushes past the mere label of the thing to consider the actual phenomenon which one wishes to discuss. On the role of qualia in influencing logic Regarding your edit, the things which you describe (unusual mental states, unusual sensory experiences, and avant-garde artistic works) don't really in themselves have any content upon which logic may act. A novel or unusual experience may change elements of the inner structure or chemical balance of the brain, and thereby influence how things are perceived, but they do not consist themselves of propositions upon which logic may be brought to bear — and to be seen to fail. It is the conceptions — the way in which one fits one's experiences into a framework of experience in order to make sense of the world — with which one may attempt to reason logically, so the qualia in themselves cannot necessitate a change in one's logical mode of reasoning. They may motivate a change in how one theorizes about the world — the assumptions and hypotheses that one entertains, the questions that one regards as interesting — but this is different from changing what one considers to be the structure of a logical argument. Logic is just the way that one tries to combine ideas to extract the consequences of those ideas, in a way which preserves the truth of those ideas — and we have so far found that, in practise, one can change the ideas with which one reasons without changing the logic with which one tries to reason about them. It is possible that an extrasensory experience, or a particularly profound "normal" sensory experience, might suggest ways of conceiving the world which are so radically different that it also suggests new ways to reason effectively, or that it demonstrates that some accepted ways of reasoning are actually not effective. This has arguably happened already, for reasons which are more mundane. Around the time that foundations of mathematics were being explored in the late 19th century, a schism of this sort arose concerning reasoning about infinities, and whether classical modes of reasoning such as reductio ad absurdum and double negation were valid ways of reasoning about the existence of individual elements within infinite collections. This gave rise a divergent notions of effective modes of reasoning, intuitionism/constructivism, which among other things only regards the existence of mathematical objects as established if a specific example can be exhibited by valid modes of construction (rather than, for instance, showing that a contradiction arises if one assumes that no object of the kind exists). Even though I generally accept "traditional" logic, I find this stronger standard of valid reasoning worthwhile; it presents a standard of reasoning which is aligned well with my own epistemic values, and forces one to reason in such a way that one has a more complete knowledge of the object under consideration. But it is also harder to work with, and classical logic does not seem to be any less reliable, so much as it opens up easier but less informative routes to the same conclusions which constructivism does. So, as with the example of quantum mechanics above, how one attempts to conceive of the world actually can motivate a change in what forms of arguments — what logic — one accepts as generally valid. But it also does not necessarily do so; it's only a question as which mode of logical reasoning one finds most effective for a purpose. Indeed, it is possible to experiment with or embrace different modes of logical reasoning according to one's purpose — essentially selecting them according to some pre-logical and essentially aesthetic grounds, based on one's experience of what has proven effective in the past (which is not too different from empirical testing of theories in general).
