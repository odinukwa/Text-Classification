And a flourishing system of bribery and corruption is born. :-) The vast majority will consider the application of these rules unjust, and unjust laws tend to be ignored at best or subverted at worst by at least a minority and often by a majority. 

People tend not to marry (or get together or stay together) for logical reasons. And thank heaven for this fact. And people will get together despite knowing they're getting a partner with problems. Nothing ever has stopped this. 

Which is exactly the way we did evolve. Your mistake is excluding developing a belief in a God or Gods is reasonable not a way of dealing with some of those puzzles. Realistically there is no way for early man to answer questions like "what is fire ?" and "what is lightning ?" or "what are the stars ?". Any answer you form will be a wild guess and in some ways it's simpler to just put these aside and file them under "Work of God" until you have the tools to investigate more. 

This is the worst choice possible. It was being explored and fished in for as long as we have paper records, and maybe before that. It's not a place you can hide an island bigger than a family car. And because European governments were always keen on grabbing every bit of land they could find and stuffing a flag and some troops on it (it's a habit we got into) you'd be an English/French/Spanish/Dutch/Portuguese colony in no time - if not all of them in turn. So not the Atlantic. The Pacific was lovely and quiet by comparison (until WW2). In practical terms the best approach is to hide in plain sight. Visually hiding it is no good - radar and thermal imaging would spot it. Hiding the civilization underground won't work either - they would have thermal signatures and military surveillance is particularly interested in looking for underground complexes. You mentioned magic and this does tend to mean they can just magic themselves out of the way, but it's so arbitrary I am ignoring it. People travel everywhere and mysterious bit of unexplored area tend to attract the curious. The words "no one's ever check that bit" would be like a magnet to geologists, oceanographers, explorers and people trying to get away from everyone else. Short version : you can't hide so don't. You hide in plain sight. You create an apparently poor looking culture, not great climate, no attractive beaches and dull as a very dull thing landscapes. That should keep most people away. Be entirely unhelpful to any visitors. Stick a bunch of natural obstacles around the island to deter visitors. Nasty jagged rocks just below the sea which are tedious to navigate through, lousy currents prone to drowning the unwary and just be a nuisance enough to deter those determined to be nosy. Geographically a hilly, rocky place where not much grows but you can graze cattle and live a minimal life (or so it seems). No area large enough to e.g. plonk a runway. No bays ideal for sheltering the fleet. Cliff faces that deter the beach dwelling types and no exciting hills or volcanoes that attract climbers or geologists. Dull, boring, unattractive. Initially these things would deter most explorers (although not European monarchies that will colonize places like the Falklands/Malvinas, which are exactly as described :-) ). Now you can hide the real civilization just behind the scenes. This part is important : minimize EM radiation - island wide wi-fi is not a good idea to stay hidden. If you set up any comms use carefully hidden wiring. Likewise keep thermal emission low or find an excuse for that big thermal hot spot where your generators and industrial equipment are : the island is, after all, allowed to have some industry to keep it going, and it's probably inefficient (or so it appears) and maybe that will do it. Get rid of any wildlife that could even remotely interest a biologist - those guys are a pain to get rid of. So people visiting glance at it and go, "bit dull, no beaches, no oil, no minerals, no agriculture worth speaking of, no internet - get me out of here !". Keep in mind that you mind find that periodically your island is occupied for strategic reasons in times of war. This normally results in the said military leaving when the need of the moment is past and leaving nothing more than a mess behind. Likewise by hiding in plain sight you allow your own people to quite legitimately visit the outside world without raising any real interest beyond "what's Mystery Island like anyway ?", "quiet, dull, poor, no internet" - conversation ends. You can even join the UN and do the normal things : never support any vote or initiative that would draw attention to yourselves. I'm sure you can do a better job of this idea if you give it a go. Now I consider magic to be a cop-out, but maybe your islanders can use magic a little to help with this. Whip up a nasty storm that sinks or damages a lot of ship when someone starts parking their fleet around you, that sort of thing ("luckily" the islanders will survive, shaken bur in one piece). 

Attack what inside and what is exposed. No matter how you skin your creature it's going to suffer just as much from impact damage (think e.g. broken bones) and things like suffocation or crushing. In addition shock waves from impacts will still travel through the body and cause damage. In this regard consider the effect of a nearby shell burst to a human which does not cause any exterior sign of injury. It can still rupture internal organs as a result of the shock wave and kill in moments. An animal can blind you either temporarily or permanently. Deafen you. Simply immobilize you. Eventually you starve to death. Drag you to e.g. water and drown you. I can heat you. Even if your skin is intact, the heat will cause damage internally and most creatures can be killed by heat (or lack of it) pretty quickly. Poison. Always a good choice. 

World War 3 as it's also known. Unless you know a reason the Chinese would let you do this, it's an exceptionally dangerous move that could rapidly escalate into WW3. What exactly would you expect the Chinese response be to the first dead Chinese national ? Lousy plan. 

And yet people do it anyway. And always have. Love, as they say, is blind. Blind, deaf and tragically dumb. So Bob probably will find a wife if he wants to. And, more to the point, he's a criminal and they're not known for their honesty and for being open with their partners. So Bob will happily lie to Alice to get what he wants. And a flourishing market in providing fake background checks (or simple bribery) will let Bob hide his past for "long enough" to mess up Alice's life. 

Like waiting for a letter from a sailor at sea in the old days. But an alternative may be possible ... Your speedster can employ any means to communicate which is written - i.e. does not depend on the ability to communicate using any frequency based system like talking. Let's pick email. Now I take between a few minutes and a day to reply to most emails depending on what they say and urgency. Your speedster replies, from the point of view of ordinary time, in the blink of an eye, so that's no problem. But you speedster must wait a very long time for replies to her emails. Every minute it takes to reply in the real world equates to 60 days (two months !) in the Speedster's world. So your speedster sends an email and a minimum of two months later gets a reply. But it's entirely outside your speedster's control how long it could take. If a reply took an hour in the real world your speedster has seen the equivalent of nearly four years (!) so by. If they took a day to reply, your speedster sees the equivalent of 94 years pass - and in all probability your speedster died waiting for a reply. From your speedster's point of view communicating with the ordinary world would be like a person on land waiting for a letter from a sailor in the days before radio and telegraph. A letter might come, it might not. It would be months between letters or even years. The Alternative ... Your Speedsters can't get much from communicating with statues like humans. But consider a world where AI's exist and are able to communicate and think much faster than humans. They'd be a natural for your speedster to communicate with. Note a typical display can refresh at speeds no faster than about 200 Hz (200 times a second). So the shortest period an AI would be able to send a new message to your speedster would be the equivalent of about 7 minutes to your speedster. A more conventional 60 Hz display would bring that up to about 25 minutes between messages. Note this also works the same way for your speedster trying to e.g. learn something from an internet page. It takes at least a second to refresh a typical page including time to fetch it, so your speedster has to wait an entire day (from her point of view) to read the next page. Difficult to learn with that problem. Turning paper would be just as problematic as turning it too fast would shred it, or worse, so your speedster would need to be very patient. 

TLDR : Not going to happen. Despite the shell theorem there is a net force between the two. Object (a) on the outside ("the shell") does not exert any net force on any part of object (b) ("the core") regardless of the relative positions as long as (b) is entirely enclosed in (a) and (a) is spherically symmetrical. That's an absolute result from the Shell Theorem. But the core (b) does exert a net attraction on every part of the shell (a). The shell theorem does not apply outside an object. So the core will attract the shell and, as there must be an equal and opposite reaction, the core will also feel a force balancing that. But this is a very, very unstable configuration. The instant the core's center shifts even a fraction off the exact center of the shell it will inexorably move off the center, most likely accelerating into a collision with the shell. Likewise if either the core or the shell are not perfectly spherically symmetrical they will drift off and eventually most likely collide. 

Being able to borrow has to have greater appeal that stealing your money. This is simply a matter of common sense for most rulers, as if he screws over the loyal (you are loyal, right ?) help of a subject, who will help voluntarily, volunteers will start to become hard to find. More importantly people will move their money and themselves out of his control. Having to force everyone to help you sound fun, except that eventually that's how monarchs end up as deposed monarchs and the sensible ones don't risk this. But to lend to monarchs you do have to accept that they will pay you back on their terms. You might get leverage from this, favorable terms on some other deal you want to do, but you won't get to guarantee anything. Interest from your own King to finance this patriotic endeavor is entirely optional from your point of view, just as applying thumbscrews to parts of your body other than your thumbs is entirely optional for your King. The expression we're looking for here is "happy to help, your Highness, interest free goes without saying.". If you're very, very lucky, you might get a title other than "victim" out of it.
