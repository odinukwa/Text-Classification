The game as a whole is made simpler and more coherent if it is only possible to move forward when attacking, and this requires that it not be possible to move forward when defending. To be attacking, a team must have possession, one way or another. The exception is backward movement made as part of the attack, i.e. the snap and any backward passes or runs: the attacking team sacrifices territory now in order to gain territory in several seconds. Each attempt at moving the ball forward is called a down. A down ends when the player with the ball is tackled (see further definition later) or leaves the field of play, some kind of score occurs, a pass is incomplete, or the player in possession stops making forward progress. Note that 

A caution can only be given for one of six reasons, and a suspension for one of seven reasons. That reduces the amount required to remember; an offence is in one of just thirteen categories. Systems exist to shorten the writing needed. For example, in one possible system 

To advance is to move forward; to be advanced is to have moved, or be in a position which is comparatively, forward of some other place. In football the primary division of the field is the half, by the centreline. Thus, an advanced area is best understood to be one which is forward of the team's own half, i.e. a position in which that team is attacking. 

The UEFA Champion's League uses goal-line technology. This is an automated system which detects the moment the ball has crossed the goal-line under the crossbar. It sends a signal to the referee via a wrist-mounted alarm unit to show a goal has been scored. This reduces the reliance on precise visual judgements from bad angles. The referee indicated that the GLT unit had already signalled a goal. 

Find the average tee-to-green score, then subtract the player's tee-to-green score, and that's the negative of SG(tee-green). Is this the same as the value given by the equation? If so, there's no problem. If not, then that's your answer. No? 

Philosophically or factually? It's yes in both cases. Deliberately breaking a rule, and choosing to not play in the spirit of the game, are both considered cheating. 

The ball neither needs to pitch nor strike inline, if it was coming from outside off into the stumps, in order to give Out, Leg before wicket. This is the basis of the original decision. The two flags for Pitching - inline and Impact - inline only some green if they are actually inline, even though that is not always necessary for Leg before wicket. As long as the third and important flag (Wickets - hitting) is green, the correct decision is Out. See Law 36, part 1.2 for the pitching and part 1.4 for the contact. Note that this assumes "the striker has made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat". As this aspect of the law comes outside the scope of UDRS, it must be assumed the umpire decided no genuine attempt to play the ball was made. 

The yacht with least distance along the minimal path to the end line will be considered "winning". This is apparent in the leaderboard with Thomson's distance au but ("distance to the goal") being listed, and the other yachts listed as distance au 1er ("distance to first-placer"). In the case of second and third only a tenth of a nautical mile separates the required distance for the yachts. They will appear very close because relatively speaking, they are very close together. 

What you're doing is reckless, dangerous and stupid. Players underneath you could be seriously harmed or killed by it. Stop doing it or get out of the game. The officials have a duty to safety of the players. That you don't understand this already, suggests you are playing at a very low level of the sport, where this duty is even more important, as the lack of skill compounds the effect of situations where accidental injury is likely. 

There is ostensibly no requirements in law that the referee wait (while the wording and structure of Law 12, in addition to all statements about time, delays and restarts, suggest that referees should aspire to the least amount of delay possible). As a practical matter, the referee needs to ensure the player knows they have been cautioned, as that fact significantly alters both tactical and strategic choices for the player and their team. It also clarifies to other players, officials and spectators that this is the player being cautioned, especially when other players and officials are gathered around the injured player. Finally, it provides for the injured player to be treated quickly if possible, and whether they will need to leave the field so that the caution should be given prior. In sum, it is an issue of common sense and effectiveness from several angles. I am not aware of any official materials on the matter, but it is likely some of them refer to this practise either implicitly or explicitly. 

An umpire who deems the actions to breach the above rule, in particular that repeatedly serving early is "conduct that may unfairly affect an opponent" has a number of sanctions available, which are listed in the remainder of rule 18. They include sequentially: a warning, the award of a point, the award of two points together (18.2.3), and suspension of play preceding a report to the referee (18.2.4). The referee has the sanction available of disqualifying the player from the match, event or tournament (18.2.7). 

Having dealt with similarly out-of-alignment teeth when fitting a mouthguard, an excellent 'hack' is using scissors to remove part of the "wall" from a boil-and-bite mouth guard where the tooth would block it, then fit as normal. However, the tooth will continue to pose a risk of injury through piercing the gum or cheek, or having less protection for the tooth itself. Discuss with your dentist or orthodontist how this can be addressed. It's a hassle to have emergency treatment for gashes in the mouth or fractured teeth, too. 

Record an individual score for each player as $(f,a)$ where $f$ is the number of goals scored by that player's team when that player was actively playing, and $a$ similarly the goals against their team. This means a sub, or someone who left early or arrived late or left the field or switched teams partway through, doesn't get credit for a goal scored by their team if they couldn't possibly have contributed to the goalscoring situation, and similarly don't get marked against if they couldn't have done anything to prevent the goal. You could add a third component $p$, which is how many goals a player personally scores, if there are individuals who often get the decisive strike or final touch. Having established this system, future teams are picked such that the 2-norm of differences of sums is minimised. For example, a team has $(F,A)=(17,10)$ and their opponents have $(14,8)$. The differences are 3 and 2; the squares are 9 and 4; the sum is 13; the 2-norm is therefore $âˆš13=3.6$. If there is no way to trade exactly one player from each team and lower that value, then this is the "fairest" way to pick two teams from that group of players. If you have a $p$-score as well, the difference between $P$-scores must be as small as possible (this balances the amazing strikers separately from picking teams). This is a simple system to score for: either they were on the field or they weren't, and either their team scored or was scored against, each time a goal happens. It gives some measure of attacking and defending ability, especially after several games or when several players are added together. It can be modified for creating three fair teams from a group of players (this requires more math than needed here). It can even be applied after every single goal, especially if a computer spreadsheets is being used to record scores and calculate teams. If you don't like the 2-norm team calculation, the $(p,f,a)$ system gives you something to start with, anyway.
