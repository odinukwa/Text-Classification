1) Walk over to his desk and show him how to open the code on his computer. (If you are not in the same location call him then suggest a screen share). 2) Be patient and answer all his questions. 3) Once he has none left, ask if there is anything else he would like\need, point out that there is a week left!. 4) Once done, tell him nicely but firmly "If you have question about my work, just ask, I will be more than happy to explain, there are no need for threats" 5) Followup up 2 days later asking if everything is OK. Lastly he may be asking for the SSIS Solution rather than the SSIS Package, Who knows,regardless, you need to remind him that you are on the same team and expect him to act like it. 

How early could you apply generally for jobs? How much waiting time can you give employers before you are able to work? Is it a deal breaker for employers if the applicants aren't available in 1-4 weeks' time? 

I'm in quite of a bind here. Although this is unintentional, I've found myself in an awkward situation where I've been offered a job that I'm interested in while being on annual leave, and I'm not coming back for 1 more week. I'm currently overseas where coming back isn't an option unless I wait for my return flight which comes in a week. I don't exactly have the luxury of time to wait until next week to personally hand in my resignation letter, so I'm looking to do it by email. Is there anything I should be aware of? Anything ethics related, or when the notice period starts, and things I could do to smoothen the process? Thanks! 

An individual BCCing anything to the whole company about their personal lives is just not something that should be done. However, in my experience, a picture of a new baby is sent out to everybody in the office in order to accomplish two things. First, everybody's going to ask about the baby and it gets disruptive. Some people are truly interested and some people just feel obligated. The new parent either can't resist getting drawn into long conversations or gets frustrated and overwhelmed. Second, it's a much less heartless-seeming way to announce that an employee may be out of the office for a period or may have an unpredictable schedule, and plans can be shifted to compensate rather than causing all kinds of pile-ups. 

They interviewed you, ask for your feedback then, took your feedback and used it adjust the Job Spec. Basically they are interviewing people to help then figure out what they need - once they know that, they will start seriously interviewing people, maybe. I know this sound malicious, but they just trying to find their way, and simply don't know how to hire for this specific position. In there mind if you are a good fit they will hire you - even if the likelihood of that happening is small, so there is nothing wrong with it. This is very common, though the blatantly asking for feedback before giving you there decision is clearly (at least somewhat) abusive and less common. There's nothing you can do about it, just move on and don't let it upset you. 

in an aggressive tone (for me, and for other employees as well, as she exclaimed this in public) She sent a request to said employee to do task A, and the employee has indeed finished the task according to specifications. I read the request, and I confirmed that he did the job. The root of the issue, she said, is that he didn't do what she asked him to do exactly, basically, miscommunication. In an IT person's head, the job was done. I read it and interpreted it as such where he actually did the job correctly, when she actually meant something else. She has no IT experience (makes me wonder how she became a project manager in the first place, but that's for another topic), so she can't communicate very well with IT staff. What is the problem here, and what should I do? Is it the miscommunication? Her lack of IT knowledge? Or the badmouthing? Should I talk to my supervisor about this, and if so, how should I approach this? 

Yes, I personally would put that under an education section rather than a certification\Skills section. In that section you can list the course name and Completion date. 

Document the policy Attend all events Unpaid - But document your attendance\time. Once you are ready to move on, find a new job and quit. Once you start your new Job, file a complaint with the department of labor and demand back pay for those hours. 

I'm not recommending you do this, but it is an option. (I would just call his bluff a if I get fired so be it.) 

TBH, I think you're both wrong. If your computer use policy is to lock your computer when you're not there, your responsibility is to manually lock your computer. If you're away from your computer and it's logged in and unlocked, for whatever reason, the computer's not the one accountable, you are, so make sure you're the one who ensures that doesn't happen. That being said, that's a relatively widespread and--on its own--harmless office game, but your boss is making an irresponsible decision. He could well be putting himself and all of you at risk. First, he's encouraging behavior that doesn't reinforce good security standards, and that's a bad practice, regardless of the reason. But second, he's actually encouraging his subordinates to use the computers under someone else's identity, which is likely internally punishable by your company's policy and possibly, depending on your organization and your data, illegal. I don't know what you want to do with that information, but that's my viewpoint, based on experience. 

What are the advantages and disadvantages in inviting and accepting all people in your LinkedIn profile? Obviously the advantage is that you'd have a larger circle and you'd be easier to find for employers, but am I missing out on a disadvantage here? 

I found this as one of the more fun aspects of a profile in LinkedIn, however, I wonder if it even matters for employers and recruiters. 

These outbursts are damaging the work environment and may emotionally affect the other employees. The work productivity is most probably affected, and as HR, it is your job to take action to keep your employees at their best possible shape to work productively for the company. You said you talked with him and I think that's great, but if it's still continuing, you have to devise other methods. Maybe he needs a short break from work to calm himself, or some other thing you can think of to improve his situation. But I believe action must be done, and it must be done fast. P.S. Take my advice with a grain of salt as I am no expert in these types of things. :) 

I had a boss who struggled with social niceties like this. It just sort of didn't click with him. I didn't think about it much because he always seemed great at hobnobbing and building real (albeit professional) relationships with people. Then, we had a team member from a big client whom I just couldn't stand. He was obnoxious, boorish, inappropriate... you get the picture. Constantly walking around our office telling appalling stories and, mostly, racist or sexually explicit jokes. I just broke out in a sweat every time he came around and dreaded the thought. I asked my boss for his professional advice, and he said, "[guy]? I love [guy]!" And it struck me, he practiced. Every kind of professional social interaction, he had a mental script for, and he practiced and polished it every day. I realized that deep down, he would never be that kind of guy, but he understood the benefits of contributing to a pro-social workplace, and he considered it part of his job. My animus towards that client just evaporated, and after that, I "loved" it when he came around, too. He was never going to stop saying things that we all knew (and discussed privately) were wholly unacceptable on every level, but if I built a professional relationship with him, then we had things to talk about, and that was something I did have influence over. My stress was gone and I was able to go on to work with him on things. In your case, I'd consider coming up with a few stock phrases--how was your weekend, that commute was something else this morning, that sort of thing. Then, especially for the biggest talkers, try to remember one innocuous personal detail about them that you can ask about in a pinch, like a pet (species only), something specific about a family member (son's upcoming wedding, niece's new job--name is preferable here if you can remember it), or a hobby project in the works. And here's the other part of it. If you have good non-verbal communication, like you look them in the eye, smile, and have a pleasant tone in your voice, then you can get away with jumping on the end of a sentence if they're starting to launch into a story. You smile a little extra, give a little wave, and while you start to walk away, you say, "That sounds so nice! Well, I'll see you later!" and keep going to your desk. 

Additional info : They know I already have signed a contract as I've told them, but they said they still want to go for an interview. 

Additional details : I am from Australia, and it might help if you give examples in Australia's work culture, however, general answers are also accepted since we aim this to be helpful for anyone, not only the ones residing/working in Australia. 

Additional info : I'm planning to leave, in case I can't work under Y directly. So I guess that adds to my negotiating power. 

I've been advised that, if you take non-FMLA leave in conjunction with FMLA leave or if you leave the company while on FMLA leave, the leave may then be considered as non-FMLA, and that it's best to come back at least for one day in order to officially end your FMLA leave and process all your paperwork before any of that other stuff. If you're talking about parental leave given by your company that's not covered under FMLA, it'll depend entirely on your company's policies. 

I would definitely avoid trying to read some meaning into this relating to your performance in your work. If someone's trying to send you messages this way and it's the first you've heard of it, your workplace has much bigger problems than employee social events.
