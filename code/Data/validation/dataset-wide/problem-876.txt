EDIT: Put another way - if density becomes large enough, gravity is so huge, no other force is strong enough to resist it. It just crushes all barriers that matter raises to oppose further crushing. That lump of matter simply crushes itself, its own gravity pulls it together smaller and smaller... and smaller... and so on. According to current theories, there's nothing to stop it (QM might stop it, but we cannot prove it, because we don't have the math). So it just spirals down in a vicious cycle of ever-increasing gravity that increases itself. Space and time are really pathologic inside the event horizon. If you are already inside, there's no way out. This is not because you can't move out fast enough, but because there's really no way out. No matter which way you turn, you're looking towards the central singularity - in both space and time. There is no conceivable trajectory that you could draw, starting from the inside of the event horizon, that leads outside. All trajectories point at the singularity. All your possible futures, if you're inside the event horizon, end at the central singularity. 

Note: I am using jargon in the text above. "Deeper" really means "more strongly curved". "Shallower" really means "less strongly curved". The difference between circle and parabola is that the parabola is more strongly curved in the center, while the curvature at the edge is less strong. The circle has constant curvature everywhere, by definition. This doesn't necessarily mean the center of the mirror is physically more depressed; while doing any strokes, the whole surface keeps being polished down all the time. But the relative curvatures of center vs. edge may change. Deeper vs shallower are terms that reflect the physical process, whether the tool applies more or less pressure on a certain area of the mirror (so polishing goes faster or slower there). But the geometric attribute that the process actually changes, that we are interested in, is the radius of curvature. Where the tool applies more pressure, the radius of the curvature decreases rapidly (the surface becomes more strongly curved). Deeper and shallower are practical terms related to process. More or less strongly curved are theoretical terms related to geometry. When you make mirrors, after a while these terms become linked in your mind. 

Re: the usability issues I'm not sure what to say about the wobble. Hopefully nothing is broken. What you're experiencing is not the narrow exit pupil. At 30x with a 76mm aperture the exit pupil is 2.5mm, which is plenty. Things get difficult below 0.5mm. It's probably a combination of small eye relief and narrow apparent field of view. Eye relief is the optimal distance between the lens and your eye. High end eyepieces have generous amounts of it, e.g. 20mm. Cheaper eyepieces tend to vary, some are fine, others pull the eye relief as close as only a few mm. That's not very comfortable to use, and it's tricky to find the sweet spot. The apparent field of view is the size of the "hole" you're looking through. Not the lens diameter, which has nothing to do with it, but the apparent diameter of the image you see in the lens, from dark edge to dark edge. Some lenses are like looking through a keyhole. Other lenses are like looking through a big porthole on an ocean liner. These two together determine how comfortable an eyepiece is to use. The good news is, once you learn the trick, you can find the sweet spot every time afterwards. 

On what scale? Quite a few nebulae obscure light, but we're talking on the scale of distance between two neighboring stars. There are some nebulae that glow from within but we don't quite see the star - that's an example. If you're talking about blocking light on the scale of mere kilometers, that's not possible "in outer space". Not for nebulae, not for dust clouds or anything else. That would be a density approaching the atmosphere of a planet. Consider the Earth - you can see just fine kilometers away through its atmosphere, unless fog gets in the way. 

Regarding observing human artifacts on the Moon with terrestrial telescopes, I wish it was doable, but it's not. Again the YouTube video is wrong. The biggest telescope accessible to amateurs has an aperture (diameter) in the range of 1 meter or a little bit larger (the aperture of the largest amateur-owned telescopes currently). The resolving power of a telescope (the size of finest details discernible) depends on aperture - if aperture is measured in mm and the resolving power in measured in arcseconds, then the formula is: resolving power = 100 / aperture So a 1 meter telescope has a resolving power of 0.1 arcseconds. The distance from Earth to Moon is 384000 km (3.84 * 10^8 meters). With a resolving power of 0.1 arcseconds, the size of the smallest detail discernible on the Moon is: detail size = distance_from_Earth_to_Moon * arctan(resolving power) or detail size = 3.84 * 10^8 * arctan(0.1 arcsec) = 186 meters Anything smaller than 186 meters would be blurred into a single dot. There's nothing we've done on the Moon that's as big as that. It's not possible to see traces of human activity with amateur-level telescopes, even with extremely large meter-class dobsonian telescopes. Even with professional telescopes, we just don't have the aperture yet to resolve that kind of detail. However, satellites in orbit around the Moon, such as the LRO, were able to image traces of the Apollo missions. That's because they are a lot closer to the site. $URL$ 

Books Mirror making 'How To Make A Telescope' by Jean Texereau has been considered the foundational text of this field for a long time. Definitely read it, but keep in mind it's a little old. $URL$ 'Build Your Own Telescope' by Richard Berry is a little closer to the present day. His choice of materials and procedures may seem a bit more familiar to you. I don't see it as an either/or choice - read both Texereau and Berry. $URL$ Another excellent source of info for mirror making is the Stellafane website. It's an even more modern approach than both of those books, and it's basically the playbook they use at Stellafane in Vermont to help dozens of newbies make their own mirrors every year (with supervision). Last time I checked they were missing the chapters on sphericization and parabolization, but you can get that stuff from Texereau and Berry. $URL$ I highly recommend you read all sources indicated above. Texereau is a classic, a bit old but full of wise advice. Berry is more modern, but it's his own method, it's what worked for him. Stellafane is a very practical approach that's still in use nowadays. In practice, your own method will end up being a blend of all of the above, probably tracking the Stellafane process fairly closely, but with bits and pieces from the other authors too. Telescope making Both Texereau and Berry have some recommendations, but they're very old. Read them for informative purposes but don't follow them. Instead, use Stellafane's guide: $URL$ This is perfect for a 6" to 8" small dobsonian. Later on, if you want to build a larger dobsonian, read the books by David Kriege and Albert Highe: $URL$ $URL$ The Kriege book is a bit older stuff, but he's very experienced (he's the owner of Obsession Telescopes). Highe is an engineer turned amateur telescope maker, and his book goes very deeply into the theory of engineering of such projects; you don't have to understand every single part of it, but it's very informative to just read it and see how he's doing it. 

Both Venus and Mercury are always seen close to the Sun. You can never see them at midnight, true. But you can see them during twilight, or, in Venus' case, shortly after nightfall (and then it sets quickly), or shortly before dawn in the morning (and then it's masked by the light of day). This is not a paradox or an impossibility. Here's why: Mercury in particular can only be seen during twilight, very close to sunset or sunrise. Its orbit is so close to the Sun in space (only 39% the size of Earth's orbit), it does appear very close to the Sun even in the sky as seen from Earth. You could not see it during the day, of course, because the sky is so bright. But during twilight you can sometimes see it peeking just to the side of the Sun, very briefly - then it either sets in the West, or is swallowed by the light of day. The greatest elongation that Mercury can achieve is 28°. Hold your arm straight out in front of you and make a fist; twice the size of your fist is nearly 28°. But even that's quite exceptional; most of the time Mercury stays closer to the Sun, closer than half of that angle (less than one fist). So I should make it very clear: it's very rare that you can actually see Mercury with your naked eyes. It pretty much has to be right at maximum elongation. I've observed its phases (just like the Moon, or Venus) in a small dobsonian telescope a couple times; at max elongation it's close to the first quarter phase, or last quarter, and it looks like a very tiny replica of the Moon seen at that same phase. Kind of like this (except in my small telescope no craters or mountains were visible, because the image was just too tiny): 

Then there's the core collapse supernova, where a star is simply too bloated and too old to sustain enough pressure in the core; the core collapses into itself due to gravity and re-ignites fusion, effectively exploding like a bomb and ejecting the outer layers: 

You don't. It's out of OU, it's gone. Completely and forever. Just let it go cause it ain't coming back. 

You will definitely see some sunspots at 10x; in exceptional cases sunspots are big enough to be visible with the naked eye through the sunset haze near horizon, but many sunspots are visible in a small instrument like a 10x binoc with proper filtering. The Sun is at low activity right now, but still a few sunspots are showing up once in a while. And the activity should increase gradually in the future. Planetary transits - yes. However, the next transit of Venus will take place in a century or so. Mercury transits more often, and the filters will allow you to see it - a tiny dot on the face of the Sun. A bit higher magnification might be beneficial, but anyway even at 10x you should see the planet, even if it's rather small. BTW, I recommend solar filters based on the Baader solar filter film (just google it). They are neutral-density (do not change the color of the image), and are recommended and have been tested with instruments from small binocs to dobsonian telescopes. Make sure the filters are firmly attached to the instrument, and are free of defects. 

UV is stopped in the upper atmosphere. X rays are absorbed by the whole atmosphere, and are pretty weak anyway. The Sun's EM activity in terms of harsh radiation increases greatly if there's a solar flare blowing up. Even then, we're pretty safe on Earth. High energy particles The solar wind is basically a flux of particles (nuclei of hydrogen, etc) shooting out of the Sun at pretty high energies. These are charged particles. When approaching the Earth, the Earth's magnetic field for the most part deflects them. If you're on Earth, you're safe. Even in space, the flux is not very great; you'd be safe inside a spacecraft. 

Well, that's it. Do some more research on your own, then make a decision. Don't forget that learning only begins with the moment you acquire the scope. Above all, have fun, and keep looking up. Clear skies to you! 

Light pollution Observing from the city, DSOs are challenging. The further away you are from city lights, the better your views. Deserts, national parks, sparsely populated areas are all good. Driving at least 1 hour away from the city usually provides very noticeable improvements. Light pollution maps help in finding places with a dark sky. $URL$ $URL$ Aperture The bigger the aperture, the better you can see DSOs. If you're a DSO hunter, you must be focused on increasing aperture before you do anything else. What helps here is having an instrument with a good aperture / cost ratio, such as a dobsonian reflector. There's essentially no limit here - more is always better. It should be noted that a larger aperture will always perform better than a smaller one, even when light pollution is very heavy - but of course it's best if both aperture and dark sky cooperate. 

You've pretty much answered it yourself. Very large telescopes are expensive to build, and there are diminishing returns for large instruments operating under Earth's atmosphere. Air turbulence (what is known as "seeing") limits the resolving power of the telescope - its ability to distinguish small details and make high resolution images. It's an essentially random phenomenon, so sometimes it gets better, but generally speaking large instruments are more strongly affected by turbulence. Light pollution is the glow caused by all artificial light sources (city lights, industrial lights), which are making it difficult to see very faint, very distant objects. It is drowning the faint objects in artificial glow. The bigger the telescope is, the better its resolving power, and the better its light gathering ability (the ability to see faint objects). But seeing and light pollution are affecting both. You could fight seeing with adaptive optics, with decent results. You could fight light pollution by installing the instrument far from cities. Or you could fight both by launching the instrument into space. All these solutions cost money. Large instruments are expensive. Adaptive optics are expensive. Running an observatory in the middle of nowhere also adds costs. Finally, launching things into space is not cheap either. However, each one of these methods is used in one case or another. For each kind of application, astronomers need to make a decision for what methods they could use to improve performance, and then match that up with the money available to the project. It's a complex overall decision that takes a long time, lots of discussions, often politics gets involved, etc. So what gets built is a compromise between what astronomers want, and what is actually doable from a financial, political, and technological standpoint. 

It's complicated, and it depends on what you mean by "black hole". In general, for a distant observer, the "black hole" is the event horizon - the surface within which there is no escape to the outside. The more massive the black hole, the bigger the event horizon. $URL$ If the black hole is not rotating, the event horizon is a sphere, plain and simple. In a perfect vacuum, and if the black hole is big enough (is not microscopic), looking at it you'll see a perfectly black, round "thing", with the stellar background behind it. 

(1) is very doable. The others don't seem doable, at least not easily. If you practice astrophotography for a while you'll have a better understanding of the difficulties involved. It's best (but not mandatory) if you begin doing plain visual astronomy, with something like an 8" dobsonian, for a year or two, to get yourself familiarized with how it all works. Once that's accomplished, the transition to astrophotography should be easier. For AP (astrophotography) you'll need: a mount, a camera, a telescope. The mount is by far the most important. The camera is very important. Oddly enough, the telescope is the least important. The accuracy, overall quality, and load carrying capacity of the mount will determine how well the whole system works. Just get the best mount you can afford. Entry level mount examples: Celestron CGEM, Sky-Watcher EQ6. Midrange mounts: Losmandy High-end mounts: Software Bisque Paramount, Astro-Physics GTO 

This is a very complex question, and perhaps more appropriate for the Physics or Philosophy stacks. I will attempt to give you an initial direction, but really I think this is too broad for this stack. I'm merely writing here because comments are too short. In a very practical way, space is simply that which allows objects and events to have relative position, direction, and extent. There is still disagreement over whether space is a thing in itself, or merely a relationship between things, or part of a conceptual framework. See wiki In relativity, the dominant concept is not space, but spacetime - closely related to a fundamental constant of the universe (speed of light) and to gravity. Space itself, or time itself, are less important, but the 4-dimensional metric of spacetime is far more fundamental, in a sense.
