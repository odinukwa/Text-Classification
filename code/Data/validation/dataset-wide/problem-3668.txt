Everything being ideal, you might expect to lose 6 lbs of fat and put on 3 lbs of muscle. To achieve this, you’ll want to do some LISS cardio (ie taking a long walk) everyday as well as doing strength training and HIIT cardio. You’ll also want to eat in a (roughly estimated) 300 calorie deficit off of your TDEE, and get plenty of protein (maybe up to 1 gram per pound). Supplementing with Creatine may also give a slight boost to muscle mass appearance, so that may be worth a shot for that alone , but beyond that it will also help to improve performance.

It depends entirely on the exertion given and how much demand is being made on the muscles. The more you exert yourself, the more calories you will burn. You'll also create the opportunity for hypertrophy, which in itself burns calories. Therefore, the harder the work, the more fat loss you will see from it. I should reiterate that your diet will be the primary concern here however. 

Larger hands will naturally produce stronger forearms. Because many muscles in the forearms are connected to the hands and fingers, larger hands will inevitably lend themselves to larger forearms, and a larger muscle will almost always be a stronger muscle. Genetics are just a luck of the draw, but luckily they aren't the only thing that determines our physiques/strength levels. With training and working hard to be consistent with that training you can often times outperform someone who is gifted, but not dedicated. 

I would suggest training five days a week and doing fewer calories. A simple rule of thumb for building muscle is that under good-ideal conditions a man can build 1-2 lbs (.45-.90kg) of muscle per month, while a woman can do half of that. If you are gaining more weight than that, it will be fat. To monitor this more closely, divide that number by four and check your weight gain each week. Thus, your goal weight gain (if you are a man) should not exceed 0.5 lbs (.22kg) a week. 

Your TDEE honestly sounds like it should be higher (2200 from what you’ve described is a cut). Also, stick with the same amount of calories each day, cutting every other day is silly. As far as intermittent fasting goes, if it works for you that’s fine, keep doing it. If it doesn’t, then don’t do it. It doesn’t seem to make any difference from the research that draws a fair comparison. 1.) It’s not a beneficial idea at the very least. When aren’t exercising, your muscles are recovering and rebuilding themselves. You want to provide your body with the fuel necessary to make the most of that recovery process. 2.) RPT and High Volume Training are great for building muscular endurance (a type of strength), but they aren’t as beneficial towards explosive strength and increasing one rep maxes. Something like a five rep set (near or to failure) would be better suited towards building a higher one rep max, and a 10-12 rep set (near or to failure) strikes a balance between endurance and max strength. 

3.) Cardio won’t make you lose your gains. Doing HIIT two days a week (sandwiched between your strength days) would be beneficial. Or instead of generic HIIT routines, you could do anything that gets your heart rate up (sports, hiking, swimming, etc). You could also do LISS everyday if you have time for it. Something like a walk in the park, or a nature trail for an hour or more. Regardless, cardio of any form can help to shed fat (and it’s more likely to just be fat if you are feeding yourself properly and doing strength training). 

This honestly just sounds like a case of DOMS. What is that? “Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness”, it’s a side effect training muscles more than normal. DOMS is a sign that your muscles are breaking down, and if you provide your body with sufficient protein, then they will rebuild themselves to be stronger and bigger. DOMS is not necessary for muscle growth, but it can be a friendly reminder. How do you get rid of DOMS? When your muscles have been sufficiently rebuilt, the soreness will pass. DOMS is not a sign to stop working out however, it’s perfectly normal. Pain on the other hand is a sign to stop working out. If you suddenly feel a sharp pain while working out (or during physical activity), it is possible that you could have strained a muscle, and a strained muscle needs rest. It may be hard to distinguish between the two as a beginner, but try to gauge whether the muscles feel exhausted and “weak”, or compromised and painful. Nutrition and rest are key to recovery though. As far as rest goes, try to limit your workouts to an hour or less per day, 5 days per week. As far as nutrition goes, try to consume 1.5-2.0 times your kg body weight in grams of protein, this will ensure that your body has plenty to work with. Your balance of fats and carbs isn’t too important as long as you are eating from healthy sources and eating a reasonable number of calories for your goals (see a TDEE Calculator). Supplements exist to supplement your diet in areas that you might be missing out on. The most useful supplements are Protein Powders, Omega 3s, Multivitamins, and Creatine. Double check your diet though and do your own research to determine how much of each you will want/need (no supplement is 100% necessary, but they are certainly beneficial). Finally, ensure that you are following a competent fitness plan. Following a well thought out plan created by someone who knows what they are doing will ensure that your muscles have time to recover and grow between workouts. Not only that, but it will also ensure that you are making the most out of the time you spend working out. Good luck! 

$URL$ From that article, here is a list of all the exercises that were mentioned. Each group of exercises were designed by different experts. 

Jeff Cavalier over on YouTube focuses on doing exactly that. He has a plethora of free videos that may be found there, and he also has a variety of programs which may be purchased on his website. He’s got a background as a physical therapist and believes in training the body both athletically and functionally. Check him out and see if that’s what you are looking for. 

This is an anatomy question more than anything, but in the context of fitness here is a look at both as a brief overview. The biceps are a muscle group consisting of two “heads” on the front of the arm, they are responsible for many pulling movements. The triceps are a muscle group consisting of three “heads” on the back of the arm, they are responsible for many pushing movements. 

Two people of equal builds will burn the same amount of calories doing the same activity regardless of age. A younger person will have more metabolic activity and therefore burn more calories DURING the activity, but a younger person will still burn the same amount of calories FROM the activity. If you noticed, there are two caveats to that conclusion. The first is that my conclusion requires the two hypothetical people to be of the same build, which isn’t common even among people in the same age group, there is a ton of diversity among people. The second is that the two people are doing the same activity, which might sound cut and dry, but it isn’t. Two people could go for a mile walk and one could work harder simply because their legs are shorter. Two people could lift a 10 lb dumbbell and one work harder because they have less muscle mass. Age itself isn’t a factor for the calories burned from an activity, but it can effect other things that are factors (height, strength, stamina, etc). 

As for your training regimen three days of strength training is fine, but if it were me, I would toss some HIIT cardio in twice a week as well. Will cardio kill your gains? No, but your diet might. Why toss in two days of cardio? It's good for fat loss, endurance, and heart health for starters, but it will also help to balance out all that strength training as well as give you something to do between strength days. As a side note, you can do some quick (5-10 minutes) abwork every day if you want to build abs, they recovery quickly. They don't necessarily need to be done exclusively on strength training days. Finally, if lack of energy at the gym is/has been a problem for you, you will want to determine the cause. Are you getting enough sleep/rest in general? Rest and recovery is vital to building muscles. Are you spending too much time in the gym? Overtraining is a real thing, but as a rule of thumb, try to spend less than an hour in the gym when you're there (it's entirely possible to get a great workout done in under half an hour). Is your diet not giving you the energy you need? It might just be that you're not used to it, but it may be that you're under eating or simply not eating the nutrients that you need. If you seem to be good in all of these areas, but you still don't have enough energy, that is what preworkout supplements are made for. Try using those for better results. 

It seems like a straight-forward progression to and past failure to me. You start with Incline Barbell Press (medium difficulty), then you do Incline Dumbbell Press (harder difficulty), then you do Regular Barbell/Bench Press (easier difficulty). So basically, the incline press is the focus of the exercise with the flat press added on as a means to keep going. If you are working your muscles to (or close to) failure, then you shouldn't have much left in the tank when you get to the flat press. The flat press then is a way to go "beyond failure". Why the dumbbell press in the middle? Well, it challenges the arms individually and is harder because of that. Maybe the exercise asks for a neutral grip? Dumbbell bench press does have the benefit of being able to change grips. Technically speaking, it should be the same exercise (if using the same grip), but it may just be a way of doing the same thing in a different way. It may also be a coordination thing. I have no idea really, but I can imagine several potential reasons. 

Yes, facial muscles are capable of growing. However, training them is different from standard strength training. Because of their location and function, it can be hard give them a good challenge without some know-how. A quick google search of "training facial muscles" will yield some examples of such exercises. Because the training style will differ from traditional strength training, you should expect differing results with the muscles in your face. Which is to say that it will take longer for them to grow, and their growth potential is smaller than your bigger muscles. It should however be noted that their small size and placement actually makes the small changes in size ironically more notable. 

“I need to understand what those articles mean” They are generalizing. It’s a true statement, just not an accurate one. “and why,” Either to keep it simple, or because they don’t know. “so I could calculate my calories and protein intake correctly.” For Protein, you want to consume 1.5-2.0 times your kg body weight in grams of protein. You can do more if you want, but the benefits of doing so aren’t clear. As for calories in general? Closely monitor ALL of your calories for a week and make sure to eat the same amount every day. At the end of the week, weigh yourself. If you lost weight, add 500 calories and repeat the experiment. If you maintained, add 250 calories and repeat the experiment. If you gain too much, just cut back. Your goal weight gain should be 0-0.5 lbs per week, if you’re gaining more than that, it’s probably fat. As a general rule, a human male can only build 1-2 lbs of muscle a month, while a female can build 0.5-1 lb a month. For best results, plan out your meals ahead of time and utilize “MyFitnessPal”, as well as making sure that you follow a competent workout program. You’ll save yourself A LOT of time and misery by listening to someone who knows what they are doing. Yes, it can be pricey, but it is more than worth it. A program that I would suggest is “ATHLEAN-X”, but any reputable program will work. Good luck! 

No, 50 grams certainly isn’t enough to build muscle, and it may not even be enough to maintain good health, not unless you are especially small (minimum is 0.8 grams per kg of body weight). Doing more protein for three days isn’t going to offset the malnourishment enough to start building muscle. Bottom line, you need more protein. I’m not sure what reasons are preventing you from having more throughout the week, but protein is easily accessible. There are cheap options (tuna, eggs, bulk quantities of whey), vegan options (soy), and options for pretty much anything really. 

According to the charts linked below, you should expect yourself to be able to bench press between 74 and 110 lbs as your one rep max. When doing sets, you’ll be doing less weight. You will be “outclassed” because she’s clearly put in some work and had time to build lean muscle. You’ll basically be starting fresh, so that makes sense though. As a word of advice, avoid “ego lifting” and try to learn proper form first and foremost. Then, as you become comfortable with the movement patterns, pick a challenging weight when you are ready to do sets. Just don’t go too heavy or too light (to the point where it isn’t challenging), neither of those two options are beneficial. (Note that "Too Heavy" is defined by you not being able to do the exercise in proper form and "Too Light" is defined by a lack of muscular engagement. The middle ground between the two that you are looking for is when your muscles are "challenged".) Related - A quick way to find that ideal challenge level is to do a single rep with various weights, starting light and adding more as you feel comfortable. You will find this to be the case with the various exercises that you incorporate into your routine. Try to take notes (mental or otherwise) and remember what weights were challenging for you. That way, the next time you go to work out, you'll be ready to make the most of it from the start. $URL$
