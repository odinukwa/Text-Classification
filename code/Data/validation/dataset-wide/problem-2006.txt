Last week I went to a conference where I met a very interesting company, they quickly showed their interest in me and quickly on the spot offered me an opportunity that i'm really excited about and during that day I had 4 meetings with their top management. During one of the meetings, I was discussing the opportunity with one of the senior managers and later on he asked me about my current salary, I quickly responded with the exact number not a range "my horrible mistake" I was trying to be honest and then move to ask for a higher package but before I continue he told me that he has no problem with that number I was trying to take the initiative to negotiate but suddenly -since it's a conference- one of his friends interrupted the discussion and sat on our table and quickly asked him to join their dinner. I was confused and didn't know what should I do, i felt uneasy to discuss salary in-front of that person so I didn't even try. At the moment, I'm confused and not sure what to do, I'm sure they gonna offer me the exact same salary though I want to negotiate more since I don't feel I had my chance to negotiate but at the same time I'm worried they take negativity and I lose that amazing opportunity. I have reached out to the same senior manager and asked him for another meeting regarding the opportunity. My questions are: 

I have been working in a similar culture for the past two years and based on my experience i would say it's hard to stop these things from happening if you don't speak up they simply assume this is what you are looking for in one way or another. Usually whenever i have such business meetings overseas, i fill my schedule outside office hours with activities i enjoy, sightseeing, museums, shopping ...etc whatever is interesting to you, I keep a slot for a dinner the first day or two since most likely they will offer a dinner after work, after dinner if they come up with a plan that i don't feel comfortable with i tell them that i'm busy doing XXX and ask them to join if they want to, once you repeat this pattern for 3-5 times, they tend to understand what is interesting to you and slowly they will start to come up with things that you really wanna see/do. At the end, keep in mind they are doing their effort to make you feel good and enjoy your trip, so you just need to give them some hints on what you really like. 

That is so so so soooo wrong! Answering a professional question that you have no clue about, without doing any research, is actually the unprofessional thing to do here. Telling someone I will research on this and get back to you is one of the most appropriate responses you can have. If I was the interviewer or even your boss and I was certain that what I asked is not everyday knowledge that you should already know, I would be pleased with your response. 

Set the alarm after the regular office time is over. Everyone who stays in office after that and has to go out must disable the alarm and then set it again before leaving. Following this protocol will ensure the alarm is always set and there is no guesswork involved whether someone else is still in the building or not. Yes it is a little extra hassle for everyone to do it but it ensures its set always. Neither does it cost you an extra dime nor does it rely on guesswork. 

Please take this F-16 and transport 500 People 2000 Miles away tonight. If you can't, that means F-16 is slow! Yeah right! That's the logic your boss is using. If transporting 500 people is so important to him, he should charter an airliner, if he refuses to do that and F-16 fails to do what he wants that doesn't make that F-16 bad. Find the most hardworking dump truck ( 10 Ton) driver ever and ask him to shift a mine load of coal (300 T) overnight in 5 runs 100 miles away otherwise you'll lose a deal; You sure will! Your boss is trying to use a Serial cable for Parallel output expectations, It's his fault his headache to deal with. If a boss is not willing to provide adequate resources to get the job done its him to blame regardless of what you're told. If the deals were so important, he should have arranged to gather enough resources to get it done. You can't go to moon on even the best helicopter in the whole world. It's his management that will cause the loss, not your work. Such a company is bound to go under, today or tomorrow, with or without you. Don't sweat. 

Andy's picture that you have painted clearly makes me believe that if Andy had heard that conversation, you would not be sitting here guessing whether he did. You would have received a call back right there. So, don't worry :) And that is the recommended practice at least in our culture, cross the bridge when it arrives.
