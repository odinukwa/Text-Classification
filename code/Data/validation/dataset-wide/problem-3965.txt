Obviously this does not answer the question, but you might gain some intuition by plotting curves of this type. 

In the ordinary homotopy category, the groups $A_k^n=\pi_k(S^n)/(\text{odd torsion})$ are linked by the EHP exact sequence $$ A_k^n \xrightarrow{E} A_{k+1}^{n+1} \xrightarrow{H} A_{k+1}^{2n+1} \xrightarrow{P} A^n_{k-1} $$ It is not hard to show that if $A$ and $B$ are two bigraded groups which each have an EHP sequence, and $f\colon A\to B$ is a morphism that is compatible with the EHP maps, and $f\colon A^1_1\to B^1_1$ is an isomorphism, then $f\colon A\to B$ is an isomorphism. (Perhaps we need the edge condition $A_k^1=B_k^1=0$ for $k>1$ as well.) There is a similar but more complex story for odd primes. Thus, a central question is whether one can define an EHP sequence in any $(\infty,1)$ topos. A closely related question is whether one can define an EHP sequence in any model of homotopy type theory; I am not sure about the exact relationship between these two formulations. Key ingredients include 

One thing you can try is to select numerical values for $a$ and $b$ (say $a=b=1$ or $a=b^{-1}=2$) and then find a power series solution $y=1+\sum_{k>0}c_k(x-1)^k$ and inspect the coefficients $c_k$. With $a=b=1$ they are $$ 3, 2, 4, 11, 35, \frac{721}{6}, \frac{18163}{42}, \frac{540391}{336}, \frac{98091}{16}, \frac{26684211}{1120},\dotsc $$ If there was a straightforward solution in terms of standard functions then you would expect that the coefficients would be arithmetically simple, with no large primes involved in $c_k$ when $k$ is small. (Large primes can appear in the numerator by accident, but not so easily in the denominator.) Also, the terms $k!c_k$ seem to be integers, so we can look them up in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. In fact, the prime $286927$ appears in the numerator of $c_{10}$ and OEIS does not recognise the sequence $k!c_k$ so that is not promising for the existence of an elementary solution. 

The simplest example is just $x\boxplus y=x+y$ and $x\boxtimes y=-xy$. This gives a ring structure with $-1$ as the multiplicative identity. The map $x\mapsto -x$ gives an isomorphism $(\mathbb{Q},\boxplus,\boxtimes)\simeq(\mathbb{Q},+,\times)$. 

For each vertex $v$ and each $\beta\leq\alpha$, one can show by induction on $\beta$ that $\{f_\phi(v):\phi\leq\beta\}$ is finite. Using this, we see that for each finite subcomplex $F\subset K$, the restrictions $f_0|_F$ and $f_\alpha|_F$ are contiguous in the usual sense and therefore homotopic. However, this is not in general enough to conclude that $f_0$ and $f_\alpha$ are homotopic. In the case where $|L|$ is a homotopy commutative $H$-space and $K$ is the union of a chain of finite based subcomplexes $F_n$, we have a Milnor exact sequence $$ 0 \to \lim{}^1_n [\Sigma |F_n|,|L|] \to [|K|,|L|] \to \lim{}_n [|F_n|,|L|] \to 0 $$ If I remember correctly, the $\lim^1$ term is nonzero (and very large) when $|K|=\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ and $|L|=S^3$. It is not clear to me whether one can choose triangulations and simplicial approximations in such a way as to convert this to a counterexample to your original question, but it seems like the right place to look. 

Let $U$ be the matrix which sends $e_i$ to $e_{2i}$ and $e_{i+n}$ to $e_{2i+1}$ for $0\leq i<n$. Then $f(X)=Ug(X)U^{-1}$. You can join $U$ to $I$ by a path in $U(n)$, and this gives a homotopy between $f$ and $g$. 

On the linguistic question: I would say "While attending a lecture on homotopy theory, the following question occurred to me." On the mathematical question: I think you need only prove that $S(u+v)=S(u)+S(v)$ when $(X,u,v)$ is the universal example of a based space with two based maps $u,v:S^k\to X$, ie $(X,u,v)=(S^k\vee S^k,i_1,i_2)$. Here $X$ is well-pointed so there is no problem. 

Here is a question which (up to some translation) I have been asked by an electrical engineer. Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to[0,1]$ be a smooth function with $f(x+1)=f(x)$. I would like to approximate $f$ in some sense by a characteristic function $\chi_A$, where $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ is also $\mathbb{Z}$-periodic. The idea is that $A$ should be a disjoint union of very short intervals, such that for any moderately short interval $J$ centred at $x$, the measure of $A\cap J$ should be close to $f(x)$ times the length of $J$. One possibility is to fix a large integer $N$ and put $$ A = \bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{Z}} [k/N,(k+f(k/N))/N], $$ but more complicated schemes could also be used. The quality of approximation should probably be measured by a norm of the form $$ \|g\| = \left(\sum_n a_n|c_n(g)|^2 \right)^{1/2}, $$ where $c_n(g)$ is the $n$'th Fourier coefficient, and the $a_n$ are positive constants depending on the application. Is there any literature on this kind of question? 

This is more of an extended comment than an answer. Let me write $M(U)$ for the space of measures on $U$, and $D(U)$ for the space of distributions. If $V\subseteq U$ we can certainly define a restriction map $M(U)\to M(V)$, and I think this makes $M$ a sheaf, or at least it satisfies the sheaf axiom for finite covers. Moreover, if $\mu\in M(U)$ and $f\in C(V)$ has compact support and $f^U\in C(U)$ is the extension by zero then $\langle\mu|_V,f\rangle=\langle\mu,f^U\rangle$; this links the sheaf structure of $M$ to that of $C$, and we can exploit it using partitions of unity. There is a similar story for $D$ and $C^\infty$. I guess that some analogue of this would qualify as an "internal" description of $H(U)^*$. However, the theory would have a very different flavour because the restriction maps $H(U)\to H(V)$ are injective (provided that $U$ is connected), there is no obvious way to define restriction maps for $H(U)^*$, and there is no obvious analogue of the compact support condition, because holomorphic functions of compact support are zero. As a more direct example for your original question, note that Cauchy's integral theorem says that for every nullhomotopic closed curve in $U$, we have a measure concentrated on that curve which is orthogonal to all holomorphic functions. 

Take $X=\prod_{n=0}^\infty S^1$ with $d(x,y)=\sum_n|x_n-y_n|/2^n$. Then the metric topology is the same as the product topology, which is compact by Tychonov. There is an obvious group structure by pointwise multiplication, and multiplication by any fixed element is an isometry, so the space is isometrically homogeneous. It is path-connected but not locally contractible. More generally, I guess you can take any sequence of compact isometrically homogeneous spaces $X_n$, rescale the metric so that $d(x,y)\leq 2^{-n}$ for all $x,y\in X_n$, and then take $X=\prod_nX_n$ with $d(x,y)=\sum_nd(x_n,y_n)$. 

(I should mention that Mark Behrens has independently worked out most of the ideas mentioned in the remainder of the talk that I linked to, with much more success than I had.) 

This is just an amplification of the comments. Framed bordism is about manifolds $M$ equipped with a framing of the stable normal bundle. It takes some work to spell out carefully exactly what that means. However, if we have an embedding $i\colon M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ then we get a bundle $\nu_i$ whose fibre at $x\in M$ is the orthogonal complement to $i_*(T_xM)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and a trivialization $\phi$ of $\nu_i$ certainly gives rise to a stable normal framing. Now suppose that $\partial W=M$ and that $j\colon W\to\mathbb{R}^n$ extends $i$, and that $\psi$ is a trivialization of $\nu_j$. For any point $x\in M$ we have an inward-pointing unit vector $u_x$ that lies in $j_*(T_xW)$ but is orthogonal to $j_*(T_xM)$. Suppose that for all such $x$, the ordered basis $\phi(x)$ consists of $\psi(x)$ followed by $u_x$. In this case, the triple $(W,j,\psi)$ gives rise to a nullbordism of $(M,i,\phi)$. The nontrivial one-dimensional framed bordism class is represented by the circle together with a suitable stable normal framing. If we let $i_1$ denote the usual embedding of $S^1$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and let $\phi_1(z)$ denote the outward pointing unit vector at $i_1(z)$, then this gives the required framing. We can also put $i_2(z)=(i_1(z),0)\in\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\phi_2(z)=(\phi_1(z),(0,0,1))$; the pair $(i_2,\phi_2)$ then represents the same stable normal framing as $(i_1,\phi_1)$. Now let $W$ be the top half of a torus which cuts across the $xy$-plane orthogonally, so $\partial W$ consists of two disjoint circles in the $xy$-plane, and let $j\colon W\to\mathbb{R}^3$ be the inclusion. Then $\nu_j$ is one-dimensional and has an obvious "outward-pointing" trivialization $\psi$. This gives a nullbordism of two copies of $(S^1,i_2,\phi_2)$, as required. 

I think the best available statement is as follows. Suppose that $E$ and $F$ have the property that whenever $F\wedge X=0$ we also have $F\wedge L_EX=0$. (This holds if $L_E$ is smashing, for example when $E$ is the Johnson-Wilson spectrum $E(n)$.) Then there is a natural homotopy pullback square $$ \begin{array}{ccc} L_{E\vee F}X & \rightarrow & L_EX \\\\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\\\ L_FX & \rightarrow & L_EL_FX \end{array} $$ Note that $L_{E\wedge F}X$ does not occur here. Probably the most important example is where $E=E(n-1)$ and $F=K(n)$ so $E\vee F$ is Bousfield equivalent to $E(n)$ but $E\wedge F=0$ and also $L_FL_E=0$ (but $L_EL_F\neq 0$). For another important example, we can take $E=S\mathbb{Q}$ and $F=S/p$ so $E\vee F$ is Bousfield equivalent to $S_{(p)}$. In this case $L_{E\vee F}X=X_{(p)}$ and $L_EX=X\mathbb{Q}$ and $L_FX=X^\wedge_p$ and $L_EL_FX=(X^\wedge_p)\mathbb{Q}$. This gives the $p$-local arithmetic fracture square. For the global arithmetic fracture square, take $F=S(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ (which is Bousfield equivalent to $\bigvee_pS/p$) instead. I think that these ideas are all due to Mike Hopkins, but I don't remember what is the best place to read about them. I think there is a good paper by Mark Hovey. 

The space $\Omega BG$ is, by categorical nonsense, a classifying space for principal $G$-bundles over $\Sigma X$ with a chosen trivialisation at the basepoint. Any such bundle can be trivialised over the upper and lower halves of $\Sigma X$, and the difference between the two trivialisations gives a map $X\to G$. One can show using this that $G$ represents the same functor as $\Omega BG$, so they are homotopy equivalent. (We probably want to assume here that $G$ has the homotopy type of a CW complex). In fact, this line of argument gives a map $G\to\Omega BG$ that is well-defined and natural up to homotopy. This should be enough to show that $\Omega(f_*)$ is a homotopy equivalence, and thus that $\pi_*(f_*)$ is an isomorphism, so $f_*$ is a weak equivalence. 

Here are some preliminary results. Let $F$ be freely generated by $x$ and $y$, let $N\leq F$ be generated by all squares of commutators, and put $G=F/N$. We are interested in the structure of $G$ and $G'$. For $i,j\in\mathbb{Z}$ put $z_{ij}=[x^i,y^j]$ (which might be interepreted as an element of $F$ or $G$). I believe that $F'$ is generated by the elements $z_{ij}$ subject only to $z_{0j}=z_{i0}=1$, so $G'$ is also generated by the $z_{ij}$. In $G$ we have $z_{ij}^2=1$, but there are extra relations as well. First, as $z_{ij}^2=z_{kl}^2=1$ we see that $[z_{ij},z_{kl}]=(z_{ij}z_{kl})^2$, and the square of this must be trivial, so $(z_{ij}z_{kl})^4=1$. If we could improve this to $(z_{ij}z_{kl})^2=1$ then we would see that $G'$ is abelian. In $F$ one can check that $z_{ip}z_{jp}^{-1}=[x^{i-j},x^jy^p]$, so in $G$ we have $(z_{ip}z_{jp}^{-1})^2=1$ as well as $z_{ip}^2=z_{jp}^2=1$. From this it follows easily that $z_{ip}$ commutes with $z_{jp}$. Similarly, we see that $z_{mi}$ commutes with $z_{mj}$. Along the same lines, one can check that $$ [x^iy^j,x^ky^l] = z_{ij}\;z_{i+k,j}^{-1}\;z_{i+k,l}\;z_{k,l}^{-1} $$ so the square of the right hand side is the identity. Adjacent terms on the right hand side commute in $G$ by the two rules that we have already established. This feels like it is getting close, but I am not sure what to do next. 

I have a field $K$ of transcendence degree two over $\mathbb{R}$, and elements $a_1,a_2,a_3\in K$. I would like to understand the set $$ Q = \{ u\in K^3 : \sum_i a_iu_i^2 = 1\} $$ In particular, I would like to know whether it is nonempty, and if so, I would like to find some examples of elements, and ideally some kind of formula for all elements. What general methods are known for this sort of question? My gut feeling is that $Q$ is likely to be empty for most choices of the parameters $a_i$; are there any theorems of that type? Specifically, I am interested in the following case: \begin{align*} r &= y_2^3+(5y_1-9)y_2^2/5+(-20y_1+4y_1^2+24-16y_4)y_2/25-4(1-y_1)/25 \\ A &= \mathbb{R}[y_1,y_4,y_2]/(r) \\ K &= \text{field of fractions of } A \\ a_1 &= y_2(1-y_1-y_2) \\ a_2 &= y_4 \\ a_3 &= y_2. \end{align*} Note that $A$ is a free module of rank three over the subring $A_1=\mathbb{R}[y_1,y_4]$, so $K$ is a free module of rank three over the purely transcendental subfield $K_1=\mathbb{R}(y_1,y_4)$. Using this, we could translate the question to one about a quadratic form in nine variables over $K_1$, which might or might not be more tractable. 

If $X$ is a product of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces then the map $$ \eta^*\colon \pi_2(X) = [S^2,X]\to[S^3,X]=\pi_3(X) $$ is easily seen to be zero (where $\eta\colon S^3\to S^2$ is the Hopf map). However, standard calculations give: \begin{align*} \pi_2(QS^0) & =\pi_2^S(S^0)=\mathbb{Z}/2.\eta^2\\ \pi_3(QS^0) &= \pi_3^S(S^0)=\mathbb{Z}/24.\nu \end{align*} with $\eta^3=12\nu$. Thus, $\eta^*$ is nonzero in this context. 

This worried me a lot when I started using Agda, but I got used to it. I expect that the issues in Coq are similar. The basic point is that one should not think of equality as being so important. In classical mathematics equality is very basic, and we routinely use quotient sets to replace the statement "$a$ is equivalent to $b$" by the apparently simpler statement that the equivalence class of $a$ is equal to the equivalence class of $b$. However, in a constructive framework this is not very natural. You need to keep hold of the equivalence relation and remember the proof that $a\sim b$ as an additional piece of data which can itself be fed into other functions and so on. Most of the time you end up working with "setoids", ie sets equipped with a specified equivalence relation; very few interesting mathematical structures can be constructed without an equivalence relation creeping in somewhere. After a while you get used to the idea that equality is not much better than other equivalence relations. So you can introduce extensional equality as a new equivalence relation, and not worry about the fact that it is different from the intensional version. 

This kind of issue is handled carefully in mathematical treatments of lambda calculus (which is just the abstract version of Lisp). The Wikipedia page on lambda calculus has some discussion of this under 'capture-avoiding substitutions'. I've not worked through it in detail but I don't think that anything very subtle comes up, you just need a rigorous formulation of what it means for a variable to be bound and the sense in which bound variables can harmlessly be renamed. 

The main point is this. Let $(L_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ be another increasing sequence of compact sets whose interiors cover $X$. Each $X_n$ is compact and contained in the union of the sets $\text{int}(L_k)$, so it is contained in some finite union of these open sets. As the sets $\text{int}(L_k)$ are nested, it follows that $K_n\subseteq\text{int}(L_{k_n})\subseteq L_{k_n}$ for some index $k_n$. Moreover, we can assume that $k_n < k_{n+1}$. Similarly, there is an increasing sequence of indices $n_k$ such that $L_k\subseteq\text{int}(K_{n_k})\subseteq K_{n_k}$ for all $k$. Now each component of $X\setminus L_{k_n}$ is contained in a unique component of $X\setminus K_n$, and each component of $X\setminus K_{n_k}$ is contained in a unique component of $X\setminus L_k$. This gives maps $\pi_0(X\setminus L_{k_n})\to\pi_0(X\setminus K_n)$ and $\pi_0(X\setminus K_{n_k})\to\pi_0(X\setminus L_k)$, which can be assembled to give a bijection between the set of ends defined using $K_{*}$ and the set of ends defined using $L_{*}$. 

The relationship between the derived category of $M_{FG}$ and the stable homotopy category $\mathcal{S}$ is somewhat like the relationship between $D(gr_I(R))$ and $D(R)$, where $R$ is a commutative ring, and $I$ is an ideal in $R$, and $gr_I(R)=\bigoplus_nI^n/I^{n+1}$ is the associated graded ring. Complex cobordism gives a homological functor from $\mathcal{S}$ to the abelian category of quasicoherent sheaves on $M_{FG}$, but there is no useful functor from $\mathcal{S}$ to the associated derived category $D(M_{FG})$. Computationally, the morphism groups in $\mathcal{S}$ are the target of an Adams-Novikov spectral sequence whose $E^2$ page can be described as morphism groups in $D(M_{FG})$.
