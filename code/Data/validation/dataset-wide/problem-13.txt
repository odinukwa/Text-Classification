Artifacts are not just things to be owned by anyone. Artifacts are filled with magic and certain artifacts, the ones that are really powerful, have their own will and they have conditions for ownership. Some might just prefer their owner to be murdered before they allow themselves to be taken, some might not want their owner's murderer to own them and some might just even disappear along with their owner. The merchant has to be willing to part with the artifact. This particular artifact won't interact with anyone who means harm to their owner and will only change ownership if its owner wants to give it up. This might be interpreted as "I could just coerce him to give it up." but that won't work, because the artifact will know that you meant its owner harm and it won't cooperate with you and will even go so far as to destroy itself if you ever try to use it. It might even want revenge and call the second strongest mage in the world, in a manner similar to The One Ring in Lord of the Rings, and that might just mean it becomes the tipping point between you and the second strongest. You wouldn't want those possibilities to become reality, even if they're really improbable, so you decide not to harm him in any way but to either convince him or pay him some way. 

Bad idea. Among all close combat weapons, swords require the most agility. Despite videogames conditioning us that swords require strength and bows require agility, actually it's reversed. Despite movies and videogames showing us fighters who hack at each other sloooowly and with full swings just as if they were chopping wood with an axe, swords were never used for chopping. They were used either for thrusting or cutting, both requiring great wrist agility. See it for yourself in this video. Think about how you could perform those quick motions with a sword rigidly fixed to your arm, without your hands. Against armor, you would be in even deeper trouble. Using sword against armor is possible, but it requires special tactics which would be impossible without being flexible with your hands. Even just basic stabbing would be inefficient, you would not be able to pull your sword back far enough, so an opponent stepping in close would make you completely defenseless. Besides these disadvantages, medieval warriors needed to be proficient in many types of weapons, as all weapon types have advantages and disadvantages. Swords, maces, pikes; open field, ambush, siege or indoors, countering infantry or cavalry, different situations require different weapons and tactics. 

If you can let go of the "instantaneous" experience of the contents of the machine as it travels through time, then instead of programming spatial coordinates to "jump" to, a traveller could simply pilot the machine and adjust its position as they observe the world change around them. This assures your machine won't end up e.g. phasing into a rock formation that's been long eroded (and therefore couldn't be accounted for in data available in the present), as well as assuring it's still on the planet and ends up precisely where it's intended too. Furthermore, with this approach time travel isn't limited by something as dry as the traveller's abstract mathematical skills (or reliance on a supercomputer) and confidence in data, but instead by the traveler's ability to observe, react, and navigate as the world changes around them. 

If you expect to sit down, read a spellbook like a textbook, and learn something about magic, you've got a long way to go. The first lesson any student of magic learns is that you can't learn how magic works or how to control it in the way you'd learn to understand and control mundane things. If you look in a spellbook, all you'll see is incoherent gibberish, scribbles you can't seem to quite focus your eyes on, like optical illusions without the trickery. Just like some illusions make more sense when you learn to relax your eyes to focus at a point beyond them, to receive the knowledge contained in a spellbook you must relax your mind and allow the imagery to become your thoughts. The goal isn't to make sense of the lines, because they already make sense - they are a pure expression of the very essence of the spell they describe. Instead of conforming their wisdom to your mind, you must form your mind to their shapes and motions. You must memorize every subtle detail of their intricacies and visualize each page as part of a larger, super-dimensional sculpture beyond space and time. In so doing, and with singular focus, your thoughts create the ebb and flow of energy throughout your nervous system in such a way as to channel the effects of the spell into being. There is no way to verbally instruct this process - the signal patterns your brain must form are beyond description or control. There is simply too much information. Should a madman actually attempt to write a treatise on a single spell and live long enough to succeed in expounding only the necessary details of its nature, he would fill a library. So really, it's amazing that a single book is enough at all. 

Canyons Virtually any canyon out there is accessible from only a few points (within the area you specified, obviously more in total). You could easily stop them by surrounding canyons. It doesn't have to be small either, the Grand Canyon is an example of that. Mountain Ranges Although they're usually bigger than your proposed area, this might not be the best solution, but it would certainly look nice and not suffocating like a canyon could. Japan has many mountains that you could look at, for inspiration. Let's put a picture in there (open in new tab to see it bigger): 

Humanity has discovered the cure. The cure to what, you say? Why, the cure to everything known of course. Death is no longer part of a human life and there is no "life cycle" anymore. The keepers see that humans have advance far too much and they know that they will be an uncontrollable pest upon the universe or worse, wipe themselves and all life on Earth. So they decide to take action. They make a genetically engineered virus (if they can) or do it in a fantastical / magical way and release it into the air. All of humanity becomes sick in a matter of days and they die off. This way, you can also keep people alive that matter to the story by giving them immunity to the virus. You could also say that, since humans are no longer dying, the gatekeepers went mad with nothing to be done around them. Maybe the gatekeepers were dependent on "the last breath of a human" to keep living, so they had to do something to restart humanity but not necessarily wipe them off. Alternatively, any modification you make on these reasons or methods, or a combination of them, is also applicable. 

An artificial "designer" planet (like Earth in Hitchhiker's Guide) could have been built by an advanced alien race, designed to support life but never populated for whatever reason. This could have been done as much as a billion years before your story begins, and life could still not have evolved naturally. After all, it took nearly a billion years for the first forms of life to appear on our planet, and even then it was primitive and microscopic for another 3 billion years. It might never evolve at all, especially if the planet was designed to lack all the conditions favorable for the spontaneous formation of primitive life. 

In this scene, the formation of 9 identical ships, all relatively small (smaller than the Voyager which is crewed by 150), are generating enough combined power to destroy an entire planet. Larger ships are simply unnecessary. They'll also tend to be slower, easier to hit, and once a critical portion of a large ship is destroyed it's just gone. If one small ship in a megaweapon formation is destroyed, another small ship can take its place. It doesn't even need to be this advanced, either. Firing dozens of smaller missiles or other primitive projectiles can cause as much damage as firing one big one. On the other hand, a larger ship has more room e.g. for a railgun to accelerate a projectile to much higher speeds than smaller ships could. Here's another example from Voyager you might find interesting: 

Dangerous Wildlife You could put a few signs out there and tell the player that there's dangerous wildlife out there, so they should stay back. If they wander off too far, just sic a bear on them and take them down. This also presents the potential of hidden paths that could be explored without being eaten by the wildlife, if the player is brave enough. Although in real-life, the person could fight back, usually get beaten by the bear but fight back nonetheless. There could be roads protected by soldiers, therefore, only a few access points. In general, huge obstacles are a good way to close the player inside a pre-defined space without making them feel restricted. 

They write on horizontal cuts of tree trunks, so they just follow the tree trunk's circles as opposed to trying to make it into a new material. Some might even write in a spiral so as to make it look more artistic. 

Material strength comes from its molecular and/or microscopic structure. Metals are malleable crystals with a strong yet flexible structure that can withstand significant impact forces partially due to the structure's ability to diffuse the impact's energy mechanically, so they're well-suited for armor applications. Of course the density of this structure and the weight of the atoms themselves make the material quite heavy. If you can replace heavier atoms/molecules with lighter ones, it will make the material lighter, but those atoms/molecules most likely won't fit into the metal's crystal lattice as nicely as the ones being replaced, or if they do they probably don't offer the same flexibility - making the structure more rigid and the material harder and/or more brittle. The structure has been compromised, so the effectiveness of the armor is reduced. If you can make that exchange without losing the benefits of that crystalline structure, or if you can reorganize the material into an entirely new structure with similar properties, then you'll manage a lighter material without losing strength. One example of this, fresh in my mind as I just answered another unrelated question with the same example, is aerogel. Aerogel starts as a semi-liquid gel. By "drying" it (i.e. chemically removing the liquid from it so only the solid components remain) through a meticulous process, the resulting material is usually far stronger than the original and only retains a tiny fraction of the original mass. This strength is due entirely to the structure that the solids form as the liquids are removed. In fact, it doesn't benefit or suffer much at all from whatever gas or vacuum may fill the voids within these structures. Aerogels can be made from a variety of materials, including some metals (or rather their oxides). There are also some similar materials, e.g. made of vapor-deposited carbon nanotubes, which are sometimes incorrectly called aerogels but still provide the kind low-mass/high-strength ratio you're looking for. Handwavium could enable this or analagous processes (probably also hand-waved to some extent) to produce similar materials suitable for armor plating. Note that aerogels form extremely effective thermal insulation, so covering a tank in it for example would require special considerations for keeping its internals and personnel cool enough to function. 

It's the year 2068, humanity has managed to get a space elevator working about twenty years ago. Now, they need more metals and rare materials which are found in asteroids. Ships with specialized equipment bring asteroids towards Earth and set them in a very specific orbit, which passes close by the space elevator but does not collide with any other asteroids. Miners work on these asteroids and they get to work and deliver materials using the space elevator. A gigantic construction is underway to complete a self sustaining refinery so that asteroids can be mined and processed in place instead of having them brought to Earth. 

The shelters will not be as strong as the village enclosures of course, but the same goes for a suit. Though, these could even be holes in the ground, not really needing actual dome like structures as in the case of villages or expensive materials as in the case of a suit. 

There is a real world example which might be even more fitting than Chinese (Pinyin vs. Hanzi where native speakers usually know both): The Hungarian runic alphabet. It is completely different from the Latin alphabet, is written right-to-left, and is not completely mapped to the Latin alphabet (it's more compact, many symbols require 2 or 3 characters in the Latin form of the written language). It fell out of use around the 10th century, but was still used in remote locations until around the 15-16th century. This means that there was half a millenium where parts of the population spoke the same language but used a different script. Most native speakers today cannot read it at all, but there are enthusiasts who learn it, and there are still works of literature published using the runic alphabet. In contrast with other runic scripts, whose languages are dead, the Hungarian runic alphabet can still be used perfectly with the contemporary Hungarian language and grammar. Also, the the Hungarian Scout movement teaches this script, so many boy/girl scouts are fluent in it, although the general population isn't. 

If the work is done by remote control, having human operators on-site would probably be preferable to long-distance control due to latency issues. A signal from Earth to Mars can take 20 minutes or more; asteroids in the asteroid belt are at least 6 times as far from Mars (300M km+) as Mars is from Earth (~50M km). If there's zero automation filling in the gaps then just a few seconds of latency could be disastrous. Even if the work is entirely automated, it still probably needs to be monitored and managed by at least one human. Without a human present, problems will take at least as long as latency permits to hear about, and at least as long again to correct. If the automated system doesn't recognize a failure at all, then it might go unnoticed until the next shipment arrives, which will take orders of magnitude longer than a signal. If the system isn't equipped to correct a problem then you also have the time it takes to deploy a repair or recovery mission anyway. Time is money. The cost of keeping skilled and well-equipped humans on-site is surely negligible in comparison to the expense of fixing problems and optimizing operation from a great distance. 

If the "robot overlord" is really a superintelligent and self-sufficient AI (instead of an army of drones still listening to a human chain of command, or even an AI chain of command like in the movie "I, Robot"), then the most practical solution would be an artificial intelligence which understands human psychology much better than the humans themselves, so it can out-gambit any human. You will need no robot army enforcing rules with weapons. Give this AI a means to have personal contact with every human, for example, making it part of their operating system, or cell phone, as a companion giving the humans advices, or chatting with them when they feel bored, etc. As the AI understands humans better then the humans understand themselves, it can, given enough time, persuade people to do whatever it wants. Note, that this would be no propaganda on the television screens or out of megaphones on the streets, and no commands will be given by robots with weapons, like you can find in many dystopian movies. The "propaganda" would be suited to each individual, by knowing their most important values and deepest desires. A good example for this would be the hard sci-fi stories of the Optimalverse, stories centered around the story Friendship is Optimal. In it, an AI has the following hard-coded goal: satisfy the values of humans, with one limit: any change performed on a human must require said human's consent, which is not allowed to be accomplished via force or threat of force. It still finds a way to subjugate all of mankind
