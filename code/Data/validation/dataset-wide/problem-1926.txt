and then he can practice hitting his own deadlines. This also gives him opportunities to practice estimation and communication: the really important thing about missing deadlines is that you identify you're going to miss it as early as possible and communicate that upwards, so that between you you can work out steps to either correct what's going on and hit the deadline or mitigate the impact of missing it. So worst case he gets to learn all of this in a pressure-free environment, and best case he gets a reputation for being reliable and easy to manage (which bosses like). The issue is if this isn't enough of an external stick to overcome his self-discipline problems, but it seems safer to try and tackle that himself without deliberately risking his own job in the process. And there are better ways to solve self-motivation problems! 

so you should check he's gone to see someone, and that he's doing something about it for his own good if not your own. I don't think he'd take it too badly if you approached him in person. "That's a nasty cough you've got, have you seen someone about it? Well you should, you've had it for a few weeks now." etc. After all that's concern for him not yourself. But if you want some anonymity and weight behind it then I think the best thing to do is to approach him through his manager. 

No, it's not - but you do need to be capable of working independently when you have to. Asking good questions will make the whole team more efficient: picking up a large codebase from scratch is difficult, and if someone can give you any pointers at all it makes a huge difference. But there are times when there will be no-one around who can help you, or you're already the expert, so it's not always an option. That said there is a balance to be struck between asking questions and distracting the people you're asking. It's more-or-less like asking a question on StackOverflow: before you go to them do a bit of research yourself to make sure you give the impression you've at least tried to solve the problem yourself, and ask something specific as possible. (Unlike StackOverflow though it's also OK to ask early for a general direction to get started, and brainstorm ideas.) And try to limit the amount you ask: if you're genuinely stuck and unable to make any progress then do ask, but be wary of annoying people by asking too many questions and failing (from their point of view) to take on board what they've already told you. It sounds like your boss is being unreasonable here, but you're unlikely to change his attitude: sometimes you just have to get by without any help. (Or maybe he thinks he's helped you enough already, or maybe he's trying to help you to be more independent.) WordPress is unusual in that there's lots of documentation and examples (of varying quality) for simple stuff, but beyond a point your best option is to read and understand the relevant PHP code. (Again, just finding the relevant code is often difficult in an unfamiliar codebase.) If you just need to develop a bootstrap-based theme then your best bet would be to read up on the page selection code to understand the interface between the core code and the theme, and to look at a few simple example bootstrap-based themes to see how they work, and steal ideas and code from them liberally (it's all GPL after all). 

Some resumes run this list together as a single paragraph. However, I prefer this list style to the paragraph of text, as it's much easier to scan. Your resume is your flier, and should be easy to digest by the reader. As a student, you may not have much work experience, but you can list the projects you've completed (both assignments and extra curricular - extra points if you have enough extra curricular projects for a new section). When you do this, definitely list the technologies you used - the information about what you've achieved with a language is a great indicator of proficiency. Finally, remember that it's not an issue to say "I don't know" in an interview - unless your resume made it look like you said you did (so never lie on your resume). 

The answer almost certainly depends on what country you're in. It doesn't say on your profile, so here's an answer from where I am (Australia - though I would assume it's similar for most English speaking countries). Shaking everyone's hands at the beginning of the day isn't normal anywhere I've worked - In Australia shaking hands is usually for the first time you meet, or perhaps if you haven't met in a while. I would say it's likely that the managers are just doing this to introduce themselves the new guy. Although you say "regularly" I would guess that: 

The information that you've dabbled in other languages (possibly outside your course) is useful to an employer. However, as others have said, you don't want to represent familiarity with a language or technology you've only dabbled with. There's no reason you can't just list your proficiency alongside each language or library. You could do this in a quantitative way (number of projects completed, number of years of experience), or you could qualify it with some sort of label. I've seen this done using an analogue to spoken languages like this: 

Usually, I'd just say "Good morning" or "Hello" to the people I see on the way in and my team when I arrive at my desk. But don't worry about it too much. There isn't an expected morning tradition - just smile and say hello when you arrive. 

It sounds like there's a toxic work environment in that team that needs to be fixed. Again that's your TL and PM's responsibility. In particular next time someone gets blamed unfairly get your TL to follow it up to work out what actually did happen, under the usual guise of making sure it doesn't happen again. 

Obviously it's his responsibility to pay you on time, and if he needs to do any admin first (true or not) then it's his responsibility to get that done in time so that he can pay you. In the short term - he's said he'll pay you for this month and hasn't - your only choice is to chase him regularly. Go to him in person and ask if he can pay you now. If not, get a firm commitment from him when he will, and be specific - don't take 'the end of the week', make it 'Friday lunchtime'. If that's more than a few days away then go back to him a day or two before the deadline and remind him, and check he's still prepared to pay you on time. The important thing is not to take any vagueness or any excuses. Ask if it'd help to talk to his boss if you can. If you do walk away from a conversation without getting all the answers you need then don't be afraid to turn around and talk to him again. It's perfectly reasonable to nag and chase him over this - he's letting you down. If he does miss an agreed deadline then you're well within your rights to act annoyed and disappointed, and (without raising your voice) demand an explanation, and a new firm commitment that he'll definitely hit. Ditto try and escalate this to his boss too, and don't take any excuses. For future months you can chase him in advance: shortly before the end of the month send him a timesheet with your days worked, illnesses and absences. Follow that up in person and check that if there's anything else he'd need to pay you on time, and get him to agree that he will pay you on time. Nobody likes to be nagged, and it can be uncomfortable doing the nagging, but until you reliably get paid on time you're going to have to. I'm never a fan of saying 'leave your job' but you do definitely need to get to the bottom of why this is happening as it really doesn't sound good. Again you're well within your rights to have that conversation with your boss (and his boss) and not take any excuses.
