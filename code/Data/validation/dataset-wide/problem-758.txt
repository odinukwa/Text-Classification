The mass of the galaxy (mostly in the form of dark matter) is in a roughly spherical blob. So if you look at mass, the galaxy isn't a disc, it is a spheroid. But Dark Matter is invisible, and what we can see (stars, gas etc) is in a disk. The reason that Dark matter and the normal matter behave differently is that when gas flows there is "friction" (Dark matter doesn't interact with itself or normal matter). This causes the gas to heat up, and that heat energy is then released (as infra-red, light and so on) This means that over time the gas in the galaxy will tend to fall to a lower level. However the gas also has angular momentum (it is rotating), and angular momentum must be conserved (it can't be radiated away like energy). So the gas will try to fall into a low energy configuration that can maintain angular momentum. The shape that achieves this is a disc. Any gas clouds that are not orbiting in the plane of the disc will hit it, and over time they will be pulled into the same disc. Gas clouds produce stars, and so most stars will also be in the plane of the disc. Very old clusters of stars in globular clusters however can be found in a spherical pattern around the disc. So galaxies form disc shapes because the gas that makes stars falls into a disc shape. However, not all galaxies are discs. When disc-shaped galaxies collide, this can disturb the orbits of the stars, and you get a galaxy which is "blob" shaped, these are called elliptical galaxies, and are very common. Small galaxies also often don't have a disc structure either. These are called irregular galaxies. 

The seven who convicted were Felice Centini, Desiderio Scaglia, Antonio Barberini, Berlinghiero Gessi, Fabrizio Verospi, Guido Bentivoglio and Marzio Ginetti. And as you note Francesco Barberini, Laudivio Zacchia and Gaspare Borgia did not. These three didn't vote to acquit, they were just absent from the signing of the condemnation - we don't know why All information from The Galileo Case: Trial, Science, Truth page 142 By Mario D'Addio.

All these planets are naked eye objects, and except for Mercury, are easy to see. Venus is also part of this grouping, Meaning that all 5 planets known to ancient astronomers are on the same side of the Earth. (and the sun is on the other) The planets are not exactly "aligned", just they are all visible in the sky, spread over a wide part of the south eastern sky, a little while before dawn. Sky and Telescope has some nice guides to what you can expect. Mercury is always the hardest, as it is always in the twilight. Saturn is an easy sight, appearing as a slightly yellow star. Binoculars will show its moon, Titan. Best time is around the first week of Feb about 45 min before dawn. 

Yes, yes and yes. Your main misconception is that satellites follow a sinusoidal path. That is just a distortion of the map. The path of the satellite is in a single plane. When that plane meets the Earth produces a great circle (which is effectively straight, there are no straight lines on the curved surface of the Earth, great circles are the closest that you get to straight) When you project that great circle onto a map you may get a sinusoidal path, it depends on the projection. Your statement "The ground track of a satellite follows a sinusoidal path" is not correct, that is just an effect of the transformation from a globe to a plane, not "real". The path of the fragments is, compared to the size of the Earth is very short, it is on the same great circle that the satellite was orbiting in (except as the fragments get closer to the ground they start to move with the atmosphere). If projected they would be on the same track as the satellite. But a great circle is the closest thing to straight on the surface of the Earth. The rotation of the Earth is much slower than the orbital speed. By the time the fragments have slowed to terminal velocity then they fall roughly in a parabolic curve to Earth, the same as if you threw a ball off a building. 

The light from distant galaxies is redshifted because they are moving away from us and the more distant the galaxy is the faster it moves, and so the more the light is redshifted. A galaxy between us and a very distant galaxy is also moving away from us, but less fast. From the point of view of that galaxy the light of the distant galaxy is redshifted less than from our position, because the distant galaxy is not moving away from it as fast. The light would appear less red in "a galaxy which lies between". 

If the inertial mass is not equal to the gravitational mass, it would be equivalent to the gravitational constant, G, being different, or perhaps non-constant, for dark matter. If that were so, the manner in which dark matter would orbit the milky way would be different, leading to a different distribution of dark matter We know from the rotation curve of the milky way roughly how dark matter is distributed in the milky way. Our models are consistent with the inertial mass of dark matter being equal to the gravitational mass. This is, of course, far from "proof". As we don't even know what dark matter is, it is impossible to be certain of any of its properties. And the equivalence of inertial and graviational mass is not "proved" even for normal matter (but no experiment has ever detected a difference) But it would be exceedingly surprising if gravity affected dark matter differently, and there would need to be strong evidence for that. As it stands, there is none. 

The moon has a monthly motion called libration Of interest to you is libration in latitude. The orbit isn't exactly in the plane of the ecliptic, and the rotation axis is slightly different from each. This means that about a week after passing its ascending node, you can see up to about 6.5 degrees past the moon's South pole. Two weeks later, the south pole is invisible, but then north pole can be seen. From the point of view of an observer on Shackelton it would mean that over the course of a month the Earth would slowly rise and then set again. 

Most galaxies have enough dust to hide their cores from investigation in visible light. But the jet from an AGN is composed of large amounts of relativistic particles, and is easily powerful enough to clear any dust out of its path. We see in M87 a jet punch 5000 light years from an active nucleus. The dust that hides Sagittarius A* is not localised around the black hole, it is spread through the bulge, bar and disk. You would not want to be anywhere near an active galactic nucleus. Large amounts of radiation are produced by the accretion disc surrounding the black hole. Distance and dust may provide some protection to a star orbiting an active galaxy at the distance of the sun from Sag A*, but not if the star is directly in the jet. 

That is called a corona. It is caused by diffraction of light by thin clouds with small but evenly sized particles. The best coronas show multiple coloured bands. There is a similar, but unrelated, phenomenon, called a halo, which is caused by high altitude ice crystals with a regular hexagonal shape. It is much larger, 22 degrees wide. Both these can be seen around the sun as well as the moon, and are fairly common, more common than rainbows (for example).
