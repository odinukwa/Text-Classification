Besides this fact that we don't have 3 genders like in German, in dutch we only have 2 genders, and since 1940 there are no more noun cases such as "accusative", "dative", "genitive" in standard dutch practically anymore. 

About Numerals, yes! Since those numerals belongs to Persian language, they are the same and even the same with Arabic except that number 4 number in Arabic which is different. Each one of these three language are in addition to be a separate language -especially about Arabic which is completely from a different language family- In written part there are several completely different characters which don't exist in the other one. (and of course Persian is not written with Arabic script, instead, Arabic is written with Persian script, There are some documentation that illustrate why (it's another topic...) look at this examples: 

Well, There are much more similarities either etymologically or grammatically in order to translate Dutch vocabulary into German (rather than into English): 

Here in Parsi.wiki website you can see transcribtion for specifically Old Persian, and for Middle Persian, just choose one of "Dekhoda=دهخدا or Moien= معین" dictionaries. 

Answer to the first question: The Dutch "s" is the same phoneme as English "s" just as Alveolar type of pronunciation and also like Spanish "s" but not that much similar in south-american-Spanish "s"; and dutch "s" is a little bit voiceless which is not tangible often. I guess the sequence and combination of 'S' with another letter makes you a little confused. Just like German, if you have "s" followed by some consonants it will change to [ʃ] phoneme. 

I had a thought a few days ago while I was thinking about conlangs. If a language had a strict verb-final order, it could easily get away without using punctuation to show the end of a sentence. German somewhat does this. Its sub-clauses are always SOV (simple sentences are normally V2 order). This means that the end of a sub-clause is marked by the verb, which makes center embedding rather easy. Of course, there are languages that really were written without punctuation in the past. East Asia didn't have punctuation until recently. And Latin, at least early on, didn't even put spaces between words. Of course, the far east has an advantage in that they use logographs heavily (though Korean has largely abandoned their use). Thus they don't need to use spaces to show word boundaries (and yes, I know Japanese has a syllabrary, but word boundaries are still pretty obvious most of the time since logographs have to always appear at the beginning of a word, thus a syllable followed by a logograph always indicates a word boundary). Also, both Japanese and Korean are SOV. Chinese, however, is SVO and configurational. I don't get how they could get away without marking sentence boundaries. And note, this was all in the ancient past. There's probably a good reason why languages today all have punctuation. They at the very least will indicate the boundary between sentences, if nothing else. 

I have found a paper that addresses this question directly (finally!). Svenonius & Ramchand's 2014 paper (here) offers an explanation for universal "grammatical zones" that appeals both to innate grammatical principles and properties of extralinguistic cognition. From the abstract: 

Mary is taller than John |= John is shorter than Mary Mary is shorter than John |= John is taller than Mary Mary is longer than John !|= John is shorter than Mary (where !|= reads as "does not entail") 

I think your question may reflect an instance of a much more general pattern. That is, suppose you find an expression X in a language, and another expression Y in that language, and you believe X and Y to stand in a "privileged" relation (two types elaborated below). It seems that, across languages, one is likely to find that X and Y occur as simplex (i.e., nondecomposable) lexical items asymmetrically: i.e., if Y occurs as a simplex lexical item in the language, so does X. But simplex X occurring in a language does not guarantee expression of simplex Y. One concrete example to explain one notion of a "privileged" relation between two expressions is privileged antonymy. Consider the adjectives tall and short: we "feel" that these expressions are related in a way that makes the inferences in (1) and (2) valid, but not that in (3) (despite long on occasion meaning something very similar to tall): 

This is something I've been thinking about. It would be rather hard to tell a story without using a pluperfect. I know there are languages that lack tense, like Chinese, but what about languages that do have tense systems? Japanese for instance has pretty much just past and non-past. What kind of structure would they use where we would use a pluperfect? I should note that the only languages I'm deeply familiar with are English (my native language) and German (which does have a pluperfect, formed the same way we form one in English). I did study Japanese for a few years when I was younger and into anime, but I never really got far into it. I only know the basics of the grammar. 

Chinese lacks gendered pronouns, and always has. The language is as un-sexist as you can get; there aren't even words for man and woman. The only 'gendered' words that exist are literally just the words for 'male' and 'female'. To translate 'man' or 'woman', you would have to say 'male person' and 'female person'. But I believe its common to make that distinction anyway. And besides, ancient China was hardly egalitarian. When it comes to gender equality, surprisingly enough, medieval Europe was one of the better cultures out there. 

Linguistics is the scientific study of language. A language is narrowly defined as the set of rules that "speakers" (speaking or signing) acquire when they are very, very young. There is evidence for processes of language acquisition underway at the very youngest testable ages (under a year old). A speaker with a grammar like mine knows, without ever being told, that strings of words like colorless green ideas sleep furiously are well-formed, but strings like furiously sleep ideas green colorless are not. I can say that the first sentence would be true if (i) there existed some things that were colorless, green, and ideas, (ii) such things could sleep, and (iii) such sleepings could happen furiously. The other string supports no such interpretation. Since I don't have to look up these two strings in some kind of book to tell whether one is good or bad, we say that my grammatical rules are internalized. The rules of grammar (again, in the linguist's sense) are learned implicitly. They are not taught, as the rule "i before e except after c" has to be learned when one learns how to spell, but rather inferred on the basis of experience in a linguistic environment (i.e., a community of speakers who do some speaking in the presence of the child). Lastly, knowledge of language is universal. Barring severe cognitive deficits or social deprivation, every normally-developing child acquires a native tongue. Written language stands in sharp contrast: children learn to read and write much later (usually once they start attending school) than they learn to understand and produce spoken language; written language has no internalized rules, it reflects only the speakers' internal rules and, possibly, a speaker's regard for the prescriptive rules of style; written language has to be learned explicitly (often laboriously); and, written language is not universal—there are many, many people on this planet who have knowledge of language but can't read or write. "Written language" is an artifact of (some) human cultures who already had spoken languages. Spoken language is definitional of our species, and it is this kind of species-specific capacity that linguists study. This is not to say that the capacity for writing is not complex; it is in fact more complex than the capacity for language, in that explaining how we can have writing systems requires in part an explanation of what the language we're writing down is in the first place. 

Languages tend to drop their inflections over time. Eventually, people just get tired of all the irregularities and complex conjugations/inflections and so they gradually drop out of use. Of course, not all languages do this. The Slavic languages for example were just as inflectional as Latin 2,000 years ago. But whereas the romance languages (Latin's descendents) have for the most part become more isolating, the Slavic languages have only become even more inflecting. The number of irregular verbs in those languages is just rediculous. As for why European languages are all so similar? Contact. They're all part of a 'sprachbund' called 'standard average european' (or SAE for short). Well, not all of them. The celtic languages aren't a part of the sprachbund, even though Hungarian is (its not even related to either the Germanic or Romance languages). But the point is in a Sprachbund, languages tend to borrow grammatical features from eachother. Its why they all have undergone similar changes. Its not that languages become simpler over time, its just an illusion caused by the odd history and development of the European languages. Besides, if languages did tend towards a 'simple' configurational grammar like English, then by now all languages on Earth would be like Chinese. Yes, even 'simple' languages like English can develop complexities. If you want to know how case endings develop, it starts with a language that is postpositional (meaning it relies on postpositions far more than prepositions). Over time, the space between the noun and the postposition vanish, turning it into a suffix. And sound change then further distorts the suffix. And because nouns don't all end in the same sound, each suffix will evolve differently depending on which phoneme the noun originally ended in, thus creating multiple declinations. It should be noted that the 'grammatical gender' thing was something the Romans came up with to try and deduce a logical pattern to which declination a noun belonged to, because they had no way of knowing how it came to be in the first place. Though it should be noted that case endings can develop in other ways too. Some languages have just outright borrowed case endings from another language, causing them to develop case endings seemingly out of nowhere. You could say that some languages are simpler than others in some ways (some languages do have more irregularities than others). But overral, the difference isn't that much, and languages don't tend towards becoming 'simpler' perpetually. They can just as easily become even more irregular.
