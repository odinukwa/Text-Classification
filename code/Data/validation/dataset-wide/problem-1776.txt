I do not need 64GB of swap/temp space. Is it possible to reduce that storage and add it to LVM? /dev/sda5 to be precise 

I have two nodes besides the puppet master listed in my puppet master. The two are currently listed as unresponsive. It appears the puppet agents are failing to run automatically. In my logs on the agents it lists: Pastie link as its a bit long: $URL$ However if I run puppet agent -t manually: 

I am currently trying to find the oid / way to gather the CPU model name from a server using SNMP. I have tried looking up the specific oid for it however all I could find were ones that related to CPU usage and not what I needed. Unless I missed it, I could not find it on $URL$ either. Would appreciate any help that the community could offer to gather this information via SNMP 

I am trying to increase the PE size of one of my Volume groups. I mistakenly set it as 4M to start when it should have been 32M . When I try to change the size I get 

I recently bought a used Sun Blade 2500 Silver. The system has been completly wiped, so I get an OpenBoot prompt when I boot. When I look on Oracle's compatibility page, I can see the station is able to run Solaris 10 8/11. So I downloaded the OS from the Oracle website. According to the documentation I found, to install Solaris 10 from OpenBoot should be quite easy: put the DVD in the player, enter and then follow the instruction on screen. Problem is, when I enter , I get the following message: 

I'm about to buy a used Sun Sparc machine (Sun Blade 2500 Ultrasparc IIIi 1,28Ghz) in order to use it as a personal development server. Problem is, it is sold without any OS. I would like to install a Solaris system on it, but I don't know what I'm looking for. I think Solaris 10 should work, since it was released the same year than the machine, but I'm not sure. And could the newer Solaris 11 work on it? 

I am trying to add the current time to my bash in Redhat. I'd like it to read: [user@hostname 01:01:01 ~] and obviously be relative to when the bash prompt was placed there. Any ideas if this is possible, and if so, how? 

I am trying to establish an SFTP connection on an AS400, which is on an OS that is not running a Linux based kernel. Any idea where I can start with this? 

but I'd like to avoid that, if I can use some functionality of the program. I get that this is more of an "RTFM" question, but I've gone through the manual, and I'm still not seeing how to do it. 

I am using md5deep to try take a list of md5 hashes from a list of files (approximately 100,000 hashes) and I'm comparing them to the NSRL hash list (15gb text file). I'm trying to accomplish 1 thing: Output hashes from my 100,000 that do not match hasehs in the NSRL hash list. I am having trouble figuring out how to pass the 100,000 hashes in correctly. Here is what I have: 

I still don't understand completly how the different partitions are mounted, so I suppose there is something I don't understand in the currenct situation... 

I'm getting this message even if I reboot the server, and I can't see a process that could cause this. The server is working under a Debian with a 2.6.18-4-amd64 kernel. Could you help? Edit: More details about what my colleague tried out. After unmounting sda1, the command worked. But now, we still have an error message after : 

I'm trying to stop a RAID disk in order to replace it by a new one, as this one is not working properly. I'm typing , and I'm getting an error message: 

We just got a major disaster: somebody made an uncontrolled update on the production database, and obviously, the backup process is not working since a long time, so we got a major data loss. A 40 millions rows table is now full of garbage. Does anybody has an idea to restore the data? For example, a tool using filesystem recovery? Facts: 

I am trying to use SNMPSet to execute a command on a remote server. I'm not 100% sure this is possible. I've been researching this, but I cant find any way to do this. Any insight would be appreciated. 

When I installed OpenVAS, I was prompted for a password, however the prompt errored out. I have installed OpenVAS and it is working properly, however I cant get in as admin (I created a new user and that works fine). I've tried googling how to reset admin password, recover admin password, change the access of a user to admin, but to no avail. Greenbone Security Assistant is version 4.0. OpenVAS is version 6 I believe (I just installed it today) Host OS is Kali Linux. 

I have setup fail2ban to monitor a service which I have exposed outside my router. The files are being logged properly, and the events are being picked up by fail2ban
