My guess is the alignment was like that before the accident and the reason the gears wont adjust is the derailleur hanger is bent, which is a $10 part and/or a visit to the LBS with a tool to fix it. Even if the frame has been bent, although less than ideal, it is not a safety issue and would not stop me using it - as long as the derailleur hanger can be aligned correctly. However there may be other more critical, but less obvious damage (cracks etc), that you are not aware of, and this be the reason for the insurance write off. As for going to carbon frame, for the same money you are almost certainly better off with a steel or alloy frame. Cheap carbon, like everything, is cheap for a good reason. As Carbon is seen as a material with God like qualities by many novices, it commands a price premium based on that perception at the budget end, its until you are paying mid range prices that carbon really shines. 

Been there and not done that. The only option I found was to go used, but even then, its hard to get a reasonably prices upgrade. A better option for me was replace the bike. For the price of upgrading the shock (at least $400) I sold my old bike ($300) and got an 'as new' bike that was much better all round. Accept that you are choosing to ride her cheap bike. Even if you upgrade the shocks, you will be still be riding a cheap bike..... before you know it it will be Grandfathers Axe (3 new heads and 4 new handles, but its the same axe my grandad used). 

It is not ANT+ - only the HR-11 is listed on "thisisant.com" (and its too old to be ANT+) I suspect it will analogue - most likely would be Polar compatible but cannot be certain. There are Cateye digital monitors, and also ANT+ monitors, the digital ones have "Digital" written on them, which is why I suspect analogue Best option (IMHO) would be to turf it and go ANT+... The other go down to a local gym, or find a someone with Polar compatible gear and see if their gear picks it up (put in a new battery). But what will you do if you can find this out - buy a new watch based on obsolete technology? 

I have a background in developing consumer GPS systems...... There is no doubt that a Garmin is a much better device for the job. On cell phones, GPS and associated functionality is the side dish - as in "would you like fries with your burger", on a Garmin, is the Raison d'Ãªtre. Hardware wise, its a no brainier. First, as already mentioned in @armb answer, is battery life - Cell phones start small with the smallest battery they can get away with, ever seen a Cellphone with battery life specified - with GPS turned on - there is a reason for that. Robustness - cell phone - robust not... There are few slightly rugged ones (I have a Motorola Defy) - but they don't match a Garmin. My defy is supposed to be water proof (IP66, 1/2 hour 1 meter under water). I don't worry about rain, but sure as anything ain't going to put it under water - it has one tiny O ring to seal it, I bet an IP66 Garmin has 2 decent sized ones. Another issue to think about is that phones have tiny GPS antennas (Remember the fries). Cell phones use assisted start - where the cell network provide key information on start up, allowing them to find the satellites easier. Its easy for a GPS to track where you are once it knows where (and when) you are. If it doesn't know where you are, it doesn't know where to "look" for the satellites, and needs to search for them. Think of looking for a buoy on the water. If you get told, "Find the buoy" it can take forever to find it. With training and binoculars, it's easier, but if I say "The buoy is over there, keep watching it" - anyone can see it (that assisted start). With no data connection, no assisted start - think minutes to get a fix every time you turn it on, even in perfect conditions, and never in marginal conditions vs Garmin taking a few seconds and nearly always. Research "GPS TTFF" (Time to First Fix). A Garmin with its better GPS front end, will hold the fix much more reliably, if you ride "urban canyons", forests and such like its important. Software - I mostly use my Defy when on the bike these days - there is a range of Android software probably as good as Garmin has, but you need to find the right one from the hundreds of most rubbish available, install it, jump though hoops with your right pinky finger in you left ear...... Garmin will work out the box. Sim Card - most cells need a sim card to get past the startup screen....... Summary - a Cell phone will probably work - with a bit of shagging around, you might even find it acceptable. Garmin will work out the box.... 

Based on the 19mm wheel radius change given by @Argenti, and presuming 'normal' MTB setup and similar forks, with just a travel change, setting sag at 30% of travel, a 20mm increase in fork travel will lift the front (accounting for about 70degree head angle) 10 mm. Therefore the 19mm rolling radius drop will lower the bars 10mm. The camber is specified with a 2.3" tire - you could go to a 2.4 or 2.5" tire to make up the that difference (wider tires usually have a larger diameter). As far a BB height change - its less than half the change in the front. Overall I expect the changed geometry would affect the bikes handling marginally, and the difference in bars, stem, fork and shock, tire and tire pressure setting will be far more significant. 

Clip-less (and before them, clips) came out of the road riding community where the emphasis is on power transfer and efficiency. The most efficient position is the ball of the foot on the spindle (+/-1 a few mm). if you look at all early, and most modern, road shoes and cleats, its clear they are not suited to mountain biking and are designed for one task - the no compromise transfer of as much power from the rider to the bike as possible. When MTB'ers started to use clipless, the advice remained "ball of foot" position, however by the late 1990's it was shown for MTB riders this is flawed - that the stability and control offered with the foot further forward (In the extreme, spindle under the arch) provides a far better outcome when riding. How far forward/back is always a trade off between efficiency and control/balance. With flats, its not an issue - move your foot forward fro the gnarly downhill, back for an uphill grunt. It took a long time for the ideas of those pioneers to been widely acknowledged. Its only in the last few years (its taken this long) MTB shoes are being manufactured with the slots for cleats further back than previous models - I knew elite riders in the late 1990's who drilled holes and mounted their cleats behind the slots of shoes available at the time. You will still hear a lot of people repeating the dogma that the ball should be over the spindle, they are very wrong, and the more extreme and technical the Mountain biking, the more wrong they are. Another question that needs to be asked by every Mountain Biker who rides clip-less is 'Why, what advantage do they give over flats'? - the reason I mention this is if the roadies use clip less for one thing, improve power transfer, and the cleats back position we use on MTB is a compromise, whats the gain we are getting. 

I am not sure you are after "The quickest Boost food" - seems the problem you have is likely to be over an extended period. If your problem is say "they leave me behind up big hills" then maybe a "boost" is what you are after, but if its just keeping up over the duration of the ride, quick boost food is not good. The problem with the likes of Jelly beans, honey etc is the quick boost is followed by an energy crash - often of disproportionate proportions to the boost you got. These sources have a place - but generally should only be used when the finish line is in site and only when you know how the affect you. Bananas, energy bars and gels are usually better as they have more complex carbs that release the energy over a longer time and reduce the effects of the low sugar crash. These should be used before you feel the need for them, so the energy is there when its needed, and ideally consumed regularly in small amounts - if needed set a repeating timer and eat when it beeps - every 10-20 minutes. As everyone is different, the best advise is to try different foods and choose one you like, and different frequencies and amounts - most people do better on small and often. Do this before you need it - some gels make me want to vomit when working hard, others work really well for me. If you have one that disagrees with you, best its not when you are not trying to keep up with a bunch. 

If the wheel fits..... If you have been using it, then no, you won't have problems. Its not that uncommon for people to shoe horn a 27.5" wheel into a 26 fork or frame. just running a front wheel will slightly change the bikes geometry, but not enough to make a big difference. Where you can run into trouble is if clearances are not enough and you ride in muddy conditions, causing build up and blocking. When you replace the tire, you will need to be careful to get one that fits. Most 27.5" "upgrades" require a smallish (2.1) tire, and you will want to avoid ones with aggressive side lugs unless you can try before you buy. 

Forks break. Every brand has examples of it. Its a given when people push bike past their design limits many times. Your more likely to be hit by a car or stuck by lightening. While Suntour XCR's are a budget shock, they are a mountain bike shock used on entry level bikes sold by dealerships. A bike with XCR's is usually not what I would call a BSO. They are an XC shock, certainly not designed for landing 4 foot drops, but should handle riding down stair cases provided you are not jumping. Suntour is a major player in entry level MTB's, and as such, is a reputable brand. They don't have the brand power of RockShox or Fox etc because they don't play in the "money is no object' space and don't sponsor world cup riders I believe its unlikely the fork will fail catastrophically. You may damage its internals and it might wear out quicker than a more expensive shock. Worst case is likely a major crack or bend, but the fork staying in one piece. That said, if your taking 4 foot jumps, all bets are off. A bad landing can break a frame in half on any bike, let alone an entry level XC bike. (In the early 1990's I was landing 4 footers on fully rigid bikes, so in theory, no need for suspension. But then I was 20 something and my frontal lobe had not yet developed fully) 

Keep a very close eye on costs - upgrading from Tourney means the bike was not really high spec to start with. Its likely a 1x11 gear set will cost more than the bike is worth, and provide no significant advantage over upgrading just the rear derailleur and shifter (Cassette, chain, shifter cables are really consumables). 

As the axle is also higher, you need to really consider the Ground to Crown height rather than the axle to ground height. Also as the 29er is a larger diameter wheel, it may not clear the down tube, and may interfere with the feet when the pedals are horizontal. Combining all this and the fact the geometry will alter the handling somewhat in ways that may or may not be significant depending on the bike and your person riding style it seems to be a fairly big risk. Only you can decide if its worth it. 

I have never had a problem getting single bolt tight enough to hold. Most likely is seat rail diameter - 7mm is common road, 9mm common MTB but there are others. (refer Wikipedia). Is there something assembled wrong, a piece upside down? Although seat post bolts need to be tight, what ever you do, don't be 'that' "gorilla with a spanner" - it is never the correct approach when assembling bicycles. 

One thing not mentioned is that lighter bikes are more expensive, and have higher margins than cheaper bikes. Also the higher priced, bikes tend to have higher margins, why sell you a $200 bike and make $10 profit when he can sell you a $500 bike and make 50, or $2000 and make $1000 profit. Lighter bikes also last a shorter time - getting back to the shop so they get more $$$$, they also tend to need more maintaince - back to the shop, more $$$$$ - that performance does not come cheap. Also remember that cycling is the new golf - as such, people often want to be seen to have a better (or at least as good) bike than his riding partner. It's nothing more than personal choice if you want to play that game, but the sales guy (If he's any good) will make you feel you have to play it. There is a price point where you get a happy medium for you. For me, it's a steel frame hardtail MTB at $900- For others, it's a $200 Walmart special and others a $5000 carbon dream machine. Only thing is, don't let the shop guy convince you need to spend more than you are prepered to, especially if his only reason is "You go faster". Spend money where it counts - for a commuter, reliabilty and comfort. To cheap and things are not only heavy , but not well built and unreliable. A bit more will get you heavy and reliable, soon you are spending money to save weight, and trading reliability and length of life to get it. Personally I feel that for a commuter, steel frame and mid - high end components is better than carbon with low-mid components. 

Daniel R Hicks has the right answer - I had an old bike with RX100 Brifters that stopped working. From what I know, disassembling any Brifter is best left to the experts and desperate. Although I was by far the latter, I had little choice as mine could not be pulled apart. What I ended up doing (after trying lube) is using WD40 and then in desperation, aerosol engine degrease (one of the few times you should let either of this stuff near you bike). It took a day of soaking, with a play every now and then, to get the shifters moving. That was the easy part of the job. After washing out with plenty of water, I had to deal to the problem that although things were moving like they should, there was no lubrication. WD40 might have worked for a day, Oil, chain lube etc a bit longer, but what is needed is grease. Fortunately there are aerosol based Grease products that have a thin carrier that are perfect for the job. I "filled" the brifter with aerosol grease and wiped off the excess. The idea too much grease is better than too little - I can clean grease out if needed, but can't put the metal back on the worn out bits..... The end result was a usable bike at little cost. The other option- new brifters..... In your case, i would look at this approach if you can't find a way to pull them apart (and know for certain you will get them back together.)
