They're more concerned with criminal offenses and (in some cases) bad credit. If you weren't an employee for all the prior projects, your former clients have no obligation to even answer the telephone. Don't worry. 

Pull out of the project, cold-turkey, whether you are finished with any current unit-of-work or not. Announce that at the end of the current unit-of-work, you're done. Announce that at the end of the current unit-of-work, you need to get paid at a rate that is worthy of your time and experience. But you only get to do this ONCE. Don't get greedy. Don't go in demanding part ownership, and don't accept part ownership in lieu of payment. Do nothing and become more miserable over time. 

Here's how this will work. Your manager and maybe the owners have decided that the staff is going to be responsible for cleaning the bathroom. However, they don't want to assign it to be the responsibility of anyone in particular because everyone will balk because that's not the job that you all were hired for. So the strategy is to find one person on the team who they can induce to feel guilty about the bathroom stuff, and that guilty feeling person will pick up the task from that point out. So you are being tested to see if you are that weak link. And your office mates are being tested too, it's just that you're not seeing that part. Do clean up what you might leave in the sink, and if your manager ever speaks to you about cleaning up the entire space without offering you some more money, simply smile and ignore her. Don't commit to anything because you'll become the de facto cleaning-lady. Or in any such conversation ask, "are we also talking about more pay?" She will leave you alone real quick. 

E-mail stating pay. Like most any professional job, the pay range is set by the hiring manager, but the final number is negotiated according to the skill set of the candidate, and it's put into an offer letter for you to acknowledge before starting. However, you can ask the recruiter for a range. Have you asked? If you haven't asked, I can only shake my head. Because you are using a recruiter, you don't call the hiring manager or HR directly for anything. The exception cases would be that you're going to an interview and either can't find the place or are delayed. Other than than, everything is handled by the recruiter. That's the recruiter's job. . Now you're being vague. Is that one mile, ten, twenty, fifty, or 500? If it's within an hour's time driving, it is quite reasonable to expect you to furnish your own transportation at your own cost. If you have a problem with that, you're going to have problems getting any job. Lastly: When it comes down to interviewing, the recruiter's account manager has worked this detail out with the hiring manager and/or HR. An alternate (phone or Skype) interview might be convenient only for you, and you don't want to give the impression that you're difficult to work with. 

He's not an architect. He's a control freak. He may as well tell all the devs to not write any code unless he can pair with them on a personal basis. This approach is completely counterproductive. Escalate this to your boss. 

An attorney could tell you if you have a case. But the other thing to consider is how much it'd cost to get whatever money is outstanding. Hopefully you don't have to take it that far. I'd say a strongly worded letter from an attorney to your employer might do the trick, but please tread lightly with that approach. 

This 'one-day' stuff is not going to pan out. Any seasoned developer worth his/her salt is only going to laugh at such an idea. Additionally, I think it's advisable that you find out how much money it's going to cost you to get a person into a legitimate payroll system, do all the legal paperwork, locate desk space, and pay worker's compensation with the intent of having that all be in place for one day. It is far from trivial and it's going to be a component for anybody running a business. 

As soon as I figure out the conversation's going south, I cut it short by saying that I have to get moving on another (unrelated) task, and then I ask the recruiter to e-mail me the requisition, location, and start date. Often, it's an account manager (with better English skills) who will be handling things after the recruiter, so I ask for the account manager's contact information. The spoken English coming my way is broken, but the recruiter hears just fine! This cuts out more unnecessary frustration on both sides, AND since recruiters seem to often call at awkward moments, I'm spared until I'm interested in reviewing the opportunity. 

Look at it like this. Your actions to date endangered you, and likely traumatized your office mates. So the BIG picture for your employer is not in just examining what you might do, but how it affects everything going on in the office. If you harm yourself on the premises, in front of others, they're going to need outlets to deal with the situation too - which probably has to happen during hours they'd normally be working. I have no right to judge you per se, but some people who attempt suicide are actually more interested in attention than remediation; and your company is making sure that you're not part of the former group -- as ultimately, it will affect productivity. It would be unsound to trash the business behind anyone's selfish act, so they need to flush this situation out. 

Given the circumstances, I'd say, "My priorities don't leave me any time to do any out-of-band technical discussions on this project. But you're free to take a look at the source code which is in _____, or consult my boss if this is a priority. And for technology ____, there's a wealth of information on (google, links, etc)." Take yourself out of it. You're not obligated in any way. You don't have to be concerned with why this person is bugging you about the project. 

You have no legal entitlement unless you work for a government agency where policy is all written down in a rule-book and followed to the letter. But since you work for a Fortune 500, all bets are off.
