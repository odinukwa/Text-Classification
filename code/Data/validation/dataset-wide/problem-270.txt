What really happened here is that the user made a request for the deletion of a specific file. As the user formed its sentence, the computer already started doing all the necessary preparations for its execution, much in the way we humans converse: we can identify a word by its lexeme before the word is completely formed, so we can more or less guess what will come next, but we can't completely understand the full implications of this word until we hear all the morphemes (if any). Likewise, we can try to make a wild guess about which word may come next and try to understand what the other person is trying to tell us, but we will not be sure about the specifics until the whole sentence is complete. Likewise, a single sentence might throw some light into the context of the topic at hand, etc. After the user's request was completed, the object vanished from the user's viewport in a fraction of a second. This point is extremely important because the hackers of the future will attempt to trick the machine into doing something else (or just bring it to a halt) by surprising it with some sort of "punchline" capable of surprising it. Since security programs are concurrent, they can't really understand the full scope of the user's actions until it's already too late. Think of it like setting up a trap for the enemy king in chess over several turns: most of the "illogical" movements made earlier start to make sense the moment your king is killed. The paragraph talking about cranes was actually talking about birds and not boxes, but the computer could have never seen that coming since it mostly operates on sentences and not contexts as big as a paragraph or small text; generally, the precision of its predictions are drastically reduced the bigger the scope is, although it can still operate in bigger schemes if specifically programmed to do so. To identify what the user's trying to say, modern CPU incorporate a neuronal network that allows the OS to retroactively make some sense of words after hearing a string of letters. More often than not this is abstracted from userland programs through the use of libraries and APIs, although they may get access to the wavestream depending on their permissions. The "biometric authentication" system I mentioned before actually operates on big segments of the stream. Since the automatic conversion to "universal brain language" reduces (not removes!) the variance between user brains, trying to identify a user by these differences alone is impossible (not to mention that the, although small but random, noise the line may have, such a level of detail would be impossible). This is why the user authentication software operates on a larger set of thoughts: it detects the approximate state of mind of the user (excited, angry, relaxed, etc) and "mannerisms" they may have. This is more or less the equivalent of the accent a person may have or stylometric analysis of their texts: it identifies them with a high degree of precision, but it's not infallible. Hackers may again try to disguise themselves as the system operator of a device by using meditation techniques to appear as if they were thinking like the legitimate user of said computer. This "universal brain language" I talk about would be more or less like any human language (such as English). It encodes information so everyone can understand it, but it's not digital because the way you speak it may say something more about your message than what the language can express. That means, in the conversation example, the user may be thinking of deleting as symbol A with modifying factor B, while the software translates it to symbol X with modifying factor Y (which may be equal to B, although I haven't thought of that yet. I don't think it actually matters). The modifying factor is what tells the computer that you didn't just think of deleting, but that it also seems to sound as if the user was somewhat distressed or angry: it is analog metadata that would be difficult to translate to digital without butchering its meaning. Here is where the CPU's neuronal networks try to take a guess about what does this metadata mean, much in the same way a human would try to guess what does that tone of voice mean; it may be easier to guess when the modifying factor is stronger. What I originally meant with this question is: how could the CPU process this brainwave? Could some technology directly operate on this wave through the use of analog operation programs or would conversion to digital be required for all cases? Mind you that the CPU has a digital coprocessor that can process those problems where the analog computer can't process that well, although communication between these two may be slightly slower in the same fashion memory to on-die cache transfers are slow. Could the analog CPU be a universal Turing machine, independently of how practical that could be? Alternatively, if this isn't the case, would analog emulation on a digital CPU (emulated neuronal network simulations, like a partial brain simulation) be the only way to tackle this problem? In addition, could information about a wave be persistently stored somewhere? Could said stored wave be actually stored as a wave and not as a "parametrization" of a wave? 

A world in which vampires are known to humankind ... If we are not talking about this world (Remember, there are some diseases which induce people to want to drink blood, but these are ordinary mortal humans.), we might think up some "finer stuff" to flow in the veins of vampires, and the "finer stuff" makes them immortal. Why it makes them weak against sunlight is a question to answer. Maybe in your world it doesn't. And if there is "finer stuff" in their veins, why do they want to drink blood? Okay, maybe the vampires are actually trying to "help" the humans. Anyway, the finer stuff is what pumps their muscles, all of them. But why would such a "vampire" want to have extra-marital sex with humans, if his motivation is to help? Or are these "vampires" properly contracting their marriages? Answering these kinds of questions might help you build an interesting world that isn't just a re-hash of the currently popular vampire literature. 

I am trying to write a sci-fi setting in a not so distant future in which analog signal (brainwaves, in this case) processing is one of the main points of the plot and pretty much required to explain some of the mechanics going on in the universe. Thing is, analog to digital conversion is expensive, and it may compress data into a easier to handle finite set of values that would, in exchange, make it drop some information in the process. This is something I don't want, since some of the mechanics required to develop the plot require subtle differences in a person's brainwaves (in this case, used as some sort of biometric key). This last part can be avoidable by just throwing more resources at a regular digital computer, but that's lazy and something I don't want, as an analog computer could allow for more interesting details and implications. Just how viable would it be for the world to go back to analog? In the past we had analog computers, but we changed to digital because apparently they weren't designed with programmability in mind (as in, they were like ASICs) and soon digital became better than analog so there was no reason to try to improve a deprecated technology. Likewise, most of our telecommunication devices operate on waves and analog signals, but they are translated to digital at some point of the process (ie. the modem) and lose all the properties an analog signal has. DARPA tried to build an analog "cellular neuronal network" CPU (project UPSIDE) for computer vision back in 2012, but there is not much information about it. Apparently, it allows for much faster speeds at a lower energy cost, at the expense of some errors from time to time and what has been described as requiring a much different way of tackling problems. Problem is, it says nothing about how programmable it is (which it apparently is, but it doesn't mention if it's Turing complete by itself or not). In addition, it seems to be a hybrid analog-digital computer, which is the concept I initially thought about including in my story. In the future, could we see the following things? How superior would they be to their digital counterparts? Would they have any limitations? 

Another question concerning the Tetrapi, I would like to know if having haemocyanin-based blood (copper-based blue blood) would be an advantage over having haemoglobin-based blood (iron-based red blood) for an air breathing aquatic species. Is the fact that the majority of animals have red blood grounded in evolutionary pressures or is it just an evolutionary quirk? In a nutshell, do I have to follow strict guidelines or am I spoilt for choice? What I want from you is: Find the most efficient blood type to extract oxygen from an atmosphere composed of 28% Oxygen, 72% Nitrogen, 0.4% Carbon Dioxide and 0.6% other gases with an atmospheric pressure of approximately 0.85atm. Please justify your choice. The answer does not require hard science, although some citations and illustrations would be most helpful. 

Edit: to be more specific, the context and usecase of this technology is that user input is now handled through some sort of a matrix of electrodes implanted into the brain, capable of reading the user's brain activity/thoughts. The software handling the output of this matrix already tries to transform brain activity to some sort of "universal brain language" that covers up the differences between human brains, but still requires an analog/real numbers/wave signal for fine precision (not as in error-free, but as in descriptive) and high throughput. Analog signals were chosen because the brain can easily recover from small errors and discrepancies and because it is more similar to the way the human brain works, but due to limitations of the feedback system, "lag" and slow transmissions is something that you would generally not want to get in your wetware, which is why digital signals were discarded: the electrodes array requires a continuous stream of data, so buffering and processing something to compress it and send it over the network would make the brain "halt" waiting for the next signal, essentially damaging your psyche on the long run (think of becoming deprived of your senses or getting mind-frozen in place every two seconds, which is what the digital transmission could do, compared to seeing some static in your viewport every few seconds, which is what you could get when on analog). This is also the reason computers perform operations on their continuous output analog stream concurrently, to reduce the time the user waits for a reply. It is also the reason all algorithms that directly read from the user wave are also concurrent: it is better to update the wave late than to halt it until the answer is processed. In addition, due to the nature of the brain, a thought or sequence of thoughts can be read and predicted as it is being formed, but can't be confirmed until it is fully formed. This detail is extremely important, as the plot device is based around this fact. Think of the exchange of information between a computer and a human as a regular conversation between two humans (it would be more like telepathy, but for simplicity's sake, let's assume they are just speaking). 

The star is the ship. Gravity is your force field. Your advanced beings have bodies of dark matter or something that doesn't get boiled way, burned, or launched to long distances by contact with hot plasmas. No. Come on. Seriously. If you want your ship to contain all the conveniences of a planet, you build a propulsion system onto an existing minor planet or large asteroid with sufficiently dense composition. If you want your star-faring race to carry a star around with them let them use a star as their vehicle of choice. It could even carry planets as it goes, for real convenience. The only field we known of capable of containing a plasma in sustained fusion reaction without a really strong, rigid, not-invisible frame is gravitational. And if you are going to generate a gravitational field of that size why not just do the way nature does? Let the fuel itself generate the field. Propel it with extreme flares. Maybe give it a neutron companion to use as a valve controller. Refuel it by visiting the center of a galaxy. Travel long distances by the old standard, already mentioned in the question. And, sure, since anything we could build to control the thing would boil away immediately, the race that travels this way has to be of a sort of matter that doesn't, and, since dark matter is a current topic, we borrow that. If we don't do it this way, we still end up relying on stuff we don't understand and have never seen, which brings us back to something equivalent to my suggestion of dark matter. And the stuff still has to be such that it doesn't boil away on contact with plasma, and at the same time it has to be manipulable by ordinary matter intelligent beings, which is begging twice as many questions. So the best solution is just to have the vehicle be a star. 

Computer is just patiently nodding as the human talks to it, representing continuous feedback Human: Del... Computer predictions: I am 85% sure Human is going to ask me about deleting something. Human: Delete... Computer thinks: Deletion command confirmed. Human: Delete file... Computer predictions: I am 70% sure Human will ask to delete a single file. I am 30% unsure about Human asking me to delete a whole filesystem instead. Human: Delete file /home/myUser/delt... Computer thinks: File deletion confirmed. 52 files fulfilling the FILEPATH=/home/myUser/delt* criteria detected. Human: Delete file /home/myUser/delta.bwave Computer thinks: Filepath detected. Request for the deletion of file /home/myUser/delta.bwave confirmed. Initiating deletion. Computer continues nodding for a fraction of a second before replying Computer: File successfully deleted. 

Mind you that while this setting isn't supposed to be hard sci-fi at all, it isn't fantasy science either. Whatever the answers are, they should be at least remotely viable in reality, and more specifically, doable within the following 70 years or less, although computer science could always do some breakthroughs. No suspension of disbelief should be required to enjoy the setting, even if you were somewhat knowledgeable about the field. Note: I guess you could draw some parallels from analog computing to quantum computing, since both seem to work best (or only) on probabilistic algorithms instead of deterministic, but this is not about quantum. Quantum technology exists in this setting, but it's extremely rare and only used in some specific contexts, not to mention most of it is extremely experimental and the general public is oblivious about the existence of the somewhat viable prototypes. 

I have designed an alien species similar to octopi (Tetrapus Sapiens) who live in the tropical waters of a fertile, lush world known as Iridia. The octopi (more like tetrapi) have moved past the hunter-gatherer stage of technology and are currently at a technological level similar to the first Mesopotamian civilisations or ancient Egypt, having devised a writing system of carving, similar to early human civilisations. They have mediocre knowledge of mathematics and science, having devised many diverse languages. Their IQ is 92 (human average 100) yet their EQ is much lower at 73. 'Oral' communication is achieved through colour change, just like cephalopods here on Earth. Tetrapi are highly fond of universal education and discrimination is minimal. Technological progress is relatively fast as they simply cannot understand the concept of strict religious adherence, although they do worship a 'mother' goddess. They also have an 'electric' sense to seek out prey and superb vision in the visible spectrum. Lastly, they have mediocre smell, superb touch, and hearing a bit sharper than humans' though their range is 5hz-10khz. Note: I want every possible communication system that can be mutually used between Homo Sapiens and Tetrapus Sapiens able to convey complex ideas.
