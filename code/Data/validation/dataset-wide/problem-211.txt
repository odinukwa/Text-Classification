Plant Nomads. A group of (probably) small sentient plants with minimal root systems that move around, following water sources and rainy seasons. Stationary Plant Societies. Plants develop a way to pass along knowledge to seeds and send them out, much like coral polyps, to establish new colonies. The older plants would be stationary once their roots developed. Some motion might be possible by selective growth and allowing parts to die. But that would be on a months-to-centuries timescale. 

I think that bacteria are intrinsically better-suited to such environments - by default, there really isn't a "metal-cycle" in the same way as a "water cycle" to supply the raw ingredients. But plants like this would be amazing. You could have junkyard-plants that grow in caves filled with rusty cars and turn them into...tomatoes or something. And heaps of rust. You still need sugar. Ultimately, your plants need carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The exotic elements seem to come in along with one of those three elements. So to answer the question about environment: 

Imagine, if you will, a world where aural communication is impossible. Everything is done through gesture - sign language and written language are common, but the spoken word is not used, and using any sound for communication is not possible. Now, the obvious solution would be to simply make everyone deaf, but that doesn't really sound like fun. I'd like environmental factors to make communication through atmospheric compression (sound waves) impossible. The environment needs to support human life. What atmospheric conditions could cause disruption to compression waves to the point where they could not be used for communication? 

Maybe it was a trick of the light or a strange cloud, or just not enough sleep. A couple nights ago I could have sworn that thin crescent moon flickered. Which led to an interesting question - what conditions could make the moon flicker? Of course, there are all kinds of interesting consequences. I know we have a couple eclipses each year, and the moon has phases, but overall, we take the steady, ethereal glow of the moon for granted. By flicker, I mean off and on within seconds to an hour. The phenomenon must be observed wherever the moon is visible. It can be instant or gradual, but must return to its original state within an hour. I realize the physics of moonlight make this hard, so a habitable Terra-like planet in another system is ok. The moon just needs to be large enough to be extremely obvious and an important part of the night sky, so that its flickering would be impossible to miss. I'd especially like it if this were a recurring event, maybe even a regular feature of the night. Edit: I'm not looking for an explanation of what I saw, that can probably be chalked up to sleep deprivation. I'm looking for a sci-fi or real explanation for a flickering moon. Math not required, just ideas. 

To give your question a sociological answer rather than a geographic one, I think it's possible to have planets with multiple biomes which are, none the less, known as single biome planets. For example, take Africa. How many distinct biomes, cultures, and governments exist in Africa? And how often do people think of or refer to Africa as a single, homogeneous place? It's far away, and we don't consume very much media that is produced there. It takes a lot of effort to have a nuanced view of Africa. That tendency to simplify places which are foreign to us is going to be so much stronger in a galactic empire. Every planet is going to be reduced to a tag line. Desert planet. Ice planet. Jungle moon. Lava world. 

Filters will never fix this problem. The problem is getting oxygen into your blood. Humans can live down to about 40% of sea level pressure. (356 millibars) That's called the Death Zone in mountain climbing. (~8000m on earth). With an oxygen mask, you can survive down to the Armstrong limit, at about 6% of sea level (47 millibars). So, your medieval civilization needs to produce pure oxygen, bottle it and distribute it. That does not sound like medieval technology. Maybe someone with modern understanding of chemistry would be able to do it with medieval tools, but I would still call that modern technology. 

Or Flat Jupiters, maybe. I'm imagining a space station with a large population orbiting very close to a gas giant. The horizon stretches away in all directions and an infinite variety of cloud patterns wiz by below. Some individuals get it in their head that they are flying over an infinite flat plane rather than going around an impossibly large sphere. Assume that, like modern Flat Earthers, they reject information from authorities outside of their social circles and measurements from equipment they can't use themselves. These people also wont or can't (perhaps for economic reasons) leave the space station to view the planetary system from a different vantage point. Is there something about their situation aboard the station that would make it plainly obvious that the planet they orbit is spherical and prevent this idea from spreading? 

Arbitrary "Sea Level". If they are aware of other worlds (perhaps trying to impress a superior power from one of those worlds), they might try to keep the concept of sea level. This would involve guessing at a volume of water and computing where it would rise to, similar to HDE 226868's geoids. Baseline. If the planet is well-explored or relatively flat, they could decide that the lowest point is 0 and measure everything from there. Midline. Similar to baseline, but computing a median height and measuring things from that point as either +/-. Totally arbitrary. I think this is the most likely - for proof, see our measurements of longitude. The scientist who comes up with the concept and popularizes it will choose either the elevation of his own house or the elevation of some important landmark (temple, palace, roadway) as 0 and everything will be based on that for no obvious reason. 

Scanning for life signs seems to focus on self-aware life forms, no matter how primitive. You don't usually hear "scanning for life signs...only deer and whales." In this answer I'm assuming we're reverse engineering already existing technology, not demonstrating feasibility. So from that we can assume that life signs use some form of brainwave sensing. Brain activity does emit some low level signals. Now, the feasibility of detecting such a weak signal from a distance would probably require some preliminary focusing, like heat and/or pulse to locate living things. The way I would design this system is to first do a low-resolution scan for heat, then narrow it by pulse. Finally run the brain waves from those pinpointed locations against known patterns to determine age, health, species, and gender. You could probably determine mental state with such systems. At short range the technology could replace betazoid empath skills. 

Reproduction: Most plants reproduce using insects to transfer vital bits of DNA (trying not to be too graphic). Much of the plant's structure is devoted to this - in fact, anything that isn't root or leaf is probably connected to reproduction. So fruits, flowers, sugar-filled-liquid-producing organs, and bright colors would probably cease to exist if plants had a different way of reproducing. Food: Plants can mostly make their own food. But to do this, they need periods of sun and darkness. Also water, CO2, and O2, if my memory serves correctly. You'll also need a pretty large amount of sun-facing surface. The nice thing with a plant is that mostly they need to make sugar, so carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen are pretty much all they need to function nicely. For repairs, they will need other elements, but these are largely gotten from soil and seem to be widely available. So making food isn't a problem, but storing food could be. Your plant-people will need some type of "camel hump" for sugars. Many plants use roots for this. Water: Plants need a pretty steady supply of water. This seems to be the biggest problem preventing plants from moving - traditionally, a massive root system ensures a steady water supply. Trouble is, massive root systems are hard to move. Plant Society I'm going to keep my imaginary Plantains pretty "planty." Of course, if you want to slap some chloroplasts on an animal, I'm cool with that. But then, it wouldn't really be flora would it? I can see two possible primitive plant societies. Later histories could be extrapolated from these initial points. 

Earth experiences pretty significant tidal forces, and it doesn't seem to affect habitability too much. The crust flexes, the oceans rush in and out, and we're fine. Some life actually relies on it. Io, a moon of Jupiter, experiences significant tidal flexing, enough to generate serious heat and geological activity. So, it seems entirely possible for tidal forces to be strong enough to effect habitability. Constant volcanoes filling the air with ash and toxic chemicals, serious earthquakes moving dirt around and preventing plants from taking hold. So, you're question really boils down to "How strong are the tidal forces experienced by horseshoe moons?" Which is a very difficult question. The strength of tidal force is mostly based on distance, and it can be very difficult to predict how close these moons get to each-other. To get extremely close together, they would have a large difference between the innermost and outermost radius of their orbits. They would approach each other at a higher velocity. They would swap quickly. They would repeat their swaps more often. (relatively, we're still looking at several orbits to complete the swap and several hundred orbits between swaps) A horseshoe orbit that never gets very close is pretty much the same thing, but slower. The two moons are always close to the same distance from the planet. The swap places at a greater distance from each other. Since they interact with each other more weakly, the swap takes longer. It might be tens of thousands of orbits between swaps. tldr; It can probably be whatever you want, but the details are hard. 

A neonatologist (doctor who cares for newborns) I talked to recently pointed out that a larger percentage of babies need serious medical care after being born. This change came about about a generation after some serious improvement in the way we care for premature and sick babies in the 70s and 80s. He concludes that the genes that make it impossible to give birth without the help of advanced medical infrastructure are already spreading in our society. If you take this doctor's assertions to the (possibly ridiculous) extreme, you might imagine a race of highly advanced being with no reproductive organs at all who are only capable of reproducing by combining genetic material in a lab. You and your partner both swab your cheeks, pay the fee, and in nine months the lab calls you in to make you parents. 

Most plants that grow foods are herbaceous, meaning that they have supple stems and die each year, but also that they generally grow relatively fast. Herbaceous plants focus their growth on fruit production at the end of each season. Trees have woody, stiff stems, which allows them to grow taller and survive multiple seasons. They generally grow slower. Trees focus on long-term growth and fruit production is not as important. So plants that stay small and focus on fruit production are good for people food. Plants that focus on growing large don't have excess energy for large-scale fruit production. You're going to need a very specific combination of factors to make this happen. A specific kind of GMO: a tree that has been designed to have the characteristics of an herbaceous plant like fast growth, but later grow stiffer cell walls to help it stay strong and survive multiple seasons (think of tomato plants - they get very large, but crawl or must be supported). A very specific food source: high-density energy sources, either from a very very sunny area or special mineral deposits. But, it's going to need to be in the tropical latitudes. Up in the north there just isn't enough sun to facilitate fast plant growth. 

It took until the 1900s to eradicate wolves in parts of Europe (and in some places they still survive). A creature that was regarded as "more noble" might be protected earlier and not experience such a decline as technology allows better hunting techniques. The interactions will start with the stronger species being dominant, until technology allows the weaker to first develop defensive methods (fire, melee weapons), then offensive methods (distance hunting weapons, traps). Then there will be an era of small scale hunting, which will ramp up as the technology gets better. Hopefully about that time someone will adopt the creature as their coat of arms and become dominant, which will allow at least some to survive in domestication or zoos. Eventually, after significant habitat depletion and extermination, the creatures will be protected by people who don't experience significant impacts from their presence. At that point, survival is pretty likely, preserves will be set up, and they will be studied. Your species just has to survive long enough to get there.
