Firstly a general observation. There can be more than one way correctly to classify an economic policy. One reason is that classifications can be broader or finer (more detailed). Another is that classifications may relate either to the nature of the policy instrument or to the economic objectives of its use. A minimum wage policy typically has the objective of relieving poverty for those in work, so in terms of its objective could be classified as an example of a policy to raise economic welfare (how successful it may be in achieving that objective is a further question). In terms of the nature of the policy instrument, a minimum wage policy could as you say be regarded as a form of price control policy. Price control policy in turn could be regarded as an example of economic regulation, implying direct controls on the operation of particular markets (other examples being import or export quotas and rationing - by the government rather than the market - of scarce goods). However, the objectives of price controls, which include price ceilings as well as price floors, and more generally of economic regulation are often very different to those of a minimum wage policy. For example, price ceilings applying to a wide range of goods have sometimes been adopted as an instrument of counter-inflation policy. 

The answer to this question, which is presumably what Jones means, is that GDP is the same in both countries, because transfer payments are not a component of GDP. Why not? Because although they are expenditure by the government and income to the recipients, they are not directly associated with any element of production or output. Then there is the question about economic effects: 

Suppose we want to estimate a model: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \epsilon_i\tag{1}$ where the $Y_i$ are averages or rates per capita for geographical regions or zones, so that if $Z_i$ is the regional aggregate variable of interest and $P_i$ is population: $Y_i = Z_i / P_i\tag{2}$ If all the variables are accurately measured, and if there exist $β_0^*$ and $β_1^*$ such that for all i: $E[Y_i - \beta_0^* - \beta_1^*X_i] = E[\epsilon_i] = 0\tag{3}$ then OLS estimation of model (1) should yield an unbiased estimate of $\beta_1$. Suppose however that estimates of $P_i$ are only approximate. This is in practice likely since the values of $P_i$ will almost certainly be obtained or derived from census data, leading to several possible sources of error: 

The ratio of government debt to GDP is a useful indicator because, broadly, the larger a country's GDP, the larger is the tax revenue the government could potentially raise to service the debt while maintaining other government expenditure at an acceptable level. Thus a very high debt / GDP ratio would raise doubts about the government's ability to service the debt. One reason why a larger GDP implies a larger potential tax revenue is that most of the transactions making up GDP from an income perspective, eg wages and salaries, company profits, could be taxed. However, taxes could also be levied on items that are not part of GDP, eg capital values of property. The more fundamental point, therefore, is that a larger GDP, again from an income perspective, tends to imply a larger aggregate ability to pay, out of that income, such taxes as may be levied by the government. The government's ability to tax is also influenced by political factors and by the effectiveness of its tax collection, so the debt / GDP ratio can only be a crude indicator of ability to service debt. 

Lack of adequate supporting infrastructure, eg electricity supply unreliable or subject to regular power cuts, unreliable internet service. Lack of adequate skills to maintain and make best use of technology. Limited adoption, eg of smartphones, so that network benefits are not fully realized. Lack of capital equipment, knowledge and skills to produce cutting-edge technology equipment, so that all such technology has to be imported using scarce foreign exchange; or, for slightly more developed countries, production of high-technology goods is limited to low-level assembly work within an international supply chain where most of the value is added elsewhere. 

Housing markets are complex and the following are just some basic points. Key features of houses as economic goods are: 1) their very long life; 2) their differentiation by type and location. In the short run housing supply (the total existing stock, plus any new houses completed) is price-inelastic because the number of new houses can be only a tiny proportion of the existing stock. Hence a short-run analysis of house price changes will focus primarily on short-term changes affecting demand (eg changes in interest rates or in housing-related taxes). In a long run analysis, however, consideration also needs to be given to changes in supply, and to long-term changes affecting demand (eg population growth, rising incomes). Cyclical factors are those that tend to reverse over a period of a few years. The cause of a cycle in a housing market could be internal to that market, eg a self-fulfilling expectation at one time that prices will rise, leading to a price bubble and eventual collapse, as described here. The cause could also lie in the wider economy, eg house prices tending to rise when the economy is booming and fall in a recession. Structural factors are permanent or at least long-lived, eg land availability and planning constraints, housing-related policies that are considered unlikely to change, and the distribution of the existing stock between types and locations. 

The Heckscher-Ohlin Model is normally presented for the case of 2 countries, 2 factors of production and 2 traded goods, leading to statements that, subject to free trade and various other assumptions: 

It's fine to make a supposition that it costs Colombia twice as much to make cars as coffee, and Japan twice as much to make coffee as cars. It's also fine to express these ratios in terms of the respective local currencies. The apparent problem you describe only arises because you go beyond the above and express the costs in terms of a common currency (\$). But in a situation of autarky, there is no way in which the exchange rates needed to convert prices in other currencies to \$ could be determined. Thus your supposition is incoherent. The way in which comparative advantage would be exploited, given the ratios you describe and given free trade, is that the rate of exchange of Colombian to Japanese currency would adjust to a level at which, in both countries, Colombian coffee is cheaper than Japanese, and Japanese cars are cheaper than Colombian. The Colombian car business will then be able to benefit from comparative advantage while not needing to look beyond the relative prices of locally produced and imported cars. Addendum: If, in the past, two countries both used gold as a currency, this would not, given autarky, be equivalent to a common currency. Even if the gold were physically the same, it might just happen (eg for geological reasons) to be scarcer and therefore more valuable in one country than the other. In the absence of international trade and of payment in gold for traded goods, there would be no mechanism to equalize the value of gold in the two countries. It would therefore be feasible that the cost, in terms of their respective gold currencies, of producing every good would be higher in one country than the other. Given free trade, however, the value of gold in the two countries would be equalized at a level at which some goods would be cheaper in one country and some in the other. The mechanism for equalization would be that people and businesses in the more expensive (and therefore more gold-abundant) country, taking their own rational decisions and without any need for central control, would import goods from the cheaper country, paying in gold and therefore causing an outflow of gold to the cheaper country. 

Supply is shown as highly elastic (nearly horizontal) because the UK buys large amounts of its fossil fuels, especially coal, on competitive international markets. In the absence of policy intervention, equilibrium is at point A with consumption and production (assuming no change in stocks) at $Q_A$, which also represents emissions. Note however that while consumption and emissions relate to the UK, production includes amounts produced elsewhere and imported to the UK. The effect of the carbon tax is to raise the supply curve vertically by the amount of the tax. In the absence of other measures, the new equilibrium is at B. Production, consumption and emissions fall to $Q_B$. The cost burden of the tax is mainly shared between users of fossil fuels and consumers of goods produced using fossil fuels, the shares depending on elasticities in particular markets. A share of the burden would also take the form of a fall in the price received by fossil fuel producers, but this would be small given the elastic supply curve. The tax revenue could be used by the government in various ways with various distributional effects. The effect of adding cap-and-trade, assuming an effectively enforced cap at $Q_C$ below $Q_B$, is to limit consumption, production and emissions to $Q_C$. Thus the part of the demand curve to the right of $Q_C$ becomes redundant. Equilibrium is brought about via the market for emissions permits, which will determine a permit price such that supply (post-tax) and constrained demand are in equilibrium at C. Distributional effects depend heavily on the mechanism for the initial allocation of permits. The ‘corporate welfare’ point in BKay’s answer relates most clearly to the case of free allocation. This can be avoided if allocation is by auction, with the revenue accruing to the government with, again, distributional consequences depending on how it is used. Within this model we can infer the following:
