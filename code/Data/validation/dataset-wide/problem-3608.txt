To strengthen your grip for pull-ups, I'd keep it simple. Hang from a bar for as long as you can or a minute, whichever comes first. Repeat for up to 4 sets. This will improve your pull-ups no end. As for your wrist, take it easy and if it gets worse go see a specialist. I've trained a number of people who have had wrist pain when they first start calisthenics, make sure you do some wrist circles before you start to warm-up. Usually it clears up after a few weeks once they start to adapt to the exercises, but as I say if not then drop it back and go see a specialist.

I wrote a beginners guide to calisthenics on my site a couple of months ago. (Edit to add the workout) The basic format is 5 sets x 5 reps of the following exercises: Incline Push-ups Inverted Rows Bodyweight Squats Lying Leg Raises Short Bridges However if you can do chin-ups you're possibly a bit ahead of this. I do recommend you train for bridges though, they'll work your legs in a way that shouldn't put too much pressure on your knees. As for rest periods, that depends on your goals and training plan. If you're training for strength over muscle, then keep your reps low and your sets high. This will allow you to train more often. If you're training for muscle mass then make sure you have good rest periods to let your muscles recover. You should also train higher reps, 10-15 is a good amount, with only 2-3 sets. Either way, unless you're looking to build stamina, I wouldn't go over 20 reps. Once you can do this amount then perform a harder exercise instead. 

One of the reason why masturbation is believed to have an effect on muscle gains is because it influences the testosterone levels. Recent research suggest that natural levels of testosterone simply have no effect on muscle gains. 

I think I'll write an answer out of my comment to be able to explain a bit further, because you didn't rule it out. Maybe your legs are unevenly long, this is a pretty common problem. No ones legs are equally long, but for the most people the difference is too small to be noticed. I never noticed it for myself, neither did my father who is a physician, and I never had problems with it when I was young. Maybe it developed during puberty. When I was 19 however during medical examination for medical service – serving was mandatory in Germany back then – the physician told me that my legs were differing in length, with the right leg about 1cm shorter. Up until to that moment I had never noticed this and I really didn't care about it afterwards. Some, maybe three years ago, I started to feel pain in my pelvis and my the adductors in the right leg. It wasn't a really stinging pain but just annoying, so I ignored it for a long time. This year after I started being more active and feared that I could suffer long term damage and not be able to continue my sports, I finally decided to visit a Sports Medicine Doctor. He was not able to confirm the difference in my legs any more, because my pelvis has wrangled itself to even the shorter leg out. This causes higher stress on the tendons and especially the points where the muscles are connected to the bones, as these spots get twisted. There is no good way I know of to diagnose it yourself as the pelvic might have adapted to the problem. I never really experienced the pain to worsen after any cardio activity (cycling, swimming, running), it was just there before and afterwards. But I think that one squatting session I did two weeks ago (without weights) however lead to increased pain. If you can exclude all other factors, you might see a professional to have this condition checked. I have no idea who, other than a Sports MD is fit to diagnose this, Physiotherapists might be able, too. 

I teach my students using a mixture of wall pistol squats and partner assisted pistol squats. With wall pistols, simply squat down onto a low object such as a wall, once you can do 5x5, go a little lower. Partner assisted you simply hold your partners hand, and then use them to assist pulling yourself up, try to use as little assistance as you require. On top of that, make sure you're keeping good form. Your knee should track along the line of your toes and not fall inwards and your body should remain upright, not leaning to one side. 

The best bodyweight book I've read is Convict Conditioning by Paul Wade, this is the book that got me into calisthenics in the first place. I can also recommend all of Al Kavadlo's books as well as the Naked Warrior by Pavel Tsatsouline. The PCC blog has some excellent tutorials. Check out my own website Maximum Potential Calisthenics which features a number of tutorials including a beginners guide. 

Sounds like you're ready to start muscle-up training, your numbers are decent enough (5 sets of 5 is my target before I move my students to muscle-up training). Add in some jumping muscle-ups to your workout routine. You're going to need a false grip on the bar, which means putting your thumbs and palm on the bar, rather than your fingers. This allows you to transition easier. For the jumping muscle-ups, start off in front of the bar. This is really important, as in a muscle-up you pull backwards, rather than upwards like a pull-up. So set yourself in front of the bar, with your hands in a false grip. Then explosively jump backwards and up. Kick your knees up and bring your arms down as fast as you can. Once your chest is past the bar, do the fastest sit-up you can imagine and you'll be over the bar. Combine this will kipping pull-ups and keep practising. EDIT: Here is a video tutorial I posted on how to do a jumping muscle-up $URL$ 

I am taking most of the data from Wikipedia here, but most consider this common knowledge anyway. The BMI or Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your squared height in meters. 

Because the english wikipedia is pested by bad references (mostly third class fitness sites that oversimplify the whole thing) I will cite from the German Wikipedia (with translation by me). 

I have seen protein suggestions based on all kind of factors: body weight, lean body weight or lean body weight modified by muscle mass. The only one of those you can reliably measure is body weight. Body fat measurements are not really accurate and as a result you'd get an inaccurate lean body weight number. Same goes for determining the muscle mass. On top of that body shapes vary. There are people with longer or bigger muscles and people that have thinner or smaller ones. Some people are just more bulky than others depending on their genes. How the protein metabolism works isn't completely understood, too. And lastly not every protein source is as valuable as the other. What counts are the amino acids that make up the different types of protein. There are some types with a high value protein profile and some with lesser value. A combination of two proteins with a low value protein profile can however result in a high value profile, just because the proportions of essential amino acids evened each other out. It would be really complex to put all those factors into a formula to calculate a specific result. Still that formula wouldn't be very accurate. It is easier and saves you a lot of time to make some assumptions on most of these variables and only use the number with the highest effect - body weight - to calculate your protein needs. In fact the 2g/kg are the maximum that can effectively be used in muscle protein synthesis. Everything above that value isn't necessarily going to waste, but probably just converted to energy. So instead of recommending you something that might be insufficient, Starting Strength just goes with the maximum as their simple estimation to be on the safe side. Unless you have kidney problems, a balanced diet high in protein is safe.
