Also when you have the perception of self you have a yard stick which you use to measure other people, their actions, standing, wealth, etc. with respect to you. This creates misery. If you drop the yard stick then you get out of misery. Having said this though there is no lasting entity as you there is a mind matter process. What ever you do becomes fabrications which at that point influence the process and also has a "loop back" at different times. 

What you have is a perception or nartion of self. With the cessation of perception your perception or notion of self disappears. In the conventional sense we have the perception of self. Conventional wisdom is what can be perceived within the field of perception, out of which entity view is one such item. At the ultimate level there is no self. That is the realisation after the cessation of perception or knowledge beyond the field of perception. Self view being a perception when perception ceases so does the identity view. 

The fact that the Buddha could perform these miracles should be taken in the light to strengthen your devotion to the Buddha. If this is for pure delight or intellectual stimulations in miracles like watching or reading about magic or watching a magic show, this is the wrong motivation to investigate about it. Having said the there is a Wikipedia page on miracles the Buddha performed including the twin miracle. I am not exactly answering your question here but I hope this adds value. 

Atman - View there is a Soul or Entity. Here the belief is there either controllable, non changing entity. (Entity view.) Bhava - Becoming or creating further existences. This is a process under which your next moment is create through the rolling of the Dependent Origination (DO). This is like a stochastic process. (Process view.) In simple terms the general tendency is the look at a being as an Entity but actually there is a Process (Bhava) which does not properties you associate with and Entity (Atman). 

In short, the Buddha said, there is one path for the purification of beings. Some meditation techniques the objective is blissful states. Buddhism does not say there is one path for this. Some of that the Yogis teach might very well work for this but if you are looking for the Buddhist goal of Nirvana there is only one path. What a Yogi teachers you may take you to some other goal like birth in Deve or Brahma realm but this is not the Buddhist goal. For the Buddhist goal of Nirvana there is only one and only path. The path of the Yogis is futile in trying to achieve the Buddhist goal through they may achieve what the goal of the technique is supposed to achieve. 

Cetasikas can be put into 3 main division: feeling, perception and fabrications. It is the mental proliferation and volitional activities which create the fabrications. This might be the key elements in trying to piece together how it related to Dependent Origination. 

Look where you mind goes. If it jumps to a pain know you attention is on the pain. If it is a thought know that it is with the thought. If your attention is on a ___ just know that your attention is with ____. With each object your mind jumps to there is a sensation attached. If it a pain it is unpleasant. If it is sweet memory it is pleasant. If it is a birds chirping it can be neutral. What ever that grabs your attention just know the sensation. In all these cases for each sound you experience though through your physical senses there is a metal reaction also which is also either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. You should maintain equanimity so you do not get the mental reaction. In addition try to see in impermanence of each experience. All experience has a start, middle and and end. Also if you diver the sensation into smaller areas and examine them, large sensation is made up of smaller sensations clusters which shorter lived than the affected area. You can continue this division seeing more subtler and subtler clusters until you come to a level it is indivisible and changes seem unimaginably rapid. In addition you will see because of stimuli at the sense faculty only the some sensation started and when that simply subsides the stimuli the sensation disappears. You are not in control of the stimuli nor the pleasant experiences which you might want to prolong or unpleasant which you might want to shorten or get rid of. Also developing the Jhana factors of: 

Madhu,piṇḍika Sutta You have no control over awareness. Say you hear a unpleasant sound. You cannot command: "Stop hearing!". If you hear something pleasant you cannot command: "Do not stop!". Also when say watching something interesting. Memories and thoughts may arise which takes you attention from what you are watching. You cannot command: "Stay with watching only!". This lack of control makes this partly unsatisfactory. Even the observer is: 

There is nothing in the above which a lay person cannot develop or not reap benefits by developing. Being a monk you have less responsibilities hence more time to practice. The key is to practice regardless of whether you are lay or a monk. 

Firstly you listen to the Dhamma and see that this sounds right Secondly you see this is logical when you think and analyse it Lastly you should practice and see for your self then you know that in fact it is right by direct experience hence faith becomes unshakable 

You start with Body mindfulness as the breath is the body fabricator. Then you move to Sensation Then Mental objects Then Mental content 

In my opinion there should be no changes from school to school. Conventional reality is what is within the field of Perception. Ultimate reality is things not comprehended or understood within the field of Perception. 

Any mental state (Citta) or content (Cetisaka) give arise to some feeling either pleasant, neutral or unpleasant. (Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma) Even thoughts are sensed or felt thought the mind sense door which re perceive and react resulting in these sensations. Hence what you can easily recognise is the sensations pertaining to the thoughts. 

Once I heard that in early Indian kings use to take a drink in the evening. The Buddha was careful not to introduce this precept in early day of his teaching until most of the Kings, ministers and tycoons where his disciples. Later when this happened this was introduced. If this was prematurely introduced many who were taking habitual or customary drinks might not have been inclined to listen to the Dhamma. This is just a theory to explain the lack intake of intoxicants in some Suttas some which were early days of the dispensation. 

It is difficult to find archaeological evidence on this especially in the ME due to current situations. Also many might have been destroyed as Buddhism was there very early on. But references like: 

If you look at dependent origination and the Nidānas closely, craving arises due to feeling. You analyze the feeling and classify it as something desirable or undesirable or neither desirable or undesirable. These cravings can be: 

You should experience the whole breath from start to finish experiencing the effects of the whole breath and body for each in and out breath. If possible try to experience the heart beat and flow of oxygen in and out of the body. You should calm the body by looking intensely at any gross solidified sensations on distraction and bring the attention back to the breath or any thoughts which might increases the speed of the breath thus making the sensations related to formations more and more subtle as your old formations pass away. You look at sensation in the body when any of you sense doors come in contact with any object as well as sensations due to formation and the sensation that follow through your metal reaction to it. For each such reaction note this and then bring your attention back to the breath. You should actively look at the sensation and how your perception causes a metal reaction creates sensation to which you cling. By practising non reaction and perhaps cultivating notions and perception which are opposite in your polarity of your perception to neutralise it. Also look at you sensation without reaction so the gross sensations pass away and more subtler and more subtler sensation arise. In this process your your mental fabrications will subside and feeling and perception will subside. You should look at your mind jumping from one object to another. Note the sensation when it comes in contact followed by recognition and reaction. When you see something, you will get a sensation around your eyes and then around your head both which resonates through out your body. Always bring back to your attention to the break after noticing the object your mind runs to until the mind wonders away less and less thus reducing verbal fabrications and increasing concentration. You should note sensations arising from contact and from formation arise and pass away. You are not in control of any such experience. Thus you cannot get ever lasing satisfaction from such experience. You should cultivate mental detachment from any experience as they are impermanent and not under your control. Any reaction to any sensations will lead to mental formations misery. 

When you are with the 4 foundations of mindfulness you are with the present moment. This way there is no room to misinterpret reality. Also it is best that you seek a good meditation instructor who can guide you in this case. Some on you can approach and reach out when there is a issue. 

(Cattaro) Padhana Sutta - The Discourse on the (Four) Exertions In the Abhi Dhamma we discuss 121 mind states which are either promoted or unpromoted. If if is good volition and we are lazy we should prompt or motivate ourselves to follow through and if it is un prompt then we should not obstruct it. Conversely true of bad volitions. So what on maintaining what you are good at and also develop in things you are not good at when the actions or motivations behind it is good. Do the opposite when it is not the case. 

For ease of translations all this concepts are summarily is translated to the English sometimes as non - self when it comes to Annatta. So starting with logical reasoning by replacing the actual meaning of the English rendering of the word taking its literal English meaning leads to flawed logic. 

Sati is useful to reduce though proliferation and eliminate Sankhara that follows. Make it pratice you review (paccavekkhana / vīmamsa) if you are mindful at defined intervals like end of each in or out breath cycles. This will help you strengthen your mindfullness. The description of how to review is found in Knowing and See, 4th edition by Ven. Pa Auk Sayadaw p. 35 onwards though is a slightly different context. Sometimes it might be worthwhile to try a Samatha meditation subject in these situations. 

Identification is due to notion or perception. How do dis-identify is by cultivating opposite perception as in Girimananda Sutta. Also perception results in conditioned metal reaction which creates sensations followed by formations when you react to the sensation. Much of these sensations are generally around the head based on the volitional formation. These can be dissolved slowly by brining your attention to them maintaining equanimity and knowing their 3 characteristics. 

Say you are incapable of solving a problem. Ignoring it will also not solve it. You are hurt by it. Maintaining a sound balance of the mind will immunise some of metal pain when thing go wrong. Buddhism is to keep your head straight when things don't go as you want them. You should do your best to overcome them. If they do not work as you intend, then you have to minimise or eliminate your unhappiness by trying to maintain a sound mind. 

Buddhist meditation is about taking the bull by the horn, not suppressing or avoiding. Suppression and avoidance lead to unwholesome roots. 

At least in Sri Lanka there is no notion or any specific time before one should be send to the morgue. There always a change when some one is pronounced dead is not actually dead but declared so as an error. Best is to wait a enough to ensure that some one pronounced dead is in fact actually dead. 

Giri-m-Ananda Sutta has details of how to overcome illness. At a superficial level you can start as following and go deeper as in the Sutta. Also there is a book Meditation on Perception: Ten Healing Practices to Cultivate Mindfulness by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana which might be of interest. 

In addition to what @to mentions: Buddhism differs from Hinduism. Hinduism has the notion of Atman as a central teaching. Buddhism does not. Though Hindu practices you can reach Samadhi at the most. You cannot achieve Nirvana in the Buddhist sence since it lacks Vipassana. Hence they are very different. 

Your awareness and focus should be on arising and passing of phenomena pertaining to the 4 foundations of mindfullness (impermanence if you still cannot see arising and passing of phenomena) with strong equanimity towards sensations and maintaining your mind free from clinging and craving. It is not the task that you should be absorbed in but experiencing phenomena as they come and go. Also any of the 4 foundations of mindfullness you have to experience at the experiential level hence through sensations. E.g. if you are looking at your body posture then it should be the outline of sensations that you experience through your sense faculties that any conceptualization of the particular posture. What ever task you do keep looking at phenomena / sensations / elements arising and passing equnimously then it is enough. You can even multi task. 

When you have a Sensation couple with Perception what happens is that you react to the Sensation with Clinging or Aversion. In Nirvana your Perception an Sensation momentarily stops when you realise it (pala samapathi) and when you come out your perceptions are for ever changed. Hence you do not react to Sensation the same way as before thus not creating new fabrications. When you are in the attainment of the fruit (pala samapathi) there is no sensation but out of it you have Sensation but doe not react to it the same way as your Perception has changed. The roller coaster of sensation we create through becoming has lost its fuel when you attain Nirvana. The creation of new fabrications have stopped. The fabrications give Unpleasant, Pleasant and Neutral Sensations when they bear fruit. What ever the sensation it is Unsatisfactory. The bliss in Nivana is you have come out of this and the fire of fabrications which keep burning in Unsatisfactoriness is withering out. When you are sans of Perception you do not see things through coloured glasses hence there is no distortion of the 3 poisons. This result in that you are not creating any new fabrications, hence free from the Unsatisfactoriness inherent to getting hit by the waves of one sensation after the other. 

The above is from: Pacala Sutta on Sloth and Torpor but can be generalised to the other hindrances. A general outline of how the 5 hindrances can be eliminated is found in Nīvarana,pahana Vagga and also following 6 essays Nīvaraṇa, Kāma-c,chanda, Vyāpāda, Thīna,middha, Uddhacca,kukkuca, Vicikicchā by Piya Tan. Now coming to when you cannot meditate. Insight meditation is to experience things as they are. When you say you can't meditate, it looks like you are trying to do something during meditation. Just relax and stay with what you experience (reality as it is) to the best extent you can. Also there are many meditation subjects. Change of subject also might help. Also have 2 sessions of meditation per day at the end of the day and beginning of the night (evening) and end of the night and beginning of the day (morning). If this case one session would probably be more productive than the other if you have a storm in one session.
