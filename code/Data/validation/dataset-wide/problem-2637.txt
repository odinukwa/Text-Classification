Yes. Both features of the relations of ideas, analyticity and a-priority, are spelled out in ยง30 of the Enquiry, a bit after the one you quoted from. Hume associates relations of ideas with demonstrative reasoning: 

No, you are correct. These are not the only two approaches to the existence of fictional objects. This SEP article contains a review of contemporary positions and arguments, regarding fictional (imaginary) objects. Four main positions are discussed: Possibilism: fictional objects are possible entities, Meinungianism: fictional objects are actual entities, Creationism: fictional objects are author dependent entities, Anti Realism: fictional objects are not entities (they do not exist). Russell's approach, and Quine's in his footsteps, fall under anti-realism concerning fictional objects. So there are (at least) two extant approaches to fictional objects beside Russell's (= Quine's) and Meinung's. 

An obvious non-divine standard of good/evil is that found in Buddhist thought and philosophy: A state is evil because it leads to suffering; a state is good because it leads to happiness. In Buddhism, morals are both absolute and utilitarian; evil states can never lead to happiness, so they are intrinsically evil - but only for that reason, not based on any external authority. External authority for good/evil would actually be a subjective standard; it seems to me you are begging the question by asserting divinity to be objective. 

The language in the first statement is meant to invoke a hypothetical scenario, whereas in the second I am merely making a statement about the world as it currently is. The difference has to do with the truth value of the statement itself. A Material Conditional statement is true as long as for every situation in which the first part is true, the second part is also true. It makes no guarantees about the logical coherence of the statement when applied to hypothetical situations. Technically any statement of P->Q is true as long as either P is false or both P and Q are true, regardless of whether or not there is any causal connection between P and Q. A Counterfactual is making a statement about necessity that states that regardless of the current truth value of P, if things were ever in a condition in which P were the case, Q would also be the case. Here is an example I stole from wikipedia to illustrate the difference: Counterfactual: If I were in Poland, I would be in Europe. (true, though the method to evaluate such truth is hotly contested) Material Conditional: If I were in Poland, I would be in Africa (also true, because I am not in Poland so this has no binding effect on the truth or falsehood of the second part) What we usually want when we discuss things in real life is the counter-factual. It is not making a claim about the real world only, but also about hypothetical ones. This is how we usually think and what we mean in colloquial speech when we say "If... then..." most of the time. 

A predicate Q, or a description "the Q", are called self contradictory iff any attempt to use them will entail a self contradiction. This is the sense in which "the set of all sets" has been proved to be self contradictory. 

Further, "doing philosophy" has here a relevant narrow sense: uncovering language games, as a central therapeutical tool of philosophy, a-la Wittgenstein in PI. Contrasting descriptions with explanations is just one more way in which Wittgenstein expresses one of the central theses of PI, which is in direct opposition with his earlier views: language games have no "depth", i.e. no deep, hidden structure. Nothing is hidden from (the common, public) view. There are no deep, underlying logical and/or rational structures, of the kind that he argued for in the Tractatus, behind language games. This is, then, the meaning of the assertion that there is nothing to explain, only something to describe. And it also turns out, so Wittgenstein repeatedly tells us, that these mere descriptions are not at all easy to produce. 

It seems to me that property cannot be considered an intrinsic part of human nature, not in the way life is, for example. Property defines a relationship between two objects that only has a basis in the minds of humans themselves. So, the question is, is the defining of this relationship a "rightful" mental act? I.e., when a person claims ownership over an object, whether the situation makes it a valid claim or not, is such a claim generally right? Meaning, in a practical context, are groups of human beings warranted in developing property laws in general, based on some absolute principle, or is property rather, as James Madison called monopolies in general, "among the greatest nuisances in government" (i.e. a necessary evil)? The reason I am asking, though I'd rather it didn't interfere too much with the answering, is because of how this relates to modern property law, which seems to have developed a sort of righteousness of its own, as though it were based on some intrinsic right to property. If it is true that property rights are only a convention with the intent of forwarding some general purpose of harmony and human development, then the arguments in favour of extended copyright and patents seem much weaker than if property rights are intrinsic. Obviously, I have my own thoughts on this question, but what I'm really looking for is the thoughts of the "greats". If anyone can give me an idea of the sorts of things wise people have said on the subject of property in general, that would be a great help. 

Nothing really hinges on Quine's choice of the Homeric Gods for the example. At most one could say that Quine picked a bad example. Furthermore, the remark about the Homeric Gods is not part of Quine's main argument. The main argument is against the analytic/synthetic distinction, and comes earlier in the esssy. The Homeric Gods reveal themselves at the end of the essay, within the concluding remarks, after the heavy lifting has already been done. 

I think that the word "informer" has here its usual meaning: a spy, a person who pretends to be on your side, but secretly intends to harm you. This interpretation will account well for Socrates's reactions to Thrasymachus's accusations (emphases mine): 

Yes. The most obvious and quick answer to your question is: Do you know for sure that there is no Strong AI in existence right now? If your answer is no (which it should be), then you must also believe that it is possible for Strong AI to exist without us being certain that it can exist. Another, more long-winded one: Based on the constraints of your scenario, this happens in a world in which Strong AI is possible. In such a world, the entirety of intelligence and consciousness are nothing more than physical processes. IE: The physicalist approach to the mind/body problem is the correct one. I suppose one could argue that Strong AI doesn't require a mind to exist, but I feel like if you redefine Strong AI that way you're not talking about what we normally think of as Strong AI. If this is the case, then there is no fundamental difference between the thoughts of a person and the actions of a computer, we're just programmed differently. While the effects of the algorithm, or the effects of human thought are difficult or impossible to predict with precision, the fact remains that they are purely the result of physical processes. The system, while perhaps very very complex, ultimately boils down to interactions between molecules. So the question of whether we will "realize" that Strong AI is possible is unrelated to the truth-value of whether it is possible, our "realizations" are merely a complex interaction of molecules. There is no reason to suspect that the existence of AI will send out molecules/waves of light that will interact with the cells in our brains in such a way that we will "realize" that it is possible to create AI. 

G. E. Moore takes up, in "Proof of an External World" (1939) Kant's challenge to prove the existence of "the external world". A necessary preliminary step is to clarity just what "the external world" is taken to mean. Moore intends a characterization as general as possible of "the external world", without getting into any avoidable metaphysical commitments. The "external world" is roughly the physical world, but without any reference to actual physical concepts. That is because the philosophical proof is largely independent of physics, in the sense that the proof should hold even if the actual physics were very different than what it actually is. To prove the existence of "the external world" would be to prove the existence of objects in space. It is for these that Moore chooses the formulation "objects that are met with in space". By that he means, on the one hand, objects that are not necessarily "physical bodies" (bodies are, roughly, objects that can be manipulated directly by interaction), but also merely optical "objects" such as shadows and rainbows. 

This is interesting to me, as it would seem that without an ability to freely choose between alternative explanations according to which seems more reasonable, rational thought is undermined. I am trying to work my way through portions of Critique of Pure Reason, but I am having trouble getting my head around it. Can anyone explain Kant's view that rationality and determinism are compatible, if the above quote indeed does reflect Kant's view? If it is somehow incorrect, can anyone explain what he actually held to be the case? 

That seems to depend on the specific tradition in question. If the said tradition has internalized (or is willing to internalize) norms of conceptual change, then conceptual change is possible, to that extent. Nothing in Brandom's system prevents it. There is also always the possibility of starting or maintaining a new tradition-branch. Brandom's view requires a social structure, but it does not require a unified consensus. Notice also that there is a kind of (intended) circularity about this idea that you look at previous uses of a concept, in order to judge its correct use in a novel case. Because what does it mean that the new case is novel, except that there are no precedents for it? That is, until one "re-interprets" past cases as precedents. By re-interpreting past cases as relevant precedents, one is not merely continuing the tradition. One is then actively participating in making the tradition. 

Interesting question :) but lies and concealment have to be lying about and concealing something, no? Once all the lying and concealing has being eradicated, there is still the object of the lying and concealing, viz. the truth. For example, it is true that "Greek word for truth is แผฮปฮฎฮธฮตฮนฮฑ". Is that truth defined merely by the absence of anyone lying about it or concealing it? It seems that if truth is simply the absence of lying, kindness will be simply the absence of cruelty, love the absence of hatred, etc., and these are patently false. Just because something has an opposite doesn't necessitate its existence being defined by that opposition.
