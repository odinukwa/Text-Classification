Well, it all has to do with RATE of FIRE. Does your airship have capabilities equivalent to the US AF AC-130, which is capable of blowing to smithereens a football-field's worth of enemy combatants every second? Most importantly can you blow enemy flyers out of the sky before they get within range? Does your Big Bertha-like mega-canon fire at 200 km ranges and leave a 100 meter crater where the enemy general's HQ tent used to be? And then can fire again, a minute later? If it can be this precise and accurate, Big Bertha is the way to go. Does your Spellarm tower have the capability of sustained fire? Is it a ray of death, dancing merily amidst the burning or panicked and fleeing soldiers of the enemy camp? Does lifting one's head above the trenches for a single second leave a charred stump where the soldier's head used to be? Spellarm towers it is. Given equal rates of fire (casualties per second) the Airship has the advantage of mobility, and the disadvantage of being within line of sight. Perhaps it can be disabled by enemy mages? Given equal rates of fire, the Big Bertha has the advantage of causing utter horror out of the blue, with no possible defense. Especially given the massed troop formations common in medieval-tech armies, this should be horrifying to enemy leaders. However, this comes with significant supply issues (must have a steady supply of 1,000-7,000 kg high-explosive rounds. Some of these are about the size of a passenger car. Not an easy ask for a rencently medieval tool-kit. Given equal rates of fire, the ray-towers would make a traditional siege of your capitol virtually impossible, since any open structures in line of sight would be vulnerable, the most common medieval construction materials are either flammable (wood and hides), can be melted through (iron), or cannot be produced in sufficient quantities fast enough to shelter a million-man army (porcelains and baked clay). However, they are obviously immobile, so no offensive capabilities and no use beyond direct line of sight. The enemy might be seizing your mines and killing your peons, if it's around the nearby mountain, you're helpless to do anything. All in all, if all solutions had similar killing power (casualties per second), I'd go for the airship. If you are in a defensive mind-set and worried about sieges, the light-towers will help. If you just want to rain death upon enemies within a 50 mile range and have the industrial chops to supply the shells it needs, definitely go for the mega-cannon. 

At this point, the only people awake are your people, your casualties are the guards plus any tech who didn't want to go into SA, and so long as the authorities planet-side aren't tipped off, you're good to go. 

I think you've got yourself in a bit of a corner. Without FTL, trading would be nomadic rather than what we think of today - think the old Silk Road, or traveling peddlers. It'll be people whose livelihood involves being constantly on the move, buying stuff here hoping it'll sell for more than that on the other end. (This of course assumes that we don't have transmutation or anything). It may be more feasible if it's combined with an entertainment troupe of some sort (circus being the classic, but even postWW1 barnstormers would fit the model). But, this assumes that it's cost-effective to be roaming the stars in the first place, and that means while you don't need FTL, you do need some sort of high-efficiency power source and sub-light propulsion. Otherwise, it's not worth the trip at all for most things. If we're use near-now tech, that means the only things that are even worth considering shipping is things that the destination planet can't get on their own. (Because if it's available on-planet or even in-system at all, it's cheaper to do it locally than it is to ship it). To my mind, that brings you to three things: 

There is a vast, vast amount of matter in the Solar system, some of it conveniently outside of the massive gravity wells of the rocky and giant planets, so it's not an insane guess to expect that we'd use Asteroid Belt matter first, then the even larger Oort cloud resources. Obviously we wouldn't just make a Great Leap Forward and become a Type II overnight. We'd first have to reach Type I, defined roughly as making use of the resources of a home planet. If we take the Yearly solar irradiance of Earth, at $5.5Ã—10^{24}J$, we still have a ten-thousand fold growth curve to ascend to even reach Type I. To do a Fermi simplification, let's assume 100% capture efficiency, so if you built solar panels at the Mercury perihelion, to reach Type I via solar you'd need 12 million sq. km. of panels, which is in the same order of magnitude as the area of Europe. Might seem like a lot, and it would doubtlessly require far more resources than we can currently even dream about harnessing, but the area of a sphere at the orbit of Mercury's perihelion is about 6.6e15 sq. km, so you've only built about 2 billionths of a Dyson sphere. Yeah, space is BIG. You can see from that that you can go a long way towards a Dyson sphere before anything at all would be noticeable on Earth, and with some level of planning, you can ensure that even a near-complete Dyson sphere does not shade Earth (or the other planets) at all. We got a long way to go. 

People - colonists, refugees. Yes, you can "manufacture" them on-site, but assuming the travel time is < 20 years (or just for bootstrapping a new colony), you have to get people from there to here. Bootstrapping for a colony - basically, the stuff you need to build the stuff you need. Once a colony is established, this market dries up entirely, but for a colony that can't do X, a machine to let them do X is worth shipping. Unobtainium. Which goes back to the "can't get it here" issue. If some colony finds Dune Spice and it's useful enough, there will be people willing to pay the transport costs to get it. (Credit to R. in the top-post comments). Refugees - by which I mean folks who aren't trying to go somewhere, so much as needing to get away from where they started. In this context (esp. given the money needed to build this sort of thing), you're probably looking at some rich religion/orthodoxy that builds something relatively self-supporting so they can bugger off and find a brave new land (or Xenu or whatevs). It's crazy and most of them probably won't make it, but human history is full of people packing up and hoping for the best. 

Perhaps we are simply projecting our own misunderstanding of the universe and our limited goals upon beings beyond our comprehension. Our grasp of the goals and means of action of entities many orders of magnitude beyond us is tenuous at best. Just like a hunter-gatherer asked about a terrible weapon would imagine a giant or very sharp axe, or a very precise arrow, but could not possibly even conceive of something like a nuclear explosive, so is our imagination limited by our technology and primitive culture. More appealing destinations. Perhaps a post-singularity society will simply find it easier to travel to parallel dimensions, tap into nearby universes, assault Heaven (or Hell), or Hal only knows what else. More subtle forms of colonization. Or perhaps they will simply transcend physical form, making the question pointless. Who knows what civilizations might be embedded into what we in our ignorance call the Higgs field, for example. Perhaps the Electroweak breakdown into electromagnetic and weak forces was an epochal and universe-wide civil war. 

The key point is What does everyone actually know? - and then controlling what they learn and how they interpret it. I don't live near Philly, so anything I'm going to hear about this will be via news reports. I'm literally only going to know what the media tells me. Easy-as-pie in this world of gag orders and national security letters. On the other extreme, anyone close enough to get a clear look at it was likely in the blast radius and thus not in a position to talk to anyone. In the middle are folks who would have saw the streaking light coming down. (Think of that meteor that hit Russia a few years back - even the folks who had cameras pointing at it just see a bright something coming down, then big boom). You simply call it whatever you want it to be called - meteor, nuclear attack, whatever your sneaky government masters want to spin it as. (And even from a kilometer away, you're not going to see much detail, particularly at speed) You mention that satellites caught details. While I think you're overestimating what a satellite can capture (relative speed is a bit of a bitch in photographing things in orbit, especially unexpected things), most of your serious cameras are government controlled. The rest are corporate, which brings us back to government nastygrams telling you that you had an unfortunate data outage, and you have NO IMAGES FROM THAT POINT OF TIME. Now, you just have a disaster scene, and it's pretty easy at this point. Lock down the area, close the roads, send in FEMA and the nuclear guys and everything else. Rig some gadgets to make clicky noises and declare an emergency evac. Get everyone out. Meanwhile, a bunch of MIBs in hazmats happily take care of the "suspect material". To sum up: 

If a single mage can nuke an entire army, obviously they will rule, if only to keep other genocidal powerhungry mages in check. Motivation to rule Think about it. Why do these magicians study magic? For the sake of learning alone? Or out of greed for power? If you study continuously for 200 years and then you die of old age, what have you accomplished? Unless the study of magic is so rewarding as to be addictive (i.e. mages wake up every morning thinking of nothing but learning more magic, morning after morning after morning, their entire lives), then the accumulation of magical power will be (also) a means to an end. There is an obvious heterogeneity of preferences and circumstance among regular people (some choose to become criminals, other mercenaries, others to be doctors). If the genetic (or whatever) factors that make one into a mage are randomly distributed in your population, of course you'll get mages with a variety of interests. There will thus inevitably be some ruthless psychopathic power hungry mages that will literally try to take over the world. Since it's unlikely that the very first powerful mage will have been a psychopath (or is it?), presumably the devastation wrought by the powerhungry will have forced even the less politically inclined into action to stop their rampage (if only out of sheer self-preservation). How does magic start? Since any noticeable magic requires serious study and experiment over decades, it's somewhat unlikely that you would have mages come into their powers in pre-agricultural societies, since among hunter-gatherers you don't have enough specialization of labor to afford a class of people dedicated to such (slow payoff) lifelong study. So the magi would be an outgrowth of the shamanic (part-time specialist) and priestly (full-time specialist) classes in ancient society, or if magic requires a quasi-scientific method, they would start off even later in human history, perhaps initially a subset of monks and court scholars. Does the first mage control all others? It's easy to imagine that with a century's head start, the first mage would be able to dominate the minds of secular rulers and younger mages alike, if they were so inclined. However, I find it more likely that magic starts off in a similar fashion to the scientific revolution, where a wide array of distant scholars enthusiastically correspond on their initially small discoveries ("Treatise on the Magickal Lighting of a Match"), so effective magic emerges in many locations with near peers. Political organization How you go from here depends on how magic scales with age and learning. You have to decide. Is your average 170 year old mage exponentially more powerful (godlike) than a 70 year old, or simply a bit stronger (once or twice stronger)? Are power limitations in any way innate? Is there such a thing as extraordinary natural talent? That will determine whether you get a Gerontocracy (where the oldest mages rule), an Aristocracy (where the strongest mages by talent rule), or some general direct democracy or Althing (if none has an overwhelming advantage, it is a stable arrangement if each mage has a near-equal say). Obviously, they will have administrators and non-magical keepers of the peace (possibly magically enhanced with weapons and amulets if the setting allows it to give them an edge), to allow themselves to dedicate more time to study. Now let's look at the three cases: Gerontocracy (exponentially more power with age and study) The oldest mages, when not lost to the world in some incredibly abstruse quest in the higher dimensions, are so powerful as to tear a younger mage to pieces with nary but a bat of their eyelashes. One does NOT anger an old mage. Some of the grumpier have been known to set villages aflame for poor service in a bar. Especially among the eldest senile ones, the older and younger apprentices alike tread with care, and even their strangest whims are fulfilled in full. There is little of politics, since no one outside one's (tiny) age cohort is anywhere near in power. There is a rigid age-bound hierarchy of power, and any deviations are met with severe rebuke and even binding (preventing the mage from studying). Hierarchies mean most will know exactly their place, and complex ceremonies are there to facilitate and ease interactions, and diminish the room for errors and miscommunication. The rare wars of the Elders (the latest is slanderously rumored to have started over a mistake in a tea ceremony) can devastate entire lands, leaving them dead and barren for generations. Aristocracy (power is in the blood) Power is in the blood, and only unlocked by study. Mages are painfully aware of this, and guard their bloodlines jealously. Genetics has been worked out talomere to talomere. In the Great Game, marriages are planned generations in advance, assassinations and byzantine schemes are rife, and you have a near-feudal system with the powerful families of Magisters at the top, Maiors in the middle, and the barely magical Compulsors tasked with keeping order among the plebs. Under the Lex Sanguinis, genetic modification is forbidden under penalty of death, and Questors are tasked to seek out and destroy all who trespass. For the powerful, however, the law is respected more in its universal breach, and all the great houses who do not wish to fall behind secretly engage in extensive genetic manipulation. After generations, their offspring are so monstrous as to barely be recognizably human. Althing (power is rather evenly distributed after serious study) Since the power of any one mage is no match for the combined power of the Althinghouse, the Commonwealth of Magi, a majority rule system is in place, where politically skilled mages strive for power and influence, while most mages simply don't care enough to be bothered, and would rather transmute earthworms all day than attend a general meeting. For this reason, full meetings are rarely held, and an informal council (the Guyde) handles day to day business, but remains subject to the will of the full Althing if such is called. A force of Lawreglans acts as police, subduing unruly mages and those overly abusive towards the Commoners. TL;DR version: In a world with magic, who would rule? MAGES. Wouldn't they be shy, or recluse? NOPE, out of fear of, you guessed it, other MAGES. Gotta fight fireballs with fireballs, man. 

(I'm going to generalize to "projectile" here, since what you're asking for seems to be a missile-type device in a bullet form-factor.) There are two big problems you need to solve: First is tech - a guided projectile needs a lot of tech to work. First off you either need some sort of sensor suite to "see" the target (and thus know what to do to hit it), or a comm suite (so the gun or other external observer can tell the bullet where to go). Plus, you'll need some sort of computing platform, and most importantly, a thrust system to change the direction. Oh, and all of this needs to be able to compensate for a rifled bullet spinning at an absurd rate (Google tells me that an M4 carbine's bullets spin at a couple hundred thousand RPM), and any changes to direction will need to happen very fast (since bullets travel at hundreds or thousands of feet per second). To be clear, I am absolutely hand-waving the entire "how do you tell a spinning bullet to move 'left'" problem into super-science land. The second problem is that you need to fit all of this into the projectile itself, and that means you're making a heavier bullet or a more fragile one. A 50cal bullet is only about six-inches long, and there's no empty space in there. Something is going to need to be sacrificed. But amusingly, there is something closer to what you're thinking of - gyrojets. Played with in the 60s, they're essentially really small missiles that are fired from guns. You shoot from a gun, but they fly like a missile (little fins and all). While they were impractical back then due to technology, new improvements in radio control could be what you're looking for, if you're more interested in "guns that don't miss" over "bullets that don't miss". 

I have my own naming process (I have good-, bad- and grey- guy root vowels and consonants, and build from there), but I would love to know more about how other worldbuilders go about naming their characters. 

The take home point seems to be that larger stars tend to process or blow away their disks relatively quickly. The actual N-body dynamics you describe (two stars and a granular disk) are far too complex to be easily treated here, but this is the closest I could find. 

Probably the biggest result would have been that America would have been "discovered" by the Portuguese. Because of the physical layout of the Atlantic, their sailors learnt to use something they called volta do mar, or turn to the sea. 

I'm sure someone has tried, but they would run into multiple problems in short order. 1) How do you prove he's making them? They're exact duplicates, after all. Even if you trace serial numbers, you'll find that they're in your system as authentic. 2) Where do you serve him? He's not a resident of your country, and if there's a government at the North Pole, they don't have treaties with anyone (and if there's a boss, it's probably the Big Man himself) 3) Better yet, how do you serve him? Not like anyone's gonna catch him during his yearly trip (heaven knows NORAD has been after him for years with no success), and your GPS ain't gonna get you to the Workshop. 4) I suppose you could try him in absentia, but what country wants to admit that a foreign national does millions of home invasions every year and the government is powerless to stop it? 

First of all, simultaneity is an ill-defined concept in the modern understanding of the universe, so realistically, the question can be answered with a simple no. Second of all, I'll assume we're talking different (and arbitrarily distant) galaxies in the same universe. When you bring in multiple universes, there's no good reason to assume the time dimension's arrow would be parallel and pointing in the same direction, so comparing times across universes wouldn't make much sense either (imagine one universe's time arrow as perpendicular to the other --- this actually happens inside event horizons of black holes.) But let's try to avoid answering no, because that's boring, right? Let's imagine some partial workarounds. On earth in the distant past, sailors would determine their position with reference to the stars. In the universe, you can use the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background to know how long it's been since the Big Bang, since it will decrease as time passes and the universe expands. With sufficiently accurate measurement, you can get arbitrarily precise results (down to a certain limit). Under a Newtonian framework, that would be a universal clock. However, in the real world, two observers using the CMB clock will assign perfectly reasonable times to a distant event (say observer A 'waving' from his galaxy to observer B on Earth), with the slight snafu that the times won't actually match.
