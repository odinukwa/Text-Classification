Fire Your Lizards could live/have settled in an area of naturally occurring methane seeps. There could be a large deposit that is slowly seeping out nad had been lit on fire like Darvaza Crater. Also, Artic Climates are known to contribute to atmospheric methane so these seeps may be tapped as well. Also equally viable is an area with volcanic activity like Iceland, plenty of hot vents and hydrothermal springs. 

What you described would more or less occur, provided the light from the sun can be blocked out, the planets would appear to line up. Over the course of the year(s) they would appear to move back and fourth. However, the planets would be much less visible, if at all, at their closest approaches to the observer because the sunlight would not be reflecting off of them. 

Your people would have adaptations similar to the Sherpa who live at high altitude in Nepal. There are numerous studies of their adaptations, here is a review of the studies and their findings. Some highlights are increased blood flow, more oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood, stronger hearts, and larger chests. A more complete summary is below: 

You aren't as safe as you think Other properties of the ship The combustion chamber need not be made of any sort of imagined material. Conditions in today's rocket nozzles readily exceed the material properties of the nozzle, so measures are taken to protect them. Cooling is the biggest, some use the cryogenic fuels through the nozzles as a preheat, others use a stream of fuel to form a layer between the combustion and the nozzle. The same could be done with the nuclear fire of a torch ship. The plasma in a test fusion reactor is contained in powerful magnetic fields and kept away from the walls of the container. The same could be done with the torch ship, stand off the reaction from the walls of the chamber, add some radiation shielding and a cooling system and you are all set. Beam Weapons (To include directed energy) A beam of charged particles could easily wreak havoc on the nuclear reaction, admittedly it would be challenging to ram through the exhaust stream, but focused enough and it could get through. Adding alpha partilces to a fusion reaction could snuff it out or cause a runaway reaction. Beta Particles could cause issues as well by changing the charge of the plasma. The effectiveness of this depends on the magnitude of the magnetic containment and its polarization. A beam of neutrons could also cause issues, interfering with the reaction and adding a ton of extra energy to the chamber as they decay. Heavier Ions will also interfere with the reaction and do physical damage to the containment chamber. Pick your wavlength of the laser, and dump plenty of power into it. Depending on the content of the reaction some wavelengths may pass right through it and damage the walls of containment. I'm thinking gamma radion of a magnitude that exceeds the design of the torch ship. Likewise, some wavelengths may be absorbed by the reaction and exceed the design of the ship, I'd guess microwaves. Results may vary, ask your lead engineer if you have questions Kenetic Weapons Relevant XKCD Comic. Moving fast enough and your kinetic projectile will be unaffected by the nuclear fire. If the contact with the heat is brief then the projectile won't have time to vaporize/ablate away. I'll see if I can apply some thermodynamics to it later on. Also, even if you manage to vaporize it, now you've got a cloud of vapor with the energy of the projectile moving towards you. Explosives Getting them into the chamber is the main issue. Get through the exhaust stream and your payload will do its job. 

What if the race that destroyed the planet was into some crazy science stuff. They found a way to tune the gravitational attractiveness of matter. Whole mountains could have been made neutrally buoyant by flipping half of the matter to gravity repelling material. Or simpler yet set to gravity neutral. That'd be some weird stuff. It'd still have mass so it would be hard to move around but it wouldn't fall to the surface if it broke off. It'd kind of drift away behaving as if it was in zero gravity. 

Magical creatures must to follow their nature. The thing that separates Mankind from from all other creatures magical or not is that we have control over our natures. We have choice. This is our glory and our tragedy. It is glorious because we can be anything we want. It is tragic because we do not have anything we ARE. A deer cannot be other than a deer. A scorpion cannot be other than a scorpion. It is only mankind that can choose what to be or not to be. A magical creature could be your friend for decades and then betray you not because they want to, but because circumstances have conspired to turn their nature against you. Contrive to make the circumstances dire enough and the resulting backlash by mankind would so brutal terrible that god himself would weep and have no choice but to intervene and separate the warring creatures before one side exterminated the other. 

She was a religious person and pretty dedicated to her beliefs which included a rejection of most modern medicine, but if you came to her and said: 

If we have no ability to choose the wrong path (or if the wrong path is not appealing) there is no glory in the choice of the right path. Or put another way if the only available option is the right one, we are simply vapid automatons acting out an insipid morality play. The greater the power of evil, the greater the deception, the more opportunity for the righteous to attain glory in following the right path. 

Send your torpedos through sub space. They go "underneath" so they're torpedos. Missiles travel through normal space. Different tactics and countermeasures apply to the distinct types of weapons. 

So lets work on the Cost of launch. My favorite quote from one of the scrappy new rocketry pioneers was: 

This weapon would have interesting ramifications. Open spaces become dangerous. You'd hide in dust and gasses. You'd get matter between you and any potential threat pretty quickly. If you could get matter within close proximity to the attacker, the antimatter weapon turns back on itself. Dust, gas, charged particles. Maybe send out a bunch of drones, small and difficult to detect. These drones are able to emit strong magnetic fields (energy is cheap and portable because antimatter) They then feed small and amounts of charged particles into the fields. The charged particles travel at very high speed and can be redirected quickly by shifting the field. Alone these fields are completely harmless, but in the presence of antimatter they become something else entirely. Your enemy charges up his anti-matter beam, your drone flicks on and starts spinning matter around right near his ship. The antimatter beam licks out, immediately interacts with tiny amounts of matter and destroys itself and the ship and anything nearby. Of course if you can get a drone close without being detected you might as well deliver a tiny antimatter bomb with it instead. But as a non-offensive deterrent it might work. 

Tiny Robots Instead of relatively high-velocity weapons or directed energy weapons, launch small robotic payloads that once they hit their target can seek out a vulnerability in the armor and exploit it. The tiny robots can carry whatever payload you like to defeat armor: tiny shaped charge, drills and acid, electrical shock, work together to dismantle armor/target. Such machines could even change direction in mid-air (space) and determine friend from foe. This concept appears in the book Seveneves by Neil Stephenson as a method of warfare that won't hurt the hulls of spacecraft. 

Giant Impact What if the gas giant suffered an impact that discolored the cloud tops? Look at what happened with Comet Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9 broke up and struck Jupiter over a several day period. 

Not for a very long time Energy is not a good form of currency because it is everywhere and it is very easy to get more. Aluminum used to be more valuable than gold, now it's used as foil and thrown out by the ton. Its abundance has made it nearly worthless (compared to gold). In order for energy to have significant value, it would need to be very scarce, especially since a kilocalorie is not much energy at all. Energy may be a currency if a society survives until the Heat Death of the universe. In the far far far future energy in the universe will become very scarce. The expanding universe will rob the universe of energy and what remains will be spread so far and thin as to be essentially nonexistent. In this time there will be no stars that shine, nor radioactive elements to derive energy from. The only source of energy will come from the Hawking Radiation from supermassive black holes. Their energy will be the most valuable thing left in the cold dark universe because without it nothing could occur and thuse its value preiceless. 

Climate Depends on several things, if we are sticking with the Earth-Sun system then the Earth will get much hotter since it will receive more the solar energy than it gets now. Probably pretty bad for the majority of life on earth but Antarctica could be a nice place to live at least. Now, this is assuming nothing is done to alter the Earth. If we are talking moving planets then altering the atmosphere is easy. Removing the greenhouse gasses is one step that could preserve the earth because without them the earth would be very cold. With a faster rotation expect winds to be very different, again hard to say directly but expect them to be moving faster. The Coriolis Effect will play a much larger part in the weather than it does here on earth. A combination of more winds and higher temp extremes probably will cause superstorms. Probably still habitable, just much hotter. For example the solar system inner limit may be as low as .5 AU. 

With a question like this there are two ways to go: how would things play out in a work of fiction, and how would they play out in real life? I think a lot of people have covered the "work of fiction" angle. If you were going to design a city from scratch and with none of the real-world financial or political constraints that cities face as they grow and evolve, you'd probably have a big network of underground shelters for people to hide in when the dragons came around. But let's look at a similar real-life situation featuring unpredictable death from above: a city prone to catastrophic tornado damage. (I write this with my other browser tab open to a weather radar, because I'm currently under threat from a severe storm system right now). 

On top of that, any castle seriously intended as a fortress would feature machicolations, which are great if you want to drop rocks on the invaders scaling the side of your tower but which are probably less useful when you're facing an indiscriminate airborn flamethrower. So the parts of the castles which have been designed to be the most secure are in reality probably the least so. Moreover, these fortifications would have been constructed with the express purpose of preventing large underground structures from being built underneath them. This is due to the ancient combat tactic known as "mining," where an invading army would dig small tunnels under a building and use them to place explosives underneath the walls, hopefully breaching them. In fact, the moats that surrounding some castles were more to prevent mining than to keep out invaders on foot. The one thing a castle would have underground would be its cellars, which were designed specifically to be a bit fire-resistant. (These were still a serious weakness a couple of reasons. Remember how Guy Fawkes was going to blow up the House of Lords by setting off an explosion in its cellar? And then there's the fact that, without modern construction techniques, every extra floor you add is just another thing trying to make the castle sink into the ground.) These underground storage rooms are where, in the event of a dragon attack, you'd have the best shot at surviving. 

Okay, so how do we compare this to what we know about the (I'm assuming) medieval societies that we're imagining facing a dragon attack? We know that many medieval cities were built around castles that served as a central fortress for the community. The laborers who worked in the city surrounding the castle would, in the event of an invasion, come inside of the castle. Now I'm going to assume that the castle predates the dragon here, because nobody in his right mind would spend the time, money, resources, and man-hours it takes to put up a castle in an area where there were constant dragon attacks.
