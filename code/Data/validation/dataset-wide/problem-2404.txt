So far as I have read, one requests ordination and the rules are recited. This might be described (in English) as "taking monastic vows", and a vow (to obey the rules) might be implicit in the ordination, but I don't see such a "vow" being spoken explicitly. 

I think that when you know you're dying, for example, or when you know your partner is dying, you may become better: more generous, for example, better at making peace perhaps. So although "never thinking it would end" does sound romantic, sometimes it can be more unwise than it is admirable. 

It's hard to prove a negative but in this article, Getting the Message, Thanissaro Bhikkhu emphasizes "no killing": 

An example of one word in English which has many specific meanings is, just to give an example, "run": you can run a race, run a horse, run an engine, run a bath, run a business, let things run their course, run away, run the printing presses, run for President, etc. as described in a dictionary. 

And to try to begin to answer "Why is it called Buddhism?" there's Lineage and Dharma transmission . I think that in theory or traditionally that's understood as an unbroken chain of transmission of Dharma from teacher to student, a chain going back to the earliest teachers and the Buddha himself. The historical reality might be more complicated than that. Even so I think there's an emphasis on studying with (learning from) a living and relatively enlightened teacher, perhaps instead of an emphasis (or an exclusive emphasis) on studying the earliest texts (e.g. the Pali suttas or the Chinese Agamas). As well as suttas there's also the Vinaya which (I read) is apparently followed within some schools of Zen and not others. 

As for dealing with "anger", the doctrine about three poisons suggest that anger is related to aversion ("I don't want that") which is again related to a type craving ("I want that not to be"); so anger too can be handled by non-craving ... or by advesa and metta. If I sometimes (hopefully briefly) feel angry there's a verse I like to remember from the Dhammapada, 

The last sentence of the question is, "On the grounds that nirvana is all that the Tathagata is". I'm not sure it's right to identify the Tathagata with nirvana i.e. to say that the Tathagata is nirvana, nor than nirvana is the Tathagata. Nirvana is commonly described by what it isn't, especially "not born", i.e. it's unconditioned (also "deathless" and so on), or perhaps more positively as liberation or as the end of stress. There are suttas and essays about what nirvana is (e.g. here and here and here) 

How self-consistent are those descriptions anyways? I guess you're asking whether the several descriptions of cosmology are consistent with each other. I think we're supposed to read them as (or read in them) a description of Dharma: and consider their consistency with the Dharma. According to the Four Great References people should study them: 

It's sometimes said, in a context in which you might expect to hear Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu! Given that understanding Dhamma is the highest good, you might appreciate someone's virtue or good fortune, when they show evidence of that or share that. It may be used in a more general situation: 

Unrul3r's answer includes that it might mean going or coming (gata or agata). Andrei's answer is that it means 'grounded' or 'rooted' (which makes sense to me: because if you go or come, have gone or have come, to somewhere then that is where you are). Combined (and further to user319's answer) these remind me of a Zen story -- using Google I cannot find a reference to it at the moment, so I paraphrase it: 

So, "failure to communicate" doesn't count as lying ... unless your aim is to misrepresent the truth. People in this discussion, at least, decided that the "precept" is about (specifically) lying, rather than (more generally) about right speech. In right speech, abusive speech is subjective: some consider certain words abusive, so if you speak to them in such a manner it won't be right speech. I suppose I try to use mild words always, use a neutral or formal "register", even though some people, friends, swear or tease each other for fun. I'm not saying that my doing so is "skillful", but I don't intend it to be offensive. Others might not, and then there should be no violation of right speech in that situation even though everything you do is the same. Well, here are some definitions of Right Speech. A lot of that is, hopefully, easy to understand. Some of it is difficult, e.g., "the Tathagata ... has a sense of the proper time for saying them" -- I suppose that's a matter of wisdom and knowledge. Occasionally it may be wrong not to speak (c.f. Ananda in AN 5.166). Personally, I feel as if though I went from the first level you describe into confusion. To avoid taking what's not given, if you want something, you can buy it, or be given it as a gift, or it's free (like air) ... otherwise not. Perhaps you can apply it to personal relationships too: people can't be given, aren't property, don't try to "take" them. Maybe consider what "right employment" means for a layperson, how to use wealth properly, and give to who needs a gift. To avoid lying: I don't know, if you're tempted to lie then maybe think about why that temptation comes about, what gives rise to it? I've long thought that an ideal is that a person should see no need to lie. 

I think that's saying that when you converse with someone who is angry, then you yourself will feel some anger. I'm not sure why that's so, whether it's a selfish reaction ("how dare he?!") or a sympathetic reaction. In summary: 

I'm not saying that Piya Tan is a secular Buddhist but I wondered what he had written about these phrases. 

Perhaps further to Tenzin's saying that the mind-and-body is not "I", if you only ask, "Why does the body get tired?" then IMO an answer might be explained using (not Buddhism itself but using) physiology, biochemistry, maybe even thermodynamics. It does reminds me of the Buddha's saying, though, "all compound things are subject to decay". A slightly different question (maybe a question we should ask, instead) could be whether you're mindful, or what you're mindful of -- and, whether you find "it gets tired" dissatisfactory. Because maybe what's important to keep in mind is "dukkha" and "cessation of dukkha". 

Maybe that it's it: if MN 11 was mistaken for DN 11; but it's not an exact match. Even so I think that may be the Pali phrase you're looking for -- 

"May you be well" might be a near equivalent (see also "Metta meditation" for further details). It's easy to find more elaborate versions of that phrase, for example, 

According to Wikipedia, Indonesia has an official state policy policy/philosphy called Pancasila i.e. "Five Precepts" (which are not the same as the "Five (lay) precepts" of Buddhism). 

If Buddha didn't believe in soul why did he believe in Re-incarnation, after life etc which could be because of soul? So apparently he didn't believe in soul because he saw things (everything) as impermanent. There are various reasons for believing in rebirth: but one of them might be not seeing death as permanent. Someone once wrote, "Buddhists don't believe in death". Actually the same person wrote that Buddhists (at least, Theravada Buddhists ... Tibetan Buddhism explains things differently) don't believe in reincarnation, they believe in rebirth. And really it's more just a believe in "birth" (as a cause of suffering and existence), rather than rebirth. Another reason, I think, was because it's important to teach that actions and intentions have moral (as well as material) consequences. Also, by the way, there's the matter of other people and of altruism. Assuming that actions are inconsequential would be wrong, according to AN 10.176: 

Related to non-attachment is the Buddhist term Nekkamma (renunciation). The original version of the question included the monk tag, and indeed it's maybe "renunciation" for which Buddhist monks are famous. Suttas in the Pali canon recommend renunciation. I think that Buddhist lay people don't (and probably cannot) practice renunciation in quite the same way as Buddhist monks. I note without comment that Nekkhamma is listed among the 10 perfections of Theravāda Buddhism, but isn't in the (shorter) list of 6 perfections of Mahāyāna Buddhism. 

I suspect that when and if you have learned some Buddhist view, then you can read e.g. the passage which you quoted from the Tao Te Ching and interpret that from a Buddhist perspective. For example, it seems to me to be talking about non-self and/or the impermanence of conditioned/compound objects. Whether it is talking about that, instead of just seeming to be talking about that, is another matter. The "epiphany" in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is that the Tao corresponds to the author's conception of Quality (which I think is a.k.a. Virtue). Perhaps that implies that the Tao Te Ching can map to (been seen as a description of) almost any transcendental insight. That doesn't IMO imply that every transcendental insight is alike, nor that the Tao Te Ching is especially good (skillful, accurate) at teaching such insight. 

There's an article in English titled Anicca Vata Sankhara in which Bhikkhu Bodhi describes the various meanings of the word. Here are very brief extracts from that article, a summary: 

(not too surprising when monks dwell in a 'forest' instead of as 'householders'). It's also used in contexts which suggest it means delight and pleasure: 

And maybe your attachment to the old place is a bit of an attachment. I remember (and sometimes "miss") many places where I used to live. Sometimes I'm reminded of the end of chapter 80 of the Tao Te Ching, instead of thirsting for other places, to be somewhere else. 

I always meditate with eyes closed. I am a very visual thinker so it's just natural for me to see lots of things happening in my mind. I seem to have a place in my mind from which images stream or bubble, like water from a spring or like the bubbles from an air pump in an aquarium. If I concentrate (focus) on that then it forms into an image, or a dream-fragment. A way to semi-hide that is to open my eyes: the light seems to hide or wash out or fade the inner image. Some traditions recommend that you meditate with your eyes open, for example Wall Gazing in Soto Zen, 

There are several topics about faith on this site. I think that "faith" may be a preliminary state e.g. as described in this topic. If you were drowning and someone throws you a rope, you need enough faith (or confidence, belief, understanding, lack of doubt) in the saviour and solution to take and use the rope. The metaphor is applicable whether you're drowning in water, drowning in sensuality, drowning in despair, or etc. There may be parts of the dharma (for example you mention the doctrines of rebirth, or of psychic powers) that are useless to you: you don't know how, you're unable to make use of them. Suminda's answer says, "You do not have to believe but do not reject"; and Thiago's, "actually agnostic about rebirth or put this subject aside". I guess my answer is that the parts which you are unable to use are simply irrelevant: they don't come up; they don't form part of the solution which is available to you. 

The second difference is, what is it that is being caused or conditioned? When people talk about "dependent origination" based on the Pali canon, I think they're often talking about the 12 Nidanas (the topics of which include Ignorance as a condition of Birth of Death), or maybe the 4 Noble Truths (including craving as a condition of, or origin of, suffering, ad the origin of cessation of suffering). Conversely I suspect that in a biography of Milarepa, it might be that the term is used to describe the causes or cultivation of boddhicitta. If that's so then perhaps the "cause" that's mentioned is closer in meaning to the Pali word Bhavana.
