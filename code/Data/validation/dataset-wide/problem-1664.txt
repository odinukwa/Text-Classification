Now, the results could be different if you're just looking at California, but xiaohouzi79's data suggest otherwise. Another factor is that there are a couple of other types of skin cancer - such as basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell cancer - but those are much less fatal than melanomas. Basically, it looks as though Lieu's statement was incorrect. 

Normal viruses infect cells in order to take advantage of cellular mechanisms to reproduce themselves. A class of viruses known as "retroviruses" have a slightly peculiar mechanism to achieve this - they synthesise a special enzyme called "reverse transcriptase", which translates their own RNA into DNA which is incorporated into the host cell's genome. The host cell then replicates the virus' DNA alongside the rest of its own. Should a retrovirus happen to infect a germ line cell - i.e., a sperm or an ovum - the retroviral DNA will be copied into the offspring's DNA. And their offspring. That's called an "endogenous retrovirus". Some cause or contribute to cancers - and sometimes (for example) that DNA even gets co-opted for a useful purpose. Given thousands or millions of generations, these endogenous infections accumulate. It doesn't even have to be independent infections - when a cell is infected it produces new copies of the RNA virus which can insert itself again somewhere else in the germline genome - even across the generations. They eventually tend to get deactivated by one mutation or another, but phylogenetic studies have shown that the some 98,000 retroviral elements and fragments in the human genome come from relatively few infections. Estimates vary - many of the retroviral sequences have been modified by mutation over the aeons, making it hard to find them all - but recent estimates do come to about 8% of the human genome having a retroviral origin. There's a fair chunk of virus in all of us. 

This list does, indeed, include every Republican president since Coolidge (excluding GW Bush, who was elected after the thesis was written). However, that list is members and guests, not just members. 

There was, particularly amongst veterans who had been captured and imprisoned in harsh POW camps, a great deal of animosity which lasted decades after the war. An 1949 article in the former Melbourne newspaper The Argus quotes an RSL spokesman saying: 

However, according to the Fundraising Plan, Koch gave $25000 in 2011, with $200,000 projected in 2012. The funding to Dr Wojick is also listed in the Fundraising Plan. 

Teske was indeed, one of the nine lead authors listed chapter 10 of the report. This chapter cites two articles by Teske, one peer reviewed and one not. However, the scenario mentioned in the IPCC's press release is attributed to the peer-reviewed paper, not the non-peer reviewed one: McKitrick's description here is inaccurate. 

Most other sources do not claim Coolidge as a member, and I can't confirm George W. Bush's membership (though it's certainly plausible). It does seem fairly reasonable to believe that all Republican presidents between those two were members, however. 

One little inconstancy: elsewhere on that same site it specifies that it's every Republican president since Coolidge (1923-1929 has been a member. I'd normally include 1923-1929 in "since 1923". I can't find any basis for claiming Coolidge as a member. A small matter. The best source of information I could find on the Bohemian Club was Peter Phillip's doctoral dissertation "A Relative Advantage: Sociology of the San Francisco Bohemian Club". According to that: 

The Council on Environmental Quality also controlled which administration scientists would be able to speak to the media, and edited the statements they made: 

A 1995 study found that adding mental practise into firearm training for police recruits was effective: 

There is also another hitch. It's not yet clear that aerosol nucleation is a limiting factor for the formation of CCNs. Snow-Kropla et. al. (2011) found that the difference in concentration of CCNs between the solar minimum and maximum (which are the high and low points for cosmic rays, respectively) was less than 0.2%. The Kirkby et. al. paper does provide part of the evidence you'd need for establishing a link between cosmic rays and global temperatures, but you'd also need evidence of a stronger link between nucleation and cloud condensation nuclei. So I'd definitely say it is relevant to climate research - but it's relevance is currently in the technical literature. Meanwhile, without a negative change in the rate of cosmic rays being received, they cannot be responsible for the observed change in temperatures. 

(another variation of this story adds the claim that he's a world-class powerlifter) Peculiarly for a world-class powerlifter or a researcher, there seems to be no mention of a Dr Blaslotto on Google except in this story. There are no results for Judd Blaslotto or Dr. Blaslotto on Google Scholar. It does appear that Dr Blaslotto and his study are about as real as the hoops that his second group dunked. On the other hand, the University of Chicago's librarians do point out another study, from 1960, which does exist, with similar results: 

According to Statistics Netherlands a total of 136,058 people died in the Netherlands in 2010. 3136 of those were euthanasia - that's about 2.3%. A study found that in 2005, euthanasia accounted for 1.7% of all deaths in the Netherlands (also notable from their numbers, I think, are a decrease in the frequency of "withholding or withdrawing of life-prolonging treatment" from 20.2% before legislation passed to 15.6% in 2005). That study found that "Ending of life without explicit request by the patient" accounted for 0.4% of deaths, and that in 85.5% of these cases, it was estimated to shorten life by less than one week. This was less than before the legislation allowing euthanasia passed - though not by a statistically significant amount. 

Heartland has issued a press release confirming that a number of documents had been emailed to a third party. They claim that one of them (the 2012 Climate Strategy [PDF]) is faked (though obviously they're very involved in the topic). Several companies which are listed as donors in the documents - specifically, Microsoft, General Motors, GlaxoSmithKline and Diageo - have confirmed that they gave money to Heartland for non-climate related activities. According to the Fundraising Plan [PDF]: 

One of the premises of a new film, "Anonymous", due to come out in a couple of weeks, is that Shakespeare's plays were authored by Edward de Vere, instead of by Shakespeare. The producers have also created educational materials arguing that Shakespeare was a fraud. The notion that de Vere was the author has been around a while, having first been proposed in 1920 by a schoolmaster named J. Thomas Looney. But what's the evidence? Is there a consensus among historians who've looked into the topic? Were Shakespeare's plays written by Shakespeare, de Vere, or someone else? 

The University of Chicago's librarians, when the topic came up, could find no trace of a "Dr Blaslotto". 

It is highly unlikely that the medieval warm period was, globally, warmer than current. The IPCC 4th Assessment Report graphed a dozen different replications of the "hockey stick" graph, along with the instrumental record. This is for the Northern Hemisphere, which has both the best paleoclimate record and that's also where the various forms of historical evidence (such as the agricultural evidence and Viking settlements) are located. We can see from this that there are a few short patches in the 10th and 12th century which may possibly be warmer than today - it's just not very likely that they are. While most reconstructions do include a MWP that was slightly warmer than the temperatures around that period, it was probably not higher than the present-day average. In addition, according to Mann et. al. (2008):
