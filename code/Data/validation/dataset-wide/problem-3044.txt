Second, the relegation of cavalry to a supporting role as light dragoons (ie mounted skirmishers and scouts), and the abandonment of it's role as a shock troop, completes the slow decline in cavalry's effectiveness that began with the arrival of the pike and then the bayonet. Not since before the introduction of the stirrup had the role of cavalry been so diminished. This innovation stands out particularly because it was disdained to a large extent in Europe, which continued to witness attempts to employ cavalry as shock troops right into the early stages of World War 1, and even saw the wide-scale conversion of dragoon regiments into lancers and hussars through the second half of the 19th century. While useful in a Colonial role, cavalry as a shock troop was by the 1860's no longer effective on the modern battlefield. The third significant innovation I see in the ACW is mass conscription; the beginning of the modern nation in arms. The entire case for a successful Confederate secession was based on the premise that it's elite professional army - better led top to bottom, better trained, and more fit - would overcome the Northern urban rabble. Although Confederate casualties were much less than Northern in virtually every battle of the War, the sheer scale of Northern industrial output and manpower overwhelmed the Confederacy. Update: The only major war between 1815 and 1860 is the Crimean, where none of these innovations is seen. The armies of the Texan War were barely brigade-sized units by European standards. Point 1 is a direct consequence of the breech-loading rifle and Gatling gun, which were not available for Crimea. Charge of the Light Brigade and the uiversal conversion of dragoons to Lancers until 1914 disproves point 2 being taken in Crimea. Point 3 was perfected by the Union and Prussia about the same time, 1860-1870, with dramatically positive effects for both. 

If you type the first five words of the speech into a search engine, the answer is easy to find. Commencement address 1963 

Literacy rates in the 15h century were on the order of 10%, and that would have been concentrated in professions (clergy, law, government) - so let's halve that for the village population. I wish I could dig into the numbers to distinguish between literacy and functional literacy. the 10th largest town in England had approximately 5000 people - we can assume that the average village had less than 50% of that number. A second source lists 50-300 as a more reasonable number. Although I suspect the distribution was a power curve rather than a bell curve, let's be generous and assume that there are 175 people in the average village. So there are less than 17 literate people in this village, and probably less than 9. Again, given the incredible cost of learning to read (hours of non-productive labor), they are probably related to one another and already share a household. Prior to the invention of a printing press books were fantastically expensive. This source refers to print runs of less than 20 books - so there are very few books in the world. This source suggests that all of Germany printed less than 100 books/year. - and most of those are Bibles. So what is the point of a library? Of the 17 people in the village who can use the book for more than fire kindling, they all know each other and can share books. Most of them own the same book - a Bible. Books are an incredibly expensive luxury- elsewhere I've seen records of monastic libraries that were admired for their extensive collection of less than a dozen books. (The annual book production of a major country). The notion of a medieval village library is absurd. 

The Oxford English Dictionary attests the use of cock-tail as a mixed drink from 1809 in W. Irving's Knickerbockers: 

Simply; no. In war one must do a multitude of things well to win: logistics, command, morale, training, and battle tactics just for a start. Getting any one of these things seriously wrong is sufficient to ensure likely defeat. That Alexander was able to string together victory after victory virtually guarantees that he was performing all of these skills well. To claim that any one of them was sufficient, of itself, for his string of victories is naive in the extreme. 

Comparing just to the Constitution of the Netherlands, that of Belgium was for a Unitary State with no substantial body of Common Law and tradition, while that of The Netherlands was for a Federal State, with a substantial body of Common Law and Tradition. Further part of the motive for the separation of Belgium from Netherlands in 1831 had been a feeling that insufficient Freedom of Religion was provided for in the Dutch Constitution. Further, the 1849 decision by Denmark to base its constitution on those of Belgium and Norway reinforced the notion that it was a model constitution well suited for adaption elsewhere. Of course, there is no written Constitution for either England proper or the United Kingdom, so using it as a basis for a written constitution is substantially more work. The United States has a written Constitution, but is both a Federal State and a Republic rather than a constitutional monarchy. The Empire of Germany was again a Federal State rather than a Unitary State; but was not yet a fully developed Constitutional Monarchy; the Kaiser still retained considerable powers that were presumably deemed undesirable in the 1906 Iranian Constitution. In summary, all constitutions are different, meeting varying goals and objectives of the constitutional congress. It's less about which one is best, in an absolute sense, and more about which one is best for us. So, inferring from the choice made, the Constitutional Revolutionaries of 1906 desired a Monarchical Unitary State, with minimal reliance on Common Law and Tradition, minimal jurisdiction of a Constitutional Court, strictly limited Royal powers and authorities, and substantive Freedom of Religion for the Sunni, Kurdish, and Zoroastrian minorities. 

tl;dr - if you read nothing else, listen to Mike Duncan's revolutions.; won't directly answer your question, but it will address many of the false premises underlying the question. Difficult to get much traction on this question because it is based on several false premises. First, medieval man did not consider money to be wealth - read Ricardo. According to Ricardo, wealth is land, labor and capital; in the medieval era, 90% of wealth was land and labor - and the two were effectively inseparable. The difference between the feudal economy and the capitalist economy is largely around this distinction - that in the feudal economy, capital's effects are severely limited by the availability of land and labor, which land and labor are not effectively limited by a lack of capital. Second, the portion of racism directed against Jews due to their wealth was first and foremost simple fear of the other. Underlying that hatred was the fact that Christians and Moslems were forbidden to practice usury. Usury was ill understood. Simply put, they were simple people and they refused to accept that if you borrow money, you have to pay back the loan. (I know people like this today; there is probably nothing more consistent in the human character than the notion that "inconvenient for me" is inextricably tied to "Evil". These two points reinforce one another - if borrowing money is evil, then saving money is foolish. In the absence of investments and capital markets, there is very little reason to save money and many reasons to avoid saving money. In a pre-capitalist economy, all money should be spent as soon as possible on a socially valuable outcome. What is a socially valuable outcome? Today it is fashionable for hipsters to denigrate our modern materialist culture - there are any number of quips about the evils of money and banks and wall street. More than half of those people survived to the age where they can spew that idiotic bile because of the consequence of capital market. Think about the people you know, then adjust that circle on the assumption that 90% of pregnancies will not come to term, and 50% of the women who lie down to give birth die in the effort. (so if a woman has four children, her chance of surviving in the medieval era is 0.5*05.*05.*05; she is 94% likely to be dead. I don't recall the number of children who survive, but from memory it is something like 50% die before they are 1 and another 50% before they hit puberty. But the birth control pills, modern obstetrics and health care that result in all those people surviving long enough to complain about materialism is ignored. One more example - up until WWI, it was pretty certain that the world would starve to death; then someone invented fertilizer. in 1890, 90% of American labor was devoted to farm labor; in 1910, 10% of labor was farm labor. (Drawing a blank on the source's name now - George Mason economist). People will argue my statistics, but nobody sane (modern Marxists are not sane, so I'm safe), will argue that any of these things would have been possible in a feudal economy; feudalism simply doesn't permit capital deepening. Finally, I think the premise that medieval man though about money is flawed. In the Medieval world, there were three classes: 

"pounds sterling" means exactly that - translated, 20 silver shillings, which was a silver coin slightly larger than a modern U.S. or Canadian dime I believe . From Wikipedia, pertaining to the 1816 "new" standard reminting of the shilling: "New silver coinage was to be of .925 (sterling) standard, with silver coins to be minted at 66 shillings to the pound. Hence, newly minted shillings weighed 87.273 grains or 5.655 grams.". Prior to 1816 the mintings were irregular. 

Here are four maps tracing the de facto control of the Low Countries through the first 30 years of the Eighty Years War: 

There are international agreements on the definition of POW dating back to the Lieber Code declared by Lincoln in 1862 

The only true defence or safeguard against any sort of authoritarianism is the vigilance of the citizenry: the refusal of the citizenry to either advocate, or submit to, arbitrary measures. Great Britain has no constitution, and the U.S.S.R. had a wonderful constitution - the non-existence of one and the existence of the other had absolutely no effect on the actual wielding of power, and the use or abuse of power by the state.. A people always gets the government it deserves - sooner rather than later. Update: A written constitution is simply the citizenry's (written) consensus on the process of governance; it possesses no inherent value beyond an unwritten consensus on the process of governance, except so far as a written record helps to avoid misunderstanding and clarify intent. As such, a constitution either written or unwritten has no inherent enforceability beyond the willingness of the citizenry to risk life, limb, and freedom to enforce it. 

I'm intrigued. How do we measure whether the pre-modern money supply was adequate. How do we collect the data to measure concepts like deflation? If we assume that an inadequate monetary supply causes a rise in barter, how do we measure the rise in barter? Is there a significant rise in the search for precious metals? A change in the rate of debasement? Can we detect the expected responses to deflation (deferred consumption of goods, changes in loan rates, etc.) 

I think @FelixGoldberg has the core of it; the source is not reliable or useful. Somewhere in one of Asimov's robot novels he has a comment about reasoning based on flawed sources & assumptions, and I think the wikipedia quote in question falls into that category. The best I could find is the following: Apparently Porcius Festus was the least offensive of a series of procurators. 

This presented Roman lawyers with a tricky question: was the shopkeeper liable for the injury? In a debate that echoes some of our own dilemmas about how far a property owner should go in defending himself against a burglar, they decided that, as the thief had been armed with a nasty piece of metal and had struck the first blow, he had to take responsibility for the loss of his eye. Note what is missing in this case - the shopkeeper never thought of summoning the police or taking legal action. He took direct, immediate action. Nor did the court consider that the thief was engaged in what we would today call a felony - they were only concerned with the loss of the eye. They had a very different notion of crime. (Bit of a paradox since they were (AFAIK) the first society to recognize the law as separate from the ruler. They displayed the law tablets, but never really used them.) Here is a somewhat simplistic summary of criminal deterrence in Rome The Law in Rome (Twelve Tables) - note that most of these crimes will be tried in civil court, not in criminal court (although the Roman's wouldn't have drawn the distinction, I think it is important for a modern understanding of Roman law. 

According to Wikipedia the first ever book printed in the Ottoman Empire was Arba'ah Turim in Hebrew. The date is believed to be 1493, though there are some claims for 1503 or 1504. The printers were David and Samuel ibn Nahmias of Istanbul. Note that the spread of printing technology through Europe was very rapid, and that by the time of this first printing in Istanbul, "the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe." In that sense at least, the Ottoman Empire had already fallen far behind the rest of Europe. Other early printing presses in the Ottoman Empire were in Saloniki, Greece, in 1515 and Vagharshapat, Armenia, in 1771. By 1496 there was an established printing press in Granada, but judging from the names of the printers (Meinrad Ungut, Hans Pegnitzer) this is wholly post-Reconquista. This was, of course, not part of the Ottoman Empire but a separate sovereign state until its conquest by Spain in 1492. 

In The Jury and the English Low of Homicide, 1200-1600, T. A. Green recaps both the specified period and its Anglo-Saxon & Norman precedents (pp 416-7): 

Those who are discontented will take up arms; the response of civil society is to set them right as to the facts, then pardon and pacify those whose contentment is newly restored. 

Appian's transcript of Mark Anthony's funeral oration, suggests that Shakespeare wrote for the stage, not for historical accuracy (although this is a record of what was said, not a transcript). 

Extractive - colonies had resources that could be shipped to the mother country at an attractive price. Consumptive - Colonies would purchase mother country goods at an attractive price. 

Arguably all societies are formed around institutions. Fukuyama claims, and it seems reasonable, that religious institutions were the most effective institutions between the "tribal" organization and modern secular societies. @Alex is right that it is difficult to judge how much a given institution relies on mystical or preternatural support. American is by treaty "not a Christian nation", but our money and our governmental rituals pay repeated service to a divine being. (please don't argue the point, merely note that the evidence isn't 100% consistent). On similar grounds, I'd argue that the "secular" status of the Communist party is arguable (the repeated assertions of the role of Communism in destiny, the "incorruptibility" of Lenin's body, the necessity of quoting the Mao and other prophets, etc. Although the official party line may be atheistic, the ritual practice of the members resembles religious behavior.) Outside the Western tradition, I concur with @Alex that Confucianism is a secular institution; I admit that I am not an expert on the field and that in my experience there is no consensus on the topic. I stipulate that "Religion" and "secular" are difficult to objectively define. Having said that I think that the French Revolution was the first group to make a positive attempt to exclude religions institutions from the legitimacy of their government. 

For six months only one of my Oma, Opa, and Aunt could leave the house at a time, so that if there was a knock on the door one person could answer it while the other raced up to the attic, to close the sliding panel on the cubby. One person besides my father had to remain awake at all times, in case of a midnight raid, to close the cubby. Of course my father had to sleep in the cubby as well. 

When "on the open sea" the only approaching danger is the weather, which approaches from the direction of the wind. However though modern racing dinghies (and larger vessels) can sail to within about 45 degrees of the wind, earlier vessels were more likely limited to about 55 or even 60 degrees of the wind at close-hauled. When broad-reaching or running the weather is approaching from the vessels rear. The helmsman has a clear view of approaching weather at all of these points of sail. For seeing out to a further horizon, a crewman posted to the crowsnest on the main mast was standard procedure except in the most vile weather conditions. When in close quarters, such as maneuvering in a restricted channel, a crewman would have been posted to the bow to perform depth sounding at a very low speed. Frequently also a local pilot would have been brought on board to assist with safe navigation, when such was available. Finally, note that: 

Obviously the best we can do is to make an educated guess, but I think the answer is the rules of engagement you cite: 

As Semaphore points out, the UK is paying interest on consolidated annuities. His links are better, but here is a story from the New York Times. (Note: Semaphore corrected my quibble about UK vs GB; he was right, I've removed my text). France continues to pay on a debt from 1738. But the oldest active debt is Dutch: 

Good question - you have to dig past the superficial to understand, and I'm not fond of the way it is phrased, but the fundamental question is interesting. Here is one example: 

Why did urbanization begin? That's a complex question - population size, technology, capital, governance and other factors affected the growth of urban populations. One of the reasons this question is too broad to be answered is that each society dealt with the problem in different ways. 

Short answer - There were no federal legal prohibitions against weapon ownership in 1789. Long answer. During that year the "United States" had at least 14 governments. For the first two months of the year, the territory was governed by the Articles of Confederation. I haven't reviewed all of the legal precedents under the AoC, but I'm willing to bet my collection of Stack Exchange Hats that AoC had no restrictions on gun ownership. Philosophically, that was an issue that would have been reserved for the states. For the last ten months of the year, the United States was governed by the Constitution. A quick review of the legislation passed that term, indicates that they didn't touch weapons laws. (they hadn't even passed the 2nd amendment yet). Furthermore since the clear intent of the drafters of the constitution was to avoid specifying negative rights, the absence of any mention of weapons, then there were no restrictions on weapon ownership. But I said 14 governments, and I've only touched two. The other 12 were the state governments (Rhode Island didn't ratify the constitution till later). State laws may have restricted weapon ownership. 

Balancing the Budget is very different from eliminating the National Debt. A Balanced Budget simply means that a country made a decrease, no matter how small, in the National Debt over the specified time period (usually a year). Given the horrendous expense of running Louis XIV's court, it is easy to see how the Budget might have improved simply in consequence of his death in 1715. According to Wikipedia's article on Louis XV it was sufficient to stabilize the French currency in order to complete the process of balancing the budget by 1738. However, no mention is made of eliminating the French National Debt. 

I can only venture from this that the casualties were routine enough, after the initial battle introduction, that the men and officers simply got on with their task at hand. 

It is worth refuting the assumption made by OP that the European money supply in 1763 was solely specie, quoting from the conclusion of The Seven Years War and the Old Regime In France: The Economic and Financial Toll, by James C. Riley. 

This attempt at an explanation completely ignores the very high probability that the 1919 influenza strain was related to the 1889-90 Russian flu, as evidenced by its extremely unusual mortality pattern. Without an explanation of this relatedness (to the earlier pandemic), I find it impossible to take this explanation seriously. Update - correction: The 1918-20 influenza has been confirmed by DNA analysis to be an H1N1 strain (swine flu). The best (circumstantial) evidence to date is that the 1888-1889 epidemic was an H3N8 strain, but this cannot be determined with certainty. The unusual mortality pattern for the 1918-20 epidemic is apparently due to a cytokinetic storm in which the body's own immune system is enlisted in a positive feedback loop, resulting in young adults being most susceptible, rather than least susceptible, to mortality. Although it is confirmed that influenza virus can survive for extended periods of time in frozen lakes, there is no evidence at this time that it can survive in soil that regularly thaws. It seems much more likely that the unsanitary conditions of warfare in the trenches, combined with the very large wards common at the time, created ideal conditions for the rapidly mutating Influenza A virus to morph into a fatal and extremely contagious strain. (The two traits are more commonly traded off against each other, except in conditions which keep infected and uninfected individuals in close contact for extended periods of time.)
