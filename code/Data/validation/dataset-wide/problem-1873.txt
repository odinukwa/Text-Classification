are not the same from a hiring manager's perspective or from a recruiter's perspective. Much is made about there being little difference between active and passive candidates, but once one specifically declares himself/herself as an active candidate the difference is very clear. When you add the word 'actively', as in "I am actively seeking new opportunities", it gives the appearance that you have some strong motivation to leave your current job, and thus you should have a specific answer if asked "Why are you looking to leave your current job?". Whether or not you consider yourself an active candidate, making that declaration puts the employer in some potential position of power, and takes away at least a bit of your ability to negotiate and potentially your attractiveness as a candidate. You say you are not desperate, and the word active would suggest that you at least could be. Why might someone be an active job seeker, as opposed to passive? 

If you can't get anything in writing (including proper emails). then you need to immediately move to step two and seek legal advice, even if it's just to determine if the work is likely to land you with negative consequences. 

In my experience this is just life and most people are reasonable because you have to deal with a family emergency. Just pop in ask for some emergency time off. Tell them that you really need to sort this as time is of the essence. Edit: Sorry I misunderstood. Since you're leaving earlier - I'd call him if I had his number, but if not then email him. I would say: 

Most employers in my experience don't want to try people in roles where this no evidence that you'll be ale to do the role. The trick is to add skills and experience to you current job by doing more than is asked and helping others who are doing the things you want to try. This will give you at least business knowledge of those other roles that you can try an leverage when asking for new assignments/tasks and jobs. 

Recruiter here with 15 years of experience. You absolutely want to tell the recruiters you have worked with as soon as possible that you have accepted a position. Chances are the recruiter will ask questions and perhaps try to sway your decision, and since recruiters only get paid for making a placement, there is even a chance that the recruiter will go back to the companies that presented offers to see if they will sweeten the pot a bit and up the offer. If you are 100% decided on accepting one offer, be firm with the recruiters and let them know that you have passed on your commitment to your new employer. Be sure to thank them for their time, and if they treated you well you may want to let them know that you would pass their name along to anyone that you knew was looking for work. Recruiters love referrals, and you don't want to burn any bridges with the recruiter or the hiring companies themselves. You could ask the recruiters if they object to you reaching out directly to the hiring companies with a call/email to thank them for their time and for their consideration. I would have no problem with allowing my candidates to follow-up after declining an offer, but some might have an issue with it (the recruiters that have an issue are the ones you should worry about, and you may be more inclined to contact those particular companies directly). The appropriate person to address the letter to would be the interview team, and HR as well if you had a fair amount of contact with them during the offer process. 

Have routine for starting work - something like always starting at some defined time. I used to walk to the local shop and buy a newspaper. I made sure that I went out at lunchtimes and breaks and talked to people in the neighbourhood. I occasionally made a point of visiting local pubs/restaurants at the time other businesses kicked out so that I would meet people working locally. This sort of simulated "grabbing a few after work with the colleagues". 

This is very clearly a case where your contract and the contract law of your country will come into play. You urgently need to seek out the services of a lawyer who specialises in this kind of work and get advice as to how to proceed. The issue is that your contract may be illegal or perfectly reasonable. Either way you need professional advice on this. 

One week is a fairly reasonable amount of time to provide for an answer (in case you were wondering). 

I don't think it is unethical for you at all. You have found some people you would like to potentially work with, and you are contacting them. Whether you met them at work or through a job ad seems somewhat irrelevant from your standpoint (as an individual employee). If this were a client of your firm, that might be a bit different and could be violating your contract, but as you describe it the situation doesn't seem to be an ethical question for you. I think the ethics question will probably be more difficult for the vendor if they choose to speak with you, even if you are the one approaching them. Your firm may get a bad taste about you leaving for this vendor, even if both you and the vendor are clear about your pursuit of the job. But that is not for you to worry about. The fact that you mention that you are looking to jump ship certainly helps your argument. You are looking to leave regardless, and this vendor is one option. The company may be less inclined to hold a grudge against the vendor if it is clear that you are unhappy and seeking new opportunities. 

Number number numbers + analysis + numbers! What I'm basically saying is that you need to present a business case to whoever makes the decision as why you need one. The easiest case is usually to determine how much more your work costs the company using the existing hardware and how much they'd save if you got different hardware. The costs are not just financial (though they will come down to this at the end), they could be things like impact to other people in terms of delays in getting things to them. Log each time something has gone wrong or taken too long. Did you have to log a support call. How much time did you waste? Did you have to get help from others. Every 12 x 5 minutes adds up to a wasted person hour. Every 5 of these adds up to a wasted day. I've done this for clients where server performance was inadequate, and for where I've need better hardware for specific tasks. Also it's not jsut about asking for "a new computer" - it's about telling them exactly what computer they need to get for you and why it benefits them to do it. 

The math could expose that your current package isn't as great as you think if you go into great detail. Let's say estimated work hours are 40 hours at the new company but 60 at your current firm. If the company making the offer is wise, they will factor all this in. If there is an area that the new company outshines the old, particularly in a hard to quantify area. Example: Your current employer is publicly held, but the new firm is offering you stock options in a private firm, that is hard to quantify and could expose your feelings about the company (if you put little value in those options, it could be construed as a lack of faith in the firm). Opportunity is another. If your current firm is not growing but the company making the offer is expanding, how do you put a dollar value on opportunity to grow? Once you put a dollar figure on your current overall package and the offer being made, you still need to find middle ground on what a reasonable increase is (or whether you would take a lateral). 

Not that I'm saying you should either or . Rather I'm saying you need to define these things and put them into the equation. Finally, and this is very important. 

The point was that I would be lonely during work, but I'd mitigate it by interacting with people every day. These days I use IM and make sure I have non work & work related conversations with colleagues too. An important thing to remember is that you are working, so you need to focus. If you're clever you can use the isolation to help you focus on the work better. This means that you may be more effective but at the same time you have to watch for mental fatigue and a good way to combat is to follow the steps above. These days are lots of things that are accessible via the internet such as meetup.com where you can get together with people for professional or non professional networking. One person I met like this a fellow programmer who lived locally and we used to code review for each other. 

Recruiter here. When I coach candidates on salary negotiation, I always tell them that they are free to speak to the client directly about compensation if they want, but to keep in mind that any number they throw out puts a relatively hard cap on what I can get you. If you list 70K as your desired salary, chances are they will offer a bit less (sometimes, but rarely more), and it will be difficult for me to ask for 73 at that point. Assuming you are not working with a recruiter, you don't have an intermediary or an agent in your negotiations other than yourself. Some of the examples above about insurance contribution being higher than expected or 401k or target bonus being lower than expected are possibilities. Being offered less vacation time that you currently have or than you expected is also an easy one, as vacation days have a quantifiable value (to spitball some numbers, there are 52 weeks x 5 = 260 weekdays/year, subtract say 10 holidays = 250 working days a year, so every 5 day week you work = 2% of salary). The example about commute distance could make you look a bit unprofessional, as in most situations you probably knew the location of the job before you interviewed and applied for it. The other examples about asking for more bonus, extra vacation time, or to change the 401k vesting schedule are not entirely realistic in most cases. Larger companies will probably laugh at the suggestion, small companies may be able to accommodate bonus or vacation but probably not changing a 401k schedule. One valid reason that some candidates will give to increase the requested compensation is a higher responsibility level or work expectation than you expected. Companies will know that if you apply for a job with say no leadership role and they ask you to lead a team, you may want to be compensated for that responsibility. 

Try and get a paper trail with the request. Determine if you think doing it is likely to be either illegal or not. If illegal you should immediately get legal advice. This may prove in valuable in the future. Make a decision as whether you're doing it or not and for what reasons. Face the consequences of doing it or not. 

There is no point in getting well paid if you're going to be stressed out and unhappy. This is a large part of your waking hours that you'll be spending there. 

This doesn't preclude either, but it might give hints as which might be more suitable in the near term. The second criteria I'd use is this: 

Money. You need to supply him with appropriate costing as to why his methodology is going to cost more than yours. Why is it going to takes months to do infrastructure work? What bottom line benefit is there for him to do this work. I'm talking about cold hard numbers. Why are modern practises better? Why should he care? Where is benefit to his customers and ultimately his bottom line. You say he's lost track of practises, well he's likely gained a lot of knowledge on how to make a successful business in spite of those practises. As an engineering team it's your responsibility to provide him with the data so that he can make his decisions. If his practises are going to hurt his business then that's what he needs to hear. At the end of the day, if his metrics are features that the customers can see then you have a problem whereby doing non customer demonstrable work will seem to him to be non focused on his core goals. You have talk to him in his language and that language is numbers. It's all well and good assuming that modern practises will help, but without the data to back it up you're likely to be in a situation where he won't see you as valuable member of staff. edit: I see from your question that he is asking for lots of daily updates, daily demonstrable items, etc. To me this is very much what you'd find in a modern scrum like methodology. In fact I'd go so far as to say perhaps you are misjudging him and his approach. perhaps you should adopt this approach as way for both sides of the battle to move closer to their goals cooperatively. 

I would start by saying you are looking for an X% overall raise, and then lay out all the numbers for them. If they want to provide that, there are only a few that they will be able to adjust in most cases (salary, bonus, stock perhaps). Good luck. 

One potential reason to tell the second alum about the conversation with the first is referral bonus. Assuming you have not yet applied to the company, and you are going to apply, one of these alums might be entitled to some sort of referral bonus from the company if you were to be hired. This may not be an issue, but lots of companies are now offering these bonuses to the employee who referred the candidate into the hiring process. 

What are you not certain about? You say both offer and company are good, so you need to decide what exactly you are waiting for in the job search. Of course something better could always come around, but will it? Some candidates do not want to take the first job offer given (using the 'don't buy the first car you test drive' theory), but what if that offer is indeed the best?
