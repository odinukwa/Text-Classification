I don't think the line between Shinto and Buddhism has been very clear in Japan, just as the line between Hinduism and Buddhism was never very clear in India. For that matter, whenever any religion travels it is forced to either defeat or integrate its newest cultures. Religion can't take prisoners of war, it has to conquer by assimilation or destruction. I don't have personal knowledge of this branch of Buddhism, but I've made use of a search engine to find these sources. Syncretism of Shinto & Buddhism in Japan $URL$ 

There are several monastic orders that currently allow monks to cook their own food, but usually there is a lay community that donates the cash or food. I don't know of anyone who starved merely because there was no one to offer food. The Vinaya is real but so is reality. I think most will find an empty stomach is more real than the Vinaya. In any case the making an honest living, if absolutely necessary isn't a parajika offense - a monastic may prove to his/her peers that it was essential to earn money, and if the peers agree, there is no penalty. Even if it is found to be an honest mistake, it won't be treated as harshly as if one had broken a parajika vow. 

I've had similar experiences. Though Buddhism doesn't directly talk about the Kundalini system or even use the terminology (though Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism has something close or maybe the same in Thummo), reading about it was useful from a systemic analysis perspective. Regardless of any explanation I found, it was ultimately only for curiosity satisfaction. I think the best approach is to continue to practice and to not get carried away by this. Especially not obsessively, as you state. Just observe, remain equanimous and go on about your meditation. One could term it a nimitta in the Theravada tradition, I suppose. In any case, it is a good sign of powerful concentration, keep at it. 

Context First, let me frame my question by establishing a shared understanding of what I mean by "view." Throughout all forms of Buddhism as far as I know, the Four Noble Truths are considered essential Buddhadharma. Included in the 4th Truth is the Eightfold Path, which Bhikkhu Bodhi (in Noble Eightfold Path) describes as follows: 

I don't think I would claim that 24-minute increments are 'ideal', but they've worked in my experience. Perhaps this is simply because I feel tremendous confidence and respect toward Alan Wallace, and am used to working with 24-minute increments in following his instructions. I encourage you to experiment (perhaps taking the gathika as a working hypothesis) and find out what works for your mindstream in light of your aspirations and the specific forms of meditation you wish to pursue. There are many variables to explore! Finally, here's some interesting food for thought, which I think highlights how the appropriate length of a meditation period corresponds to the condition of one's mind, and requires introspective assessment of one's own meditative experience. Padmasambhava has been quoted as saying: 

Cultivating bodhicitta (both ultimate and relative) is absolutely indispensable on the Mahayana path; and one who has vowed to do so is called a bodhisattva. From my understanding, this vow can be made with as little or as much pomp and circumstance as befits one's mind - the key is to inspire confidence and commitment. Check out Shantideva's 'Way of the Bodhisattva' for a truly awesome and beautiful way to undertake this path. Also see Patrul Rinpoche's 'Words of My Perfect Teacher' and his discussion of the vow of bodicitta starting at p. 220. He says: "True absolute bodhicitta is attained by the power of meditation and does not depend on rituals. To generate relative bodhicitta, however, as beginners we need some procedure to follow, a ritual through which we can take the vow in the presence of a spiritual teacher. We then need to constantly renew that vow, in the same way, over and over again, so that the bodhicitta we have aroused does not decline but becomes more and more powerful." The "presence of a spiritual teacher" can be either physical or visualized, based on the various presentations I've encountered. Based on commitment to bodhichitta, one trains in the precepts of aspiration and application. The final fruit is perfect Buddhahood expressed in perfect wisdom and effortless compassion toward all sentient beings - nothing at all limited or 'private' about it! 

Is good to think and say, especially in cases which are not under your controll at all. Your own thoughts are. So give and live best in a way of: "not meant for commercial purpose or other kinds of low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange" Of course beings can accumulate much of demerits, debt an future remorse if even hating or dislike people who actually really care of them, being father and mother for them, but thats their kamma and the outcome at least: who knows... "Do you like to suffer? Suffer, if it makes you fine." Just to let you know: "My person really does not love you." :-) Mudita! [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other kinds of low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange] 

Marijn and who ever might be interested, assuming that the question was raised in seek for release: First: ❋ Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa ❋ Restlessness and Remorse (nervous or scared) is one of the five hindrences and ne needs - aside of it being perceived, become aware of it - by coming aware of it, knowing it as hindrence, be abounded. The means and ways for that are found in a compiled work here, based on teachings by the Buddha, found in the canon: The Five Mental Hindrances and Their Conquest The two mental faculties (indriya), right concentration (samadhi) and right mindfullness (sati) are the means to abound it. The cause of concentration is rature, the cause of rapture is freedom from remorse, or conviction. How is the freedom from remorse developed: by acts of generosity, by keeping the precepts without spot. And how is conviction developed? By reminding the Buddhas quality, the Dhammas quality, the Sanghas quality, by reminding ones generosity, by reminding ones virtue, by reminding, calling in mind, ones virtues equal those of the devas. (The six reflections) So by taking/asking for refuge, by taking/asking for the precepts, by devotion and acts of it as preperation, the basement is developed. See for this required proper prepairation: Respect, Confidence and Patient and probably Devotion, basicly requirement because without respect and gratitude (e.g. right view) no right object of joy, no joy no right concentration, no right concentration no release. So is it that right view is the forrunner for right release and by wrong view wrong releas comes into be. And what is right view? 

As @hellyale suggests in his answer, the Jataka is a good source for tales about the lives of animals, their actions and its consequences. Usually an animal attains merit by selfless acts of devotion - whether it is a dog running into a fire to save a child, or a cow fighting off a much larger animal to protect its calves, or a tiger not killing for wanton pleasure and not deriving pleasure in torturing its victims, such acts lead to an accumulation of merits. Another way, though less certain, is, if one of the progeny from a previous life does great merit as a human or deva and offers it to her ancestors, in whatever realm they may be. Yet another way: In the story of Manduka (Sanskrit: frog) Devaputta (Sanskrit: son of devas) (Chronicle of the Buddhas, Page 1123) - a frog happens to die while listening to the Buddha's sermon, and attains the Tavatimsa Deva realm. The story says the animals can't understand the content of the speech of the Buddha, but the vibrations of love and peace and wisdom can certainly enter the animal. Just as a stray dog understands a boy intends harm even before he picks up a stone to throw at it, some animals are attracted to peaceful people, and the dharma without the need for any words. 

Source: $URL$ p.s. above source goes on to refute this position - but it occurs to me this is treading in muddy water territory since it's the kind of debate no one is truly equipped to answer. Anyone unenlightened would be arguing from a position of bias, and be worried about the implications of consequent gain or loss of power. An enlightened one would probably find the whole debate silly. I find it hard to side with either the Buddhists or the Hindus on this. 

As one's understanding of emptiness and dependent origination deepens, the reasoning that "things appear because they are empty, and are empty because they appear" actually becomes quite compelling and seems quite simple (though profound) when compared to more elaborate analyses such as the "vajra splinters" reasoning (referenced here). 

Sorry, but I am not familiar with the "31 planes of existence" so hopefully someone else can speak to that specifically. But the bottom line to me is that if Buddha knows all beings, he knows their various abodes as well however they are categorized. 

Right view has a very important role in that unfolding. One's very definition of "Noble" or "wisdom" reflects one's view, and in fact it seems that inquiry into and transformation of view is integral to how and where one travels as a sentient being. As Bhikkhu Bodhi writes in the same book: 

On the point of happiness as a 'slippery notion', I think there's a very helpful distinction to make between hedonic and eudaemonic happiness. Roughly speaking (and this is just my take - I welcome refinements or corrections): through the first 2 noble truths, a Buddhist practitioner stops seeking ultimate refuge in hedonic happiness, turning away from the sorrow and disappointment that inevitably follow from putting all of one's eggs in this basket; and through the 3rd and 4th noble truths a practitioner begins to perfect his or her eudaemonic happiness. As to how successful Buddhist practitioners are in this endeavor as a whole... honestly, it's a fascinating question but I have no idea how to answer it empirically on a large scale. For myself and the practitioners I've met, simply turning toward eudaemonic happiness has been a profound and lasting source of joy - a path good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end. 

Things get known when doing, so don't wast time. Tomorrow is not for sure to be and even one day observed is of great fruits, not to speak about sticking with it. Mudita. If questions or need of advices, always welcome, having lived a live of 5, 8, 9, 10 precepts serious still a lay person, there is knowing that it is possible and of benefit. 

➯ 3rd stage, supramundane wisdom: real compassion with all It's already given under one, but maybe a ballade give wisdom for success of being really dear to oneself and so naturally to every being by leaving the states of demerits as well as merits behind: 

Late Upasaka Goenka gave a very detailed teaching, based on cannonical references: Why Was the Sakyan Republic Destroyed?, Robert Michael. On seeing the importance here: Dhamma is unwisely grasped, if used for politic and wordily gains: 

All of course "dutiesk in reagard of the Holly Life and for Nibbanas sake, the strive for it as highest underlying responsibility. There is no responsibility in regard of lay people, aside of certain conducts of "foreign - policy" for the sake of estimation of the Sangha at large, by Bhikkhus. The gift of teaching the Dhamma is a individual total voluntary act of goodness (if not made out of corruption and the sake of livelihood and requisits: such is not allowed). Further readings: 

And it is not so, as suggested in an answer here, that a deed has a share instantly, later and much later in terms of the law of kamma. It's either this or that. Generally "be careful", since
