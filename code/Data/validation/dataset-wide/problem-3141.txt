DID TUVA VOLUNTARILY REJOIN? Note: Tuva had been annexed by Russia in 1914, had then changed hands a number of times before the Tuvan People's Republic was set up in 1921 by Bolsheviks This is impossible to answer with certainty as we cannot know for sure that Stalin didn’t tell Toka: ‘join the Soviet Union or else...’ However, as the Toka regime had requested annexation in 1939, 1941 and 1943 (the requests had been turned down, probably due to bad timing), it seems likely that the 1944 request was, if not initiated by the Tuva leadership, eagerly made by them following a request or suggestion from Stalin. The reasons for the Tuvan leadership's eagerness were probably (1) a fear of China’s hostile intentions (see below) and (2) the economic reality of being a small, underdeveloped land-locked state which needed strong economic links (as well as aid) from its powerful neighbour. Whether the population at large agreed with the annexation will never be known - they weren't asked as there was never a referendum. Ironically, this effectively meant that the annexation was illegal under the Soviet's own constitution. The lack of a referendum can probably be attributed to the desire to keep the annexation out of the news and / or to the delay it would cause. As the Tuvan population was predominantly nomadic (82.2% according to the 1931 census), there was unlikely to be much organized opposition anyway - most of them wouldn't even have known about the annexation for quite a while. 

This much is clear enough. However, I'm curious about the man on the left and the man leaning over the side. For the man on the left, I'm guessing he's holding something to check the depth of the river. Can anyone confirm this? For the man leaning over the side, he is holding something in his hand. What is it and what is he doing? 

Neither Cassius Dio nor Herodian appear to make any mention of lovers, or children resulting from any such liaisons, though that does not mean there weren't any. It seems more likely, given his character, that Caracalla bedded any woman who came to his attention (not a problem for an emperor presumably, especially one with so few scruples) but, again, there is no evidence for this. Caracalla did have a daughter with his wife Fulvia Plautilla. They were strangled on his orders after he had exiled them. According to Herodian, Caracalla did propose marriage to the daughter of King Artabanus IV of Parthia, but this appears to be nothing more than a trick to slaughter a lot of Parthians. At first, this was turned but eventually the king agreed. Later, 

Among the favourite names were 'Nike' and names which referred to a ship's ability and 'sureness to succeed'. Geographical and animal names were also used, as well as deities, adjectives ('golden') and abstract nouns. These names were mostly given to triremes, a few to quadriremes

He polished his French during his time in Paris, before he went to work for Duke Johann Friedrich (of Brunswick - Lüneburg - Calenberg) as Privy Counsellor at a court where the language was French. Leibniz spent quite some time in England, meeting many people there, so it is not unlikely that he also spoke English at least reasonably well. He also spent over a year in Italy, his knowledge of Italian demonstrated by this story which he liked to tell: 

When the purpose was friendship, feasting, peace or toasting with alcohol, it seems entirely appropriate not to put down a drinking vessel until it has been drained. In fact, the tradition of emptying the horn continues to this day in, for example, Georgia where the "the glass (or horn!) has to be drunk ad fundum". However, horns were not just used for alcohol but also for milk and water and for decorative purposes, drinking or otherwise. It was common (and still is in poor communities) to use every last scrap of an animal (e.g. the Vikings) so it wouldn't make sense not to make use of something that could be fashioned into an impressive-looking drinking vessel. At the same time, it would be wrong to think that all horns had to be emptied: there is plenty of evidence of horn stands. For example, 

Has there been a similar analysis of the Anglo-Saxon chronicles which will back up M & H. Whittock's assertion that "We should not expect anything different for Anglo-Saxon England", and has there been any statistical analysis of the Frankish chronicles? The statistics refer to raids on ecclesiastical sites. Is there any indication in the chronicles / annals as to whether non-ecclesiastical sites were more or less likely to be attacked by Vikings than by local rulers? 

Note: the 'rant' that you heard on the radio may stem from Charles Higham's 'Trading with the Enemy'. This book makes various claims concerning, among other things, the relationship between Standard Oil and IG Farben, the German company which made synthetic fuel. Without wishing to give the impression that every American industrialist's hands were spotlessly clean, it should be noted that Higham is not a professional historian (he mostly wrote sensationalized Hollywood biographies) and has, in several of his books, made claims which cannot be substantiated (e.g. 'Errol Flynn was a Nazi spy'). A review of the book can be found here. 

For many years, Leibniz communicated (in Latin) with Jesuits priests in China as he was deeply interested in Chinese thought, culture and language, all three of which he devoted a considerable amount of study time to. In addition this, as a linguist with a particular interest in constructing an artificial language, Leibniz studied a variety of languages, including Welsh, Danish and Sanskrit (but there is no firm evidence that wrote in or spoke any of these).

As these fleeing inhabitants lived to tell the tale, it is fair to assume that Attila was not enthroned in what was their new home. 

Higgins notes that this has been taken to mean (wrongly, in her view) that “women’s votes are discounted by the reference to cattle” by the writer and academic Carol Diethe, so it is not inconcievable that others misinterpreted Nietzsche as comparing women to cows on the topic of voting. 

According to an article in the Washington Post dated June 6th, the broadcasts to be made from July 2nd onward had been tested during 'the past three weeks'. Thus, the windmill program and (presumably) those which followed it were not experimental broadcasts as the equipment had already been tested.

FRANCE From Clovis I (b. circa 466) to Louis XI (d. 1483) average 40.4 years (64 monarchs) This excludes the disputed reign of the English Lancastrian King Henry VI. Kings up to Louis VII (died 1180) were Kings of the Franks. None of the French kings in this time period had particularly long lives but more than half (12 of them) passed the age of 50. John the Posthumous had the shortest life: born 6 months after his father Louis X died, John lived just 5 days. An analysis of the average age at death of French kings by House shows a clear pattern. 

So, why did 1920s Danish governments apparently move in the opposite direction to other 'rich' countries by favouring agriculture in terms of structural development? 

SHORT ANSWER Films at the time were generally considered to have little, if any, artistic value. Nor was it believed that they had any commercial value once they had been seen by the public. Thus, their only value lay in the materials and chemicals the film stock contained, a value which increased during the First World War when these and many other materials were in short supply.

There is also a much more recent facsimile, Ancient Mayan Message: Dresden Codex Facsimile by Olga Judith Najarro Ibarra (2017) but I have not been able to trace any peer reviews for this book.

SHORT ANSWER Although France (especially) had the means and the motive to support the 1987 coup, there is currently no conclusive evidence of French, US or other Western powers involvement. However, this may change in the coming months as the French President, Emmanuel Macron, recently promised to declassify files relating the death of Thomas Sankara. Given that Sankara had alienated much of the local elite and given that the coup leader (Compaore) was highly placed within the Sankara government, it is doubtful if much (or even any) French or American help would have been needed to carry out the coup. There has, though, been an admission of involvement by former Liberian warlord, now senator, Prince Johnson. DETAILED ANSWER Evidence of direct French or American involvement in the Blaise Compaore-led coup of October 1987 is hard to pin down but there is little doubt that the French were not unhappy at the demise of Thomas Sankara’s regime. However, as Sankara had alienated both the domestic political elite and the unions (a number of prominent union leaders were detained in May 1987), it is doubtful whether Compaore needed any external help in ousting his former friend. Internal divisions were evident, and Sankara’s faction within the ruling Conseil National de la Revolution became increasingly isolated. Most of those in power were not prepared to follow Sankara’s Spartan lifestyle and resented demands such as having to give up part of their salaries to help fund projects for the rural poor. That said, the French definitely had the means and motive to bring about a regime change if they so wished, and it appears that they intervened in May 1983 when Sankara, then Prime Minister, was detained ‘following a French intervention’ (quoted from G. Martin). Sankara was determined to combat the adverse effects of neo-colonialism and was very anti-French. France has always had a very favourable trade balance with its former West African colonies and evidence of French economic and cultural influence among the elite is widespread. Any move to lessen those ties was a direct threat to French commercial and political interests. The political elite of Burkina Faso’s (comparatively) wealthy southern neighbour Ivory Coast were also opposed to the Sankara regime. Of all the former French colonies, the Ivory Coast under its President Felix Houphouet-Boigny had the closest ties to France. By the early 1980s, the Ivorian ‘economic miracle’ of the 1960s and 1970s was over, and discontent at widespread corruption and the lack of political freedom in a one-party state was on the increase. Sankara’s removal of officials’ privileges and attention-grabbing actions, such as selling off the government’s fleet of Mercedes cars and telling officials they would have to make do with the Renault 5, had many Ivorians wondering if some of Sankara’s policies might not be usefully applied to their own pampered officials. With the radical Jerry Rawlings-led Ghana on its eastern border, the Ivorian government was unhappy at having another revolutionary / radical neighbour to the north. Not surprisingly, the establishment of a political body in August 1986 to plan a political union of Ghana and Burkina Faso did not go down well with other countries (mostly former French colonies) in the region. Further, Sankara’s policies aimed at alleviating poverty (especially in rural areas), if successful in the long-term, would have threatened the supply of the cheap Burkinabe labour needed to work on the coffee and cocoa plantations which were the mainstay of the Ivorian economy. Compaore, who had married a relative of the Ivorian President Houphouet-Boigny in 1985, reversed almost all of Sankara’s policies when he took over the presidency. The changes were welcomed by both France and Ivory Coast. Commenting on why he overthrew Sankara, Compaore said:
