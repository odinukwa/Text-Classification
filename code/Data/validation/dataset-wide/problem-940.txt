A good place to looking is geostatistics. It is a branch of statistics focusing on spatial or spatiotemporal datasets. In its earlier days, geostatistics was also known as the theory of regionalized variables. Geostatistics was initially developed by George Matheron, a French mathematician and geologist - though when I first heard about him in the 1980s he was described as a mining engineer. Matheron developed geostatistics to find a better way to determined ore reserves more accurately. His other other aim was to try to ascertain a level of accuracy for ore reserves (i.e x ounces of gold at a confidence of y %) . Since the initial development of geostatistics in the 1960s for ore reserves in mining, the technique has been used in other fields where there is a spatial co-relation between data samples, such a forestry, pollution contamination around metal smelters, soil science, geochemistry, etc. One of the key tools of geostatistics is the variogram. The variogram is used to determine the distance at which samples can be regarded as being independent of each other. The mathematics for variograms can look bewildering, but variograms can be explained simply. Consider a line of 100 equally spaced sample points, say 1 metre apart. 

Assuming a well has a diameter of 2 metres, even 5 metres. This would be an exceedingly small target area for a satellite, some hundreds to thousands of kilometres above the Earth to find. Being buried, particularly at 200 metres depth, increases the difficulty exponentially. Satellites are better at finding minerals on the surface, or just below the surface, not at 200 metres depth. 

Surveying is the process of taking topographical measurements of latitude, longitude and elevation. It is also the process of marking out lines for engineering/construction designs of such things as roads, tunnels, fence lines, boundaries & foundations of buildings. Surveying provides the topographical data that cartographers, engineers and other professionals use for their purposes. 

The average density of air at sea level is is $1.225$ $kg/m^3$ and the elevation of Johannesburg is $1500$ $m$. The equivalent column of air would have a pressure of $P$ $=$ $1.225(9.8)(1500)$ $=$ $18$ $007$ $Pa$ Divide this by $100$ to get hectopascals gives $180$ $hPa$ If the synoptic chart gives a pressure of $1020$ $hPa$ Then, $1020 - 180$ $=$ $840$ $hPa$ 

The website you provide a link for gives the horizon distance as: $d$ $\approx$ $1.23\sqrt{h}$ where d is in miles and h is height above ground level in feet. Rearranging the equation $h$ $\approx$ $(d/1.23)^2$ For a horizon distance of 2300 miles, the height would have to be 3,496,596 feet, or 662.2 miles. For a flat Earth, it depends on the height of any obstacles between Washington DC & LA and the distance the obstacle is from either LA or Washington. If there are no obstacles, no height is required as light from LA can travel across the flat plane to Washington. If you want to account for impedance provided by the Rocky Mountains, use Google Earth & draw a line between LA & Washington. A high point of around 9600 feet occurs some 780 miles from LA. By using similar triangles such a height at Washington would be 28,308 feet. 

This has always bothered me during field mapping: A boudin with two stretching directions has the form of an M&M candy (or almond shape). What do I do to measure the two stretching directions if the surrounding rocks don't show any stretching lineations. Does anybody have experience with this? 

The liquid outer core and the magnetic field it generates are essential to life. Without the magnetic field we would have no atmosphere. The temperatures would be roughly equal to the moon (Which goes from 123 C on the hemisphere that happens to face the sun and -153 C on the shadowed hemisphere). Source for moon temperatures: $URL$ 

Starting from the bottom of your question I would not compare planets with plate tectonics with planets that don't have this process. During rifting of a tectonic plate a triple junction will be the most favourable way of faulting the crust. After that two arms of the rift are favoured and the third one becomes a failed rift (aulacogen). Because of this process linear features on a planet will be very emphasized. The current geometry of mid ocean ridges and subduction zones does fall into a strong north-south pattern (Exceptions are Antarctica and the Aleutian trench). This might also be due to the fact that the plates form a system that in all its complexity still strives for lower stress and effective heat transport. In this case a parallel system of mid-ocean-ridges and subduction zones might be more favourable than a totally random alignment of those features. The dynamics of the inner Earth are of course not independent of the plates and it is difficult to assign causality. Nonetheless you could again think of a complex system that seeks for efficiency (pragmatism if you will). With subduction plates being plate-shaped, circulation above and beneath them will probably be more stable in a cylindrical fashion. So the heat distribution on the upwelling side of the circulation should also create linear features. In any case we just happen to live in a time where the system went for a North-South oriented minimum. Continuing this thought process we can also find an explanation why features in this tectonic-north-south part of the world are oriented in this way. Many north-south striking islands have north-south striking back-arc-basins that separate them from their main land masses. And peninsulas are sometimes the arms of failed rifts or the tapering of back-arc-basins. Outside of this prevalent orientation we see features like Nowaja Semlja with very different orientations. But be cautious with this theory. Assigning each feature on Earth to a north-south and east-west orientation gives you a 50 % chance that a randomly aligned feature will confirm your theory. Even four directions still give you 25 % chance. So the more directions you consider the harder it is to prove the theory. I am not aware of anybody doing a global peninsula inventory, so it would be interesting to see this. 

I doubt that could be answered with anything better than a rough guesstimate. We would first need to know how much land is OFFICIALLY/LEGALLY protected. Then we would have to subtract acreage to allow for illegal logging or general environmental destruction. There are also areas that aren't legally protected but nevertheless aren't logged simply because they're very remote, the terrain is too rugged, etc. In addition, it's a moving target. Various governments around the world continually modify their environmental management policies and practices. A forest that's protected today might fall prey to a bribe from some giant oil company tomorrow. 

Are you asking how the land area that is devoted to tree plantations compares to the land area covered with wild forests? Again, I don't know the answer, but please note that there are vast differences between plantations and wild forests. Plantations may be preferable to barren earth, but they don't begin to compare to "natural forests" in terms of biodiversity. Tree farms are to Nature what fast food is to cuisine. I fear for Africa more than South America. The Amazon is obviously a cause for concern, but there is some political stability in South America, and there are environmental activists there. In comparison, Africa appears to be lost. How many acres have been converted to genetically modified food? I've read about thousands of traditional African farmers being replaced by GMO, though there isn't much information on the subject. Libya's destruction by NATO was an enormous blow for Africa (and the world). And for whatever it's worth, I believe Colonel Gaddafi was generally regarded as an environmentalist, at least in comparison to other African leaders. There have long been predictions that the next cold war will be fought between the U.S. and China over Africa's natural resources. In fact, the U.S. has troops stationed in just about every country in Africa, and I just read that China is building a military base there. In summary, forest loss is a huge problem in South America, but there is at least some hope. I predict that it will be a much bigger problem in Africa in the long run. 

Again, that's very hard to answer. Forest destruction is an ongoing process around the world. Forests in the most remote regions are typically the safest, but they will become more vulnerable as surrounding forests are felled, new roads are built, more people move into these remote areas, etc. Another factor to consider is war, or political corruption in general. So many governments have been destabilized (primarily by the U.S.), and so many governments are grappling with economic woes or fears of invasion. Not surprisingly, they're going to emphasize security and survival over the environment. Of course, war itself can take a toll. Consider Vietnam, where the U.S. used Agent Orange indiscriminately. I believe the Soviets similarly wiped out much of Afghanistan's montane forests. 

Under the assumption that we don't know anything about sampling, preparation and analysis we have to proceed with caution. Any of these steps can introduce effects that can produce stronger signals than the natural geochemistry of a rock sample. Just to give you an idea of the errors: 

It is very likely that there will always be phosphorous for mining, because rising demand will increase prizes, and make more mining sites profitable (This is like the golden rule of mining and seen for example with oil sands suddenly being profitable). From a crystalline-rock perspective (this is just a partial answer) the phosphate minerals are a huge phosphorous sink. Prominent members of this group are Apatite, Monazite and Xenotime, which occur widely in granitic rocks. The problem with these minerals is that they can contain high percentages of radioactive elements and submicroscopic inclusions with even higher radioactivity. This has already contributed to the rise of radioactivity on fertilized fields and rivers that run from them ($URL$ This is relevant to your question because radioactivity and the isotopes that produce it, can be used as a tracer for phosphorous. 

As you can see there is a staggering area of Earth covered by sedimentary basins, and all those basins have a certain volume under oil generating conditions. You will probably also need a rough estimate of how much oil can come out of an average source-rock, and how much will be trapped in economically profitable host-rock traps. Maybe a factor that takes into account the basin type, would also help to improve the calculation (Compressional basins would have a lot of antiform traps, while extensional basins have tilted bed traps). I have the feeling that the total oil inventory of Earth is probably a Logistic function. Once all the oil traps are filled all the excessive oil is lost to migration or too much heat. Empty traps would mean that oil would find a place to accumulate. So it might even be a self-stabilizing system (but not in human-time-scale, but let's see how long we last). I think that this would yield an order-of-magnitude answer. It is possible that somebody already made these calculations and I would love to see the numbers. Footnote: Oil, like all resources, follows mining economics. If you earn money, you mine, if you loose money, you leave. This also means that if more money can be earned, there are also more deposits worth the effort. Calculations with today's reserves are almost useless, because they can't predict what people will be willing to pay for oil in the future. Even if mining becomes unprofitable, we might produce synthetic oil, just because it is a convenient chemical (energy stored in relation to mass, diffusivity, and danger). We kind of already have that with rapeseed oil, which sadly can get a better price to power rich countries cars, than feed poor countries people.
