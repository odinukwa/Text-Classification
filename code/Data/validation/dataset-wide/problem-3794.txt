Take $M=\mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z}$, $T(x)=x+\alpha$ for some $\alpha$. If $\alpha$ is irrational, all orbits will be dense. Set $p=0$, then the set $A$ can be made to be infinite by choosing an $\alpha$ that can be approximated well: choose $\alpha$ from $B_1(\delta-2\cdot 10^{-k_1})$ for some $k_1$, then modify it at most by $10^{-k_1}$to make $10^{k_1} \alpha -[10^{k_1} \alpha] \in B_{10^{k_1}}(\delta-2 \cdot 10^{-k_2})$ and repeat ad infinitum. 

Maximum likelihood estimate is the smallest $n$ for which $$\left( 1+\frac{1}{n} \right)^k \leq \frac{n}{n-k+1},$$ that gives a value of $n$ asymptotically equal to $\frac{k^2}{2}$, consistently with the Birthday Paradox. Not sure whether an unbiased estimate would be better for any practical purpose; maybe you do have an a priori distribution for which a Bayesian estimate makes sense? 

I'll assume you're talking about principal G-bundles. These are classified by maps into $BG$, the base of the universal $G$-bundle, so if we have bundles classified by $f:E \to BG$ and $g:F \to BG$, you are looking for a bordism between $f$ and $g$ - whether there exists a $h : W \to BG$ connecting these classifying maps. So there is a bundle cobordism between the two bundles iff the bordism classes of $f$ and $g$ in $\mathfrak{N}n(BG)$ coincide, and if they do coincide, then the choice of $W$ is parametrized by the bordism group $\mathfrak{N}_{n+1}(BG)$. I don't know an algorithmic way to obtain the class $[f]$ from $E$, but there is a splitting $\mathfrak{N}_n(BG) = \oplus H_j(BG) \otimes \mathfrak{N}_{n-j}$ which can help identify some bundles' classes. 

Think of $SU(n)$ as the space of orthonormed bases in $C^n$ with the additional property of the determinant being equal to $1$ out of all the unit length complex numbers. Then fixing one of the vectors restricts the others to the orthogonal hyperplane and the additional requirement remains intact for some parametrization of said hyperplane. In the coordinate system defined by such a base, all the others with the same first vector differ only by a matrix of the form $1 \oplus A$ with some $A \in SU(n-1)$. It does sound too much like a homework question to me though. 

Greg's otherwise excellent answer gives the impression that computing Chern classes on projective space requires a computer algebra system. I'm writing to repell this impression. The cohomology ring of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ is $\mathbb{Z}[h]/h^n$ where $h$ is Poincare dual to the class of a hyperplane. We have the short exact sequence $$0 \to S \to \mathbb{C}^n \to Q \to 0$$, where $S$ is the tautological line bundle, whose fiber over a point of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ is the corresponding line in $\mathbb{C}^n$. The line bundle $S$ is also called $\mathcal{O}(-1)$, and has Chern class $1-h$. So $$c(Q) = 1/(1-h) = 1+h+h^2 + \cdots h^{n-1}.$$ As Greg explained, the tangent bundle is $\mathrm{Hom}(S, Q) = S^{\star} \otimes Q$. The formula for the Chern class of a general tensor product is painful to use in practice, but we can circumvent that here by tensoring the above exact sequence by $S^{\star}$. $$0 \to \mathbb{C} \to (S^{\star})^{\oplus n} \to T_{\mathbb{P}^{n-1}} \to 0$$, So the Chern class of the tangent bundle to $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ is $$(1+h)^n = 1 + n h + \binom{n}{2} h + \cdots + n h^{n-1}.$$ Yes, I deliberately ended that sum one term early. Remember that $h^n$ is $0$. As Greg says, if this is to be expressible as a direct sum1 of line bundles, then this should be a product of $n-1$ linear forms, $c(T) = \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (1+ a_i h)$. Since this is an equality of polynomials of degree $n-1$, we can forget that we are working modulo $h^n$ and just check whether the honest polynomial $f(x) := 1 + n x + \binom{n}{2} x + \cdots + n x^{n-1}$ factors in this way. The answer is it does not, except when $n=2$ (the case of $\mathbb{P}^1$.) The unique factorization of $f(x)$ is $$\prod_{\omega^n=1,\ \omega \neq 1} (1+x (1-\omega)).$$ Thus does raise an interesting question. When $n$ is even, $(1+2x)$ divides $f(x)$. This suggests that $\mathcal{O}(2)$ might be a subquotient of $T_{\mathbb{P}^{n-1}}$. I can't figure out whether or not this happens. 

This is parallel transport. Note that you only get an explicit formula for the isomorphism between $F_1^*H(\mathbb{T})$ and $F_2^*H(\mathbb{T})$. To get explicit formulas over other thickenings of $\mathbb{T}$, you would need lifts of both $\mathbb{T}$ and also of the Frobenius lifts. For convenience, set $H_1=H(\mathbb{T})$. We will assume that $\mathbb{T}$ has \'etale co-ordinates $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. Since $H_{\mathbb{T}}$ is a crystal over $\mathbb{T}$, there is a flat connection $\nabla:H_1\to H_1\otimes\Omega^1_{\mathbb{T}/W_2(k)}$. Note that, for any $a\in\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{T}}$, $\delta(a)=F_1(a)-F_2(a)$ is in $p\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{T}}$; in particular, $\delta(a)^2=0$. Now, for any $h\in H_1$, the isomorphism sends $F_1^*h$ to $F_2^*h+\sum_{i=1}^n\nabla(\partial_i)(m)\delta(x_i)$. This is just a Taylor expansion up to the first degree. 

Suppose $K/\mathbb{Q}\_p$ is a finite extension with residue field $k$. Fix a uniformizer $\pi\in K$ and choose a coherent sequence $(\pi^{1/p^n})$ of $p$-power roots of $\pi$, and let $K_\infty/K$ be the extension of $K$ generated by these roots. The field $K_\infty$ is arithmetically pro-finite and so we can consider its field of norms, which happens to be isomorphic to the function field $k((u))$. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a Cohen ring for $k((u))$, equipped with a lift $\varphi$ of Frobenius. Conventionally, we take this to be the $p$-adic completion of $W(k)[[u]]_{(u)}$ and $\varphi$ sends $u$ to $u^p$. Then we have equivalences: $G_{K_\infty}$-reps $\Leftrightarrow$ $G_{k((u))}$-reps $\Leftrightarrow$ etale $\varphi$-modules over $\mathcal{R}$. Although I've known this basic theory for a while, I realized I did not know the answers to some elementary questions, and couldn't immediately find them in the literature. It seems to me that these are toy examples of the theory and should appear somewhere! Question 1: Let $\chi$ be the restriction of the $p$-adic cyclotomic character to $G_{K_\infty}$. Is there a nice description of the corresponding character of $G_{k((u))}$? In other words, what is the norm field extension of $k((u))$ corresponding to $K_\infty(\mu_{p^\infty})$? Question 2: By the second equivalence, there should be a 'cyclotomic' period in $\mathcal{R}$ that transforms under $G_{k((u))}$ by the character that is the answer to Question 1. Can we write it down explicitly? 

As GH from MO says, it depends what you think is a closed form. Any function of the form $P(n)/Q(n)$ with $\deg P \leq \deg Q -2$ can be written as a linear combination of $1/(n+1) - 1/(n+\alpha)$ and $1/(n+\alpha)^k$, for various $\alpha$ and various $k>1$. (Use partial fraction decomposition. The bound on $\deg P$ ensures that the coefficients of $1/(n+1)$ will cancel out.) The sum $\sum \left( \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n+\alpha} \right)$ is $\gamma+\psi(\alpha)$, where $\psi$ is the digamma function. The sum $\sum \frac{1}{(n+\alpha)^k}$ is the polygamma function $\psi^k(z)$. In both cases, it is worth noting the recurrence identities and reflection relations in the linked Wikipedia articles, which let you relate values at $\alpha$ to values at $m \pm \alpha$, for $m$ an integer. 

As Denis Serre points out, this problem subsumes the problem of factoring single variable polynomials, so I'm going to assume that you already have software on hand to do that (probably numerically). In that case, here's what I'd do. For simplicity, presented first in the case of a homogenous polynomial $F(x,y,z)$ in three variables, so a curve in the projective plane. Pick a line $L$ in the plane and find out where it meets your curve. This amounts to solving a single variable polynomial equation $F(x_0+at, y_0+bt, z_0+ct)=0$ for some constants $(x_0, y_0, z_0$ and $(a,b,c)$. If any of the roots are extremely close to each other, this suggests that $L$ is passing very close to where two of your lines cross; discard this data and try again with another $L$. So now we have $n$ points $z_1$, $z_2$, ..., $z_n$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$, one on each of your lines. Repeat with a second line $M$ to get points $w_1$, $w_2$, ..., $w_n$. Then, for each $(z_i, w_j)$, see whether your polynomial vanishes on the line through $z_i$ and $w_j$. This is just a matter of plugging $z_i + t w_j$ into $F$. Remember that, when you work with floating point numbers, you should never check whether something equals zero, but rather whether it is very small. Because we chose the $z_i$ and $w_i$ well away from the intersections of your lines, the restriction of $F$ to $z_i + t w_j$ should not be particularly small if $z_i$ and $w_j$ do not lie on the same line. So you can figure out which $z_i$ lies on a factor of $F$ with which $w_j$, and then recover that factor by linear algebra. For a polynomial in $d+1$ variables, use $d$ lines to get $n d$ points. Computing the restriction of $F$ to $(d-1) n^2$ lines will then tell you which of your points to group together. 

The expected connectivity cannot be higher than the expected minimal degree, which jumps to roughly $pn$ after getting into the range $p>>\frac{\log n}{n}$. On the other hand, sloppily counting potential clusters of size $m < n/2$ that have boundaries of less than $k$ vertices gives a probability of $\binom{n}{m}\binom{n-m}{k}(1-p)^{m(n-m-k)}$, which is for $k < < n$ decreasing in $m$ up to $m\approx \frac{n-k}{2}$ and increasing after that value, so we can get an estimate by considering only $m=1$ (checking for vertices with at most $k$ neighbours) and $m=\frac{n}{2}$: $$ \binom{n}{n/2}\binom{n/2}{k}(1-p)^{n(n-2k)/4} < exp(n \log 2+k \log n - pn(n-2k)/4) < $$ $$ < exp(n \log 2 - pn(\frac{n}{4}-\frac{k}{2}-\log n)) < exp(-\frac{n \log n}{4} + n \log 2 +2(\log n)^2), $$ this latter number tending to $0$ fast enough to ignore it. So, the expected connectivity is the expected minimal degree and is roughly $pn$ once $p$ exceeds $\log n/n$. Do you need the behaviour of expected connectivity specifically in this region? 

Consider the complete graph on 7 vertices. It has 21 edges, so any set of cycles that utilizes each edge at most twice has size at most 42/3=14. But the cycle space of the graph has dimension 21-7+1=15, so you cannot have a basis with the requested property. 

Not even all regular polytopes would have this property: any polytope having property X would have vertex figures with at most two kinds of distances between its vertices, and the 24- and 600-cells have the cube and the icosahedron for a vertex figure. Apart from those two examples, though, all regular polytopes have your property, and at least the regular prism has it as well as a regular pentagonal pyramid. No idea whether there are more examples. 

The ratio of areas of $ABC$ and $ACD$ is the ratio in which the line $AC$ divides the segment $BD$ (and it is the ratio of the heights of $B$ and $D$ over $AC$ respectively). This later ratio is affine invariant as affine transformations preserve length ratios on any line. Do make sure that your points don't collapse onto a single line though. 

To expand on my comment to the question, we have the following algebraic construction (I think originally due to Robert Brown, 'A characterization of spin representations'): Let $V$ be a quadratic space over a field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$. Attached to this is the Clifford algebra $C=C(V)$: it is equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-grading $C=C^+\oplus C^-$ and an embedding $V\hookrightarrow C^-$. The general Spin group $GSpin(V)$ consists of units in $C^+$ that preserve $V$ under conjugation. The group $Spin(V)$ is the sub-group of elements that have trivial spinor norm. So, to describe $Spin(V)$ as an automorphism group, it suffices to do so for $GSpin(V)$. Let $H$ be the graded vector space $C$ viewed as a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via left multiplication: it is also a right $C$-module via right multiplication. Then $GSpin(V)$ clearly lies within the group $U(H)$ of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$. Set $E=End(H)$: this is a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via conjugation. Define a bilinear form $\{,\}:E\times E\to k$ by $$\{f,g\}=\frac{1}{2^{dim(V)}}trace(fg).$$ Now choose a basis $\{v_i\}$ for $V$, and let $A=(v_i\cdot v_j)_{i,j}$ be the inner product matrix attached to this basis. Set $(b_{i,j})=B=A^{-1}$. Define an endomorphism $\pi:E\to E$ by the formula: $$\pi(f)(h)=\sum_{i,j}b_{i,j}\{v_i,f\}v_jh.$$ Clearly, the image of $\pi$ is $V\subset E$, where $V$ acts on $H$ via left multiplication. Let $G'\subset U(H)$ be the stabilizer of the endomorphism $\pi$. Then $G'$ preserves $V$ via conjugation, and is therefore contained in $GSpin(V)$. On the other hand, it is not hard to see that $GSpin(V)$ stabilizes $\pi$. So we see that $GSpin(V)$ can be described as the group of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$ that also stabilize $\pi$. 

The answer is no, in general. The problem is to find an embedding so that the minuscule character corresponding to the Shimura datum for $S$ induces the minuscule character of $GSp_{2n}$ corresponding to a decomposition into Lagrangians. In the affirmative direction, for most classical, simply connected groups (and only for classical groups, i.e. of types $A$,$B$,$C$ and $D$), the answer is yes; some subtleties crop up for $Spin^*(2n)$ (this is the so called $D^{\mathbb{H}}$ case), for which only the quotient by an order 2 central sub-group admits a symplectic embedding (of Shimura data). This is all beautifully laid out in Deligne's article 'Varietes de Shimura...' here, following Satake here. See also Proposition 1.21 in Milne's article here
