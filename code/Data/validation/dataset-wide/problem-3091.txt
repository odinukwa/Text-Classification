Before the Romans took over Egypt, Sicily and Africa were the primary sources of grain. ("Africa" in the Roman context means just the Northwest portion of the continent.) These areas continued to be a major source of grain until the provinces were lost to first the Vandals and later the Muslims after the fall of the Western Empire. Italy itself ceased to be able to feed itself quite early. Basically the only way Rome could support the population it had in the late Republican and early Empire (over a million people) was through massive grain imports from throughout the whole Mediterranean. The Western Collapse accelerated when Africa was lost to the Vandals, and the loss of Egypt to the Muslims hurt the Eastern Empire critically. Without the grain shipments, the city of Rome fell to a population of less than a hundred thousand. 

It's a big assumption that they knew. At the time, Salem was the middle of nowhere, with a colony founded specifically to keep to itself. The trials themselves would likely not have attracted much attention, especially since witch trials were happening all through Europe during that period. In the 250 years before 1750, around 40,000 witches were executed The Salem Witch Trials only became famous because they happened in a small place that ended up as a cultural core of a powerful country. Asking what Newton thought of the Salem Witch Trials is a bit like asking what Neil DeGrasse Tyson thinks about the a particular couple killed for homosexuality in Dubai. 

Here's a reference to an attempt to use a "ski sledge" by Fridtjof Nansen during his crossing of Greenland in 1887. This is fourteen years after the book was published, so this obviously isn't the inspiration for the plot point. But at least someone tried it, though in a more ad hoc fashion than described in the book. 

Ok, this is an answer to the literal question, not the spirit of the question: The largest place named after an animal is the Tadpole Galaxy as it has a volume in the millions of cubic light years and appears to be the only named galaxy named after an animal. 

So we can see that the Burmese at the time used both horses and elephants. Another major country the Mongols was unable to conquer was Japan. According to wiki again the horse arrived in Japan around the 4th century AD. It was certainly a major component of Japanese society in the middle ages. Of course, jungle terrain is far less conducive to the use of horses than the open plains of Mongolia, so you likely saw much less usage in places like Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, but the animals were certainly known throughout the region, given that the horse is one of the animals in the Chinese Zodiac and that the entire region of Southeast Asia looked to China for much of their scientific and philosophical knowledge. 

If you define "traitorous" as "rebelling against a country you once served", then there's Joseph Wheeler who served in the US military, went to fight against the US military as a Confederate officer, then later fought for the US military in the Spanish American war. There are many in the US who take great exception to the idea that Confederate soldiers were "traitors", though. 

Both Scipio Africanus: Greater Than Napoleon by Basil Liddell Hart and The Punic Wars by Adrian Goldsworthy are good sources. Alternatively, wikipeadia... In a nut shell: superior tactics and strategy. 

Depending on your definition of corporation, you could claim that Venice and other merchant cities of Italy were akin to corporations. Guilds could well be said to have been pseudo corporations and the Templar orders a pseudo-bank. Corporations allow for a united front against competition, taxes, and a sharing of profits. The Merchant Adventurers of York (founded in 1357) are another example of a union of merchants. 

Anything that corresponds to the process by which businesses or other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale. See the Oxford dictionary definition. 

From what I have read, the level and intensity of training influences this massively. More green troops will break easily whereas veterans will tend to fight longer and harder. Panic is another factor: the more there is, the greater the chance of an army breaking. Mercenaries when not well paid, had a tendency to break or change side -- see the Thirty Years war for numerous example of that. Finally, a decisive key event: death of a general/leader, taking a position, or threatening the camp (with followers and your possessions) would do wonder to break the moral and route an enemy. 

The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815 (Allen Lane History) is an excellent book on that time period. Europe: A History Norman Davies will give you a good grounding as well and has many references to more in depth books. 

The Soviet Union did invade Poland in February 1919 â€“ March 1921 with the war aims of reconquest and spread of Communism -- which as comments have pointed out was the main reason (read: excuse) for Soviet expansion. The Soviet union's wars and assimilations of the kahnates during Lenin set a policy of conquest via politics and military might. Stalin was following and using Lenin to justify his own cult. So, I would yes that Stalin wanted indeed to revive the Russian Empire and expend it to cover the Earth.

After the Meiji restoration, Japan wanted to model itself on the western colonial powers. So, it sought an colonisation and expansionist policy as was common for Western powers of the time. By the early 20th century, colonial empires were already set and Japan had to invade other countries to expend. They chose to do that instead of remaining a small nation which could be conquered themselves. In addition, conquest of the land of Asia was always on the table -- remember the (failed) Korean invasions of 1592-1598. 

PS: I could not find any images of primary sources of scythe chariots. Those might well exists, I just have not found any. 

Even the Mongols, who killed over thirty million people in their conquests and were some of the most bloodthirsty invaders on record found it more worthwhile to set themselves up as leaders. Why would they make China a desert when they could make the Chinese build them a pleasure dome? Invasions occur in search of resources. Land is only one particular resource. People are by far the most useful resource for any ruler. Natural resources without people are useless. Consider that the Roman empire, one of the most successful conquering people, built its power not on the land that it took, but on the people it took. Killing a population upon conquest would be like dumping all the captured gold into the sea. If, say, the Romans had wiped out every person in Gaul, it would have not made them more safe. It would have made them less safe, because they wouldn't have had the people to occupy it and the vacuum would have been damn attractive to all those Germans over the Rhine. Better to create a nice, assimilated Romanized Gaulish population as a buffer between those nasty Germans and Italy. Keep in mind that the nationalist revolts of the 19th century were the result of an entirely new way of viewing the world. Before than, nationalist revolts were relatively rare. If you look at the history of the great conquering peoples (Macedonian Greeks, Romans, Mongols, etc.) you see little if any "nationalist" revolts against their rule. For most of the common people in those eras, it was just new boss, same as the old boss. Why should they care if their masters spoke German or French? They still owed the rent. 

Horses were omnipresent in Asia at the same time periods that we call the Middle Ages in European history. In the 13th century, the Mongols were riding roughshod over all of Asia, and given that they were probably the best riders in history (certainly of the time), any area they conquered (all of China, much of the Middle East and India) can be assumed to have the horse as a major component of its society. In regards to Southeast Asia, wiki states: 

(Note that there are no Kings and Queens of England anymore. The last person with that title was Queen Anne. Victoria and Elizabeth II are more properly "Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland".) Elizabeth I reigned for 45 years, and ruled during the defeat of the Spanish Armada, which marked the rise of England as the pre-eminent naval power, and also during the flowering of English letters represented by Shakespeare and others. Victoria reigned for 63 years, oversaw the zenith of the British empire, ruling over more land and people than anyone before or since. So those two aren't random people, but both among the longest reigns in English history, both at pivotal points in English history. Elizabeth II is of course the current living monarch, and so obviously popular by that token, and also the longest reigning English monarch. In contrast... Mary I reigned for a five years and was unpopular as a catholic ruler in a largely protestant nation. Mary II also reigned for only five years, and was a co-ruler with her husband William. Anne reigned for twelve years. So you have three women who are among the longest reigning monarchs in history, all who oversaw pivotal moments in English history vs. three women with short reigns, who in one case, was explicitly ejected, the other two reigned during relatively uneventful periods. So the relative popularities should not be unexpected. Or to look at it another way, Elizabeth I, Victoria and Elizabeth II represent over 160 years of English history. Mary I, Mary II and Anne represent 22 years of English history. 

You have several ways to go about it. First, a set of powerful nations will recognise and guarantee the independence up to going to war over the state. This is generally the peaceful way as everyone comes to an agreement that this is what should happen. Some countries (such as Poland) were re-made after a war and given independence again. India could be said to be in this camp as it peacefully split from the British Empire. Second, a country declares itself independent and forces the rest of the world to recognise them. This is what happened to the confederate states in the USA civil war... Or rather that is what they tried and failed to do. This is more risky since the rebels have clearly some difficulties in being legitimate. Lastly, a country can force independence and not be recognised by anyone or just a few nations. They become a rather odd entity -- as was Afghanistan under the Taliban was one such nation even though it was a country its government was not recognised by the vaste majority of countries . I am unsure of their legal status but if the country does not have friends, they are doomed. There are many international agreements and codes but there is no supreme court of law of the world. So, the legality of becoming independent is murky at best. Even international law is by agreement of countries. It is up to the club of nations signing the treaty to defend it. If they do not, then it's just ink on a page. 

The major change from the Republic to the Empire was the decision to keep for life as the head of state first Caesar then Augustus. Thus it put the top job in the hands of one man as long as that man was alive. There was no peaceful way to remove the Emperor at this point and since they controlled the army (or they would not be emperor) they had military power over the rest of society. The change from Kingdom to Republic was maybe more subtle but put two men in charge instead of one. Thus allowing for a balance of power at the top. Again, this is a break with the previous regime. In a similar way, you could say that the 4th of 5th French Republics are the "same": president, prime ministers, ministers, parliament, elections, yadda. Or that the French and English prime minister have the same function. Overall, you would not be too wrong but the devil is in the details. Thus why we refer to the Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantium Empire as different beasts even though they are all called "empires" and come from the same root. 

Note just bowmen... The quality of archers, their training, and their equipment did vary. Inexperienced bowmen would be of very little use on the battle field and could even be a hindrance to the side employing them -- friendly "fire" really is not. Bows, as anything made of wood, is sensitive to the weather. Scotland is well known for their rains, cold winds and general miserable weather. It is possible (although I have no real references) that leading to the battle of Bannockburn, the weather was so bad that the bows were of little use. As is true of many battles, the morale of the troupes, their training and supplies did play a major role. However, I am no expert in those particular battles so could be wrong.
