I don't usually care too much about making a pee stop if I'm hiking (I just don't mind). In the last couple of years, however, I've taken on running and have since ran a marathon and a handful of half-marathons (and a one-minute pee break is a lot when you're trying to beat your own record). Pro-advice for hydration usually falls under two big categories: 

You should run There's a good video from MinutePhysics that explains it all: $URL$ The short(er) version is that the amount of water you "run into" depends only on the distance, which is equal whether you run or walk. But the water falling on top of your head depends on how long you stay in the rain, and you can minimize it by running faster. Also, like Ben Crowell said, the usual motivation for staying dry is to maintain our body temperature. In which case, running is also a better choice since we generate more body heat. 

Pull it tight, and you now have a girth hitch with a figure-8 backup that is a long way back up the rope from the girth hitch. 

To untie, reverse the steps, moving the figure-8 up the rope until you can loosed the girth hitch enough to be able to step through the bight and pass it up your back and over your head. 

Take a bight from the middle of the rope, and tie a figure-8 about a metre from its end. Feed the bight through your tie-in loops from the bottom up to the top. 

The first one is pretty obvious, but the other two deserve a few words. Once the first healing phase is over, what you're trying to accomplish with therapy is to avoid the injury if you happen to have another accident. Strength and flexibility play a huge role in being able to sustain another fall without injuring yourself. And here's the rub: Your ankle may be stronger and more flexible than before you had your accident. You may be less susceptible to injury. I have since had a couple of episodes where the stress to my ankle have been bigger than the time I got sprained. I'm not a therapist, so I can only assume that YMMV. But for me, knowing that my ankles are more resilient than before helped me overcome my fear. 

In order to undo the knot, work backwards through these steps, feeding slack through the nipping turn to enlarge the bowline loop, and then pulling the collar out until you can step through it and pass it up your back and over your head. 

Take a bight from the middle of the rope. Make a doubled turn about a metre from the end of the bight, with the standing end on the bottom of the turn. Feed the bight down through the tie-in loops from top to bottom. (Note: It is essential to get these two directions correct.) 

And that's good advice to stay hydrated, but offers little insight into optimizing urination stops. My races so far have taught me quite a bit about how my hydration works. I stress that it's my hydration because I've seen that it works differently for different people, so YMMV. Nonetheless, these are a few tips that may work for you. Many of these tips are often recommended by some professional trainers and long-time athletes: 

Several years ago I sprained my ankle. I was lead-climbing a route that was a bit over my technical skills. I was in an overhanging segment above and sideways to my last bolt. I fell, swung, got tangled with the belay rope, started spinning, and hit my foot against the rock. I stopped climbing and started recovery. At this point I became careful about all my physical activities. A month later I embarrassingly fell on even floor in a supermarket and hurt my ankle further. At this point I became a bit fearful. Six months later while trekking I stepped on a loose rock, fell, and hurt myself even further. At this point I became panicked and maybe close to depressed. 

Feed the rope between the girth hitch and figure-8 through the figure 8 to bring the two knots close together. Pull the figure-8 snug, and you now have a girth hitch neatly backed up with a figure-8. 

Bring the bight all the way down your back, and then step through it so it is hanging in front of you. 

The easiest way is to tie a fixed loop in the middle of the rope (figure 8, alpine butterfly, bowline on a bight, etc) and then clip the climber in to that loop using two locking carabiners. Two carabiners are used here in order to avoid the scenario of a single carabiner rotating into a cross-loaded orientation during a fall and failing as a result. However, my preferred method is to tie in directly to the rope, with no additional carabiners, using a bowline on a bight. This can be achieved by tied the knot using a long bight that can be passed over the climber's entire body instead of just being passed over the rest of the knot. This gives you a bowline on a bight tie-in with a very large loop, which you can feed back through the knot to reduce the size of the loop before climbing. You then need to expand the loop afterwards before untying. Those who don't know how to tie or visually inspect and verify a bowline on a bight should not attempt this, as incorrectly tying the knot can easily result in a knot (or lack thereof) that is of inadequate security or even completely insecure. Another method for those more familiar with the figure-8 is to tie a figure 8 loop in a bight, just in the rope, not yet attached to the climber, making the loop large enough to fit over the climber's entire body. Then tie this into the climber's harness using a cow hitch (AKA lark's foot or girth hitch), by passing the figure-8 loop though the tie-in loops and then over the climber's whole body. This gives you a cow hitch tie in (which alone is insecure) backed up with a figure-8. The backup 8 will initially be way to far down the rope, due to its loop initially having been tied large enough to fit over the climber's body, but you can easily feed rope through to snug the figure 8 down against the cow hitch. As with the bowline version, you need to feed rope back through the knot to expand it before you can untie. Edit: Images, as requested. Bowline on a bight: Incorrectly tying this knot can result in a knot that is inadequate or even completely insecure. Do not attempt this if you do not already know how to verify a complete bowline on a bight. 

Granted... mountaineering is not really my thing, but I'm still curious: Why would belay devices like the Verso and Reverso useless in this scenario? 

I usually do sport-climbing so I've never owned a static rope. However, most rope-related Q&As in TGO.SE don't bother specifying dynamic vs static ropes. I've been told that for rappelling (or even canyoneering) it's not only pretty common, but actually advised to avoid elongation when you're not expecting it. On the other hand I know you should avoid at all costs using a static rope when climbing. But other than that, when is the use of a static rope recommended? 

Pull the bight through the knot until it tightens and forms the collar of a bowline, resulting in an bowline with an excessively large loop. 

Anecdotal, but this did happen to a climbing partner of mine while they were climbing with someone else. The climber yelled "Take!" while out of sight of the belayer, and heard a reply "OK, you're off belay!" He immediately clipped in directly to the nearest piece of (trad) gear, and, still holding on to the rock, got a second piece in as a backup, also clipped directly to his harness, and then screamed at the belayer to put him back on belay. Using a clearer instruction than "Safe" is a good start, but not really sufficient, as regardless of what the climber intends to say when they reach the belay/anchor, a belayer could still mishear a climber's call of "Take" as "Safe". I'd suggest it is more important that the belayer always asks for confirmation before taking a climber off belay. E.g. 

I relied on being well informed to overcome my fear. Specifically, I did my best to understand what physical therapy could do for me. A good therapy will: 

Years ago, after a storm, I found a dead bird with an id ring on its leg. I wanted to find out where to report it, but before I returned with a camera to take a photo, a neighbor decided to dispose the body. In case I ever find another one, I'd like to know how to find out what I can do. The above incident happened in Mexico, but I'd like to have answers that aren't country specific, if possible.
