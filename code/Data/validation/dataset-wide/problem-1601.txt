Yes, they are. The Indian Licence Agreement for Provision of Cellular Mobile Telephone Service states in section 42.1: 

The political parties (R, SV, Ap, ..., H, FrP, Andre = others) are roughly arranged from left to right in the same order you would arrange them on a political left/right wing scale. If we first take a look at the most leftish and rightish parties, your claim first seem to be backed up by the statistics. At the far-left, we find The Red Party (R) and the Socialist Left Party (SV) with a much higher support among the better educated voters (0/1/2% and 4/5/12% for the three education level groups). At the far right, we find the Progress Party (FrP) with a much higher support among the less educated voters (31/26/9%). If we however look at the two larger "traditional" left/right wing parties in Norway, the Labour Party (Ap) and the Conservative Party (H), the distribution is opposite (46/35/32% for the Labour Party and 7/17/27% for the Conservative Party). The last three parties, the Liberal Party (V), the Christian Democratic Party (KrF) and the Centre Party (Sp) are usually categorized as centrist parties without any clear left/right wing classification. If we group the parties as well in left wing (R, SV, Ap), centrist (V, KrF, Sp) and right wing (H, FrP), the support cross-referenced with the education level group adds up to 50/41/46% (left wing), 11/16/18% (centrist) and 38/43/36% (right wing). Even if these numbers indicate a slight skew in one or another direction, they can at least not be used to backup your original claim. If at all, they seem to indicate the well-educated people tend to prefer centrist parties. 

NB 6000 cal BP is 4000 cal BCE. "BP" means "Before Present". "cal" indicates that the years are calibrated radiocarbon dates. 

"Peak Wind" is a myth: there is nothing similar in wind to how hydrocarbon stocks will get to such a depletion point that annual production will decline inexorably thereafter. The modelling methodology smackdown - Have previous estimates over-estimated the global onshore wind resource? This is currently unanswerable. There are two conflicting modelling methods - the aggregated micro-scale; and the meso-scale. The meso-scale modelling in this new Adams & Keith paper (and in the other related papers by Lee & Keith, and the Lee & Kleidon paper in Davephd's answer) cannot yet be validated, because there is insufficient information about the performance of wind farms greater than 100km2 in area - we haven't built them yet. Until we have real-world data on very large wind farms, we cannot say which modelling method is more accurate. Does it matter? No, it doesn't. There is a wide range of different estimates of global onshore wind resource, that are derived using different modelling methods. They all agree that the global onshore wind resource way exceeds global electricity demand, many times over. And in the absence of validation of meso-scale modelling, it will not get used for wind-farm design, which will continue to use micro-scale modelling. 

First of all, Google can find quite a lot of background on the dispute between Steve Lipsky and Range Resources Corp. This article is a summary of the situation, where Range Resources Corp. has been drilling for gas close to Lipsky's estate, after which Lipsky is blaming the company for ruining a well, from which he used to get his fresh water supply. It is perhaps also worth to note that Lipsky has been convicted for being 'part of a "conspiracy to defame" the company because he'd circulated a video "calculated to alarm the public into believing the water was burning."'. Assuming that the verdict was correct, Lipsky has previously distributed videos with fraudulent claims about the water from his well burning. The news article I linked to, mentions methane contamination as the reason for the burning water, which is consistent with the fact that Range has been drilling for natural gas nearby. Methane is indeed a highly inflammable gas (mixed with air, the methane content must exceed appr 5% for the mix to be inflammable) and it seriously contributes to the greenhouse effect, but except for that, it is pretty harmless with no known toxic effects (material data safety sheet). There are even relatively high levels of methane in the humane digestion tract. According to this study, the average flatus (fart) has a methane content of about 7%. Now, methane is barely soluble in water, according to Wikipedia, only 22.7mg/l. If you look closely at the video from 0:20 to 0:30, there is also no obvious proof that the water is actually burning. To me, it looks as if a gas escaping the water pipe is burning at the opening. If the water had actually been burning, why wouldn't the water jet burn further away from the pipe opening as well? So to answer your questions: Is it safe to drink water, which can be set on fire? In this case, there is no sign that the water is actually burning. If whatever burns at the pipe opening is methane gas, it is in no way harmful to drink water having been in contact with methane gas or with small amounts of methane disolved. Is it for ordinary home purposes safe to use water, which can be set on fire? Still doubting that the water is actually burning, what may be a problem is that methane is released in closed rooms through a water pipe network. Even here, small levels are uncritical, but depending on how fast methane is released and how fast the air in the room is replaced, there may of course be a risk, that explosive levels of methane are reached. 

Yes, the Cretaceous was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide was significantly higher than it is today, (and this, of course, depends to a degree on what you interpret by significantly higher) It's very hard to be definite, because the error-bars on the estimates become large, as we look back in time. However, as the first graph below, which aggregates the results of several studies, shows, the last time it was significantly higher what it is today, was around the Cretaceous period, denoted by K. As far as we can tell, current levels are higher than they've been for 15 million years. Now "significantly higher" isn't very specific. Current levels are around 390ppm, up from around 280ppm before the industrial age started. So what's significantly higher? Let's say 800-1000ppm would be significantly higher (2-2.5 times current levels), and as far as we can tell, the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations were that high, was indeed the Cretaceous period (which ended 65 million years ago). (note that the present day is on the left in this graph). 

It is however perhaps worth noticing that the question is slightly misleading. The encryption used elsewhere in GSM and other mobile networks only applies to the radio interface between the mobile phone and the cell tower. Within the network, phone calls are generally not encrypted anywhere and in most countries, phone network operators are obligated to provide law agencies interfaces to intercept phone calls. 

The article refers to the northbound Zhuozhou Toll Gate at the G4 motorway just south of the Beijing city boundary. As you can see on the aerial photography from Google Maps, at this location, the G4 motorway has 8 lanes (4 in each direction): $URL$ 

The calculation you're linking to assumes 20,000 hours of work during residency. According to Wikipedia's section on residency in the United States, the residency usually lasts for one year (state dependent) and the number of working hours is limited to 80 per week. That makes a maximum of 4,160 hours, which is not even close to the number used in the claim. 

Skeptical Science analysis of the paper Initial thoughts on the Watts et al draft A cooling bias due to MMTs? Menne et al 2009 Quayle et al 1991 "When I had done my own initial assessment of this a few years ago, I had used TOBS versions and am annoyed with myself for not properly considering this factor. I should have noticed it immediately. That will teach me to keep to my practices of not rushing. Anyway, now that I’m drawn into this, I’ll have carry out the TOBS analysis, which I’ll do in the next few days " from McIntyre's blog McIntyre claimed to have reproduced a hockey stick from red noise. However, what he did was generate 10,000 sets of red noise, and then filter down to just the 100 of these that most resembled a hockey-stick, for his paper. 7a 7b 7c 7d 

Here's an example of a provisional figure being increased: from the New York State 2013 Highway Safety Annual Report, page iii 

What you see in the video is the АЛСН (автоматическая локомотивная сигнализация непрерывного действия) signal, a system for automatic train control used in the ex-Soviet states. Due to the low signalling speed, you can even read the signal from the pulsating bulb, which is here "code Z" (three long pulses separated by short breaks) basically telling a train on the track that the next signal will be green. Drawing any current from the rails (as done in the video) is very likely to disturb the reception of the signal in nearby trains. A lack of signal on the rails is interpreted by the running stock as if the next signal is "red" and would force nearby trains to stop. 

The average global land temperature has indeed been relatively stable for the last 10 years or so, but I cannot explain how the journalist claims this to be true for the period 1997 to 2003/2004. Perhaps if you play enough with the smoothing algorithm and the confidence intervals, you might be able to get similar results. The numbers from the Hadley Centre are relatively consistent with other regularly published data sets, e.g. the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis from NASA. 

Let's look at those two, within the context of the EU ETS, the cap & trade scheme under discussion. From Edie Energy, reporting on the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee: 

The evidence is a combination of analysis of: isotopes in diets, dental caries, and pollen. The paper sets out theories which have different timelines for the farming of crops, but those differing theories are mutually consistent in referring to some crop-growing going on before 1500 BCE: cultivation of crops seems to have been introduced around 4000 BCE. Here's the relevant part of figure 2 from that paper (data about wild foraged food cropped off from the top): 

However, various bodies have come to the conclusion that LNT is the right model to use, including UNSCEAR, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the effects of Ionizing Radiations, and the US Environmental Protection Agency, which found: 

No, Saudi Arabia has not announced plans for a women-only city. The Guardian article only says that all the workers in the cities will be women. Not all the residents. And that's based on a misreading of the original press-release, which makes it clear that there will be opportunities for female and male entrepreneurs, female and male employees, and female and male residents. The original press release from MODON, the Saudi Industrial Property Authority, that the news outlets based their articles on, says (my emphasis): 

No, he ist not the best paid Post CEO. Frank Appel the CEO of Deutsche Post AG (German Post) has a salary of 5.2 million Euro, which when considering the current exchange rate fluctuations within the last year is somewhere between AUD 7.2 and 8.3 million. Source: Berliner Zeitung 

Yes, most pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone produced by fertilized eggs, but also by some kinds of cancer cells. You can read more about different tumor markers on this info page from "The American Cancer Society". There are also several other situations where a pregnancy test may give a false positive result (both for men and non-pregnant women). The Wikipedia article lists several possibilities: 

The answer to the question in the title is no. The article is not completely nonsense, but probably a very creative interpretation of the data the journalist is trying to analyze. All data sets from the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre (which the Daily Mail article refers to) are available here. The data set with deviations in the global average land temperature sets 0 to the average temperate in the years 1961 through 1990. The smoothed average deviations for the years after 1990 are as follows (source): 

No, it should not be convincing to anyone who cares about using data meaningfully and scientifically. Raw ambient temperature data is seldom useful in and of itself. Particularly when: 

Does it matter for (inter-)national policy? There are no implications for (inter-)national policy. Earlier estimates are of a global wind resource at least an order of magnitude greater than global electricity demand, so a quartering of that resource (as Adams & Keith predict) still results in potential global onshore wind production exceeding global electricity demand. That is to say. there is still no meaningful limit on the onshore wind resource. And that's ignoring the massive potential in the offshore wind resource. 

As yet, we have very few windfarms larger than that, so this remain a theoretical exercise. There are plans to build windfarms substantially bigger than that over the next 10 years, so we will find out soon enough. 

Yes, there is a net environmental benefit from photovoltaic panels. It would be possible to contrive a corner case where there was not a net benefit (for example, having a PV system illuminated only by a light bulb, rather than by the sun); but such cases are extremely rare. Let's break down the big, somewhat cloudy question of "net environmental benefit" into some component questions that are commonly raised. Does PV have net energy production? How much greenhouse gases from fossil-fuel production does it displace, when the full product lifecycle is accounted for? How do aggregate damage costs compare? I'll deal with each of those in turn. Net energy production Fthenakis and Alsema (1) looked at the net energy production of photovoltaics, based on 2004 technology (things have improved a lot since then). They found energy payback times of between 1.0 and 2.2 years, depending on the specific panel technology, and where it was manufactured. So all energy generated after that time is net energy production. Systems typically last 15-30 years. The 2009 review of life cycle assessments by Sherwani, Usmani and Varun (3) found energy payback times of 1.5-5.7 years, for systems with lifetimes of 20-30 years. In 2012, Fthenakis (4) looked at historic trends of energy payback times [EPBT], and found that they'd been improving for 40 years (NB the vertical axis has a log scale):
