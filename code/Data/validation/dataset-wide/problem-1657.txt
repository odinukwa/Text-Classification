I've read in a few places including in comments in a recent article that Man vs. Wild is staged and he has every necessity covered. Is Man vs. Wild staged or is Bear Grylls actually in dangerous situations when we see him hanging from rocks above rapids etc.? Example comment: 

There is this research paper (extract only) which indicates smells can be picked up between humans, but there results were only better in chance between relatives: 

The actual linked source articles are well worth the read. From reading through them it appears the effect is a matter of scale and likely something that could be helped with advances in technology. It also talks about considering the benefit vs. impact. 

I was actually reading about this the other day as Boing Boing provided this excellent link to Scarleteen. It is an interview with Hanne Blank the author of Virgin: The Untouched History. 

*Unfortunately this does not state clearly what they mean by usage There are many sites out there that claim to represent a bias towards females and many sensationalist articles. Most of these are based on "various sources". One such example is this one from Cory Doctrow in 2007: 

I have done a reasonable amount of searching and was only able to find one experiment that provided solid data on what you were asking. Foreign-language experience in infancy: Effects of short-term exposure and social interaction on phonetic learning (Kuhl et al. 2003) 

The only other evidence I could find of it being possible is this passage from Darwin's "Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex": 

When I was at university (in Australia) a lecturer mentioned that the Australian standard for radio frequency radiation levels were deliberately raised to accommodate mobile phone technology. So that the previous recommended level of dosage was raised so that mobile phones could be sold. Is this true and was this done in countries other than Australia? I have found this page on the internet which seems to partially confirm his claim: 

What Parkes was aiming to do (according to Rev. Nile) was to prohibit denominational teaching as being intermingled with the secular teaching and should be taught within a dedicated period of one hour per day. 

This paper I think goes into enough detail and looks at the possibility to train cats in groups which could be used to herd cats. 

I've been doing some research on breeding rabbits and saw many people mentioning that if you inbreed rabbits (father-daughter/mother-son/sister-brother) that there is only a small chance of birth defects and a chance at an improved outcome if the stock is already good. There is another party that says inbreeding leads to serious side effects including fused spine, skeletal problems and missing or extra limbs example this video. What does the science say? I would be interested to find a range of answers if there is a difference between "first generation" of inbreeding and if it makes a difference if recurring inbreeding happens? 

This is confirmed by English-language news reports. The program was implemented in Lund in 2015, but was still being considered in the Swedish cities of Malmö, Borlänge and Örebro. There was no mention of psychological help. Rather, the idea was to provide practical measures to returning former ISIS members so that they could re-integrate into society. Over a year earlier, in January 2015, English language news reported that jihadists were already being offered psychological help and that Swedish officials in Örebro wanted to use taxpayer funds to further assist former ISIS soldiers: 

There is no transcript of the interview but I listened to it. It is difficult to hear and understand, because Jake Tapper and Stephen Miller are interrupting each other constantly, and less than a minute later, Tapper ends the interview abruptly. Starting at about the 8 minute mark of this highly contentious 12 minute interview, Miller says, 

The most authoritative study cited by the CoE website, Overview of the Nature and Extent of Child Sexual Abuse in Europe (2010) (full text, uploaded by the authors, Kevin Lalor & Rosaleen McElvaney) reported prevalence rates of child sexual abuse with very wide variation bands, and significant differences by gender and by European country. 

The summary-level definition of childhood sexual violence provided by the CoE is the following (via Is it really ONE in FIVE?): 

This myth may or may not have originated from Scientology in the early 1970s, but Scientology certainly perpetuated it. Carnegie Mellon University has an entire website devoted to L. Ron Hubbard's junk science, with a section about the pseudoscience of sweating out toxins. 

In some cases, the communities affected are immigrant communities. So in other words, both non-immigrant and legal immigrant communities are besieged by MS-13 criminals (who are illegal immigrants). Note too that MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, was named a transnational criminal organization five years ago, and its origins go back twenty years, long before Trump or his immediate predecessors were in office.

No, the CIA did not secretly fund abstract artists to draw attention away from Social Realism. In fact, the CIA secretly funded abstract artists to contrast the difference between American and western European abstract expressionism and Socialist Realism. Social Realism is characterized by: 

The same myth is cited for heroin and occasionally caffeine, that "sweating out the toxins" will make the withdrawal process easier. Your body naturally metabolizes these substances just fine. It is the absence of having them in your body, when you are accustomed to having a constant blood level, that causes discomfort. The process of withdrawal and recovery can't be accelerated by using a sauna, or by sweating: 

Article 22 provides clarity on "Corruption of children" which is definitely a form of sexual abuse and not merely something subjective such as changing an infant's diaper in public: 

I found this clinical trial paper published in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine 41:799–809 (2009) which details results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial of non-invasive body slimming ZERONA. Study Design/Patients and Methods: 

Is their any truth behind the claim made in May that detective shows, spy thrillers or dramas about time-travel are off air for the next three months? When the time travel claim first came out I investigated it. One of the original articles from April 8 in BoingBoing links to the SARFT statement. As I read by comments of some Chinese students the SARFT doesn't mention anything of a ban and doesn't even specifically mention time travel. So it would appear that the media is making this up based upon spurious claims. Here is a cut down version of what is being said in SARFT statement (translation mine and paraphrased): 

Many news stories and plenty of ensuing comments about geishas have people making a strong point that geishas are not prostitutes. However, the wikipedia article makes a meal out of the topic and makes various claims. From the past: 

That being said there are studies that confirm the benefits of wearing a face mask and the maths speaks for itself, even a 10% improvement is better than no protection at all right? There are two studies worth mentioning this study: 

Now how influential is the porn industry and is it big enough to have influenced the choice of VHS over BETA? Wikipedia quotes this book as saying: 

Although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to show that the door close button works in some modern elevators (including the one in our office building). Here is a link to a KONE elevator information brochure which states: 

Yon Doo Ough, Russell Albert, David D. Bhaskar, G. Thomas Jones and KeriLynn Loftus. The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. July 2008, 14(6): 618-618. doi:10.1089/acm.2007.0819. This is a brief trial on 11 patients with severe menstrual cramps aged 21 - 48 years using crushed soap with application via a patch and reported a positive result. The number of patients is quite limited and it was not a double blind study. Yon Doo Ough went on to perform a further study after these positive results on 83 patients with Fibromyalgia. 

Firstly, I want to point out that the original passage being debated is actually in Matthew and not in Luke as your second link suggests. Their argument is around the translation of the Hebrew word alma. They are taking issue with the fact that when the New Testament was written the Greek word for "virgin" was chosen. It doesn't say elsewhere in Matthew that Mary was a virgin, but it does call Mary a virgin parthenos in Luke 1:27 (see Greek translation here) when not linking to any past text. So, Isiah's prophecy aside, the Bible still says Mary is a virgin. So the people who are trying to make the argument are cherry picking. 

The remaining Articles cover everything else: child prostitution, child pornography, participation of a child in pornographic performances, and solicitation of children for sexual purposes (e.g. through the Internet, SMS and so forth). Issue 3 mentioned above is relevant due to recently changing demographics (especially due to migration to Europe as a result of EU policy changes from 2015 onward) and the impact on attitudes about consent, including children. It is a moot point though, if we cannot establish whether the "one in five" statistic was an evidence-based finding as of 2007-2010. In other words, we can't determine if the prevalence is increasing over time without a benchmark to confirm that 1 in 5 is accurate, an under-estimate, or an (unlikely but possible) over-estimate. Based on this document, 1 in 5 Fact Argumentation [PDF] published by CoE, it appears that the "one in five" statistic was intended as a starting point, to begin collecting data, rather than as a final result, emphasis mine: 

What is the definition used by the Council of Europe (CoE), in determining whether a child is a victim of sexual violence? Is "child victim of sexual violence" synonymous with criminal sexual abuse of children, i.e. is consensual sexual activity between two 16 year old's counted as a form of sexual violence and abuse if the legal age of adulthood is 18? Is the prevalence of such abuse stationary over time, especially as demographics in Europe have changed? Specifically, the most recent study referenced by the CoE website was published in 2010 and others dated back to 2003. 

Articles 18 to 23 are very specific. Part 3 of Article 18 explicitly states that consensual sexual activities between minors is not sexual abuse, thus resolving potential false positive data for the situation in issue 2 (note that "Party" refers to each European nation state that is a signatory): 

The reason one feels physical addiction is because one is physically addicted to a substance, which is not a "toxin". For coffee drinkers, the substance is caffeine, which occurs naturally in coffee beans. For heroin addicts, the substance is the opium derivative that occurs naturally in opium poppies (or is synthesized chemically to resemble opium, but close enough). For cigarette smokers, the substance is nicotine which occurs naturally in tobacco leaves. When denied the substance that one is addicted to, one may feel some amount of physical withdrawal. There's nothing that a regular smoker needs to do, e.g. using a sauna, to rid the body of nicotine. Stop smoking cigarettes, and the nicotine is quickly metabolized out of your body. That's when you experience some physical discomfort, such as crankiness, maybe shakiness and increased appetite. You'll feel cravings for nicotine, which will eventually go away if you don't smoke cigarettes. Using a sauna doesn't make the process of withdrawing quicker:
