I believe Benjamin Isaac's interpretation of the quote as racism is horse manure. The quote itself, as presented in your OP, is clearly an argument that the climate and laws prevalent in Asia at the time make for a cowardly and torpid culture, not the race of those individuals. This is bolstered by this point made with vigour by the author (my emphasis): 

I can find no evidence of mechanized infantry divisions in the U.S. order of battle for World War two. This is what I expected. Armoured personnel carriers were new and expensive throughout World War Two, and for all nations their use was generally limited to the (third) infantry regiment of armoured divisions, and to the reconnaissance and heavy weapons support platoons and companies of other divisions. The U.S. Army officially designated just five divisions as motorized infantry in World War Two, and only for the period 1942-3 (The 5th was a phantom, part of USFAG for the D-Day deception): 

Even the health fiends who advocate large water consumption for humans only recommend about half a gallon per day; certainly humans can survive on half that or less. That means each horse is drinking water for 10 to 40 soldiers - simply unacceptable in a siege. All in all, no sane commander ever kept his cavalry cooped up during a siege with constricted food or water supplies, given other options. A horse's food value is simply inadequate relative to the care involved under the trying conditions of a siege. Update: According to this Canadian Government report the average carcass weight of horses slaughtered in Canada from 1994 to 2012 was about 300kg with a live-to-carcass weight conversion factor of about 55%. The Carcass Weight to Retail Weight conversion factor decreases for larger animals with 75% being typical for beef. This would mean 300kg * 75% = ~ 225 kg of usable meat per animal at best. 

In many languages, the general term for distilled spirits (whisky, brandy etc) translates in modern English to 'Water of Life'. 

I've read detailed social history on Scotland which goes back to about the 16th century, and it would seem like some of the poorest Scots of that era sometimes lived in housing which was as modest as mud / dirt huts. If I'm understanding correctly the medieval era saw a very gradual rise of the town and city, or in other words civilization, so my assumption would be that early medieval society may have been closer to tribal and very primitive. In any case, that brings me to the question of how people in early medieval Europe housed themselves, with Scotland as my case study. How did people in the current state of Scotland house themselves in the early medieval period? 

Christianity in particular arose out of the Roman period when most people were trying to figure out the nature of the universe in lieu of any scientific evidence. When Christianity was coming into being there were innumerable religious sects throughout the Roman world, all competing with each other. By chance Christianity was the sect that grew, but the reason people believed in it was because it was an answer. In the modern world educated people take scientific knowledge for granted, in the ancient world this understanding did not exist, it was inconceivable. Without the ability to come to an accurate understanding people developed mythology. 

Although the first patent for an electric iron was awarded in 1882, their heating element remained very fragile, in need of regular replacement, until Thomas E. Morford thought of (and won a patent for) encasing the heating element in enamel in 1893. According to Concise History of Electric Irons in the United States power utilities didn't begin supplying electric power to residences during daylight hours until 1920. Prior to that wall outlets were not installed as part of standard wiring, and one had to unscrew a light bulb to screw in an appliance's light-socket adaptor. According to Early Electric Irons: 

If Lee had truly understood these lessons from a half century earlier, he would have heeded Longstreet's advice for the second day at Gettysburg: 

Ceding any other island to the Spanish would have simply disrupted the management of the Portuguese colony, when there was another alternative. The value to the Spanish of all the four islands was roughly the same, as their value lay in their proximity to the Guinea coast relative to South America or the Caribbean. Therefore the Spanish would not have had any particular preference. However, it would have been important to the Portuguese to maintain the integrity of their colony, by preferentially ceding the outermost island to the Spanish. 

I'm not clear on number one being the case, and if it is I'm not sure which played a more prominent role in drinking alcohol. Did most people drink alcohol to avoid getting sick, or were they just drunks like us? 

I'm more of a social historian than military historian, but if I understand correctly war between two factions is almost always a struggle for power. Is that the case? Are there examples of wars started for other reasons? Edit: There were some comments about the vagueness of the term power so I'm going to try to be more specific about it. By 'struggle for power', I mean: 

As far as I understand it from David Christian's 'Maps of Time', civilization is a direct function of population density. When groupings of people in any given geographic area can no longer support themselves via hunting/gathering, they need to intensify their ability to extract resources from the region, which results in agriculture, which results in a more sedentary lifestyle, which results in food surpluses, which results in civilization. So the answer to your question is likely something like: there were no populations dense enough yet to necessitate the need for robust agriculture, which would form a complex social structure, which we deem as civilization Tying it in with the ice age is something that I'm not as clear about. I wonder, though, if the diminishing of the ice age produced conditions where people could more easily thrive and see population growth, which led to the various agricultural revolutions you mention. 

First, let's remember that a knight is not just an armoured soldier on horseback; he is a knight precisely because of being in receipt of a knight's fee under knight-Service, with military (and/or financial, see scutage) obligations to his lord in exchange for possession of land, a manor, deemed sufficient to support not only the knight and his family, but also his required retinue in war. This retinue would have included several horses (At least two full-grown war horses and a riding horse each for the knight himself, his sons if old enough, and perhaps for one or two senior men-at-arms.) and men-at-arms, squires, grooms for the horses, etc. As such, by the twelfth century, a knight was a gentleman farmer, small businessman, and junior military leader all in one. This makes the twelfth century knight (when not also a baron) as much a member of the emerging middle-class as of the aristocracy. Certain assumptions are reasonable to make about the prerequisites of success in these multiple endeavours. Martial Requirements An essential skill in warfare is identifying friend from foe. In Medieval Europe this science was heraldry, and was conducted in Latin. The descriptions of arms was in Latin, as were their oft-associated mottos. Note that the art-work of a coat-of-arms is, to an extent, arbitrary; provided that it satisfies the recorded description for the arms. Survival in warfare frequently being dependent on split-second reflexes and decisions, thinking in Latin sufficiently well to recognize arms never seen before from their heraldic description is a survival skill. One can assume that, at a minimum, the knights with a tendency to survive in battle would be those with a solid (not necessarily fluent) knowledge of Latin vocabulary and grammar. Further, the language of the Royal and baronial courts was still Anglo-Norman French in the twelfth century. Fulfilling the feudal obligation of providing counsel to his liege-lord would have required fluent knowledge of the court's language, making our successful knight at least marginally trilingual in Latin, Anglo-Norman French, and the vulgar tongue(s) (be it an English, Scottish, Welsh, or Irish dialect) of his own vassals. The twelfth century is the great age of both cathedral- and castle-building; and the construction and besieging of such lies at the heart of todays Civil and Mechanical Engineering disciplines. Fundamental to both is geometry. While the advanced study of that is part of the quadrivium (of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), a basic knowledge would have been immediately beneficial to our hypothetical knight; and easily recognized as such. While the founding of Free Masonry still lies several hundred years in the future, the origins of speculative masonry lies in the admission of, paying, honourary members to masons guilds, from the middle- and upper-class, at about this time. In exchange for their contributions, these members received education in the geometric underpinnings to the mason's art and science. Campaign planning further requires a basic understanding of where one is in the world. How many days march is it to London, Rouen, Paris and Jerusalem is useful knowledge for one's liege-lord, and makes one a more competent knight counselor. Perhaps not all knights have this education, but the more successful ones are learning it. Business and Agricultural Requirements To finance his military service obligations our knight had to run a successful manor. He holds a manorial court, adjudicating cases that are not violations of the King's Peace (ie civil and non-felony cases). Adoption of three-field rotation over two-field is occurring at this time, and decisions on specific crops for each phase need to be made. Smiths and tradesmen need to be located and hired for the village arising around the manor. Budgets need to be drawn up and adhered to. All of this requires management skills, fluency in the local vulgar tongue, and sound reasoning ability. An upwardly-mobile knight does well to at least ensure that his sons have this knowledge, even if he hasn't. Medieval Education in General The trivium of grammar, rhetoric, and logic was throughout Western Europe of this time taught in Latin, its Lingua Franca. By 1100 several (residential) grammar schools have already been established for sons of the elite, a number of which have survived to the present day. It is likely that every sizeable town also possessed one or more non-residential grammar schools. Increasing supply of education presupposes a matching increase in demand, at least some of which is likely to have been from upwardly mobile knights. 

As a hobbyist in fine alcohol I'm curious of both the earliest known reference to this phrase, as well as it's likely origins, but the best I can come up with is 'likely much earlier than the Medieval period' from Wikipedia. 

This question may need some work, but I'll do my best.. I remember hearing a while back that much of the history of India occurred in isolation. Without knowing whether this is strictly true, it got me to thinking about parallel social traits that have arisen independently in different regions of the world. One of the more interesting social traits is religion. We know that religion is ever evolving, breaking into further sects and so on, and we know that most people throughout history have had a tendency to ask 'why'. So my assumption is that if you take all of the religions which exist today and trace their lineage backwards, you'll find a set of ancestors of 'religious families' which came to be independently of each other. So what I wonder is: 

I've been reading about the Warring States Period in Li Feng's 'Early China', and I don't know if I missed a passage but I can't seem to figure out why the period was so violent. I've been searching via Google but still I seem to be getting a lot of information on the dynamics of war, but not exactly why the wars happened in the first place. So a few questions about that:
