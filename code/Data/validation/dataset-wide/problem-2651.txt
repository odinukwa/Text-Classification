No, a preorder relation - aka weak preference relation - or, equivalently, a strict ordering plus an equivalence relation suffice to talk about "more" or "less". Not all such relations can be represented by a "value function" and even if they can the value function is only ordinal and such a representation is still considered qualitative even though it involves real numbers. (The term "value function" comes from normative economics, where also sometimes "utility" is used, though the later is often reserved for values undr risk; I don't know how mathematicians would call it. It 's just a function v: D→ℝ from some domain of objects D to the reals such that v(a)≥v(b) ⇔ a≽b) For quantitative method, you likely want to measure intensities of "more" and "less" directly and compare distances such measures, which under normal circumstances would correspond to a cardinal utility function. That's all a bit vague and fuzzy; a fellow mathematician who knows some measure theory could give you more details and representation theorems. Or did I misunderstand your question? 

As you've likely come across yourself, secular humanism is the most prominent atheist replacement for religious moral guidelines: 

Species existing today have a biological preference for survival, because species without this trait don't tend to survive long. This is the same reason that beneficial traits tend to spread throughout the species population while harmful traits tend to disappear. Non-preference for self (or offsprings') survival is a trait that isn't going to have much success being passed on. Early organisms likely did not have any such preference, of course, but there weren't many predatory organisms around either. Once eating each other became a bit more popular, any organisms that happened to develop the trait for self-preservation would drastically out perform those that didn't mind being eaten. So survival isn't objectively necessary, however it is a trait you're going to see in most/any species that last more than a few generations. 

Taking this nice manuscript by Kevin Klement as a basis, let us check whether (1) ☐∃x∃y(Wx & Iyx) follows from the axioms of counterpart theory. Using the translation procedure from first-order modal logic to FOL with counterpart axioms, I obtain: (2) ∀w'[Ww' → ∃x∃y(Ixw' & Iyw' & Wx & Iyx)] If I'm not mistaken, (2) does not follow from the axioms of CT and is not valid in FOL+CT. In fact, the counterpart theory axioms only assert that there is something actual. Interestingly, there is also no axiom stating that every world inhabits itself. Since I'm not a Lewis expert, I welcome others to check this answer and perhaps improve it. (It's always better to check for yourself instead of relying on others in such matters, right?) 

Republican party stances are primarily determined by the political favors their major donors demand, while paying lip service to the "conservative" portion of the U.S. population. Democratic party stances are primarily determined by the political favors their major donors demand, while attempting to maintain the facade of caring about the common good and "liberal" ideals. 

I'd say 'I think, therefore I am' isn't something we are 100% certain of. Or rather, what it entails is nebulous. The fact that I am a thinking 'being' at this instance says nothing about 1 second ago. I "remember" it, but personal recollection is hardly a solid source of evidence. I could refer to external sources for validation of myself, but there is nothing about being a thinking being that confirms that my understanding of reality actually correlates to what reality is. 'Cogito ergo sum' is just the acceptance that we have to start somewhere if we want to attempt getting an 'objective' understanding of reality. It's an agreed upon baseline, that exists mainly because to not accept it as fact means we can't really know anything. 

Mathematical definitions are useful and if at all only refer to 'mathematical reality' (in the sense of Platonism), not to the physical world. You seem to suggest about mathematics what Frege called "Pfefferkuchenarithmetik", it has been suggested before but didn't win a lot of followers. I can infer that 1+1=2 from a set of axioms I have set up, e.g. the Peano axioms. Whether that's useful or not is a highly subjective notion. I believe it is. Take the following example. I ask you for 1 dollar, and later I ask you for another dollar. Wouldn't it be useful to know that in total you'd loose two dollars, even if you decided to never give me anything? Do not forget that there are no completely perfect mathematical objects in physical reality - no points without extension, no perfectly straight lines, no triangles made of perfectly straight lines, and so on. Yet we need mathematics not just for understanding the world in the first place, but for all kind of intelligent planning where not all considered alternatives are realized. 

Alternatively, there are several books on the subject of mixing atheism and religious tradition, as well as several organizations (such as Atheists for Jesus) which support following religious traditions without belief in a deity. 

It seems some great answers have been given, but just to add something else: Regardless of whether a scientific theory is later proven to be incorrect, the data and testing that previously supported that theory are still just as correct and useful. It is just our interpretation of that data which is brought into question. I feel this is important to mention, because I have often heard people mention that science's practice of regularly tossing out previously held beliefs means that it is inconsistent and untrustworthy. If tomorrow, the theory of gravity was proven to not be accurate in describing some newly discovered phenomenon, that does not make it any less accurate at describing the things it used to. It is no longer an all encompassing framework that can be used, but that doesn't change the fact that 99.9% of what it states remains true. 

In welfare economics, there is a a similar position (without the naturalist presumption) about the good as opposed to the ought called the preference satisfaction view, the view that if someone chooses A over B, then he is better off with A than with B. As John Broome remarks, "... the preference-satisfaction theory is obviously false, and no one really believes it." (Broome 1999, p. 4) Perhaps something similar could be said about the above passage? Related to that, the view that preferences are revealed by choices is called revealed preferences theory in welfare economics and has also been challenged from various perspectives - e.g. based on a prior rejection of the preference satisfaction view, based on empirical phenomena (e.g. akrasia, Kahneman&Tversky's work, examples of intransitive preferences), or based on foundational value incomensurability and pluralism. Turning to values in the narrow sense, in the analytic literature on values I know of (von Wright, Hansson, Chang, Gert, Rabinowicz, ...) , values are either tied to the ought by definition according to the fitting attitude analysis of values, hence cannot be naturalized anyway, or they are characterized by their logical structure. In the latter case, there is much agreement with your points, because in order to make sense of the "producing a good feeling" analysis, more has to be said - comparative values have to be explained. And once you lay out how comparative values work in naturalistic terms, you might end up with the preference models of this tradition, thus implicitly defining values. However, at the same time it must be pointed out that the logic of "ought to" and related notions (must, permitted to, may) is not exactly the same and not directly derivable from the logic of values (i.e. essentially peference logic), or at least I'm not aware of such work. For example Hansson (2001) lays out values based on preference logic in the first part of his book and norms based on deontic logic in the second part of the book. (And deontic logics have much more problems than the modelling of preferences and values, which is fairly well-understood.) The bottomline is that there are many reasons why you are right and you can find a lot of literature on this topic within economics and philosophy, but of course at least for analytic philosophers the devil is always in the detail... 

In a word, No. Pascal's wager makes a number of assumptions which our hypothetical Strong Agnostic should question: 

2.) That the standard conventions of war should not be applied to the Taliban (who the U.S. declared war in in 2002), just because of an arbitrary political designation of "terrorist" is in play I propose that "not negotiating with terrorists" is a political tool to attack opponents more than an actual standard to govern by, and as such isn't suitable to actually adhere to. (Yeah, probably wrong area for this question. I already worked up my response so going to leave it.) 

It is possible to know a very limited set of things with absolute certainty, i.e. not dependent on basic fundamental assumptions that "could" end up being wrong. For instance, things I am absolutely certain about:
