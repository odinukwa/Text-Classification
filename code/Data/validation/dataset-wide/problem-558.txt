Just a quick suggestion. I ride mtb and after I get back into the swing of riding I learn to push the bike ahead of me more. This allows the bike to do more of the trail work. There are different styles of riding and some riders won't put to the limit of needing to dab. If you dab you lose some of your flow. 

I wouldn't imagine it is normal for them to be over-tightened - what would be the point? However, its generally advised after buying a machine built bike / wheels to check that spokes / hubs haven't loosening after a breaking in period. This in in comparison with a hand built bike. 

As long as the bike paths and roads you'll be traveling along are reasonably well cleared of deep snow, this would be no big issue. You can order basic Schwalbe Winter studded tires cheaply (around 40euro a pair) from Bike24. You should probably be able to find a basic used bike for 110 euro. Studded tires aren't strictly necessary for winter riding, but they do provide peace of mind on days with a freeze-thaw cycle. 

The guy who cycled around the world on the BBC used a "Koga Miyata Signature - custom spec alu alloy frame, 700mm wheel, Rohloff hub, disk brakes, butterfly bars" according to his web site The faster (and slightly nicer) guy used a Tout Terrain frame equipped with a Rohlhoff hub. So it seems you splash out on a Rohloff hub at least ! 

Cheaper, easy to fit, more widely available - and don't take any effort! Probably most people's memory is of the side wheel dynamo systems when they were a kid that wore away tires, put out a feeble light and turned off when you stopped. 

Cheap suspension forks can have difference attributes to more expensive ones. If you put extra oil on fork stanchion it can mix with the internal oil. If it was a more expensive fork and the performance had reduced I would suggest properly servicing them: changing the oil and seals. Cheaper forks often have elastomers that provides the damping instead of oil which wears out and means you have to replace them. 

There have been quite a few 'alternative road' bikes with wider tires being made in recent years: $URL$ While rarely used for racing, they're very competent for general road riding when fitted with wide, supple, smooth tires. Even race bikes have been moving towards wider tires and rims in recent years. 

Since your bike would just look like a bike, as opposed to a bike with a safe on it, it would be less of an unusual target to thieves. 

I've got some panniers to fix. I've bought some impact adhesive and I am working out which material to buy for the patches - will PVC ok ? or polyurethane or something else? Has to be waterproof and strong and preferable available in yellow! 

and I want to know if I can use v brakes with them. It looks like there is a thread to screw in some bosses, but I'm not 100% sure. 

Converting to a straight-up mountain bike would be hard. Converting a road bike to a 650B bike capable of handling dirt trails and gravel is a pretty established practice, mostly entailing swapping the wheelset and brakes: $URL$ It's more usually done on older frames, but nothing necessarily precludes doing it on a newish racy frame. However, a narrow chainstay/seatstay/fork gap may make fitting fat tires difficult. However, you'd be able to pick up a decent used mountain bike for the price of a decent 650b wheelset, especially if you'd be fine with a rigid bike. $125 or so can get you Tange Prestige with early 90s Deore LX and the like. If you want a project for your R300 frame rather than selling it cheap, there's always a singlespeed conversion (the Wabi wheelset is great for the price). 

I have SPDs on my commuter. Easy to clip out of, you can walk in the shoes, shoes are cheaper, you can still (just about) use the pedals with ordinary shoes in an emergency. 

On a $700 hybrid with a 9 speed chain and hydraulic brakes. Fit a new chain ($30) and new tires ($55/pair) and an LBS service for the brakes+new pads ($75) twice a year. But I'm doing 50km/day (1000km/month) 

I ran into this exact problem. In my case, it was buying 9-speed chain for an 8-speed drivetrainâ€” I didn't realize backward compatibility was an issue. 

A lot depends on the design goals for the bike. High-end road bike gear often isn't terribly durable because it's designed to minimize weight at the expense of all else. Carbon is likely to be less durable in the long run than metal, especially if the bike's used for utility purposes and regularly locked up and knocked around. A cheap fixed gear is pretty low-maintenance: in order of frequency, all you have to do is oil the chain, change the brake pads, change the tires and chain, and replace the bottom bracket and wheel bearings. After a few years, the brakes might wear through the rims. But you're giving up functionality (that you may or may not want) in exchange for less maintenance. More expensive hand-built wheels generally are stronger than cheaper machine-built wheels. 

Alternately you can measure the chain with a ruler - standard links are 1inch (25.4mm) long. Note - the chain doesn't actually stretch, the pins connecting the links wear away making the joints looser. The extra movement reduces efficiency, causes the chain to skip and will wear the rear gear teeth. 

Smaller locks are harder to break than big locks - if you know there is a rack that is thin enough to lock the frame to. Having a cable/chain as well gives you more options - a chain is harder to snip. 

Are you prioritizing longevity above all else? Because nothing's likely to beat a cheap bike of thickwalled straight-gauge chro-moly steel (which isn't particularly vulnerable to corrosion, especially if you sand and repaint, or apply rust converter to, any nicks in the paint). Lightweight, high-end tubing is more vulnerable to picking up dings, buckling in a bike accident, or, in the case of Ti, just being rubbed right through by a tire. I have a stainless steel fork that I broke an eyelet off of previously, and just irreparably bent in a minor accident. On the other hand, Sheldon Brown rode an 80-plus year old steel bike that by all appearances was pretty neglected before his purchase. 1970s Schwinn road bikes were built so that their lifetime warranty would never need to be used, and you see a ton of them soldiering on through neglected maintenance and harsh urban riding. I'd bet a simply-designed straight-gauge chromoly bike would be your best bet for something similar new. Or you can look for a vintage frame of Columbus Aelle or equivalent, or perhaps a late-80s Miyata, which were also ED-coated, and have shown their mettle by lasting 25 years already. Today's cheap aluminum bikes also likely have thickwalled tubing, and are thus probably less vulnerable to dings, and are even less vulnerable to corrosion than steel. High-end money in the bike market generally buys lighter weight or more refined aesthetics, as opposed to ultimate durability.
