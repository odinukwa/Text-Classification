You don't have to tell where you heard it, just that you heard about it and you were curious of what were the plans for you (unless, off course, he asks where you heard it). Be prepared for a change, and be ready to adapt. 

If they see employees as an investment instead of an expense, they'll probably take the extra mile to define their needs, and write a job description accordingly. IMHO, if they don't do that, and you feel they should, maybe the company's values are not in line with yours. Job hunting is a serious activity, if they're not serious about it, you should not take their offers seriously. Asking for a job description is reasonable (dude, what have I got myself into??), and if you smell something fishy, there is probably something fishy. 

The correct etiquette here is to apply for the job if it seems of interest to you and if you feel you fit the description or nearly fit the description. Your skills and your experience should be visible on your CV. If the hiring responsible find them a good fit for the job, you'll receive an answer. They'll ask further question if needed before considering you. In all case, sending a CV sounds more assertive (because you know you could do the job) than asking :) Sounding assertive is good when looking for a job. Keep in mind: they're paid to browse through CVs. You're not paid at all, so you have nothing to loose in applying. 

I recently quit from my first job out of college. I been there nearly a decade. I do miss the place and sometimes feel a bit of "emptiness" when I think back on it. I miss the people and the place a little. Then I think about why I quit there. I think about the things I do dislike and realize I made a wise choice. I think when you depart, you sort of only remember the good things. That's natural to do. I remember a lot of good things about my previous employer. But then I remember the bad things that made me want to leave and I know I made a wise choice for the better. I recall a research done. I looked up information like you did on quitting and I recall reading a research that some folks talk really, really bad about their employer and quit on those grounds. Then shortly after they realize they made a terrible mistake and the last job was actually really good. I think what these research fail to see is that people quit a job to a new job without researching the new job. They just jumped on the chance for a new job since they were angry with their current employer. I would say so long as you don't do that, you should be okay. The feeling generally goes away after a few months or so, at least for me. 

I have never been required to show the actual paper proving I have completed a degree in an interview. Now, you still should not lie on your CV, and the same should be applied to job interviews. So the advice is: be honest. On your CV you can formulate it to say that you completed all the requirements for Master X, and that you've passed all the classes in the programme for Master Y. HR and recruiters are not dumb and will notice the difference in the formulation on your CV, so, during the interview, explain the situation. Depending on the job and on the degree(s), the paper proving that you completed a master might not be important, and your application for a job could still be considered. (For instance, where I live, the title 'engineer' is ruled by laws; you must absolutely prove that you have completed an engineering degree, so you would not be allowed to have a job that would make you an engineer. On the other hand, if the job you're seeking is for a programmer job, generally, your skills will be considered, and not whether you fully completed a Master's degree.) 

The worst they can say is no. However you can predict what their answer will be based on several factors. For one, and probably most importantly, if they still have a position open. And secondly, going to largely depend on how you left the company. If you put in your two weeks, and left on good notice, then it's going to come down really to whether or not they have a position open. When you quit a job, always make sure you don't burn any bridges. That means giving them a two weeks notice, and never telling them that you dislike them or anything. However, for future employers don't tell them that you were "frustrated" with your last job. Instead, just say you left to pursue new opportunities. Remember, don't ever say anything bad about your last company. 

I honestly don't think it is relevant to list Undergrad degrees when you have a master. I would just list the masters. The part about you pursuing a phd is quite important because it would tell a employer that you plan to pursue it and potentially limit your work schedule and/or work at different hours. 

Maybe the needs of the company or the team changed between the moment they interviewed you and your first day of work. If your salary does not change, and the tasks for which you've been hired are not different from the job description, you should really bite the bullet and do your job. Don't bring this up as it will serve absolutely no purpose and make you look like you're whining. The HM has job to do, and is able to delegate management of other employees to his own staff. I don't see what is wrong with that. Maybe you could bring this up later when you've been working there for a while. 

You don't specify the the reason for leaving a job (or being laid off, or being fired) on a resume. If you're asked, you explain the situation during the interview. Otherwise, there is no need to explain it. 

That's life, and that's the workplace. It might not have been intentional, he might have reasons for it. In any case, you won't certainly change him. But keep in mind that when it'll be your turn to retire, will you do the same? You'll have the chance to pass it on the next generation ;) 

Maybe some things aren't meant to be a "learning" opportunity. Rather it is what it is and there is nothing to be "learned" from it. It sounds like your manager is telling you to take the "chillax" approach to things. So the IT department can't handle your request. That sounds great. Just tell that to whoever requested it. Just say, "Hey, I just submitted something to IT and they're saying I have to give a reason to fit the goal of the company. Here's what I said..." Then just chillax. Your part of it is done. I would say bureaucratic nonsense is hardly a "learning experience" because everywhere is different. I suppose you could "learn" something by it. First, don't expect anything immediately and think of it like oiling a really jammed up gear. Just slowly drip oil in it, and eventually it'll loosen up. Might take a long time, sure, but the most important thing is not to get frustrated by it. Just slowly keep at it, and slowly things will start moving. It sounds like your boss is cluing you in that things aren't suppose to move fast just yet so you shouldn't worry too much. He didn't say you were doing a bad job, just complaining about it too much because you want things done too soon when it isn't suppose to. 

A project manager manages projects. If the person's job is to manage projects, the company can title these persons Project Managers. You don't need a certification to manage a project. The stay-at-home-parent who plans the next family vacations manages a project. The parent-partner can call that person 'project manager'. There are certifications for project management. Some companies require their project managers to have these certifications, but it's certainly not standard. I suggest you don't make an issue out of it, until you're high enough in the hierarchy that you'd have the power to change that. Until then, don't worry about it. Other companies do that and it won't make your company look worse. 

In the Accomplishments section of your CV, write the contest name, the name of the team and the prize won as the sub-section header, and in the description, describe the task that were yours in the team for that contest: 

It's not only for the interest of the company; it's also for your best interest. Imagine that for a reason or another, you stop dating your Manager's brother. And your brother manages to convince you Manager that you've been acting badly toward him. (Let's go to the extreme and let's say he lies and tell his sister that you cheated on him.) Now she'll side with him against you. You'll be in trouble. With you not having to interact directly with that person (the Manager) at work, you're free to live your life, without fearing having your personal relationship interfere (in a good or in a bad way) with your professional life.
