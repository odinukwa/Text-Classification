There are many references about this on the web, such as Wikipedia and the NOAA site. At sunrise and sunset the angle the Sun's light makes with the Earth at those locations is low compared with angle the light makes at midday. Because of the low angle, the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere before it reaches the Earth's surface and the eyes of anyone watching either the Sun rise or the Sun set. The colour of the Sun's light is white, being composed of the colours of the light spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The wavelength of these component colours are all different. Red has the longest wavelength at 650 nm. Each of the other colours have shorter wavelengths with violet having the shortest at 400 nm. As the Sun's light passes through the atmosphere it get scattered by the air molecules and particles in the air such as dust and aerosols. Due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering the shorter wavelengths of light (greens, blues, violets) are scattered first, leaving the shorter wavelengths (yellows, oranges and reds) to travel further. The greater the amount of particles in the air, dust and aerosols, the greater the degree of scattering and the more red the sunrises and sunsets will appear. This is particularly evident after large amounts of ash have been ejected by volcanoes, after large forest fires and in locations where air pollution, particularly from industrial chimney stacks and internal combustion engines from road vehicles is a major source of airborne particulate matter such as soot or ash and other very small products of combustion 

Yes, the atmosphere is part of the Earth and as others here have stated the atmosphere thins (decreases in density) with height. The aviation and outer space communities use the Karman Line as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. This line is 100 km above sea level. 

In the northern hemisphere, air flows clockwise around high pressure systems and counter-clockwise around low pressure systems. The affect of the high pressure systems over China combined with the low pressure system to the north of Japan is to funnel cold air from the northern latitudes to the southern latitudes. This brought a significant amount of cold air to Hong Kong which caused the temperature to drop. If you look at Manila, in the Philippines, it is a relatively short distance from Hong Kong. It's temperature is 27 degrees Celsius compared to 21 for Hong Kong. If you look at the first picture, there is a low pressure system just to the west of the Philippines. With air moving counter-clockwise around low pressure systems, warm air from the equatorial regions is being drawn northwards along the western parts of the Philippines maintaining a very warm temperature in Manila. Currently, Hong Kong and Manila are being influenced by different weather system and that's why there is a significant difference in the temperatures between the two locations despite their close proximity. 

NOAA has a list of the names for the north west pacific region. At the end of the webpage, in column V of the last table you will see Talim followed by Doksuri, then Khanun. This is why you are seeing Tropical Storm Doksuri just after Tropical Storm Talim. 

The green material indicates the potential presence of copper & the shiny bits on the lower left & mid right of the specimen look metallic, but that could be just glint in the picture. Also, there are two groves on the lower right which may indicate a soft metal like copper. If it is metallic it could be native copper or it could be lump of copper from a foundry. 

Wind is largely driven by differences in atmospheric pressure. The effect of trees and forests is to force the winds to flow over the forests. The loss of leaves in forests would result in winds having a larger impact at ground level. Also, due to the change in the surface roughness to air flow because of the loss of leaves the wind would lose less of its energy. It has been suggested in this paper, though not yet fully accepted by many, that water vapour in the atmosphere due to evaporation and transpiration can contain sufficient latent heat to accelerate air and drive winds. 

The density & composition of the meteoroid would be important. There are three main types of meteoroids: 

Physicalgeography.net and the Colorado State basic hydraulic page have a good explanation of Horton's Laws. The first thing that needs to be done in analysing a drainage basin is to classify the stream segments in a basin according to Strahler's method. For each stream order tabulate: 

Soil is a collection of minerals and the color of soil is largely determined by the composition of its minerals. Protein is derived from biological sources. The only way proteins could affect the color of soil is if the soil also contained large quantities of biological material. 

As the term "carrot-shaped" suggests, the general shape of the pipes is conical and when viewed in horizontal cross-sections they are generally quasi-circular. 

A dry sea is a location where there was once a sea, but no longer exists or one where the sea only occasionally fills with water before it rapidly dries out. As the water evaporates, salt that was once dissolved in the water precipitates and deposits on what was the sea bed, now the land surface. Dry seas are larger versions of dry lakes. Sometimes dry seas form naturally and on other occasions, as with the Aral Sea, their formation is due to human interference with nature. 

By way of reference, "humidity depends on water vaporization and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature". From the information you have supplied in your comments. There are waters in Bucharest and forests in the suburbs, but no waters or forests where the country house is located. From your information, Bucharest has a number of sources of atmospheric water vapour, the river that flows through it (evaporation of water) and the forests in the suburbs (transpiration of water). Additionally, motor vehicle exhausts will increase the humidity as water vapour is one of the products of the combustion of hydrocarbons. The warmer the air, the greater its capacity to hold moisture. Cities tend to be warmer than rural areas due to the heat island effect, which is the result of modifying land surfaces and the generation of waste heat. Humidity in the rural location will arise from evaporation of water in the soil and transpiration from crops or grasses. Such transpiration will produce less water vapour than forests. Additionally, the rural location will have significantly fewer cars producing water vapour in their exhausts. Consequently, the rural location will be less humid than the city. The reason why Bucharest is more humid that the rural location has more to do with the greater availability and vaporization of water in Bucharest and the temperature of Bucharest than the amount of pollution in Bucharest.
