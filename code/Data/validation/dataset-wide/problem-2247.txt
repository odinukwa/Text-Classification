1 To make this more realistic, spread out the Retired Out, Timed Out, and Mankad Run Out between the other dismissals off legitimate deliveries instead of lumping them together before the start of the over, and add some drama. For example, one batsman picks up a fight with the fielders, which leads to aggressive arguing and swearing for a prolonged duration. The batsman then storms off and is declared Retired Out. A couple of balls later, someone is dismissed in a controversial manner, and the tension flares up again leading to more ugly scenes on the field. This spills over to the dressing room where members of the batting side (and maybe the reserve players and support staff of both teams) keep arguing loudly. Amidst the commotion, the next batsman forgets to step out and is declared Timed Out. One or two balls later, with both sides brimming with rage, a Mankad Run Out happens! You can imagine what happens next. :-) In this scenario, it is easy to imagine the Umpire miscounting the over. 

A kickoff is neither a play from scrimmage nor a fair catch kick (a fair catch kick can occur only immediately following a kick that was fair-caught). Therefore, kicking the ball through the uprights results merely in a touchback, just like kicking the ball out of any other part of the end zone would. 

By rule 5, section 13, the media timeouts take place "at the first dead ball" after the 16, 12, 8, and 4-minute marks (or 15, 10, and 5-minute marks, depending on the agreement, but this is rare). By rule 6, section 5: 

The Tour Championship, final event of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, has been held at East Lake Golf Club, Atlanta, Georgia since 2004. It currently plays as a par 72 course and the 18th hole is a long par 3: 

Bill Barnwell, then of Football Outsiders, developed a metric called Adjusted Games Lost in 2008. It attempts to assign an "injury cost" to each game missed by a player. He explains it further in a New York Times article: 

Kevin Pietersen (or any other batsman) turns the bat while playing the switch hit because it would be nearly impossible to play the shot correctly with the bent back surface of the bat. 

Note that the above rule wasn't included in the playing conditions for 2003 World Cup and earlier, so in all the above cases, the forfeiting teams conceded "only" the points for the match without affecting their net run rate. 

As per laws of the game, a team can send their batsmen to bat in any order. Why then are teams asked to submit the batting order before start of the game? See the team nomination forms tweeted by ICC ahead of the 2015 World Cup semi-final match between India and Australia. 

The last over becomes a 7-ball over due to the umpire miscounting.1 The 10th dismissal could be either (a) Hitting the Ball Twice or (b) Obstructing the Field. The answer to your other sub-question on Obstructing the Field is that it is not possible before the ball is bowled, as covered in Law 37.1: 

The disadvantage is that this formation puts most of the offense right in front of the "core" of a typical 4-3 defensive formation (4 defensive linesmen, three linebackers, two corners, two safeties). The defense can drop into "cover 6", with the outside linebackers shadowing the tight ends, zone coverage by corners and safeties, and the middle linebacker watching for the run, or they can "zone blitz" bringing all seven core defenders to stuff a run and prevent a long pass opportunity while keeping the corners and safeties in coverage. 

The number one cause of slicing, irrespective of the exact aspect of the swing that is lacking, is a "grip it and rip it" mentality to your swing. This generally causes a number of timing and posture issues that open the clubface, bring the swing out of line, etc etc. So, the number one thing to do is slow it down. You can send the ball MUCH farther than you think with a very easy swing, and an extreme windup (the kind where you end up able to see the clubhead out in front of you in your peripheral vision) will cause more problems with accuracy than it solves with distance. From a technical standpoint, slices happen when the club induces a clockwise (for a rightie) sidespin on the ball. This induces a force called Magnus lift, where the leading edge of the rotation on the left side of the ball brings the turbulent air from the back of the ball around to the front along that side as part of the ball's "boundary layer", and so causes the boundary layer on that side to be thicker. That thicker, relatively higher-pressure boundary layer pushes the ball in the opposite direction (to the right). Sidespin is induced whenever the clubhead moves in a direction other than the direction the clubhead faces. The direction of the face determines the line the ball will launch along; the difference between that line and the line of movement of the clubhead determines sidespin. For a slice, the clubhead is moving to the left of the direction it faces. Most commonly, this is because the clubhead faces right of the intended line. Here's how to diagnose and fix the most common slices, for a right-hand golfer. At the driving range bay, determine the desired line of travel, and draw a line or place a club along that line. Put your toes right up to that line (a "square stance"), address the ball as you normally do, take your normal swing (ensuring you make solid contact), and find the symptom that best describes the ball's flight: Push Slice: 

This is clearly not equal to the following expression (which is what your question is probably alluding to): 

If you touch the net while playing a shot, you lose a point. (I remember seeing Federer lose a point a few years ago, as he fell on the net after hitting a smash shot.) However, a player could stand close to the net without touching it and stretch his playing arm into the opponent's court to play a shot. This seems to offer an unfair advantage, because the net is taken out of the picture, and the player only needs to aim the ball correctly into the opponent's court. Is this allowed? 

The above expression, however, will always equal zero, because (a) the total number of runs scored equals the total number of runs conceded, and (b) the total number of balls faced equals the total number of balls bowled. However, that is not what happens when you calculate the sum of net run rates. In other sports such as football, the sum of goals scored and goals conceded by all the teams in a table will be equal, but that doesn't happen with the net run rates in cricket since there is division involved, and not just simple addition. For convenient reference, below is an actual points table as an example. It is the points table from Group 2 of the Super 10 stage of ICC World T20 2016 at the end of 25 March 2016.
