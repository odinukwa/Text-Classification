All of this clearly indicated that any piece of purported space junk bigger than the ISS would be tracked, cataloged and subject to minute analysis concerning its function and purpose. The fascist nation in preparing to drop "rods from god" on unsuspecting enemy nations couldn't be done in secret. Just launching the orbital kinetic weapon satellite would be warning enough. There is a high probability that many other nations would mobilize their antisatellite weapons in preparation to destroying it at the slightest provocation. A tungsten rod from orbit exceeds the usual bounds for slightest provocation. Expect this orbital weapon to be subject to multiple attacks from the majority of other nations with space-capacity. 

In words, matter moving backwards in time will be antimatter. Therefore, if there is a solar system where time flows backwards its matter will be antimatter. 

Yes. Black holes are gravitational bodies One gravitational body can orbit another. Black holes can orbit each other. Simple as that. 

The fastest and quickest way to evacuate a building is by the fire stairwell. Forget about all the nonsense about fancy contraptions to get people down to ground level in increasingly absurd manners. What is needed is an orderly evacuation system and fire wardens who ensure that people leave the building in an orderly manner. Fire wardens are there to make sure that mobility impaired persons either wait until the stairs are cleared before they descend or they are placed in locations where they can remain in safely until a fireman can come and evacuate them. The author of this answer was a fire warden in a seventeen story building. Orderly evacuation plans, trained fire wardens and reasonably frequent fire drills will get people out of buildings in the fastest and safest way. Forget the Rube Goldberg technological fixes. At best they're twaddle and at worst they not needed and most of them are far from safe. Oh yes, one more thing. Bah! Humbug! 

There is no need to hide the signs of previous mining, industrial, urban or technological activity on the planet. After thousands of years most of the obvious signs would have been overgrown or degraded by natural forces. The surface will look more like that of a previously inhabited planet, but not a currently inhabited one. Basically there's no reason to suspect the planet is occupied by a civilization of sapient creatures. The lack of any native inhabitants by itself will suggest the local sapients have abandoned their planet. After all, that's what they mostly did. Apart from those living deep underground in their great subplanetary city. With this set of circumstances, the human colonists will assume that the planet was inhabited in the past. Wars and runaway consumption ruined the planet. The native sapients moved to another planet elsewhere. Also, this is comfortable story that fits in with their belief they had arrived on a planet suitable for colonization. People do tend to belief what they want to believe. So when native aliens emerged from deep below this would have been a nasty shock. 

Why bother? The time travellers can only carry one percent of their body mass. After the clothes they stand up that leaves hardly anything. No gadgets to subdue empires! A complete lack of skills to cope with past conditions and a lack of the languages to deal with people in the past. The time machine will arrive randomly somewhere between one year and nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine years in the past. Ho hum! These guys aren't a threat to history, they're a threat to themselves. Consider our god syndrome time traveller landing nine years in the past, apart from babbling about what he might inaccurately remember about 2007 (this is written in 2016). Far from conquering 2007, how we remember Our Glorious leader from the Far Future of Nine Years hence those nine years ago, but if only it happened that way, instead our time traveller is likely to slammed into a detention centre and milked for his scrappy knowledge of the future. Trump for US President, indeed! A obvious lunatic. Nine thousand years in the past, what's the point of wanting to be a god if you can barely communicate with your palaeolithic ancestors and more especially if you find yourselves totally dependent on them for your food and survival. No-one is going to bother about preventing God complexes in stupid time travellers who are only going to their death in a past which they are ill-equipped to handle on a conventional, day-to-day level, let alone a history-changing one. The problem is more one of duty of care to mentally bewildered who will only kill themselves with time travel. Of all the many forms of time travel this is one that is singularly useless for any possibility of changing the past and manipulating history. 

There is one effect that is derived directly from special relativity. It is remarkably surprising no-one has noticed it. This is based on the fact that the speed of light will always be constant in all frames of reference. If time inside the 'quick-time' bubble is passing 100,00 times than in the outside world, and since the speed of light must be constant inside the bubble, then lengths in the bubble must increase by a factor of 100,000. This is the inverse of the Lorentz-FitzGerald length contraction. Effectively this is a length expansion. For example, if the 'quick-time' bubble has a diameter of two metres in its frame of reference, then due to length expansion its size will have expanded out to two hundred kilometres in the frame of reference of the outside world. This suggests someone inside a 'quick-time' bubble can't sneak into art galleries and museums to steal their treasures. As, for example, in Arthur C Clarke's SF short story "All the Time in the World". Any fast-moving giant can be easily detected and just as easily stopped with a few flashlights. Of course, the Flash would have the same problem. What a pity. I rather liked the Flash as a good example of a superhero with a singleton super-power and who had to exploit it to the utmost. 

*: Their broad and wider bodies will have the downside of them looking more like Tolkienesque dwarves than Hobbits. Upon the reflection many of these genetically engineered modifications will be standard for human beings who travel in space. Even for humans who remain on planet Earth they may have been installed as standard features in normal human anatomy and physiology. The size of the brain doesn't need to be much smaller than ordinary human beings, and especially for humans who are on the smaller size spectrum of normal human variability. The shape of the skull and the brain contained within it, can be flattened down to accommodate a normal sized brain. There is no reason to expect the colonial Hobbits to be less smarter than your average human being. 

One of the limits in reducing the size of circuits and transistors on a microchip was the inherent radioactivity of the materials composing the microchip itself. Now this level of radioactivity is simply the background radiation. It does allow for computing certainly up to levels more than comparable with current levels. Assume a world where background radiation levels are significantly higher than those in our world and large-scale integrated solid state circuitry could be effectively impossible. Since this is part of a science-fiction society hundreds of years in the future, then the increased radioactivity could come numerous sources. The widespread use of nuclear power, nuclear wars, and possibly the necessity to use nuclear pulse propulsion spacecraft, launched from the Earth's surface, for interplanetary travel. Since space itself is a high-radiation environment the computers used there will be more primitive and more robust than current computers. They could quite easily be the equivalent of 1970s computers. The use of these simpler computers will be more sophisticated and subtle than how computers were used in the actual 1970s. Software engineering will have progressed and programmers will know how to get the most out of 'simple' software applications. Just like they did in the old days, i.e., the 1970s when good programming involved the least number of instructions and clever thinking about how to make it work well and efficiently.
