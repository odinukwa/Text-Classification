You can fit the lever shifters to your bar (duh..) You can brake effectively with the available pull: from a quick image search it seems that Miyata1000s do mount cantilever brakes, which require a relatively long pull distance. You should first of all true your wheel (I haven't had time to watch the whole thing with audio but the guy seems to be using a method I personally found to be very effective). You may then proceed to adjust the cable tension by shortening the cantilever "beam" so that your brake pads rest as close as possible to the wheel, in order to reduce the required pull to a minimum. You should then be able to clamp the rim hard even with a relatively short pull lever. 

Possible cause: Without any further knowledge about your bike, I'd guess that the clicking noise has something to make with a grease in either the pedal or the crank bearings. (As you mentioned that the sound occurs only when the pedals are in the very same position and when you actually put some force on them, I'd say it isn't caused by something like an unevenly tightend handle bar or loose seat post etc etc..) Since you only hear the clicks within the first 5 - 10 min when riding, I assume this is the time the grease needs to "warm up", as in become slightly more fluid due to the friction it experiences. During this time some of the little balls inside the bearings could cause the clicking noises. Possible solution: 

It obviously depends on what you plan to do with your bike, but provided you're willing to get your hands dirty the answer is a definite Yes. I have been riding my modified Tdf-100 (9-speed SORA with 7speed MTB cassette) for 10.000+ km, and I'd feel pretty confident saying that with a little bit of patience and careful indexing you'll have a perfectly functional bike, although maybe not competition worthy due to slightly sub-optimal shifting reliability and braking power. That said, as most of the other answers point out, you have to make sure of the following key points before you even start: 

You will then have to work around the mismatched lever/cassette indexing. There are two main aspects to consider: 

A quick google research lead me to this article about comparisons of Campy and Shimano cables: Campy / Shimano Cable Comparison: 

fear / the size of your balls: right after the hardware, i'd say the software (as in your brains) determine a safe downhill speed. the road: not gonna go to details here, that has been discussed in may ways in the comments. summing up: if your bike is properly set up and well maintained, i don't assume it would just fall apart when going fast. 

Since I ride throughout the year, I want to fit some mud guards to it. I've looked a lot of places, whether in bike shops around town or online (i.e. SKS). So far I haven't found anything for 650c wheels... Another tricky issue is the lack of threads for fixing the bars. So ideally the guard should be fixable like this Crud Roadracer Guard Set. And of corse, the frame being built for triathlons, the geometry is rather tight so there isn't a load of space between frame and wheels... I know it's a tricky question but I'm curious about any suggestions or tipps regarding a pair of mudguards. 

It is important to clean and lubricate the entire drivetrain, as you'll be striving to adhere to the First Law: Ye Shall Make No Sound as you make your adjustments. Proceed as follows: 

By trial and error you should be able to get to the stage where the centre sprocket and the closest four work smoothly with minimum racketing. The deviation between clicks and sprockets for the highest and lowest gear might be large enough for them to require TWO clicks (or a full lever swing) to get to, hence the need to allow a little extra slack on the maximum limiting screw (so that you may reach the click with the lever, then let the derailleur settle in position by clicking down once). Extra trick: If and only if you're really not satisfied with the results of the above procedure, you can index your centre sprocket (Step 3) one click up, and have a "ghost gear" click below the hardest to release enough cable to reach the smallest sprocket. The low limit screw should then be as tight to the perfectly aligned position as you can get it. This will allow you a bit more room for manoeuvre but can get quite complicated since you won't be able to rely on the small-sprocket=cable-fully-extended equation. It may all be a bit awkward at first if you're used to perfectly indexed gears but I take if you were that picky you wouldn't even be asking this in the first place. You'll get to know your ride and the way it shifts, and the half-pull and two-up-one-down will become second nature soon enough. I hope this makes sense, I may have assumed prior knowledge in an attempt to keep it linear. Please comment if you need clarifications. Enjoy the hacking! 

I recently go my hands on a nice clean Titanium triathon frame. Together with my mechanic of trust I built up a sleek and fast city bike, using 650c wheels. 

I never wash any of my bikes with water. Water, specially at high pressure out of a hose may get to places it shouldn't (i.e. bearings) and thus reduces the life expectancy of your bike. Personally, I don't have a lot of space inside, and this works perfectly fine: 

Essentially, Campy cable ends are smaller than Shimano / SRAM systems. As other users already suggested: Buying decent quality cables is a good investment. It makes shifting gears a lot more precise and thus fun. Personally I'd recommend the Jagwire Road Cable Sets - they're not the cheapest, but since you already bought yourself some nice Campy parts, do them a favour and wire them with a nice set of cables. 

Set your limit screws with no cable on (push and pull the derailleur by hand) so that both limit positions are about 1mm wide of the corresponding sprockets (i.e. left of the large one and right of the small one). Put the lever in hardest gear thus releasing all cable, pre-tension it and clamp it into the derailleur. If you can index your gears normally from here then RIGHT ON, skip the rest of this boring answer, sit back and enjoy this blissful moment of the-universe-sorting-itself-out-for-your-happiness. Otherwise.. Index your preferred chain position: you can choose the perfect chain line (or maybe the sprocket you think you'll be riding on the most?). The more different the spacing is from the lever clicks, the more important that you choose a mid-range sprocket as your indexing centre, so as to minimise the maximum misalignment your jockey arm will have to endure. Click the lever into the desired position, and adjust the cable tensioner (or have a friend hold the derailleur in position as you unclamp the cable to make small adjustments) until the "indexing centre sprocket" turns smoothly and silently. Proceed to make small adjustments until you can smoothly shift up to softest, down to hardest, and back to your centre sprocket.
