Edit The original answer assumed a much larger catastrophe than what appears to be the case based on previous eruptions and any projected events in the future. This edited answer proposes scenarios for a situation where complete, global, ecological collapse is not presumed to be imminent. However, depending on the magnitude and duration of such an eruption, the result could possibly imply dire consequences for global ecology. For example a month long eruption of the Yellow Stone caldera would almost completely coat the North American Continent in ash. This obviously implies complete shutdown of the economy of the continent, not to mention the devastation at ground zero from the explosion and greater than 1 meter of hot ash, however the global ecological impact is less clear. Does this mean a darkening of the skies for a period of one to several months over a significant portion of the planet? In the longer term, would the released gases significantly contribute to global warming, and how much of the sky darkening would offset such effects (via shading/reflecting the sun back into space) in the short term? These question are not addressed in this answer as they delve into longer term effects and the initial conditions which lead to those effects. That said, here are some economic numbers which can help to narrow down the effects of the economic shut down of the North American Continent. For this purpose we will assume that the dominant econimic driver of North America is the United States and for simplicity we will exclude Mexico, which will be less affected by the eruption. The approximation is roughly as follows: U.S. Imports (2015) $2.76 trillion U.S. Exports (2015) $2.23 trillion source Canadian Imports (2015) $418.8 billion Canadian Exports (2015) $407.1 billion source This means that Canadian imports and exports are ~15% and ~18% of the United States respectively. Since about 75% of Canadian exports are to the United States and 50% of Canadian imports are from the United States, this means that we can subtract 75% of Canadian exports from the the U.S. imports total and 50% of Canadian imports from the U.S. exports total. This gives us the following amounts: Estimated North American Import and Export Shutdown after Super Eruption North American Imports $2.45 trillion North American Exports $2.02 trillion Now, to put this into perspective, global exports in 2014 in goods and services totalled $23.9 trillion, which means that North America represents about 10% of global exports. In 2009 the World Trade Orgainzation, in a press release, projected a 9% decline in global exports as a result of the global economic collapse of 2007-8. So this clearly links the removal of North America from the world economy to an economic down-turn, which at best would occur on the scale of the housing crisis and the effects of that. However, the issues with the economic collapse of the 2000's were financial in nature and there were no other natural or otherwise condemning circumstances to induce a deeper collapse of the world economy. In the case of catastrophic damage to North America, I would venture to speculate ( based on my virtually non-existent understanding of economics ) that a post-super-eruption world-economic collapse would be much deeper, more sustained and more vulnerable to ripples, which would be further propagated and perhaps amplified by North America's total collapse, and the combined effects of this would plunge the world into a total depression which would last several decades, perhaps half a century or more. The best comparisson we have to such a scenario is the Great Depression which lead us into [incorrect] World War I, and subsequent power shifts and struggles which re-emerged in [corrected] World War II. The Great Depression lasted about a decade from 1929 to 1941 when we entered WWII. From historical accounts, it seems that the US privately wanted a way into WWII as our leadership knew that it would help us recover from the depression and we got that opportunity when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. 

I doubt that it is likely that advanced civilization could have developed before us. There are a lot of clues that suggest why, given that science basically says "no it didn't happen", but of course there is also a lot we cannot know for certain. So I will stop just short of saying that it is not possible at all. Obviously we have no evidience that any advanced civilization or intelligent species existed on Earth other than humans. I would also suggest that if anything advanced did develop, it did not make it into space or we would have detected it already. This means also that I tend to disagree with your assumption that space objects would "go away" in a few million years. Perhaps they would, but it would be less likely for anything at a Legrange Point to go away that fast. Presumably one of the first things that are tried with satellites is positioning them at Legrange points, as this solves many complicated problems with only a little more effort and ingenuity. Considering that we have only been going into space for ~60 years or so, I think it's safe to assume that we have tapped the potential of the Legrange points fairly early on in our space faring age. So on to advanced, but less advanced than us. Firstly, mammals had an opportunity to evolve because they were small enough and successful enough in the post apocalyptic world of Earth after a massive comet impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. But are mammals the only kind of creatures that can develop high intelligence? Perhaps not. Some octopods and mollusks are quite clever. However, what creates an environment where such a species can thrive and develop culture, particularly sophisticated language? What are the advantages to such traits developing which are worth keeping? In other words when is it less important to run from predators and more important to share information? The answer would seem to be when hunting, or rather sharing the responsibility of capturing food, which benefits the group more. I am not familiar enough with mollusks and octopods to comment on their hunting ability or collaboration skills, if any, that they possess, however... Dolphins, which are mammals of course, do this, shepherding small snatches off of a bait ball, surrounding them with a tubular curtain of bubbles to confuse them and drive them toward the surface "cornering them", and then the dolphins take turns swimming up through the tube scooping up mouthfuls of fish. Quite an elaborate behavior. Wolves have similar tactics though, flanking, cornering (as in chasing toward water or tall grass to slow the prey) etcetera when hunting as a group. Another interesting option, one that was explored in The Host, by Stephenie Meyer of the Twilight books and film series, is insect brains. In that case, arachnoid or spider-like. How smart can an insect be? Interesting question. To quote an article on the matter of insect intelligence, it is put forth that honey bees exhibit very intelligent behaviors. It seems dubious to me to call these behaviors intelligent as I would more easily accept that, in such a small package, such behaviors are evolved, hard-wired abilities, however I am not a neurologist nor an entomologist. 

†By this I mean a small, perhaps pea sized region in the brain, which would be in roughly the same position in most people's brains. 

A standard fire arm should work fine. Even though vibranium absorbs kinetic energy† and vibrations, the mechanism by which a standard fire arm operates is a build up of pressure behind the projectile. The projectile can be any substance you choose and vibranium will not detract from this effect to a degree that will significantly degrade the performance of the weapon. Simply put, the Wakandan variety, simply known as vibranium: 

A standard combination lock. A standardized tumbler lock which would require a sturdier key with a handle shape with more leverage and a very hard spring to prevent the lock from being turned without such leverage. In other words if a person attempting to throw the bolt can get a telekinetic grip of the inside of the key hole, and even guess the tumbler combination, the amount of leverage needed to turn the lock would amount to requiring a pair of pliers or vice-grips ( if the lock were standard and the key were hard steel and not the kind of softer metals that standard keys are normally made of ). The way to make this lock accessible to the owner of the lock is to either exchange or add, in addition to the tumblers, a combination lock which would release the lock from the hard spring preventing it from turning effortlessly. The backup, if a person is under the weather that day for instance, would be the actual key for such a lock - like the old hoosegow butterfly key with the metal loop handle, or given that an additional combination/release mechanism is in place, just a normal key. 

But it is worth noting that insects were once very large indeed. Many millions of years ago, for which we do have a fossil record. 

See Rudy Rucker, "Post Singular" for out of control, large scale, distributed AI on the low end and functional, human-mind expansion resources on the high end. This cleanly addresses resource competition. See Cory Doctorow, "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" for fully connected society, mind uploading and regeneration. This has little to do with competition with AI but rather handles the human aspects of immortal society. See Kim Stanley Robinson, "Aurora" for the trip to another star, problems that can occur and a hopeful look at human-AI interaction. See Joan Slonczewski, "Brain Plague" for mind enhancement and an interesting take on self vs. other and the boundaries between the two regarding such enhancement. This one deals with cooperation as well as competition, not with AI, but rather surrounding biological enhancement with sentient microbes. A human-centered view, of course, but makes for a good juxtaposition with the OP story-line IMHO and may lead to interesting insights. 

As for other kinds of toys: Hasbro, makers of American culture ( as well as many, many games we all know from our childhoods ) does not seem like the kind of place that subjects its "elves" to such harsh conditions. Deemed one of the best companies to work for in 2012, this site reports a total of about 5700 employees, over 3100 of them in the United States. $URL$ reports total sales of \$19.48 billion in the United States in 2015. Hasbro figures reached \$4.45 billion in 2015, making it top 22% of the U.S. market. From there we can extrapolate some roughly 25,000 elves for the U.S. Now given that the U.S. is only about 4.4% of the global population, we can further extend the estimate to over half a million elves - which seems reasonable, but we must consider also that only about 32% of the world is Christian and I have no idea how many people outside of the U.S. believe in Santa Claus, so I must assume that the low figure of approximately 180,000 elves and a high figure of 568,000 elves gives an appropriate range, the former being how many are needed if only Christian children in the world receive toys at Christmas and the later if all children in the world are given presents made by elves. Note that the OP's figure 2+ billion children is as large as the number of people in the world who are Christian. Certainly fewer than all of those people are children, so the OP's figure must also include non-christian children. Given that, the larger end of my estimate seems reasonable. Further more, the above figures are strictly for toys. As suggested above, including video games would be an entirely different model as a single game can involve the cooperation of up to 1000 individuals and hundreds of games are released each year on various platforms and online. 

There is no amount of hand waving that could come close to glossing over how something such as your setup would work. Teleportation, and thus wormholes are merely theoretical as far as anyone knows, and they would require extremely large amounts of exotic energy (negative energy) to make them work for anything larger than things near the plank scale. No one has ever observed a wormhole. This concept may be confused with quantum teleportation, however the two, transporting matter vs transporting information, are very much different processes. Teleporting matter, anything the size of an atom or larger, would depend on the theory of Einstein-Rosen bridges, better known as wormholes, which derive from General Relativity Theory. The energies involved are so large that if we, as a species, started trying to gather and store all of our energy for that purpose, we would not be able to collect enough matter and energy to make a wormhole for a very long time into the future. Building a wormhole would require similar resources to trying to build a black hole as the two operate on a similar scale of warping space-time. I would suggest, as you have already guessed, to keep this in the realm of sci-fi and not try to explain it too much. Other commentators on this topic seem to agree as well. 

The maxim, often attributed to Einstein, but to paraphrase, "Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler", I think applies here. I would put it this way, let's say it is safe to assume that the recipient of such a message would need some form of computation in order to receive and decode the message, call it a minimum requirement. However, as one sending such a message, I would not assume that the recipient has any more than the necessary knowledge to both receive and decode such a message. If the message itself is the base-line, rather the need to send a message and have it be received is the minimum requirement, then why place any higher requirement on the recipient? Given the nature of the described content that will be transmitted, it seems that a fair portion of it may be amenable to encoding based on the nature of the Catalan Numbers themselves. Certainly anything to do with binary trees or binary operators ( such as representations of recursions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division ) would be. An perhaps other geometric proofs as well. 

I assume that the kind of faith that you are referring to is the same as the above referenced faith that is "properly understood" such that it does not contradict reason. Here is a bit of loosely autobiographical American History as related by Hunter S. Thompson to give you a sense of faith without wisdom and the danger of forging a blind path. This at a time when common folks, en masse, both embraced and began to reject self-medication for the purpose of relieving the self from the ills of society. Although, "self-medication" is clearly not new to that period, nor certainly can the 1960's era in the U.S. be placed on par with other noteworthy periods such as the Age of Enlightenment. The events of the 60's basically (merely) represent a mass rejection of the social contract, a rejection of human roles prescribed by society and a skepticism of an established order which appeared to lead to so much unhappiness - a theme which in itself, ironically, is not at odds with the founding of the established order, that of a democratic nation, however, the rejections are of the decay of human centered values, those which get lost in vying for dominance among nations. Similar themes are present, though in a different cultural context, in Japan, the suppression of self/emotion for the greater good. The roots of the rejection of the societal order go back to the beginnings of civilization, but we can see a trace of the sense of dystopia as late (in proximity to the 60's melt down) as the Marx Brothers' films. The first part below relates the myth, the belief, the intuition which goes along with attempting to heal, that finding inner peace will solve the problems which lead to the lack thereof. Afterward it is compared to the disillusionment, the breaking point, the realization and the beginning of the acceptance of loss and an inability to completely heal - the starting point of moving on with life.
