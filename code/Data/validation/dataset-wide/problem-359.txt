The book would have to be written in a language that the recipient could understand. Not just the words, but the concepts. It would need a primer, an explanation of the concepts starting with "This is a copper wire, and this is how you connect it to another copper wire." You wouldn't necessarily have to explain how or why it all works (maybe later in the book), just a dumb diagram with plenty of visual instructions. Concepts such as magnetism would have to be worked around for the motor/generator, but that is easy enough. The lightbulb would be more difficult than the motor (electric motor and electric generator are essentially the same thing). I would guess that an alchemist or a priest would be the best person to hand the book to in medieval times in Europe. The alchemist would be used to working with different minerals and metals, and priests were often the most educated. A blacksmith would be able to help. The moslem world was flourishing during those times, and they had a highly advanced grasp of mathematics and science at that time. During the renaissance, your one-stop-shop would have been Leonardo Da Vinci, the original 'renaissance man'. Jack of all trades, and master of them as well. I think that if the book were written the right way, it would be possible for someone in those times to put it all together. If WW2 prisoners of war could build functioning radios out of bits of junk found around the camps, and people 2,000 years ago could make a battery (although the usefulness of the Baghdad battery is disputed), then it would be possible to build some simple electrical devices. As to who would make the best usage for humanity, I couldn't say. After the Roman Empire, Europe was in chaos. Splintered kingdoms who were pretty much all in it for themselves. But I think Leonardo would be your best bet. UPDATE: Thomas Edison's carbon coated bamboo filament lightbulb might work. He already did the hard work inventing it. Not sure how available bamboo was in medieval Europe (assuming you're thinking about Europe). But you could do the research in your current timeline before sending it back to the past. There must be an alternative available to your intended audience. The vacuum inside the bulb could be more or less achieved. A metal box sealed with wax, and emptied of air by a bank of bellows with non return valves. Might be tough to get a complete vacuum, but you'd get a fair way. Maybe oxen turning a geared wheel linked to a cam shaft to keep the bellows going? Have the bulbs and filaments all set up inside the box. Set leather gloves into the side of the box to work on the bulbs inside. Leather would probably leak air into the box, but keep those oxen moving. Promise them a bonus if they make budget. Using the gloves (they'd need to be tight but supple gloves to counter the ballooning that would happen from the negative pressure inside the box, maybe banded with wire), assemble the bulbs. All you'd need to do is attach the glass bulbs onto the bases with the filaments already attached. One problem would be to attach the bulbs and bases together. With the electricity you are already producing, it might be possible to have a soldering iron inside the box. Otherwise some kind of glue, maybe made from boiled sinew, potato starch, whatever. Edison got around 1200 hours of life out of his bamboo filament bulbs. 

Throw in a little bit of magic. As others have already pointed out, flying to space requires WW2 level of tech. However, note the word "to" - most of this advanced tech is needed to take off. Once you are in space, you can fly, literally, in a wooden barrel propelled by fireworks. Space itself is not a harsh environment. You would need a hull that can hold 1 atm of pressure, chemical source of new oxygen (easy), and a way to control the fireworks that propell you. I do not know how do it without electricity while keeping air-tight hull, but electricity of that minimum level has been known at times of American Civil War at least. May be hydraulics? Do not forget heat buildup (coolant system) and radiation ( a layer of foil would do). So, if you create some fantastic way to move spaceship into the space (magic? Permanent teleport from surface to space? capture single enemy ship to use as a launch system?), then, I think, you could do it with Victorian era tech. 

Individual members of the military will deviate from the average. In much the same way that the average soldier will be different from the average man, the average female in the military will not necessarily match the psychological profile of the average female outside the military. Their behavior will necessarily be informed by both their experience and training. Nobody is naturally an ideal soldier or general; the abilities to fight and lead in a war require the suppression of some instincts and the elevation or acquisition of others. 

Reversing gravity If in your world you adopt one of these mechanical explanations for gravity, then you might be able to find ways in which to explain the reversal of the effects of gravity. In particular, if gravity is caused by all matter naturally and invisibly pulsating in phase, putting an object's natural pulsation out of phase will result in it being repelled by ordinary matter (and possibly attracted to matter pulsating at the same phase as itself). Or if gravity is caused by streams of aether being absorbed into matter and sent into another dimension via some invisible gateway, a reversal of that flow such that streams of aether burst out of a body of matter might produce a localized repulsive effect. 

Another issue would be the Hydrogen Sulphide gas (H2S) that is common around volcanic events. For one thing, H2S is an explosive gas. No lights in the castle after dark. No cooking fires, although you've got plenty of lava to cook your food for you. Another thing is that H2S smells bad. It's often referred to as 'rotten egg gas'. You can start to smell it at less than 1 part per million (ppm). That's only a minor problem though. It is also a toxic gas. The 'Short Term Exposure Limit' for H2S is 15 ppm. The smell would cease to bother you after about 100 ppm, as it basically kills your olfactory nerves, permanently ruining your sense of smell. At about 300 ppm, you are pretty much on your way to death, if not dead already. H2S is heavier than air, so it would settle in the lowest parts of the castle. Dungeons and areas enclosed by the wall, rooms on lower floors etc. Nasty stuff. I don't think I'd want to live in that castle. 

As you see, they would be completely alien among any culture on Earth. If they were like this for the long time, they will have their own culture unlike anything on Earth, and you, as writer, would have to build every little fact of it from the ground up, and is not allowed to take anything from any known culture. If your tribe had become like this recently, they are in a dying state because their culture is not adapted to their abilities. Anyway, I can not imagine how they can have any sort of peaceful relation with "normal" people around them. Religious people would see them as abominations that should be killed on sight for the love of God (whatever God). They definitely would not attempt to talk with those tribes. 

An example, at least in terms of the mechanics involved, is the moon. Tidal locking explains this. If you looked at Earth as a star instead of a planet, the moon would always have one side heated, and the other side cooled, as it has one side facing and the other side facing away at all times during its orbit. A night and a day side, with a temperature gradient from one to the other. For an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sol-like sun, the nature of the day/night hemispheres of the planet would depend on how far away it was from the sun. The closer it is to the sun, the larger the heated day side would be, and through atmospheric convection forces, the hotter the night side would be too. At a Goldilocks distance away from the sun (not too hot, not too cold, just right), you'd end up with a band around the planet as a tangent to the orbit, separating the two hemispheres. The temperature within this band could be suitable for life. The hemisphere closer to the sun would be too hot, cooling as it approaches the band. The hemisphere away from the sun would be too cold. So you'd have a permanent day side which is within the temperature gradient suitable for life, and part of a night side which is also suitable for life. Hugh Howey in one of his Molly Fyde books (The Bern Saga series) has a scenario much like this. Half of the world is scorched, the other half frozen. With habitation in a narrow band. Actually, from memory the world in the story had two suns. But the principle would work with only one sun. 

The vegetation biome chart on the Wikipedia Biome article is a good illustration of the degree to which climate variation is not based on mere distance from the equator. 

Peru has warm and cold deserts, alpine mountains, equatorial rainforests, savannah, and temperate subtropics. The contour of land and the flow of wind and water currents have combined to produce a great variety of biomes within a relatively small area, despite being in an area with reduced (compared to more polar regions) differentiation between summer and winter. (Note: Peru does experience seasons, but the biome variation across Peru is not created by seasonal variation.) 

Fran is a naturally subterranean boring worm-like creature. Her cilia enable her to move forward and rotate. On her homeworld, the tunnels are bored with ridges or grooves that serve as affordances for forward locomotion, allowing her species to progress along the intended direction of the tunnel (forward) more easily (and conversely, making it more difficult to walk backwards). 

Teeth Other suggestions delve in biochemistry, but I can suggest an anatomy way: they lack "meat" teeth. We, humans of this world, have sharp, "meat" teeth in front and flat, grinding "plant" teeth on sides. This allows us to chew everything. If elves have only flat teeth, or may be even soft teeth, like wales do, it will be a real chore to bite off and chew meat due to its consistency. Thus, prehistoric elves avoided it altogether, and nowadays they can technically cook it edible, but meat is just not in their culture. 

In Mass Effect the solution was spreading the disease that makes most victims sterile. But again, it needs about 0.75 times of a lifespan to bring result. The real humanely way is to send everybody to another planet, may be cheat the aliens with classic "genie wishes" trick. 

Note that Fran and her fellows don't need an accurate mental map of the network's layout in physical space to navigate the network; they instead need an accurate mental map of the connections between rings, which would look more like a tree structure or hierarchy diagram than a traditional map. 

The planet that the colonists inhabit has few woody plants, and most of them are ill suited for charcoal burning (though fine for routine carpentry). It also never had any planetary events that produced deposits of coal or oil. As a result, the colonists can neither extract fuel from the ground nor reliably burn charcoal from wood in sufficient quantities to fuel any advanced smelting processes. The planet itself has plenty of metal deposits, and the atmosphere of the planet is comfortably similar to Earth's since other photosynthetic lifeforms make up for the missing trees. Without charcoal or coal, the colonists' metallurgy is limited to hammering soft metals that can be found in their native form, like copper, silver, gold, tin, and lead. They can burn small quantities of wood, straw, and other plants to induce metallurgical roasting, but they aren't able to extract iron from ore, smelt alloys like bronze, or forge steel, though they might have small quantities of meteoric iron. This lack of advanced metallurgy has a cascading effect, such that they cannot mass produce copper for wires, let alone effectively harness solar or nuclear energy. The inhabitants instead harness wind and water energy for many major projects, including using water for hydraulic mining to retrieve soft metals like lead, gold, tin, and copper. Froth flotation is also used to increase their available supply of copper and lead.
