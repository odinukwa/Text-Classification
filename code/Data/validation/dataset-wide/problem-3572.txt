The search also suggested doing these barefoot, something I would heavily agree with. What does your squat form look like? Bending your knees that far forward in a bend, is not particularly healthy, especially when practiced frequently. A deep squat still calls for good form. Have you tried pistol squats, goblet squats, split squats, or lunges? Is your squat wide enough? Are your glutes and hamstrings engaged enough? Are you attempting to do these with weights? I find it easier to go really deep in squats if I am weighted. I like to do squats barefoot, in order to feel exactly what I am doing, but that may be just me. The stretch against the wall thing is not really my favorite, but you will find better results if you keep both of your legs back, and then lean against the wall as close as you can, with your body straight. I would suggest a downwards dog stretch to be more effective. Hobbling your ankles with a band, and then taking small steps to feel where you might be going wrong could be helpful, but don't stop there. There are a lot of options with a band. Also try balancing on a pillow or balsu ball with one leg. Try throwing a ball to someone while balancing on one leg, and eventually work your way up to doing medicine ball tosses on one leg, or twisting your torso from side to side while holding the medicine ball and balancing. Plyometric or hiit workouts in general should help because of the amount of jumping they often involve. For that matter, break out a jump rope! You could try laying on your side with your leg in the air, as if to do a leg raise, and then do ankle rolls with your leg suspended. Being completely warmed up, and doing lots of ankle rolls are really what I think it comes down to. Good luck! 

There is a myth that exercise increases the secretion of testosterone. In fact, short duration intense exercise increase testosterone level in the blood while long duration endurance type of exercises decrease. Yet, there is no extra testicular secretion of testosterone. What happens is that the rate of clearance of this hormone from the plasma decrease. Because the liver is a major site for the clearance of testosterone and liver blood flow decreases during exercise. The other reason of increased testosterone could be accounted for by haemo-concentration. That is, during short duration intense exercise you have increased level of testosterone in your blood but it is not due to the testicular secretion of it. 

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) supplementation helps to have significant increases in muscle mass and strength and it is suggested to be taken twice a day, one right after you wake up and again one right before you go to bed (300 mg of starch or 300 mg of a high-concentration ashwagandha root extract). "Ashwagandha is a member of the family of herbs referred to as “adaptogens”. The term “adaptogen” is applied to a herb with phytonutrients that regulate metabolism when a body is perturbed by physical or mental stress, and help the body adapt by (a) normalizing system functions, (b) developing resistance to future such stress, and (c) elevating the body’s functioning to a higher level of performance" Here is a good newly published article about it. Examining the effect of Withania somnifera supplementation on muscle strength and recovery: a randomized controlled trial.. Besides, it is also good for anxiety 

I have worked out for five years. I am 18, 5' female. I am fit, fast, and strong. I know I have made a lot of progress in five years. If I watch what I eat for a week, abs pop out. Yet, I can look at photos from when I was about 12 and I look nearly identical, other than obvious maturing in my face, better posture, and slightly more muscular legs, and slightly broader shoulders. I have gained about 40 lbs, from when I was say, 13, yet I look no different. I even own some of the same clothes. I have totally different eating habits and lifestyle from when I was 12-13, yet I look like I've never been in a weight room. My workouts are designed for me, and they are really good. How come I never got ripped? I want to see those muscles that I can feel. 

The P90X chest and back workout consists of a set of exercises which are done in two sets... do each exercise (pushups, pullups, rows, etc) for X seconds (varies for each exercise), and then repeat the whole thing again. It takes about an hour to complete. I don't have a full hour to devote to the program, but I will be able to do just the "first half" each night. I remember reading that 80% of the muscle mass gain is acquired from the first set, and that repeated sets are mostly done to improve tone. So, my questions are: 

Muscle soreness after exercise is a very common symptom of a strenuous exercise, and is usually indicative of a "good" workout, i.e. one in which you've stressed the muscles to the point at which they will grow stronger. The cause of the soreness is currently unknown. Previous hypotheses involving lactic acid and muscle spasms have been demonstrated to be incorrect. You can provide temporary relief using warm compresses and gentle massaging of the affected muscle, but the soreness will persist until about 72 hours. The best thing to do is to stick to a regular routine; soreness is notably worse the first time a muscle group is significantly stressed. Note that while continuing to exercise will stave off soreness, overstressing can lead to sprains and tears. 

Do not worry about your lungs, they are completely normal. Punctured lungs is a very different clinical condition that needs to be operated. Clue: When you do the twist do not let the motion make the air out of your lungs, you need to contract the side you twisted toward and you squeeze the air out in your control. You will get more benefit by doing this. 

Although it is in different language (may use google translate) in the link here there is a movie about training (pulling 92 lbs bow 57 Times) and pictures of different drills on bow training. You may also try Korean Method for archery training. (read the comments in the page. It can be helpful) I hope all these helps. 

Keep your back and legs straight. Continually check yourself to make sure you haven't sagged. Keep breathing normally. Don't hold your breath. 

I've been working through Ripptoe's Starting Strength and Practical Programming books and training schedule, mostly aiming for basic fitness and building muscle mass. My current workout is mostly squats, deadlifts, bench & standing presses, and a few variations on the plank. True to the full title of starting strength, both of these books focus almost exclusively on barbell training. I've found that I was able to incorporate dumbbells into my workout as necessary (particularly for the standing press). I've recently begun simply playing with the kettlebell - not really using it as part of my workout, just getting to know the basic exercises and motions. So far it seems to me that barbells are typically used for increasing core strength, and dumbbells are typically used for targeted muscle group workouts. My questions are twofold: 

You’ve likely heard of human growth hormone (HGH), a hormone that fuels muscle growth and recovery. Well, this hormone is released during sleep, particularly during deep sleep. This is a good brief info about sleep and muscle growth link with the references at the bottom. Usually, you fall into REM sleep 90 minutes after you fall asleep. Since leucine and growth hormone are the key for protein synthesis and they are released during REM sleep which takes about 1.5-2 hours (Adults can spend up to 20% of their sleep in the REM stage) 2x4hours would also be an option. It looks like at least 3-3.5 hours straight sleep is a must. "Growth hormone promotes growth and repair of muscle tissue, so HGH release during sleep is crucial for muscle building.[2] Growth hormone also plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism, affecting energy supply to muscle. Sleep deprivation may slow muscle growth by altering supply of energy substrate to muscle.[3] If deep sleep is interrupted, the release of growth hormone is halted.[4] Thus, a good night’s rest is crucial for growth hormone’s benefits to take full effect." 

I have a history of injuries, and am no stranger to dealing with them. I had shin splints that developed into stress fractures a year ago. After healing, I have so far managed to prevent their re-occurrence, but at times, I can feel random pain in my tibia. I have been doing careful warm-ups and stretching, and so hope to continue prevention. I have a strange pain in my left calf, along the back side. It is always in the same exact place, and normally subsides after a while. It hurts the worst when I take a step, and have never noticed it when running, only after running. I don't notice it when standing or sitting. I can't figure out what is causing this. It feels like muscle pain. I have two runners knees, and this is developing into quite a serious issue. Two weeks ago I went into complete rest, took a lot of painkillers, and iced multiple times a day. After a week I felt like I was at about 95%, weaned myself off painkillers, and went back to training. For the next week for training I continued icing, and rarely took painkillers. This week the pain is back. It has changed to cover a larger area, travelling into my thighs at times, and sometimes the pain is so great I have difficulty distinguishing where it is coming from. I am not uncomfortable, I can still walk and run, I PR'd last night on my 200m, but I am in constant pain. I've heard that runner's knee is basically just swelling caused by rubbing of the patella against the thighbone. It is not a worrisome pain, it is just painful. I have always had weak knees that popped or bothered me when doing lunges and split squats, and I can no longer do either with a very heavy weight. I have only a month to go before the biggest competition of my life, and I refuse to miss out on this. What should I do? I have looked into k-tape and braces for competition, but don't feel like either would be very helpful. The only thing that makes me feel better is ice and painkillers. 

Most of the migranes are hereditary. Biological states may cause increases in free fatty acids and blood lipids, increased platelet aggregation, decreased serotonin levels and increased prostaglandin levels, which can cause the vasodilatation that precedes migraine headache. One possible reason for this is that a part of the physical reaction may be the elevation of blood pressure (important). The other possible reason can be the physical exertion of the body during exercise, and sudden drop of blood sugar which is the trigger for your exercise-induced headaches. What can you do? drink water and get well hydrated, have good warm-up before exercise, begin slowly then increase your intensity, choose less forceful or lower-impact exercises (by the way, weightlifting seems to be more likely to cause migraines, you may try some preventative medication before exercising, decrease the intensity of the exercise slowly. There are some studies about it Prevention of Exercise Induced Migraine by Quantitative Warm-up The effects of exercise and exercise-related changes in blood nitric oxide level on migraine headache On the good site, Nitric Oxide which is released during exercise may help to relieve the pain (more info: pls, read the article above) 

I'm considering buying a good set of dumbbell weights (pro tip: get them on craigslist) and a bench so that I can work out at home. However, I'm a big fan of the squat, but I don't want to have to also buy an olympic weight bar and plates. Are there any exercises that can be performed with dumbbells that are mostly equivalent to the squat? Thanks! 

Once you have it down, try holding the position for longer and longer. There are also many variants that you can find by searching online; ways to make it easier (rest on knees), ways to make it harder (put toes on a balance ball or against the wall), and other stuff as well. 

Is there a "typical use" for kettlebells? Given my goals (fitness & muscle mass increase), are there any kettlebell exercises that would better suit me than 

Here you go. You just need to have avarage HR and time One of the more standard and most accurate ways to calculate the equation is to use the calorie expenditure formula below . It comes from the Journal of Sports Sciences and provides a formula for each gender. Men use the following formula: Calories Burned = [(Age x 0.2017) — (Weight x 0.09036) + (Heart Rate x 0.6309) — 55.0969] x Time / 4.184. Women use the following formula: Calories Burned = [(Age x 0.074) — (Weight x 0.05741) + (Heart Rate x 0.4472) — 20.4022] x Time / 4.184. ref: $URL$ or less accurate formula: Running (total calories spent per mile) .75 x your weight (in lbs.) Running (Net calories spent per mile) .63 x your weight Adapted from "Energy Expenditure of Walking and Running," Medicine & Science in Sport & Exercise, Cameron et al, Dec. 2004. ref:$URL$
