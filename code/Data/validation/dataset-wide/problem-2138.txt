Suicide? Hardly. You'll live!!! I'd like to give a nod to the East Indian developers I've met in the last few years. Most were male. The guys I'm describing (so this is not an "all" statement) come here, work on contract wherever they can get a foot in the door, make their money, and go back home and invest it in India. They're not so caught up on longevity and becoming a "company boy". The focus is very particular. I'll have to disagree with anybody who says the interests of some business you work for have to come first. The environment today wants to leave a lot of power in the employer's hands, and little to the employees -- for example, how with at-will employment employees can be terminated at a moment's notice, but it's frowned upon if an employee who wants out of the deal doesn't give two weeks notice. There are far more examples. If the situation isn't working for you, and the growth you feel you need for yourself isn't there, BOUNCE. And sometimes you're so suffocated by a job you're already on that you actually NEED to get away from it so you can breathe and regroup. There's no right or wrong. I make it a custom of keeping a wad of money in the bank in case I need to make a break, because I've learned in 20 years of development that companies throw stupid initiatives out there that really show that they don't consider employees as people who think rationally and who actually have power to refuse silly corporate games. We don't think the same when we're living paycheck to paycheck, and as long as we are, the "boss" has power over us. Polish up that resume, invest time in some tutorials, and make sure you can at least speak credibly on the latest dev tools of real value. Sometimes, it's just time. Work doesn't love you back, so you have to love yourself. 

Hold your horses. You do contract work. As any type of worker, you don't list projects on a resume. You're supposed to list businesses you've done the work for. But in this case, you have no explicit contractor-client or business-employee relationship. You can't even claim to be a subcontractor. There are a couple more things to consider here. 

You are right on the mark. Fortran is a dead end. It is not a skill that you are going to be able to use in many places at all. You can't get too focused on 'cool company' because a 'cool company' can go bankrupt overnight, and then you are stuck. 

You're going to kill this opportunity if two recruiters both submit to XYZ. Typically, two submissions will invalidate your chance. Don't mess around! XYZ doesn't want to end up in court with two agencies fighting over the finder's fee. 

You received an offer letter, and replied with an acceptance. THAT'S a contract, and it's legally binding. $URL$ Your failure to move forward, as it is, could at some point be construed as a constructive breach, and the new employer could sue you for damages (i.e. the cost of recruiting someone else after they've turned down all the other applicants). 

I've got a solution. Don't give him any context to bug you about. If you use a Windows box, any time he approaches, hit Windows Key-M, or Windows Key-L. Pick up a book until he leaves. If you need to, take a walk. Talk to him as little as possible. Eventually he'll get the message. It's sad that you'd have to take it so far but this is the extent of what you can do without things getting physical. 

You're overthinking this, Lukas. People work on a contract basis all over the world. The contract coming to an end is a normal and acceptable occasion. Actually, there's no reason to explain in a cover letter why you're leaving your current place of employment. I'd leave it out. But if anyone asks, just tell the truth. It's not as if it's something you can help or change. Don't be embarrassed. 

This is a severe family issue that's likely to take time away from work. Inform your boss that your mom's critically ill. (try to leave out details) and help him to make informed decisions on what to do on days when your family needs you. Consider using your Family Medical Leave Act rights if you're in the US. 

The offer letter is just a start. I hope you kept a copy. Since this is remote, I'd want some documents establishing legitimacy of the business. A business license. Articles of incorporation. Dun and Bradstreet number, for a business credit report. Certified (by a CPA) financial statement. Something you can verify independently with a government body or official. And better yet, the opportunity to meet someone face to face at their offices before you accept the offer. Not Skype. This is your livelihood at stake, and scams come a dime-a-dozen. So as uncomfortable as it may be to ask, consider the potential outcomes if you don't. 

Rather than funding "dinner", go to happy hour. If you have to spring for appetizers, that's not cheap-ish, and if anyone wants entrees instead then they can foot the bill for those. Make sure you SPECIFICALLY make the offer for only drinks and appetizers. Some will want alcohol, and others will not -- don't worry about that part. 

You've had the input you've needed already. Let it go. Pretend for a second: You're a builder of homes. You lead your team to build a beautiful house-on-a-hill somewhere, with the best amenities that money can offer. The details about the customer are foggy, but you're taking home a paycheck. Finally, it's done. Six months later, you see that same house get smashed to pieces while watching the latest Matt Damon spy thriller in the neighborhood theater. Should you be ticked off? There's NOTHING you could do about it. Let it go. Why stress over it? 

As the comments are showing here, maybe you've misinterpreted what your manager actually meant. You might feel that maybe it's rude to inquire, but honestly the only way to know for certain what your manager meant by his expression would be for you to put your vexation aside and just ask him. If you were to run to upper management without truly understanding what was expressed, you'd end up looking like an ass. Not worth it. Ask! 

All that you can do is to document your efforts to mitigate in as much detail as possible. Send a "memorandum" e-mail to your team lead each time you have a conversation, such as: 

Here in California, we have a "Final Paycheck" law. The following paragraph is a law office's summary: 

I'm sensing that you're more concerned with hierarchy and being the boss than you are with actually listening to the people who are doing the work. 

This is not a job offer. This is an eight-week project. $500, for eight weeks of work? 320 hours (if 40 hours a week) means $1.56 an hour. C'mon, now. Really? I did a Google search for "gFire cryptocurrency". Nothing. Maybe this is something the company is creating to try and distribute. You might have better luck selling sand at the beach. As for the shares... shares in a company with no value == no value. Run away, fast! 

Uh-oh. Joe Strazzere pointed out a potential crack in the whole foundation of your position there. I'm going to follow his reasoning and proof. You're a project manager but not the actual line supervisor of these people you're writing about. Responsibility over people without authority has very specific challenges. It's documented here, and here, and here. You're trying to deal with the symptoms, but overlooking the underlying cause. You're not the first to be in this kind of fire-fight, but you have to work from the bigger-picture approach upstream of all the little issues. Take a breather and focus there because that's going to give you the most mileage. 

Quit while you're ahead. This would be like a plumber dealing with someone who doesn't want to use the word 'pipe'. This client has personal sensitivities that are way beyond your ilk. You are a developer, and not a shrink. Doubtlessly there are going to be lots of other occasions where you run into some incredibly stupid stuff based on this person's need to be more empathetic than reasonable -- which is why there was an opening to do this work in the first darned place. Smile real wide, and RUN. 

Be straightforward. Set a CLEAR boundary -- one that he can't misunderstand. Use the same statement whether you're talking, using IM, or whatever. "Sorry, I have far more important things to do than to discuss my lunch each day with you. But if you have something work related, then I'm all ears." You might have to only say this one time! 

YES, they would leave someone inexplicably clueless. Happens all the time. The recruiter could be on vacation, or the manager, or they could have a freeze, or any number of reasons. The end result is aggravating, yes. But you are not unique. You can call back, but be careful to not frustrate yourself. 

I'm not sure what your office situation is, but in some environments seeing people with headphones on might be deemed to look a bit unprofessional. I'm really not understanding why you haven't taken your administrator up on the highly unusual offer that you can simply close your door and listen through speakers. Are you just "difficult"? The place I'm working at has visitors (potential clients with LOTS of money) about once a week and the receptionist sends everyone an e-mail to keep their work areas ship-shape. We don't have the headphone restriction, but we don't have offices, either. I'm sharing this so maybe you can consider the bigger picture than just yourself and your own convenience. 

Don't use a manager, by ALL means. It will be a strike against you. If you don't get hired on the new job, you don't want too many people at the old one knowing that you're looking to leave. Your current boss will go into panic mode, I guarantee, and will likely start treating you unfavorably. Even if you're pressed for "current managerial references", DON'T DO IT. Use a trusted peer if you have to. 

It is absolutely a healthy thing. Caffeine causes unnatural constriction of the blood vessels, and interferes with the body's natural cycles. Overdoing it increases risks of a heart attack, over time. I like the taste, but I had to switch to decaf. 

You can throw some variation of this at your client, since you seem to be dealing with a control freak: "Good, fast, or cheap? Pick two!!!" The premise is that your client can't have good, fast, above-the-call of duty service without paying a premium for it; that you can't deliver good service if your client wants it fast and cheap; or that if the client wants good, cheap service, then it's going to not be anything you flag internally as 'priority'. Think about it like this. I live 20 minutes from Disneyland, but I've driven out before and it's taken close to an hour to get into a parking space -- but Disney has 'premium' spaces for those who want a space RIGHT NOW. And the lines for the rides can be circumvented, FOR A PRICE. Just hold fast that your client should never, I repeat, never get something for nothing -- or this will become the expectation every time. 

Give him what he wants - a bunch of constants. Build your enums from constants. The constants are "shippable". Presto. Use this for declarations. 

If you ever get a delinquent account notice (e-mail or snail-mail) from a utility or phone company, demanding payment, is that "rude"? Think about it. It's never rude to demand payment, so you that can feed yourself and tend to your responsibilities. That's called handling your business! On the other hand, it's not very smart to work for free. It becomes more severe (I'm making no assumptions here) once you're paying bills, rent / mortgage, and feeding a family, so learn this lesson quickly. The other stuff you wrote about "small company", which seems to translate into you short-changing yourself out of pity, is a moot point. With a big company or a small one - if the agreement is to pay you $X per hour, then that's what you're owed at paycheck time. That's why every state has laws to protect employees from employers who try to underpay them. Before you go in, CONFIRM that it's paid time. 

There will never be any shortage of people who have contributed to others' efforts without any prior agreement for compensation who end up feeling used and abused. You've done this for three years, and I must say from the beginning that overall this is no one's doing but your own. People don't appreciate what you give away for free. What's worse: in your situation, when you decided to gather the courage to ask for what you're worth, you got fed a "line" by your supervisor to basically put you back in your low place on the totem pole. But let's trace back to whenever you started doing these tasks outside of the 'secretary' responsibilities. How did it come about? I'm going to take a guess that maybe you spotted something awry in a report, or overheard a conversation about a lapse, and decided to get yourself involved and fix the issue. Or maybe you were initially recognized at some point by a supervisor for being a problem-solver in a pinch. In either case, the end result was an ego stroke. And the people over you figured that because you never raised a need beyond an ego stroke, you were happy just receiving a "good job" and a pat on the back. Now, three years in, you're demanding change -- but they've gotten used to you accepting the pat on the back, so you're getting push-back. The good news is that you seem to be a valuable asset to a team. The bad news is that you're going to have to find another team, on another job; when you do, don't miss any opportunity to speak up for yourself, or you're going to find yourself in the same boat again. There's some program in your head that says that it's selfish or improper to ask for help with your needs until you're at a desperate point. I really hope you can find this thing, and choke the living sh-- out of it. You seem like a great person, and to reach this goal you're going to have to start putting yourself first much sooner. Best of luck. 

Document, document, document. This is a surefire way to keep the lines of communication open between you and the client, so that your client doesn't ever get the idea that he's being left in the dark. On the other hand, you must assign milestones to the stages in the project (or bill by the hour), and make sure that the client understands that the time it's taking to document, or even talk, is a PAID part of the work product you're turning over. Don't do ANYTHING off-the-books. Be sure that this is perfectly clear from the beginning and if the client balks, leave him alone. Sometimes it's not worth the headache to deal with. 

"Author" comments in source code are truly a real waste of time in a team setting where lots of hands are going to be modifying the code. In a professional setting, the source control system tags who's done what. For a web site, the end-user doesn't care who wrote the code, but only that it works to satisfaction. In the long run, it's probably best to put ego and getting credit (smile) aside and focus on what actually makes money for the business. If you're writing great code, nobody is going to question who's doing what, because the work will speak for itself. 

I don't think you make a good employee. I don't make a good one either; it's not a bad thing, but it is what it is. That's one of the reasons I run my own consulting business. I'll dare to say that MOST companies aren't ready for a steady stream of innovation no matter how much the employment postings, literature, and web sites boast. The reason for this is that innovation, in itself, doesn't pay any bills. A business cannot sustain any repeat business if it is always "re-innovating" its internal processes (including IT operations). Innovation takes time to plan, purchase, train, implement, and support. As I wrote previously, I run my own consulting business. I get work from clients when they are ready to innovate within their organizations. Sometimes it's three months, and sometimes it is for much longer lengths of time. I like the excitement of being an important part of something new (and I think you might be very similar) but it totally turns me off to think of being the person who babysits things once all the newness has worn off. Some of us are cut out for the babysitting jobs, but I am not. I don't apologize for who I am because I understand that my role is very valuable. Just the same, once I've done my part, I move on to the next achievement. Some of the other posts here mention that you should take a good look at yourself instead of making the employers out to be the problem. I think neither you or the employers are at fault here. You are repeatedly trying to impose what you want to be doing as a higher priority than the employers' current, actual needs. Now, what's the definition of insanity??? It's the act of doing the same thing again and again and expecting different results. You either need to market your talents to a different crowd that needs what you're offering, OR get a job and just do what's asked of you. Best of luck.
