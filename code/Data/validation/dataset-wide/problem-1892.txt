Additional info : They know I already have signed a contract as I've told them, but they said they still want to go for an interview. 

in an aggressive tone (for me, and for other employees as well, as she exclaimed this in public) She sent a request to said employee to do task A, and the employee has indeed finished the task according to specifications. I read the request, and I confirmed that he did the job. The root of the issue, she said, is that he didn't do what she asked him to do exactly, basically, miscommunication. In an IT person's head, the job was done. I read it and interpreted it as such where he actually did the job correctly, when she actually meant something else. She has no IT experience (makes me wonder how she became a project manager in the first place, but that's for another topic), so she can't communicate very well with IT staff. What is the problem here, and what should I do? Is it the miscommunication? Her lack of IT knowledge? Or the badmouthing? Should I talk to my supervisor about this, and if so, how should I approach this? 

Additional info : I'm planning to leave, in case I can't work under Y directly. So I guess that adds to my negotiating power. 

I found this as one of the more fun aspects of a profile in LinkedIn, however, I wonder if it even matters for employers and recruiters. 

I was wondering if some recruiters would see it as negative, thinking I might not be focused or committed to my permanent job if I had a freelance project on the side. Obviously, more showable work experience is an advantage, but I'm wondering if I'm overlooking some disadvantages in listing concurrent freelance projects. 

First, get to know why there is none already. May be water cooler chat ? Apart from what everyone else has suggested -if you are so passionate about source control, if I were you, I would do this : 

The best way to tackle such situations at a workplace ? I dont know of any other way but to greet the other person with a smile either in the elevator or the foyer. May be get into friendly banter if you work in the same team or meet outside at a common friends party and take it from there. Tread extremely carefully, though. Most companies have integrity/sexual harassment hot lines for any untowardly approaches at the workplace. Of course, what is untowardly is relative. Unfortunately, even a genuine attempt to befriend the fairer sex can backfire and people have lost jobs and these incidents have gone into police records. Some companies have very strict policies/measures in place for workplace romance/dating. 

My workplace has a closed cubicle layout. My cube is so designed that I sit with my back facing the entrance of the cube. All was well until recently the company I work for acquired another company which has resulted in an increased employee count. I am now seated amongst new and diverse coworkers. A lot of coworkers will walk into my cube and even before beginning a conversation start looking at my screen. And will keep on reading whatever I was doing even as they are talking. I find this extremely annoying. 

Going by your other questions, you dont seem to be from the HR.Just curious, why would you bother yourself with these logistics ? It is almost an industry standard that the interviewer calls the applicant. Even if its a group interview, most of the interviewers will call the conference number and then call the applicant. As another member pointed out, I would find it out of the ordinary if the interviewers asked me to call them or even asked me for a preference. I take it as a protocol that the HR will decide these logistical details and the interviewer and myself will stick to that schedule. It has only been once ever that I called into a conference number, that was when the interviewers were in different countries and I was told to call the conference number. If I were given a choice, since I have never been asked my preference before for phone calling, my mind would have wandered off thinking : Why am I being asked this question ? What if I say that I want to be called - will the company think I am being arrogant ? What if I say that I will call - will the company think am desperate for this job ? What is this - a subliminal interview question ? Will the salary offered to me depend on how I answer this ? And so on. 

I don't see the need to burn any bridges here. If the person was asking for a recommendation then your professional image would be on the line and then you would have to think twice but as it is, you could easily with one little email send the person the details of the manager or even just a link to the job posting. This makes you seem like the helpful one and even if it does happen that the person is not suitable, you are not the bad guy. It is after all not your job to do the hiring. Maybe you are not even able to judge a worthy candidate seeing as there may be mitigating circumstances to this person hiring that you may simply be unaware of. 

Generally speaking, no full-time employment will commence without a work contract in place. In most cases what your employer expects from you will be made plain. So except maybe if it is expressly mentioned that wages will be reduced for slow work what he is doing is most probably a breach of contract. Even if tardiness is mentioned in the contract, contract law does provide the remedy that if a contract is deemed to be grossly unfair to one party then a petition can be made to make it invalid. I think you would have a decent case for that. Remember that a work contract is like any other, both parties have the right to have it enforced. You may want to employ the council of a labor attorney or at the very least a union rep, this seems to be exactly the type of exploitive behavior they fight against. 

What does it matter? You seem to be under the impression that the fact that the possible employee had his/her parent at the interview indicates a lack of maturity but that may very easily not be the case. Why is it though that a parent bringing a child to an interview is more of a problem than a cabby bringing him? If the cabby was willing to wait an hour before taking the interviewer home would that have been a problem for you? Even if the whole premise of your argument is true and this is one massive mommies-boy who will suck at the teat of his parents for the rest of his life, what does this matter? Are his qualifications and experience predicated on what you consider to be "mature"? You are there to make a decision on whether this person is the ideal candidate for a job listing, not to make judgments on what you perceive to be a lack of maturity, if this is the type of thing that bothers you from a programmer then you are going to find it hard to find a candidate. Most programmers I know are a-social, borderline sociopaths with a god-complex dependant on the level of salary. Having mommy issues would be appropriate. 

Given this, I personally think I could reduce the "unemployment" gap if I started applying early. However, given my vacation schedule, I wouldn't be able to attend interviews in that time period. These are the options I can see right now : 

Send applications on late April to early May, and be able to do interviews before vacation starts. If the question "When will you be able to start?" comes up, I'll mention my schedule. Send applications during vacation stating that I'll only be able to attend interviews starting on June 26. Both of the above Only start applying when I get back home 

Number 4 is the safest, however, I think I'd be spending more time as an unemployed man, and I want to minimize that as much as possible. What option would be best in terms of employer convenience and minimal unemployment time? 

These outbursts are damaging the work environment and may emotionally affect the other employees. The work productivity is most probably affected, and as HR, it is your job to take action to keep your employees at their best possible shape to work productively for the company. You said you talked with him and I think that's great, but if it's still continuing, you have to devise other methods. Maybe he needs a short break from work to calm himself, or some other thing you can think of to improve his situation. But I believe action must be done, and it must be done fast. P.S. Take my advice with a grain of salt as I am no expert in these types of things. :) 

I'm in quite of a bind here. Although this is unintentional, I've found myself in an awkward situation where I've been offered a job that I'm interested in while being on annual leave, and I'm not coming back for 1 more week. I'm currently overseas where coming back isn't an option unless I wait for my return flight which comes in a week. I don't exactly have the luxury of time to wait until next week to personally hand in my resignation letter, so I'm looking to do it by email. Is there anything I should be aware of? Anything ethics related, or when the notice period starts, and things I could do to smoothen the process? Thanks! 

This is a bit open ended without knowing some more details and also I am not clear if you are being asked to provide a justification or just want to do it to clear your conscience ? Nevertheless, this has always happened with me. Manager would ask me to create a presentation saying 'Just make a straw man (brief outline) - something we will revisit' Once the straw man was in place he would ask me to 'just beef it up - be a wordsmith- we will revisit this when required'. Done. And after forgetting about it for a few weeks the slides would come up at various client meetings. This was embarrassing for me. Primarily because I had invented a few words that I thought I could laugh about with my manager over a beer. If something wrong is being pointed out - even if you had worded it as draft and the emails say its a draft, what can you do now, the damage is done. Anyone can edit the text and remove the word draft just before the presentation. I realized that the best thing was to wait for the appropriate moment and say 'Wow - look at that - I never thought this draft would be the last option for our team. Wish I could polish it a little more' I never made another draft thinking this will really just remain a draft. 

I have never seen a resume where a candidate listed any of the skills as "out of practice". From my limited knowledge, I dont think thats a yard stick used anywhere. Most technical interviewers go by the timeline of projects on your resume and its perfectly acceptable in an interview to say "Its been a while I since I used that language so my answers may seem a bit rusty". Obviously, if you are applying to a job which involves C, you would want to be better prepared with your knowledge in C. If in your resume you have a technical summary section, then you can simply list C as one of the programming languages in your repertoire. And if your resume lists project details and environments, mention C where ever you have used C.
