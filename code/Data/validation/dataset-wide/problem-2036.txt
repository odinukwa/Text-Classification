I always request some time to talk with my potential coworkers. For me at least, teammates are a very important attribute of the job. If I like and respect my teammates, I tend to like the job. I always ask my potential teammates what it is like to work for the potential boss, what it's like working at the company, what they like, and what they don't like. I find that I get very honest answers from folks would would be my peers. And when I'm the hiring manager, I always bring in one of the candidate's potential teammates to participate in the interview process. I don't consider this as too forward or inappropriate at all. I think it's smart. 

"How it usually works" isn't as important as how you want it to work. Get it included in the contract, and whoever accepts the contract will do things the way you want without regard to how others do it. 

Concentrate on his performance on the job, and not why it nosedived. You have suspicions, but you don't really know the "why". And either way, the "why" is not your problem, it's the employee's problem. If you are the employer, in general you don't care why an employee's performance has drastically changed for the worse, only that it has, and only that it turn around. Have a talk with this employee. Indicate what you have observed. Indicate that this negative change cannot continue. Indicate the consequences that could arise if this doesn't change now. Let the employee decide for himself why it has happened, and what he needs to do to reverse the trend if he wants to continue to be employed. As the employer, you need to hold employees responsible for their performance. Employees need to decide what is important to themselves. 

This is something you'll need to ask the international IT company, as it depends solely on your agreement with them. It's not a lot different from the question "is lunch break time billable?" Personally, if I had a team of contractors working on a project, and I saw them all taking 30-minute walkaround breaks every day, I'd be very concerned. I would go back to the contracting company and ask what was going on. And my contract with them would typically allow me to have any or all replaced if they weren't working up to my expectations. If I thought the 30-minute break was necessary (it usually isn't), and the working being produced was better for it, then I wouldn't complain. And a one-time or very occasional 30-minute break when stuck is perfectly reasonable. But anyone who gets stuck repeatedly and needs to take 30 minutes to get unstuck is demonstrating that they aren't sufficiently qualified to work at a client site. I'd have them removed and replaced with someone who didn't get stuck so often. TL;DR: When you want to know what is billable and what is not, read your contract and talk with the contracting company. That's the only way you will know for sure. 

Not necessarily. Managers over time do tend to reflect the culture of the company. In part, that is their job. Additionally, the culture of the company by definition changes them. But if the HR person ("Hiring Manager") is new, or trying to change the culture, they initially may not reflect the culture at all. Eventually they must either change the culture, fit in or look elsewhere. 

6 weeks is a long time. When I was hiring, I'd be very disappointed to learn at the last minute that the candidate needed an unexpected 6 weeks because the start date wasn't thought through fully. That said, just ask. While it may well make a bad first impression, it likely won't be fatal. If they wanted you badly enough, they'll likely find a way to wait. Be prepared with your reply if they say "No" - you can give up your stock options or decline the job acceptance. If you do ask for an extension, consider not just asking for "6 weeks" unless you are willing to actually be there in 6 week - even if the sale date of your company takes longer. Instead, be honest, indicate why you are requesting the extension, indicate how long you suspect it will take, but admit that you don't really know for sure. (For future reference, if you are anticipating a company event that you want to be around for - a bonus, an IPO, an acquisition, whatever - delay the start of your job search until after the event. This is what most people would do, specifically to avoid the kind of situation you find yourself in. These things always take longer than expected.) 

You could always casually ask your boss about the meetings, and ask if you could be of some help. But remember that meetings aren't about making everyone feel equal. Meetings are (or should be) about getting things done. Only people who are necessary should be included in meetings. If this is a strategy meeting, then your boss, two senior individuals and a team lead may be just the right people for this particular meeting. Even if this is a small, flat company, you can't expect to attend every meeting. 

If you are sure that your English language skills are the thing holding you back (rather than the lack of other skills), then there is no good way to "get past" the phone interviews without improving your English skills. And the way to improve at anything is to practice. Do you have English-speaking friends? Perhaps they would be willing to talk with you on the phone on occasion, provide feedback, and help you improve. Have them play the part of the interviewer, while you practice interviewing. Record your practices, and play them back to see how you sound. Listen to English-language radio/television/podcasts. Repeat what you are hearing. 

When thinking about a job that you believe will only last 4-6 months, you should be looking for a short-term contracting position (or a series of positions lasting until you move). If that can be accommodated by your ex-employer that could work out well. If you are honest with Company B about leaving in 4-6 months then that could be fine too. Otherwise, start looking for temp jobs. 

Unless you have a contract or union rules specifically prohibiting such a revocation, then Yes - a company can revoke a transfer for any reason it chooses. IF you have incurred expenses after the transfer was granted but before it was revoked, then it would be reasonable for you to ask for reimbursement. 

No. Starting to convey your family issues as reasons why you cannot complete their task is most likely going to drop you from consideration completely. 

You should mind your own business and stay out of it entirely. This is between a husband and wife. (This was what HR was hinting for you to do). If you can't, then you should advise your friend to get counseling, and probably to find a new job and quit.
