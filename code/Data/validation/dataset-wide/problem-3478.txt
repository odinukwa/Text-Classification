You are correct: an increase in the wage does not by itself imply an increase in GDP. So, if you pay a worker \$20 for an hour of overtime which you could have bought from another worker for \$10, but they both produce the same thing, GDP does not change by switching from one arrangement to the other. You can also observe that from the 'income perspective' in the circular flow of the economy: if nothing else changes, a higher wage for a worker results in lower profits for the firm, but the net effect on income is 0. However, a change in which hours are labeled as overtime and which are not could have important effects in the economy. You'd expect that on average firms will prefer to have relatively more workers working relatively few hours and so avoid paying overtime. This should increase employment, but not average worker income, it should reduce inequality among workers, etc. Potentially there can be large effects are on the health insurance costs of firms of changing overtime laws. 

One typical story people tell is that in some countries there are strict population control policies and if families have a large economic incentive to have either a son or a daughter, they might neglect their pregnancy or terminate it if the child is not the gender they want it to be. In some societies the economic incentives to have sons or daughters are very different: typically sons are expected to bring in a working wife into the family, with a dowry, but daughters are expected to leave to the husband's family and take a dowry with them. 

It seems to me that many people work to become wealthy, but not because they want to consume all that wealth. Many people give it away, other's don't, but still they do not spend it. You hear about some rich 40-year old's throwing money away, but you seldom hear of a rich 80-year-old throwing anything away! What is the economic theory for "scrooge"? Are there simple preferences that make this the right strategy? (I head somebody say that JP Morgan used to say it was a way of keeping score. Is there a theory of this?) 

Its one of those cases where math is clearer that words I think: Yes, the definition of an agent with utility function $U(C)$ being risk averse is that $E[U(C)]<U(E[C])$ but this is true iff $U''(C)<0$, i.e. if U is concave, i.e. if U'(C) is decreasing. How would you represent the fact that you are twice as happy with two units than with one unit, but that you don't like the uncertainty? You have that $U(A*C)=A*U(C)$ for any A which directly means $E[U(C)]=U(E[C])$. So you need to add something for you to dislike the uncertainty. You could add something like a 'habit' or an expected consumption $E[C]$, and say that you care not only about how much you consume but also about how close it was to what you expected. [Edited to reflect correction suggested by @user1559897] Lets call this new utility function $V$ and define it as $V(C,E[C])=U(C)-b*(C-E[C])^2$. Now, if C could be 5 or 10, with E[C]=7.5, then you have that $V(10,10)=U(10)=2*U(5)=2*(V(5,5))$, which looks like risk neutrality, but at the same time, you have $E[V(C,7.5)]<V(7.5,7.5)=V(E[C],7.5)$, which looks like risk aversion! You could then state that, according to the definition, he is risk averse to variation in C after he forms the expectation $E[C]$, but risk neutral to variation in C before he forms that expectation. 

Some economists (Oliver Hart and John Moore are among the most prominent) have developed a "theory of the firm" which could help address some of the issues involved. One of the considerations in that theory is that the different parties involved in production can 'hold-up' each other. For example, in this case, the brake manufacturer or the auto manufacturer can suddenly threaten to cancel the relationship with the other party, unless the contract is improved. This, in turn, means they don;t invest much in each other and production is inefficient. Under that scenario, the optimal solution is for a single party to be the owner of all crucial processes. This relates to your question in the sense that, from this perspective, the manufacturer is better off buying the individual parts because then it's much harder for anybody to hold it up. Put simply, it has more negotiating power. It will want to in-house processes that are simple, but which could hold it up. alternatively, it will want to have some serious lawyer power writing the contracts with all its suppliers so that they can't come up with any surprises. That's hard to do. The principle that this is hard to do is called the 'incomplete contracts' principle. (edits in response to comments:) Other key authors in the theory of the firm are Ronald Coase, Oliver Williamson and Sandy Grossman. For Coase, as long as property rights are well-defined, market allocation would be efficient regardless of who owns what. However, there are transaction costs in markets, maybe you can think of them as contracting or negotiating costs). The firm overcomes the costs of transactions by creating non-market relationships within itself. The boss does not negotiate with the worker every day. This can be more efficient than having all activity being performed in the marketplace. 

In sum, what the Big Mac index reflects is that the price of non-tradeables is different in a way that reflects the productivity differences in tradable goods. Magic! 

Suppose that you cannot trade capital. I.e., you cannot ship savings from one place to another. In that case, if region A saves 10, region A will invest 10. If region B saves 1, it will invest 1. So, from that example, you can conclude that if markets for capital are closed, the correlation between savings and investment is 1. For completeness, now imagine the free flow of capital situation: region A saves 10, region B saves 1, but it is in region B where all the investment opportunities are, so the regions trade in capital: A invests all its savings in B, and investment in B is then 11, and investment in A is 0. In this second example I and S are therefore negatively correlated ... 

Out of the total production in an economy, a big part is market-based, as when you make something and sell it. But a big part is not, as when you make something and don't sell it, but exchange it or use it in some way. Examples of this are home production, cooking, washing, etc, as well as gifts to friends, social service, etc. More over, the fraction of production that is market-based probably changes over the business cycle. For example, suppose that, in a recession, I agree to cook for my neighbor every other day because we are both unemployed. He cooks for me every other day. In a boom, instead I get a newly created job which pays me 50 dollars a day, and I by a 10 dollar a day meal from my neighbor who now sells me the food he cooks. The economy is only producing 50 dollars more since we used to produce two meals a day and now we are producing the same two meals a day plus 50 dollars. However, because I pay for the 10 in food, it seems the economy is producing 60 dollars more instead of just 50. Other things that happen in recessions that don't count as output: when you are unemployed, you fix your house, you make art, etc. Maybe businesses give away more goods and services because they have the installed capacity, but not the demand... Is there a way to measure the size of this effect? 

I think you have to look at the concept of spurious regression. A key idea useful to interpreting correlations like this is the idea of "spurious regression". Any two time series X and Y each of which has a trend (even if it's a "random trend" !) will appear to have a high negative or positive correlation. (This is because, if there's a trend, all the values above the mean and all the values below the mean will tend to be on opposite sides of the time series, for both series. A high correlation then tells you that the above the mean values of one series coincide with the above(or below) the mean values of the other series...which is not very surprising.) A high correlation in this setup is an interesting finding if it's a correlation of the 'de-trended' series, or of the 'differenced' series. Also, plot the series since then. The stock market has gone through upturns and downturns that do not seem to be related to the monetary base in any way. 

Is there a simple way to figure out how many new businesses appear and disappear each year in the US economy? It seems a key question to figure out how the economy is changing over time, although I suppose the data is potentially messy... 

A useful principle to have in mind here is the so called 'volatility paradoxÂ´ oft-cited by Marcus Brunnermier (Princeton prof): The idea is as follows: a) financial institutions are in the business of taking reasonable risks; b) when the financial system is deemed very stable, then it makes sense for financial institutions to engage in risky activities, because, if the system is stable those risky bets are manageable, reasonable bet; c) when all financial institutions jointly engage in risky activities, the system becomes unstable. In other words, safety engenders individual risk-taking, which creates aggregate risk. This works the other way too: riskiness engenders risk averse attitudes, which lead to a stable system. If you believe this story then you get some insight into why its difficult to predict crises: they happen when risks build up during periods of safety and stability... 

In principle, there are two effects of merging companies that have opposite effects on welfare/efficiency: A) A merger could result in more efficient production. This could be because the merged firm will adopt the practices of the most productive of the two original firms. Alternatively, it could be because of economies of scale. We think that many processes are more efficient if they are done on a bigger scale. The investment in designing a product and designing and installing a very efficient production process only pays off if you have a large enough scale. finally, it could even happen because it's efficient for a single entity to own the upstream and downstream processes in order to avoid negotiation costs and invest heavily in relationship-specific technology. B) On the other hand, a merger could result in less competition. This could happen because the two companies were competing against each other and they are no longer doing so after the merger. It could also happen because the new larger firm is going to be a dominant player in input and output markets. It will be able to dictate terms to its suppliers, and also to its consumers, and even to its specialized employees. The presence of these effects means that the work of anti-trust regulators is complex. They have to evaluate the likelihood on one of the effects being bigger than the other before the merger takes place in order to allow it or block it. Often what they do is to impose conditions on the merged entity in a way that guarantees that it will not be a dominant player. 

There's no such thing as a law of conservation of wealth. Wealth is created and destroyed in many ways. It is created when society produces goods and saves them. It is destroyed in disasters, or consumed when we use up our savings.It is created when we create knowledge, software, etc. In a toy example: when a society starts out without any saved food, it produces food, eats half and saves half, then it is richer at the end. The accumulated food is an asset. There's all kinds of wealth in a society: patents, ideas, buildings, roads, cars, computers, education, etc. What does not get created or destroyed are nominal claims that we have against each other: if I give you a paper promising to pay you 10, that makes you 10 richer and it makes me 10 poorer but that's it. This means that its pretty had to figure out what is a society's total wealth, because there's all kinds of claims, explicit or implicit that are hard to value. 

The typical recipe for countries to improve their growth rate and escape high indebtedness is to reduce expenditure and implement structural reform. What do people use as evidence of structural reform working? 

The official rate is about 10, but the black market rate is about 1000. Also, yes, apparently the real exchange rate at the 1000 rate is pretty low, in the sense that one dollar buys a lot of local goods, (like boarding). Indeed, that's what it means, 10,000 dollars buys you 1,000,000 VB's, which pays for years and years of rent. The ratio in your numbers is that Venezuela is about 50 times cheaper. In this story, staying in a hotel costs $5, which is also about 50 times cheaper than staying in a hotel in L.A.... (It would be hard to change such a large amount of dollars without getting noticed though...) 

This seems counterintuitive right?: Why would they become a larger part of the economy if they are inefficient? Clearly, this depends on the exact substitutability of products and the rate of satiation. However, in principle, its not difficult to imagine how this happens. Suppose we can only eat about 2000 kilo-calories a day. Back when we were eating 1000 kc/d, increasing farm productivity increased out consumption of food, and potentially the size of our income we devoted to food until we hit the 2000 kc/d. But as farm productivity increases more, we eat the same, but it costs less and less to produce it, so we devote less and less of or budget to it. Which means we devote more and more to services... 

Correct, both a fixed exchange rate and a manipulated exchange rate involve the government setting this price. In BOTH cases it is usually implemented by promising to standing ready to buy or sell any amount at the fixed price. Of course, countries don't always have enough foreign cash to sell it at the promised price, nor do they always want to buy as much as the markets sell to them The difference is, as you suggest, whether the trading partners (the US is usually the one that labels others manipulators) conclude that the exchange rate is fixed at a too depreciated level. This level keeps foreign goods cheap in the US and US goods expensive in the foreign country. Also, a fixed exchange rate is often set at a lvel that seems "too high", the only question being whether the government will manage to keep it so high, since it creates an incentive for its citizens to buy foreign goods. Instead a manipulated currency is deemed to be "too low".
