Space, the ultimate cold and empty place. Send them up the cheapest way possible, and let them do their nanite thing up there. The temperature of the nano-huddle will sadly never get down to Universe-background-radiation levels, because in cheap orbits, the earth still is a major heat radiator, but still, with a heat shield plenty cold - about 180°K (= - 90°C, = - 135°F). Also, get them a soot colored blanket and radar damper if they are not able to assume the necessary surface themselves (but as nanobots, being smaller than visible light, they should) for added invisibility, and non-heating. The orbit being, say, 500km up also saves lots of fuel, and therefore money. The usual sunsynchronous orbit will go over the poles, because it's ideal for imaging purposes, but we'll stay over the equator, wich saves fuel again. With about 2500\$ per kg, your 100M\$ will lift about 40 tons, which may or may not be enough, depending on the size of your swarm. (Though even if they are mostly lead (~10g/cm³) and with (100nm)³ just at the edge of not being nanobots but microbots, 40tons are 4*10^19 units... IPv4 wouldn't cut it, you'd need IPv6 to even adress them. When the time comes, they assume their reentry form, manipulate their magnetism to break orbit by interacting with the earths magnetic field, and come over us like a swarm of very small locusts. With the constraint of 25m of low-entropy in every direction, space is the best option by far - Standard molar entropy for substances differs, but it's still higher than for no matter at all. Even a ground based hangar has one half of its periphery as solid matter, which at ~40 J/(molK) is much better than water (70 J/(molK)) but a hemisphere of 25km radius contains a f**kton (technical term) of moles, so there goes the neighborhood. 

Silicon based life could exist, silicon and carbon are chemically quite related. The problem is in the food: we cannot consume carbon dioxide, because you cannot metabolize it with energy gain (plants metabolize it, but they put solar energy into it, converting it to sugars, which they then use for energy (and we use those, too)). So the Goron would either use some energy-source (magic, sunlight, pressure,...) to essentially up-convert the silicon dioxide from stones, and then feed on that product. 

The most valuable data probably comes from Operation plowshare. In one test, a 104 kt explosion, displaced 11 million tons of soil, about 100 ton of soil for a ton of TNT. Let's say for the sake of getting a lower bound, that Mount Everest is made of soil. Mt. Everest has a volume of about 1.5 million million cubic meters, and a cubic meter of soil weighs about 1.5 tonnes, so a soil Everest should weigh a little over 2 million million tonnes. So we should need at least 20 000 million tonnes of TNT for the job. If instead we used thermonuclear bombs of the highest yield, we'd only need 344 of them. In 1960 the combined yield of the US nuclear stockpile was just about 20 000 Mt, so that would be in the ballpark of what is required. Of course, Mount Everest isn't made of soil, but on the other hand, you may be able to use the weight of the mountain to crush most of the rock, by starting at the base. 

Knowing the history of humanity, I expect they'd figure out a way to capture them. If nets don't work, use chains, if the chains break make them heavier. Many people would die trying, but eventually the technological advance would catch up with the dragons. Then it's just a matter of doing it a few more times, breeding them, and raising the young amongst humans. Voila, instant military domination. Why, you could write some sort of gritty seven-book epic fantasy series about it. 

Antagonic pleiotropy Some genes benefit us in early life (ie. before we usually have children), and are detrimental afterwards. These genes proliferate because they increase the chance of the individual having children, even though they can wreak havoc afterwards. So you could find one of these genes or invent one, something we all have, and then add a condition (virus, bacteria, radiation) that massively amplifies its effects. The young would get fitter, and the old would die off. Tyrabel's hormone answer is a specific case of this, since a large amount of testosterone is apparently detrimental later in life. 

The emperors (Caesar onwards, but specifically in the 10th century) actually were at the head of kings, in name at least; The Csars as well, (that title also stems from the Caesar-root). So Imperial Kingdoms were actually a thing, though the Emperor usually had some sort of country that he ruled alone, without going through an intermediate king, for exactly the reasons your Emperor will come to regret. 

Time flies like arrows because they are fast moving elongated objects that move axially. Slow moving stuff is incredibly big in the time-dimension, fast moving stuff is small in that aspect. (Think about measuring one of the three space-dimensions of a house, by walking by it, and calling out whether the house is beside you. One step: Still there. Two steps: Still there...... Thirty steps: now ist gone! Same for time: Go forward in time (meaning stand still and exist), and call out whether the object beside you is there: second 1: There. second 2: There. ... second 123134: Still there. It's a house. Gonna take awhile. Now sit there while an arrow flies by (and remember: Time flies are tiny, so they don't see so good. Stuff needs to be near them to appreciate it. No knobbly stuff either, moving knobbly stuff to a time creature is like a rapidly expanding and contracting monster. Scary. Nice, smooth arrows: Great. You sit near them, the view alters, soothing like staring at a tumble-dryer (which they like second best). Modern aluminium-shafts with paint on it? bliss. Practically like TV. 

A rod from god drops at a bit less than orbital speed (because it is "braked" out of orbit, in which it had, by definition, orbital speed). By m*v² we know that is a lot of energy, and we shudder in awe. But. The atmosphere will make sure, for any reasonably small object, that it hits ground with terminal velocity. For a heavy rod 10 meters long that may be Mach 10, but 3km/s is still much less than orbital velocity. This does not improve for rods that are somehow "shot" down, i.e. accelerated into an more eccentric orbit that intersects the atmosphere - that would just mean more energy to bleed. It is this atmospheric braking that essentially confines the rods to being sleek masses of tungsten - most other materials are either not dense enough (the rod needs to be sleek yet heavy), or not heat resistant enough (remember the awe-inspiring amount of energy fresh out of orbit? 80% or more of that will need to go away...). So you can be pretty sure there are no fins or guiding mechanisms on that thing. The trajectory will thus be a parabola. Know three points on a parabola, and you know the parabola. Of course there are winds and non-uniform air-densities and bla bla, but the travel time from intersect with atmosphere to ground will be on the order of 60 seconds, so not much time to interfere. All the shed energy is discarded in those 60 seconds, which means a huge value for energy/time, which is Power So there should be no real obstacle in detecting it. Allow for 2 seconds to discern from micro-meteorite. Blare alarm. Allow ten seconds for every soldier to lash themselves to the nearest truck by means of a specially designed leash. Everyone else just ducks and covers. The trucks have a (probably electric) sprint capability, and a guidance system that allows for "be quick or be dead" kind of path-choosing (better not be in front of one...) the trucks now accelerate away from impact, and eight seconds later they are at 100km/h, meaning they have covered about 100 meters. Every second more (and there should be about 40) will gain another 25 meters. Is that enough? Wikipedia has a 10 ton rod at about 10 ton TNT impact energy. That is a lot, until you realize it's not a bomb, its a tungsten rod travelling really fast. No air burst, not even ground burst. It's going to penetrate. It's a bunker-buster. You'd probably not like to be around (and even more probably not like to be around in a truck careening at 100km/h), but it's a lot less dangerous for ground troops than it is for bunkers. Assuming the impact-forecast was correct +-100m, and everybody was scattering radially from that point, the most out-of-luck crew will be 1000 meters from impact - it will suffice. It's not high-explosive, and it's not shedding that energy into the air or structures - it's shedding into the ground. About detection: you'll have to detect a glaring object, from a few hundred kilometers away, there should be no problem. You need a splash-down forecast 12 seconds into the atmosphere (Think, blare, lash), which should be enough for a rough estimate if you have your detection gear lateral from the flight-path. This means the detection gear travelling with your troops is actually protecting the people a few hundred km away, and theirs is protecting you. Good for morale... If your detection gear needs to be with the troops it's protecting, i.e. near ground zero, the best it will be able to do is predict a very long impact-ellipse, which can help to flee the area perpendicularly. Note that it is impossible to discern between a tungsten rod with, say steel, weak spots, and a usual rod from god. So the enemy now has a means of clearing a km²-sized area by sending a fake rod that breaks up and fireballs harmlessly 10km above target, while their ground troops move into the area unopposed.... Perhaps better to adopt a general duck and cover strategy, maybe splurge on some inflatable cocoons to mitigate the shock wave. 

Since this is a reversal of the classic AI deciding to destroy humanity for its own good, the solution is a reversal as well: If the kindest thing to do for humanity is to euthanize or cull it, the cruelest thing to do is not to interfere. 

Consider a species with two traits for which there is no evolutionary pressure. Let's say they're colored blue or red, and the color has absolutely no effect on their lives in any way. In that case, the proportion of red or blue creatures in the population would be a simple random process. A simple random process like this will eventually, purely by chance, lead to a situation where the whole populatation is one color, at which point the other color will be dead. The ability to have the other trait is simply lost forever. In your world, as you have painted it, there is pretty much no evolutionary pressure on any traits. If that situation is maintained, and the plants don't manage to diversify their own environment, they would converge towards a planet-wide monoculture. At that point the smallest microbe, solar flare, climate change etc would wipe the whole population out in no time. 

Imagination is a means to create art, but entertainment is its main purpose (together perhaps with expression). People found it entertaining to listen to music, look at paintings and watch plays. The entertainment value comes mostly from the imaginative aspects of escaping to another world, the joy of seeing somebody do something skillful, and the more intangible, abstract kind of pleasure we derive from things like music. The people in your world will probably not be able to enjoy fiction, since it requires the consumer to have some imagination as well. But they will differentiate between pleasant and unpleasant experiences. A good example is food. most likely they enjoy eating calorie-rich foods, due to their evolutionary benefit. Surplus energy would be spent on seeking out specific foods that they prefer, and people with enough food could trade these for other goods and services. Without imagination it would take a long time to discover how to bake something like a cake, but small progress could be made by random experimentation, and with enough free time, lengthy random experimentation would be rewarded, even though people would have no concept of working towards a thing that doesn't exist yet. Music might emerge in a similar way. People could not actively put sounds together to invent music, but they would find certain sounds more agreeable than others. They would surround themselves with things that naturally make pleasant sounds and might stumble across simple combinations of such objects. they would perhaps come up with something like a windchime. Finally, interesting visual patterns could emerge randomly by setting certain events in motion. Cutting the head of a chicken and letting it run around in white sand as it bleeds (sorry for the gory example) might produce a pleasant pattern. Once this is noticed, the process can be repeated to achieve the same effect. Most of their art would emerge in this kind of indirect fashion. They cannot imagine a goal and work towards it, but they would discover that when things are arranged in a certain way, the universe sometimes comes up with new things, which they can then recognize to have value. Once they have seen an example, they might be triggered to reproduce it, but they could only reproduce it by repeating the same steps. They would not think to paint the pattern in the sand themselves, but would keep slaughtering chickens in order to achieve the same pattern. 

So they were the cutest little critters around, and had already made massive profits for the company - one pet for every home was a target that seemed realistic - the Crispr/Cas-Sets for rapid personalization kits (genetic cures for variations in color, fluffyness and behaviour) were selling like wild, the special foodstuff that contained the precursors for wilder colors and glow-in-the-dark effects (could be done in vivo, but shhhh...) flew off the shelves, and would continue to do so, because the buggers were really tough and durable. Only problem: about one in a million humans had a harsh allergic reaction to them. So after the first lawsuits, the corporation was ready to pull the plug regardless, when a promising young scientist from the genetics department came up with an idea: While the allergenic factor, and even the brittleness of the older hair (designed and patented dust-away(r) to avoid whole hair uglying up couches) were too deeply ingrained in the genetic makeup to just remove from the DNA, it was a piece of cake to modify some eColi that would live inside its gut and release iRNA to specifically target the offending allergenic factor. The iRANa would bond with the RNA destined to be translated into the allergenic enzyme, no enzyme, no allergy. Profit. The modified eColi was rolled out as part of a yearly gene-bugfix (complementary). Was it the plan of the geneticist all along (she offed herself shortly after the first reports of malfunction popped up)? Was it a miscommunication with the third party contractor that did the splice on the eColi (what should have been separate for obvious resons was synthesized as one, disabled, sure, but now only one deletion away from becoming active)? Anyways, the eColi did not push the iRNA of the 1/million-allergen, they pushed the RNA of a 1/1 allergen of epic efficiency. Come into contact once, you'll be itchy and unwell. Come into contact a second time, without immune-dampeners turned to eleven, and you are a swollen, pus-dripping, retching pet owner for as long as it takes for you to succumb to your gut ripping itself apart. And the allergens are everywhere - it's not the hairs - its the broken-down-to-single-molecules hair-dust. Wrap yourself in molecular filters, or you are done. For a brief moment the tide was stemmed by immunosupressants, but as the stockpiles dwindled, normal sickness jumped on the defenseless, and it soon became clear that only [obscure country] that had never imported the pets because of a licensing spat with the corporation, would survive in any shape at all...
