It is usually the case that this requirement is equivalent to $A_{m}$ having P for all maximal ideals $m$ of $A$. I was wondering which (if any) are the strongest/most interesting local properties $P$ of a commutative ring that do not satisfy the second equivalence. Similarly, I would like to know the strongest/most interesting non-local properties P that are true at all localizations at $p$. That is to say, what are the most interesting properties P of $A$ such that: 

You can prove that the two theories are, in fact, equivalent. By induction (NB: 'meta-induction') on the number of parameters, we can reduce the claim to the case where you have a theory $T$ with the usual induction schema and a theory $T'$ that is an extension of $T$ by a one-parameter induction schema. So assume $T$ and $T'$ are not equivalent. This implies that there is a model $\mathcal{M} \vDash T'$ and a two-place open sentence $\phi(x,y)$ such that $$\mathcal{M} \vDash \phi(0,\beta) \wedge (\forall x (\phi(x,\beta) \rightarrow \phi(x+1,\beta))) $$ but also, $$\mathcal{M} \nvDash \forall x \phi(x,\beta)$$ for some $\beta \in \mathcal{M}$. But note now that the above is equivalent to $$ \mathcal{M} \vDash \exists y (\phi(0,y) \wedge (\forall z (\phi(z,y) \rightarrow \phi(z+1,y))) \wedge \neg \forall z \phi(z,y) $$ and if you call this last sentence $S$ then you get that $S \wedge \phi ' (x)$ violates the usual induction-schema, where $\phi ' (x)$ is the one-place open sentence we get by by closing $y$ under the existential quantifier in $S$. That is to say we have $S \wedge \phi ' (0)$ and $ \forall x (S \wedge \phi ' (x) \rightarrow S \wedge \phi ' (x+1))$ but not $\forall x S \wedge \phi ' (x)$. But that is a contradiction since $\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $T$. Hence the two theories are equivalent. 

Here is my question : Suppose you have a simple (analytic) closed curve $\gamma$ in an open simply connected domain $\Omega \neq \mathbb{C}$. Does there exist a conformal bijection $f : \Omega \rightarrow U \subset \mathbb{C}$, such that $\gamma$ is sent to the unit circle $S^1$ (the unit disc $D$ would then be contained in $U$) ? The Riemann mapping theorem tells you that you can find a conformal map from the interior of $\gamma$ to $D$, and the conformal geometry of an annulus tells you that you can also find a conformal map from the annulus $\Omega - int(\gamma)$ to an annulus $A(r_1,r_2) = \{z \in \mathbb{C} | r_1 < |z| < r_2 \}$. But this does not answer the question... Note that in the question I don't ask for the open set $U$ to be bounded by a circle (this would clearly be too restrictive). This question is somehow related to a previous question I asked, but I think this one is quite different though. The answer must be well-know, but I can not find it anywhere - neither from myself. 

I suspect his terminology might be idiosyncratic, so I'll point out that by an $\omega$-model he means "a model of set theory in which the natural numbers are ordered as they are 'supposed to be'; that is, the sequence of 'natural numbers' of the model is an $\omega$-sequence." My first (not-so-interesting) question is this: 

Now to the title question. In his "proof" (quotation marks because I'm not yet sure whether it is a proof or a plausibility argument) of the Theorem, after reducing the statement to something equivalent, he writes: 

Here is my question : I have a harmonic function $h$ on the open unit disc in $D \subset \mathbb{C}$, such that $\iint_D e^{2h} d\lambda(z) \leq A < \infty$ ($d\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{C}$). Can one have an upper bound of $e^h$ near the boundary of the disc ? With elementary tools (mean value property for harmonic functions + Jensen's inequality with the exponential map) I can only obtain $e^{h(z)} \leq \frac{C^{te}}{d(z,S^1)}$ ($d(z,S^1)$ is the distance between $z$ and the boundary of $D$), but I would like something better (for example, $e^{h(z)} \leq \frac{C^{te}}{d(z,S^1)^{1/2}}$ or something like that would be nice). If not, can one have an upper bound on the integral of $e^h$ over a ray passing through 0 ($\int_0^1 e^{h(r)} dr$ for example) ? Thank you! 

The Heisenberg-Weyl algebra or the Weyl algebra or the algebra of the Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR) is generated by the $p,q$ generators subject to the relation $$ [q, p] = i \hbar I \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1) $$ This is isomporphic to the algebra of the OP under the "change of base": $$ A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(q-ip), \ \ \ \ B=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(q+ip) $$ A first simple and well known result, in the sense of a non-go theorem, can be derived by direct inspection of the commutation relation: 

You can prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using Sylow 2-subgroups. The sketch of the proof is as follows: 

Please don't get put off by the length, all the questions are quite simple, but given the quasi-mathematical context I tried to be precise with the formulation. The more mathematically interesting title question (and the one that's most important for my purposes) is the last one, so if anything please take a look at the end. Here goes. In his paper Models and Reality (1980) pg. 468 ($URL$ Hilary Putnam states and proves the following theorem: 

This follows easily by a trace argument on both sides of (1) (or of $[A,B]=1$) as long as Planck's constant $\hbar$ is different than zero. So, from the beginning we have to focus in infinite dimensional representations of the Weyl algebra and since the problem is motivated by physical considerations it is natural to consider its generators acting on Hilbert spaces. An old result (see 1, 2) tells us that when dealing with representations of (1) in Hilbert spaces, the generators $q$ and $p$ cannot both be bounded: at least one of them has to be unbounded. Given that a self-adjoint (and thus symmetric), unbounded operator in a Hilbert space cannot be defined on the whole of the space but only on a dense subspace of it (this is a direct consequence of the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem), one can see that the above remark poses delicate questions on the domains of the above operators (and thus the representations of the Weyl algebra) and at the same time underlines the importance of the use of unbounded operators in the formulation of QM. Initiating from the above remark, Stone and von Neumann studied the integrated forms of $p,q$ i.e. the unitary, one-parameter groups $$ \begin{array}{cccccc} U(s) = exp(-i s p) & & & & & V(t) = exp(-i t q) \end{array} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2) $$ The above expressions are well defined because $p, \ q$ are self-adjoint (see 2,3). $V(t)$ acts on $f(x)$ by multiplication with $exp(-itx)$, while $U(s)$ acts by horizontal translations (shifts) of $f(x)$ i.e. $$ \begin{array}{cccccc} (U(s)f)(x) = f(x-s) & & & & & (V(t)f)(x) = e^{-itx}f(x) \end{array} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3) $$ for any square integrable complex function of a real variable, i.e. for any $f(x) \in L_{2}(- \infty, \infty)$. The operators $U(s)$, $\ \forall s \in \mathbb{R}$ and $V(t)$, $\ \forall t \in \mathbb{R}$, are unitary and thus bounded. Their domain is now the whole of the Hilbert space (and not only a dense subspace as was the case for the $p,q$ generators of the Weyl algebra). Furthermore, $U(s)$, $V(t)$ satisfy $$ U(s)V(t) = e^{ist} V(t)U(s) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (4) $$ for all $s \in \mathbb{R}$ and for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$. (4) is frequently called the integrated form of the Weyl relations or the integrated form of the CCR. The Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem, determines conditions -the main one is (4)- which guarantee the uniqueness of the representation (3) (and not directly the uniqueness of the usual Fock representation of $p,q$). In other words, it tells us that, given the operators $U(s), \ V(t)$ on $L_{2}(- \infty, \infty)$, satisfying (4) (plus some technicalities on the domains) then their action is unitarily equivalent to the representation (2), (3). There have been lots of studies (and references) on the Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem, its origins, its extensions, its descendants and on the exact relation between the Weyl generators and their integrated forms. If you are interested in such aspects, I could provide further references on such topics. Remark 1: Formally, the transition between the CCR (1) and their integrated form (3), (4) can be understood as follows: $\bullet$ If we start from the CCR (1) together with (2) written in power series: $$ \begin{array}{cccc} U(s) = exp(-i s p) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-isp)^{n}}{n!} & & & V(t) = exp(-i t q) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-i t q)^{n}}{n!} \\ \\ \end{array} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (5) $$ then one can deduce the integrated form of the CCR (3), (4) by applying the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula. $\bullet$ For the converse, the CCR (1) follow formally on taking $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t \partial s}$ of (4) at $s=t=0$. However, this description is rather an indication than a strict proof of equivalence between the Weyl algebra and its integrated form: The reason is that $p, \ q$ are unbounded operators and hence the power series expressions cannot be valid on the whole of the space. Consequently, in general, the integrated form of the Weyl relations is not equivalent (at least not in some obvious way) with the Weyl relations themselves (i.e. the CCR). Remark 2: For the case of the infinite degrees of freedom Weyl algebra, there is no analogue -at least to my knowledge- of the Stone-von Neumann theorem (its applicability is limited to the finite generators case). On the contrary, it has been shown (see 4) that, the CCR admit infinitely many, non-equivalent, irreducible representations on a Hilbert space, which are in bijection with the set of real numbers. For interesting examples of irreducible CCR representations, which are inequivalent to the usual Fock space representation, one can look at books on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics such as: 5, vol. II, p.251-252. References: 

Suppose you have a riemannian surface $(\Sigma,g)$, and an open simply-connected set $U \subset \Sigma$. You know that you can find isothermal coordinates - that is a map $\varphi : U \rightarrow D$ ($D \subset \mathbb{C}$ stands for the unit disk) for which the metric reads $g = e^{2u(z)} |dz|^2$. $(U,g)$ is then isometric to $(D,d_g)$. The question is the following : can one compare the distance $d_g$ on $D$, and the Euclidean distance $d_{euc}$ ? By comparing the two distances, I mean one of the following two inequalities : $C_1 {|z-z'|}^{C_2} \leq d_g(z,z') \leq C_3 {|z-z'|}^{C_4}$. The answer is "no" in general (with no difficulty you can find a function $u$ on the disc $D$ such that no such bound is possible). So a more precise question is : given the open domain $U \subset \Sigma$, can one find a map $\varphi$ such that there exists such a bound ? So the question can be thought as "can we find isothermal coordinates in which we control the metric" (in the sense stated above). Such things are classical (in any dimension) with harmonic coordinates : if one controls the curvature (in some sense...) and the injectivity radius, one can find a nice (harmonic) coordinate system in which the metric is controlled (in some sense again...). I'm wondering if this kind of things can exists for isothermal coordinates. 

I want to prove that the cocommutative finite dimensional Hopf algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero are group algebras (for some finite group) and that the commutative f.d. Hopf algebras (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero) are dual to group Hopf algebras (for some finite group). More precisely, I want to prove the following proposition: 

See also this, which is a more modern work, in the form of a book, discussing (non-commutative) geometrical ideas related to supersymmetry although from a more -imo- phenomenological viewpoint (emphasizing the supersymmetric standard model, supersymmetry breaking, elementary particle interactions , etc).
