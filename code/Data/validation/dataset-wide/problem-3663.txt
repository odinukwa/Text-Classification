Check out Neanderthal No More - The complete guide to fixing your caveman posture! by Eric Cressey and Mike Robertson. It's available on T-Nation and cited all over the web. It deals directly with your (and my) issue. The 4 part T-Nation version has lots of Q&A from readers. @Grohlier gives a very succinct summary of this article which has tons of anatomy drawings and exercises photos. Some of the exercises (face pulls and pull throughs) were new even to me. I would like to add the following for "my question is - is doing deadlifts and squats bad for me and my back?". They are fine BUT form is super critical and you must work within the range of motion you have - e.g. you might not be able to get to parallel on the squat for a while. Can you raise your arms above your head without arching backwards? If you can't, you may end up with a very high bar squat that will end up making you round your lower back if you try to break parallel. The deadlift, squat, and bench press are so fundamental that you should get Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength to get all the biomechanics right. Possibly, Rippetoe alone might do it for you if you have a partner to check your form and your issue isn't too severe. For sure, study the Cressey & Robertson piece, it worked for me and I believe it is sound scientifically. 

Look at any classic bodybuilding book or DVD and it will say free weights are superior to cables (and machines) for muscular hypertrophy. Joe Weider and Arnold Schwarzenegger are two famous proponents of this idea. Their claim is that humans have evolved to work against gravity and free weights provide a natural gravitational force, while cables do not. I understand how machines are inferior because they don't work stabilizer muscles, but I don't understand how this logic proves cables are suboptimal. A) Evolution Who says humans have evolved to get bigger muscles from working against gravity? If anything, technological advances have made humans work less against gravity over the centuries. We do not toil on the farm like our forefathers. We now have cars, computers, and robots to do heavy lifting for us. B) Contradiction to overload principle Isn't the key to hypertrophy to subject the muscles to ever-increasing unusual stress, thereby making them adapt to this new stress? Bodybuilders know that doing the same routine over and over make their muscles become complacent. Since cables provide a force that is unlike the gravity we deal with every waking moment of our lives, then wouldn't cables stress the muscles more than free weights? 

I'm surprised no one has mentioned supersets, an ancient and honorable practice in which you do a set of one exercise then immediately do a set of another, rest and repeat. Supersetting 3 exercises is not uncommon. One kind of superset is the leg extension - lat pulldown type. It is done for time efficiency since you get to skip a rest period. Is your performance reduced? Probably. For sure if you're not in great shape or not using steroids. But if today's workout is chest and you do all your benching first, so what? The oddest kind of superset is the dumbbell curl - lat pulldown type. Here you're trying to take your biceps out of the back work, or paradoxically, you're hoping the pulldowns will extract the last bit of bicep strength. The most sophisticated superset is something I recently learned from Eric Cressey's Show and Go where an exercise is paired with a stretch or mobility exercise. As you can see, this is an advanced approach in every sense. All your energy systems need to be well developed and you need to know the primary and secondary muscles used by each exercise. If you're asking the question, you probably aren't ready, but the fact that you came up with it shows a creative mind that will take you far. 

It is generally accepted that the optimal rep range for muscular hypertrophy is around 6-10 reps. And it is also generally accepted that after 3 minutes of rest muscles will recuperate all the energy they can possibly get. (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Joe Weider) Do muscles still achieve optimal hypertrophy when they're tired and they hit that range? Let me give an example. I do 8 reps of 135 lb to failure on the bench press. I take a brief rest, about 30 seconds. To accomodate my current energy level, I must lower the weight to 95 lb to reach failure at 8 reps. Is this second set still achieving maximum hypertrophy? Or must I rest long enough to use 135 lb x 8 reps again? Schwarzenegger, in his Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, has instructed never to rest long enough to completely recuperate. His reason was to not let the muscle get cold and to feel a better "pump". However, Weider refutes Schwarzenegger's advocacy of the "pump". In one of Weider's videos (4:29), Ms. Olympia 1982 Rachel McLish says: 

"can I expect my wrists to gain in proportion" - from a body building perspective small wrists can make your forearm muscles look huge - you don't want proportion. Small hips and ankles (and wide shoulders) are great for body builders. Do hammer curls to build big forearms leading into small wrists. My small wrists took quite a beating in sumo, but wrist curls and heavy deadlifts put an end to wrist strains. I no longer needed to tape up, but my wrists didn't grow. Top competitive judo players develop 'fat' hands and wrists from constant gripping and sumo wrestlers develop 'fat' insteps from gripping the earthen floor with their toes. It's tendon development, but these people are gripping for hours a day, 5-6 days a week for years. My strength coach was a tall guy with big joints who lifted awesome poundages and never looked very muscular. Lots of long muscle spread over a big frame. 

When you have diarrhea, what portions of the food is excreted? Does only the poisoned portions become excreted or do the whole stomach contents get excreted? Here is a practical example: For your post workout shake, you blend whey protein with milk. You did not know the milk was expired. After drinking the shake, you get a stomach ache and have diarrhea. What exactly was excreted in the diarhea? Did only the milk get excreted and not the whey? Or did both get excreted? In the latter case, one would need to eat more protein, but in the former case, you don't need to worry because the protein is still in your system. 

Practical Programming for Strength Training by Rippetoe & Kilgore is written for strength and conditioning coaches including power lifting teams so it applies to athletes in strict training programs. In a section called "Going Backward: Detraining" he says that strength persists much longer than aerobic VO2 max...ability to generate force drops in a few weeks...drops at about 15% per year...returning after 2-6 months, the trainee should drop one level e.g. an intermediate lifter should restart with novice programs (he defines these terms strictly) until his strength returns to pre-layoff levels, which will occur faster than the time it took to become intermediate (this is true for size as well). He strongly cautions coaches/trainers to not "get greedy" in that even an athlete who's just turned intermediate has a neuromuscular system far more efficient than the untrained individual and though it's weakened it is still able to work the detrained muscles harder than they can handle. This is what Dave, FredrikD, and YYY have already said in their comments, I just wanted to put a reference in an answer for those who want to pursue these issues further. Interestingly for me at least, he then goes on to discuss the returning 'retired' lifter, someone who's taken a year or more off. Here he suggests restarting with novice level programs regardless of pre-layoff level. 

Background Weightlifting creates micro-tears in the muscle. Protein and other nutrients repair the tears so the muscle grows back stronger and larger. Question How is muscle repair affected by a caloric deficit during a weight training program? I can think of these three scenarios: 

I've heard the concept of "genetic potential" thrown around when referring to bodybuilding. They say that people are hardwired to reach certain size. I have the following questions regarding this elusive concept. Scientific validity Have scientists singled out the gene that determines the genetic potential a person's muscles? Or is the concept purely based off observation from the bodybuilding community? Plateau How can you differentiate between hitting a plateau and hitting your genetic potential? Should a person who's been unsuccessfully trying to break a plateau for over a year give up because it's not really a plateau but rather a genetic brick wall? Hard Limit? Is the limit a hard limit? For example, the gene says one person's upper arm circumference will not exceed 26 inches no matter what. Or is it a ballpark limit? That is, a person will struggle to get past the suggested limit, but will have an exponentially harder time going past that limit. 

Rippetoe (of Starting Strength) has book of essays entitled Strong Enough? . Maybe you are for your current needs. I gave all the answers an up, they're all good. One thing I might add is that the plank is very easy to do kind of wrong. Has anyone put a yardstick on you to check your 'plankiness'? 

Because body building isn't an exact science like bridge building (and even that has gone horribly wrong more than once), you're going to have to keep a food diary and a workout diary. The food diary tracks calories, protein, (and slip ups) and your weight. The workout diary tracks your strength and work capacity and aerobics. You can start with WebMD calculators for BMI and minimum calorie intake to maintain weight and a good workout program emphasizing big lifts. But these are only starting points. You need real data to determine what works - and remember that things will change as you go. 

Why does he change his hours of sleep depending on the season? By sleeping 8-9 hours in the off-season, Jay Cutler is somewhere in the "long sleepers" range according to this poster. Is he putting on unnecessary fat as the poster says or does the poster only apply to sedentary people? 

You can increase the strength of the serratus anterior by doing pullovers. I agree with some of other responses, saying that other muscles are indirectly related to punching. The tricep and chest are probably also just as important as the serratus anterior. 

I saw some rock climbers train in my gym. They were really wiry with big chests. By wiry I mean small but highly defined arms and legs. This was in Japan, so maybe it's genetic or they were professional competitors, but people said they were training for max strength at the lowest possible weight. Starting Strength can really pack on the pounds for a young (under 25) novice lifter. I'd say drink lots of milk, lift heavy and get big and strong while you can - it can't hurt (unless you're rock climbing). Seriously, a power lifter might be able to climb higher than his conditioning will let him climb down. As you become less novice in both activities you may have to make some hard choices. But nothing is set in stone (unless you're rock climbing).
