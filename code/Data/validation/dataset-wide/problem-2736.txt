Traditionalism, the philosophy of Edmund Burke which states that there is great wisdom embedded in our social institutions and culture, so we should be careful before we try to tamper with them Libertarianism, the philosophy of John Locke which says that people have fundamental negative rights that the government should not infringe 

Knowledge is traditionally defined as justified true belief: in order for S to know P, S must believe P, P must be true, and S must be justified in believing P. Now this definition has been criticized by invoking various "Gettier cases", supposed examples of justified true belief which are not knowledge. The defenders of a "justified true belief" understanding of knowledge have responded by showing that these Gettier cases are not really cases of justified true belief, by clarifying exactly what constitutes a justification. Here is the philosopher Robert Nozick's theory of justification, according to this Wikipedia article: 

If something has a natural desire for something, then that desire cannot be in vain, i.e. it must in principle be possible to fulfill that desire. All things have a natural desire to exist. Humans have knowledge of eternal truths about existence. Thus humans have a natural desire to exist forever. Therefore, humans exist forever. 

These two strands were merged into the ideology we call American liberalism by John Dewey and his followers, who argued that we needed a broader conception of liberty than the one maintained by laissez-faire negative-rights libertarians. The key idea can be summed up in a quote from Anatole France: "In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread." Basically, the idea is that the freedom to starve because you have no food is not a meaningful freedom at all, because it does not maximize your autonomy or allow your to realize your potential, which were important goals in classical liberalism. Thus Dewey argued that we should recognize positive liberty as well as negative liberty, meaning that e.g. just as we ought to recognize a right to live without someone killing you, we similarly ought to recognize a right to live without dying due to lack of food. Thus American liberalism advocates that the government should play some role in the economy in order to give people autonomy and enable them to pursue their own happiness, along the lines of the "responsiveness" part of the Progressive philosophy. Thus Americans liberals still try to achieve the goals of classical liberalism, but they sometimes do it through Progressive means. (This is akin to how, as I discuss in my other answer, American conservatism tries to achieve the goals of traditionalism, but often through libertarian means.) There's one other way that American liberalism differs from classical liberalism: classical liberals took a deontological perspective on liberty, viewing personal autonomy and the pursuit of happiness as things that are inherently worthy of being promoted, regardless of what they lead to. American liberalism, on the other hand, because it emerged partly from Progressivism, tends to take a more utilitarian perspective on such things, viewing autonomy merely as a means to an end, the end being increasing the happiness of as many people as possible. The liberal understanding of utilitarianism is perhaps best understood through the work of John Rawls, who proposed a thought experiment along roughly these lines: suppose that you're a soul waiting to be born, but you don't know which body you're going to be born into and what experiences that body is going to have. But before you're born, you have the opportunity to design how society and government should be. How should you design it in order to maximize your chances of having a good life? Well, you don't know what desires you're going to have, but whatever they are, you're probably going to want them fulfilled, so you would want a society that as much as possible allows people to pursue their own happiness. And you may end up being born in utter poverty that may prevent you from being happy, or you may start off being wealthy but then you may suffer calamities like disease and natural disasters, so assuming you're risk averse (as humans tend to be in most circumstances), you'd want the government to have a safety net to shelter you from such risks. So that's where the basic contours of the liberal position emerge. Finally, let me mention something about foreign policy. The Progressive presidents advocated a very interventionist foreign policy, since they were motivated by the desire to help people as much as possible, even people abroad. Liberals still share some of this impulse, and are willing to support limited American military intervention in circumstances of extreme humanitarian crisis. But mostly their foreign policy views were taken from classical liberalism, so they they're antiwar for the most part. EDIT: Yuval Levin has just written a book which argues that the positive rights vision of liberalism originated not with Dewey in the early twentieth century as I suggested, but rather in the late 1700's with Thomas Paine, one of America's founding fathers. Levin argues that the modern American left-right divide originated in the debate in America and England over the French Revolution. Paine was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution, because he thought that government is an institution deliberately created by people to sageguard their individual liberty, and so it could be overthrown whenever the people thought it wasn't doing a good job. On the other hand, Edmund Burke, a predecessor to modern conservatism, saw government as an institution that grew organically as a tradition, and that we should be suspicious of making changes to it just because individuals in the current generation happen to object to it. In any case, Paine's philosophy of individualism led him to believe that an individual can only realize his full potential if he's not constrained by material want, so he believed in the government providing basic necessities to everyone. Thus, Levin argues, the early twentieth century Progressive movement was merely reinventing the wheel. 

I'm not sure about your definition of the theory of evolution. You can find plenty of them on internet, so I won't copy them here and try to give my feeling about it : Information about living entity are in the genome. The important thing is that gene can change, mutate, resulting in differences in some element of the species. If the mutation give an advantage to one individual, he is more likely to have children, and will give the new gene to them. After several generation these gene might become common, and share by a majority of the species, resulting in some evolution. But these process take a really long time. So in my opinion it doesn't mean nothing bad will ever happen to a species. Being able to feel some fear can help you to survive, and not be eaten by a predator. Still, to much fear can be bad for you. Some aggressiveness might help you to survive in a dangerous world. Also a individual that really want to have sex, even at the cost of raping other in the species have more probability to reproduce and have children. All these behavior might not be adapted now, but if some gene of aggressiveness are present in the population they can't disappear really fast. My explanation would be : mankind has redefined really fast the environment, faster than evolution could do. People with bad behavior due to gene can still reproduce and have children that will share these gene. Evolution doesn't guarantee that people will be good and nice to each other. It just selects individual able to survive and reproduce. Being a social animal goes further than that. We are able to make people survive even if they have small defects. Evolution is just a logical consequence of the diversity of gene and mutation. 

There was a moment in France, where all the philosopher tried to use some psychoanalysis in their works. Lacan was one of the really, most famous psychoanalyst, and was known to be really difficult to read. Actually, a lots of peoples start to speak like him, and a lot of philosophers were really influenced by this. One of the main point was to use a lot of references to science and a lot of analogies. I am trying to give you a decent, not opinion based answer but it's difficult. If the first comment talks about obscurantism it's not meaningless. Some people started to criticize the postmodern philosopher. Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont published a book, "impostures intellectuelles" (intellectual imposture, or fashionable nonsense), which ... well the title says it all. They receive some supports. Michel Onfray also published some works against psychoanalysis, for reasons closely related to obscurantism. I have some doubts for some of this author. I don't think all of the work they have done is bad, or not interesting. For what I understand it was some sort of fashion, a way to act, to appear smart. Onfray : Twilight of an idol (Cr√©puscule d'une idole) Sokal Bricmont : Fashionable nonsense / Intellectual imposture (Impostures intellectuelles) I just found also that there is a wikipedia page on this topic : $URL$ Apparently Noam Chomsky is cited here. By the way I don't know if you read them in french or a translation, but even for french people it's really hard to read. 

I agree that it doesn't seems to be taken seriously. One of the reason might be that there is kind of an evolution, from polytheism to monotheism. It would feel like going back in time, to an idea that has been abandoned at some point. More than that, the fact that there is a lot of different traditions in it, a lot of ways to be wiccan or neopagan makes it harder to say it is a religion. Maybe also, the fact that it's sometimes related to magical practice, and some sorts of weird rituals makes it more look like it's not just a religion. I usually see books of wicca in "esoteric" category. Some people might consider that the main purpose is not the faith in those gods, but rather the ideology of living in small society without following some rules (at least for wicca), or making secret societies ... Another point is that the resurgence is recent, and the more than two thousand years history that it carries is not obvious. There is no continuity with the old civilization. In this regards, wicca is very young and it's difficult to have a good feedback on what it really is. 

I don't know if it really answers your question but in physic there is something that might illustrate this. When you look at electromagnetic charge, it can be either positive or negative, so you have some kind of direct opposition. You have two possibilities, and when you add an electric charge to an opposite charge of the same intensity you are left with an electrically neutral object (like an neutral atom made of electrons and protons of charge -e and +e). But when you look at strong interaction, the quarks can carry three different charges, and they are called color charges (it's not like real life color, but it's a good analogy). In a proton for example, you have three quarks, and they have three different colors : blue, red and green, and the result is a "white" proton, which means that the proton is neutral in regards of the strong interaction. So we could say that the opposite of one color charge is the sum of the other two. The cool part is that this is how every proton and neutron are made, so this example is everywhere around us. Actually, you have also anticolor. For example, pions are light particles made of only one quark and one antiquark, and they can carry for examples red-antired or blue-antiblue, so that, again, the result is neutral particle. The assumption here is that the opposite is defined by : the summation over opposite charges is zero. And I feel sorry that all the answers are either about math or physics.
