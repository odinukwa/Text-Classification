They clearly don't correspond to any German ranks, Wermacht or Waffen SS that I can see here. $URL$ $URL$ The biggest giveaway that it's not Wermacht or Waffen SS though - is the colour $URL$ 

However, Ottoman reforms were incomplete. In areas with Christian majorities, authorities often supported abuse as a way to keep Christians in check. This led to a number of crises such as the 1860 Druze-Maronite conflict, & the Cretan Revolt. Geopolitical stresses - the great power element There were geopolitical motivations as well. The Russians and the Ottomans had been in conflict from the 16th right up to the 20th Century. In fact, this rivalry is still evident today, although in past months tensions have cooled. Russia and Turkey shared a long border in the Caucuses and this caused some friction. The Russian-Ottoman conflicts were one of the longest running series of conflicts in Europe. After 300 years of living under threat from Ottoman domination, the Eastern Question was opened after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca marked the retreat of the Ottomans, and granting Russia access to the Black Sea. The Eastern question was how would the balance of power established at the Treaty of Vienna in 1815 be maintained. Treaty of Vienna. Russian wanted a free hand to expand into Southern Europe, as well as access to warm water ports in the Black Sea, and ostensibly, access to the Mediterrenean. The British were determined to forestall this, which formed part of the 'drift' to the Crimean War. The Concert of Europe began to completely come apart after the Unified Germany defeated Austria, then France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 (an event that would also play no small part in shaping events leading up to the First World War). In order to keep France contained on the continent, Bismarck created the Three Emperor's League. To counter this, France fomented uprisings and supported indepdence movements, including in the Balkans - Russian countered this by using the emerging Pan-Slavic ideal - that all Slavs should be united under Russian leadership. The Stew comes to a boil From 1804 - 1817 Serbia revolted at Ottoman rule for a number of factors: The Serbian Revolution 

It's important to consider that the Japanese like pretty much everyone else apart from a few German generals and Fuller considered the tank to be an infantry support weapon. Tanks weren't really deployed en masse primarily due to the difficulties of terrain. The tropical rainforests didn't really lend itself to large scale wars of movement. However that's not to say that the Pacific theatre was entirely absent of large scale tank deployments and a war of movement. For example in the Malayan campaign, the Japanese deployed around 200 tanks against the Allies. This campaign displayed a lot of operational emphasis on speed. $URL$ What's also interesting to note is that the Japanese were able to conduct encircling movements not by land but by sea. In the initial invasion the Japanese did focus on small scale envelopments and combined arms tactics: 

So it's quite likely that Caesar ciphers could have been at use despite the possession of more sophisticated ciphers at the time for reasons of expediency. However the reasons seem to be much more familiar than that: 

1900 presents one dominant challenge, time. 54 years after the last land grants were given. There wouldn't be a lot of original deed holders alive by 1900. The ranchos were intended to be used for farming. Once split up that use might have been lost. This would in some cases invalidate the property thanks to efforts to take the land, or descendents would simply have no use for the land anymore. Obviously you know beyond squatters and the issue of getting government recognition of property, Californios weren't a heavy currency society and so much of what wealth they had was in property. To adapt to the changing culture they would have had to sell land to get cash. Many did. This was far more likely where larger cities were developing. There would be immense pressure to sell as the value of the land was rising. There was also the issue of property taxes. If one owned a large parcel of land in a less populated area, even this steady pressure of having to continuously pay the state government year after year for the land probably contributed to sales. The original Spanish vision for the land was to give it to the Native Americans that had come to work the missions, but the Mexican government instead gave the land to Californios. As it became apparent that there was substantial interest by America to take California, the local government began handing out numerous grants in hopes of gaining loyalty. Not only to Californios, but to all kinds of people who lived in California with Mexican citizenship. The vast majority of all land grants were given in the last few years of Mexican California. This rushed effort left many properties ill-defined or without substantial legal documentation and made it easy for the US government to reject the claims. Every property I've looked at seems to have fallen to descendants or others decades before 1900, and where descendents got the land, few didn't sell their property before 1900. I have found instances where subsequent purchasers held onto the land until today in their families, but not the original families, and there today seems to exist only 2 original land grants in single private ownership, one of them has remained essentially undeveloped. Salvador Vallejo, Mariano Vallejo's younger brother, had Rancho Napa and Salvador, he sold most of the land from both ranchos relatively early on. However he kept a personal area for his home which he willed to his son Ignacio upon his death. Ignacio lived on the land until at least 1919 when the house burned down. Rancho Boca de Santa Monica was given in part to Francisco Marquez. While portions of it were sold through the years, much of it stayed in the family past 1900, and in fact a portion is still in Marquez family ownership today. So there were some instances, probably more I haven't found. But not likely many. So many natural and artificial challenges were presented. I found this very informative searching for information. Amazed at the lengths people had to go through to keep any land, and the lengths others went to take it. One interesting instance I found was for Rancho Suscol. Originally granted to Mariano Vallejo, he had sold it to his son-in-law John Frisbie. Frisbie then subdivided it and sold it to more people. Then the US government declared the original claim invalid. This opened the land to the Homestead Act allowing people to move in and claim land for occupying it. Frisbie didn't give up however, and appealed to an older law that allowed previous owners to buy the land from the government before homesteaders could claim it. This failed too. But he had enough support to get a new law passed just for this one property, The Suscol Act which allowed him to buy the land and maintain ownership. However by this time the attempted homesteaders were beginning to make the same claims he did originally, claiming to be the lawful original owners citing the same act he did. It ended up being a US Supreme Court case, which ruled in favor of Frisbie and the homesteaders were evicted. So it took an act of Congress AND a US Supreme Court ruling just to save one Rancho in California that was being subdivided anyway. 

Well we can infer a couple of things regarding Russian cryptography in the early 20th century (the inter-war period.) The Austro-Hungarians were able to break the Russians version of a Viginere Cipher (A poly-alphabetic substitution cipher) during the First World War to great effect. What Wikipedia does tell us about Russia's level of encryption sophistication during World War One is that they were at least capable of developing poly-alphabetic ciphers. 

The lines on the Western Front were not by any stretch of the imagination "short". The Western Front ran all the way from Switzerland to the Atlantic Ocean. Side attacks? Well the Race to the Sea ($URL$ was in fact an attempt by each Army to outflank each other until a continuous front stretched across all of France. 

So what we know that the schemas in Soviet Russia at the time would be some variants of both poly-alphabetic (e.g Viginere Ciphers) and mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers; as well as codewords which are not ciphers per se, but are forms of encryption. However it is also important to realise that historically commanders may have used simpler ciphers or codes at the local level in order to avoid transmitting in the clear. Whilst the Soviets may have possessed more sophisticated ciphers than a simple Caesar shift (a monoalphabetic substitution ) - they may not have had time, inclination or expertise to encrypt a message fully. Encrypting a message poorly can result in the breaking of an entire cryptographic system - by exposing the underlying logic used to cipher the message. It was quite common in World War One for soldiers to send a message in the clear rather than encrypt them if they did not have the time to do so. 

Technology also played a part. Warplanners on both sides made faulty assumptions that led to miscalculation when the war started. For example: 

The Russians also viewed the Balkan states as a buffer against Austrian influence. This is why they supported Serbia in the weeks leading up to the outbreak of World War One. The Tsars had also long held designs on Constantinople and the Bosphorus, which would further serve as a bulwark against incursions from powers like Britain, whom was its greatest geopolitical rival. The Russians also slowly dismembered Ottoman control of South-Eastern Europe as part of their aims to reducing the Ottoman Empire to that of a petty vassal state. Thus we can conclude that Russian Balkans policy was driven by a goal of territorial expansionism and imperial ambition. This is a policy that continues to this day. 

Was Jesus unique? If he was this would then lead to the conclusion that in fact there were no other messianic apocalypse preachers such as himself. We however, know that in fact, if such "messiahs" were indeed very common. Palestine in the first century CE was in fact awash with messianic apocalypse cults. There were were in fact many of these sects existing at the time. That Christianity arose in such a period is indeed no surprise. Carrier describes it eloquently as " yet another messiah cult in the midst of a fad for such cults." Josephus records at least four such other messianic cults and how widely popular they are: "The Samaritan gathered followers and said he would reveal the lost relics of the Temple on Mount Gezirim", which strongly implies that the Samaritans believed in the imminent arrival of a Messiah at this time. "Thuedas gathered followers and claimed he would part the Jordan - another act of obvious messianic significance", Joshua (the original "Jesus") also miraculously parted the Jordan before his conquest of Israel. Josephus also mentions "The Egyptian" who preached from the Mountain of Olives and claimed he would topple the walls of Jerusalem (another allusion to the Joshua symbolism). Preaching from the Mount of Olives also held messianic symbolism. Another 'imposter' mentioned by Josephus (code for : false messiah) gathered followers and promised them salvation if they followed him into the wilderness - a strong reference to Moses and teh Temptation in Exodus. John the Baptist could also be considered yet another messianic figure - who preached the arrival of the Messiah (and by extension, the end times that such a figure would herald). Acts also makes reference to Simon Magus, who is depicted as a messianic pretender. The Dead Sea Scrolls attest to several such cults existing at the time, especially in Qumran where the keepers of the scroll were already expecting the imminent end of the world. Philo of Alexandria also wrote a text adapting the apocalyptic expectations of the time. The Gospels also assume that messianic fervour was so high at the time that many people expected Elijah to walk among them. The reason for this was because of religious scholars, studying of the book of Daniel had come up with a timetable that predicted that the coming of the Messiah would occur sometime in the first century CE. Many of these texts were also used by other cults at the time. That Christianity survived to propagate is really only indicative of natural selection. That it pushed all the right buttons and mixed all the right elements as well as dodging all the bullets is simply a matter of probabilities. It is not a question of uniqueness. By the same token the Arthur myth also widely shaped British culture, but nobody seriously asserts that he was a real historical figure. Make no mistake, 1 CE Palestine was simply awash with these kinds of cults, and and some of the surviving sources that attest to them are Josephus and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The answer to your initial question of was a possible Jesus unique in either the content or context of his life. Absolutely not. The surviving sources (Josephus and the Dead Sea Scrolls) strong imply that this kind of cult was in fact, very commonplace and very popular within the historical context. Most of this is documented in Richard Carriers "On the Historicity of Jesus Or Why We Might Have Reason To Doubt", which collates many sources and examines the historicity and mythicism arguments in detail. $URL$
