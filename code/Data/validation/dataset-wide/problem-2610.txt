I found "The Blessed One" in English translation of Suttas. Because in Buddhism blessing is not legit/proper word to use to anyone, especially Buddha need not to be blessed, is it loosely translated or in purpose? I didn't see any part of Sutta that one can be blessed or a meaning that blessing can be done so far. What should be proper translation of "The Blessed One" in Sutta if it is bad translation? 

Do not do any bad deed. Do all good deed in complete way (make them complete). Cleanse the mind from impurities. 

I do not know exactly to what extent he lived/survived only for other's welfare (at least he needed to consume to be alive in particular past life but probably, I guess). I like to request reference/citation if anyone knows about Buddha past lives regarding to this statement. 

The Sal Tree has Religious significance in Buddhism. It was believed that the prince Siddhārtha was born under Sal Tree and Gautama Buddha did Parinibbana (DN 16) under the pair of Sal Trees. The sal tree in Sri Lanka might be different from India and Burma but if people do respect to sal trees, it must be the two reasons above. 

For the people with difficult to focus, it is good to start watching breathing-in and breathing-out. Most important fact is you need to breath normally and naturally. If you try to breath faster, you will get tired very soon. If you try to breath slower, you will get distracted. The very first beginner can start counting breath, breath in and breath out count as one, another pair two and so on. Counting should not less than 5 and not more than 10 so that any mathematical distraction is not involved during meditation. The next stage is just watching on breathing in and breathing out without counting. There might be some distractions happen in your mind and lose attention on breath-in and out. Then you need to know there is distraction. As soon as you know there is distraction the train of thoughts(or some other form of distraction) will cease. Then you need to put your attention back to breath-in and out again. You need to do this till you are master to putting your attention back as fast as you start distracted. Soon you can get full attention on Anapanasati. Mind is very fast to tend to distraction even if you can do full attention to your breath-in and out. Then you need to do next level of Anapana. Get your attention to beginning of breath-in, middle (the air passing in your nose) of breath-in, end of breath-in; the beginning of breath-out, middle (the air passing out your nose) of breath-out, end of breath-out. If you can master this level of attention on Anapana, you can probably be free from focus problem in meditation. For the next levels of meditation, you need to approach a good teacher who can closely guide you. People with different hobbies, perspectives, intentions and goals needs to be taken care of by individually. You definitely need to go meditation centers and need to do proper retreat. There you can nurture/practice your mindfulness, concentration, and whatever you are looking for. 

Yes, in this information age, computer is like essential part in normal people life. But for monks, does it apply same way like that? Or computer can make harm than good to a monk? Does a book is better than electronic book on computer (in term of donation and uses by monk)? Typewriter (or more basic pen and book) is more distract-free than a computer? In this cruel world of advertisement, it is almost impossible a monk can avoid some explicit content while browsing internet. And internet and computer can be a great deal of wasting precious time of a monk if improperly used. Monks are not allowed to use/manipulate money but money is required to use a computer (buying softwares/applications/electronic books etc). Piracy is another serious potential issue for a monk who uses computer (it could lead to end of monk's life if stealing is involved). So is it better not to offer a computer to a monk or is there any chance that computer cannot make any harm to donor and monk both? If there are more harm than good, why do we need to care to offer a computer to a monk? If you are a monk and using computer but you are almost free from the harms that I described above, please let me know how this can be achieved? Please include do and don't if possible. It is expected that practices are Vinaya-complied uses of computer. 

In Buddha's teachings and Tipitaka, I do not see a slight extent of existence of Atta or some ambiguities about Atta by Buddha or monks at the Buddha's ages. All Buddha teachings are ubiquitously about Anatta. And Gautama Buddha repealed the very concept ’Atta’ in many Suttas. Since his second discourse “Anatta Latkhana Sutta", Buddha’s teachings are all about Anatta. Anatta is key concept in Buddha's teachings and Gautama Buddha was first and very first person opposite and challenged to popular Atta idealists at the age of his time. My question here is why some scholars and some publications from Pali text society are trying to coerce Atta concept in Buddhism or society of Buddhists? What are the supporting facts that Gautama Buddha and his teachings are self denial to its own Anatta concept? What are the proofs that Buddhism accept/adopt Brahmanism's Atta idea since both are clearly opposed to each other? Please keep in mind that the words self and not-self are loosely translated, have ambiguous meanings about referring internal and external based on perspective of particular individual being and not applicable/intended words here. Atta and Anatta is what I am referring here. The definition of Atta Atta is the word from Brahmanism, it is essence, from Brahma (or whatever creator make it exists), eternal or indefinite period of existence, it has capability of suffering pleasure and pain. It is in each and everyone bodies and pass from life to life. Some outside Buddha’s teachings define Atta as ’soul’ and/or self but precise definition of Atta is highly controversial. 

Instead sotapanna person has Samma Ditthi which is deeply discoursed by Sariputta in MN 9: Sammaditthi Sutta. In this sutta, 

The first part of the question is about desire. Desire is relative and not universal. It is not based on truth. It can even worse, it can lead anyone to magical illusion. In this world of materialism, material is power but not everywhere. You will definitely see the very sophisticated material or the very expensive material is practically useless in some corner of world. This fact indicate the desire of owning this material is very relative meaning. One you admired is vain for other or other place. This the very beginning fact is about futility of desire. Secondly, materials are always improving. If you earn one today, tomorrow better one come out and you will be jealous about other people who own it if you cannot make up your mind properly. And materialism world is endless abyss, bottomless abyss. There is no such case you will get extinguished your desire, the is no such thing/material with ultimate/optimal stage to be possessed. So cultivating, letting grow and hardworking to fulfill your desire is endless cycle of dog chasing it own tail; it will never stop. It is part of the life? It definitely not part of the life. It is what you want to believe. You want to own a material that is so sophisticated and it will going to change your life (like you are being deceived by advertisement). You made it yours by bloody and hardworking ways. After some time later it turn out not making pleasure/happiness you expected. This is the most case currently we are having, only the different of time taken to realize the truth, some people never realize, but the vain is obvious to them even if they do not want to believe. So this the third state of illusional about desire. If the desire is not about material, but for mental state/condition, it is more illusional. We all do judge wrong about material, desire, happiness, pleasure. But Buddha did indicate that we are mislead by desire. Desire does not send us a better place, peace; instead it makes suffering, endless struggle, illusional happiness (in this case, you are traveling in desert and you see illusion of water, you may be happy to see illusional water but you will never get a drop to drink). Buddha guided us to live a better life; to have goal/achievement oriented life. So in Buddha's teachings, you can find the way/path to ultimate/final goal free from continuous struggles and sufferings. Many Suttas are guidance to you, path to you. You are the one to walk along the path to ultimate extinguishing of desire, no one can send you. So there is a way/path, it is up to you to follow it. The second part of question is caring, nurturing child. Because you have to raise the child, for the people who stay in the house it is their duties/responsibilities to make your child well grown up, healthy and morally disciplined. There are many ethical guides both in Buddha's teachings and outside of Buddha's teachings. And also regional ethical aspect should be respected as well. There is no conflict between self liberation free from desire and nurturing your child. You should know the time when one is needed to practice and one is needed to complete. It is something like you make your own good and you make other people good. A good balancing is required. 

It is highly recommended that even though you are not doing any Akusala (keeping five precepts above), at least you should review yourself on daily/weekly basic that you should cherish your Sila is clean, not broken. It will make you have peace in mind and acquire concentration. Mindfulness/awareness is plus to your Kusala and it is not automatic. 

Did you take (at least) eight(8) precepts before meditation? You have to please yourself that your day is good and you didn't break any of eight precepts so that any immediate judging yourself will not occur. Are you doing meditation in quiet place where no sound distraction, no view distraction (the best practice is closing your eyes during meditation but any movement of people passing by, etc)? Dedication to meditation (you have strong determination to commit meditation no matter what dangers and hinderances you need to overcome). 

Inbuilt is also a quality/quantity someone had being practicing all over the past lives of oneself. Due to practicing the recurring actions, learnt and acquired knowledge and attitudes during past lives, you are who you are now and you have chemistry now that makes you and your own nature. Behavior is present actions. Current knowledge and attitudes have major influence upon it but it is also based on personal nature (the collected effects of past actions). That is why you can use the word fate because nature and behavior can make your life predictable unless you make turning point and changing direction. Buddhist teachings can help you to learn more about you and determine yourself whether you are going more sufferings direction or going to Nirvana. There are information and instructions in Dhamma for you getting the right direction to live with less sufferings and finally end of all sufferings. So in terms of personal practice, personal nature (past experiences collected) is not anymore major factor of your future if you can adapt/adopt Buddhism behavioral practices. You can maneuver yourself on right path and get the goal.
