If a non-physical answer is acceptable, then I think you could use religion and ideology as a way of keeping the populace on the ground. From your description this isn't what you're looking for, mostly because the civilisation you have seems very advanced (they're investigating space flight). However, if this religion was fairly new, say it arose with the advent of modern technology, then it could provide a reason for not ever building spaceships in the first place. That said, I think the best bet for a physical limitation is one that's already been proposed: a very stormy planet. 

Fire is incredibly useful. As humans we've invented too many uses to count. However a few of the highlights include: climate control, cooking, sanitization, metalworking, protection, warfare, transportation and combustion engines. There are workarounds for some of these such as using electricity to cook, fuse metals together, or using radiation to sanitize. Not having fire means that if you want an advanced society you need to have a different path through history. The main reason is that early advancements like firing clay, basic copper and bronze tools, and the invention of better ceramics for transporting and preserving goods require heat. Without the ability to use fire, your society must use some other heat source. Cooking, metalworking, firing clay, and things of that nature don't require fire specifically, they require heat. It just happens to be that fire was the most readily available form of heat to humans. Another barrier to advanced civilizations is that to get the ability to automate things using computers, wiring, and even basic electricity you need a source of heat. Without it there's no way to reach advanced technology. However, all is not lost. Fire might be the simplest, cheapest, most readily available source of heat here on earth, but on a world of gas that would probably be chemical reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions release heat and there are lots of sources for them. Throwing combustion aside for now, neutralization is probably the easiest. This is the reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. Using strong acids and bases you can achieve a portable heat source all you have to do is mix them together and poof heat. Another workaround for creating a lot of heat (enough for metalworking and everything else) is a thermite reaction using iron oxide and aluminum you can get temperatures of up to 2500 °C (iron's melting point is 1538 °C). Thermite does require some heat to get it up to its reaction temperature but using other chemical reactions you could achieve this. 

Fish have your answer: the lateral line. Its a sensory organ that runs the length of the fish's body. The lateral line allows fish to sense movement and vibration in water. If you adapt this a small amount you could easily allow for it to work in very thick gasses. The cells on the lateral line have sometimes mutated to allow for electroreception, which is something you should really look into. Electroreception allows for electrocommunication and electrolocation. Which seem to be what you're looking for. 

What you're describing seems closest to what D&D (and many other created worlds) refer to as sorcery which is a force that comes from within and is created by willpower (or in this case emotion). I would recommend looking at something like that. Sorcery might not be the correct name for your emotional magic however, as it sounds more like bewitchment or enchanting (the spells on people kind) because it feeds off emotions. You could even call it something as cliche as wizardry because that wouldn't necessarily box you into a corner and as you've already decided to create your own magic system wizardry (or similar) could be defined to mean anything you want. One final alternative would be to make up a word or series of words to represent this form of magic. Best of luck 

In my question, a space fabric "plane" consists of many "islands" strewn about, and any point of the plane which isn't part of an island is "bottomless". The "gravity" at a point is affected by the curvature of the fabric at the point, in addition to mass. Each island is "circular" or, to those inside, spherical with interior diameter 50 ly. The islands end asymptotically (the closer to the edge, the stronger the pull towards the edge and the faster the pull increases). Before the edge (i.e. slightly more inside) of the island, there is a border of "heightened" fabric (approaching the border, a ship would need to counter gravity). An island's interior is relatively flat (although there are some areas of slightly heightened or lowered fabric. Travel inside an island is with FTL; it takes about 3 days to traverse an island (i.e. go from an edge border point to the opposite). To travel between islands, the inhabitants of Islandia use fabric-casting devices mounted on large ships (abount 1.5 km long at minimum), called fabric-caster ships (FC ships). When "on" an island, it lies on the island, but if it goes over the edge border of an island, it "takes off" with cast fabric (the cast fabric functions like a platform over the bottomless pit). After that, they can't see outside their fabric "normally", but a FC ship is typically equipped with a navigation device to "see" islands (but not other FC ships; their fabric is too small to detect). They also can't communicate with an island until they "land" on it. If an FC ship's fabric-casting device fails while the ship is not on an island, the fabric is destroyed. The islands are about 3 to 4 months apart. A FC ship casts a fabric, spherical to those inside, about 50 km in diameter. Unlike island fabric, however, those fabrics end abruptly. Ships which travel with an FC ship travel close to it, to avoid falling off. Ship-cast fabrics rarely collide, because their heights usually differ. When they do collide, they destroy each other along with the ships on them. For this reason, FC ships adjust their heights so they're not the same as each other. 

I picture only few (one?) connection between adjacent countries, because then only one system has to be defended in case of an invasion. 

In the plane, there are two warring states (political entities). The territory of each is constituted of many islands, about 100 in number. There are 15 front islands on each side. Each side has about 1,000,000 military crafts (including support crafts, but not including fighters). The ships fight slower than light but can jump into FTL with recharge time 60 minutes. The weapons are mostly projectile weapons. Projectiles travel far below lightspeed (about 150 km/s on average). I think the major problem which puts an attacking fleet at a disadvantage is that attacks are far-flung expeditions; maintaining a supply line that long is very expensive. The defenders have clear advantage. Another thing I thought about is if a side would attack the capital right away (fleets are hard to stop when travelling on cast fabric) or island-hop little by little starting with front islands. In short, my question is 

Here, star systems are connected with "wormholes". The wormholes facilitate travel at $250\ c$, regardless of mass. They are made using special ships. Any travel (including military vessels) not through the wormholes is well below light-speed (not more than $0.05\ c$, ). It takes a road builder ship $50$ years to make each endpoint and $30$ years to make a light-year of "road". So, for example, to connect two systems $10$ light-years apart, a road builder ship takes $400$ years. A road cannot be constructed by more than 1 ship, not even by building from opposite ends. All of a road has to be built by one ship. Additionally, roads cannot intersect in the middle. Here are some more information on the setting: 

I am currently reading an eternal golden braid, i've gotten as far as several lengthy chapters about the brain. He talks about neurons and symbols, what 'meaning' is and there is a lot of hypotizing going on. To me much seem like assumptions about our mind from a mind strongly affected by its knowledge about computers. Anyway it intrigues me! I got the impression that the brain is somewhat well understood on the micro level (neuron-level, not neutron level) but that it all falls apart when trying to understand it on higher levels. (this book was ofcourse written decades ago) Given current electroengineering technology and sub-infinite resources how slow/big would our model of the neural net of the brain become? The neurons in the model should reflect our current biological understanding of them. size/speed is all free variables in this question. I reckon doing anything close to 86billion braincells got to be too slow/memory intensive for doing in software in general unspecialized supercomputers. By speed i mean how long a 'thought' would take compared to a human if somehow the net was constructed and jumpstarted and it actually became an 'I'. How feasible would it be for a near future megacorp to afford to try making one? 

Who are the Qu? When a person dies unobserved they give rise to a being called a Qu. This has happened since the beginning of time. They have caused many of the myths of ghosts and gods throughout the ages. A Qu is just like a regular person except that they cannot occupy the same physical space that is 'seen' by a human(or any creature with a human soul). A Qu obeys all normal physical rules and has all the needs of a normal human, they need to eat, sleep, prefer to socialize and procreate. The Qu shares all the memories of the human it spawned from, similarities in personality may or may not be coincidental. If a body/hand/atom of a Qu is caught in a direct sightline of a human it is repulsed by the speed of light until distance/lightdispersion renders it utterly invisible to the viewer. Example: If a Qu is standing in a room and a human walks in and looks around, the human sees nothing unusual and the Qu is crushed into the wall instantly. The energy from the impact obliterates the very atoms of the Qu in an instant and the energy from the impact is dispersed evenly throughout the entire multiverse. The 'vision' of the human is a very physical object in the Qu plane of existence. If a human stood still and watched continuously a Qu would see the human's vision field as a blur and could approach, touch it and climb it. The Qu population on earth is unknown, but presumed 'small'. In human cities Qus are almost non-existent and their lives tends to come to abrupt tragic ends. Due to their nature Qu's are drawn to the wilderness where there are few humans around. Entire villages of Qus can be wiped out by a single hiker if they are not careful, so they are, very careful that is. Only direct observation causes a Qu to be repulsed. A human looking at a digital camera feed does not affect a Qu, the Qu can be perfectly observed. Lenses, glass or reflection does not offer a Qu any protection. The technology in modern times have had both positive and negative impacts on the Qu communities. It is matter of time before concrete evidence rallies the humans to serious investigation, this far they are undetected by the scientific community. Questions: How would the organized Qu communities handle the emerging situation? And how would they go about achieving their goals? [Variables such as 'how clothing works' can be defined if need be]
