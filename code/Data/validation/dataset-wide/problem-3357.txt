Did the advocates subscribe to the Sapir-Whorf view of linguistic determinism? I don't believe it had to do with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis whereby a new language might be created which by being able to express only certain things would make it possible to only think those given things. Rather I believe the creators of Esperanto feel that different groups speaking different languages are a barrier to communication between groups which leads to misunderstandings between them. The idea was when all people can communicate with each other without the use of translators and interpreters who cannot always be trusted that it will be easier to identify with one another and thus reduce the risk of misunderstanding, conflict, and war. Since that hypothesis has now been widely rejected, what are the motivations of the Esperanto people today? No doubt some still believe an international language if widely adopted will lead us to understand each other and stop warring with each other. Others want to learn a language and it's supposedly easy. Others think it's cool to learn a constructed language and this is the most widely used. But I'm sure there are almost as many reasons people speak Esperanto as there are people who speak Esperanto. 

Perhaps no for the "normal" sense, but in some other important senses there is a kind of yes answer: There are languages which use Latin script with some extra digraphs or ligatures not present in English. Of these there are a couple in which some of those digraph or ligatures have three case variants, but only by one way of looking at case: 

In the languages I know more about I can't think of any cases of consonant phoneme clusters that are not made up entirely of consonant phonemes which also occur on their own in the language. But I'm wondering if this is not a universal phonology rule at all and if that's the case, what are some languages and consonant clusters that don't fit this pattern? 

As you know, English does not have grammatical gender, but only natural gender. Natural gender may apply in different languages to humans only, humans and "higher" animals etc, it may or may not include pronouns. English has all those kinds of natural gender. (English also has a quirk where some things such as ships may be referred to with female pronouns but this is not grammatical gender). The concept of neuter doesn't have much meaning in English other than contrasting the pronoun it with he, she, him, and her. What you will find when implementing a human language on a computer is that you will have to deal with semantics and context as well as just syntax. Treating gender as part of syntax will lead you to problems but if you want to match pronouns in English then you will need to have some kind of semantic or contextual awareness too. What I find is that when adding such semantics is that other factors then spring up, some of which are more important than gender, and usually they have semantic counterparts in some languages. Chief amongst these is animacy. Some verbs have different meanings if the subject is animate. Sometimes just figuring which noun phrases are subject, direct object, and indirect object requires you to know which are animate. Sometimes you may even want to distinguish between human and animal. So my answer is, for English, either leave out gender if you want something simple, or if you want something complex, then don't just implement gender but also either animacy or some kind of semantics, ontology, "real-world" knowledge, etc. 

Lately I've been wondering a lot whether or not there's an upper limit on how many contrasting tones a language can have that differ primarily by pitch difference and not so much by the shape or contour of the tones. People unfamiliar with tonal languages usually assume the tones are like different musical notes. But usually there are more tones with "shapes" than just pitch differences. Taking Standard Mandarin Chinese as an example: 

Wiktionary says this comes from Greek via Russian. The thing is Georgia is on the Black Sea which has plenty of dolphins so why wouldn't they have their own word since the times before contact with Greek civilization? Georgian is pretty resistant to borrowing basic vocabulary. There's a native word for "whale" for instance. Now loanwords are not as common in Georgian as in English, but they're not really rare. They are however mostly for modern/introduced concepts but Georgian is a pretty ancient language, it hasn't really moved, and dolphins have always existed in the world the Georgians inhabit. I have a couple of theories but they're unconvincing and I haven't been able to find any information: 

I seem to recall hearing and reading that certain Slavic languages including Czech treat animate nouns as something like an extra gender. Even Wikipedia in some places counts more than three genders for some Slavic languages (or used to, I will have to check for the current state of play). For instance here is one such quote from Wikipedia: 

I was browsing a language-learning book in the local public library today and came across this note on page ten of Get Started in Cantonese published by Teach Yourself: 

The sister languages of Georgian (Laz, Mingrelian, and Svan) also use the version concept. But what I'm wondering with this question is whether the concept of version is also used in any other languages. Kartvelian isn't known to be related to any other language families, but it is in a Sprachbund with other Caucasian languages and often terms in linguistics and grammar are borrowed by people describing other languages, especially ones in a neighbouring area or studied by the same people. 

I am pretty sure that some of the spoken varieties of modern Sinitic languages include words, morphemes, and/or particles which don't have a set written form. Now I'm aware that some words or morphemes can be written with more than one character and that arbitrary words, including borrowings from other languages can be written with characters by way of a kind of transliteration. What I'm asking about is either morphemes that exist only in spoken varieties of any language or dialect of Chinese and either have no written form, or can only be written in ad-hoc ways using transliterations or other kinds of character substitution. I'm mostly interested in words/morphemes native to the variety in which they're used but borrowings may also be of some interest. 

By pure coincidence I happened to try this out before I saw your question a few hours ago here in Georgia. In Georgian nouns are not marked for animacy, but some verbs are. "To have" is აქვს akvs for inanimate nouns but ყავს qavs for animate nouns. I was joking around with my Georgian friends and tried to say "I have one head", just to test this out in fact. I said: მე მყავს ერთი თავი. animate But my friends corrected and taught me that I should say instead: მე მაქვს ერთი თავი. inanimate So people are animate in Georgian, but body parts are not. (Side note: Cars are the only nonliving things in Georgian which take the animate word for to have.) 

I've just noticed that if you look in several English and Mongolian dictionaries that the Cyrillic Mongolian word "khan" is given as either "хан" with a short vowel, or "хаан" with a long vowel. (So far the only traditional Mongolian script I can find is "ᠬᠠᠭᠠᠨ", but I'm not sure which OSes / web browsers will render that correctly on Stack Exchange.) Vowel length is usually significant in Mongolian as in other "Altaic" languages. Is this an exception? Or was there some spelling reform in Mongolian that changed it over the years? Or are some sources simply wrong? Maybe they are both Mongolian words with slightly different senses? 

In my continuing interest in this pair of closely related languages I have noticed each uses an unrleated word for the negative particle meaning "no", "not", etc. 

Unlike Chinese and Japanese, Korean does employ spaces between words. What constitutes a lexical word differs from what constitutes an orthographic word. For instance, particles which can is some ways be compared to English prepositions, are written suffixed or cliticized to the end of a word. My Korean is very rudimentary to say the least but I believe I have seen in printed Korean the particle ("of" or "'s") at the beginning of the next line when the noun it would normally be attached to came at the end of the previous line. I would like to know is this the only place that Korean orthographic words can be separated? Or can line breaks occur at any position in the middle of a word? (There is a relevant article on Wikipedia, but it lumps Chinese, Japanese, and Korean together, with Korean receiving the least specific attention.) 

Yes they are antonyms. That doesn't affect whether they may have other, possibly even overlapping or seemingly contradictory relationships, such as being co-hyponyms. Antonyms are two words which are opposites. That seems pretty simple. But in fact you have to think about what "opposite" means, and what it means for words in particular. In the end it comes down to semantics like so many other things, and people will surely come up with multiple analyses. 

I've noticed that the Mongolian word for "new" is "шинэ" (or in traditional script, "ᠰᠢᠨ᠎ᠠ"). Since final vowels are not pronouned it's spoken as "shin". The Han character for "new", "新" is also pronounced pretty much as "shin" in Mandarin, Korean, and Japanese. Is the Mongolian word also derived from Chinese? It seems like it ought to be core vocabulary but as its been borrowed into Korean and Japanese it seems quite possible though those other languages facilitated a greater degree of borrowing due to using the Chinese writing system. 

There are many named concepts which relate to verbs across many languages. The three most well known would be tense, aspect, and mood. But person, number, and voice are others, and there must be many more. But should I call these "properties" of a verb, "charecteristics", "features", "categories"? Is there one term which is mostly used as a cover term for these and other verbal concepts when considered as a whole? Just to be clear, I'm not talking about the terms "TAM" or "screeve" which are used to describe verb inflections that result from the interaction of say tense and mood. I'm talking about what word to use in the sentence "Aspect and mood are two XXX's of verbs". What term belongs in the place of XXX? It's also possible that the same term might apply to concepts encoded in other parts of speech. For instance "Number and case are two YYY's of nouns"... 

Language can "improve" over time as well as "just changing". This is not to say that each change is an improvement or that improvements never come with negative side effects or that improvements must necessarily grow to outnumber negative properties. This also does not negate the fact than any concept can be expressed in any language. Languages actually can adapt innovations either invented by a speaker or observed in use in another language. The obvious is example is the acquisition of a writing system and literacy. Once a language can be written it is possible to communicate over greater distances are timespans. Few people would argue that any language was not improved when it gained a way to be written. Most of the world's languages either have no writing system, only gained a writing system in the 20th century, or have small literate populations despite governments or missionaries devising an orthography. Yet which seldom-written languages are prominent world or national languages? Another example would be borrowing, calquing, or devising words for new concepts. Whether a language has an academy or not, speaker populations will begin referring to new concepts such as horses, guns, cars, satellites, sushi, computers, e-mail, etc. Now could it possible for languages to acquire other improvements such as grammar and syntax? I seem to recall reading somewhere once that features such as relative clauses or some forms of recursion were not always universal but were passed from language to language much like other good ideas. I find this possibility very tantalizing and would like to read any references about it. Please add a comment (-: 

In Japanese and Korean (and I have to assume the Okinawan / Ryukyuan languages also), pronouns are quite different from most other languages from most families in at least two ways I can think of: 

How do linguists decide whether a language under investigation has an indefinite article as opposed to just having a word for "one"?
