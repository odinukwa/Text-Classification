This depends how much it was assembled before going into the box. I've had one bike that just needed the stem bolts to be loosened and the stem rotated, plus the pedals fitted (using tools provided). The one I bought recently needed a little more work but still only using tools you'd carry on the road plus a pedal spanner. That was a used bike, and had been dismantled just enough to go back in the box. The seller should be able to tell you exactly what is required. It's well worth asking them. Important things to be aware of: 

Some apps will use the GPS altitude information - and the errors on that can be quite large at ground level with clutter (basically all the satellites you can see are above you which doesn't help). Here's an example: Until a few days ago I was using cardiotrainer and the last 3 times I ran the same 10km loop I got 59m, 22m and 0m total climb. I'm confident this just gets altitude from the GPS. Other apps/services will have access to terrain mapping which will pick up a different set of altitude changes (maybe more, maybe less depending on the dataset). Some won't use any altitude data at all but I would assume that Strava does and that's your lower figure so unless you're riding downhill all the way we can assume that cyclemeter does too. Then you get in to how they smooth the track data in the horizontal (more noticeable running, but you get cheated on tight turns). A big difference will come from what it assumes about drag (and your own efficiency but lets stick to the mechanical stuff for now). If 1 app is calibrated for a road racer, tucked right down, lycra, 23mm rock-hard tyres and smooth tarmac it will assume vastly less power than an app assuming a city bike with wide tyres, some tread,an upright posture and a scarf trailing behind. Let's take a guess and assume that Strava likes road bikes. What assumptions do they make on the downhills? We don't know, but you might or might be pedalling hard or resting, and the speed alone is insufficient to know which given the other variables. If we assume (erroneously) that the apps I've used in the past are spot on, then with me being a little lighter than you the truth lies somewhere in between, probably closer to the higher figure (I was getting just under 500cals for 10 miles with some hills in 40-45 minutes, across a few apps). So what use is it? Well, it lets you compare routes (do you want a workout or an efficient commute, are you trying to train and explore the area at the same time). If you're training seriously your efficiency and your basal metabolic rate will be affected, and both need a lab to measure them (therefore values are assumed in the apps, another source of difference). You could if you wanted (and I've done this so I know the data is out there) take your speed profile and plug it into an equation for the required power (most sources are for road racers but there are different drag coefficients out there). Then you'd need to use simple physics on your total climb to work out how much work you did, convert this to calories and take into account human efficiency, values for which vary hugely. This would be a laborious way to pick which app you're going to trust. 

Helmets are intended to be worn while cycling in the sun, so they have to be ok. Now that in many places it's normal to leave helmets on bikes stored outside all day. Plausible damage mechanisms are UV and heat. Through glass there will be less UV than outside, so we can dismiss that indoors. Heat is harder to dismiss but if you're in a temperate place it's not likely to get as hot as outside in full sun. Anyway your helmet is white so won't absorb much heat from the sun. The lack of airflow isn't a big deal. There's not much airflow riding slowly especially as your head blocks it. 

Despite editing this down I could make it into a comment (plus:pictures), so here are some ideas: At the very least 1 or more streamer (like wide ribbons) would be less likely to snag than a large flag, as well as being less of a shock if it gets someone in the face. 

Marathon plus are great - though I have had 1 puncture - a drill-tipped roofing screw, about 13mm long. If she doesn't want to fix punctures at the roadside (and taking the wheel off on a folder with hub gears may be a hassle), then in addition to the best tyres you can get consensus on, you should probably run with some leave-in sealant - I've heard good things about slime, though I personally carry a spare tube. 

That's rough. Rotten luck and you have my sympathy. When you say "as a kid" am I right to think not fully grown? Because little kids start closer to the ground, don't weigh as much, and don't tend to be going as fast, but crash a lot. Teenagers are a different matter: good reactions but poor judgement and the size and speed of adults, but they're quick to heal and fractures tend to be less severe as their bones are more flexible. Did you by any chance suffer any kind of hand injury? Apparently breaking the clavicle is common coming off a bike if you put your hand down, but that's instinctive (I was lucky recently that I was still holding the flat bars when I hit the ground, and was a lot slower). You may never know exactly why you came off this time (why you got to the grass in the first place). Maybe you were pushing your speed right to the limit of the grip on a bend and hit a bad bit of road, or instinctively dodged something. Maybe you were very close and the wind shifted. Maybe tiredness contributed. Trying to hop back onto the road was a bold move that I couldn't carry off, but many people could and you know your own skills. Maybe it would have worked but for continuing bad luck. When you get back on the bike, you'll have to build up gradually. You won't be as fast, as flexible, or as fit (even if the medics allow you to do some trainer work as part of your recovery - you may even be encouraged to at the later stages but). Go out with a group, but a slower one, and people you trust not to push you too hard until you're ready - buddies are great for confidence. Start with decent riding conditions - if you're in the Northern hemisphere that's easy as you'll be out in the summer. Know that you've got to look after yourself. And see a good physio, preferably one who specialises in injured athletes. Right now you're not in a good place, but as you get back out and ride you'll be able to make a full recovery from the mental as well as the physical trauma. 

There are times you can and times you can't. I've got a regular descent at around 50km/h, which seems to be a bit of a transition. The typical car speed there is 60-70km/h. Cars coming downhill don't make as much engine noise as on the flat, and small new vehicles are inaudible there. It's not all engine noise of course. I've heard a tesla coming up behind from the wheel noise alone. When you're behind a very noisy vehicle it drowns or other vehicle noises. In fact the last time a car hit me I would have heard it coming had it not been for a very loud train nearby (wing mirror hit my arm as I lifted my hand off the bars to signal. The mirror broke; I didn't). So you can't rely completely on your ears. But they're still very useful (I say this as someone who has and uses a mirror on my main bike). Generally speaking you can hear when the closing speed is significant. When you're going slowly you can hear cards at any speed. When you're going reasonably fast you can hear fast cars, but of course you don't get much warning before they catch you up. What's really useful is that you can hear the change of gear and revs before someone pulls out to overtake. At typical urban speeds you can also get quite a lot of information about speed and position of following vehicles. 

I'd be a little wary of that text in wikipedia. Here's the relevant diff from the edit history. The user in question didn't add any sources and is quite inexperienced. I suspect a bit of a wording issue: bushingless could mean having no bushings, or having no parts that act solely as bushings. The inner plates of a modern chain have protrusions that can be regarded as fulfilling the role of bushings in that they are intermediate between the pin (axle) and roller. They're quite clear in this Park Tools dismantled view. 

I built one out of timber, part of an old car bike rack (you could easily pick up a damaged one 2nd hand for this) and a few plumbing fittings. I usually use it for storage, but I built it as a work stand. The timber was left over from other jobs, all the other bits were parts I had anyway, so total cost was zero. Realistic cost in the region of £30/$50 if you don't have to buy a bike carrier (which was disassembled, not destroyed in the process). I also painted it with fence paint so I can leave it outside if it gets in the way, or use it for cleaning bikes if I want to get the gears to a nice working height. The upright is only 2x2" though, I'd recommend a fence post instead for stiffness. I'll try to get a picture at the weekend, when I can get to it in the light. 

I saw a bike for hire in France, and I'd like to track down more details on it or something similar. Unfortunately the hire logos covered the manufacturer logos and the bike was locked up to others (all with the same colour frames) meaning I couldn't get a picture to show anything clearly. And the shop was closed. It was a rear-steer tandem, with quite small wheels (maybe 24"). In front of the rear rider's saddle¹ was a low saddle with fixed handlebars and foot pegs. This was positioned rather like the top-tube child seats common in Europe, but from the design of the child's handlebars it was clearly integrated into the frame at manufacture. It looked suitable for a tall adult at the back and up to a short adult at the front. All three sets of handlebars where slightly swept-back flat bars. This seems more sociable than putting a rear toddler seat on a tandem (where they can't be heard). It would also have a higher weight limit and allowing panniers. The only current manufacturer of rear-steer tandems I can find is Nijland, and they are all step-through (so no top-tube to put the child seat on). ¹ I guess I should call it the captain's as this is where the steering handlebars are.
