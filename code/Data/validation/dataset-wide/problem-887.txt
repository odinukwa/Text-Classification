Seeing is typically measured as the FWHM of the seeing disk, but can also be expressed though the Fried parameter $r_0$, which measures the size, or strength, of the parcels of gas that cause the turbulence in the atmosphere. The relation between the two is (e.g. Vernin & Munoz-Tunon 1995) $$ \text{seeing} = 0.98\frac{\lambda}{r_0}, $$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. $r_0$ can by calculated by integrating the "turbulence strength" along the line of sight$^\dagger\!\!$, and scales as $\lambda^{6/5}\!$. Because of this dependence, the "usual" seeing has only a weak ($\lambda^{-1/5}$) dependence on wavelength. From the Wikipedia article on seeing: 

If there are only two bodies, then they will never enter a mutual orbit. For two objects initially gravitationally unbound, in order to become gravitationally bound you must remove energy from the system. With only two bodies (that don't collide), this does not happen. They will accelerate toward each other, change directions according to how close they get, and then leave each other again with exactly the same total energy and momentum as before, but in general shared in some other ratio (for instance, if a small body encounters a large body, the smaller will gain energy and leave with a larger velocity). On the other hand, if you have three (or more) bodies, one may get slung out with high velocity, thus extracting energy from the two others, which can then go in orbit. But alas, there's no equation for this; the so-called N-body problem has no analytic solution, and must in general be solved numerically. 

The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of the Milky Way (MW) — called Sgr A* [Sagittarius A-star] — has no direct impact on our galaxy. Its mass is only a few million Solar masses, and if you remove it$^\dagger$, it will only affect the most central stars, which would suddenly continue in straight paths out through the MW. These stars would almost surely not hit any other stars or something like that (since stars are really, really far apart), but some of them have velocities high enough that they may escape the MW. If Sgr A* weren't there to begin with, things might look a little different. There seems to be a relation between the mass of a galaxy's SMBH and the velocity dispersion of the stars in its central bulge; the so-called M-sigma relation. so MW without Sgr A* would mean a more ordered center. Our Solar system is located in the disk, far from the center, and their is evidence that SMBHs have little impact on the disk (Gebhardt et al. 2001). However, in their early phase (as an active galactic nucleus), their extreme luminosities cause galactic superwinds which blow out gas and may quench star formation (Tombesi et al. 2015). $^{^\dagger}$Removing Milky Way's SMBH is left as an exercise for the reader. 

The term "nebula" has been used historically for virtually any astronomical object that was fuzzier than stars. Specifically, galaxies which to the naked eye and in small telescopes looked like elongated clouds were called nebulae (e.g. the Andromeda Nebula), even though they definitely aren't clouds. Nowadays, the term is mostly used in the context of planetary nebulae, which are the beautifully colored death breaths of low-mass stars, lighted up by a central white dwarf. These objects were originally thought to be planets, but has nothing to do with that. Other types of nebulae are usually called by their more descriptive names, e.g. molecular clouds, HII regions, and supernova remnants. The only objects I can think of that are often called nebulae, are reflection nebulae, which are the clouds of dust and gas surrounding a young star cluster. 

Small galaxies (say of masses $\sim10^7M_\odot$) can be torn apart by stellar feedback, i.e. the energy provided by exploding stars in a starburst. Whether you want to call the debris galaxies is a matter of opinion, I suppose, but since these guys typically are satellites of larger galaxies, it will probably be torn completely apart by tidal forces, eventually accreting onto the larger one. Large galaxies (say of masses $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) are too massive to be split by feedback, but may lose matter (mostly gas, rarely stars) through large-scale outflows created by stellar feedback (or a quasar jet). However, when two large galaxies collide and merge, sometimes large chunk of gas, stars, and dark matter are slung out, which arguably could be called individual galaxies. Most of the matter of the two original galaxies become one, though. 

$^\dagger$Solids are not entirely incompressible, since otherwise sounds wouldn't be able to propagate through them. 

Models are uncertain I'm guessing that you are referring to age estimates of very old stars. The age of a star can be determined from certain observables, among one is its absolute luminosity, which in turn requires a precise measurement of its distance. Even today, the uncertainties involved yield estimates with mean values longer than the age of the Universe, which of course is impossible. For instance, the age of the star HD 140283 was found as late as in 2013 to be $14.46\pm0.8$ billion years (Gyr). This is not really in conflict with the estimated age of the Universe, $13.798\pm0.037$ Gyr; all this tells us is that our methods are still not perfect, but that HD 140283 was formed shortly after the Big Bang. Time dilation is small General relativity predicts that time evolves more slowly in a graviational field. This is with respect to an observer outside the gravitational field, and since there is no external observer wrt. the Universe, the global time of the Universe can be said to be the "right" time. You're right that in principle the total mass of the Universe makes time run slower than in a hypothetical, empty universe, but almost anywhere in the Universe, the gravitational field is way too weak to cause any noticeable dilation. Close to massive objects, time does run slow. On the surface of a star, the time dilation factor is roughly $(1 - GM/rc^2)^{-1/2} = 1.000002$. Inside the star, the factor is even closer to unity, because only the mass between the center and you contributes, so the farther you dive into the star (kids, don't try this at home), the less the time dilation. Only if you compress the star, so as to squezze it into a neutron star of a black hole, will you get a larger time dilation. For instance, at the "surface" of a black hole, time stops (but again, only wrt. an external observer; for the person at the surface, time evolves as expected) 

You see that immediately blueward of Ly$\alpha$, everything is wiped. As you go along the spectrum toward the blue, that part corresponds to later and later epochs, because is takes longer time to redshift that part into Ly$\alpha$. Hence, eventually the Universe becomes less and less neutral, and the absorption is no longer complete. 

Millennia ago, when only a few thousand stars, a handful of planets and nebulae, and some transient objects like supernovae and comets, were known, people usually named these objects after gods and heros, but also after everyday objects. Stellar constellations that vaguely resembled something known, was named after this. Mars is red, so it was named after the god of war; Mercury, being the fastest to complete one cycle around the Sun, was named the god of messaging and traveling. With the advent of telescopes, so many objects are now known that we had to come up with a more pragmatic convention, so usually an object is named according to its place in some catalogue, its type, and/or it coordianates on the sky. For instance, a quasar detected at the "J2000" coordinates $\{\mathrm{dec.},\mathrm{RA}\} = \{22^\circ\, 22'\, 56'', -09^\mathrm{h}\, 46^\mathrm{m}\, 36^\mathrm{s}\}$ may be called J2222–0946. An x-ray source observed in the constellation Cygnus may be called Cyg X-1, while its binary counterpart is number 226,868 in the Henry Draper Extension Catalogue and is thus named "HDE 226868". Oftentimes, an object appears in multiple catalogues, and will thus have multiple names. For instance, a Lyman $\alpha$-emitting galaxy appears in a catalogue of Ly$\alpha$ emitters, but due to its infrared properties, it will also appear in some catalogue over dusty galaxies (though Ly$\alpha$ emitters tend to contain little dust). 

The amount of metals locked up in planets is completely negligible compared to that of the interstellar medium (ISM). First, in a typical stellar system, the mass fraction of planets is less than 1%, and of this by far the most mass will be in gaseous planets, rather than rocky planets. For instance, in the Solar System, the mass fraction of all planets is 0.1%, while rocky planets comprises only a fraction of $6\times10^{-6}$. Second, typically only a small fraction of the gas in a galaxy is locked up in stars. For small galaxies — which are the most abundant — as little as ~5% of the gas is in stars (e.g. Schombert et al. 2001), although for large galaxies like the Milky Way, which are more efficient at converting gas into stars, the ISM-to-stellar gas fraction can be of order unity (e.g. Morokuma-Matsui & Baba 2015). That is, the fraction of metals locked up in planets is of the order $10^{-5}\text{–}10^{-7}\!$, depending somewhat on the type of galaxy considered. On the other hand, the fraction of metals locked up in dust is considerable, with typical values of roughly 1/3 of the metals in dust. Thus, if you want to know the metallicity of a galaxy by looking at emission or absorption lines from metals, you must either account for this factor (hoping that it's a universal factor which it may or may not be, see e.g. Zafar & Watson 2013), or measure metals that tend not to deplete to dust grains, e.g. zinc or sulfur. 

$^1$I.e. the continuous and relatively featureless spectrum of many different atomic transitions and physical processes. $^2$I.e. features in the spectrum resulting from strong atomic transitions. For instance, an eletron falling from the second to the first excited states of a hydrogen atom emits a photon with the wavelength 6563 Å, called "H$\alpha$". $^3$The light isn't really "reflected". Instead, it is the high-energy photons (UV and X-rays) of the continuum that ionize the atoms in the clouds. When the ions recombine, they emit spectral lines. 

No, not really. As Stan Liou hints at in his comment, massive objects such as black holes (BHs) were previously a candidate to dark matter (DM). But it can be shown that in order to explain the various problems that the existence of DM needs to solve, there would have to be so many, that their gravitational effect ("microlensing") on background sources would be much larger than what is observed. Today, most people think that DM is simply a particles with an extremely small interaction cross section, such that it virtually doesn't interact with other particles, except through gravitational attraction. You also ask if there's any spatial relationship, and in a way you could say there is. Most, if not all, galaxies sport a supermassive BH, and these tend to lie in the center of the gravitational potential wells created by the galaxies' DM. "Normal" BHs, however, just float around like stars. BHs also tend to grow by accretion of matter onto them, and of course they can also eat DM, so to some extend BHs also consist of DM. But since the DM doesn't interact, a DM particle would need to fly directly toward the BH, lest it would simply be deflected and escape. Normal matter, on the other hand, is slowed down by friction and spirals toward the BH. Thus, BHs consist mostly of normal matter. It doesn't really matter, though, since after something has fallen into a BH, everything but its mass, charge, and angular momentum will be forgotten. Dark energy is something completely different, better described as a negative pressure which is a property of space itself. I think. Or we think. Nobody really knows. But it presence doesn't correlate with that of BHs or DM. Ten years ago, there was a hypothesis that a collapsing star should be converted into dark energy rather than a BH, causing a so-called dark-energy star, but I don't think anybody believes this anymore.
