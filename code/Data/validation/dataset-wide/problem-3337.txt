This answer does not address the source of the Vietnamese word, just the Vietnamese/Lao connection. The folk etymologies are interesting enough, why not just leave them be? The pronunciation of the Vietnamese and Lao words are very close if not identical - /fɤ:/. The Vietnamese tone is a ‘dipping’ tone that drops and then rises, at least in citation form (Thompson’s description). The Lao tone rises from a low beginning, so it seems to be quite similar to its Vietnamese counterpart. There is no equivalent word in Thai (although you might see some version of it on the menus of restaurants serving the Vietnamese dish.) This suggests that Lao has borrowed the Vietnamese word. I don’t see how 粉 would tie in here. It means flour or powder, and there is a final –n that doesn’t fit. There might conceivably be a connection with another word for Vietnamese rice noodles, bún (as in the dish bún cha). While we’re on the subject of Southeast Asian noodle dishes and etymology, Thai has a dish called ขนมจีน /kʰənom tɕi:n/ which consists of boiled rice noodles, fresh vegetables and herbs, all mixed together and topped with a curry sauce. The name appears to mean “Chinese dessert”, but it was actually borrowed from the Mon word for “to boil”. The proximate source would have been Mon refugees from Burmese wars who settled in Bangkok and central Thailand during the 18th century. 

I have two questions concerning words for colors, one specific and one general. First, Beekes in Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction (p. 181) reconstructs a PIE suffix –no- that forms adjectives. An example is * krs-nó- ‘black’: Skt. kṛṣṇá-, OCS črъnъ *(<čъrsn-) (so Russian черный). Several color terms in Latvian, such as sarkans ‘red’ and dzeltens ‘yellow’ look like they might also fall into this category. Can anyone confirm this? Now the more general question. How diachronically stable are color terms? On the one hand, there is an argument for stability. We can broadly distinguish core or basic vocabulary from cultural vocabulary. Introductory historical linguistics textbooks say that core vocabulary tends to be conserved because it is less susceptible to borrowing.* Most languages will include a certain number of color words in their core vocabulary. Simply because they are ‘basic’, we can assume that these color words are fairly conservative. The fact that children learn color words very early also suggests that transmission of these words across generations of speakers is likely to be relatively stable. On the other hand, I can think of several paths by which color words might be replaced over time. Colors may be associated with certain nouns (like blue with the sky), which might come to be used in place of the color (like ‘salmon’ as a color). Or some factor of material culture, e.g. how dyes are produced, might influence the color word used. Examples here might include Chinese characters for colors with the grass, bamboo or silk radicals (藍, 紅), which seem to reflect a physical source like the indigo plant.** I am aware of Berlin and Kay’s study of color systems, and that seems to be mainly synchronic. To what extent can we reconstruct color terms for PIE? 

Statements like N 很 Adj can be reformulated with a degree complement, so that 很 is not in copula position: 那個書好得很 ‘That book is very good.’ When negated with 不, 很 isn’t needed, i.e. 他不好 is well-formed, although 不太好 ‘not so good’, adding a different degree adjective, is common. Another predicate structure can also occur with some adjectives (generally ones that are non-gradable): ‘是…的’. A few adjectives can appear in predicates with either structure: 

Leaving the broader question about copulas to one side here. Po and Rimmington’s ‘Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar’ (Routledge) has a good explanation for why ‘我好’ is not a well-formed answer to ‘你好嗎?’ (which I’m guessing is the context.) Having the predicative adjective unmarked implies a contrast, ‘I’m good (but not him!)’. A degree adverb like 很 is needed to get a neutral reading. P and R further remark that ‘in fact the degree adverb很 hen3 ‘very’, unless it is emphasized, does not really mean ‘very’, and its integration into an adjectival predicative is more often than not to counteract an implication of contrast.’ (p.60) Still, many other adverbs would work in this slot, for example 非常 fei1chang2, an unambiguous ‘very’. Some additional points that could suggest that 很 is not a copula: 

Well, there are more homophones in Mandarin than in its ancestor Middle Chinese, but this is compensated for by increased use of compounding. Still, other Sinitic languages like Cantonese did not lose as many distinctions and (as far as I know) still have an increased frequency of compounds, so it’s debatable whether this is a case of compensation. In Haudricourt’s theory of tonogenesis, which applies to Chinese, Vietnamese and many other Southeast Asian languages, final consonant mergers led to contour tones, and voiced/unvoiced initial mergers led to low/high tones, generally. So new distinctions in the rhyme arose (or were already present but became phonetic) to replace the consonantal distinctions that were lost. 

Here are some examples from Thai. In the first two, the [w] letter is a glide, so the tone mark goes above or slightly after it. It is part of the onset consonant, not the rhyme. In the last two, the [w] letter is part of the rhyme, so the tone mark goes before it, over/after the consonant. If you look at rhyming words, you could confirm this. For instance, /kwaa/ can rhyme with /khaa/, but /duan/ would not rhyme with words ending in –an, like /kan/ ‘with’. That’s because the [w] is part of the onset in the first case, part of the rhyme/coda in the second. There are exact Lao equivalents for all the examples given, if you want to look them up. I recommend getting a good Lao dictionary if you want to learn about word shapes in the language. 

Khasi, an Austroasiatic language spoken in Northeast India, differs from practically all other members of that family (at least those outside the Munda branch, as @user6726 rightly points out) in having grammatical gender. There is a paper about this: Lili Rabel-Heymann, ‘Gender in Khasi Nouns’, Mon-Khmer Studies Journal IV: 247-72 (1977), available online here. 

We are gearing up for the new semester at the Thai university where I teach English. One course I’ll be helping out with is on English pronunciation. In the unit on sentence stress, the course textbook introduces the idea of stress-timed vs. syllable-timed languages: in the former type, sentence rhythm is determined by units each based around one stressed syllable, while in the latter, each syllable receives an equal beat in ‘machine-gun’ fashion. In stress-timed languages, vowels in unstressed syllables are often reduced (as with the schwa in ‘the’, English being stress-timed.) Presumably vowel reduction happens less if at all in syllable-timed languages. The contrast in sentence rhythm is illustrated by two pictures: a row of people of different heights walking in groups of two or three for stress-timed, and a row of soldiers of equal height marching in formation for syllable-timed. The book presents English as a stress-timed language, and students learn to differentiate content words (which receive stress) from function words (which are generally unstressed.) It mentions in passing that Thai, by contrast, has syllable-timed rhythm. Is this correct? The Wikipedia entry on ‘isochrony’ lists Thai with the stress-timed languages. It cites a study by Dauer (1983). However, the findings of this study (I don’t have access to the full text) seem to be that there is no empirical phonetic basis for grouping languages according to syllable/stress/mora-based rhythm in this way. Two 2008 entries on the blog ‘Language Log’ by Mark Liberman also question the reality of stress vs syllable rhythm. Liberman measures the speech rhythms of a Spanish/English bilingual and finds that while his Spanish speech is more rhythmically regular than his English speech, this is due mainly to Spanish having fewer consonant clusters and thus more uniformity in duration of articulating each syllable. In Liberman’s view there are other motivations for a more uniform rhythm, it’s not a general feature for any given language. Consulting the bibliography of Thai linguistics in the Routledge Tai-Kadai volume doesn’t turn up anything that directly addresses the question of whether Thai is stress- or syllable-timed. I’m an English native speaker who speaks both Thai and Mandarin pretty well. Mandarin is supposed syllable-timed. If we look at the rhythm at the level of individual sentences, it’s not hard to find an example that contradicts the general characterization. The sentence ‘His car broke down’ can translate as follows into each language: Mandarin: 他的車子壞了. Tāde chēzi huài le. The rhythm here seems to be trochaic (stressed-unstressed). Thai: รถยนต์ของเขาเสีย Rót yōn khŏng kháo sĭa. Each syllable receives more or less equal stress. (I’m using ĭ and ŏ to represent rising tones here.) So in this small example, Mandarin seems stress-timed, Thai syllable-timed, not the other way around. I have two questions here. 

Thai lacks grammatical gender, but men and women use different first person pronouns. Actually it’s more complicated than that, there are a number of ways to refer to oneself depending on context and the relative status of speaker and addressee. But the choices are different for men and women, generally. For example, women who want to sound polite may need to refer to themselves as ‘mouse’ when talking to higher status people. A linguistic study of this by Diller and Chirasombutti found that “Thai women are required by the prevailing linguistic system to ‘place themselves’ through self-reference selections in a more finely-determined social space than that required of male speakers.” This also correlates with sentence-final polite particles (men use khrap, women kha). It’s such a thorough-going system that it would be extremely difficult to change – getting rid of it would be a radical alteration in the ways politeness is communicated. On the other hand, you could say it’s PC even though not gender-neutral, because it can accommodate transgender people. E.g. a biological male who identifies as a woman can use feminine pronouns/particles to assert his/her gender identity. According to Dixon (Basic Linguistic Theory vol 2, p. 200), “very many languages” do distinguish gender in third person singular pronouns only, so you may be able to find some without grammatical gender that do so. But be aware that there are many other possibilities cross-linguistically, as with Thai. Reference: A. Diller and V. Chirasombutti, "Who am ‘I’ in Thai? – The Thai First Person: Self-reference or Gendered Self?" in P. Jackson and N. Cook eds, Genders and Sexualities in Modern Thailand, (Silkworm 2000), pp. 114-133. 

Here is some data on the question from Latvian, which as it so happens makes this distinction. In Latvian, the first person possessive adjective is ‘mans/mana’ (masc/fem). It declines with the noun it modifies. The genitive case form of the first person pronoun is ‘manis’. Uses of possessive adjective: In noun phrases: mans draugs ‘my friend’ In predicate position: Tas divritenis ir mans. ‘That bicycle is mine.’ Uses of genitive pronoun: In prepositional phrases: Pirms manis ir bijis tikai viens īpašnieks. Before me, there has been only one owner. In constructions requiring the genitive: Manis nav. I don’t exist./I am not there. (negative construction) Vai tev manis trūka? Did you miss me? (genitive complement of ‘trūkt’ to miss) So this is pretty much in line with TKR’s expectations in his comment. Note that there is no distinction made between ‘my’ and ‘mine’. There’s an additional complication though: possessive adjective forms exist only for the first and second person singular. For the plurals and for third person, the genitive pronoun is used across the board, like this: viņa drangs ‘his friend’ viņas draugs ‘her friend’ Viņa nav. ‘He’s not here.’ Viņas nav. ‘She’s not here.’ Tas divritenis ir jūsu. ‘That bicycle is yours (pl.).’ So as TKR pointed out, every language has its own idiosyncracies. This is certainly something to pay attention to when learning a language with a well-developed case system. Have fun with Icelandic!
