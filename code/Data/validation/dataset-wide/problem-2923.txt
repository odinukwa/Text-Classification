There is no necessary requirement that a successful political strategy in a democracy be fully rational or internally consistent if the voter's decisions are not rational and internally consistent. The only requirement for a political party is that it succeed, politically (i.e. win elections). Overall I see two facets that are required a party to succeed 

I believe that you are getting confused between applying the same word, e.g. gravity, to both our understand/description of what is going on and to the actual physical phenomenon. Sometimes explicit language is used to differentiate these cases. Sometimes you might hear "the law of gravitation" or "theory of gravity" or similar to refer to the scientific ideas and mathematical description of the phenomenon. Sometimes you might hear terms like "the phenomenon of gravity" or "the physical effects of gravity" or similar which call out that the speaker is referring the physical phenomenon. This is how we can refer to the natural phenomenon itself. I'm sure that there are instances where a bare term, i.e. just "gravity", is used to refer to the phenomenon itself, and there are other instances, involving a different context, where it is used to refer to the conceptual understanding. It is up the the audience to infer exactly what is meant. In mentally reviewing the use of the term "gravity" without qualifiers like "theory of" or "law of" or "equations for", I can't think of an instance where it means anything other than the physical phenomenon. I've always heard Newton's result referred to as "the universal law of gravitation", not just bare "gravity". I see the same pattern in "evolution" (refers to the physical phenomenon) and the "theory of evolution" (refers to the conceptual picture). So I suspect that the default, in the absence of any qualifiers, is that the bare terms tend to (but not necessarily always) refer to the physical phenomenon. 

If 5. is a premise then 3. and 4. are unecessary, at least according to any way that I'd formalize the problem. If 5 is meant to be an inference, then 5 does not follow from 3. and 4. without additional premises. In words, 3 rules out choice for "pure randomness" cases, and 4. rules out choice for "pure caused by effects" cases. Without some additional information on the structure of what constitutes a choice we cannot rule out that there are effects that are caused by a mix of randomness plus prior causal effects that lie within the set of things that comprise choices. More formally, Let R, E be the set of random causes and the set of effects respectively; together these constitute the domain of discourse. I'm going to formalize "choice" as a predicate on the subsets of the domain of discourse. Bullet 3. is "for any subset r of R, choice(r) is false". Bullet 4. is "for any subset e of E, choice(e) is false". This says nothing about choice(x) when the set x contains a combination of elements from both R and E. 

This language is undoubtedly influenced by the ideas of Galileo, what, in modern times, is called Galilean invariance. Using modern language: this is the global symmetry under which the laws of motion (i.e. Newton's laws) are invariant. This symmetry persisted as a foundation of mechanics up until the time of the discovery of Relativitity, when Lorentz invariance was recognized as the relevant symmetry property. Although General Relativity does cover the cases where there are locally defined reference systems, this is not (to my knowlege) referred to as a gauge symmetry -- that term is reserved for the complete invariance of the dynamics, in particular the invariance of the solution(s), to changes in some of the degrees of freedom in the system description. Section IV of the treatise further elaborates the idea of relative space. Its unclear to me, who is not a scientific historian, to what extent he is wedded to the idea of the idea of "fixed space", although he does not explicitly reject it. Newtons elaborations on the movement of the ship relative to the Earth, and things in the ship that move relative to it, is a clear reference to Galilean invariance. I find it interesting that he hedges on whether the Earth itself moves in an absolute sense -- either he believed that this was a possibility, or he recognized that, for the purposes of any one discussion, you can pick a particular reference frame, and measure all motions relative to it; making that selected frame the arbiter of what constitutes absolute motion. Note that all symmetries lead to a conservation law (Noether's theorem) it's just that in the case of local symmetries, that convservation law is a conserved current. In one sense your final question doesn't have an answer: there simply are not gauge degrees of freedom for spacetime itself in GR. The other way to look it is that GR provides the description for locally varying frames of reference already, but it is not a gauge theory. 

What kinds of moral theories, or even just considerations, come into play for state-level action in trying to influence another nation's political election process, in terms of information/propaganda? There's a lot of consternation about Russia's systematic influence campaigns in a variety of European and North American elections. To me, it seems like the people and governments of those countries are justified in being indignant about this. However, it seems equally clear that some forms of public (out in the open) diplomacy, that might affect elections, aren't affronts (or at least are not affronts at the same level). What I'm looking for is a framework from which to assess the ethics of different actions in this area, at a finer level of detail than just utilitarianism or virtue ethics. For utilitarianism, what are the good(s) we are trying to maximize, and how do they relate to the different kinds of actions a nation might take to influence a foreign election? Similarly for virtue ethics, what are the "virtues" of a good nation. Since this only makes sense in a framework of sovereign states, one way to look at this question is, to ask when the nation's sovereignty has been violated by a foreign nation's actions vis a vis their internal electoral process. Even if there are not relatively clear lines to cross, what are the features/dimensions on which to assess where one nation's actions sit. Another feature of this is whether actors from a foreign nation have a different set of ethical constraints from domestic actors. E.g. maybe it is unethical (or less ethical) for foreign actors to buy a large amount of standard political commercial time; an action that is pretty typical for domestic actors. To list some of the assumptions I've made here 

Not every discussion about important topics is a structured logical argument in which you can point out fallacies. Instead (imho) it is better to analyze these types of situations in terms of the rhetorical/persuasive technique(s) being applied. From Aristotle's Rhetoric 

I read your question as indicting taboos as, in some sense, arbitrary. So consider the following possiblities: 

I tend to interpret Quine's conclusion in terms of the readers' side of things: in order to interpret even the most basic, small facet of a scientific result, you need to impose a big background of theory. For an obvious example, take the report that the Higgs Boson has a mass of XXX +/- YYY GeV/c^2; huge amounts of background knowledge are required to even make sense of this one reported number. Even something as basic as "we measured the thickness to be ZZZ mm with calipers" implies a theory that the thickness of the whatever (as opposed to say, its surface roughness) is the salient factor in this context. Similar considerations affect the practitioners' reporting: they can't provide all of the background information so they need to assume (usually implicitly) that the reader will interpret their results in the light of a commonly held theory. This then pushes back into what practitioners actually do: if I can't sensibly communicate it within the theoretical constructs of my scientific community, then it's not worth doing (or if I do it, I'll end up being outside my scientific community). Science has values. Not just that the people of the scientific community have values, but rather the enterprise of doing science imposes/requires a minimal set of values, i.e. things that are deemed "of value". These include things like: complete, transparent, and accurate reporting of findings; reproducibility of the processes used to derive the results; dispassionate reporting et al. When you interpret scientific results you can (or at least should be able to) assume that these results are being reported in accordance with these values. These are the values of science, as an ideal, and in my estimation/view the values that shape the actual practice of science as we know it. You can go down a rabbit hole of the hows/whys/wheres of deviations from these ideals do occur within science and/or when enough of them are violated we are no longer dealing with "True" (Scotsman) science etc. But for the purposes of this discussion, it makes sense to accept that science (or with more detail: sepcific communities with science) has some intrinsic/essential values. That these core values of science affect how results are conveyed and interpreted is a more subtle point, and can be described in a way that makes this interaction less interesting than the theory-ladenness of science. In considering theory ladenness it is relatively easy to come up with counterfactuals: e.g. without special relativity, measuring masses in GeV/c^2 doesn't make sense. Trying to construct the same kind of counterfactuals where the essential values of science are violated leads to situations where you are not dealing with science. Public policy research institutes, which adhere to a different set of values, produce research papers that include specific objective facts, but are not doing science. As I currently understand it, some segments of the biomedical research community have stopped doing (or failed to do) science, since the cherry picking of positive outcomes amounts to incomplete reporting of their results. The point is these core values are, for some contexts, less interesting because they are just part of the background that comes into play when discussing science at all. 

I'm going to discuss this as though it were just a practical problem, when in fact it is a real problem that points to the boundaries of what science can do. Suppose you have a holistic theory where "everything" matters; how are you going to test it? how is it going to make predictions? In this way science, as an endeavor geared towards making testable predictive theories cannot admit too much holism. (To some extend, that is why various forms of pseudoscience incorporate holism: by allowing everything to affect everything else proponents can brush aside apparent contradictions as being caused by one of the uncontrolled contributors). There are areas in science where more limited forms of holism, of a sort, are used. Population genetics (which can, AFAIK, be studied without detailed knowledge of the structure of DNA), some forms of material science (e.g. formulating the dynamics of granular material at a bulk without going into the details of their interaction) etc. And these are interesting/valuable areas of research. 

If you are of the sort who thinks that quantum indeterminacy plays an important role in brain activity, and percolates up to influence our decisions, then yes. Today I choose chocolate over vanilla since a quantum fluctuation that pushes me that way, but could have just as easily pushed me the other way. If this were true, then we'd have truly un-determined decision making since, as far as we can tell, quantum processes involve intrinsic randomness. But you don't need rest on such speculative claims in order to get there. The apparent conflict is between apparently deterministic "choices" -- I choose chocolate because I had vanilla yesterday, and am in a change things up kind of mood -- and apparently un-caused choices -- You're getting up to the counter with no clear decision in mind, but maybe, just below the level of conscious awareness you know that the last time you had chocolate it was really good, and the last time you had vanilla you were not satisfied, plus vanilla is bor... a whiff of vanilla infused perfume "Vanilla!". Are the outcomes of dice rolls un-determined? maybe not in some intrinsic metaphysical sense, but they are in the day-to-day sense. I'm arguing the same for decisions: in terms of understandable, high level descriptions some decisions are un-determined. This high level indeterminancy can arise whether or not the underlying details are intrinsically deterministic or are indeterminant (QM, non-deterministic dualist theories). And it is exactly this high level description of how someone acts vis a vis identifiable causal forces that we care about when assessing the degree to which an agent is considered to have made a decision. This conclusion aligns with D. Dennett's idea of "the kind of free will worth wanting".
