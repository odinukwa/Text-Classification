The closest I can think of is Stone-Geary utility/preferences, where consumption is assumed to provide utility only above a specific level (the $\gamma_i$ parameter in the link), which is usually designated as the "subsistence level". As for how much an economy is above this subsistence threshold, a way to roughly assess this is to calculate what would Total Income be if all people were at the poverty-line-income (each country determines its own poverty line). Then subtract this from the actual Total Income. What is left can be thought of as what the OP is looking for. But calling it "luxury", implies that any consumption above the level guaranteeing mere survival is a luxury. Is it? 

Final NEWS March 20, 2015 : I have e-mailed prof. K. Salyer, one of the authors of the User Guide. In a repeated communication, he verified that both issues (see my answer below, as well as @ivansml answer), do exist: a) The correct equation for the law of motion of consumption is as @ivansml shows b) The number $0.007$ is wrongly called "variance" (p. 11) in the paper. In reality, it is the standard deviation, and indeed such a magnitude is a typical finding in the data (prof. Salyer referenced "p. 22 form ch.1 of Cooley and Prescott's Frontiers of Business Cycle Research). Both mistakes relate to the printed version of the paper. In other words, the simulations behind Figure 1 of the paper are correct: they use the correct equation for consumption, and they use $0.007$ as the standard deviation of the disturbance in the technology process. So it is the second graph below that it is valid. 

To understand why $\alpha$ must be constrained in $(0,1)$, one has to contemplate the meaning of the expression $$\alpha L$$ when $L$ is a "lottery". How is a lottery denoted mathematically? Authors do not agree on that: for example, the way Jahle and Reny define a lottery (a "gamble" in their terminology), a lottery can be written as a vector whose elements are bivariate vectors themselves: $$L=\{(p_1,w_1),...,(p_n, w_n)\}$$ where $p_i$ are probabilities, and $w_i$ are quantitative outcomes. But MasColell, Whinston and Green, define a lottery as a vector containing only the probabilities: $$L=\{p_1,...,p_n\}$$ and so the "Lottery Space" is a vector space, including vectors each containing only probabilities. But in both cases, the authors make clear that an expression like $\alpha L$, when the time comes to translate it into a mathematical operation, denotes a multiplication of only the probabilities linked with $L$ by another probability, $\alpha$. This is implementing the reduction of compound lotteries to simple ones. JR describe it as "the decision maker cares only about effective probabilities of each outcome". MWG call it the "consequentialist premise", that allows them to work only with simple lotteries. So it is not valid to consider $\alpha$ outside $(0,1)$, because it is defined as a probability (the open bounds are used in order to avoid triviality in the statement of the Independence axiom). Also, the above imply that $\alpha$ does not directly interact with the quantitative outcomes of the lottery/gamble... ...which points to a (perhaps interesting, perhaps not) research direction: What can we say (if anything), if we start tweaking the outcomes linked with a lottery? Will "attitude towards risk" get in the way and prevent us from drawing any general conclusions? Or not? 

Gross Domestic Product measures production in terms of value (usually "GDP" alone refers to GDP in real terms, while we add the qualifier "nominal GDP" to indicate that we use current prices). As such an increase in GDP may not be accompanied by an increase in production as measured in quantity, if this is what the OP asks. Even if we take out the effect of price inflation, we may have changes in what is produced, such that fewer units are produced but each of a higher value -higher enough so as the overall effect to be an increase in GDP (i.e. in value terms). Think of a country that produced grain of a given quality. Next year it switches grain variety, and it now cultivates a variety that produces fewer tons of product but it is priced higher because it is considered more healthy. Or think of car production, where we produce 1 million small cheap cars, and next year we switch to high-end cars. We may now produce a much lower quantity of cars, but each cars costs/is priced much more, and overall we may see an increase in the value of GDP (always speaking in real terms here). But if we want to count the number of end-product units, it has decreased. 

(I am not certain of whether I use established English terminology here). The answer is no, because in a communist state (as described by Marx), there are no markets, especially, markets for production factors. And in none of the countries that implemented a socialistic socio-economic system, was labor "directly socialized" -it continued to be considered as owned by each worker individually, and it was priced, bought and sold. And it doesn't matter how this was done, i.e. of whether the wages were determined through some market mechanism or decreed by the state. All it matters is that labor was still private property. 

Hall (2005) mentions Barro's paper twice, but the first one in p. 51 is in the introduction and in order to alert the reader on what to expect. The essential dialogue between the two papers is in p. 56, where, Hall, after presenting his model and its workings, writes: 

Starting from $$Y = A\left( \alpha L^{\rho} + (1-\alpha)K^{\rho} \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}$$ $$...\implies MP_L = \alpha A\cdot\left( \alpha + (1-\alpha)\left(\frac {K}{L}\right)^{\rho} \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}-1}$$ assume that $\rho <0$ (which gives an elasticity of substitution smaller than unity). Then we can write $$MP_L = \frac A {\left( \alpha + (1-\alpha)\left(\frac {L}{K}\right)^{|\rho|} \right)^{\frac{1}{|\rho|}+1}}$$ So $$L\to 0 \implies MP_L \to \frac A { \alpha ^{\frac{1}{|\rho|}+1}} >0 $$ although not infinite. 

If "supply is perfectly inelastic" it cannot be the case that the supplier can "just lower his production". The point of "perfectly inelastic supply", is exactly to represent the case, where the supplier will offer a specific quantity at whatever price, even zero. The classic case here is a good that is it deteriorates quickly in terms of quality or even consumption safety (say fresh foods). The equilibrium price is then determined by demand. If the state appears and wants to take a chunk out of the price by imposing a tax, the tax will fully burden the supplier. Of course this is the static approach. In a dynamic setting, such a situation may for example create incentives for an unofficial market, where the supplier tries to hide sales from the state in order to reduce the tax burden. 

Based on the OP's comment directed at @StevenLandsburg, it appears that what we are discussing here is "same $L$abor amount, more $H$eads". So if currently we have $H = L/40$ we will roughly have $H' = (1/0.8)\cdot(L/40) \Rightarrow H' = 1.25H$. Assuming that there are $25$% more Heads to go to work, this is a redistribution of the same labor income from current earners to non-earners, possibly partly offset by the reduction of unemployment benefits and other transfers that are somehow related to non-earners, which could materialize as lower taxes. Another interesting aspect here would be the effect on savings: if savings are non-linearly related to income, and then, reasonably expected to be a convex function of it (the higher the income, the higher proportion of it is saved), then such a redistribution would lower savings in favor of consumption (but only partially, since part of this +$25$% would come from households that had already some earners, thus tending to re-instate family income). In any case, lower savings would mean lower available funds for loans and investments. What would that do to capital accumulation, capital level and hence profit maximizing demand for labor? Also, part of the non-earners that they will now go to paid work, may have been engaged in "non-market", "home production". What will happen with this aspect? In other words, as comments suggested this needs a fully specified model, even if it is only a highly abstract one, and depending on the assumptions of the model, even within the "usual" variety of assumptions, conclusions will most probably differ. 

The government cuts public spending but continues to "run a deficit by borrowing from the central bank." This is the polite way to say "increase yearly the money supply by an amount equal to the government's deficit". So the money supply will also increase in the second year, albeit by a smaller amount than before. But increase it will. 

If a consumer's demand for a good is perfectly inelastic with respect to the price, this means that the consumer is prepared to spend all his available income to that one good, even if this means that he won't consume anything else. This means that the consumer has lexicographic preferences, with this one good above everything else. Lexicographic preferences are not continuous, and so they cannot be represented by a continuous utility function. They have indifference "curves" that are single points, etc. So the case of perfectly inelastic demand represents an "exception" at a deeper level than for example Giffen goods represent. Giffen goods are manageable in the context of "usual" preferences, tweaked but not scrapped altogether. Finally, note that "perfectly inelastic demand" represented as a straight vertical line, does not answer the question "what will happen if, given his budget constraint, the consumer cannot afford to buy the specific quantity $\bar q$?" Will he buy as much as his budget $B$ allows, or will he buy nothing? If, when he cannot afford the desired quantity $\bar q$, he buys as much as he can, then in reality the demand curve becomes negatively sloped after a price level, and it acquires a "forced" elasticity, dictated by the budget constraint: 

is a total dead-end, because exactly the same thing could be argued for any instrument you might choose. It would be my suggestion to not use such vague and general arguments in your paper. On the other hand, the endogeneity issue is not about whether the suspect regressor is correlated with some other variable. Each and everyone variable in the world can be said to be corrleated with at least one other variable. The issue is whether this other variable is also correlated with the dependent variable. To consider the example offered in a comment by the OP, "past work for the government" may be correlated with "party membership" indeed. But is "past work for the government" correlated with the OP's dependent variable? Namely, does it really live inside the error term of the regression? Selection of instruments is one of the few instances in econometric work where the verbal argument dominates. As the answer by @ColeTrumbo excellently put it, 

The concept of "balanced growth path" in economics incorporates three characteristics at the same time (related to the main macroeconomic aggregates): 1) Growth rates are constant (reflecting a notion of equilibrium/stability) 2) Growth rates are strictly positive (otherwise the economy would eventually vanish) 3) Growth rates are equal to each other (hence there is "balance" and no macroeconomic aggregate becomes negligible relative to another) To obtain the first characteristic you have to impose that the derivative of the growth rate with respect to time is zero. Nothing weird about that, just a valid mathematical operation.
