When world building I find the most valuable questions to all be about the forces driving everything that happens. What is the economy of your civilizations? What do your people eat? How do they get energy, tools, clothing, housing, and transportation? Where does their waste go? Worlds feel really contrived and false when a city has no way to feed itself or when a village exists in some dramatic location for no practical reason. If there are rulers, what governs the flow of power in your world? How does one become and stay a ruler? What prevents someone else from usurping the ruler? If you are inventing a species of animal, what does it eat? How does it reproduce? Bad world building results in predators who roar while hunting and who outnumber their prey. 

One danger would be of going bankrupt. Nebulae are not super rich sources of matter. From wikipedia: "Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created on Earth â€“ a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms." $URL$ Also nebulae are huge - "Most nebulae are of vast size, even millions of light years in diameter." A second danger would be from radiation. While a Kardashev II civ is likely to have technology well beyond that needed to shield against mere isotopes, the debris from a supernova is highly radioactive. The earlier you start mining after a supernova, the better. The matter will be less diffuse and it will be composed of more exotic isotopes. I can think of a few ways to mine a nebula, but it's hard to imagine the economics of a K II civ. They have enough energy available to move their star! $URL$ They could send lots of mining ships into the nebula at high speed. The ships would be variants on the Busard ramjet design and would use magnetic fields to gather together the diffuse material. A much better idea would probably be to guide matter by throwing gas giant planets (or even stars) into the nebula. The gravity well of these objects would tend to concentrate the diffuse gas. A third option would be to push some of the gas around using either the light or solar wind of their home star and focusing that into a beam which they can scan across the nebula as needed. Honestly though, I can't think of any reason to bother. What could a K II civ want to make that would require more matter than is available in a few gas giant planets? The only thing i can think of would be a star, and stars are a dime a dozen. In order to get to the nearest nebula, you would probably have to pass by dozens of stars. The only thing I can think of is that they might scan through a nebula looking for the blasted fragments of the planets that formerly orbited the star that exploded. There might very well be unusual objects left over from the supernova. For example, large carbon rich planets are hypothesized to have enormous diamond crystals inside their cores. It might be amusing to a K II civ to grab a moon-sized diamond crystal and use it for an embassy or something. "This old thing? Oh, it's just a moon-sized diamond that we carved into an embassy and towed into your solar system. It's no big deal." 

Having armor be volume limited is weird, but OK it's your world. Maybe they have some kind of novel power source? Normally when weight is critical, the best armor uses extremely hard materials on the outer surface (ceramic seems to be the state of the art), then there is an air gap, then a material with a high tensile strength to weight ratio (kevlar, titanium, or steel depending on the application), and lastly there is some kind of a spall liner usually made from kevlar fabric. The hard outer surface breaks the projectile into pieces and slows those pieces down. The middle layer absorbs the remaining kinetic energy of the now shattered projectile. Finally, the spall liner catches fragments of the middle layer of armor which break loose at high velocity, ideally without catching fire (thus kevlar rather than UHMWPE). This tends to use up a lot of space though. There is another class of armor called reactive armor which consists of a sandwich of two steel plates with plastic explosive in the middle. This is mainly useful for resisting shaped charges, but I think any shaped charge weapon is going to be out of your league. If weight is of no consequence, then extremely dense materials become appealing. I think you will find very few examples since this is essentially never the case, but some tank armors incorporate depleted uranium in the above layer sandwich. Ceramic is still ideal for the outer layer, but you would likely want to use tungsten carbide because it's extremely hard and extremely dense. You would likely back this with depleted uranium or a high strength steel. .50 caliber ammunition comes in a wide variety of types. $URL$ I couldn't find the video you reference, but it likely involved regular ball ammunition. (Copper over a steel core.) APDS (armor piercing discarding sabot) uses a small, very pointy tungsten rod wrapped in a plastic sleeve (the sabot). When fired, the sabot breaks off, leaving the tungsten rod to impact the target on its own. Penetrating power of a bullet tends to be closely related to the pounds per square inch it can exert on the target. Since tungsten is far denser than steel, a tungsten bullet with the same weight and and length as a steel bullet will penetrate far more armor. The M903 APDS round will reportedly penetrate 34mm of rolled homogeneous steel armor (the default armor plate) at 500 meters. My point is that 30mm of the best armor you can get might very well resist a single shot of .50 cal ball, but would likely succumb to several shots of .50 APDS. side question 1: Pretty much all armor is wrecked at the point where the bullet contacts it. Ceramic armors are created as many individual blocks and the entire block shatters when hit. If accurate repeated fire or extremely high volumes of fire result in multiple bullet hits to the same location, all armors will eventually fail. side question 2: More armor means better protection. That said, another option would be to just add a few redundant electronic boxes which take over when the first one is damaged. This is standard practice in spacecraft. Computers are tiny, light, and fairly cheap. Armor is big, very heavy, and expensive. A really clever drone might even use multiple processors in parallel in order to process a lot of data really quickly in the middle of combat, then as those processors become destroyed it might switch to a redundancy mode, making its behavior more sluggish but stubborn. This might add some drama to a scene involving trying to kill one of these drones? 

The problem with all of the answers I've seen thus far is that heating up the planet means the climate will be wetter, not drier. Hotter temperatures means faster evaporation, but that water doesn't stay in the atmosphere forever. It all comes down as precipitation. Hotter temperatures makes for more jungles, not more deserts. Ice ages make for larger deserts. Until, that is, you reach a sufficient temperature to cause a run away greenhouse effect wherein 100% of the surface water evaporates/boils into the atmosphere. This is a run-away effect because water vapor is a greenhouse gas. There is no stable point where the oceans are just like, half the size they are today. Once this process begins, you inevitably end up with another Venus-like world with surface temperatures too hot for any surface water. There will be no oxygen and no humans. 

Swarm intelligence (i.e. emergent intelligence) is certainly possible because that is how our brains work. Individual cells each decide where they need to be located and what they need to do. No individual cell has any idea what the bigger picture is, but it just follows a simple set of rules. The end result of this is that after a few years the swarm of human cells can hold a conversation with you. Relevant questions regarding using ants rather than neurons to form a swarm intelligence would include whether the ants are able to maintain a coherent map of network connections between ants despite individuals being mobile (as opposed to neurons which are largely stationary). Another question would be whether the ants are able to maintain a network connectivity with high enough bandwidth and low enough latency. I would suggest that your ants use optical communications rather than pheromonal (which is what real ants use). Each ant could have a gland which glows to transmit light (like a firefly gland but smaller). The gland should be recessed in a mirrored pocket on the body. The recessed pocket will make the signal narrow, so only a few ants will be able to see it (thus reducing the problem of cross-talk and increasing the signal strength to the chosen ant). The mirrored interior of the pocket would maximize the efficiency of the light emitter. There should also be a light receiver, which would be an eye which has been optimized for looking at narrow viewing angles at just the specific wavelength used by the trasmitters. In other words, a telephoto lens. Each ant should have multiple transmitters and receivers so she can communicate with multiple other ants simultaneously. (Many neurons either transmit or receive from multiple neurons at once.) Transmitters and receivers should be steerable - either on stalks, or perhaps more robustly mounted to the carapace in ball and socket joints (like human eyeballs are mounted to the skull). Ants which are currently tasked with thinking should avoid moving around a lot to avoid breaking connections. They should also hang out in three dimensional environments like large caverns where they can hang from the walls and ceiling allowing thousands of ants to talk to thousands of other ants. This will improve data processing speed. Obstructing line of sight will impede efficiency. Each ant needs to have a name (in computer terms, an address). Each ant would memorize the names of all ants it connects to. If two ants lose connection they each broadcast their names until they are able to reconnect. Each ant should probably also have a youthful understudy who is expected to take over that network node when its elder dies. That way the mind would outlast the lifespan of individual ants. Lastly, nobody can answer what kinds of evolutionary pressure would result in sentience. We've only seen it happen a single time (in the case of human ancestors) and we have no idea what was different about this situation. I would suggest you make up anything that seems plausible to you. Whatever your explanation, I would urge you to make it an unusual collection of events that has not happened before with other organisms. 

The Earth has roughly another 3 billion years before it becomes engulfed in by the sun. That is a shockingly long period of time in which a lot of decay and crustal churn can occur. While some evidence of human civilization will almost certainly exist, I think the real question is how easy it will be to find it, because evidence that exists under under 2 miles of rock, there is essentially zero chance that it will be found. If you want to study a given era in Earth's geological history, you need to find out where rocks from that era still exist. Then you need to figure out where those rocks are not covered by hundreds of feet of other rocks, underneath a glacier, buried under soil, under hundreds of feet of lake or ocean sediment, and ideally not underneath more than a few feet of water. For example, we know nothing about the fossils on almost the entire continent of Antarctica because it's covered in ice. It could have been crawling with dinosaur cities and we would never know. Most metals oxidize very quickly. Glass breaks and is weathered into sea glass. Plastic breaks down into tiny particles very quickly, and then will likely oxidize. Even granite, if exposed to weather will crumble over time. $URL$ Especially since, in the time it takes to evolve new sentient species (it seems to be a minimum of around 3 million years) there are guaranteed to be numerous ice ages, resulting in the soil of higher latitudes being scraped up and ground to rubble by glaciers. Also, no offense to Molot, but I don't think mines will last very long at all. They collapse surprisingly quickly, and a lot of mining techniques intentionally collapse or fill any excavated caverns. $URL$ There was a kind of cheesy TV show that dealt with this topic. $URL$ 

Hydrogen doesn't exist on its own in the atmosphere of any planet with oxygen (or probably even most planets without oxygen unless the planet is a gas giant). Hydrogen is always part of another molecule - on Earth's atmosphere this is most often in the form of water, methane, or ammonia. If hydrogen gas was present, it has such a low density that it would rise higher and higher in the atmosphere until it was on the edge of space. Then the solar wind would knock it loose from the planet. I'm not really sure how scarce water is on your planet. If water vapor could not be condensed out of the atmosphere, and ground water could not be accessed by drilling a well, I would recommend looking for natural gas or oil deposits. Both of those produce water when burned. It is hard to imagine how fossil fuels could be produced without available water, but maybe it works on your world? 

GrinningX has quite a good answer but I would like to amend it slightly. The stats quoted appear to refer to a ground burst. Ground bursts are not thought to be targeted against cities because air bursts are more damaging to them. Ground bursts are expected to be used against hardened targets like ICBM silos. However, if a 1.2MT ground burst did occur in your city it the fridge owner would die for sure. Ground bursts generate enormous quantities of fallout. (Air bursts generate almost no fallout.) Fallout is created when energetic neutrons in the fireball touch heavy matter, converting it into unstable isotopes. Air burst neutrons interact with gasses, and the radioactive isotopes they make from this gas tends to stay aloft. The fallout from such a ground burst would be lethal for weeks to months - far too long to be hiding inside a refrigerator. On the other hand, an air burst produces almost no radiation on the ground (neither prompt nor fallout) so the radiation shielding would be largely unneeded. The most important need would be (in this following order of events) 1) protection from the flash (just being inside your house and away from windows is probably good enough), 2) protection from blast (sturdy steel construction and being securely bolted to a sturdy foundation would keep you alive), 3) protection from the heat and fumes from your house burning down, and 4) a mechanism to allow you to exit the fridge even though it has been buried by the debris of your house. Numbers 3 and 4 are quite a bit more difficult and complicated than 1 and 2. For surviving the fire, maybe some kind of hand-cranked air pump which pulled air in from outside and percolated it through a container of water (to cool the air and remove smoke)? That would help, but would not do anything to reduce carbon monoxide or lethal carbon dioxide levels. Heat would be less of a problem. Fridges are designed to be insulated, so just make sure the gaskets are fire resistant and increase the R value enough to survive. I'm honestly not sure how to handle egress. It's hard to guess what debris will be on the fridge and how it will be shaped. I don't have any good ideas for this one.
