What drove anti-capitalist sentiments from Kazakh intellectuals and economists in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union? It is my understanding that Kazakhstan was a low level resource provider in the chain of manufacturing and it was left largely to its own devices after breaking away from the Soviet Union. Why then would intellectuals argue that capitalism would bring ruin to the post-Soviet state? It would seem that they would support an economic paradigm that was at least different from communism which had brought them to the state of relative poverty in the first place. 

Actually there's really no obvious answer. That's the beauty of history; it is subject to multiple interpretations. First off, semantically, we have to define what it means to be "developing" or "progressing." It should be noted that certain scholars (especially Petrach, who is mentioned by name in this Wikipedia article) referred to the medieval period (roughly the 5th Century to the 15th Century) as "surrounded by darkness and dense gloom." Petrach felt that the era was marked by darkness: the so-called "Dark Ages." However, that's certainly not a matter of fact. Rather, it's a matter of historical interpretation; a question of historiography. To offer a competing interpretation, Petrach wrote these comments in the early 14th Century, near the end but still solidly within the period that most historians now consider the Middle Ages. Surely a man living in the time period he is criticizing as being the "Dark Ages" is not unlike what Owen Wilson experienced in Midnight in Paris: the yearning or longing for a time thought to be more exhilarating, more artful, more plein de vie simply because one was not part of it. Second, even taking Petrach's comment at face value, his characterization is at best extreme and at worst somewhat ignorant. The period was marked by significant technological, artistic, religious and economic advancements. For example, accurate mechanical time pieces (time pieces using an escapement mechanism--a technology that is still employed today in high end mechanical watches) were devised during this time period. The printing press was famously invented by Gutenberg in the mid-15th Century. Metal working was highly sophisticated during this period producing a variety of custom-made fully articulated armoured suits for both practical (military) purposes as well as for parades/ceremony. Not to mention the variety of weaponry including crossbows, swords, siege devices (trebuchet, catapaults) and cannons. See here and here. But to answer your question: "what kept the people of Europe from advancing," a variety of factors influenced Petrach's characterization which has wound up as somewhat of a colloquialism. First, Europe was riddled (or "plagued," if you'll excuse the pun) with disease. The Black Death was estimated to kill somewhere between 30% to over 50% of the population of the European continent. Second, the theory that we as a people identify first with a nation or a country is a somewhat recent development in human history. In the Middle Ages people identified and pledged their allegiance to a "lord" or "master," a concept which formed the basis of feudalism. This sort of "governmental" power structure was not really conducive to getting a lot of things done at a macroeconomic or political level. "Lords" were highly concerned with consolidating land and power resulting in constant infighting, raids, sieges and cutting other people's heads off. See here. Just that's a quick answer; by NO MEANS intended to be comprehensive. There's much more research to be done. 

Interesting question. Believe me I'm no military expert but the strategic value of motorized infantry is two fold: (1) Speed. As you mentioned before, this is probably the greatest advantage. (2) Towing capacity. Obviously trucks, motorbikes and the like optimized for military usage have a much greater towing capacity. They are able to deploy heavier equipment, weapons or provisions into the field allowing infantry to spend more man hours on the ground. Otherwise foot soldiers would rely primarily on...well foot. Marches. Some trucks may have pintle mounted weapons like light machine guns or grenade launchers. The problem is that many motorized trucks that are not cavalry (i.e. tanks, APCs, IFVs) are not armored enough to provide a real tactical advantage in terms of infantry engagements. But the greatest power lies in rapidly deploying forces to areas of need allowing quicker and more precise responses to enemy advances. In other words speed and carrying power are probably the biggest advantages. Take a look at these: M3 Halftrack German Armored Recon. Vehicles Soviet armored car 

The gladitorial games were largely thought to be adopted by the Campanians and found their way to Rome through the Etruscans. From this site: 

Notwithstanding all the argumentative comments, supra, I will try to answer OP's question by saying that quite a bit of power was given to the fed. gov't to protect the rights of freedmen following the civil war. The Force Acts of 1870 and 1871 were criminal codes that protected not only the civil, but also many of the political rights of African Americans. The KKK Act of 1871 also gave the President the power to suspend habeus corpus in order to combat white supremacist organizations. Not to mention the Freedman's Act (1865) which established the Bureau of Freedmen which was used to aide the transition of former slaves into freedmen, often by assisting in employment and protecting civil rights. In other words, following the end of the Civil War there was a lot of effort on the part of the fed. gov't to ensure that freed slaves were enfranchised and KEPT enfranchised. This was the so called period of (Military) Reconstruction which as @Razie Mah has stated included the occupation of the South by Union troops. But by the early 1870s the acts had lost a lot of steam. (*) The Coup de Grâce came in the so called Corrupt Bargain of 1876. Although Hayes (the Republican candidate) lost the popular vote, Republicans, fearing that a Democratic candidate would hold office and destroy the progress made by Reconstruction, offered to withdraw Union troops in exchange for the presidency. The Democrats happily took the offer and in 1877 Union troops were withdrawn. Almost immediately after the South began processes to disenfranchise freed Blacks through Jim Crow and "separate but equal" facilities. The political progress of freedmen came to a grinding halt arguably following the withdrawal of Union soldiers. By 1896 the Supreme Court's decision in 1896 solidified de jure race segregation which would not really be disturbed until the 1950s and 60s. (*) I seem to recall that many Northern states started to feel sympathetic toward Southerners during the period after the civil war, which would perhaps explain the strong popular vote for the democratic candidate Tilden in 1876. 

Now as a caveat I must warn you that the question you are asking is pretty specific but I'm going to give you a general idea of the efficacy of French foot soldiers against the English forces. Firstly, what you say is generally correct. French armour at the time was extremely well manufactured and using slopes and various inclinations in the armour, arrows were generally ineffective at full penetration of steel plate even at short distances. With that said, because high quality steel was expensive many soldiers especially footsoldiers, who were generally lower in rank then their mounted counterparts, could not afford full steel plate armour of the grade necessary to prevent arrow penetration. In this case, wrought iron armour or armour mix and matched from different craftsmen was used which a) decreased the overall effectiveness of the armour and b) caused certain parts of the armour, especially limb armour, to be relatively much weaker than breastplate armour. In this case it would be safe to say that while the French had superior armour, the prohibitive cost allowed English longbowmen to still remain effective at least on ground troops. With that, running in 50 - 80 pounds of plate armour made footmen easy targets. Fatigue, heat exhaustion, and time wasted stepping over fallen comrades also hampered the effectiveness of French ground troops, giving longbowmen time to fire at the French line. In addition, like you said, I can't imagine those who did make it with a chest full of arrows being particularly effective at swinging a weapon. As per the rest of the French army, English longbowsmen trained their arrows on the horses of charging knights. Because horses were generally less armoured, crippling a horse and throwing the rider was an effective way of eliminating mounted knights' combat effectiveness. In this case, the longbowmen excelled, but at an effective range of about 220 - 300 yards, a horse in full gallop could cross that in under a minute giving the archer about a dozen shots before the enemy was upon them. Furthermore, equipped with better armour, I'm unsure if the longbow was effective in crippling the mounted knights of the French. In short, I theorize that longbowmen were quite effective in disrupting the attack strategies of French footmen. But as per the horse back riders, without more data it's hard to say. As an aside: This video on youtube describes a process where arrows were shot at armour and effectively stopped by the plate. Some of the comments are worth reading too. $URL$ I don't know if this is applicable but I hope it can guide further research.

Also supported by the Wikipedia page on Gladitorial games. However, various sites also espouse that the first Gladitorial games, which took place approximately 310 BC; almost fifty years before their appearance in Rome, did not originate in (what we now call) Italy at all. Rather they were of Greek origin. 

Don't know how helpful this is, but I think the real question you want to ask is whether or not there are documents publicly available concerning the Japanese military from World War II. Many such documents, especially official records concerning various crimes against humanity, (i.e. The Nanjing incident, Bataan Death March or the Bangka Island Massacre in Indonesia read at your own risk) were likely destroyed or hidden at the end of the war. It is difficult to tell whether surviving military records could be accessible. My bet is that this type of research is best conducted on site. In other words by visiting Japan. 

There's a number of superficial differences between slavery in the United States and serfdom in Russia before 1861. Serfdom differs from slavery fundamentally in that serfdom ties workers to the land. US slavery tied an individual to another individual. I believe there is a minor flaw in @DarekWędrychowski's answer in that serfs were not owned per say by nobility. Rather the serfs were tied to the land. When land was sold, the serfs who resided on it were sold with it. @DarekWędrychowski's answer also implies that serfs were free to pursue an education or somehow improve their condition, but I don't believe this is correct. Although there may not have been any explicit stipulation in the law that barred serfs from an education etc., societal pressures were likely significant enough that no serf ever realized this potential. Serfs were technically not enslaved. They were not the property of nobles. They could accumulate money and purchase objects, perhaps even accumulate enough to purchase land, essentially buying their own freedom. But to my knowledge I am not aware of any such cases occurring. In fact, land prices were likely kept so prohibitively high that a serf saving money for his entire life would not collect even close to the amount required. Now I say superficial because despite the aforementioned differences in ideology, for all intents and purposes serfdom essentially resembled slavery. Serfs had literally no civil rights. They could be beat, punished harshly, divided from their family, starved etc. I don't believe serfs could be killed without consequences. It is my understanding that slaves in the US could be killed. 

This is a really tough question to answer. History is not just the study of what happened in the past and when it happened. Sometime around sophomore or junior year of high school, more perceptive students pick up on the fact that history is about the interpretation of various events and the sheer breadth and variety of interpretations is what makes the study of history interesting. In terms of how we can differentiate history from other areas of study. The short answer is that we really can't. History itself is a blanket term that covers a lot of different areas of study. For example, the study of the mathematical concept of volume and the study of, let's say, World War II can both focus on the certain moments that "motivated" these events. But one may require quite a substantial understanding of mathematics; both however are indisputably the study of history. As you mentioned history can be considered a social science. With other social sciences like sociology, economics, psychology, history uses elements of the scientific method. In fact in terms of research methodologies I would strongly recommend The Craft of Research by Booth et. al. that really lays out indiscriminately of field of study, the various elements that constitute good argumentation which is what historical research is based upon. I always consider history to be a social science. Science is always changing. New frontiers are always being discovered and old theorems disproved. History is the same. For example, in grade school, many kids are taught that the ancient Pyramid of Giza was built by enslaved Jews. But in fact, pyramids were largely built by skilled laborers and farmers who were drafted to perform the duties of pyramid construction. This huge change in the way we think about who built the pyramids didn't just happen overnight. Extensive research was conducted and different areas of study (including archaeology) were incorporated to provide the evidence to convince people that this in fact was the truth. History is not set in stone. In fact, history constantly evolves, just like the sciences, to reflect our interpretation of the world. After all, if we didn't support historical discoveries with evidence who would believe them? In short, there is no easy way to differentiate what is "history" and what is everything else. The fact is that because history is the study of the journey of humanity through time in all its various angles, it invariably must cover everything that is of interest to humanity. So there is the history of science, history of computing, history of ancient China, history of archaeology, even history of the various fields that were studied in relation to archaeology before archaeology became recognized as its own field of study. I know this was long, but I hope it helps you understand that history is not an isolated field. It shares its research methodology with the sciences and draws on every conceivable area of study to formulate interpretations that can be supported with hard evidence. P.S. this may also help you understand what historians do: $URL$
