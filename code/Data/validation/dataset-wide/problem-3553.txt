Over training is a common problem in some athletic circles where raw power is desired, but excessive training builds up endurance instead. Boxing comes to mind and can be spotted when a boxer doesn't break a sweat in the early rounds. 

A search for "crockpot breakfast" or "slow cooker breakfast" will turn up wonder results. You can do the prep at night, start the cooker, and have to do nothing in the morning but eat. The only downside is many of the recipes can't be scaled down below two servings. So you'll need to find a friend to eat the other half. On the plus side, even if you waste half the meal, they're still cheaper than the cost of most fast food breakfasts and healthier too. 

If you're preparing yourself for exertion in a hot environment, wearing more layers will help condition your body and make it easier. For general fitness, though, it has a nominal effect. 

I believe you're looking for a personal dietitian. There are few tools that can replace that kind of skill and education. There are some incredibly strict diets that do dictate every meal, but most people fail with them because they quickly find portions they don't like and it falls apart from there. If you really need the structure of a planned diet and you don't want to hire a personal consultant, you could pick-up an old Weight Watchers or other national diet plan and flip to the maintenance section. They often have example meals that you could take as your plan. As for using a calories in/out calculator, those are just guides and it would be better to monitor your body to see if you need an over all increase or decrease. Trying to plan out by individual day activity isn't practical. 

First, I'd suggest you learn about your own sleep patterns. Lifehacker had a nice article on technology that can be helpful. By keeping closer track of the experiments you've done that are mentioned above you might notice things like, you need two days of consistency to make staying away from screens to be effective or some such. Irregular sleep patterns (sleeping in until noon on the weekend) will definitely sabotage your goals. You're not doing yourself any favors by sleeping in excessively on the weekend. 30 minutes is one thing, but more than that and it is no wonder you don't feel tired at a normal time that evening. You've listed the normal suggestions for falling asleep faster and you may be one of the people who simply can't fall asleep quickly. I was that way for +30 years. What really cured my insomnia was my son's birth. Sounds weird given the typical new parent up all night stories, but the truth was that it fixed my attitude. Knowing that there was no way to get a solid 8 hours of sleep and I had to take it when I could get it trained me to go to bed after finishing my evening work. 9:30pm and I was in bed! Get a few hours of sleep before my 2am calling. In a matter of weeks I went from staring at the ceiling for hours to falling asleep within minutes of lying down. All because there was no option to sleep in late or make it up another time. 

It has been said many times, but bears repeating: weight loss is achieved primarily through diet, not exercise. If you're trying to lose weight, focus on how much and how often you're eating first. Anyway, the thing you want to do is to keep your metabolism going and not let your body perceive that it is starving. Eating early in the morning after you wake up is a good way to get it started. If you can, eat a meal or small snack every 2-3 hours. Nuts, fruit, some raw vegetables, or what have you. Post workout, have something with a bit of natural sugar (e.g. fruit) within 15 minutes and protein (e.g. skim milk) within 30. Milk is actually a great post-evening workout food because the proteins take a long time to break down and will be present in your body for a good portion of your sleep. 

Running shoes will help protect your feet by adding more cushion or encouraging better stride (go for these!). However, running long distances is not the best method for improving performance in tennis or soccer. Both of those sports are more focused on short sprints with frequent stops which demand different muscle fibers than developed in long distance running and different tolerances for lactic acid. We had our tennis team focus on sprint exercises and drills that simulated the stop and go motion and we had better results than when we'd tell them to run 5k. 

Go to a store that specializes in running. They will have the equipment and expertise to diagnose your stride and suggest improvements. A lot of people overlook the importance of having a running coach, thinking running is "natural" so they must be doing it correctly. The truth is, many people have less than ideal stride and need to practice foot placement if not use corrective shoes. 

Those lists typically calculate total calories expended during the activity. Those lists are better used as a guide for what types of activities you should be doing, but for any detailed daily tracking, you would need individual monitoring tools. By the same token, using the calorie listing from a package of food only tells you what an average item offers up and doesn't address the complexities that cause the body to retain or pass nutrients. 

Improving forearm strength is usually done through a combination of exercises. Grippers are good and generally you squeeze, hold for a second, and then slowly release. Repeat until you're too sore to continue. Do it again the next day. If your hotel rooms have door molding, you can practice finger tip hangs from them. Improve your technique. Staying over your feet more, using your legs more than your arms, and using locked out arms rather than bent will all improve the duration you can use your forearms. 

Answer 1: They physics is somewhat tricky since so much depends on the exact angle and the distribution of weight on your body. A better approach is just to measure by putting a scale under your hands and do a diamond push-up (so both your hands fit on the scale). See what the scale reads at the bottom of the push-up versus the top. Take the average and you're done. Answer 2: Unless you're going perfectly up and down, you're not lifting the full mass.
