If I understand this correctly, then the answer is no. If an ideal $I$ has a basis of the desired form, then clearly any element of the ring of integers is congruent to a rational integer modulo $I$. But this implies that $I$ is a product of ideals of inertia degree $1$. Thus if $\alpha$ is the cube of an ideal of degree $2$, such a basis cannot exist. 

who started investigating quadratic forms with coefficients in polynomial rings. Dedekind's and Weber's contributions have already been mentioned, but not those of Robert König, who investigated the connection between quadratic function fields and quadratic forms with polynomial coefficients in various publications prior to Artin (and perhaps just as unknown as Heine's contribution): 

Thus Artin verified the Riemann hypothesis for specific examples of quadratic extensions, F.K. Schmidt dervied the functional equation and the rationality for general extensions, Hasse proved the RH for curves of genus 1, and Weil gave the proof for curves (and extended the conjecture to varieties of arbitrary dimension). 

For irreducible cubics, the answer is provided by cyclotomy: cubic extensions with square discriminants are cyclic, hence cyclotomic. Computing the possible discriminants for reducible cubics seems at least feasible. For general polynomials, I predict trouble ahead. In the 1930s, Udo Wegner tried to prove results in the direction of "if the discriminant of an irreducible polynomial looks like the discriminant of a polynomial with Galois group G, then it must have Galois group G" (I think G was the Galois group of binomial extensions generated by $x^n-a$), but I would not trust any of his results without proving them myself. He wrote one article together with Reichardt, whose results can be trusted: 

The splitting of the Galois group of Hilbert class fields of an extension field is discussed in the following articles 

A different idea is looking at the tangent plane in $(1,0,0)$. It intersects the surface in a singular cubic, which can be parametrized via sweeping lines and produces the parametrization $$ X_1 = 1, \quad X_2 = \frac{3t}{b+at^3}, \quad X_2 = \frac{3t^2}{b+at^3}. $$ By looking at the tangent plane at these rational points I would get a 2-parameter family of rational points; the calculations are, however, quite involved. So: 

There are a lot of results in elementary number theory that can be proved with the quadratic reciprocity law. In such a proof you usually have to invert some Jacobi symbol $(a/b)$ and then reduce the numerator modulo the denominator. For number fields that are not Euclidean with respect to some simple map you have a problem if you want to follow this route (the same goes for applications of quadratic and higher residues to cryptography, although this is mostly a theoretical business). In principle, Dedekind-Hasse will also do the trick in some cases. If the ring of integers you're interested in is not Euclidean for the canonical norm, the first idea is to modify it. You could give prime ideals a different weight (weighted norms), or allow division chains in which the norm does not necessarily get smaller in every step (k-stage Euclidean rings), or try some version of Dedekind-Hasse. But if (given a pair $(a,b)$ of elements in a ring) you want to make the norm of $ka-bq$ small, you need more than just the knowledge that a suitable $k$ exists: you need a method for finding $k$ (in addition to finding $q$), perhaps by showing that you can select it from a finite set of elements with bounded norm or something similar. Edit. The Euclidean algorithm is closely related to continued fractions, and the latter are routinely used for doing calculations of units and ideal class groups of real quadratic number fields. For number fields that admit a Euclidean algorithm, something similar can be done: Hurwitz and Mathews worked out a theory of continued fractions over the Gaussian integers, and people like Arwin, Trinks, Degel, Lakein, Stein etc. generalized this to complex Euclidean number fields and used it for computing units and class numbers. I am not aware of too many recent contributions in this direction, but a short search has at least revealed D. Fried, Reduction theory over quadratic imaginary fields, T. Number Theory 2005. 

I'm interested in the following symmetric functions $s_k: \mathbb{R}_+^{k}\mapsto\mathbb{R_+}$: \begin{align*} s_k(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_k)&= \int\limits_{0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_{k-1}<t_k=1} e^{-(t_1-t_0) x_1} e^{-(t_2-t_1)x_2}\dots e^{-(t_k-t_{k-1})x_k}dt_1 \dots dt_{k-1} \\ &=\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{e^{-x_i}} {\displaystyle\prod_{\substack{j=1,\dots,n\\ j\ne i}}(x_j-x_i)} \end{align*} The formula on the second line holds whenever the $x_i$ are all distinct; however it becomes degenerate if $x_i=x_j$ for some $i\ne j$. Question: is there some "nice" pattern for the closed form expressions one obtains when some of the $x_i$ coincide? (Examples below.) [ One motivation: consider a continuous-time Markov chain, with state space $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$, with rate $q_{ij}$ of jumping from state $i$ to state $j$ for $i\ne j$, and total rate $\lambda_i=\sum_{j\ne i} q_{ij}$ of leaving state $i$. Suppose the chain starts in state $1$ at time $0$. Consider the event that during the time-interval $[0,1]$, the chain follows precisely the path $1\to2\to\dots\to (k-1)\to k$ and then stays in state $k$ until the end of the interval (making $k-1$ jumps in all). This event has probability $q_{12}\dots q_{(k-1)k}s_k(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_k)$. ] Anyway: everything is nice and smooth and closed-form expressions for cases with repeated entries can straightforwardly be derived (using, say, L'Hôpital or whatever) - however the details appear to get messy quite quickly. I'm wondering if there is some convenient or systematic way to write those expressions (other than just calculating each case). For example $s_2(x, y)=(e^{-x}-e^{-y})/(y-x)$, and then $s_2(x, x)=e^{-x}$. Taking e.g. $k=4$, we get (I think) \begin{align*} s_4(x,x,y,y)&=\frac{2(e^{-x}-e^{-y})}{(x-y)^3}+\frac{(e^{-x}+e^{-y})}{(x-y)^2} \\ s_4(x,x,x,y)&=\frac{e^{-y}-e^{-x}}{(x-y)^3}-\frac{e^{-y}}{(x-y)^2}+ \frac{e^{-y}}{2(x-y)} \\ s_4(x,y,z,z)&=\frac{e^{-x}}{(z-x)^2(y-x)} + \frac{e^{-y}}{(z-y)^2(x-y)} \\ &\,\,\,\,\,\,\,+e^{-z}\left\{\frac{(z-x)+(z-y)+(z-x)(z-y)+z^2}{(z-x)^2(z-y)^2}\right\}. \end{align*} I'm aware that these things can be written in terms of multiple integrals with gamma densities; for example, if $k=k_1+\dots+k_m$ and there are $k_i$ arguments $x_i$ for each $i$, then I think \begin{equation*} s_k(\dots)=\int\limits_{0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_{m-1}<t_m=1} \prod_{i=1}^m \left\{\frac{(t_i-t_{i-1})^{k_i-1}}{(k_i-1)!} e^{-(t_i-t_{i-1})x_i}\right\}dt_1\dots dt_{m-1}, \end{equation*} but I'm not sure that leads anywhere particularly nice. Perhaps (beguiled by the beautiful form in the case of all $x_i$ distinct) I'm looking for something unreasonable, and these things just are what they are. Then again maybe someone has something nice to point out! 

This doesn't look true as stated. What matters is something like the perimeter of the sites of the path (or of the smallest-perimeter box containing the sites of the path), not the length of the path itself. For example, if the path fills up an $m\times m$ box then the penalty for switching all the sites within the box from plus to minus is exponential in $m$ and not in $m^2$. To prove such a bound (with the appropriate exponent) you can still use the Peierls argument; for a (connected) set to be all minus, there must be some contour separating the set from the boundary. If the set is large, the contour must be long, and you can bound the probability of seeing such a long contour (decaying exponentially in the length). 

It converges to a strictly positive limit. Perhaps easiest to think about it in this way; assign every vertex an independent time which is uniform on $[0,1]$. If the vertices of $G_n$ are added in increasing order of their times, then this is equivalent to adding them one by one uniformly as you describe. But this way we can easily think about all the vertices in the infinite graph simultaneously. Now condition on the time of the root. Given that this time is $p$, the set of vertices preceding the root contains each other vertex independently with probability $p$. Call this the set of open vertices. Effectively this is percolation with a random probability $p$ (itself chosen uniformly on $[0,1]$). If we do percolation with probability $p$, then there exists an infinite open path starting from the root with positive probability iff $p>1/3$. This is almost the same as the probability of survival of a Galton-Watson branching process whose offspring distribution is Binomial($3,p$); the difference is that here the root has $4$ possible offspring, while each other vertex has only $3$. The probability (as a fuction of $p$) can be quite easily obtained as the solution of a recursive equation. To get the probability that the set of open vertices contains an infinite path from the root, integrate over $p$ from $1/3$ to $1$. The limit as $n\to\infty$ of the probability that the set of open vertices contains a path from the root to distance $n$ is then just this probability that the set of open vertices contains an infinite path from the root. 

I guess that the answer is no. The binary forms with discriminant $\Delta \cdot f^2$ describe ring class fields modulo $f$ (see Cox's book), so by taking the limit as $f \to \infty$ something like the idelic version of the full ring class group will result, and this is what I expect you will get using your weak equivalence. For proving that you cannot get anything beyond ring class fields you probably should look at G. Bruckner, Charakterisierung der galoisschen Zahlkörper, deren zerlegte Primzahlen durch binäre quadratische Formen gegeben sind, Math. Nachr. 32 (1966), 317-326, where the proof in the finite case is given. 

This makes a little bit more precise what has already been said in the comments. This list of emigrants (most of them were forced to leave since they lost their jobs; this applies to Emmy Noether, Richard Brauer, and later to Artin, who had a Jewish wife. Siegel, as far as I know, left because he couldn't stand the situation). One reason for founding the Mathematical Reviews, by the way, was the pressure on the Zentralblatt put up by German mathematicians (including Hasse) not to let emigrants review articles by Germans. French and Russian were widely used after World War II because these countries had excellent and very influential mathematicians at the time. 

How did Dirichlet express "this series by a definite integral" and derive the asymptotic expression for $g(t)$? Let me remark that Endres and Steiner (A new proof of the Voronoi summation formula) use Voronoi summation for proving the sharper estimate $$ g(t) \sim \frac1t \log \frac1t + \frac{\gamma}t + \frac14 + O(t) $$ as $t \to 0$. But this is not "easily found". How did Dirichlet transform his knowledge about the asymptotic behaviour of $\sum b_n e^{-nt}$ as $t \to 0$ into an average behaviour of $b_n$? This smells like a Tauberian result, but I'm not fluent enough in analytic number theory to see how easy this is. 

In absence of any evidence (she has collected works, and there are various people who have studied her biography) this is nonsense. In addition, this would not at all be compatible with Emmy Noether's character. 

As for 1, let $K/{\mathbb Q}$ be a finite abelian extension with Galois group $G$ and conductor $m$. Let $\sigma_a$ denote the restriction of the automorphism $\zeta_m \to \zeta_m^a$ of ${\mathbb Q}(\zeta_m)$ to $K$. Then $$ \theta(K) = \frac{1}{m} \sum a\sigma_a^{-1} \in {\mathbb Q}[G], $$ where the sum is over all $0 < a < m$ with $(a,m) = 1$, is called the Stickelberger element corresponding to $K$. The fact that $(b-\sigma_b)\theta \in {\mathbb Z}[G]$ for integers $b$ coprime to $m$ allows us to define the Stickelberger ideal $I_0(K)$ as the ideal in ${\mathbb Z}[G]$ generated by elements of the form $(b-\sigma_b)\theta$. Set $I(K) = {\mathbb Z}[G] \cap \theta {\mathbb Z}[G]$. If $K = {\mathbb Q}(\zeta_m)$ is a full cyclotomic field, then $I(K) = I_0(K)$. Stickelberger's Theorem says that if $K/{\mathbb Q}$ is an abelian extension, then the Stickelberger ideal $I(K)$ annihilates the class group $Cl(K)$. Applied to quadratic extensions, you get the theorem first proved by Cauchy and Jacobi mentioned above. See my Reciprocity Laws, Chapter 11, for details. 

It seems that the first published proof of the result in the title is due to the Banu Musa, two brothers from Baghdad living in the 9th century. In their book on The measurement of plane and solid figures composed around 850, Section V has the title "The ratio of the diameter of any circle to its circumference is one (that is, the same for all circles". The corresponding extract is available in Pi: A source book by Berggren, Borwein & Borwein. See also p. 450 in Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science vol 2, by R. Rashid, and R. Morelon (available on google books). 

Fermat did not prove this result; he claimed that the only solution is the obvious one and conjectured (in words that seem to suggest he knew how to prove it, but without explicitly saying so) that this can be proved by descent. I am sure that Fermat, if he really believed to have a proof (in my opinion he did not), was mistaken. I am not aware of any proofs based on Fermat's techniques alone, and I have often tried to find one myself - so far without success.
