I recommend that you read the first few sections of Ribet's article in Inventiones 100 (the one in which he proves that modularity of elliptic curves implies FLT). In these three or four sections he summarizes a large number of the results from SGA VII, in so far as they apply to the case of curves with semistable reduction. 

Let $G$ be the group of norm one elements in $D^{\times}$. An easy argument shows that it suffices to prove the claim for $G$ in place of $D^{\times}$. In other words, I will let $\pi$ be an automorphic rep. of $G$. Now suppose that $\pi_{\infty}$ is one-dimensional. This means that in fact $\pi_{\infty}$ is trivial (because $G(\mathbb Q_v) = SL_2(\mathbb R)$ has no non-trivial characters). Now we use the fact that the automorphic representation lives inside the space of automorphic forms on $G(\mathbb Q)\backslash G(\mathbb A).$ Thus $\pi$ is a space of functions $f(g)$ on $G(\mathbb A)$ such that $f(\gamma g u) = f(g)$ for any $\gamma \in G(\mathbb Q)$ and $u \in U$, a compact open subgroup of $G(\mathbb A^{\infty})$ (with $U$ depending on $f$). Our assumption on $\pi$ shows that furthermore $g_{\infty}f = f$ for all $g_{\infty} \in G(\mathbb R)$. Thus if $\gamma \in G(\mathbb Q)$, $g \in G(\mathbb A)$, $g_{\infty} \in G(\mathbb R)$, and $u \in U$, then $$f(\gamma g ug_{\infty}) = (g_{\infty} f)(\gamma g u) = f(\gamma g u) = f(g).$$ Now strong approximation says that the double coset space $G(\mathbb Q)\backslash G(\mathbb A)/ U G(\mathbb R)$ is a point, and combined with the above calculation, this shows that $f$ is constant, and thus generates the trivial representation under the action of $G(\mathbb A)$. Since $f$ was an arbitrary element of $\pi,$ we see that $\pi$ is trivial, i.e. that all $\pi_v$ are one-dimesional. 

Dear Igor, Just to add some context to the answers that you have received: what you are considering is (a local version of) the following geometric situation: a map $X \to Y,$ where $Y$ is smooth, $X$ is normal, and the fibres are finite. Now by Noether normalization (which is just an algebraic way of describing projection to a hyperplane) any variety can be made finite over a smooth one, and in particular, this is true of any normal variety. Thus your question is (essentially) ``is every normal variety smooth?'', to which the answer is no as soon as the dimension is $> 1$. This is where Angelo's answer comes from: he wrote down the simplest isolated singularity on a surface in 3-space (the vertex of a cone), and this singularity is normal but singular. (Normal implies that the singularities are in codimension 2, and for a hypersurface in an affine or projective space, the converse holds.) To have a positive answer in some situation, you need to control the branching of your finite map in some way (it is along the branch locus that singularities can appear), and the references that BCnrd mentions deal with this kind of question. One more remark, which you probably know (but just to be sure): if $A$ is a DVR (i.e. if you are in the one dimensional case), then $B$ will be regular (assuming some reasonable background hypotheses, so that $B$ is finite over $A$, for example); geometrically, for a curve, being normal is the same as being smooth. 

You should distinguish between the method (of which there is not one, but several) and the result (namely, the existence of $p$-adic $L$-functions). It is expected that $p$-adic $L$-function exist in great generality (say for algebraic automorphic representations, i.e. automorphic representations that are expected to have a connection with Galois representations). But they have not yet been constructed in that level of generality. For Grossencharacters of totally real fields, they were constructed by Serre, and studied further by Deligne and Ribet, and others. For Grossencharacters on CM fields, they were constructed by Katz. They are also constructed for anticyclotomic twists of (base-changes to a quad. imag. field) of classical modular forms, and I think for symmetric squares of classical modular forms. I have omitted many other cases that are known, and I'm not going to attempt to make additional attributions, since I'll likely get them wrong. In general, the construction and study of $p$-adic $L$-functions is an active and ongoing research area. Just to give one idea of the current state of play, let me mention that there is an ongoing project of Eischen, Harris, Li, Skinner and myself which will construct them for twists of certain conjugate self-dual cuspforms on $GL_n$ over a CM field. (This generalizes Katz's result, which is the $n = 1$ case, and the anti-cyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions for modular forms, which is the $n = 2$ case.) In this construction, as in many of the other constructions mentioned above, there will be technical restrictions and caveats; I won't try to describe them here. 

One more remark: trading in a $U_p$-action for a $GL_2(\mathbb Q_p)$-action is a fairly significant upgrading of structure, and this is why completed cohomology provides a useful tool for proving modularity theorems for Galois representations, over and above the already-existing theories of $p$-adic modular forms and $p$-adic modular symbols. 

Following Theo Johnson--Freyd's suggestion, I am making my above comment an answer: Just subtracting one series from the other, it seems that you need $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (f(n)−g(n))$ to converge. Writing $$f(n)/g(n)=1+\delta_n,$$ $$\text{so that } \qquad \qquad\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (f(n)−g(n))=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \delta_n g(n),$$ you see need control over the signs of the $\delta_n$, or (as Theo notes in his comment, on their rate of growth). E.g. if they are all of the same sign, you are okay, while if the sign of $\delta_n$ is always the same as, or always opposite to, that of $\delta_n$, then you could be in bad shape. (This is what goes wrong in Xandi Tuni's example.) As Theo notes in his comment, you are also okay if $\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \delta_n$ converges absolutely. Whether this applies in your case will depend on how closely $f$ and $g$ approximate one another. (This is illustrated by the example in Julian Aguirre's answer.) 

If $G$ is a connected, linear, reductive group over $\mathbb Q$, let $q_0$ be the dimension so denoted in Borel--Wallach, i.e. $q_0 = (d - l_0)/2,$ where $d = \text{dim } G_{\infty} - \text{ dim } A_{\infty}K_{\infty}$ and $l_0 = \text{rank } G_{\infty} - \text{ rank } A_{\infty}K_{\infty},$ where $G_{\infty} = G(\mathbb R)$, $K_{\infty}$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G_{\infty}$, and $A_{\infty} = A(\mathbb R)$ with $A$ being the maximal $\mathbb Q$-split torus in the centre of $G$. (So $q_0$ is the first interesting dimension of homology in the locally symmetric arithmetic quotients attached to $G$.) Then the inductive limit of the cohomology groups $H^{q_0}(G(\mathbb Q)\backslash G(\mathbb A)/A_{\infty}K_{\infty}K_f,\mathbb F_{\ell})$, as $K_f$ runs over all compact open subgroups of $G(\mathbb A_f)$, is an admissible smooth representation of $G(\mathbb G_f)$, which is (I believe) a reasonable substitute for a space of mod $\ell$ automorphic forms. In the case when $G$ satifies the conditions of Gross's "Algebraic modular forms" paper, $q_0 = 0$, the locally symmetric quotients are just finite sets, and this is precisely the space of mod $\ell$ algebraic modular forms. This doesn't deal with Kevin's problems; this space will (conjecturally) only contain automorphic forms whose systems of Hecke eigenvalues correspond to odd Galois representations. Nevertheless, it is a space, and one can (and does) try to work with it. 

Marty's answer discusses the Plancherel formula, and in a comment on his answer, I mentioned Harish-Chandra's work on the Plancherel formula in the case of reductive Lie groups. Yemon Choi's answer also mentions the case of semisimple Lie groups as being easier than the general case. The point of this answer is to elaborate slightly on my comment, and to point out that, while the semi-simple case might be easier, it is a very substantial piece of mathematics; indeed, it is essentially Harish-Chandra's life's work. When Harish-Chandra began his work, it was known (thanks to Mautner?) that semisimple Lie groups were type I, and hence that for such a group $G$, the space $L^2(G)$ admits a well-defined direct integral decomposition into irreducibles (typically infinite dimensional, if $G$ is not compact). However, this is a far cry from knowing the precise form of the decomposition. The most fundamental, and difficult, question, turns out to be whether there are any atoms in the Plancherel measure, i.e. whether $L^2(G)$ contains any non-zero irreducible subspaces, i.e. whether the group $G$ admits discrete series. This was solved by Harish-Chandra, who established his famous criterion: $G$ admits discrete series if and only if it contains a compact Cartan subgroup. He also gave a complete enumeration of the discrete series representations up to isomorphism, and described their characters via formulas analogous to the Weyl character formula. Harish-Chandra then want on to describe the Plancherel measure on $L^2(G)$ inductively in terms of direct integrals of parabolic inductions of discrete series represenations of Levi subgroups of $G$. (It is the appearance of Levi subgroups, which are always reductive but typically never semisimple, that also forces one to generalize from the semisimple to the reductive case.) After completing the theory of the Plancherel measure for reductive Lie groups, he then went on to develop the analogous theory for $p$-adic reductive groups. However, in this case, one still doesn't have a complete enumeration of the discrete series representations in general: there are certain "atomic" discrete series representations, called "supercuspidal", which have no analog for Lie groups, and which aren't yet classified in general (i.e. for all $p$-adic reductive groups). Harish-Chandra's work, as well as standing on its own as an amazing edifice, was a central inspiration for Langlands in his development of the Langlands program, and remains at the core of the Langlands proram today. For a very nice introduction to Harish-Chandra's work, and the surrounding circle of ideas, one can read this article by Rebecca Herb. 

The parity conjecture is known, i.e. it is known that if the order of vanishing of the $L$-function is even/odd, then the corank of $p$-Selmer is of the same parity (and I think this is known for every $p$ at this point; Nekovar handled the good ordinary or multiplicative case, and B.D. Kim the good supersingular case. T. and V. Dokchitser then gave a new proof that handled the general case). This would imply that if Sha(E) is finite (even after passing to the $p$-part of Sha for some prime $p$) and the $L$-function has odd order vanishing, then $E({\mathbb Q})$ has positive rank. There has also been recent work on establishing cases of positive even order vanishing, and trying to prove that the Selmer group has rank at least two. This has been investigated by both Bellaiche--Chenevier and Skinner--Urban. I don't know precise statements though, and I'm not sure if either pair of authors can handle elliptic curves. (In both cases, the arguments involve deforming along an eigenvariety, and there are problems at low weights. So they may only have results for modular forms of weight $k > 2$.) Incidentally, although it wasn't part of your question, I don't think anything new is known about finiteness of Sha, beyond what you recalled in your question. 

I don't think that the example you chose is the simplest one. It might be better to start with say a vector bundle $\mathcal V \to X$ over some base space $X$. Suppose now that $G$ acts on $X$. A $G$-equivariant structure on $\mathcal V$ is a choice of $G$-action on $\mathcal V$ (assuming it exists) preserving the vector bundle structure and compatible with the given $G$-action on $X$. E.g. if $G$ acts on a space $X$, and $\mathcal V$ is functorially assigned to $X$, e.g. the tangent bundle or cotangent bundle, then $\mathcal V$ will have a natural $G$-equivariant structure. Another example: if $X$ is $n$-dimensional projective space, with its usual action of $GL_{n+1}$ (which factors through $PGL_{n+1}$) and $\mathcal V$ is the tautological line bundle, then $X$ is naturally $GL_{n+1}$-equivariant. To see this, note that (if we remove the zero section) then the tautological line bundle over $\mathbb P^n$ is just ${\mathbb C}^{n+1}\setminus \{0\} \to ({\mathbb C}^{n+1}\setminus \{0\} )/ {\mathbb C}^{\times}\cong {\mathbb P}^n$, and $GL_{n+1}$-acts compatibly on the members of this diagram. 

Suppose that we have an ideal $I$ of ${\mathcal C}(k)$ that is not contained in any one of the $\mathfrak m\_n.$ Then for each $n$, the ideal $I$ contains an element $(k_i)$ with $k_n \neq 0.$ Multiplying by the element $k_n^{-1} \underline{e}_n$, where $\underline{e}_n$ denotes the element which is $0$ in every coordinate except $n$, we find that $\underline{e}_n \in I$ for every $n$. Thus $I$ contains $\mathfrak c$. In particular, if $I$ is maximal, then it coincides with $\mathfrak m_0$ (by your characterization of $\mathfrak m_0$ as the unique maximal ieal containing $\mathfrak p$). So, barring a blunder, this seems to show that the maximal ideals of $\mathcal C(k)$ are precisely the $\mathfrak m_n$ and $\mathfrak m_0$. The quotient $\mathcal C(k)/\mathfrak c$ is a local ring (by the uniquess of $\mathfrak m_0$), but I don't see anything else to say about it yet. 

Not necessarily. For example if $n = 2$, then $SO(1)$ is the trivial group, and so if $\pi$ is infinite dimensional, it is the trivial representation of $SO(1)$ with infinite multiplicity. Now suppose $n = 3$. The trivial representation of $SO(2)$ occurs with mult. one in every irrep. of $SO(3)$. So if $\pi$ is infinite dimensional, and so contains an infinite number of irreps. of $SO(3)$, then $\pi$ will contain the trivial representation of $SO(2)$ with infinite multiplicity.
