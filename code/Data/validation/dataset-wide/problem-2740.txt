It's a long, critical paper but its criticisms are worth consideration. You should be able to tell from the Abstract whether the paper is likely to be of help regarding your particular concerns. 

In the Jewish Enlightenment - the Jewish contribution to the Enlightenment - Moses Mendelssohn (1729-86) was widely referred to as 'the German Socrates'. We might note that Mendelssohn found enough interest and illumination in Homer and Aesop to write essays on them. ▻ PLATO AND ARISTOTLE Plato seems not to have been a central influence except as a conduit through his dialogues of (what were taken to be) Socrates' ideas. Aristotle's reputation was under a cloud because of the rejection of Aristotelianism in the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, a revolution which the Enlightenment celebrated. ▻ LUCRETIUS A Roman, of course, but the Latin voice of the Greek philosopher, Epicurus. Lucretius's 'De Rerum Natura' [On the Nature of Things] was an Enlightenment favourite because, in place of Christian assurances about a problematic life after death, and the grip of age-old fear of death, it denied that death was an evil. Everything should be focused on 'this' life : our pre-natal non-existence was nothing to us before we were born and equally our post mortem non-existence will be nothing to us after our death. When we are alive, we have the experience of being alive; when we are dead we will have no experience of being dead. (I think the argument is flawed but that doesn't matter here.) ▻ SENECA Another Roman but also an exponent of Greek Stoicism and hence a conduit through which Greek philosophy penetrated the Enlightenment. Let D'Alembert, as important an Enlightenment figure as Voltaire and Diderot, speak for himself : 'In philosophy logic should be limited to a few lines; metaphysics to an abridgement of Locke, purely philosophical ethics to the work of Seneca' (Peter Gay, 'The Enlightenment : An Interpretation', NY : W.W. Norton, 1977, p.510.) REFERENCES Goulbourne, Russell. 2007. 'Voltaire's Socrates'. In Trapp, 'Socrates from Antiquity to the Enlightenment', 229-47. Trapp, Michael. 2007.

1 'Why ?' questions do occur in philosophy. 'Why should there be something rather than nothing ?' This obviously you concede and it motivates your question. One way in which we could build a philosophy only on 'How ?' questions would be if we had the syntactic or other apparatus to convert - reduce - every 'Why ?' question to a 'How ?' question. I can't see that 'Why ?' questions are irreducible in principle to 'How ?' questions but I don't have or know of a reductionist theory by which to do this. You might try your hand btw at reducing ''Why should there be something rather than nothing ?' to a 'How ?' question. Or perhaps you would decline the task because you do not regard 'Why ?' questions as being in good order; you plainly don't like that they involve 'extrinsic reasons'. Does this rule them out of court ? 2 A wide range of philosophical questions are straightforwwardly 'How ?' questions already : a. How can we have free will in a deterministic universe ? b. How can there be causal relations between Descartes' two substances, mind and matter, when mind is thinking and unextended and matter is extended and unthinking ? c. How can there be evil in a world created by an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly beneficent God ? d. How can we have necessary a posteriori knowledge ? e. How can know whether memory is reliable ? Don't put the questions at my door ! They're culled from the literature. I might add the great Kantian question, 'How is knowledge possible ?' But a mere list doesn't show or suggest that any 'How ?' list could exhaust the whole range of philosophical questions, present and future. For that we need to go back to 1 and the need for the details or at least the outline of a reductionist method of redefining 'Why ?' questions as 'How ?' questions. Fascinating question ! 

▻ AVERAGE AND TOTAL DO NOT NECESSARILY DIFFER There is no necessary difference of result between the two criteria. Take a single society with a population of 100. The greatest total utility for this society (at a time) is 1000 utils, let's say. That's the absolute limit, the maximum total utility possible. The average utility will be 10. The average utility cannot be higher since maximum utility has been reached at 1000 - nor can it be lower. 1000 divided by 100 gives an average of 10 whatever the case. ▻ WHEN THEY DIFFER, WHAT IS THE CASE FOR PREFERRING AVERAGE TO TOTAL UTILITY? But if you take two societies, even if they are egalitarian and each member gains the same amount of utility, it is rational to choose the society which has the highest average utility. How so? Suppose Society A has a total utility of 10,000 and 5000 members; and Society B has a total utility of 5000 and 100 members. In society A, total utility is higher but average utility is 2 utils. In Society B, total utility is lower but average utility is higher at 50 utils. My rational choice would be to go by average utility. As a rational agent, all else equal, I'd rather have 50 utils than 2. ▻ IS THERE NO CASE FOR PREFERRING TOTAL UTILITY ? There is a case, especially as concerns future generations. You need to go into specialist literature here. But one argument, relating to future generations, is sketched as follows : 

So the quick answer to the paradox is that we have knowledge, not by gaining it but by recollecting it. Though the theory of Forms is not explicitly present in the Meno there seems to be an assumption that the boy has in a previous existence had acquaintance with the relevant geometrical Forms and this acquaintance is gradually renewed under the promptings of diagrams and questions and answers. It is a moot point whether Socrates really does not impart information through his questions but one's immediate impression is that the theory of recollection is total fantasy. Yet it marks the site of a significant problem. If, as seems likely, the boy inferred the truth of the theorem and didn't 'recollect' it at all, must he not have had innate resources that enabled him to make the right inferences ? The current possibility here is nativism, the notion that people have some innate ideas. Mental functions and capacities, perhaps even knowledge of universal grammar, do not appear to be learned. Kant attributed certain categories as intrinsic to the human mind - brought to experience and not derived from it. Could the same be true of certain mental functions and capacities ? Evolutionary psychology, along with common sense, gives credibility to at least some form(s) of nativism. It appears to answer, or to be en route to answer, how we can have knowledge without gaining it. 

1 The fallacy of appeal to authority - argumentum ad verecundiam - is involved here. It is an informal or material fallacy, not one of formal logic. The manufacturers of EatIt are appealing to the (supposed) veracity of accredited experts, scientists, to validate their product - to give consumers reliable reassurance (they pretend) that their product is safe. They have not provided any actual evidence - e.g. detailed reports of randomised control trials, the gold standard of clinical trials. 2 There is also the fallacy of secundum quid where you say something that is true under a qualification but omit to state or imply the qualification. 'Scientists have given EatIt their seal of approval' commits this fallacy because only some scientists (we assume they really are scientists) have given EatIt their seal of approval, not all. So I reckon your manufacturers have committed two informal fallacies. 

MACHIAVELLI AND THE DIVERSITY OF POLITICS Note that Machiavelli does not address his question to politics in a crude or blank way. He weaves it through a variety of situations. His answer, he thinks, namely that it is better to be feared than loved, applies to republics as well as to princedoms and to conditions both of stability and of renovation.

There is actually a fair amount of material. My first three thoughts are : (1) that it is not profitable to consider whether corporations are metaphysical persons. There is no firm, clear, consensual answer to the question : 'What is a person ?' Referring, that is, to the sort of entity you and I are. Since we are unclear about this basic, metaphysical concept of a person, we are unlikely to make much progress on whether corporations are persons too. (2) Corporations might be 'moral persons' in the sense that they can possess rights, privileges, duties. (3) They might also be 'moral agents' in the sense that they are morally accountable, responsible, capable of causing blameworthy harm and subject to punishment. Some references might be of better help (though I've listed Scruton and Finnis last they offer a good discussion which you needn't read first but would be well-advised to include in your early reading - Scruton is a philosopher who is also a qualified lawyer and Finnis is a qualified lawyer who is also a philosopher) : 1 Rita C.
