I am going to write a community wiki answer here which people can vote up. (See this meta thread concerning the Mathoverflow user, which bumps questions with no voted-up answer.) Main result: A homomorphism $f: \mathbb Z \to GL_n(\mathbb Q_p)$ extends continuously to $\hat{\mathbb Z}$ if and only if the image of $f$ can be conjugated into $GL_n(\mathbb Z_p)$. Proof: If $f:\hat{\mathbb Z} \to GL_n(\mathbb Q_p)$ is continuous, the image is compact, hence contained in a maximal compact subgroup, which can be conjugated into $GL_n(\mathbb Z_p)$. Conversely, if $f:\mathbb Z \to GL_n(\mathbb Q_p)$ lands in a compact subgroup, then the closure of the image is compact, hence profinite (any compact subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb Q_p)$ is profinite), and hence $f$ extends to $\hat{\mathbb Z}$ (since $\hat{\mathbb Z}$ is precisely the profinite completion of $\mathbb Z$). QED As noted in the comments, to tell if a matrix (e.g. $f(1)$) can be conjugated into $GL_n(\mathbb Z_p)$, one simply has to look at the characteristic polynomial, and ask that all the coefficients lie in $\mathbb Z_p$, with the constant term being a unit. Thus to apply the theorem in practice, one simply computes the characteristic polynomial of $f(1)$ and see if its satisfies these conditions. EDIT: Now actually made community wiki; sorry about that --- I thought I had already clicked the CW box, but obviously not. (The point is that the above argument is just a rephrasing of what is in the comments.) 

It might be worth noting that the problems of computing Feynmann integrals in quantum field theory is one that is traditionally phrased as one of analysis, but is now studied by pure mathematicians using categorical techniques (among others). 

No, it's not true in general. E.g. the pricipal ideal generated by $px - 1$ is maximal in $\mathbb Z_p[x]$ (for any prime $p$); the quotient $\mathbb Z_p[x]/(p x - 1)$ is precisely the field $\mathbb Q_p$. However, the intersection of this ideal with $\mathbb Z_p$ is equal to the zero ideal, which is not maximal. If the ring $A$ is Jacobson, then the result you want is true. (For in this case, if $\mathfrak m$ is a maximal ideal in $A[x]$, then $A[x]/\mathfrak m$ is a finite type $A$-algebra which is a field, therefore is finite over $A$ by the Jacobson hypothesis, and so the image of $A$ in $A[x]/\mathfrak m$ (which is equal to $A/A\cap \mathfrak m$) is itself a field, and so $A\cap \mathfrak m$ is maximal in $A$.) 

Many (most? all?) North American graduate programs have some form of qualifying exam (which goes by different names at different institutions) whose goal is to establish a baseline knowledge of the kind that you ask about. Typical topics are algebra and real and complex analysis. However, there is no law (natural or human) saying that a person will remember what they have once been taught, and if one's goal (in a colloquium, or equivalently, any lecture to non-sepcialists) is to be understood, it will not be any use to appeal to some alleged common knowledge specified in a document, or a qualifying exam syllabus, or anywhere else. I think a more realistic solution is to develop mechanisms for explaining ideas which appeal to a wide range of audience members, and include many different ways for them to try and understand what you are talking about. This is never easy, unforutnately, but it can become easier with practice. I think one thing to remember is that simple geometric ideas are often easier to communicate than algebraic ones, and are (in my experience) more likely to appeal to a wide range of audience members. Also, I think one should be especially receptive to the idea that audience members will be confused by your notation, and thus one should adopt simple notation and be prepared to explain it. (So my sympathies are with you in your attempt to divine the meaning of $\hat{f}(t)$!) [Added in response to edit to question:] The best way to improve the average level of talks is, I think, to train graduate students to give good talks. In general, the mathematical community is sensitive to the quality of talks: e.g. job candidates can fail an interview because of a badly delivered job talk; an important criterion for plenary speakers at AMS events is that they can give good talks; colloquium speakers are typically selected in part on the basis of their ability to give good talks. So the ability to give good general audience talks is an important professional skill, and we should do our best to teach it (along with all the other important professional skills that we teach to our graduate students). 

Dear roger123, This is largely a response to your question aksed as a comment below Charles Siegel's answer, but it won't fit in the comment box. Since $\mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}$ is a sheaf of modules over the sheaf of rings $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n}$ (the structure sheaf of projective space), its global sections $\mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}(\mathbb P^n)$ are a module over the ring $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n}(\mathbb P^n)$, which in turn are just $k$ (the ground field). In short, the global sections of $\mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}$ form a $k$-vector space. Maybe you are being confused by the fact that $\mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}$ is a sheaf on $\mathbb P^n$ that is supported on $X$, so that people often simultaneously regard it as a sheaf on either $X$ or $\mathbb P^n$. This is okay, because if $U$ is any open in $\mathbb P^n$ and $\mathcal F$ is a sheaf supported on $X$, then the sections over an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb P^n$ (when it is regarded as a sheaf on $\mathbb P^n$) will coincide with the sections over $U\cap X$ (when it is regarded as a sheaf on $X$). In particular, one has the equation $\mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}(X) = \mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}(\mathbb P^n)$ (an abuse of notation if taken literally; however one is supposed to regard $\mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}$ as a sheaf on $X$ on the left-hand side, and as a sheaf on $\mathbb P^n$ on the right-hand side). One more thing: If the residue field of the Hilbert scheme at the point $P$ is $k(P)$, then $P$ is a $k(P)$-valued point of the Hilbert scheme, and so the corresponding closed subscheme $X$ lies in $\mathbb P^n_{k(P)}$. Thus, in the above discussion, $k$ can (and should) be taken to be $k(P)$. Thus the above discussion explains why $\mathcal N_{\mathbb P^n/X}(X)$ is a $k(P)$-vector space, as it should be. 

If one is doing smooth representations of the $p$-adic group $G$ on complex vector spaces, then the action is locally constant (small open subgroups act trivially on vectors), and so any interpretation of what it means to differentiate the action will give you the trivial action. (Note also the the Lie algebra has $p$-adic coefficients, while the representation $V$ has complex coefficients, so there is not much scope for a non-trivial action!). On the other hand, if you mean not-necessarily-smooth actions of $G$ on a $p$-adic vector space, as one has in the theory developed by Schneider and Teitelbaum that is related to the $p$-adic Langlands program, then one can and does differentiate the action (provided it is locally analytic), and one does obtain interesting Lie algebra actions. 

Dear Victor, I believe it was Shimura in the paper On elliptic curves with complex multiplication as factors of the Jacobians of modular function fields, Nagoya Math. J. 43 (1971), 199â€“208. Regards, Matthew 

Regarding (1), from the point of view of Galois representations, the point is that continuous Weil group representations on a complex vector space, by their nature, have finite image on inertia. On the other hand, while a continuous $\ell$-adic Galois representation of $G_{\mathbb Q_p}$ (with $\ell \neq p$ of course) must have finite image on wild inertia, it can have infinite image on tame inertia. The formalism of Weil--Deligne representations extracts out this possibly infinite image, and encodes it as a nilpotent operator (something that is algebraic, and doesn't refer to the $\ell$-adic topology, and hence has a chance to be independent of $\ell$). As for (2): Representations of the Weil group are essentially the same thing as representations of $G_{\mathbb Q}$ which, when restricted to some open subgroup, become abelian. Thus (as one example) if $E$ is an elliptic curve over $\mathbb Q$ that is not CM, its $\ell$-adic Tate module cannot be explained by a representation of the Weil group (or any simple modification thereof). Thus neither can the weight 2 modular form to which it corresponds. In summary: the difference between the global and local situations is that an $\ell$-adic representation of $G_{\mathbb Q_p}$ (or of $G_E$ for any $p$-adic local field) becomes, after a finite base-change to kill off the action of wild inertia, a tamely ramified representation, which can then be described by two matrices, the image of a lift of Frobenius and the image of a generator of tame inertia, satisfying a simple commutation relation. On the other hand, global Galois representations arising from $\ell$-adic cohomology of varieties over number fields are much more profoundly non-abelian. Added: Let me also address the question about a product of $W_{F_v}'$. Again, it is simplest to think in terms of Galois representations (which roughly correspond to motives, which, one hopes, roughly correspond to automorphic forms). So one can reinterpret the question as asking: is giving a representation of $G_F$ (for a number field $F$) the same as giving representations of each $G_{F_v}$ (as $v$ ranges over the places of $F$). Certainly, by Cebotarev, the restriction of the global representation to the local Galois groups will determine it; but it will overdetermine it; so giving a collection of local representations, it is unlikely that they will combine into a global one. ($G_F$ is very far from being the free product of the $G_{F_v}$, as Cebotarev shows.) To say something on the automorphic side, imagine writing down a random degree 2 Euler product. You can match this with a formal $q$-expansion, which will be a Hecke eigenform, by taking Mellin transforms, and with a representation of $GL_2(\mathbb A_F)$, by writing down a corresponding tensor product of unramified representations of the various $G_{F_v}$. But what chance is there that this object is an automorphic representation? What chance is there that your random formal Hecke eigenform is actually a modular form? What chance is there that your random Euler product is actually an automorphic $L$-function? Basically none. You have left out some vital global glue, the same glue which describes the interrelations of all the $G_{F_v}$ inside $G_F$. Teasing out the nature of this glue is at the heart of proving the conjectured relationship between automorphic forms and motives; its mysterious nature is what makes the theories of automorphic forms, and of Galois representations, so challenging. 

Added: You asked about motivation. The original motivation for defining completed cohomology was to construct eigenvarieties. Later it became clear that it was an important object in its own right, providing a global counterpart to the representations of $p$-adic groups that were beginning to appear as part of $p$-adic local Langlands. E.g. the theorem that locally algebraic vectors in cohomology are classical was first proved as an ingredient in the proof of an analogue of Coleman's "small slope implies classical" result for the eigenvariety constructed from completed cohomology. Only later was it realized that this could be combined with a local-global compatiblity result to prove modularity theorems for Galois representations. Note that the rough relation with $p$-adic modular forms, namely that one gets the same Hecke algebra via either approach, was clear from the beginning, even though the more precise Eichler--Shimura-like statement above was not. Since eigenvarieties (as their name indicates) only care about Hecke eigenvalues, this meant that completed cohomology was good enough for constructing them. 

A remark on the (lack of) $p$-adic valued Haar measure: there can exist topologically irreducible continuous representations of pro-$p$ groups (e.g. $GL_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ on infinite-dimensional $p$-adic Banach spaces. This is pretty strong evidence that there is no simple analogue of Haar measure in the $p$-adic situation. (Remember that the existence of Haar measure means that this is impossible for representations of compact groups on real or complex spaces: topologically irreducible representations are necessarily finite-dimensional.) Another remark, on semi-simplicity: It is conjectured that the representations of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ of $K$ occuring on the $p$-adic etale cohomology of a smooth proper variety over a number field $K$ is semi-simple. (This is a part of the so-called Tate conjecture.) As far as I know, this is very wide open other than in the abelian variety case (and hence in the case of $H^1$ in general, since $H^1$ can always be thought of as the $H^1$ of the Albanese). As far as I know, there is no general representation-theoretic argument of the type you envisage which would prove it; it is something deep and special about the particular representations appearing in etale cohomology. 

Consider the exact sequence $0 \to \mathfrak m \to R \to k \to 0.$ Tensoring with $k$ gives $0 \to \mathfrak m/\mathfrak m^2 \to k = k \to 0.$ Thus if $k$ is flat over $R$, then $\mathfrak m = \mathfrak m^2$. If furthermore $R$ is Noetherian, this implies that $\mathfrak m = 0$, and hence that $R = k$. Conclusion: For Noetherian $R$, the desired flatness hold only if $R = k$. Added: A colleague points out that flat local maps of local rings are always faithfully flat, hence injective. Thus even in the non-Noetherian case, the only way for $k$ to be flat over $R$ is if $R = k$. In fact, one can directly extend the above argument to the not-necessarily-Noetherian case, as follows: Let $I$ be any finitely generated ideal contained in $\mathfrak m$. Since $k$ is flat, $k\otimes_R I \hookrightarrow k\otimes_R \mathfrak m,$ the target of which vanishes, as noted above. Thus $k\otimes _R I$ vanishes, and so by Nakayama's lemma, $I = 0$. Since $\mathfrak m$ is the union of such $I$, we see that $\mathfrak m = 0$, and thus $R = k$. 

Yes. The ring ${\mathbb Z}/n {\mathbb Z}$ is injective over itself, and over a Noetherian ring, direct limits of injectives are again injective; thus ${\mathbb Z}/n{\mathbb Z}^{(I)}$ is injective over ${\mathbb Z}/n{\mathbb Z}$. Finally, any embedding of an injective splits, as follows directly from the property of being injective. We can now apply this to the embedding $({\mathbb Z}/n{\mathbb Z})^{(I)} \hookrightarrow ({\mathbb Z}/n{\mathbb Z})^I.$ 

Various groups of people have thought about/are thinking about this. The natural source of the desired Galois reps. is a $U(2,2)$ Shimura variety. The problem is that the cohomology of this variety is not so easy to understand. The fundamental lemma certainly plays some role in controlling it, but I don't think that by itself it overcomes the key difficulties. (My own understanding of the issues is far from perfect, though.) 

It might also be helpful to know that projective is equivalent to being a summand of a free module (apply $Hom(M,\text{--})$ to a presentation of $M$), and hence projectives are flat. The converse is not true in general (e.g. $\mathbb Q$ is flat as a $\mathbb Z$-module, but not projective), but for finitely presented modules over commutative rings, flat and projective are equivalent. 

Frequently in arguments in algebraic number theory, one has to choose a prime that satisfies some list of conditions, and is bigger than some given bound. (A simple example of the kind of condition that I am thinking of would be that the prime should lie in a given congruence class modulo some number $n$.) One then interprets the conditions in such a way as to be able to apply the Cebotarev density theorem to conclude that there are infinitely many primes satisfying the given conditions, and so in particular a suitable prime can be found that lies above the desired bound. (In the simple example, one would use Dirichlet's theorem on the existence of infinitely many primes in arithmetic progression, which from this point of view is a special case of Cebotarev density.) 

I would guess that Grothendieck's envisaged proof, via the standard conjectures, would be "morally right" in Kontsevich's sense. (Although there is the question of how the standard conjectures would be proved; since they remain conjectures, this question is open for now!) The objection to Deligne's proof is that it relies on various techniques (passing to symmetric powers and Rankin--Selberg inspired ideas, analytic arguments related to the positivity of the coefficients of the zeta-function, and other such things) that don't seem to be naturally related to the question at hand. I believe that Grothendieck had a similar objection to Deligne's argment. As a number-theorist, I think Deligne's proof is fantastic. One of the appeals (at least to me) of number theory is that none of the proofs are "morally right" in Kontsevich's sense. Obviously, this is a very personal feeling. (Of course, a proof of the standard conjectures --- any proof, to my mind --- would also be fantastic!) [Edit, for clarification; this is purely an aside, though:] Some arguments in number theory, for example the primitive root theorem discussed in the comments, are pure algebra when viewed appropriately, and here there are very natural and direct arguments. (For example, in the case of primitive roots, there is basic field theory combined with Hensel's lemma/Newton approximation; this style of argument extends, in some form, to the very general setting of complete local rings.) When I wrote that none of the proof in number theory are "morally right", I had in mind largely the proofs in modern algebraic number theory, such as the modularity of elliptic curves, Serre's conjecture, Sato--Tate, and so on. The proofs use (almost) everything under the sun, and follow no dogma. Tate wrote of abelian class field theory that "it is true because it could not be otherwise" (if I remember the quote correctly), which I took to mean (given the context) that the proofs in the end are unenlightening as to the real reason it is true; they are simply logically correct proofs. This seems to be even more the case with the proofs of results in non-abelian class field theory such as those mentioned above. Despite this, I personally find the arguments wonderful; it is one of the appeals of the subject for me.
