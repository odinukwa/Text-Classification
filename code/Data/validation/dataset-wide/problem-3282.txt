If we talk about those small castles on hilltops which (or their ruins) can be found all over mainland Europe, it's important to first understand what their purpose was. We are not talking about early medieval castles which were just protecting the property of a single family, but military installations of late medieval to early modern Europe. So, what purpose did such small castles (most of which couldn't hold more than a few hundred defenders) have in the face of an army of tens of thousands? They are obviously not the goal of a campaign, they are not the fortified cities which would be valuable for the attacker. What does the attacker want? They want to besiege an important city or the capital, or force a decisive battle with their opponents so they can sue for an advantageous peace. They arrive to a tiny little fortress which sits on a hilltop. What would you do? 

The US military uses a scale of alert readiness called DEFCON, with DEFCON 5 being the lowest alert level and DEFCON 1 being the highest, preparing for imminent nuclear war. At least once during the Cold War, readiness was pushed all the way to DEFCON 2. When DEFCON levels were raised, how secret was this? Did the Soviet Union know when DEFCON levels changed? 

Do we still know what beehives looked like in ancient Mesopotamia? Are there any contemporary images or descriptions? I'm looking for anything from before 500 BC. I've found an image of ancient Egyptian beehives, though it's hard to tell much about them from the picture. (Article on beekeeping in ancient Egypt) 

Sure, it's possible. Many things are possible. Likely, however, is another question. The link you posted describes a vague story of sailing west into the Atlantic, finding an island, trading with the locals, and returning home. Could the island be in the New World? It could, but it could just as easily be one of the islands in the Atlantic. For me to consider the story at all plausible, I'd want to see an account of the journey that describes something you'd only find in the Americas and was definitely written before 1492. To move it from plausible to probable, I'd want to see physical evidence of the contact. 

The wikipedia article as well as scientific papers like Janusek 2002 and Ortloff and Kolata 1993 treat the historical existence of the Tiwanaku empire as a fact without offering any evidence corroborating it. The papers are not open access (sorry for that!) but the perspective becomes clear from the abstracts. The papers go on to discuss archaeological evidence for settlement patterns, technology, artifacts etc etc. I understand that archaeological studies may offer solid evidence of a culturally and technologically advanced civilization, but how can it be established that this civilization constituted a state or empire? Pre-Columbian cultures in South America had (almost certainly) no writing system, so contemporary historical accounts do not exist. Is there perhaps evidence from later historical sources? I had a brief look at (an English translation of) Guaman Poma's "The First New Chronicle and Good Government" written by a member of the provincial Peruvian Native American nobility. He gives the probably earliest comprehensive account of Incan and pre-Incan history of the region. However, what he produces in his chapter on pre-Incan history ("Chapter of the Ages of the Indians") is a rather bizarre mix of biblical narrative, contemporary Spanish Christian philosophy and native American mythology. Other historical sources are probably similar. In any case, I fail to see any historical value in this particular chapter of Guaman Poma's work - but maybe historians disagree and manage to squeeze something useful out of it? Or maybe, there are other more informative sources? 

In the early 1800s, when people in the US exported goods to Europe, how were those goods paid for? What did the buyers actually send back on ships crossing the Atlantic to pay for the goods? I can think of a few possibilities 

Is there a single, unified place where one can look up cuneiform signs for Sumerian words? Unicode now supports cuneiform, but every source I've found has only transliterations, not actual cuneiform. For example, I'd like to find this: 

The American Revolution isn't the kind of thing I'm thinking of; everyone knew where the faultlines ran before the revolution began. Benedict Arnold, on the other hand, would be closer to what I'm thinking of; he was a trusted American officer who betrayed his own side, but unsuccessfully. 

During the Cold War, were Soviet naval vessels allowed to use the Panama canal? I'm aware that no Soviet warships happened to use the canal during the Cold War. Was there a rule aganst them transiting the canal, or were they free to do so, even if none actually did? For example, if any Soviet warships went between Atlantic and Pacific by going via a longer route, this would be evidence that they would have used the canal, but that they weren't allowed to. 

Yes, there were. And at the beginning of the women's suffrage movement, suffragettes were viewed by most women as oddities rather than heroic liberators. Basically, centuries ago, due to the technological and economical environment, the family as a unit was much more important than how many people view it today. It was close to impossible to survive (and especially to lead a decent life) alone, especially for a woman. There was no male conspiracy to oppress women. It's just how society formed to optimally face the challenges of their own time period. There were many women during history who had important roles in society, leading back to medieval and even ancient times. Women during the suffragette movement who were against women's suffrage were not just religious fanatics or extremely conservative. There were many well-educated and influential women who were against women entering the realm of politics. Here is an interesting article about it. 

In 1657 a group of English Quakers arrived in New Amsterdam (the Dutch colonial town that became modern New York City). They were persecuted by the colonial government there for their religion. Then in 1663 the colony's bosses - the directors of the Dutch West India Company - ordered the governor to allow Quakerism in the colony. The Company considered the Quaker religion "abominable", yet reversed the governor's policy of persecution, a policy that was entirely in line with the practices of most other European colonies of the day. Why did they order the change? 

But here's the problem -- there were no settlements in Svalbard in 1893, and no ships making regular trips to the archipelago that I could find. What exactly was Nansen's plan for getting home? As always, actual evidence makes for a better answer than guesswork. 

A typical example would be the colonization of America by European settlers, Spanish at the beginning, and other nations later. This is also a good example how a lot of sci-fi alien invasion stories (or youtube anti-European animation films) try to make a parallel and fail miserably: The meeting of the two cultures of different levels of technology didn't happen D-Day style (or in the style of the movie Independence Day), with the newcomers jumping out of the ships and opening fire on the natives standing on the shore. Initially there is usually a period of peaceful coexistence, trade, etc. When later conflicts start to develop (don't forget, over the most of human history war was very common even among groups of the same culture, so conflict will arise sooner or later), it's usually not a total war. In the example of the Americas, in lots of conflicts two or more European powers fought against each other, all having native allies. So it was almost never an "every newcomer combined" versus "every native combined" warfare. Internal conflicts were common on both "sides", if we can even call them "sides", as alliances shifted often. 

Maya society was organized in city states and clans and possibly other entities. Each of these naturally provides its own narratives and mythology from which names would often be chosen. It is therefore common that multiple individuals from similar contexts, e.g. multiple rulers of the same polity, would have similar or identical names. For instance, several of Palenque's (Baak, Lakamha) rulers were named K'inich Janaab' Pakal, while several others bore the name Ahkal Mo' Nahb and still others K'inich Kan Bahlam. The clan name (e.g. Mat, a clan from Palenque) occasionally formed part of the name. For instance, another one of Palenque's rulers is named Ajen Yohl Mat. However, this is not a general rule, and it appears that occasionally individuals not belonging to clan Mat would also bear that element Mat as part of their name, e.g. in the case of individuals that had ancestry from clan Mat though not belonging to this clan themselves. The details of this are not currently well-understood. For a discussion of this particular example, see pages 56-60 in this paper about the rulers of Palenque. Titles like Ajaw (Lord), K'uhul Ajaw (Divine Lord, King), etc. would often be added to the names. Such titles would, as I understand it, typically include a description of what the individual was Lord or King and would follow the name. Title and description would be combined into a single logogram. The same is true for the name. For a description with examples, see e.g. page 8 in the paper referenced above. Note that Mayan writing did not prescribe a particular orthography but allowed any number of ways to phonetically and symbolically combine elements to convey what you want to say. Names may include otherwise unfamiliar characters, as is the case for the names apparently referring to foreign invaders from the Mexican highlands, such as "Owl that will strike" (the Mayan reading of which is unknown) or "Fire is born!" (read Siyaj K'ak'). Edit: I forgot to add, that even though the question refers to names of common people, I am talking about names of the nobility. Very little is known about the classic-period Maya in general, even about the nobility. What little we know is from inscriptions, which are exclusively from the perspective of the upper classes and mainly about the lives of the upper classes. We do not have any texts about naming customs, so everything we have is inferred from names. If naming customs for commoners were markedly different is impossible to know. What we know about the nobility is simply the best approximation of naming customs in general that we have. 

The way he actually got home is as absurd as the expedition itself. After nearly a year in the desolate and uninhabited Franz Josef Land, an unexplored archipelago the size of Serbia, the two men just happened to bump into someone -- and it was even someone Nansen knew personally, Frederick Jackson leading an unrelated expedition. They got a ride back on Jackson's supply ship. 

During the "Heroic Age" of Antarctic exploration (roughly 1890 to 1920), did any expeditions use coal as a fuel or heat source? I'm not just asking what they carried while walking in the interior, I'm interested in what they used at their stationary encampments on the coast as well. Comparing the success and failure of different expeditions, methods of transportation and keeping warm are believed to have made quite a difference. 

The Thule people, ancestors of today's Inuit, are said to have migrated or spread from their homeland in Alaska all the way to Greenland in the far east. How long did this migration take? Was it within a single lifetime? Did it take many generations? I've seen various articles for laymen that claim this migration took anywhere from as little as two years to as much as two centuries. What's the current academic consensus on this one? 

You storm it. You have tens of thousands of men, they have at most a few hundred. However, due to the strategic position and construction of the castle, storming it would be very costly. In the few cases an army in a hurry did do it, it was not uncommon to suffer ten times (or much more) casualties than the defenders. It would almost always be a Pyhrric victory. You besiege it. You start bombarding it until you can breach the walls and can storm it with much less casualties. However, it takes a lot of time, weeks or maybe months, meanwhile you have to delay your main objective. The enemy has time to organize. If winter comes, you probably have to retreat home, and instead of capturing a rich city, you only got an insignificant little fortress. You ignore it and go around. In this case, they will raid your supply caravans. Your large army needs a lot of food, gunpowder, etc, and leaving a fortress behind will make it harder for you to resupply. You will either lose supplies to them, or you need to guard your supplies which takes manpower out of your main army. Long campaigns were almost always decided on supplies. 

In the 1600s, the nature of the moon was a matter of debate. Papers arguing for the modern concept of the moon were being printed, such as The Discovery of a World in the Moone, 1638. The phrase a world in the moon referred to the idea that the moon was a solid, round body on which people could walk about, like our own earth. Today this is completely uncontroversial, which raises my question: In the 1600s, what was the opposing position? If you didn't believe that there was a world in the moon, what did you believe? For example, the authors of the text cited above argued a number of points about the moon: that it was solid, that it was opaque, that it reflected the light of the sun, and (as a separate point) that there was a world in the moon. What did people believe about the moon before such papers convinced them otherwise?
