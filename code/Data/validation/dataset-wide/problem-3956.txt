The answer is yes. Stein operator is essentially no more than a differential equation $E$(written as an operator notation) which characterized a distribution $f$ as its unique solution. That is the reason why Stein operator method allows us to characterize distribution $f_Z$ as a unique solution to $E$. Consider the classic Stein operator $$E:f\mapsto f'(x)-xf(x)$$ and we can choose any $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ which is a bounded continuous function, then the Green function (simultaneously density function of a normal distribution) $$f(x)=e^{\frac{x^{2}}{2}}{\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{x}(g(t)-\boldsymbol{E}_{f_Z}g(Z))e^{\frac{-t^{2}}{2}}dt}$$ is the unique bounded functional solution of the following ODE $$f'(x)-xf(x)=g(x)-\boldsymbol{E}_{f_Z}g(Z)$$ Therefore the question to ask is what kind of $g$ you are looking for to characterize the distribution $f_Z$ using distribution properties of $g(Z),Z\sim f_Z$ to construct something on RHS and that is also why Stein operator is not unique, people usually find it hard to decide $g(x)$ in various applications due to the available measurement methods. For example, if we know some information about the fourth moment of $f_Z$, then I may choose a Stein operator $E_1:f\mapsto f^{(4)}$ and then figure out what kind of $g$ will serve this purpose on the RHS of the equation $Ef= G(\boldsymbol{E}_{f_Z}{Z^4})$. On the other hand if we know what kind of Stein equation we must have, we can equivalently set up the boundary condition of a certain differential equation on the fourth derivative of the characteristic function of $f$ and then seek a solution to theis equation. 

A closed subspace $G$ of a probability Hilbert subspace $H$ is a closed probability space such that it contains $\boldsymbol{1}_G$ and closed under $\vee \wedge$ operations of the lattice. The probability span of $y\in H$ is defined to be the intersection of all probability Hilbert subspaces that contains ${y}$(which is like the way we define ideals/spectrum). Then $E(\bullet\mid y)$ is a projection operator onto the probability span of $y$. [Small&McLeish] contains more details of construction of probability spans.

The reference pointed out by Vincent are both thesis, I think a more appropriate introductory level material is Brown&Yin. And it is the only modern paper that I touched tangential to beta expansion. 

Actually I do not think it is a good idea to model this with nested Poisson processes. The major problem occurs at the very beginning of your analysis. 

Yes and no. Your question is whether the union bound for Fourier transform can be somehow generalized to log Fourier transform for the class of $L^{n+1}(\mathbb{R})$ (for simplicity I do not discuss $\mathbb{R}^n$ domain case). "Yes part". The result you are asked for is basically a Tauberian-type theorem for log Fourier transform that controls the residue in terms of coefficients($\kappa_n$ as in OP). For log Laplace transform $\log\mathbf E e^{tX}$, the result is readily available in Theorem 16.1 of [Korevaar]. We write the density $p(\xi)=dP(\xi)$ and the Laplace transform $\mathcal{L}dP(\xi)=\mathcal{L}dP(\frac{1}{x})=\int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{v}{x}}dP(x)$ according to Part IV Thm 16.1, we have $log\mathcal{L}dP(\xi)=log\mathcal{L}dP(\frac{1}{x})\sim(\alpha-1)\frac{x^{\alpha}L(x)}{x}$ as $x\rightarrow\infty$ where $L(x)$ is the Laplace transform. For harmonic $P$, there are some results similar contained near the end (possibly title "random functions" or something like that, do not have the book at hand now) of [Paley-Wiener]. [Safarov] provides some concrete applications under certain assumptions on $P$'s (say 1.20-1.21). In this regard, "complex Tauberian" or "Fourier Tauberian" are the correct keywords to search for. "No part". Although there are some results in spirit of Tauberian theorems as mentioned above, I do not know there is a result concerning a class as general as $L^{n+1}(\mathbb{R})$. As you already noticed there is such a potentiality of singularities that prevents you from bounding the residues, say Schwartz-class measures and their power polynomials. If you translate the bound on moment generating function $\mathbf E e^{i t X}$ onto $\log\mathbf E e^{itX}$ using the relation between moments and cumulants (see, Mobius (inverse) transform [wiki, Rota]), you will still have $\pm$ cancellation in these relations; However, there is still arising research concerning bounding the tail behavior of a given density using cumulant expansions [Valz et.al], so I guess this is not completely a dead end. This is also (approximately) a question puzzled me a year ago. This answer is my exploration, and I really hope someone more knowledgeable can provide a more complete answer. Hope this helps!

For your first question, Rigollet has a series of notes(with minor typos) that dicusses basics of this kind of tail bounds. The result you mentioned in the "introduction" is actually the classic Hoeffding bound that mentioned by Rigollet in this set of notes. 

Dynkin did not mention why he used the term $\pi$-system in the book cited above(p.202 of [Dynkin2]) but mentioned the notion of $\pi$ and $\lambda$ systems as stated in a measure theoretic appendix. But as mentioned, another origin of the terms is "Sierpinski class"[Sierpinski]. Referring to this source, we can find that (p.14) he specifically discussed the motivation of this definition. To be more precise we not only need it to be "closed under multiplication" but also need the "multiplication be commutative". On the other hand if you examine the Kolmogorov consistency conditions in stochastic processes, you can actually figure out that the set class induced by the inverse image of a consistent finite dimensional distribution class is naturally a $\pi$-system but not necessarily a $\lambda$-system since they do not have to be closed under monotone limits. On the other hand, independent $\pi$-systems $A_1,A_2\cdots $ generated independent $\sigma$-fields $\sigma(A_1),\sigma(A_2),\cdots$. When independent classes $A_1,A_2\cdots$ are not $\pi$-systems the corresponding generating $\sigma$-fields may fail be be independent. If we consider the generating $\sigma$-fields in terms of dual probability Hilbert spaces like [Small&McLeish] then the assumption that $A_1,A_2\cdots $ is $\pi$-system actually guarantee that the probability spans $$PS_i:=\mathrm{ProbSpan}\{\boldsymbol{1}_a,\forall a\in A_i\},i=1,2,\cdots$$ are mutually orthogonal as Hilbert spaces with compatible lattice structure, this means that the requirement of $\pi$-system contains some sort of minimality restriction. So (from my point of view) the $\pi$-system is more or less a natural concept originated from the study of stochastic processes with orthogonal increments(in fact Dynkin proposed it under the title "Markov processes"). Yet the $\lambda$-system is more like a technical term filling the gap between $\pi$-system and the $\sigma$-field. Wild guess below Later I found a more "intuitive explanation". Since [Fristedt&Gray] p.725 made a historical remarks and said that the first occurrence is in [Dynkin] p.1. My curiosity drove me to look at the book. The book is a translated version, thus I took some time to figure out what was it like in the original Russian version(Дынкин, Евгений Борисович. "Основы теории марковских процессов." (1959).), Dynkin used these terms $\pi$ and $\lambda$ from nowhere, but a wild guess may be the capital form of Cyrillic alphabet $\pi\leftrightarrow П$ and $\lambda\leftrightarrow Л$ makes graphical variants of the product symbol $\prod$ but different enough. For the TRUE motivation, we have no way to know but ask Dynkin himself. Reference [Charalambos&Kim]Charalambos D. Aliprantis and Border, Kim C.

It depends. The thin sets $B_t$ are thinned from $B$. As you defined, $B$ can be written as $$B(\rho)=\{x\in\mathcal{X}:\mathbb{E}[(X_{x}-X_{0})^{2}]=\mathbb{E}\left[X_{x}^{2}+X_{0}^{2}-2X_{x}X_{0}\right]=k(x,x)+k(0,0)-2k(x,y)\leq\rho\} $$ according to how you define the covariance $k$, $B(\rho)$ can be convex or not. The final goal is not $B_t$ but $e_n(B)$. If $B$ is convex (it is surely symmetric due to the centered Gaussian setup.), then Theorem 4.1 combined with Theorem 1.2 is what you asked for. However, if you choose some $k$ where $B$ is not convex, then you need to figure out a convex envelope of $B$ and apply Theorem 4.1 onto it again. Concerning $B_t$, you can use a covering of $\ell_p$-ball OR octahedra shown in Sec 3 and take the union bound as a coarser bound. Question 2 

First of all, you are mixing many questions into one post... It depends on what do you mean by "generalization". And I am not sure what you mean by talking about "commutative" without mentioning notion of "exchageability" or "conditional independence". The classical probability theory dealt with dependent random variables, but usually they are discussed in stochastic process like autocorrelation process, where the dependent relation is tractable. In free probability, the dependence could be wilder. 

You may want to have a look into Hwang's Lemma which is known as a discrete (sufficient) analogy to Stein's Lemma though it is NOT a characterization. Generally speaking you can yield such a characterization when the undelying probability distribution is restricted to full rank regular exponential family because in that case you are actually characterizing the linear structure of the probability density. 

A bayesian network corresponds to an independence (algebraic) variety and hence to a polynomial ring over $\mathbb{R}$. You can start from 

Even if you fixed attention to a specific path $\omega$, the corresponding measure of the sample path $m_\omega$ gives you a joint pdf of order statistics as you pointed out, it may not apply to another path $\omega*$ and associated $m_{\omega*}$ because we do not have any useful information to relate $m_{\omega}$ and $m_{\omega*}$. There are some exceptions like Brownian motion with path continuity, but when the state space is discrete (Markov chain), there is no hope to relate probability measures associated with different paths. Problem 2 A unified approach to the problem of order(actually only maximal) statistics is to consider the Markov renewal process defined in seminal papers [2,3,4]. In this theory, the renewal theory of Markov chains (instead of i.i.d. random variables) are built. The Markov renewal processes are one of the most important examples of semi-markov chains as you pointed out in Stone's paper. However there are central limit theorem type results (Theorem 7.1 in [3]) and law of large number result in [3] that allows you to compute the counts of renewals. Given a sample path $\omega$, we can compute the distribution of $N(t)$, the number of renewals in the path $\omega$ up to time $t$. As soon as we get access to $N(t)$ we can also compute the distribution of maximas i.e. $\mathbb{P}(X(t) = X_{(n)})$ for a path up to time $n$. The best we can do, even in an ordinary renewal process, is to integrate it out as shown in [5]. The obstacle that prevents us from doing that in this case is that you need to integrate out Markov random variables instead of i.i.d random variables, where ordinary integral does not apply and usually do not have closed form.

If what you said is: $U(1) \cong \mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Z \cong \S^{1} $ Why not try to calculate the $H^3[U(1)\times U(1),U(1)] \cong H^d[S^{1} \times S^{1},S^{1}]$ in that way as a product? In that case, you can simply use the cellular cohomology where the cohomology groups are directly obtained via applying the $Hom( ,Z)$ onto the corresponding homology chain complex $H_{k}[U(1)\times U(1),U(1)]$. Step1: Observe or calculate the $H_{k}[U(1)\times U(1),U(1)]$ via Device Lemma 

Partly inspired by recent developments in enumeration of pattern avoiding permutations, which is known to be connected with Brownian excursions [Hoffman&Rizzolo]. The exciting milestone is the solution of Stanley–Wilf conjecture (BTW Wilf is the same person in this post) in 2004 [Marcus&Tardos] characterizing the pattern-avoiding permutations by limiting the number of such permutations to be $C^n$($C$ being constant) among all permutation of length $n$ in $\mathcal{S}_n$. And Fox showed that the $C$ is almost surely exponential[Fox]. The problem I have in mind is about random permutations acting on a fixed set $M$.

There is a more general proof for Thm 2.3 in [1], shown in details by the same authors in a later paper [2]. Theorem 2.3 in [1] is the same as Theorem 1.2 in [2] with different notations. And the partition of unity should follow the same lines in the proof of Theorem 1.3 of [2]. The proof in details you asked for is in Sec 4 of [2]. In [2] they proved the theorem as a special case of Theorem 1.1 of [2], and in the process of proving Theorem 1.1 of [2], they also proved (Theorem 1.3 in [2]) the sub-elliptic inequality $$\left|\left\{ x\in B_{R}:\left|u(x)\right|>\lambda\right\} \right|^{\frac{Q-1}{Q}}\leq C_{3}\frac{1}{\lambda}E|B_{R}|^{\frac{-1}{Q}}\int_{B_{R}}|D_{X}u|dx$$ for some constant $C_3$. So the roadmap is $Thm1.3\rightarrow Thm1.4\text{(isoperimetric)}\rightarrow Thm1.1\rightarrow Thm1.2\text{(special case,=Thm2.3 in [1])}$. The partition of unity occurs in the proof of Thm 1.3 $$I_{\alpha}^{1}f(x)=\int_{B(x,\epsilon)}|f(\xi)|\frac{d(x,\xi)^{\alpha}}{|B(x,d(x,\xi))|}d\xi$$ $$I_{\alpha}^{2}f(x)=\int_{B(x,\epsilon)^{C}\cap B_{R}}|f(\xi)|\frac{d(x,\xi)^{\alpha}}{|B(x,d(x,\xi))|}d\xi$$ and then in the proof of Thm2.1 of [2], the author argued that both $I_\alpha$ can be bounded from above. This is formally a partition of unity, but its spirit is more like Calderon-Zygmund type argument. $$I_{\alpha}^{1}f(x)\leq C_{4}Mf(x)\epsilon^{\alpha}$$ where $M$ is the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator over $B(x,r),r>0$, $$I_{\alpha}^{2}f(x)\leq C_{5}R^{Q}|B_{R}|^{-1}\epsilon^{\alpha-Q}\left\Vert f\right\Vert _{L^{1}(B_{R})}$$ with $C_4,C_5$ being constants. Let $I_\alpha=I_\alpha^1+I_\alpha^2$, then let $\alpha=1$ we reach Thm 1.3 and hence Thm 1.4 hence Thm 1.1. As a corollary we get Thm 1.2(Your Thm2.3).The details in proving the bound of $I_\alpha$'s are extremely obscure(for me), so please do read [2] for details.
