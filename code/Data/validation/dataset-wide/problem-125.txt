The good There is precedent for cooperation in space exploration as well as how 'new continents' are treated here on Earth. The gist is that resources and aesthetics are protected as much as possible on Earth, and that everything done in space is for peaceful purposes. The bad Unfortunately neither of the above scenarios is recognized by all countries and peoples on Earth. The likely I was first going to scoff that the United Nations would have nothing to do with it, but then realized you're talking about a continent that is 'a little more difficult to get to,' (as in, outer space). In this case the countries with the most access would also be countries who happen to put the most support for the United Nations, with the exception of China and maybe India. I suspect the demarcation, therefore, since it is a very slow colonization process, will be 'first come first serve.' The tiny colonies on a large planet will likely even break away a bit from their home countries as well: think of a thousand scientists and engineers from, say, India, and how different they might be from the politics of their country? Speculatively, I think the best precedent would be Antarctica, since you will have people there for science and when colonization occurs, it will likely be corporate cooperative and a public-private-partnership with governments, since it will take years and a lot of money to even get ready to go there; with the blessing of home government and the UN. Transnational corporations do not closely ally themselves with a country. 

Make a Warren Ground sometimes collapses because of the activity of gophers and rabbits digging a series of interconnected tunnels. 

EDIT Competition - this is actually the most important factor. Forests are changing constantly over eras, but one of the drivers is competition. Pine trees, for example, are found in the dry hills where they're able to survive better than their competitors. But you will find them in wet climates, where they are slowly being outcompeted - forests are always changing. 

Adept Stealth It's not unlikely for a creature to bury its dung, and to adapt to leave very little trace of itself. For those living in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, they've plenty of space to roam and to avoid the (usually loud) approaches of logging trucks and even hunters. But for those that get stumbled upon, well there's a lot of unsubstantiated reports. Unexplored Areas Vele Do Javari, in Brazil is an unexplored area about the size of Austria, Kamchatka, in Russia about the size of California only allowed a few military people to the area, and with its many brown bears, a great ape could be mistaken for a bear in the improbable event it was ever stumbled upon. Sakha Republic as well, is about the size of India and is largely untouched where the few great apes have a diet of small plants and reindeer. Parts of Patagonia as well as large parts of southeast Asia are largely unexplored as well. 

A Bit Different There are zillions of contributing factors to climate (we don't even fully understand our own), so I'm just going to take a stab at it: this is speculation based on limited information and observation of systems here. Hot & Cold - with the major currents being disrupted by archipelagos (some in shallow waters, others, like Hawaii, the product of a slowly moving hot spot), the temperatures at central lattitudes will be very hot, but also very rainy with so much evapotranspiration. The poles, without a stream pulling warm water northward, will be very cold, though slightly less so in their summers. Stormy - while island archipelagos can be mountainous and even have different climates on one small island, the continuous disruption of landform allows for storms to accumulate and 'travel' further and longer. Islandia is going to have lots of hurricanes at the equatorial region. Fossil aquifers - you will want these in your more temperate and colder regions. Without major mountain systems, you don't get your large, collecting rivers for fresh water. Rain will not be as prevalent in the temperate and colder latitudes So let's give these guys some spring water. The temperate zones are going to be the sweet spot, where you can hopefully have seasons a rich diversity of fishing/whaling as the staple meat, and a lot less tropical storms. Bonus: Fauna - you didn't ask, but I suspect, like most small island chains, you will have a great diversity, but no large land animals, such as 'lions and tigers and bears, oh my'. Large land animals need a hella lot of area to cover for food, both herbivore and carnivore (usually). Your small herbivores and rodents (although greatly diverse from each other) will be your land animals, but the coolest thing? Your birds might rule the skies: and you might have very large, and strong birds. Fish - Good luck with this one: I think even though we have separation on Earth that keeps species apart, I would guess we'd see the same patterns here, although with your population, they will be threatened by overfishing. 

Yes. Not only reasonable, but it did happen. In addition to mountains and forest, you might consider desert. Near where I live, there are many Arabic cities that flourished in the 10th century and beyond, simply because they were a place for boats to stop, trade, and replenish water supplies. While Jeddah was a conduit for pilgrims to Mecca, the remainder of the Arabian coast along the Red Sea, in Oman (Muscat), Dubai, parts of India, were all places to stop and do the mentioned activities. Often these stops had access to fossil aquifers and wells and were stops for dhows or larger ships to/from Europe and Asia (I have a book about Venetian merchants stopping in Delma, which means "to bring water", in the United Arab Emirates). These 'refueling' stops were also an opportunity for a great deal of trade and created bustling settlements. 

Cities ranging from 30,000 to 150,000 people are dotted across the planet. For purposes of travel, our protagonists need to travel under-sand, in order to avoid detection from orbit. Setting aside the technological issues related to the sustainability of the cities and the events going on, using our tech level, how can a crew of 30 people travel up to 50km at a time under sand? EDIT: The detection is entirely by visible detection (no infrared, etc.) with a quality such as a 'live' google-maps. 

It helps that she's in Russia. Even moreso, if she's in, say, Yakutsk. But, let's keep it in a big city; she could consider the following. Wintertime - Going about business in winter, in Russia, wearing lots of layers and covered head, face & neck was not an odd sight (well, this was ten years ago). She could consider seasonal activity, and mostly outdoors work, like construction or running a shop, like a Baltik at a busy intersection. The Internet & Acceptance - Building a network of well-meaning people (however small) is critical for anyone, not to mention someone with peculiar attributes. The Internet brings a wide variety of people together, and I see no reason why a little research won't help find the right ones. Often, this becomes a geographical reality; we have a neighborhood of cat clowns (don't ask me: it's Portland, Oregon), who go about their day, working at the post office, taking out the trash, etc., dressed as cat clowns. So an accepting home and group of friends will have to be sought out. The Internet v2 - You can get almost anything online now, for the summer months. Groceries, hardware, etc. are available for delivery in larger cities; even, presumably in Russia's major cities. Own it - Be known by ignorant people as a freak of nature and by intelligent people as someone special. Go on TV shows for a little spending cash. Crime - Your character sounds adept, so if you want to go that way with your story, it should be easy. Happy writing! 

Reroute It Upstream Somewhere at a higher elevation, there's a section of the river that winds near an alternate route for the river. Your mischeivous folks up the mountain cut through the barrier (ice, rocks, or just plain land) and the river suddenly has an entirely new route. The river now floods down the opposite side of the great mountain. 

I'd like the six towers to be glass, and about 10 stories high; imitation of Western lighthouses. The foundation is sandstone jebloon (or little rocky mountains). What will the requirements and limitations be? Where should stone supports be? There are no issues with security, or storms, and the engineers have been given the best engineering literature from North Africa to the Levant and Arabia (imagine they have access to the sum of the Islamic renaissance, for this question). 

Tech level is early Rome, China, Ethiopia, etc. ~ first century BC. Unlike history, there's peace and cooperation among all the benign monarchies of the whole Earth. But it's hard to get daily communication from (now) peaceful Rome to (now) peaceful imperial China, for example, and back to Ethiopia. Horses are not fast enough, heck even the mighty camel is not to the emperor's satisfaction. What would be a faster and more efficient way to rapidly transfer regular (say "once-a-week") messages across vast land distances, given plenty of existing resources, 1BC tech level, a few decades of research beforehand, humankind cooperation, and our expertise as WorldBuilders? Note: Keep in mind, there's almost entirely "peace on Earth" among the 300 million or so global population, and since it's land-transport, I can omit the Americas, unless you have a clever solution to that, focusing on the "over land" portion.
