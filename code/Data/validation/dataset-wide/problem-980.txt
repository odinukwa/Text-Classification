I believe the NCL function NCL gaus should be able to give you the solution you are looking for. From the API documentation you are requested to provide - the number of latitude points per hemisphere and you should get Gaussian latitudes and Gaussian weights. Here is a code sample from their website 

You can try CMORPH data set- CMORPH Description. As explained in the original reference - CMORPH publication the authors obtain half hourly global precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave satellite scans and they are propagated by motion vectors derived from geostationary IR data. So these are spatially and temporally complete microwave based precipitation estimates independent of the IR temperature field. The reason why it is called a "MORPH" is because shape and intensity of the precipitation estimates are modified during the time between two successive microwave scans by a time weighted linear interpolation scheme. The flexibility of CMORPH indicates it can enhance the value Global Precipitation Mission Data by combining IR scans with GPM and hence increasing the temporal resolution of GPM to thirty minutes. CMORPH can be downloaded from Download URL. If you are only downloading via OPeNDAP you can get it from the RDA RDA CMORPH1 and RDA CMORPH2 

I could only find this old reference(30 years old) Typhoon Structure As Revealed By Aircraft Reconnaissance. Part 2: Structural Variability by Weatherford And Gray 1988. The conclusion of the authors is that the size of a tropical cyclone's eye does not have much of a observable relationship with the cyclone central pressure(MSLP) and is shown as a weak correlation. Observations reveal that the contracting eye size of a TC on the average is associated with a decreasing MSLP and an expanding eye size is associated with a increasing central pressure. So let's look at some actual numbers from that above paper - These are again averages for the period 1980-82 tropical cyclones that have been classified on the basis of size of the eyewall

I use Carl Schreck's site Equatorial Wave Zoo for monitoring atmospheric waves such as Kelvin wave, Equatorial Rossby wave, filtered MJO OLR, Mixed Rossby Wave(MRG),etc. Here is an example - Kelvin Wave OLR In addition I use Matt Wheeler's BOM site(unavailable at the moment) for the same information. Now I am getting interested in the ocean and it's characteristics as part of my effort in learning coupled models i.e. air - sea models. Is there a site for monitoring equatorial oceanic waves(in real time with lag) such as oceanic Kelvin wave, Rossby wave etc ? That should help me in identifying along the equator at least where upwelling or downwelling is likely to occur. I would prefer a site for my basin i.e. Indian Ocean. 

The formation of twin cyclones does occur in both the Indian Ocean as well as the Western Pacific with the Indian Ocean twins being weaker . Schubert et al Symmetric Twin Tropical Cyclones report that the October through May is the period of formation of twin tropical cyclones with December through February being the maximum frequency. The original definition of twin tropical cyclones was provided by Keen in 1982 Cross Equatorial Pairs in the Southern Oscillation. Apart from high SSTs you also need conditions of intense low level vorticity. The convection associated with the eastward propagating Madden Julien Oscillation(MJO) contains cyclonic Rossby gyres that favour tropical cyclogenesis. If students are wondering what and where are the cyclonic gyres this image may help in that regard- please pay attention to the cyclonic gyres at the 850 hPa level that trail the convection 

Lander performs case studies for the twin cyclones Lola and Namu in the 1986 Pacific Typhoon season - 1986 Pacific Typhoon Season A more recent reference Schreck et al. A case study of an outbreak of twin tropical cyclones have performed studies that conclude that a broad and long lasting envelope of warm water, low surface pressure and easterly shear are other conditions that are required for formation of twin cyclones. Students can watch the video in this URL Cyclone Pam and Bavi and see the twin cyclone activity 

In addition to the other two answers this article Relation between Rainfall and El Nino in Iran evaluates the relation between quantum of rainfall in Iran during El Nino years. The study concludes that an increase of rainfall is seen across the Iranian plateau during El Nino years and a decrease of rainfall is seen across coastal areas. On the whole El Nino years are beneficial for Iran. The author does perform a correlation study using Pearson's method and conclude a meaningful relationship does exist at the 0.01 significance level. Considering Iran's geography and arid lands this would suggest a more careful management of water resources and ensure the rainfall is harvested through watershed management. The following study confirms the above findings On the relationship between ENSO and autumn rainfall in Iran and reports that El Nino episodes produce greater rainfall than La Nina episodes. The regions that benefited the most are the southern foothills of Alborz mountains, northwestern districts and central areas. Sources of moisture appear to be the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. There is no evidence to suggest that the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean are sources of moisture. In addition the following study Effects of El Nino Southern Oscillation on the Discharge of Kor River in Iran conclude that efforts need to be directed at flood and drought predictability. 

I would like to extend the answer by Jeopardy Tempest and provide an alternate view of other clouds that can discharge lightning and this answer will focus more on the observational view of lightning. The most recent review on this subject can be found in this excellent book Lightning Physics And Effects by Vladimir Rakov and Martin Uman. In general cloud bases usually have negative charge and when you have cloud to ground discharge from the base of the cloud that is called as negative lightning and when the discharge happens from the top of the cloud (which is positively charged) that is called positive lightning. There exists an electrical dipole between the top and base of the cloud. I am going to describe three other cases where electrical discharge and lightning have been observed apart from the cumulonimbus case 1) Stratiform precipitation from mesoscale convective complexes(MCC) Electric field measurements above mesoscale convective systems From this paper the authors report two luminous features above MCCs namely red sprites and blue jets. Sprites usually occur above the stratiform cloud that trail the convective line in MCCs. Their measurements are basically electric field magnitudes and they conclude that discontinuities in the electric field above MCCs were caused by positive cloud-to-ground lightning flashes.These positive ground flashes were detected by the National Lightning Detection Network within 1 s of the electric field discontinuity seen above the cloud with the balloon-borne electric field meter. Voltages inside and just above thunderstorms This following study concludes that lightning contributions from mesoscale convective complexes(MCS) stratiform clouds and thunderstorm anvils does contribute to the overall global electrical circuit and the average cloud top voltage was +32 million volts above two MCS stratiform clouds and above a thunderstorm anvil. 2)Stratus, Stratocumulus and Nimbostratus - Electricity of Clouds by Imyanitov et al. Imyanitov's pioneering work in the early 1970s in Russia done with aircraft reveal that charge density of Stratus, Stratocumulus and Nimbostratus are comparable to those of thunderclouds. Pilots have reported damage by lightning in non thunderstorm clouds such as nimbostratus and altostratus. 3) Winter lightning - Has lightning been observed during winter storms ? It would seem somewhat contrary to the conventional view is that lightning is a phenomenon associated with the season of summer. However in Japan several cases of winter lightning have been studied using radar echoes as shown in this reference - A Study of Radar Echoes and their Relation to Lightning Discharges of Thunderclouds in the Hokuriku District Part II: Observation and Analysis of "Single-Flash" Thunderclouds in Midwinter and these are the conclusions 

From my country there is indeed a saltwater river in the north western state of Rajasthan - Luni river. It is not salty from the point of it's origin but does become salty as it flows downstream. Here is a more complete description of the Luni river - Luni River basin facts. Looking at this book - Contributions to the ecology of halophytes one wonders on the accumulation of salt in these arid basins. Considering the basin is in proximity to the Great Rann of Kutch there were earlier conjectures that the atmosphere carried the salts as either particles or sprays of sea water. Wider acceptance of the origin of salt these days is due to the atmospheric decomposition of feldspathic rocks and leaching by rain water. It is probably the only river of consequence in the Western part of Rajasthan which forms part of the Thar desert
