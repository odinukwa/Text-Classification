"Should one be shaving on a lengthy high altitude trek?" shall be the question that I'd like to ask to great mountaineers with wisdom in high-altitude mountaineering. If you have observed, there are so many mountaineers who do not prefer (or should I say bother?) to shave during an expedition. Has it got any scientific or significant reason for they being aberrant, beyond the lethargic approach of being socially good? (Culture is different up there at the mountains) Of course, a shaving trimmer is a handy instrument to take along, what are the pros and cons of shaving against not shaving, and vice versa? For example, having a face covered with beard can really keep your jaws from freezing? But, then do we jeopardize the hygiene, as we may not face wash everyday? P.S.: I am restricting the scope of the question to Facial Hair only. 

Assuming that you are not going to use if for checking fever. There are other ways to check fever. There is no mechanism, or a piece of equipment (other than dedicated thermal transducers) I have heard of that can measure the temperature precisely. If you are just curious about how hot/cold the ambiance is, you can pull out your cellphone and get that data anytime you want. If you just want to know if it is getting colder with the time, look for a cat, the more it curls, the colder it is getting. 

Main difference: The right one goes on the right foot, the left one goes on the left foot. :P But seriously, there should be no difference at all apart from the . After all you don't want your left foot, for example, to be padded more strongly or lightly than your right foot. Or for your right heel to have more/less grip than your left heel... 

Living or spending time at higher altitudes will increase your performance via the number of red blood cells you have in your blood. Athletes do this to increase their performance (after they redescended that is), in which case we are speaking of Altitude Training. The effect originates in the differences in partial pressure of gazes at different altitudes (notably oxygen, read more here). This difference does not start or stop at a certain altitude, but is a gradual change. People can acclimatize to higher altitudes - it seems fairly obvious that somebody who already lived at a couple of thousand meters above sea level has a 'head start' when it comes to acclimatizing to a trip of, say, 6000m. That does not mean that somebody who lives at high altitude is guaranteed to be immune/resistant to AMS though. It is basically impossible to tell beforehand who might develop AMS and who will not - even repeated experience at high altitude does not mean you're safe. --> Basically the only way to proceed safely is to just treat everyone the same, go slowly following the best practices, and, most importantly, keeping an eye open if anyone is developing symptoms. 

Ah, that sounds really painful and disturbing. Your description is more like its a Boil than a Blister. Medically, 

There are so many things to consider when you calculate one such thing, and it would again involve a lot of data, equations and that too with subtle variations in data. For an example, there are people walking at different speeds, there would be differences, especially between walking and running. You know, with trekking/hiking, its practically hard to draw a line between walking-like pace and almost-running-like a pace, and to add to mathematical complexity, there is another brisk walking kind of thing, that too considered along with Physiological data of the person? Like Height, weight, etc? So, the Highly accurate estimations are specific to the individual. To consider those details for getting approximate measure of Calories burnt during a hike, a detailed bio-mechanical study of walking (and running) on steep gradient would be required for an appropriate characterization of the gait and for a clear identification, from the measure of contact times, of the transition from a walking-like to a running-like gait when the differences between walking and running tend to disappear. There has been a long debate over if the Speed really has anything to do with Work done, but I personally feel that, speed does play a (minor) factor in changing mechanical efficiency of human movement, may be a runner can tell better. It could have been better if one consider the analytical data about Level Walking and Level Running and, how and why the difference between the Work done in both the case is subtle. Speaking of gradients, When walking or running on positive gradients (ascends), both increases as the function of the incline (Elevation). So we can actually get away with obtaining the closer approximations if we consider walking, based on the fact that the approximation of considering just the mechanical potential work (and disregarding the kinetic one) because it is assumed that beyond a given gradient the rise (or descent) of the center of mass (consider, the load that you carried?) is the prevailing contributor to the mechanical external work. 

If you are very lucky, there are rich natural sulfur deposits readily available nearby. An example of such a place is Indonesia and Eastern Java, where blocks of Sulfur can basically be picked up like rocks from the ground. --> Note that such locations are very rare and will generally be colocated with zones of strong geologic activity/volcanoes/hot springs. Outside of such very lucky circumstances sulfur is generally mined using various techniques. There exist also various chemical extractions and processes used to gain sulfur: 

Side remark: directly heating with electricity is a fairly expensive and very very inefficient/un-ecological idea to begin with. That holds doubly so in a tent which provides virtually no insulation. 

If you can constantly feel them hitting your head and see them on your clothes, you should easily be able to get them trapped on something sticky. Try an adhesive bug trap or simply some double sided tape. If you need to make them more visible, how about using a very strong light source? At least dust particles can be made visible easily like this, so this should also work for any kind of insect. 

Merino wool (e.g. IceBreaker shirts & long underpants) is very warm compared to its pack size and weight. It combines well with most other outdoor clothing like fleece - and you'll be wearing lots of it. Just to put it into perspective: In winter Irkutsk has an average temperature of around -20°C/0°F. Average. Meaning you need to be prepared for temps as low as -30°C to -40°C. Adding to that the wind chill effect from driving around in a side car, you'll be needing some serious low-temperature equipment. I'd hit up your local outdoor supplier and have a good talk with them about this subject. Snowmobiling equipment and expedition clothes will likely be needed. 

I used the same breathing pattern while ascending Mt. Kanamo last season. Its not a tough mountain to climb, absolutely non-technical peak. People usually set up the summit camp (At about 4600 m) after a couple of hours of hike from village (Kibber, used to be world's highest village) and then start early in the day for summit which sits at 5974 m (officially, but on both attempts my GPS ticked 6025 m). The ascend part didn't trouble me whatsoever. 

It boils down to the point what one could really do in such a situation. When I trek in India, I do come across such situations that beg some action from me and other sensitive people around. I define scope of 'what can I do' as following: 

Considering a scenario that one is hiking a lot in the indian sub-continent, what is better in order to mitigate the issues one may face due to bright sunny day? A hat or a simple cap? 

Probably something that doesn't come off while walking in tall grass, but does come off quick when you want it to, also fast to tie up again is the knot you are looking for. I usually prefer Ian's Secure knot. Such a brilliant link! There is a pair of shoes which have a slightly longer laces which I deliberately didnt change, with them I use Mega Ian's knot. I don't know if anybody has tried the method below or not, but this worked for me: I have shoes with ankle support (whether they are good or bad is different question), When I am done tieing the shoelace, I do a bit of stretching and see if it restricts my ankle movement by any means. If it does, I loosen it up a bit and then I am good to go. For what I have observed, if you tie up too tight, with usual hiking shoes you won't feel much of a difference in the tarsal region and overall foot, but you will where the neck of the shoe comes in contact, either near the ankle (if they are not ankle-high) or above the ankle where the shin begins (if they have ankle support). A side-note: Elasticity of the shoelace also comes in picture when its about how secure a knot is! 

This is an edge case, but I'll add it nonetheless: If you are hiking above the polar circle during summer, hiking during the 'night' will give you the rare chance to experience the wonder that is the midnights sun in the endless nordic summer. There is nothing quite like starting a climb after dinner, summiting a mountain and having a snack in the midnights sun. Of course the same applies for hikes in the far south (those are not quite as easily reachable though, as you need to be on Antarctica). 

In addition to Charlie's answer on building a shelter: Make sure you don't have to move once the storm hits. You'll likely hardly be able to walk around safely, so make sure you're in the best spot already. 

Trail running backpack While I think for touring bike bags are the way to go they are horrible for mountain biking in serious terrain. What I personally do on longer bike tours is to wear a trail running backpack. These are ultra-light backpacks that sit very high on your back and generally have a sophisticated system of straps to be very secure even while running long distances. In my experience this makes them uniquely suited also for mountain biking, as they will 

Once I had gone off-road cycling my nephew in remote regions. The kid asked me, "Why haven't you ever climbed that mountain?", pointing at a mountain I didn't know the name of. I said, "I just may some day. But I haven't because I hadn't seen that before and there is hardly anyone who gets here." 

Practices: The first thing I would ensure is, pick a place that you already have been to. Do not go to a place that you are not familiar with. Just drive easy and slow than you usually do. Pick the least bumpy road. Most importantly, I would allow them to have a good time doing the stuff they love to do, obviously with a caring-keen eye on them. 

Typically runners exert their lungs the most if compared to Mountaineers. I am strictly not comparing with Swimmers of course. First, why would it happen, how do you know whats happening: Do we normally catch cold, runny nose when its cold outside? Normally we do. "How much cold" can vary from person to person though. Getting runny nose is one of the body's defense mechanisms. Phlegm is the substance that contains mucus (a protective substance) and other bacteria, bluntly saying which is produced by Respiratory System, to be precise by Mucus Membranes. Respiratory Mucus protects the whole Respiratory tract and the lungs by trapping foreign particles that are inhaled through the nose when we breathe. It also helps to heat-up the inhaled air before it reaches the lungs. So, 

I'm thinking about getting into geocaching with my girlfriend, as it sounds like an activity that we'd both enjoy a lot. However I really don't think that I want to buy a dedicated GPS device if at all avoidable. On one hand I don't want to spend the money, on the other it'll just be one more device to keep around, make sure it's charged, upgrade firmware or maps, etc. 

Many examples for trail running backpacks can be found on Google. The one I personally use for moutain biking is MTR 201 from Mammut: 

I'll try to give a fairly generic answer to this broad question... Avoid Dangers This is obvious really, but first and foremost you'll want to avoid any kind of routes which lead you close to dangers. What's dangerous and what isn't and which levels of danger you'll be prepared to accept will depend highly on your skill level, your environments/weather, the mountain in question, etc. 

When I was a kid I repeatedly made simple bows from hazel trees/shrubs. The main advantage here is that it grows in very handy, more or less uniformly thick branches that are very appropriate in size to use as bows (also make good walking sticks/spears). As strength/durability of the bow was never an issue we used freshly cut, green branches - obviously a no-go for any serious longbow. If the latter is what you're going for, I advise using yew or ash stems (not branches) of at least 15 cm in diameter that have been stored and dried for about 12 months. But in this case you'll need to look into some detailed manuals on bow making anyway. 

Its somewhat wrong to say a leak, I should rather say a small hole. But how would you go about sealing/fixing it? I know many of us would say, "Why so much trouble? trash it, and get a new one", but still I'd like to receive any ideas if you can think of. 

A snake sees (senses) you before you can see it, so be assured that it does know you are around. Thats why in most of the cases it will start rattling, but please note that when the rattle is wet, it makes no noise. Needless to say, If you see a rattlesnake coiled and/or rattling, that means it’s agitated. Keep away, Leave it alone. Wait for the snake to leave the trail. Do not shout at it, it can't hear, it has no external ears like us. Do not make sudden movements, instead back away slowly. Though Snakes do not see well, they have Jacobson's Organ which is an olfactory organ allowing it to process the chemical senses received by flipping of the tongue. Vipers, as they are called Pit Vipers have pits (looks similar to nostrils) to sense 1/1000th fraction of change in per oC. It usually perceives sudden movement as a threat. Diving for cover doesn't make sense. 

Limit your carbon footprint Limiting your carbon footprint is just one of the many ways you can try to protect nature from the impact of man. It is an important one though. 

Maybe barbed wire fences are built differently in different parts of the world - at any rate, nobody really mentioned the way that we as kids learned to cross them safely. Crossing on top in the middle between two posts: Most often barbed wire fences are not very tightly strung, especially if they're not very new - meaning that the individual wires will have some slack to them. 

It's also my understanding that the way square-rigged sails are set up they won't achieve the usual 'wing-shape' cross section that, say, a fore-and-aft rig will achieve. Do a square-riggers sails also provide "airplane wing-style" propulsion, or do they only work in what the above article describes as the 'kite' type of providing push. I'm asking because one of the linked questions at the beginning actually cites a Hornblower novel - in which I would expect the ship in question to be a square-rigger - wetting it's sails. And while the wetting of the sails also seems to have other effects (swelling of fibers making sails less permeable) it would seem that the 'aicraft-wing-style' (please let me know if there is a better term for this :P) propulsion would be a lot more important, seeing that it allows you to achieve higher speeds generally.
