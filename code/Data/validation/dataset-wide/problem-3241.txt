Anyone with an advanced education in either the secular or religious fields would know Latin. It was what most literature taught was written in, and all the religious texts. 

The actual answer is that Pettigrew's troops on the third day achieved the high water mark. The stone wall that formed the federal line had a zig zag and was closer to the front where Pickett struck the wall. His men crossed the wall, but not far, only a few feet to capture the battery there. To Pickett's left, further north, the wall moved directly east 80 yards (known as the Angle) then turned north again. Pettigrew's troops reached that wall, but did not cross it, but undoubtedly got farther than any of Pickett's men did except as prisoners. Wright's claim to have reached the crest is a lot less convincing, and is usually considered post-war "coulda shoulda woulda" thinking. The counterattacking forces of Stannard were coming from the North, more or less down the ridgeline and moved forward to attack. There were also 6th corps units from the front that would have been between him and any rosy vision of the Baltimore Pike, which was about a mile off and invisible in the darkness that was descending on the field at the time - it was well past sunset. It is far more likely Wright mistook one of the many interim positions taken by delaying forces after the 3rd corps was shattered for the military crest of Cemetery Hill. 

No, because much if not all of the Persian Fleet consisted of contributions from Greek cities and thus had "free" rowers as well. Slave rowers are really a creation of the medieval period, not ancient times, despite what Ben Hur says. Persia was a landlocked nation and had no naval tradition. However, its conquest of Asia Minor and the shores of the Mediterranean gave it access to many nations such as Tyre in Phoenicia, perhaps Rhodes, and the Greek city states in Asia Minor. These made up its fleet, but there is no reason to think that they enslaved the rowers for kicks. They were also reinforced just before the battles by the fleets of new subject cities in Thrace. Again, there's no time for changing the status of the rowers. Also, the story of the battle of Salamis is one of the Greeks winning by restricting the battlefield rather than winning by bold maneuvers. If the Greeks had an edge in mobility, this strategy would negate it, not enhance it. 

Go to the bow. Pass the line under the bowsprit and let out line on both ends until it is in the water. Walk back to midships. When done, let go of one end and haul away. 

Serbia basically agreed to most everything, except turning over Serbians to A-H without any proof, and denied responsibility for private citizens talk about A-H. 

I imagine the any action between Eurasian steppe tribes from the Mongols back to their ultimate forebears would qualify. 

This term was the go-to term for the more deeply committed hard war Republicans by historians for the next 75 years or more. They tended to be the ones committed to winning the war, freeing the slaves, and assuring in Reconstruction that slaves were not essentially re-enslaved again. They managed two out of three. It was a 'thing' for a long time to try and draw a large distinction between Lincoln and this group, but I never found that too convincing. It always appeared to me it was a way to malign this first try at Civil Rights without saying it right out. 

I agree that most quantitative measures in the commentaries are right on the money. The exception would probably be the size of enemy armies and the casualties inflicted, as there is a more or less universal inflating of these numbers in all historical works, ancient and modern. 

If you look at post-historical migrations, there are instances of Case 1 - Rome in Britain, Asia Minor. For Case 2 - Caesar mentions some Germans invited into part of Gaul peacefully. For case 3 - German migrations into West Roman Empire, Turks in Asia Minor post Manzikert. This leaves case 4 and 5 which I can't recall a single provable instance in written history. This would also take a pretty organized state to pursue such a rigorous course, which is unlikely to be possible so long ago. Up until recently, Linguists seemed to assume that language was almost an innate part of a people and thus a language change meant a change in the people themselves. More recently, though, it is found that if there is an advantage, customs and languages will change without much or any demographic change. 

This famous photo is known to have been to been taken on VE Day in New York. Note the man in the rear in the identical sailor uniform, and the kisser is in a dark version of the same. 

The main reason you don't hear about German offensive victories on the Western Front after Normandy is that there aren't any. The Germans did have a localized offensive in Falaise to try and stop the Allied breakout, which resulted in about 225000 captured. Market-Garden was a defensive battle, in which they beat back an ill conceived operation. At most other places along the front the Germans managed to block the Allied offensives as their force petered out in the autumn of 1944. True offensives were rare to absent, which is the major reason Bulge itself was such a surprise. 

1) Chariots never charged any formed infantry, ever. They relied on the infantry breaking first at the sight. If they did not, the chariots pivoted and used missile fire at the infantry. Horses don't run into things willingly. 2) The troops under Alexander's Personal Command were Cavalry. Not the Phalanx. 3) The Phalanx can't open ranks like that. Chariots don't need to pivot to attack if they were inside the phalanx, they shoot sideways or out the rear, not over their own horses. 4) The Chariots can hit things fine when in motion, its what they train for. In the battle though, Alexander let them pass and rode on, so losses would be minimal. Here is the actual WIKI quote from the Guagamela Entry Attack of the Persian Scythed chariots 

I saw a television show "The Naked Archaeologist" that had on the show a large (several foot square) slab of glass in Israel with some graves around it. The slab was intended for the Temple in Jerusalem but never left for some reason, and later rabbis liked to be buried near it after the fall of the Temple to partake in its leftover spiritual closeness to said temple. This takes it to around 70 AD or earlier in Israel. I'm not sure if they have an exact date for the slab itself. Looking at the list of shows, it is probably Season 3, Ep 2 "Ancient Glass". 

I'd say your question itself gives the likely answer. Absent some written source explaining what happened, it is more or less a question of which is more likely: That in a sparsely populated world, that the proto-Indos did which one of: 

The Seven Hills of Rome is something of a misnomer, as three of them (Quirinal, Esquiline, and Viminal) are all protruding parts of one landmass. As in the Legendary Seven Kings of Rome, the attraction to seven is probably just that seven is a lucky number. Once you make the "Seven Hills" famous, it is pretty easy to pick out seven lumps in your city to make the allusion. Note that in Constantinople (Istanbul) three of the seven hills are one large hill (4, 5, 6) and three are outside the walls that Constantine founded the city on! (5, 6, 7). With this freedom of definition of what a hill is, many cities can and do find seven hills. My hometown, Cincinnati Ohio, did this too. 

In Viktor Suvarov's book, The Liberators, he frames a story where he and other officer cadets are discussing Communism while cleaning out a high ranking Party man's cesspool. He frames it by saying at each party convention they promise that "True Communism is 20 years away"...every year, always 20 years ahead. His final line in that story is that in the following year's party convention they promised...nothing at all. This chapter was framed about events in the mid 1960s. So they did decide to forget about the promises of future equality, if not saying that the present was great. 

The Russian Civil War (1917-23) and the Chinese Civil War (1930s-1949) have it beaten handily. It remains the bloodiest war in American History, partly because both sides were Americans. 

The quick answer is that they did get tired. If they wanted to rest, the two sides would recoil back and stop fighting for a time. One of the advantages of Roman discipline and tactics was they could rotate in new troops and take advantage of the exhausted men on the other side. 

The main issue with sustaining a 'line' is that without modern medicine, a decent fraction of marriages will not result in children. This ends that gens right there. If you have children, they may die before reaching the age to marry. In ancient times, child mortality was high, something in the 30-50 percent range. Wealthy families might do a little better, but not a lot. Having a taste for large families helps the odds. However, rich Romans in the Republic usually restricted themselves to 1 or 2 sons, in order to not divide the estate so the son could have enough wealth for politics. This put their gens in the "risky" category. An added risk for powerful, influential families was proscriptions and political murder during the Civil Wars and Imperial age under paranoid emperors. Entire families could and were wiped out that way. Roman families didn't last long. The Julius Caesares died with Caesar. His adopted nephew's line ended with him. The last known person with even a remote link to Augustus by blood was the Emperor Nero. 

Less than you think, because each man would have to kill his horse at about the same time. Then given spoilage, most of it would be lost. There isn't time or room or materials for every man to cure his horsemeat for sausages and the like 

One difference gunboat guns had during Shiloh is that they had to fire high to pass over the bluff and thus were not restricted to line-of-sight. This indirect fire meant nobody was safe from them, but the casualties due to gunboats was correspondingly low. They did conspire to make the area so uncomfortable that the Confederates retired a mile or more to get out of the zone. This helped with the Union counterattack as they could deploy without serious resistance. 

I'd say by the ancient people's idea the pointed base was a feature, not a bug. The smallish size made it easier to handle than a barrel, and it would always be risky to stack fragile clay vessels in large piles without support in any shape. Ships then were smaller and had less cargo volume so huge stacks of barrel-like containers wouldn't fit. 

No, they are not the same. Feudalism describes a kind of relation of lords to kings, Serfdom a relation of the tillers of the land to their lords. Consult a dictionary. 

Another issue was that the China War was run by the Japanese Army. The war against America was run by the Japanese Navy. These two groups did not cooperate much if at all with each other during the war. Source: Wikipedia on "Interservice Rivalries". Virtually any history of the development of the IJN will also give some information 

The most likely Plan B would have been to amp up Operation Anvil/Dragoon, the invasion of the south of France, possibly moving it forward from its actual date of August 15, 1944. With a lodgement made there, a subsequent cross channel invasion could be tried as soon as feasible. 

The major difference between the American Civil War and earlier is that it was the first war where the full industrial might of a major nation was applied to a large war - here split between the two sides. The application of these technologies allowed the US to sustain large armies over even larger areas to force the South to admit that their goals were not achievable and give up the fight. For this, the details of if they did a good job in exploiting a particular technology don't matter a lot, nor do the details of tactics, except that ineffective tactics make the job harder. But without the ability to move the men and supply them across the land, none of the rest matter much. 

Since Christianity believes that Christ is the Messiah that completes the Jewish prophecy, they also view the entire corpus of Old Testament history as part of Christian history - which is why it makes up half the Bible. As a major construction in the past built to specifications given by God, Solomon's temple is thus of historical interest to Christians. Building a duplicate might be extreme, but it isn't strange that a Christian sect would look back on Old Testament events like Moses, the Ark, or Solomon.
