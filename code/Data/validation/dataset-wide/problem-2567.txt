Thus this is not a correct way to phase the question. I noticed "mind" is used widely in English discussion on Buddhism. This seems a confusing translation that often "mind" being viewed as the ultimate essence. Therefore, we have the term "mindfulness" to be praised and worked hard on. This is not, although I'm also in the process of learning can't be sure if I'm correct, as much as I've understood and learnt. 

It's not really the big deal, or the main issue. The issue is antibacterial soap won't help in eliminating contamination, or benefit health (consider notion b). because the bacterial will evolve and become anti-antibacterial, we see this in medical reports. Likely antibacterial soap is also a marketing gimmick too, like toothpaste for man, toothpaste for woman, for kids, baby girls... etc. If one wants to be healthy and not infected, it's not to use antibacterial soap, it's to build up one's physical strength, health condition, becomes immune to any disease or infections. During the Black Death, many died, but some survive, why? During SARS, a patch died, but some were immune instead some even carriers of the virus, why? Buddha has the answer but it would be too off (too advance?) for modern men they can only label it: superstitions. 

Example, Mahisasakas Pratimoksa (survived only in the Chinese Canon) recorded an event, Buddha and his Bhiksus were invited by a famous courtesan to her manor for the meal. When setting out, Buddha reminded the Bhiksus, "繫念在前" (reined in and fasten the mind to present, or be mindful), because they were about to enter into a house of great temptation. In this event, the mindfulness, contrast to the marketers' advice, doesn't have an object to be mindful of. Another example, also in the Chinese Vinaya collection, recorded when Devadatta stolen 500 Bhiksus from the Buddha to set up his own Saṃgha, Sariputra and Maudgalyāyana sent by the Buddha visiting him. Devadatta, thinking they were coming to join him, mimicking the Buddha, ordered Sari. to deliver the teaching while Maud. do the Rddhi show, said his back was kind of aching (like the Buddha's back), then laid down on his right for a rest (also like the Buddha did). However, he forgot to "繫念在前" (be mindful) (the Buddha always did) soon fell asleep, snoring noisily and drooling, when the two led away the 500 Bhiksus. Here again, there would not be any object to be mindful of if Devadetta really practiced mindfulness to prevent fallen asleep. According to records in Chinese Canon, if mindfulness - 繫念 practiced correctly, one will easily be a genius, from simply having photographic memory, to preforming psychokinesis. 

It's dangerous and the beginning of suffering when our mind and our intellect goes in split, our prime evil in the 12 Nidanas begin with Ignorance. That's why when our intellect knew reality is mind created, but our mind can't see the real reality. Thus the rest of your analogies in your questions are the declarations of the intellect, but the mind doesn't agree to see the same. So they are fallacies, but correct in terms of clauses written on the human laws books. Your teacher taught a very dangerous teaching. The battle between Emptiness空 and Beingness有 was quite bloody in the history of Tibetan Buddhism. Some Bhikkhus committed gravely sins when caught up by the notion of Emptiness, with only their intellectual understanding. If we need to eat "food" to survive or not for reality is mind created. In fact, what do you think that is "food"? When broken down into smaller and smaller units, food is just energy. A grain of rice is full of carbon, so is charcoal, diamond, but you can't eat diamond can you? The Buddha said all are combinations of the 4 Greats (attributions): fire water earth wind, plus 3 more totaled 7 Greats but they are not directly involved in forming "matter". In real there are no such things as apple, potato, cabbage... etc. If your mind and intellect are "coherent", yes, eating is no longer corresponding to human food only. In Chinese self-cultivation practice 辟谷, abstain of human food, is a very common practice. This is also likely known in traditional Indian yogis. Practicing meditation there are ways to intake energy directly from the surrounding. In fact, to a deeper level, this intake-release of energy is also an illusion. However, if your mind can't directly see the illusion, only your intellect is babbling, this won't have any effect on actual feeling the hunger, and eventual starve to death. :\ 

Called Catuṣkoṭi, I prefer the name "Four-statements". Not a fifth statement can be procured by the intellect, except combining the four to make sub-sets. A question asked from these Four-statements answered in the Four-statements, Buddha called it "game of the mind" (戲論). There are plenty of these examples in general teachings recorded in Agama Sutras; sophisticated examples in advance teachings recorded in such as Avatamsaka Sutra (the first Sutra spoken by the Buddha). For instant, if this same type of question asked by a Christian: Who created the world? Ans: God. Who created God? Ans (maybe:)): God's father. Who created God's father? Ans: God's grandfather... finally, one can only come up this answer to halt the question: God is Alpha and Omega (the beginning and end/no beginning and end). See? How horrible the mind can elicit gaming! But, The Truth is beyond these Four-statements; beyond intellect, beyond the mind; can be pointed, yet not caged for display, like the finger pointing to the moon. That's the deepest teaching of the Buddha. Nagarjuna elaborated the teaching profoundly, for easy application, used one word: Emptiness (空). OK. I'm diving a bit too much into the sea, giving too long an answer, a bit scary too, huh? Better is finding out by yourself :) 

This phrase is a bit strange. Buddhism has many branches, the methods could be varied. It's true and false. loosely saying, I think when practicing for the Pureland at the verge of dying, yes; or Tibetan during the Guru-yoga, yes. Ch'an, probably, no. And there is record about Ananda not succeeded after years attending at the side of the Buddha, finally he realized that even the Buddha was his cousin/brother(?) the Buddha wouldn't be able to give his achievement to Ananda, he must learn by himself and arrive by himself. To conclude, a skeptical mind and discerning align with the teaching. However, an open mind is the key to the gate for knowledge beyond what science proclaimed. Science keeps refuting itself and it's own discovery, that means science not the ultimate truth. 

I try for a short hint, your demand is high for you're asking the "experience"! If the practitioner experienced authentic, discretionary, either Anatta even Sunyata, we have likely an Arhat walking among us! Anatta is for the Self, I, the subject of experience, Sunyata is for the world, the phenomena, the object to be experienced. Realization of Sunyata can only happened after Anatta. Realization of Anatta, one is indestructible, physically and mentally; realization of Sunyata, one is able to change the phenomenal world; either realization of Anatta or Sunyata, one can be invisible if wished ;). Sunyata intrinsically implied Anatta, I wonder what your referred regarding non-conforming? It is not the practitioner chose the ideal, it has to follow the procedure, like one must 1st break down the wall, then to tackle for all-encompassing visual field. 

The question you asked is the result of modern compartmental education, it is a hindrance to The Path. 

Because Buddha knows that there are ready students for the Mahayana; same as there are ready students for the Theravada; same for Hinayana. As A BUDDHA, HE is able to teach any truth/doctrine. The Four Noble Truths is one of the fundamental teachings in Mahayana, it's not exclusive for Theravada only. If you read the Lotus Sutra (translated by Kumarajiva into Chinese), a chapter told that this Lotus Sutra was taught in the previous-previous sermon by the previous-previous Buddha. Buddha Prabhutaratna (many-treasures), the Buddha who had entered Nirvana eons of kalpas ago, appeared, and sat together with Buddha Shakyamuni inside the Prabhutaratna Stupa for this sermon of the Lotus Sutra... Another chapter used a metaphor, to "lure" the sons leaving the burning house, the rich father said there were vehicles adorned with treasures drawn by cows, deers and etc waiting at the entrance. In fact, the father would like to give all the sons the great vehicles with most of the treasures because he was very very rich and loving. Since all beings are the buddha-to-be; and was in essence a buddha, thus maybe you would give teaching in the time-to-be, it would be the same truth but told in the way that dictated by your audiences ;) 

The world is going to a point of no return, with the thirst for materialistic grandeur and power to rule over nature; after the conquered of Oriental by the Occidental. This article talks about Cyborg. Cyborg, Bionic Man, Clone, Trans-human... these could be the future of you and me, friends and colleagues walking on the streets. Or programmed, or with specific "functions", or one prototype of "human resources", it could all be tailor-made. When human falls into such situation, are Buddhist self-cultivation practices such as meditation, mantra chanting, concentration of mind... etc still viable; can enlightenment still be reachable for these types of humans? Explanation Added: Especially for certain schools of practices, it's about the Wind (氣), Nadi (脈), Bindu (明點) related to the human body, e.g., the Tibetan School. Certain other schools, included is the Hinayana, that the practice of the White Skeleton Visualization is depended upon working on the body to transform the consciousness - can a "Re-made Human" (Cyborg, Trans-human who has his body parts enhanced, replaced by organic or inorganic components, partially human partially machine, with devices implanted to achieve certain supernatural abilities such as remote viewing, mind control with micro-wave... all could be imagined... in short, Iron Man or Wolverine type of human) do the Buddhist practices and achieve enlightenment? Remarks Added 14/02/2017 Excerpt from MarketWatch: 

This is not a black and white simple answer... however, to give you ideas, for the original sutras that have been translated into Chinese, the classical ones are the best, they were translated by great masters like Kumarajiva, Xuanzang... these masters they themselves had reached the high level of self-cultivation (Bodhisattvas, Arhats) and the translation was promoted and sponsored by the Chinese Emperors in Ancient China; great scholars would be gathered, discussed, debated, then concluded the translations. For example, Kumarajiva and Xuanzang were both fluent in Sanskrit and Chinese. However, these sutras are written in Classical Chinese 文言文, the complete collection Tripitaka in Traditional Chinese. However, Simplified Chinese is used in Mainland China by 11bn people since 1950s/1960s, and the Putonghua with Pinyin is very easy to learn for Westerners. There are brilliant practitioners in Mainland China and many of the treasures are inherited in the Mainland simply they are there. But Taiwan has strong roots in Buddhism since it's never truncated by any turmoils or Cultural Revolutions they used the Traditional Chinese. If you intend to read by the Modern Chinese you could find 南懷瑾 老師 Teacher Nan Huai-Chin, he is in this time one of the few most learnt and bright teachers resided in Taiwan but he really learnt all his knowledge when he was still in China. (Passed away.) A website has almost all his works: 实修驿站 (shixiu.net) in Simplified. Another is the Tibetan Rinpoche 慈誠羅珠. If you are trying to buy books with translated sutra from Classical Chinese 文言文 to Modern Chinese 白話文 you have to be very very careful. These modern translations maybe erroneous or partially grasped the original meanings; Chinese language is a very graphical and refined language the meanings are not on the faces of the words, literally speaking. This is in particular for the Zen Buddhism. There is a famous Buddhist metaphor, that is "the finger pointing to the moon", if one watches the finger, one will fail to see the moon.
