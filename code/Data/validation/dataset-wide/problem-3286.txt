The most recent paper that I am aware of that challenges the traditionally accepted date was published in 2007, and boasts the rather catchy-title, The 79 AD eruption of Somma: The relationship between the date of the eruption and the southeast tephra dispersion by Rolandi et al. This pulls together several strands of evidence - including the coin that you mentioned (which records the fifteenth imperial acclamation of the emperor Titus) - to argue for a later date in the Autumn of 79 AD. 

Columbus’s first voyage across the Atlantic to the New World in 1492 took more than two months. Crossing times did improve over time, but by the 1700s, sailing ships still needed six weeks or more to make the crossing. Making an allowance for the overland transport of messages, it would be reasonable to estimate that mail would take at least 8 weeks / 2 months to travel from Madrid to Mexico. However, we should also remember that through the age of sail, crossing times would also have been greatly effected by the weather, so an estimate of two months would still only be an average. As noted in this article, 

Nevertheless, the historian A.H.N. Jones is quoted in Brent Kinman's Jesus' Entry Into Jerusalem as follows: 

You are right that the title "Pharaoh" () is first used in the New Kingdom. Specifically, the first recorded use of the title is in the reign of the 18th Dynasty ruler, Thuthmosis III. The more generally used word for "King" was nswt (, often abbreviated to ). This is most commonly encountered on offering stella, where the standard offering formula begins: 

It seems that the intention had been to build Fat Man devices for the planned subsequent missions even before the first Trinity test on 16 July 1945. 

The author quotes elsewhere from Goodlake's personal correspondence, which may have been the source of this story. 

Actually, we know from recent research that the American, William Wadsworth, was captain of the Il'mena from 1813 to at least 1819. The Chief Administrator of the Russian-American Company, Alexander Andreevich Baranov, hired Wadsworth to captain the Il’mena on her first voyage on behalf of the Company. The ship left Sitka, Alaska in either December 1813 (according to Khlenikov) or January 1814 (according to Ogden). A letter dated 15 July 1818 from I.A. Kuskov to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Colonies in America makes it clear that Wadsworth was still in command of the Il’mena at that time. Since the events in question occurred in May 1816, it seems that Wadsworth must still have been captain of the Il’mena when it arrived at Oahu. Indeed, Bolkhovitinov explicitly states that Wadsworth was captain, and that he was ordered to remain in Hawaii by Schäffer. 

So what about the value of the ushabtiu? For the owner of the tomb, the ushabtiu were expected to carry out the onerous duties in the afterlife that they did not want to do themselves. In earlier periods where ushabtiu were provided with tiny tools etc. with which to complete their tasks, it seems that the roles of the ushabtiu servants in the afterlife may have been specific to each shabti figure. Otherwise, the ushabtiu seem to have been intended as generic servants. Here, the "value" of the ushabtiu was that they would relieve the tomb owner of the need to work in the afterlife, and the uniqueness probably wasn't a significant factor (except, perhaps, for the early ushabtiu). One might argue that the ushabtiu figures also had a "value" for the wider society if they replaced the requirement for the sacrificial burial of servants with the deceased (something for which we do have some limited evidence from the pre-dynastic and early-dynastic periods). For Egyptologists, the "value" of ushabtiu figures lies in the information that can be extracted about ancient beliefs, manufacturing techniques and technologies, fashions, etc. Here, the uniqueness is obviously a factor and we might expect to learn more from ushabtiu with unique characteristics than we would from mass-produced ushabtiu. Clearly, Ushabtiu figures also have a "value" to modern collectors of antiquities. The use of the phrase "valued and popular" in the question may suggest that this is the "value" of interest. For modern collectors, there are only a limited number of ushabtiu figures legally available to purchase on the antiquities market (even on sites like eBay), and many of those are probably fakes. Even though ushabtiu were produced in enormous numbers in Ancient Egypt, the vast majority of these are now held in museum collections around the world. The fact that they are anthropomorphic and that they were so ubiquitous makes them popular. They are a very human link with the past. Their antiquity, and the limited supply makes them valuable. The more unique the figure (e.g. the early figures with tiny tools to help them perform their role), the more we can identify with the individual that it was intended to represent, and so the more popular it becomes. These ushabtiu are much more rare, and - as one might expect from the laws of supply and demand - consequently more valuable to collectors. 

As you mentioned in the question, we know that Tiglath-pileser III was a general named Pulu before he became ruler. We also know that he seems previously to have been the governor of Kalhu/Nimrud [Healey, 2000]. Beyond that, we really know nothing of his origins. However, the fact that he and his sons took different throne names doesn't actually support the idea that they were foreign usurpers. His assumed name, Tiglath Pileser III, is actually the Hebrew version of the Akkadian Tukulti-Apil-Esara. This was clearly a name chosen to link himself directly to great kings of the past, presumably as a means of legitimising his position. His son and successor Shalmaneser V was previously known as Ululayu, but this simply means "born in Elul" - Elul being the 6th month of the Assyrian calendar. His throne-name, Shalmaneser, meant "the god Salmanu is foremost", and once again provided him with a link with distinguished predecessors. Shalmaneser V was succeeded by his brother, Sargon II. We actually don't know what name he was known by before he assumed his throne-name (which meant "the king is true"). As governor of Kalhu/Nimrud, it seems unlikely that Tiglath Pileser III would have been a foreigner. The usual assumption these days seems to be that he was a usurper, probably of royal blood, who took the Assyrian crown by force after engineering a coup against his ineffective predecessor. There is no suggestion, however, that he was a foreign usurper. However, as I said right at the start, we really don't have the evidence to be at all certain. 

For Britain's Caribbean colonies, it used to be believed that most freed slaves adopted or were given the surname of their owner. However, more recent research shows that, although this did happen, there were other options available to free men and women. Guy Grannum, in his book Tracing Your Caribbean Ancestors lists the following sources for the origin of surnames: 

Interestingly, people often point to the fact that the 1945 Labour government was a "socialist" government as a reason that the Marshall Aid was "wasted". That government certainly implemented large-scale social reforms. However, the foundations of those reforms had been laid by the wartime coalition government. As mentioned above, the reforms promised by both the main parties during the 1945 election actually look surprisingly similar (although the reforms actually enacted by the Labour government certainly went further than those that had been promised by the Conservatives). The challenges imposed by Britain's perceived global position would have been the same, no matter who was in power. The same is true of the global political situation and Britain's economic position.
