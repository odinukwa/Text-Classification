Ethnologue actually provides an answer to this question, although it raises more questions. The Ethnologue page How many languages in the world are unwritten says that as of the 19th edition (released 2016), there were 7,097 living languages and that of these there is data suggesting that 3,748 have a 'developed writing system'. This leaves 3,349 that are 'likely unwritten'. No explanation is given as to what is meant by a 'developed writing system' however we can make an informed guess that it refers to a writing system that has been developed in order to be of practical use to the speakers. This would typically rule out writing systems used in technical descriptive works (eg by linguists). It is also commonplace that such writing systems have been developed with the involvement of speakers of the language, quite possibly without a linguist or any other outsiders being involved. Ethnologue goes on to say that in most cases it is not known what level of usage these writing systems have. 

Yes, it is possible to analyse Maori grammar without finding a straightforward contrast between 'noun' and 'verb', at least at the highest level of categorisation. Many Maori words may occur in a variety of syntactic environments, somewhat like English zero-derivation (eg, 'fish' can be noun or verb-or perhaps there's two words 'fish', one verb and one noun, but they have identical form?) but much more pervasive. As a result, there have been serious analyses that don't employ the usual noun-verb categtorisation. Bruce Biggs (1996) analysed Maori as having two major categories, 'bases' and 'particles', with five subcategories of 'base'. According to Biggs, Particles are words that occur on the peripheries of phrases and perform functions such as case marking, TAM, directionality, deixis, etc. Bases are those words that can occur as phrasal head and provide the lexical content. He divides 'base' into these five subcategories: Noun: can take definite article but can't occur as head of verb phrase. Universal: a word that may be passivised. Stative: a base that can be head of a verb phrase, but not passivised. Locative: a base that can be directly preceded by the locative preposition. Personal: a base that takes the personal article. So while 'nouns' and 'verbs' are grouped together at the highest level of categorisation, they are distinguished as subcategories (with verbs broken into two subcategories). A more recent attempt to classify Maori word classes is that of Winifred Bauer, in The Reed Reference Grammar of Maori. She takes a very different approach to Biggs, although starting from the same issue that 'Maori, like other Polynesian languages, uses the same form of a word in many different syntactic environments' (p. 65). Her analysis identifies classes of noun and verb (along with others) but she argues that morphosyntactic distributional criteria are not enough to identify all and only the members of each category and that the way forms contribute to the organisation of syntactic structure in the clause is also relevant. 

A diphthong is a single vowel sound which is not a single 'pure' vowel quality, but is composed of a transition from one vowel target to another. Some examples (using RP English) are the vowel sounds in the following: lied [laɪ̯d] low [ləʊ̯w] A digraph is a combination of two graphemes to represent a single sound. Thus the digraph is composed of two graphemes, and , but as it represents a distinct sound, the labiodental fricative [f]. Digraphs may be used to represent diphthongs. 

Firstly, the writing system has little relevance to this question but I'll point out that while Old English was originally written in runes, from the 9th Century on the Latin Alphabet was used although with a few characters no longer included (e.g. þ 'thorn', ð 'eth' and ƿ 'wynn'). Old English refers to the language ancestral to Modern English that was spoken in much of England from the 5th C. until the 12th C. We know it was ancestral because we have detailed knowledge of the course of development from Old English, through Middle English up to Modern English. This knowledge includes huge numbers of etymologies as well as a detailed understanding of changes in the grammar. The sequences of changes that led from Old English grammatical structure to that of Modern English is well understood, and is exemplified at many points in time by numerous pieces of writing (scribal, ecclesiastical and personal). It is that substantial evidence of Old English as the ancestor to Modern English that allows us to identify Old English as 'English'. In fact, it was King Alfred the Great who, in the 9th Century, referred to Old English by the name 'English'. So Old English is identifiable as English both because it was the first variety given this name, and because it is demonstrably the ancestor of Modern English. Historical linguistics is 'diachronic', meaning it examines changes in a language over time. The divisions into 'languages' and 'dialects' is usually applied synchronically (ie at a given point in time). The usual definition is that spoken varieties are different languages if they are not mutually intelligible, and are dialects of the one language if they are. By this definition Old English and Modern English are different languages. Linguists have tried to work out how long it takes for a language to change so much that it would no longer be intelligible to the earlier speakers, but it's highly speculative. To answer your second question then, a language is separated from other languages by sufficient differences in lexicon and grammar such that the two languages are not mutually intelligible. 

You could use concordance software to do this. It will generate a concordance of your text which will show (amongst other things) how often each word occurs. If you use a KWIC (key word in context) concordancer it will also show the immediate context within which each word occurs. As an example, here's a concordancer for Macintosh OS X computers, CasualConc 

Although not shown in the graphic there are two IE languages spoken in Burma's Rakine State, Chakma and Rohingya, but these do not extend as far east as Assamese. The westernmost IE language is Icelandic, extending up to 24º W. If Iceland were excluded due to being a relatively 'recent' settlement (~847 CE) then the westernmost IE language is Gaeilge, the Celtic language of Ireland, at 10.5º W, just marginally further west than Portuguese. 

The term 'native speaker' usually refers to someone who has the language in question as their mother tongue, i.e. it is their first language, acquired as an infant (of course, someone may have multiple mother tongues and so be a native speaker of multiple languages). So under that definition it is not possible to become a 'native speaker' of a language later in life, after acquiring a different language as a mother tongue. However it is possible to reach a native speaker level of fluency in a language which is not one's mother tongue, and this is how the highest level of skill in a language is commonly described in linguistics. So looked at this way it is possible to become a 'native speaker', at least functionally. Some individuals seem able to acquire a high level of skill in a new language with seeming ease. These individuals are sometimes referred to as 'rapid language learners'. A famous example in the world of linguistics is the late Ken Hale. 

There isn't much information on the language referred to by the OP as "Fifa'a", but there is some information on a group of people in Saudi Arabia called the Fayfa. The Fayfa are described in this evangelical religious website as speaking Mehri. Additionally, the Missionary Atlas Project lists the "Fayfa" people and also describes them as speaking Mehri. This makes it likely that this is the language the OP (based on his informant) refers to as "Fifa'a" so I proceed on this assumption. The Fayfa people of Saudia Arabia speak Mehri, a Yemeni language classified as a member of the South Arabian subgroup of the South Semitic group of languages (within the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family). The Arabic languages (which includes Saudi Arabic), on the other hand, are classified within the Central Semitic group (etc) so are quite distantly related to Mehri. This means that Arabic and Fayfa are definitely not mutually intelligible and can therefore be described as distinct languages. The majority of Mehri speakers are in Yemen, but there are also a number in Oman. There is a modest body of work on Mehri, some of which is listed at OLAC. 

In attempting to answer this question I think it's useful to distinguish between the terms 'mood' and 'modality': 

A useful set of conventions for constructing interlinear glosses are Christian Lehmann's rules for interlinear morphemic glosses. 

The Bakker article seems to be hard to obtain. Further reading may be found in the bibliography of the subject Bernard Comrie posted to LinguistList in 1998. 

It's been claimed that Margi (Chadic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, Nigeria) has only two vowels, /ɨ/ and /a/. There have also been sporadic claims of other languages with small or anomalous vowel systems, for example Iatmul (Ndu language family, Papua New Guinea) has been described variously as having: one (/a/), two (/ə/ and /a/), three (/ɨ/, /ə/ and /a/), seven and twelve vowel phonemes. So by at least some analyses Iatmul has no /i/ phoneme. So the answer may depend on how flexible /i/ and /a/ are allowed to be. It may be better to recast the question in terms of features, front/central/back and high/mid/low and ask if there are languages with no (e.g.) high vowels, no low vowels, only mid vowels, etc. 

Research in linguistics has shown that when English-speaking children are asked to pluralise made-up words (which fit with the phonotactic constraints of English) they use the standard productive plurals, suffixing: 

On the basis of these figures it appears that Murrinhpatha currently is the non-Pama-Nyungan language with the largest number of speakers. Of course, the Indigenous Australian languages with the largest numbers of speakers are the creoles, Kriol (Kimberley and Arnhem Land regions) and Yumplatok (Torres Strait islands and Cape York peninsula). While these are not Pama-Nyungan, they are also conventionally not included in non-Pama-Nyungan. 

The Georgian verb has a complex templatic structure which includes a slot that may optionally be occupied by one of a set of morphemes known (within Kartvelian studies) as "versions". These "versions" consist of a single vowel and serve primarily to indicate valence or grammatical voice. Their precise function and syntactic scope results from their interaction with the larger syntactic and semantic context within which they are used. On many verbs the version morphemes are merely agreement markers. In some cases their effect is lexically specific (ie idiosyncratic to that verb). It should be noted that other parts of the Georgian verb may also affect verb valency. These "version" morphemes are found, in very similar form, in other languages of the Kartvelian family. Similar morphology, also described as version systems, is also found in some Turkic languages of Siberia, in the isolate Burushaski, and in South Munda Gorum, an Austroasiatic language of India; these systems are functionally similar to version but formally very different. It has been suggested that the focus systems of Austronesian languages, and the viewpoint aspect systems found in some Trans-New Guinea languages have similar functions to version. While the term "version" originated in Kartvelian studies (being a translation of the Georgian term kceva, lit. `change') some authors are using it to describe similar systems occuring in other languages. The structure and functions of the Georgian "versions" are described in "Steal Me an Apple: Version in Georgian". The PhD thesis by Tuite, (1998) "Kartvelian Morphosyntax" provides a description of versions (amongst many other things) across the Kartvelian languages generally. 

Sounds made using the tongue and lip/s are usually called "linguolabials" (eg in the IPA). There are a very few languages which make use of this sound as a phoneme, some examples are listed in the Wikipedia article on linguolabials. The article lists Coatlán Zapotec as having a linguolabial trill, but it appears to be iconic, used to represent a child's fart, not an actual phoneme. There appear to be no reports of languages that use a linguolabial trill as a phoneme. Edward Vajda claims that the Chadic language Margi (spoken in Nigeria) has an "apico-labial flap", but this is not in agreement with other analyses of Margi (it may be that he meant to refer to the well-known labiodental flap of Margi). 

It seems that under normal circumstances English speakers would apply this rule to novel words, but whoever makes up the word can make up the plural as well. An example of this is the semi-jocular plurals of 'Unix' as 'Unices' and 'Unixen', instead of the predicted 'Unixes' /ˈjunɪksəz/. For the example you give, 'koopa', the expected plural form would be 'koopas', pronounced something like /kupəz/. 

There are a number of examples known of tonal systems being lost in daughter languages, a couple are described below. Given that it is thought that the majority of the world's languages make use of some kind of tonal contrast in their phonology, that tone seems to be a feature likely to be conserved diachronically, and that tonogenesis seems to happen fairly readily, we shouldn't expect there to be many examples of the loss of tone. According to Downing (2004) proto-Bantu is reconstructed as having had two tones. While most present-day Bantu languages have tonal contrasts a few have lost them, retaining only a stress system, eg Chimwi:ni, Kituba, Nyakyusa and Swahili. It has been argued by Indo-Europeanist scholars (including Christian Lehmann) that an early stage of proto-Indo-European had a pitch-accent system which was lost in most daughter branches. It was preserved into Ancient Greek (although lost in Modern Greek) and continues in present-day Lithuanian and some Slavic languages. The tone systems found in some North Germanic languages are thought to be relatively recent innovations. 

Blevins (2004) suggests that this is probably due to a combination of factors, including a fixed verb-pronoun word order and the phonological form of verbs causing sandhi changes on following pronouns. (Blevins, J. 2004. 'Evolutionary Phonology'. CUP.) Iai (Austronesian family, New Caledonia) also has tensed pronouns, but this is reported to be similar to the English pronouns with (what has been called) propositional marking of tense: "I'll, I'd, I'm, I". Scottish Gaelic has two forms of the 2sg pronoun, /tu/ and /thu/, the former occurring only with future/present habitual verbs. Similar to the situation with Gurnu, these have arisen through phonological change caused by the adjacent verb, Gaelic having VSO order in the clause. Hausa (Afro-Asiatic family) and Wolof (Niger-Congo family) also have distinct sets of pronouns for indicating different tense/mood. These are sometimes known as 'temporal pronouns'. Upriver Halkomelem (Salishan family) has tense marking on nouns and pronouns. On a slightly different tack, it has been shown that two tense-marking auxiliaries in Panare (Cariban family) derive etymologically from demonstrative pronouns. (Gildea, S. 1993. 'The development of tense markers from demonstrative pronouns in Panare (Cariban)'. Studies in Language, 17:1) 

This can be difficult to pin down. Demonstratives are typically used to pick something out by their location in space (or time) relative to the position of the speaker (deixis). Definite articles function as a referent-tracking device, and pick something out as having already been mentioned, or already known about. To diagnose forms as demonstratives and/or definite articles we have to study recorded utterances, along with their context, and work out how the forms in question are being used. Some languages have distinct demonstratives and definite articles, some have one set of forms that covers both functions.
