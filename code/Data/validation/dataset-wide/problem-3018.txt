Let me preface this by saying that I am not at all a Spinoza scholar, and stand to be corrected on this. My reading is that existence is certainly a power, so that the first Axiom means (or implies) that all existent things either exist by virtue of themselves (i.e., are self-caused primitives) or by virtue of another (where "exist by virtue of" can be read as "draw their power of existence from"). This is a fairly standard place for philosophical texts to begin; about 1500 years before Spinoza, and a continent away, Nāgārjuna began his Mūlamadhyamakakārikā with the verse: "Neither from itself, nor from another, nor from both, nor without a cause, does anything whatever, anywhere arise." Among the views he was rejecting in that list is Spinoza's axiom, which was already considered classical in 2nd century India. 

A good starting point for your research would be the SEP Article on the subject. I don't think any of us will be able to condense it down much more than that. 

First of all: this is an excellent question, and deserves a better response than I can give it. I'm far from an expert in Nyingma Buddhism-- among Tibetan traditions, I'm much better read in Gelug texts-- but I'll give it a shot. The theory of mind that you refer to, that one's thoughts are inaccessible to others, is a mainstay in Western philosophy. A classic explication can be found in Wittgenstein's Beetle Box experiment, and Jacques Derrida (following Levinas's reading of Husserl) has attempted to investigate the ethical implications of the fact that Tout autre est tout autre. In early Buddhism, the primary soteriological project (and thus Buddhism's raison d'etre) consists largely of the deconstruction of the traditional notion of "self", and the theories of mind proposed are largely subsumed to that project. The "self" is viewed as a collection of five skandhas (heaps, aggregates): form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. The relationship between these (and the definition of each term) varies across a number of competing interpretations, but the key factor for our purposes is that each of the above is plural, and represents a flow of discrete events. In Tibetan Buddhism, this is often conceptualized as a "mind-stream", which is made up of a series of discrete mental events, each of which is linked to the preceding (and succeeding) events (giving the illusion of continuity) by a process of dependent origination. (The fact that a mental event is necessarily caused by a preceding mental event is traditionally given as a proof of rebirth, at least in the Gelug school.) For our purposes, it is important to note that these mental events are necessarily internal: there is no way for someone else to perceive (through ordinary sense perception) these events. I suppose I should underline that parenthetical qualification; the omniscience of Buddhas (while dwelling in meditative equipoise) is taken as given (and Śāntarakṣita argues this point at length; see Sara McClintock's book on the subject)-- but I assume we are excluding Buddhas here, on practical grounds, at least-- the next Buddha is not expected to arrive in this universe for several billion years, so we can safely table the issue, I think. Anyway, to return to the matter at hand: the question referred specifically to the Nyingma school, and here we must add some nuance. We have discussed the fact that the "opacity of mind" is near-ubiquitous in both Western philosophy and the Buddhist tradition writ large-- but Nyingma Buddhism is characterized by its (unique) notion of Dzogchen, which is often translated as "radiant mind", and this practice (and the corresponding philosophical interpretations) is the matter of some debate. Nyingmapas (and some Gelugpas) argue that Dzogchen is fully compatible with the Madhyamaka notion of Śūnyatā (Emptiness), but some Gelugpas argue the contrary-- that Dzogchen represents a form of philosophical backsliding which (like some forms of Yogācāra, according to this interpretation) tends toward hypostatization of Mind which opens the way to a reintroduction of Ātman through the back door. So, to summarize: the "opacity of mind" is not a specifically Nyingma position within Buddhism; in fact, the Nyingma school offers perhaps the best standpoint for an argument against it, if one wished to go down that road (which Buddhists generally don't.) 

No, the other way around. Slave morality, Nietzsche argues, was foisted on the masters by the slaves, in order to keep them in state of submissiveness, and that's what Nietzsche finds so wrong; the strong-willed are absent, or in hiding, and need to awaken and seize back what should be theirs. (And that's more than a bit reductionist, as one would expect of a brief answer here.) To summarize: if you're interested in Nietzsche on slave morality, read some Nietzsche, or some of the (voluminous) secondary literature on Nietzsche; Wikipedia is barely a start. 

They are not abstract products, as we have seen; they are actual. We can definitely stipulate a "posessor", and talk about which person (or corporate entity) "possesses" the phone at any point in time. 

Aquinas claims that "Things do not come into existence uncaused", but how does he know this to be true? Is there any rigorous way he can eliminate the possibility that every once in a very great while (perhaps just once, in fact), something did arise uncaused? Second: if he is willing to accept an uncaused God, is there any reason not to accept an uncaused universe? Or, contrariwise, if he is not willing to accept that the universe is uncaused, why does he accept that God is uncaused? (And, saying that the universe is created and God is not simply begs the question; there's no way for him to know that the universe is created or that God is uncreated.) Finally, Hawking hasn't proved anything-- he's merely hypothesized. 

I don't see how it is structurally different from any other self-referential paradox (such as the Liar), nor do I see how it offers any additional material for philosophical reflection. The statement reduces to "I think that I am smarter than I think I am", which appears to me to be structurally the same as "I speak the truth: I am lying." 

No, heapness is to be understood as something like "red" or "bald"; even in classical cases of the Sorites Paradox, the existence of the possibly-bald-man (or the would-be-heap) is not in doubt. 

The domain of Logic is usually considered to be philosophy; all science piggybacks upon the foundation of classical logic and inference. In this regard, we can say that all Science, therefore, relies on a body of prior philosophical discussion. 

Now, superficially, this appears to say absolutely nothing. There may be a philosophical thought lurking behind the surface here somewhere, but you're going to have to draw it out for us. If the question remains "What do you think of the view of consciousness stated in the quote above?" my answer is "Not much." EDIT: Since the question was reformulated a bit, I thought I would flesh out my answer in terms of the new portion, the question of how consciousness "pervades all of creation and stimulates the behavior of living beings." The short answer, for the vast majority of Western philosophers, is "it doesn't." All sentient beings, by definition, possess consciousness, but this does not mean that they all partake of (the same) consciousness, or that consciousness as such pervades all conscious beings. What's more, for many philosophers-- let's say Husserl, and those that follow him-- each individual consciousness is radically unknowable by any other consciousness. There is literally no way that anyone else can have direct access to my thoughts. Furthermore, for many philosophers-- let's say those influenced by Freud, to begin with-- no individual consciousness is completely transparent to itself. In other words, there is literally no way that I can be fully aware of the contents of my own consciousness. Finally, as to the question of how consciousness "stimulates the behavior of living beings"-- this is largely, but not universally, accepted; there are some who argue that consciousness is purely epiphenomenal, and has no causal role in behavior. 

The argument you quote is not a syllogism; it hinges upon an unstated proposition, which is the definition of the word "primitive." We'd need to supply this missing bit in order to turn it into a formal argument. Therefore, the determination of whether or not the derived argument is fallacious is going to depend on how we define the key term. One could claim that the so-called argument is clearly rhetorical and not logical, and that it therefore relies on an appeal to emotion-- but to do requires that one has already made a determination regarding what defines a "primitive" in this context. 

I've got half an answer for you. Many philosophers-- Ricouer and Derrida come immediately to mind-- talk about what you are calling "the dilution of meaning." It's not really a dilution, of course, but an expansion of meaning, as words are used in new and different contexts, and the meaning adapts accordingly. As such, no one (that I know of) speaks of "how to avoid it", as it is a necessary part of language. Rigor in language is always a matter of degree; one can attempt to create a formal language where every term is rigorously (and univocally) defined, but any such formal language will remain artificial, Leibniz's dreams notwithstanding.
