One possibility is that Kielder Forest Park covers quite a lot of the Scotland England border. This should provide enough wilderness for wild camping and exploration off the beaten track but is also close enough to the well established Berwick to Gretna trail that you have the option of a more 'civilised' route for some sections if you want. A more convoluted route could also take in sections of the Hadrian's Wall trail. As with much of scotland Kielder is horrific for midges at certain times of the year but its is very pleasant walking territory. A lot of it is forestry so tarps and hammocks should be viable although it does tend to be fairly dry conifer plantations so there may not be as much forage as in other parts of the country and, in my experience there water sources can be a bit sparse in some parts, especially in summer. In terms of self sufficiency there is also a difference between just challenging and remote terrain where you need to carry everything you need to live on your back and areas where you can take more of a bushcraft type approach and make use of natural resources. Clearly the caveat with the latter approach is that you need either adopt a zero impact approach or get the landowner's permission if you are going to do any harvesting, foraging, hunting or fishing (or have an established legal and ethical right to do so). 

Is there any method for making the initial stages of an abseil smoother when the anchor in use is at foot level and the ledge drops off abruptly. I have had a big swing before when trying to do this and found it quite unpleasant. 

I've seen people wear ponchos with a belt around the midriff, it looks cool. Ultimately it's probably not the best garment in high wind. You could try sewing in elastic draw cords. 

you have to drag out a load more rope, which will slow you down, wasting energy the rope may be running over/ in the way of your next hold extending your arm to its maximum length and doing work with it, is awkward/ uncomfortable you may not be in the best position for holding on with only one arm. in terms of balance, posture, wait on feet, quality of holds 

It depends : A ferrocerium rod will produce more, hotter, larger sparks than a traditional flint and steel and with care you can shave off a small pile of material from the rod without sparking it which can act as an igniter. Ideally you should carry a reasonable quantity of tinder with you in a waterproof container like a tobacco tin, this means that you will always have the means to reliably create a flame. This should be topped up as you go. Obviously once you have got a fire lit you have the means to dry more tinder to replenish what you have used. Indeed there was a time in teh not too distant past when tinder box was the normal way of making fire. A good weather resistant tinder is cotton wool impregnated with Vaseline, tampons are also good as they are very compact and are available individually wrapped. A good habit is to collect any good tinder you find on the trail as you go if it is a bit damp you can keep it in an inside pocket and dry it out with your body heat throughout the day. There are plenty of good sources of natural tinder, some work well as they are, others may need a bit of preparation. In Europe bracket fungus has along history as a tinder and many other fungi and lichens will also work well when dry. Partially rotted wood from resinous woods can also be good and pine sap can be an effective accelerant if not an actual tinder per-se. Often natural tinder will need a bit of preparation. Usually it is enough to scrape the surface with a knife or rock to produce a fine powder which will catch a spark more easily. You may also find that with natural tinder some is good at catching spark and you then need something a bit more fibrous to get a flame from the resulting ember. You can also make good tinder from char-cloth this is obtained by partially burning cotton (or similar plant based textiles). You can make this in bulk by heating cotton in a partially sealed container or just carry a roll (like a bandage) and it should charr itself as you use it. Obviously a lot depends on the environment you are in and it is well worth experimenting with anything which looks likely before you really need it. 

If you put a plastic back over your head, you are going to suffocate. A good bivvy bag should be designed such that suffocation is not an issue. However, breathing into a bivvy bag is a terrible idea because the vapour in your breath will condense and make you wet. Make this question a non issue by not breathing into your bivvy bag. Leave an opening. Check the manufacturers recommendation on your product. I bet it gives the same advise. Andy Kirkpatrick has talked about a time when he was bivvying in Patagonia in a special bag made by Rab Carrington. The bag had a 'snorkel' of sorts to allow for breathing. During sleep Andy had a suffocation experience because the snorkel had collapsed. Sorry i dont have a link to this. 

If you have to carry all your water with you then you might as well use 'wet' food rather than dehydrated as it works out at the same weight in the end anyway. Pouch type meals are becoming increasingly mainstream and have the advantage of being perfectly palatable cold and straight from the packet. In cold weather you can carry them in an inside pocket of your clothing during the day so they aren't stone cold. Personally I often like to use food which doesn't actually require any cooking at all and just use a metal mug and very simple solid fuel or alcohol stove for hot drinks. For low fuel cooking cous-cous and noodles work much better than rice as they will rehydrate eventually even in cold water and are quick and easy enough for lunch also both seem to soak up flavours better than rice and, for my taste at least, end up giving you more palatable meals. It is also worth considering things like unleavened bread (chapattis, roti etc), rice cake or crackers, which keep well, are light and robust enough to survive a week in a pack. Also useful are flavoured oils, things like chilli and garlic infused oil or toasted sesame oil. These pack a lot of calories for their weight, keep well and vastly improve the flavour of hiking food. Decant them into small plastic squeezy bottles of an appropriate size for your tip and add a dash to your food. Things like chorizo and sardines or tuna in oil achieve much the same thing and add some texture and protein. 

Firstly... your picture features a french prusik or autoblock knot. BUT it's a badly tied one. There are 3 parts of the knot: 2 tails plus the length of the wraps. These 3 parts NEED to make an equilateral triangle. The knot will probably still work if this is not the case, but the knot is optimal when it makes an equilateral triangle. Regarding twisting; I assume you mean the knot deforms and becomes messy when loaded. Don't worry about it, the knot still works and thats all that matters. My comment about the geometry of the knot was taught to me by Tim Neil, the highly experienced mountain guide, whilst on the Jonathan Conville course supported by plas y brenin. By optimal, i mean the knot will hold under load, and will release easily when required. Edit: Here's a better example of the knot. Note the 3 lines are roughly equal 

As others have mentioned there is a whole spectrum of fabric shelters. A few decades ago the difference was much more pronounced between a tent and a tarp. My first tent was a Vango Force 10 which my Dad had used before me and is built something along the lines of an air raid shelter in cotton canvas, rubber and aluminium. It is extremely rugged and still widely used for mountain base camps but is not by any means light and putting it up properly is a fairly serious exercise. My next tent was a Force 10 Featherweight which is astonishingly robust for very light weight but tiny inside. When I needed to camp for fairly extended periods in one spot (for static workshops rather than hiking) for extended periods or in the car I got a generic 3 man nylon tent with a big porch. I also own various tarps and bivi bags. For me the big advantages of a tent are twofold, firstly you can pitch a tent absolutely anywhere as modern tents especially are self supporting structures so you don't rely on trees etc to pitch them. Secondly a tent provides a reasonably large and comfortable space in anything but the most extreme weather. Similarly modern materials like composite poles and nylon skins hugely reduce the weight and assembly effort of a small tent, especially if it doesn't have to deal with extreme conditions. On the other hand a tarp still has some significant advantages. They are good as a lightweight backup if you don't intend to camp but might have to. They are also very versatile as they can easily convert from a small closed in shelter for sleeping to a more open awning for working under in bad weather as well as being pressed into service as a groundsheet, poncho or sack, rain collector or stretcher. There are also specific environments (i.e. jungle or deep forest) where a tarp and hammock is clearly the best option either because there just isn't room to pitch a tent or the ground is too sloping, rocky or wet. Also in hot climate a hammock tarp and misquote net may provide the best compromise between protection from insects/snakes and ventilation. 

There's probably a few more. With regard to fall factor, it's less of an issue with sport climbing indoors since your unlikely to be doing a multi-pitch. The likelihood is that people clip way above their heads because they fear falling above the last clip. I do it myself sometimes. Don't be scared, theres little reason to be. rock n ice article $URL$ 

Recently i was forced to take a long nap in a particular set of toilets at the top of a particular peak after missing the last bin down. I had no bivvy gear, but the toilets were heated and i was able to sleep reasonably well. I sprawled out my rope on the floor and slept on top of it. I'm interested to know if there is a particular way of doing this for maximum comfort. Ta 

Food When you're backpacking meals can be an important highlight of the day so if you find that morale is an issue it may be that having better food helps. This may involve carrying a bit of extra weight but even simple tings like sauces and spices can help a lot. It can also be that people aren't used to eating and drinking enough when they are walking and so get tired and hungry during the day. Here adding extra food meals to the day and packing easy to east snack can help. Weight It may be worth weighing packs and distributing the load according to ability, fitness and experience. Inexperienced hikers will tend to both pack more and be less used to carrying weight so sharing out individual pack weight may make everybody happier and help to even out pace. Objectives Try to get a sense of what individuals want to get out of a trip, some like walking for its own sake, some enjoy being in a natural environment and others want a physical challenge. If you have mixed motivation in your group try to reconcile the differences Route planning Severe up and down hill routes can be difficult even for reasonably fit people who are unused to walking Involvement Give people responsibilities to think about. Playing follow the leader is always less interesting than being an active part of an expedition. Eg if you are leading an inexperienced group let them take turns to navigate (even let them make small mistakes) and get the whole group involved in route planning and decision making.
