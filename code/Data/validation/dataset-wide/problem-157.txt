As some commenters have said, depending on what it means by "quality of shadows doesn't matter", and ignoring the obvious logistics of him casting no shadow, there are a few possible options. One: If there is a certain threshold for which a shadow "counts" (e.g. requires a certain amount of surface area (removes the use of microscopic bumps) and is required to be a certain darkness (removes the use of very faint shadows), but assuming he can move to ANY shadow once in the world (even if it's not connected to the entry point), the obvious solution is to trap him in a room and fill it with a brilliant light before he can react. Since he casts no shadow, he will be unable to enter the shadow realm, if nothing else is in the room. He is now trapped. Two: A slightly roundabout solution. If shadows need to be connected to the entry point for him to move around, eg. he needs to stay in the original shadow mass, lure him into a room and shut him in there. Light up the outside of the room, and make sure there are no gaps to slip through. He can only step into and out of the shadows in the room, and cannot get outside. Then, use a light source to shrink the shadow, until you can cover it with a box, then carefully close the box. He is now trapped in the darkness inside the box. Three: Fight him with an energy-based, magic being, like a fire elemental. A fire elemental produces light and casts no shadow for the thief to exit into, and will illuminate the room to eliminate any other shadows. Knock him out, wear him out, something. He's now trapped. Personally, his powers are most plausible if quality does matter. Even if it's a mild distinction, his abilities likely would need to be at least limited by the darkness of the shadow. 

Either the Thomas Saint sewing machine from 1790 or the Charles Wiesenthal's proposed embroidery machine from 1755 (as far as I've found the only evidence is a patent for a needle design) is generally considered the first sewing machine. From the design illustration filed with the patent it seems like Saint's machine could have been invented earlier. Most parts (such as gears, cogwheels and cranks were known by the roman empire by at least early third century BC) the question would be whether current time metalworking would allow sufficient miniaturization of these components (The Antikythera device suggests that it would at least around 2nd century BC). So, in theory... yes, I think they could have. But as Alberto Yagos said before me. The need never arose. Mainly because almost any manual labor can be solved by tossing more slaves unto it. Is one slave to slow to sew tunics for your army? Try two slaves, or ten, or one hundred... we'll have a sweatshopatorium set up right by the pottery workshop, the cattle yard and the tanners. If you manage to invent a reason for them to need the machine though, I think they could have invented it. 

The thing with Kowloon Walled City was not the denseness, it was that there was nobody enforcing the rule of law. It was basically an abandoned area where the monopoly on violence was ceded to the organized crime gangs. Just make sure you have a police force and preferably a small standing army that is separated from the police. Be strict on corruption. Provide fundamental human rights, such as healthcare and social securities (if you're American these may or may not register as fundamental human rights, but in most European countries it's not up for debate and lacking them will make people leave if they can and you end up having to force them to stay at gunpoint). Also, there needs to be an incentive to live so densely packed. Preferably you have a highly thriving economy. Moving to your state will be a betterment of life for the inhabitants. They will be better paid and have nicer (if somewhat smaller) apartments than if they lived in the surrounding country/countries. Child care and hospital care will be better. If those things are in place, the walls will have to be to keep people out, not in... Edit: SZCZERZO K≈ÅY Is right, a well functioning sewage system should not be overlooked. Also, of course, as some might point out good opportunities for sunlight and recreation is important to the well being of your citizens. Utilizing the rooftops as terraces is a good step, but being able to reserve some of the ground space to use for a park is a good investment in quality of life. 

I have a scenario that I have, and I feel like I have it fairly well developed, but I can't shake the feeling that there's something more to it than I expect. So here's the scenario: The Draconi are a race, effectively, of dragons in human form. Think lizard-men, but able to breathe fire. They exist in a medieval, D&D, World of Warcraft, Lord of the Rings kind of world. They are the kind of nobility who enact the typical "luxurious royal life contrasted to miserable peasant life" in their kingdom. Recently, the Draconi King and Queen have gone off on a continental voyage, leaving their son, the Prince, to rule. However, in their absence, the Prince has taken an iron fist to the kingdom; never truly taught to learn restraint, he now takes a slightly bratty, "take what I want because I can" attitude, very similar to the real-world Roman emperor Caligula. He spread his rule outward into neighboring, unruled villages and towns, and violently conquested them. He's become legendary and infamous. There's rumors he kidnaps women for his own pleasure, and they might not be untrue. However, a few factors prevent other kingdoms from going into war with him: Number one, the Draconi Kingdom is one of the most powerful kingdoms, ever. They have an enormous military, and on top of that, they have tamed dragons - there have already been discussions about the overwhelming power of dragons as a military device. Number two, the Kingdom is powerful economically as well; it is set on top of a very mineral-rich region, and has a high number of valuable exports. And three, it is currently surrounded by a large ring of uncolonized wilderness, which takes about a month to cross. The Prince has refrained from waging war on any other kingdoms for strategic reasons. I've already considered assassinations, attempts to overthrow, rebellion, the considerations of war and the like. But I still can't shake the feeling that there's something that's slipping my thoughts. So my question is: Does the political status of this kingdom seem realistic? Are there factors I've failed to consider? 

All organisms on Earth reproduce by one or more of fission, budding, vegetative propagation, sporogenesis, fragmentation, gamogenesis, or agamogenesis. How could an organism reproduce using none of these methods? The first thing that came to my mind was manufacturing or viral infection, but I don't wish to rule out other options. (By manufacturing I mean a biological equivalent of industrial manufacturing or 3D printing. By viral I mean the parent injects a virus into a host which instructs it to grow more infector.) 

There are few examples of radiotrophic ecosystems on Earth. Of those discovered, the radiotrophs are limited to single-celled organisms and unique mutant fungi. The reason seems to be due to a lack of concentrated radiation. The Chernobyl reactor is an energy source similar to a star or steam vent, able to support more complicated organisms. What would be a natural equivalent that would drive high energy ecosystems seen on the surface and deep sea? 

I have wondered what a terrestrial ecosystem would look like dominated by cnidarians and ctenophores rather than insects and tetrapods. In order to fulfill the same niches I imagine they would need to be highly derived compared to their ancestral forms. Since their physiology is so different I am having difficulty figuring the path from, say, a jellyfish to a longlimbed Savannah grazer with a mass of tentacles for a face. 

Nine foot tall isn't that horribly oversized. Closer to a fantasy game Ogre than a giant so I don't think a sword would be that out of place. I know people recommend maces and clubs for all sorts of practical reasons, but like Palahvan wrote earlier the Armorslayer would make a very good choice and probably make him a horribly fearsome opponent. Although, if you want to maintain the swordlike thrusting (which might be an huge advantage if you've got 1.3 times the reach of your opponent) you might want to go for a Falcata. I'm by no means a swords expert so I can't tell if there was ever a two-handed version of the Falcata, but I can't see a good reason why not. (Someone with sword fighting experience may be able to tell us whether this is feasible or not. Remember that any material strenght issues are handwaved though as are - probably - the issue of wielder strenght.) There are two-handers in the same general sword family though. Most notably the Falx and also the Rhomphaia but they do not seem to have been designed with the heavy axe-like tip, rather they were hook- or sickle-like but of course fearsome in their own right. Also, if we're doing magic, are we doing enough magic to make it flaming, electrical or frosty if not for damage then at least for visual effect?
