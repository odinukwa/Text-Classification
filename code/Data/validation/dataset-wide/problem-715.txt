Having such a limited amount of time for a group ride that in order to finish it on time you would need to push group speed up to a point where the ride is not enjoyable or even feasible 

There are organizations that offer riding in traffic classes, they even plan with you your best commute route, I would look into that as a way to gain confidence. Keep in mind that if you are afraid or you doubt at some intersection or maneouvre it can be dangerous if someone decides they don't want to wait for you to make your move. Confidence and paying attention to your environment is best for safety, which includes, as mentioned above, claiming all the lane for you. Practice and get proper confidence on your skills, get a good helmet,(I wouldn't go for the full closed hwlmet because in the tradeoff between visibility and increased face security I think it is better to have more visibility), see that your bike is in excellent riding condition, gears brakes, etc, make yourself seen without blinding other road users, that's it. And then, rememeber you can't be 100% safe on the bike, but just walking on the city is also dangerous, we have to go outside the womb 

I ride Firefox Rapide 21S, a hybrid bicycle. It has factory fitted flat-riser handlebars with Shimano EF500 levers for V-brakes with gear shifter integrated. I am an unprofessional rider, I always liked riding fast, I gained knowledge about dropbars and actual road bikes after getting this one, as I realized I needed more to go faster. I was recently thinking about fitting a dropbar to it and then mount my existing levers onto the place of hoods, as it goes beyond my budget to purchase them. Will it be a good idea to do so? Will it even work if I tighten it really hard so it doesn't slip? Or, just not get into this mess and I'll be alright with fitting them on the flat portion of the bar? I'm also attaching images of levers, but not dropbar(I haven't bought them yet). 

Those are called gumwalls. With this keyword you can easily search for them. Brands I see mounted on my friend's bikes are the likes of bontrager, panaracer, schwalbe, but Id say that most tyre manufacturers have a gumwall offer. 

I did get chain slap damage on a carbon road bike, like one or even more millimeter deep scratch in the chainstay. I still don't know the reason, but chain seems to easily hit the lower part of the chainstay, the one that is not protected by plastic guard. Even going down one of those bumps in the road intended for slowing traffic makes the chain clack against the chainstay. So it can be a problem. Had never happened to me before. Bike shop tells they see no problem. I don't know why this happens, maybe the chain is too long ? It's got a compact style drivetrain which I had not used before (used 52-42 and 52-36) and the big hit came when going through a pothole in the road big ring in front and small sprocket back. I've had worse encounters with potholes ( to the point of banging tyres and bending rims) with not a scratch in the chainstay paintjob. But this bike is somehow prone to chain slap. Been wondering if it's a thing of compact drivetrains, or nothing to do with that. But yea don't just write off chainslap as a source of problems 

Is attacking downhills with coaster brakes where the sport of downhill mountain biking originated? Or did mountain biking and klunking grow up side by side? 

1.) This is a 1989 Cannondale SM2000, is that a good derailleur? 2.) Will these dropouts suffice for a coaster brake? What if I over-shorten the chain? Do-able? 

Hello I have a quill adjustable stem on a Raleigh Royale. (The bike is an absolute dream to ride, wonderful seat and great gearing) My issue is that the handlebars wobble, both front and back and side to side. They definitely don't wobble at the face plate area. I'm certain it's at the adjustable part of the stem. The bike is a Raleigh Royale. I've taken as many pictures as I can. Thanks 

Just estimating from the picture it could be late seventies early eighties I see similar bikes for sale at around 150 € With a bit of effort it coud be turned into a robust, efficient commuter, but it is not worth too much as antique. The frame is the best part, but equipping everything else new might get expensive. But the front wheel doesn't look that ruined, you could put new spokes. A thorough cleansing and lubing and new cables and that and the bike could go as it is. I'd put wider tires but that could be a problem with the fenders. Also old brakes like those can be weak, so that could prove a necessary change. 

I own Firefox Rapide 21s, which has Acera 7s(14-28t) groupset are rear and Tourney 3s(28-38-48t) groupset at front. In a recent accident, the rear derailleur took some impact and is bent now, it doesn't latch on to 7th &1st gear. I went to a mechanic he applied some pressure to make it straight, he said it(method) could potentially make the derailleur straight, and I don't want to spend money in getting a new one. While coming back home, I tried to shift up to 1st gear to see what happens -- it dug into one of the spokes, locking the tyre, making me fall. Now that spoke is bent and has become loose. However, the real question is: Now, I don't like the method he has proposed to straighten it. Hence, I have decided to remove all the gears and make it a single speed. My focus always has been higher speed, so I'm thinking of getting 53t×11t(chainring×sprocket). But I'm also thinking - the ratio that setup makes might be a little bit too much for me in all circumstances. Therefore, I was thinking of fitting a double crankset up front(possibly 34-50t or 39-53t) and single sprocket(possibly 12t or 14t, respectively). Or is that even possible? I goolged and looked at most places, but could find any answer. 

I don't like and it seems it's not welcomed to give product recommendation, but since you mentioned it, I bought the gps unit you looked at. Still haven't used its follow track feature, but I bought it because of that. If you are not interested in maps, probably the competitor polar m450 is a better choice. For some reason I don't like the scheme that goes "no gps bike computer with connection to phone for gps" but it doesn't look like a really bad idea and it is way cheaper. Since I wanted a christmas gift i didnt check the cell phone bike mount, but I would have given it a try. Also, keep in mind that for the price of a gps bike unit you probably can get a new cell phone with bluetooth and ant+, look that it has a good gps and battery life over camera quality or memory for instance, look that it is not very big and use it as a dedicated unit, but that would require research effort, and just getting a bike gps is more convenient. 

So I understand the difference between the sports but how diifferent are the bikes? are they essentialy interchangeable or are there special racing BMXs? 

Hey guys I have a specialized mtb with the old oval chainrings and lately it's been locking up. When I start pedalling "hard" or faster the crank stops turning and then jumps forward a bit and generally is not very pleasant. Please note the wheels keep turning fine. Has anyone had this problem before? It's happened to me on another, thankfully cheaper, bike that was stolen a year before I built my fixie (which gives me no such problems) a couple years ago. To recap, the pedals stop turning and then jump forward, stalling in a way, when I start to pedal harder, like up a hill or just on flat but faster. How do I fix this? Thanks for any help! I really love this bike! 

I would say a saddle like the one pictured is comfy enough for 11 miles, but you can uglify the bike for comfiness sake, police will not fine you. And casual clothes would fit perfectly aestethically. 

Starting from a dead stop, am afraid it is a matter of leg and core strength and handling skills, which seems that you do not quite have yet. They will come with enough riding time. In the meantime you can try to get the bike in motion by pushing the road with your leg as when you push a skateboard or a kid's scooter, then turning the cranks will be easier. I do this a lot to start when I am in hard gears, not only uphill. If the slope is too steep it may not work, but if slope is too steep you might not be able to resume climbing unless you go down and then turn 180 degrees ti face the hill again.
