Conservation of Energy One possible answer is: Both ends of the portal must have same potential with respect to gravitation and with respect to electromagnetic fields. This is very natural, since both portal ends are basically the same point of the space and there should not be anything special on the border. How does this manifest? As the gravity field of Earth leaks through the portals, the gates acquire false gravitational mass. (Not to be confused with inertial mass - it exerts forces, but does not make the gates harder to accelerate.) One acquires positive false mass and the other negative false mass, so the total change is zero. How big will the false mass $m_f$ be? If we assume the gates are spherical and have radius $r_g$, one is higher by $h$ meters from the other and they are near Earth surface, the potential difference between them will simply be $$ \Delta \Phi=gh\;, $$ where $g=9.81\;\mathrm{m\,s}^{-2}$ is the gravitational acceleration on Earth. To compensate the difference, an equal potential difference must be created by the false masses of the gates: $$ \Delta \Phi=\frac{m_f G}{2d}\;, $$ where $d$ is the distance between the portal gates and $G$ is the gravitational constant. By putting the equations together, we yield $$ m_f=\frac{2dgh}{G}\approx dh\times 2.94\cdot 10^{11} \mathrm{kg\, m}^{-2}\;. $$ In order to obtain the acceleration at the gate, we use formula for gravitational acceleration using the gate false mass $$ a_g=\frac{m_f G}{r_g^2}\;. $$ For example if the gates are 100 m above each other ($d=100\;\mathrm{m}$, $h=100\;\mathrm{m}$) and they are 1 m wide, they would acquire false mass $2.94\cdot 10^{11} \cdot 100 \cdot 100 = 3 \cdot 10^{15} \mathrm{kg}$, which is a mass of cube of water 14.5 km big compressed into a very small volume. This also means that the acceleration at the surface of gates would be $$ a_g=\frac{3 \cdot 10^{15} \cdot 6.672\cdot 10^{-11}}{1^2}=200,200 \;\mathrm{m\,s}^{-2}\;, $$ which is 20,000x stronger than Earth's gravity. They would probably tear anyone entering into pieces. Possible solution is to increase $r_g$ or to decrease $h$, even at cost that one of the portal gates will be levitating. (This should be possible, since there are forces between both gates trying to put them into the same heigth.) Short summary: 

This problem was solved by Sean Raymond. (Also here, here, here and here.) He calculated that you can fit four gas giants into a habitable zone. Each of them could have 5 planet-sized moons and a double-planet in both its stable Langrange points. Like this, you will get to 4*(5+2+2) = 36 planets. The gas giant planets are there to stabilize the whole system. You could still double the number by adding a second star in sufficient distance (100 AU) from the first one. So you would have two copies of this system, one for each star. We can ask how plausible is the stability of such system. The terrestrial planets orbiting the gas giants will be stable, since they are in the Hill sphere of much heavier body. Similar system is Jupiter with his Galilean moons. Double planets look also stable - double-planet is in a good approximation two-body problem, which is stable, and it is in the Lagrange point, which is stable place to be. (But we cannot rule out there would be some destabilizing iteraction between the gas giants and the terrestrial double-planets.) The most questionable factor is, if all four gas giants will fit into the Habitable zone. 

From the point of view of science, it seems very implausible. There are quite good reasons why lifeforms based on carbons might share the RNA/DNA-mechanism to store their genetic code (stable molecules from materials abundant in space, except for ribose). Even some of our base pairs could be used in alien species, since among many possible base pairs, cytosine, uracil, adenine, guanine and thymine are exceptionally stable with respect to harmful UV radiation and therefore a good molecules to use. But the genetic code, the translation table which tells the cell how to translate the DNA or RNA into proteins from which the bodies are built, is very random and would be almost certainly be different. In other words: DNA of both species would be mistranslated in the breeding process and no offspring could be born. Pleasant side-effect is, that we can very probably be never infected by an alien virus, since our cells will not provide the building blocks it asks for. Note: Even with identical genetic code, sufficiently different species will not produce offspring. Any independently evolved aliens would be genetically much further than, say, alligators and horses. I pretty much doubt there could be offspring of an alligator and a horse, even if they share (almost) completely the same molecular biology. Genetic code - short explanation: From Wikibooks: An Introduction to Molecular Biology/Genetic Code In the cell nucleus, DNA is used to store the genetic data. They are used in a following way: DNA gets transcribed into RNA and RNA is later translated according to the table of genetic code. Each three letters of the RNA code information about one amino-acid, which is used as part of the new protein. (Proteins make our bodies, but not necessarily alien bodies - then, the breeding would be completely out of question.) The table is quite universal for most of the organisms on Earth, but it evolved pretty randomly and it would take immense coincidence that they would be mutually compatible. 

Edit 1: Portals with nonzero inner length The previously presented calculations assumed that the portals have zero inner length. In such case, the difference in potential energies has to enter through the false mass of the portal mouths, which often lead to extreme forces near the mouths. But if there is space inside the portal, an inner length $L$, the forces can be signifficantly smaller. Problem is, the forces are not uniquely defined and one has to assume some things to get particular numbers. Let us assume that 

Global Circulation, Precipitation and Climate Hadley cells In meteorology, there is a very useful concept of Hadley cell. The biggest insolation is at the equator and from there, the heat has to be transported to the poles. In this process, hot air rises at the equator, because it is lighter than the cold air. The hot air cools down as it expands, which decreases its capacity to hold water and consequently, there is always lot of rain around the equator. The dried air then moves polewards. During this process, it turns eastwards because of the Coriolis force. Here, the rotation speed of the planet starts to be important. When the air completely turns eastward, the Hadley cell is disrupted and the air start going down. It becomes hotter and therefore dry, as is contains not much water. At the end of the first Hadley cell, there are usually deserts. For Earth, this happens around latitude 30Â°. Slowly rotating planets, like Venus, will have its Hadley cell uninterupted and this will not happen until the poles. Quickly rotating planets would have deserts and eastward winds much closer to equator - maybe there would not be big deserts at all, since they would merge with the rainy equator region completely. Overview Especially for non-earthlike planets, these are rather plausible guesses than hard facts. Use with caution. Temperature differences are for the 1 atm atmosphere. For denser atmospheres, they will be smaller, for thinner, they will be larger. Great references can be found here and here, and for a visual, you can look here. Earthlike planet 

To me, this seems quite general, and (I think) it does not trigger obvious counter-examples. For example fire is out of thermodynamical equilibrium, it is capable of replication, but does not undergo darwinian evolution nor consists of sufficiently complicated structures. Mule or other sterile animals are not alive per se according to the definition, but the environment in which they live and which produced them definitely contains life. This is a minor bug of this definition, but I do not know any better. Life needs fermions This criterion seems quite obvious. Fermions are elementary particles that follow the Pauli exclusion principle. Without it, everything collapses into one point or passes everything else and it is very difficult to imagine that there would be any reasonable complicated structured process involved. For example life based purely on electromagnetic waves is very implausible, since photons pass each other without noticing and they therefore cannot form structures. Obvious candidates are electrons, which create atoms and molecules together with nuclei. But for example in the Forward's book Dragon's Egg, there are aliens inhabiting a neutron star and they are composed of neutrons and some protons in very dense degenerate neutron matter. This seems plausible in principle, since neutrons are fermions and could theoretically form structures in this environment. Life needs liquids and membranes If we investigate life based on chemistry, it seems life needs liquids. This is not an absolute criterion, however it seems that life as we know it strongly depends on liquid environments. There are incredibly complicated chemical processes in a cell, that require very precise conditions (pressure, concentrations of chemical compounds, density, etc.) In a gas, like in a nebula in space, density fluctuates heavily and it would be very difficult to do anything so complicated. Moreover, it seems that life needs to separate the relevant complex molecules it synthetized from the outer environment. Plasma would be problematic too, since:
