you'll see the Sun's astrometric right ascension and declination for a 48 hour period. Let's look at one of the results and see what it tells us: 

I believe this is a misinterpretation of this tweet: $URL$ If you look at the reply chain, it starts with $URL$ where Alex Parker states "Also, last night while we were packing up I took a very quick image of the Carina Nebula with one of our #MU69occ cameras." The tweet in question states "This is what Omega Centauri looks like after just 500 milliseconds of exposure with one of the #MU69occ cameras." In other words, Alex Parker was taking images of various clusters with the camera he plans to use for the MU69occ event. The image targets have nothing to do with the occultation itself. I also went to $URL$ and took a geocentric view of "2014MU69" for the month of June and it confirms this object is nowhere near Centaurus. EDIT: I emailed Amanda M. Zangari (azangari@boulder.swri.edu) and her response was: 

No. The reason is that gas recycling only recycles only about 40-50% of the gas in a sun-like star, leaving the rest as a white dwarf that slowly cools off. Heavier stars are even less effective in converting their gas into a condensed core. So the process will tend to produce a fair fraction of heavier white dwarfs now in the early stages of the stelliferous era, followed by a slow emergence of lighter white dwarfs from red dwarfs in the rest of the era. Adams and Laughlin estimate that the final mass fractions will be brown dwarfs (never fused) 9.7%, white dwarfs 88%, and 2.4% neutron stars and black holes. In the post-stelliferous era some of the brown dwarfs will merge and make a few extra red dwarfs . 

If we assume the binary pair have equal masses, then by symmetry a star passing through their barycenter at right angles to their rotation plane will not change their symmetry. I did some simple simulations where a star with mass 0.1 flies through a binary in an originally circular orbit. The first case is with an interloper moving at speed 20. It passes through, losing a bit of momentum to the binary, that now moves slowly in the same direction. 

If you visit $URL$ you see several sky cultures that include various constellation shapes (you also get this directory when you download stellarium). As an example, lets look at $URL$ in particular the file $URL$ and line number 127 which reads: 

The 0h line, however, will look more like this (blue vertical line in the center of the image), and the celestial north pole will be in Cepheus: 

This frustrated me as well when I first used the Tycho-2 catalog. Not finding a well known bright star can be disconcerting. Quoting from $URL$ 

If you're willing to selectively believe Wikipedia, it's possible that Lowell did detect a 9th planet and that it wasn't Pluto. One reason to disbelieve Wikipedia (and the given source) and to credit Lowell here is that this 9th planet does have an effect on Uranus' and Neptune's orbits, so the discrepancies Lowell noted wouldn't have disappeared, they would have simply been reduced. 

The last humans in this scenario likely die of starvation and/or drought during a natural short-term climate fluctuation. The basic issue is that as the sun heats up there will be a gradual reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (due to plant life but also silicate weathering, which speeds up in warm environments). There may also be a reduction in volcanic outgassing, although I think the timeframe is too slow. This is bad for plants, since they will get less CO$_2$ to photosynthesise from, and it will reduce the climate stabilising feedback so temperatures will start going up as the sun increases in luminosity. Eventually we get to a runaway greenhouse stage where water vapour alone triggers overheating, but this is possibly long after the biosphere is mostly dead. The most complete model of this I have seen is this paper by Franck, Bounama, & von Bloh. They estimate complex multicellular life to go extinct in 0.8â€“1.2 Gyr. Note that this will happen long before the sun becomes even a subgiant. In any case, if this model is correct we should expect that slowly but surely the future humans would be forced to migrate to cool regions and would be especially limited by the dwindling biomass available. But beside this they will be subject to normal random climate fluctuations that sometimes create decade-long droughts or other misfortunes, and it is likely one of those that actually gets the last individuals. Of course, the scenario assumed makes some very strong assumptions. In order to remain recognisably humans over millions of years these humans would have to engage in deliberate genetic control, otherwise genetic drift will make them mutate into new species. It assumes that nobody does anything about the long-term trend. And so on. 

The star is slightly variable, but not enough to explain the following discrepancy: If the star's magnitude at 32.6 light years is -2.79 (definition of absolute magnitude), it would be about 9.6 times fainter at 101.06 light years (it's actual distance from us). However, that's only about 2.5 magnitudes fainter, nowhere near enough to bring it down to magnitude 4.66. What's happening here, and is this a one-off special case, or does this happen a lot? For reference, my calculation of the apparent magnitude: 

If you launch from the side of Mercury furthest from the Sun, parallel to the horizon in the direction of Mercury's orbit at 13 km/s when the Mercury-Sun-Venus angle is 53 degrees, your payload will reach Venus in 35 days, and its path would look something like this (each black dot = 1 day). IMPORTANT CAVEATS BELOW IMAGE. 

While near encounters with supermassive black holes are bad for the stability of solar systems [citation needed?], many intergalactic stars become intergalactic without a close encounter. They are part of streams and tidal tails that emerge when galaxies or globular clusters get tidally disrupted by another galaxy. Still, even while encounters with black holes are usually disruptive simulations suggest that some planets may remain around the star. This is most likely for planets real close to the star, like hot jupiters. 

The gravitational binding energy of a solar mass star of uniform density is $3GM^2/5R = 2.2774\times 10^{41}$ Joule. The energy of a typical supernova is $10^{44}$ J. So it looks at first glance like the explosion could disperse the other star... ...except that this assumes more than a thousandth of the supernova energy is absorbed and does work on the star. If the other star is more than 16 stellar radii away then it will definitely not be hit by this much energy. And even if it is close enough, converting radiation to mass lift is not going to be efficient. The nova will mainly heat up the surface layer down a few optical depths, meaning a few thousand kilometers get very hot but it is doubtful this does more than push the star away a bit and induces some wobble. 

You'll notice the local sidereal time jumps from being 0.82 seconds behind the sun's right ascension to 0.18 seconds ahead of the sun's right ascension in the one second period (showing the two matched sometime within that second, probably at 00:00:00.82 or so). However, the Sun's highest position (noted by HORIZONS as 't' for transit) occurs a little later: 

Scroll down once again (you can leave the remaining form values as is) and click the "Calculate" button: 

This doesn't really answer your question, but I read $URL$ and noted that footnote 13 (which is referenced by equation 8, although it sort of looks like 3^13) reads: 

As noted in $URL$ the length of sunrise/sunset varies from approximately 128/cos(latitude) seconds at the equinoxes to approximately 142/cos(1.14*latitude) at the solstices. More specifically, here's the length of sunrise/sunset at various latitudes: 

The intuition in the question seems to be that if stars get lighter and this makes orbits widen, maybe the same effect explains why the universe "widens". Stars are converting some of their mass into light, but this is a small fraction: the efficiency of fusion is about 0.5-1% of mass into energy. And many stars will not burn all the fusible matter in any case. Brighter stars also tend to lose mass through stellar winds, reaching rates up to $10%{-6} M_\odot$ per year or above. Starlight tends to escape galaxies, while the stellar winds mostly feed the interstellar medium. Most mass hence remains in the galaxies and stellar activities cannot explain their accelerating expansion. The small amount of escaping starlight and very hot gas does make galaxies a bit less strongly bound in clusters, but it is small compared to estimated dark matter halo masses and (maybe) infall of intergalactic gas. 

Since the collision is perfectly elastic, the ball's velocity goes from -80 km/h from the train's reference point (negative being towards the train) to +80 km/h from the train's reference point, a speed increase of 160 km/h. For a stationery observer, therefore, the velocity goes from -30 km/h (towards the train) to 130 km/h, an increase of 160 km/h. The situation you describe only applies if the train isn't moving. I made an error in units below, assuming the train is moving at 50 km per second (not hour) and that the ball is moving at 30 km per second (not hour), am I'm too lazy to correct it. The general principle, however, still applies. The confusion may occur because we're ignoring the train's loss of momentum, which means the train is going slower after the collision, and moving backwards in its own frame of reference. A slightly more detailed calculation: 

Is there any reputable published source on expected elemental abundances at the end of the era of stellar fusion? I am here interested in the contents of galaxies; much of intergalactic gas will be lost and remain primordial. Adams & Laughlin mention estimates of Timms that the final chemical composition will be $X\sim 0.2, Y \sim 0.6, Z \sim 0.2$ but does not analyse the composition in much detail beyond the chemical evolution of white dwarfs (which mostly happens in the later degenerate era). Fukugita and Peebles also make use of a very approximate estimate. It seems entirely doable to run an IMF model, add some intergalactic gas infall assumpptions, add some recycling assumptions for different mass classes, generate a composition and iterate until a limiting value. But it also seems to be a lot of work that I strongly suspect somebody has already done somewhere far better than I could do. Another, very crude, approach might be to argue that since we know the cosmic element abundances today after 13.6 billion years of stellar activity we can rescale them to a limiting value: $A(t)=A(\infty)(1-e^{-t/\tau})$ where $\tau$ is the timeconstant of stellar elemental conversion. That would give the desired $A(\infty)=A(t_\mathrm{now})/(1-e^{-t_\mathrm{now}/\tau})$ (at least for metals; hydrogen and helium would be depleted). This assumes that the rate of conversion does not change (highly doubtful, since it will be more red dwarf conversion of hydrogen to just helium in the future than in the past where many more heavy stars formed due to the peak of SFR). If we use the estimate that $Z$ will increase by a factor of 10 from the current $Z\approx 0.02$ we get $\tau=1.3097\cdot 10^{11}$ years which seems reasonable, and of course just $A(\infty)=10A(t_\mathrm{now})$. That would for example make 10% of the mass oxygen and 4.6% carbon. But it would be underestimating the r-elements produced in neutron star collisions (since these were more rare in the past) and cosmic ray spallation elements.
