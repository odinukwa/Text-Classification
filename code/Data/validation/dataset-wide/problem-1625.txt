I guess the question is really if the film (not video, it was shot on 16MM) shows an actual unknown primate. Probably not. From a credibility standpoint the film has always been difficult, if only because the original film has apparently been lost. Therefore, we only know what's in those few seconds of footage. I'd love to know what's on the reel before the famous sequence. As to the internal evidence you can garner from the film, I'd point to this frame from a later portion of the footage than you usually see. I'm not sure what's up with the sole of the Bigfoot's foot, but it doesn't look organic to me. 

He goes on to suggest using activated charcoal, though I would add that activated charcoal is much more expensive and should be disposed of more carefully. So while the baking soda may not work quite as well as advertised, it may still be the best option for most people. 

If he's publishing I'd say it's safe to say he's trying, but so far with no success, or even pregnancies. I'm also sure that if he is successful it will make headlines around the world, if only because the good doctor appears to be a bit of a publicity whore. There have been several other announcements that cloning has been achieved, going all the way back to 1978 and the book The Cloning of a Man, but none of them have come close to panning out. 

Later in the Starchild Project the promoters of the skull dispute the hydrocephaly explanation. I'd like an expert on the subject to take a look at that page because I wonder if the doctors quoted could have been thrown by the fact the the "Starchild skull" would represent a completely untreated case of hydrocephaly, and you'd probably never see that today. 

Here's the source of the article, from Denmark's national channel. That is as close to any official word on the commercial I've found. It seems to me it would be easy to film the player shooting the shots and have a digitally removed person throwing different balls back to simulate the catches. That would also explain why the ball does come back to him a bit quickly. So if the video was trickery to start with, there'd be little point in anyone trying to replicate it without trickery. (And WOW... The new contextual translating Google does is pretty amazing. There are still some rough spots, but... WOW.) 

Razie's right. Let's talk about vitamins/minerals and other nutritional/dietary supplements separately. (Nutritional = dietary, which is used in the sense of what we eat, not used in the sense of weight-loss "dieting" - although weight loss supplements also fit in this category). Many vitamins and minerals are absolutely essential parts of our diet - they play roles such as co-enzymes for many physiological functions, including the immune system. Vitamins are things like A/C/D/B vitamins; Minerals are things like Iron or Calcium. With a very well-balanced diet, we can get everything we need through our food - but most people in this country don't. Some foods (like cereals and rice) are "fortified" or "enriched" to be sure people are getting closer to 100% of the most essential ones because people often aren't (especially kids who are in a critical growing stage). If you want to be certain, you can track your vitamin intake using a nutrition calculator that includes vitamins/minerals. Eating a wide diversity of colors of vegetables and fruits is one way to help get more of the vitamin/mineral spectrum. For most people who don't carefully balance their diet, taking a regular multivitamin is a very common and appropriate way to cover the bases of what's necessary. Also: 

But not all vitamins/minearls are safe for all people; if you have certain medical conditions, there are vitamins you should avoid. Also, certain vitamins are toxic if you take too much. But there are also certain conditions where you need to take extra of certain vitamins. That's why it's important to ask a doctor what's right for you. "Nutritional supplements" is a very broad category of everything except food and pharmaceutical drugs. It includes vitamins/minerals, but also include a wide variety of things. It includes herbal preparations like Echinacea or St. Johns Wort (which btw is really essentially an antidepressant medication, complete with drug-interactions and side effects), to things that claim to build muscle, to things that claim to make you smarter, to the random new weird supplements with magical weight loss claims (like you see advertised on website banners everywhere, "1 weird thing I did to lose 1528735 pounds" or whatever). People often take these in hopes that it will help some aspect of their health - and some do help. Some are good. But others don't do much at all. - and worst, some do bad things. This is where we need to pause and talk about safety, because there are vast inconsistencies between supplements in terms of safety, efficacy, and truthfulness of claims. There is something essential that we all need to be aware of: Vitamin and nutritional supplements in the USA are not monitored nor investigated by the FDA, so there is no governmental monitoring of their content, quality, nor accuracy of claims of what they do. This does not mean that all are worthless or unsafe. It means we have to be careful consumers of supplements. At the bottom, I have links to look at interactions with other medications, as well as a couple notes on how to spot a good one. From [$URL$ 

Montagnier won his Nobel for work in the field of virology, so this stuff doesn't sound entirely within his wheelhouse... but it's close. I don't think it would be right to dismiss his claims out of hand. Has this research been published? Has any peer review been done, or has anyone attempted to replicate his results? 

The half-sibling in question is George Obama, who has lived at various times in Kenya and South Korea. (He also never knew his father, who died in a car accident shortly after he was born.) A few months after the Italian Vanity Fair piece saying he lived in abject poverty he was interviewed by CNN. 

Every month I peruse magazines like Fate and Atlantis Rising, and over the last few month there's been a lot of self-congratulatory chatter about the fact that Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier has supposedly done experiments that show some of the underpinnings of homeopathy have some validity. The Huffington Post wrote: 

In 1998 a book was published called The Slaughter: An American Atrocity by Carroll Case. It alleged that in June of 1943 at an Army base in Mississippi 1200 black soldiers were massacred by white soldiers, and the entire incident was covered up. The allegation prompted investigations and a documentary on the History channel, which was summarized as follows by the Philadelphia Citypaper: 

VC is also convinced that Lady Gaga is constantly revealing the Illuminati's plans in great detail to those who know how to read her videos, which is perhaps why Rihanna chose to be the princess of the group, not the queen. While VC takes Illuminati conspiracy theories to a silly new place, that's not to say there isn't a kernel of truth in the claim that there's occult imagery in some hip hop music. There certainly is. The influential artist Jay-Z has been including occult imagery in his music for years. As Mitch Horowitz told NPR: 

As the Citypaper goes on to document there could be no doubt that the situation at Camp Van Dorn was terrible and there certainly was violence. 

As you can see Peter Joseph has a tendency to make long lists that conform to his theory, but few of the items on the list are true or real evidence of anything. Conspiracy Science has a full accounting of the Zeitgeist movie and related subjects. It's well worth checking out, even if navigation of the site is a little tricky. More generally, did the literary Jesus take on attributes from previous savior characters? Absolutely. That's a natural process. Does this mean Jesus didn't exist as a historical person? I'd say no. Around the same time similar supernatural acts were attributed to many Roman emperors and even the mathematician Pythagoras, and we don't use that as evidence that they were fictional. When it comes to that long list of saviors, it helps to remember that much of what we know about other religions has been distorted by the lens of Christianity. Even if it's not on purpose, we tend to highlight those attributes of other religions that resemble our preconceived notions, and downplay those that are different. Most of those on the list don't resemble Jesus's story nearly so closely as Joseph would have you think, especially the ones from non-European cultures. 

For example, I take a Centrum daily multivitamin on recommendation from an M.D./PharmD because "Centrum has been on the market for so long that if there were a safety concern, it is statistically likely that it would have surfaced years ago already." I also take Calcium/VitD from another famous, older company. GNC is a company that's been around a long time, so I would trust a standard multivitamin. But I'm skeptical of some of their things because they put their brand-name on products that make some pretty extreme claims, as well as a lot of brand-new products, which brings me to the next point: 

Trustworthy websites that the medical profession uses: Medscape, Medline Plus (NIH), UpToDate, [epocrates] (an app, not free)10, NetWellness.org, mayoclinic.org, and other medical university-based health websites. There are also commercial websites and shows like WebMD, Dr. Oz, The Doctors... those are commercial companies/websites/shows that get revenue from ads and from talking about "cutting-edge" topics. I myself am skeptical about what I hear from them and read up about it myself on more scholarly or peer-reviewed websites. 

then they can make any supplement they want out of it - without even a burden of proof that their dosing quantity or combination with other chemicals is safe. Then, if a company wants to sell a new ingredient in a supplement, all they have to do is send the FDA 

In the mid 90's, the number of new supplements being produced each year was so high that the FDA to keep up with on top of medical pharmaceuticals that need to be tested, so safety monitoring was limited to pharmaceuticals. I wish that weren't the case, but that's how it goes when health safety doesn't get enough funding. We're left to to rely on supplement companies to be honest in their safety data. And we've seen plenty of times how less-than-honest advertisements and overly-ambitious (or just outright lying) claims supplement companies sometimes make - the FDA has had to step in numerous times to stop supplements that turned out to be unsafe, like the recent Hydroxycut FDA warning to "stop using immediately," which is also a class action lawsuit. The FTC even has had to step in where the FDA didn't on Sensa for example. To make a new supplement, according to the FDA, if an ingredient has already been 

I can't say I'm completely convinced someone who's actually worked in hip hop field would put the word "urban" in quotes like that, but it's impossible to know what the writer's actual level of involvement is with the music industry so long as he remains anonymous. The Vigilant Citizen (or as he call himself, VC) spends a lot of time deconstructing the lyrics and imagery in music videos and claiming to find the symbolism the Iluminati use to control the rest of us "sheep." Rihanna was an early target of VC, in particular the video for the song "Umbrella." Here's an example to give you an idea of what the website is like. 

But when you get right down to it the only real evidence of the alleged mass killing is Case's account of being told about the incident by one person, now dead. In the ten years since this was first brought up has any other evidence of a massacre been found? 

As near as I can tell most of the people competing with McGurrin were using the only other major typewriter at the time, the Caligraph. From The Phonographic World, Vol. 3, #12 (August, 1888): 

I'd like to offer an answer from a slightly different perspective. If the claim is that the QWERTY keyboard was designed to make typists slower, who were these typists who were so fast that they were causing problems with mechanical typewriters? Presumably on typewriters not using a QWERTY keyboard? In fact, there were no fast typists that predate the QWERTY keyboard. What we consider the first commercially viable typewriter was the Sholes & Glidden typewriter, produced and sold by Remington & Sons. It was not a huge success. As noted in American Heritage magazine: 

The video by postcarboninstitute doesn't give any hint as to what metric they are using, but the most likely one I could come up with with is that companies in the financial sector made up 40% of all corporate profits in the years before 2008. The problem is that corporate profits are not "the economy" -- in fact all corporate profits last year amounted to about $1.6 trillion (I couldn't find numbers that were Q4, but it probably won't change much), while the total annual GDP was close to $14 trillion. None of this is to make a judgement on whether or not this is a good state of affairs, but postcarboninstitute should have probably phrased that statistic differently for the sake of clarity.
