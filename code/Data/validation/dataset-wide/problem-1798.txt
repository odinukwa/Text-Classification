Is this because all requests containing in the name are passed to fcgi and so all rewrite rules are ignored? 

I have tried numerous methods to generate a password (e.g apache's ) but I am not able to log in at /Docs with the username and password specified in .htpasswd. I see the authentication dialog with 'Restricted Area' but the password is not accepted. I've tried the methods here: 

Redis was installed as root on Centos 6.7 using the following instructions (the default yum package is too old) using the following method: 

I have tried granting privileges on (this is a vagrant box) but the error persists. Can anyone suggest what might be causing this? I can connect to MySQL from a simple nodejs script on the same box without error using the same credentials. SELinux is disabled: 

But now I would like that the input to my script would only be the "rate". What would be a good way to calculate good latency and burst values if I only know the rate? The tbf man page says that the minimum burst should be the rate divided by my kernel HZ. This makes sense but it does not help me in finding a formula to calculate a sensible burst value from the rate. Possibly I want my burst value to be a bit bigger than the bare minimum? And how would I calculate a good latency value? Should the latency change with the speed at all? 

I'm using . It is up and running. I can SSH to it. But when it asks for password for any command - I have nothing to say. Where can I get this info? 

I like the concept of relying on third-party service hosting my data but what's the point of using super-fast NoSQL storage via remote hosting? It maybe in different datacenter or even country! And network calls always cost a lot in comparison with local storage. Or should I use a service like this just in case when I don't query it very often? 

does there exist a lightweight (when I tried apache it ate several hundred megs of memory) reverse http proxy which supports websockets? I was so far using pound which does not support websockets but now I want to add a backend which needs websockets to work. I considered nginx which I currently use in all of my backends and offers webproxy support. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to disable buffering of http requests with nginx. So file uploading will never be "streamed" to the backend but be cached by nginx first. I dont need load balancing or caching and SSL termination is only a nice-to-have. Which http reverse proxy gives me websocket support as well as "streaming" of http requests? 

IP addresses and domain names are fictional. How can I add a DNS record to forward only website traffic? If I alter the "@" A record to the webserver's new IP, will email be sent to the webserver? If so, what would happen to the mail if there were no mailboxes / mail server on the new IP? Whats the best way to ensure that $URL$ and $URL$ both point to a new IP? 

I want to to retrieve a list of the virtual hosts which are currently loaded and listening for requests i.e not just grepping the config files. It looks like does this but I am not 100% sure if that is just returning what is contained in the config files. 

create tmpfs partition in /etc/fstab cat /etc/rc.local (pseudocode) delete "tmpfs rsync" cronjob from /var/spool/cron/crontabs if there is any cp -r /path/to/non-tmpfs-backup /path/to/tmpfs/dir append /var/spool/cron/crontabs with "tmpfs rsync" cronjob 

I was looking for a way to move one VPS server(all OS configs, application structure etc) to another VPS hosting provider. I mean completely. Without manual reconfiguration and reinstalling all the applications after moving. Is it possible? I noticed that even if my hosting provider offers server images - it's not possible to install them on any other VPS hosting provider. P.S. Let's assume that we're moving between equal OS versions. 

I want to create a simple script that lets me limit the outgoing speed of an interface somewhere between 56k (modem speed) and 1MBit/s. I found that something along the following does the job: 

I'm running a Debian Jessie server hosted by a company (so I only get to access it remotely) with several LXC based virtual machines running on it which in turn run several services from XMPP to IMAP, SMTP and IRC. Sometimes, maybe twice per week, I observe the following effect: the server (the host and all the guests) becomes unresponsive for any TCP or UDP based services I'm running. I can still ping it but packets do not make it for 2 minutes at a time up to an hour for any TCP/UDP based services. Sometimes, the connection becomes rather shaky with the server being reachable in 2-3 minute intervals with small windows where I can establish a connection. I logged system stats like hard drive usage, CPU usage and memory usage over time and there is nothing out of the ordinary. CPU usage is generally under 20% and swap is never used. I would like to make my datacenter responsible for the problem but the server is ping-able the whole time, so I doubt that the problem is in the route toward my server. Since this problem occurs rather seldom, I would not like to take all my LXC services offline to see whether the problem is maybe connected to one of them. Instead, I'd like to be able to run some more diagnostics during the times that I observe this issue. Which other tools can I use to debug this problem? 

My goal is to have a certain directory to be available as tmpfs. There will be some modifications during server uptime in this dir and those modifications must be synced to non-tmpfs persistent dir on HDD over rsync. After server boot the latest version from non-tmpfs persistent dir must be moved to tmpfs and rsync syncing to be started. I'm afraid that rsync will erase non-tmpfs backup if tmpfs dir will be empty.. I'm doing it in this way right now: 

ec2 Micro type instance comes with only EBS storage - Should I backup everything critical from there? other ec2 instances come with local storage - Should I backup everything critical from there? s3 - Amazon does backups for me(somewhere deep inside), right?
