Mathematician here. It is very common for manifolds to arise that do not embed in Euclidean space in any obvious (or particularly natural) way. Indeed, the reason that mathematicians think of manifolds without a surrounding ambient space isn't necessarily Occam's razor -- it's just that it wouldn't be practical to develop the theory of manifolds in a context where an ambient space is always required. The simplest examples of manifolds that don't embed naturally into an ambient space are quotients of existing manifolds, i.e. manifolds obtained from other manifolds by identifying (or gluing) together certain sets of points. For example, the projective plane is a surface that can be obtained from a sphere by gluing together every pair of antipodal points. The result is a perfectly good surface (it's just like a sphere, except you only need to go halfway around to get back to where you started), but it's not immediately clear how to embed this surface into Euclidean space. Similarly, the projective special linear group PSL(2,R) is obtained from the special linear group SL(2,R) by identifying pairs of matrices that are negatives of one another. Again, SL(2,R) embeds into R^4 using the entries of the matrices, but there is no immediately obvious embedding of PSL(2,R) into a Euclidean space. Both of these examples are quite important in mathematics --- the projective plane is the simplest non-orientable closed surface and the main setting of plane projective geometry, and PSL(2,R) is a simple Lie group and is the group of all isometries (i.e. symmetries) of the hyperbolic plane. Part of what's important to understand here is that mathematicians don't use manifolds primarily as a way of describing shapes of physical objects. For a simple example, parabolas are quite important in mathematics, but not because you tend to see that many actual parabolas in everyday life. Instead, parabolas are important for a theoretical reason -- they are graphs of quadratic equations, and studying the graphs helps you understand quadratic equations better. As a general rule, the primary motivation in mathematics for studying geometry isn't to model physical reality directly -- it's because understanding geometry helps us to understand equations and other mathematical objects, which can then in turn be used to model reality. Abstract geometric manifolds like the projective plane and PSL(2,R) are very important in this regard, even if they don't necessarily describe a shape that you're likely to run into in real life. All that being said, it does turn out that every topological manifold can be embedded into a Euclidean space of sufficiently high dimension --- this is the content of the Whitney embedding theorem. According to this theorem, it's possible to embed the projective plane into four-dimensional Euclidean space, and it's possible to embed PSL(2,R) into six-dimensional Euclidean space. (Actually, PSL(2,R) embeds into three-dimensional Euclidean space -- it turns out to be homeomorphic to an open solid torus.) However, this theorem takes some work to prove, and you shouldn't have to prove such a hard theorem just to get theory of manifolds off the ground. In addition, there are some other contexts than topology where embedding theorems are either very difficult or impossible to obtain. For example, if you consider Riemannian manifolds (the main objects of study in differential geometry), it can be very difficult to show that there's an isometric embedding of a given Riemannian manifold into a Euclidean space (see the Nash embedding theorems). For example, the hyperbolic plane is very easy to define, but it's very hard to find a smooth isometric embedding of it into a Euclidean space, and I think it's still an open question whether there exists an analytic embedding (i.e. an embedding defined by a single power series formula). 

This video: Youtube: RSA Animate: The Divided Brain could help. Basically you have a right hemisphere which just notices movement and is at one with the environment. I myself have noticed that when I'm in "right brain mode" I "function" according to thresholds. I.e. I go eat when I'm hungry vs it's 12 o'clock and I need to eat. So the focus would either be on the details (left brain) or the whole (right brain). The more you focus on the details, the slower time becomes, especially if nothing changes. If you focus on the whole and you being a part of it, evolving with it you are not noticing time or details. There is a concept called Wikipedia:flow that talks about this state. 

Is the soul not eternal? Can the soul change? If it does then yes it moves. If it does not then it is static and motion-less. 

I guess you first need to ask for the justification for a justification. Why do you need one in the first place? I'd stipulate because you have to justify yourself in front of other people. And then it becomes a matter of if you do that then I can do that also. 

What does exist however is change. Can you travel in change? No, because you yourself are change, part of change. See it as a guitar - string that has been plucked and resonates or an echo chamber. But with the only difference that the echo or sound does not get muted but stays the same power, but only changes frequency and the echo chamber changing shape as a response to the frequency. Could you go back in time then to a place where there was a certain mixture of frequencies and a certain shape of the echo chamber? Theoretically yes. All you'd need was a substantially good sound-system and some means of measuring the actual and desired sound and shape characteristics inside the echo chamber without having the sound system and yourself inside the chamber to begin with, otherwise it probably would not be the same, unless you could cloak yourself or make yourself and the system acoustically transparent. The final thing you'd need would be some computer or device that could compute the necessary output frequency mixtures (properly positioned in dimensional space, no less), to get to where you want to be. Of course this needs to be transparent or non existent as well. Really simple when you think about it. Just use some non existing equipment and change history. :P 

The term "conspiracy theory" was invented by Karl Popper as a way to describe Marxist theories of history as a collusion of the bourgeoise class against the working class. So, as far as I can tell, someone actually arguing after Popper would say Marxists are actually seeing the world in a similar way to people who claim that climate change is a hoax, vaccines are poisonous, historical world leaders are reptilian, etc. by placing the motives of large groups of people in an "open society" under suspicion. From my perspective, regardless of value judgments about conspiracy theory, the entire "hermeneutics of suspicion" fits the category. Nietzsche's historical thesis is largely a conspiracy theory about the nature of Christianity, and many popular writers have interpreted it as such. Alex Jones claiming that "there's a war on for your mind" is being very legitimately Freudian. However, when I went to read the academic literature on this, I found that this view is in a distinct minority. Placing, say, governments, doctors, or environmentalists under suspicion is considered a "conspiracy theory," but Marx, Nietzsche and Freud are not generally claimed to be "conspiracy theorists." There are only a few sources that make such a claim, and they appear to be on the fringes of academic philosophy. I was unable to find any critical literature examining the difference between the hermeneutics of suspicion and conspiracy theory. I would appreciate any book recommendations, no matter how heavy. 

Children like making up stories and sometimes hit on several real facts about other people through totally random chance. Children can access the memories of relatives of a deceased person through some unknown mechanism. (Living psi) Memories drift around in the ether at death and sometimes fall into other people's heads totally independent of the question of survival of the soul. (René Guénon's "psychic residues") Stevenson was systematically deceived by his interpreters, or for some other reason didn't see what he thought he saw. (Cartesian demon) Regardless of what country you're in, for some reason -- pursuit of fame, confirmation of community beliefs, etc. -- people have a strong inclination to fake reincarnation-like incidents. 

Is it possible to have an original thought and express it in english? Yes you can have an original thought. And then later you can express this though in English. Just because you are using a language not invented by you does not preclude you from having your own original thoughts and express them in any way means shape or form. You may not have been the first to express this thought, but that does not mean that it did not originate from you in the first place. Everybody can become hungry. Yet you probably would not say that you are copying your hungriness from others when you express that you are hungry using the English language. 

Is there a way to objectively determine which is better? Kill injure person and damage a car and a tree or kill several people. After reading this story about people preferring to save 10 people, but only if it is not themselves in the car. $URL$ Essentially it makes sense to me to not want to sacrifice yourself by default. What if there are no pedestrians but the car runs into the tree or other car anyway? I know this situation is very hypothetical and I guess that's the problem with this question. Hypothetically it makes sense to favor the many over the few. But not in every situation. Is there a simple logical way to deduce this though? 

The definition according to the built in dictionary of OS X is: profoundly immoral or malevolent. So there are morals and will involved. Morals are about right and wrong. And I quote again the OS X dictionary: 

Gift "Middle English: from Old Norse gipt; related to give." So a "Gift" is something that you have giveth. Or you gave to some person, without receiving anything directly in return. Since the purpose of Gifts are usually to strengthen social bonds there is no "free" gift. Depending on society the receiver will be obligated towards the giver/gifter in some way. If only subconsciously. 

Lots of overhead in order to do work. You can only employ one human to do this job since lots of waste accumulates. Little overhead. You can use the savings to employ more people to do more work with the same amount of money/energy/time/food. 

Is it possible to use empirical evidence to build a case that reincarnation really happens? (Note 1: This is separate from the question "can belief in reincarnation be justified in general?" See: Ought we only form beliefs based on sufficient empirical evidence?) (Note 2: This question was partially borrowed from a deleted Skeptics.SE question by njfife. My answer will be copied from there) 

No, reincarnation is not open to empirical validation: The problem of how life after death can be scientifically studied is not a simple one. Parapsychologists believe progress can be made in a scientific fashion, but they have received doubt both from the skeptic community and from sympathetic, neutral philosophers of science. It is this latter criticism I will focus on. The remainder of this answer is an extremely brief and hopefully accurate discussion of Michael Sudduth's new book A Philosophical Critique of Empirical Arguments for Postmortem Survival (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016). The example of Ian Stevenson's work on reincarnation is pretty straightforward: he proposes to simply find case studies of alleged reincarnations who possess factual information about their past lives that they couldn't have come across by normal means. This would seem to be evidence of some kind of paranormal activity, and indeed, much of the criticism of Stevenson has focused on trying to disprove his dozens of examples. However, what Stevenson provides is data, not a hypothesis. The "survival hypothesis," the statement "The soul survives death", does not cause us to expect any this-worldly phenomena in itself. We could be living in an orthodox Christian world where the future states of the soul do not affect us in any way. That doesn't make the claim unusual; according to the Durhem-Quine thesis, there are very few scientific claims that can be falsified by themselves. To restate Wikipedia's example, Galileo seeing rings around Jupiter could be explained by Jupiter being surrounded by a dozen small moons and thousands of tiny objects in a ring, or it could be explained by a scratch on the lens of Galileo's telescope, as one of the other intellectuals of the day suggested. So, a truer statement of Galileo's hypothesis is actually "Jupiter has rings and I can see them perfectly well through my telescope". The second half of this is called an auxiliary hypothesis. It's not essential to the main hypothesis but we need it to get from the data we currently have to the main hypothesis. Similarly, the survival hypothesis in a more testable form must make more specific claims that cause us to expect data, like "The soul survives death and goes to Heaven, and people can experience this themselves through near death experiences," or perhaps "The soul survives death, reincarnates sometimes on Earth, and retains at least some of its memories, and we can confirm this and rule out cold reading through carefully controlled interviews." The latter is closer to Stevenson's actual view. But we are not done with auxiliary hypotheses yet, because at some point they lose explanatory power. For example, if Stevenson were to narrow down his claim to "I myself spoke to a reincarnated person once, in a unique event that cannot be duplicated," that's not particularly helpful for our lives. In the more general form he gives in his books, Stevenson's claims can be explained in all sorts of other ways: 

You can validate Induction by creating a (climate) model and run it. The only problem I see with induction is that the person doing the induction is part of the thing it induces. So this is like the observer effect. You are affecting the system as you are measuring or inducing it. That's why we are supposed to live in the now. For that is what only exists. The past and the future and the now we are talking about while we are talking about don't really exist. While you talk about the now it has already passed. You cannot talk about the now. You can only be in the now. Or in other words you are the now. Now that means now is you and you is now. You would induce yourself which would mean you are no longer you and in the now but creating a simulation of yourself which is born out of you but not identical with you. So my summary is: Any induction is by definition talking about a smaller group of relations than the relations it tries to describe because it is a new relation itself. Thus it is always imperfect. 

A person is an emergent thing. Can a man built machine be called emerged maybe. By emergent I mean flexible, adaptive, in relationship to whom it's interacting with. Like a bell. It sounds different when you strike it differently. But compared to a bell a person changes shape and evolves over time. 

According to karma you get what you give. Karma = cause and action (Wikipedia) Now if you gain/retain you somehow get more than you give. So there is an imbalance between the receiving and the giving part. Eventually the gap/difference between the giving potential and the actual giving could become to great. But what you get must not be of the same form as what you give. So that means you can offset your gain in one currency by providing or giving in another currency. For example leadership. So you could be a leader that gives leadership and receives sustenance and power in return. If you keep on giving good leadership then the universe or karma or people or your subconscious will help you in getting compensated accordingly. So instead of asking, can you gain without loosing I'd ask. Can you loose without gaining? The answer is of course yes. Every possession is a burden. If you loose a possession like an amulet or watch or anything ornamentally. You have lost an item but gained space to replace the item with another one. In essence you have regained freedom.
