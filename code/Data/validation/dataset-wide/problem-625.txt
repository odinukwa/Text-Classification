I recently (2 months ago) bought my first set of clipless pedals (first pedals I have ever bought, just used default ones before). Shimano M545. All was well till this morning when I noticed that the left pedal has lost the bolt on the side that holds it together, (think its called the cap unit bolt). This cap unit bolt and the washer bits have disappeared, presumably during a ride. Here is a link to shimano's site that shows the pedal and the cap unit bolt bit: $URL$ I took it to my local bike shop and they say they do not have a bolt for it. Can this sort of thing be found / bought and replaced or do I have to replace the whole pedal? I bought it from Wiggle and have just contacted them about the issue but wanted the advice from the community about how I can deal with this situation. Thanks 

Find a good LBS (Local Bike Shop) that deals in road bikes and has a used bike section. They might not have something for you right now, but if you talk to them, tell them what you are looking for, try some new bikes to get a really good handle on the size you are needing, they may just give you a call when the right trade-in appears. 

Get a seat bag and have at least one spare innertube, a multi-tool, spare CO2 (if that's your inflator of choice, a frame pump otherwise), and park a $10 bill in there. It's not a matter of 'if' you have a mechanical, but 'when'. Anticipate it, prepare for it, and deal with it. More than once (because I don't learn quickly) I got as far from either end of my ride and had a flat. I ended up riding home on my rim, which is BAD. Additionally I have a laminated photocopy of my driver's license in case I'm unresponsive, but that may be overkill. 

Politics is the reason.* Specifically, the weakness of an official body in the face of lobbying by a special interest group at a critical juncture. Market forces did the rest. More specifically, in the years prior to 1934, recumbents had been gaining in popularity, race success, and public awareness. Then, in 1934, a lobby group of 'upright' bicycle manufacturers persuaded the world governing body for sports cycling (the UCI) to ban recumbents from its events. The UCI, in a move that has harmed human powered transport ever since, caved to the lobby. This was a turning point in the history of cycling. The ban had numerous ramifications. It reduced demand for, and use of, recumbents among competitive cyclists. This, in turn, led both to: 

Putting a little glycerol (aka "glycerin" or "glycerine") in the water will help. Glycerol is edible, sweet to the taste. It will do double duty by giving you a few extra calories, and lowering the freezing point of your solution because it acts as an antifreeze. Because it's also bacteriostatic, unlike sucrose/glucose, it also shouldn't encourage microbial growth in the hydration system. Unfortunately, sports drinks probably shouldn't contain more than about 8% carbohydrate, and an 8% glycerol solution will only give you about 1-1.5ËšC extra headroom. 

About 30+ years ago I bought my first road bike. It had an old (used) Brooks leather saddle on it, whose design probably dated back to 1900 AD. To anyone who hasn't seen these, 

As you ride in the wet, try to plan your trip around all of the slippery surfaces already mentioned. When you cannot, try to stop turning and braking until clear of the bad stuff, then get back on it. I wanted to comment on surfaces others have mentioned, with "that's the worst" or "this is even worse than that!"...but anything besides clean pavement can be a hazard. Something else you might do if planning to ride: realize that visibility for drivers goes way down; get lotsa lights. I keep a front flasher going throughout the day, as well as a regular tail light and a helmet-mounted tail light. The best bike I saw, the rider had colored light sticks on his spokes, lights on his handlebar ends, saddle, helmet, 2 headlights. It seemed like overkill, but I could see him through a rain-spattered windshield easily. Remember, being hit by a car once is worse than multiple slips and falls. 

I have been having what I believe is called chainsuck for a while now. Chain will get stuck between first and second ring and have to stop and pull like "%&$* to get it out. It is always the between the first and second. From reading a few posts it looks like the sensible approach is to (at minimum) replace the first and second rings as well as the chain. My question is: 1) should I replace all of the rings or is it OK to only do 1 and or 2? 2) do I have to replace the rear cassette at the same time? 3) Is this pretty hard (just starting to learn how to do some mods, cleaning and maintenance my self). EDIT on further inspection, the middle ring has lost some teeth, got a nice bend in one bit and shark fin look to some of the teeth. This was replaced by "halfords" a while ago, guessing they put some rubbish ring on there. The first ring is a bit shark fin like, but the outer looks pretty good. 

Remove the chain and put a string on it to fish it out of the gatorade bottles Simple Green: I have an old gatorade bottle full of 50/50 diluted Simple Green, which is a great degreaser. Put the lid on (with string outside, for chain removal). Shake it up baby, now! Really work it. Remove the chain when it looks clean enough. Grime will accumulate at the bottom of the bottle, but I just cap it and reuse the Simple Green again next time. Clean water: Hot is best. Another Gatorade bottle with water, put the chain in, shake shake shake. This is to remove the Simple Green. I don't save the water, just dump it out. Hot will evaporate off the chain more rapidly and dissolve the Simple Green more quickly, but cold will do. 92% Isopropyl alcohol: water rusts chains (bad!). Water dissolves in alcohol, and the alcohol then evaporate super quickly. So, chain in Gatorade bottle of alcohol, string outside, cap on, shake shake shake. Remove the chain, watch the alcohol drip off and evaporate in no time. 

Have a suitably skilled person braze (for steel or aluminium) or graft (for carbon fibre) an eyelet onto the frame, of sufficient diameter to accommodate a good U-lock of sufficient length to enable you to secure the frame to a bike rack. (IMO, all recumbents should be offered with such a feature as standard.) Secure any relatively removable parts of the bike by threading a good chain through them and locking that, too, with the U-lock. 

(N.B. These saddles are from a spreadsheet I compiled more than a year ago. Feel free to edit this answer if any of the links need updating.) 

These factors persist today, and have left us with a tragically low level of public awareness of recumbents and their many advantages. Matters were not helped by the fact that World War 2 occurred not long after the ban. People worldwide, including those who might otherwise have been working to create a revival of the recumbent, were distracted by more pressing matters like staying alive. The war, and also various subsequent public policy decisions afterwards, also strengthened the hand of the motor vehicle lobby. This further eroded the market for recumbents in some countries, although apparently they remained popular in France. *Possibly :-) Causality is hard to establish with certainty, in historical reasoning, because we lack omniscience. Here is a perhaps more informed account ;-) 

You can, but it depends on whether the particular trainer will accommodate a 26" wheel. I have two trainers, one that will work on a mountain bike (found at a garage sale), and one that won't quite adjust close enough (so I use that one for a road bike only). Best check the specs closely before buying a trainer. 

My method, which works very well and is fairly quick (although it required initial shopping and drinking some Gatorade): Edit: this requires having one of those reusable 'gold links' to detach/reattach the chain at will. 

There are 3 size aspects to a crankset (and, of course, lots of variations between product lines as far as materials, color, price, etc.). 

I use a product called 'Purple Extreme', originally developed for offshore oil rig components. I guess it is 'dry', because it dries on the chain (although you can use it immediately, they recommend letting it dry on first).
