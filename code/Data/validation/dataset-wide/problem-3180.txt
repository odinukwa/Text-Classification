Using this sequence, between 1600 and 1900, the British slowly expand until they controlled India's core, and spread their control to Myanmar (Burma), most of the Middle East, most of Africa, and significant portions of Southeast Asia. (These areas also were impoverished by the British expansion process.) So what about China? Some additional background: The British loved tea, and by the late 1790's, they were importing a ton of it. It led to an outflow of bullion to the Qing dynasty, causing economic problems in London. The British knew that to address this, they had to find something to sell to the Qing Chinese. However, at that time, Qing China was both wealthier than Britain on a per-capita basis, and in many ways more technologically advanced - especially in manufactured goods. The British were more advanced, however, at war-making. However, as previous posters say, it is difficult to control China through military conquest. It wasn't the British method anyways; they chose instead to use economic means to conquer China.Source So in the early 1800s, the British East India company had independent traders (i.e., colonial subject "businessmen"), with financial backing from London, to smuggle opium into China. Over a period of 30 years, more and more Chinese became addicted, and the British balance of payments improved. Over time, opium addiction caused widespread social problems and poverty, so the Qing tried to put a stop to it, and the Opium wars ensued.Source British advanced war making technology, (warships, etc) made a mockery of the Qing military system, and required Qing grant "treaty ports" to the British in 1842. In this way, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shanghai and more came under British control. Between 1842 and the 1930's, China became weaker and weaker, and the British (and other colonial powers) came to inherit Chinese material wealth. It is doubtful that China could have escaped British colonialism if the global international power structure had not been radically altered by the rise of the Soviet Union, Fascist Germany, World War II, the rise of the UN, and the decline of colonialism in the 1960s. 

Really though, China isn't that special. Just for sake of comparison: South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka) ~ 1.7 Billion China (China) ~1.4 Billion Europe (EU, Russia) ~0.9 Billion Southeast Asia ~ 0.6 Billion It would be easy to call China a 'continent' just like Europe; it is a large place with a long history, a ton of varied cultures and languages. The only difference is that it has a history of being unified. Whereas South Asia and Europe have never been unified. If one would be so bold as to call it "East Asia" instead of "China" we could include the Koreas and Japan, and East Asia would would have about 1.7 Billion, just like South Aisa. It is notable that European population is a little lower than the other two because there was large scale emigration between 1700-1950's. If we include South America and North America under the "Europe" column, also about 1.7 billion. 

The Oyashio Current and the Siberian High make Vladivostok a cold, frozen port. The answer can be easily summarized with this map. Look at how far north Ireland, England and Norway are. Yet they are far warmer than Greenland and Newfoundland! The reason is that warm water and weather flows from the Gulf of Mexico to Norway, keeping those places, that are near the sea, relatively warm. (Palm trees can grow in Ireland. Surprised me when first visited). Greenland and Newfoundland, on the other hand, receive cold water from the Arctic; the Greenland and Labrador current brings cold water and cold weather to these places. Note that Siberia is too far from the Atlantic to be warmed by the gulf stream. Something similar happens in the North Pacific. The Oyashio current flows from 'the north' to Vladivostock, keeping it cold. The Kuroshio Current, on the other hand, keeps Japan, Korea, and the Yellow Sea warm. (Port Arthur was located near Dalian in the Yellow Sea, so it was kept warm too). (Edit: I just read that it the Siberian High is more important that the Oyahsio current for Vladivostock winter. That Japan blocks the Kuroshio is important too.) I think historically, Russia had a long term habit of taking land from China during its colonial expansion. Vladivostok was aquired from the Qing Dynasty in the Amur Acquistion in 1860, likewise in the region around Irkutsk in 1727. Russia had significant claims in Northeast China, for example in Harbin. It wasn't until after meetings between Stalin and Mao that Russia fully relinquished its colonial rights to Port Arthur; and late in Gorbachev's time, just before the USSR collapse, to resolve border disputes between Russia and China. As this is a history not geology SE, I want to emphasize the source material that I quoted above. It is transcripts of the conversations between Mao and Stalin, where they speak frankly about the withdrawal of Russia troops from China and how to stop the US from invading. A second conversation is here. These documents are part of the Wilson Center Digital Archives that cover many interesting topics from the cold war. Another note: I am uncertain if Vladivostok is ice-blocked in these modern days of Global warming, but I think in the late 1800's that the harbor was a giant salty ice cube. 

In recent years, the South China Sea has become somewhat important from a geo-political standpoint. China is building military bases, among many other things, and the US has been speaking about containing a militarily aggressive China. As a student of history, it is important to look at this dispute in context not only of the current political motives, but also in terms of the history. 

Hainan was closer to Mainland China and would be more difficult to defend against amphibious assault, Taiwan had the advantage of being far enough away that it was difficult for the communists to invade. Taiwan had another advantage over other islands: It had been economically industrialized somewhat by Japan, as it was a colony between 1895 and the end of world war II. 

Kuwait was invaded in November 1990 by Iraq, and the Iraqis weren't ejected until February 1991; thus Kuwait ceased to exist for about six months. It can be argued that Kuwait had a government in exile during that time; but supposedly, South Vietnam still has a government in exile. 

Another point: Deng and the CCP required continued popularity to remain in power. Attempting to fully discredit Mao would have undermined their own authority. 

One theory is that King Phillip's war was the cause. The idea behind this theory is simple: When the pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock in 1620, the Native Americans aided them in establishing themselves, and helped them not to starve, by teaching the pilgrims, people who had lived as refugees in the urban Netherlands for a generation, to learn farming and survival skills. They even celebrated the first thanksgiving together. In New England, generally speaking, the contact between the Europeans and Natives Americans were more than cordial - there was intermarriage, and conversion to Christianity, and peaceful coexistence. By about 1670, the mixing of the two populations, combined with declining Native American populations and quality of life, set the stage for "King Phillips War" Supporting Source and Wikipedia links. The common narrative goes like this: Metacom, a Native American nicknamed "King Phillip" by the settlers, started attacking and slaughtering the colonial population. The English colonialist responded in kind, slaughtering the Native American population. Both sides killed whichever "enemy" they came across, including women and children. Persons of mixed heritage were victims of both sides. 5% of the settler and 40% of the Native American population died. The general slaughter led to well defined racial identities that didn't exist before the war, and set the stage for future separate ethnic trends in North America. There is, of course, an opposing theory presented in this book that the war was instead a civil war intended to increase British control of the region, which used "divide and conquer" strategies, split what was a unified community to increase colonial power. One results of the increase British control was marginalization of the Native population, and a stronger racial identity for the settlers. The British then used racial identity through the colonies to maintain power. "Divide and Conquer"
