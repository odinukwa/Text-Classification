PM Cohn's "Skew fields: Theory of general divison rings", CUP 1995 should prove a valuable reference. In particular, Proposition 2.3.5 states that for each field $k$ there is a skew field $D$ whose centre is $k$ and such that $D$ is infinite-dimensional over $k$. 

Let $q=p^e$ be a prime power and $\mathbb F_q$ the finite field with $q$ elements. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$ and let $\varphi: SL_2(\mathbb F_q) \to GL_n(k)$ be a representation. Is it true that $\varphi$ maps a diagonal matrix $D$ to a matrix $\varphi(D)$ which can be diagonalized over $k$? (The question in the title more or less boils down to this question.) Background: Since $\mathbb F_q$ is finite, $\varphi$ can be described by a polynomial map $f$ which is defined over $k$. Then $f$ induces a map $SL_2({\bar k}) \to GL_n({\bar k})$, where $\bar k$ is an algebraic closure of $k$. Suppose that the induced map actually is a morphism of algebraic groups. As the diagonal matrices are in particular a $k-$split torus and the map is defined over $k$, the image again will be a $k-$split torus, from which the claim would follow. But to all appearances the induced map will not be a group homomorphism, so I might as well have asked about the smallest counterexample... 

For a prime $p \neq 2$, the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_p \times \mathbb Z/(p-1)$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. Serre, A course in arithmetic, Theorem II.3.2 (p. 17). Since a field isomorphism $\varphi\colon \mathbb Q_p \to \mathbb Q_r$ will preserve the torsion subgroup of the multiplicative subgroup, this shows that $\mathbb Q_p \not\cong \mathbb Q_r$ whenever $\{p,r\} \neq \{2,3\}$. The remaining case is taken care of by the fact that $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ / $\mathbb {Q}_p ^{\times 2}$ $ \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$ whenever $p \neq 2$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ / $\mathbb Q_2^{\times 2} \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. loc. cit., p.18. 

Let $G$ be the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group equipped with its Carnot-Caratheodory subriemannian metric $d_{G}$. Let $U$ be a domain in $G$ of the form $V \times I$, where $V$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $I$ is an open interval (so $I$ is the third coordinate in $G$ corresponding to the center of the group). I'm going to consider uniformly continuous maps $f: U \rightarrow V$. Let $H$ be the left-invariant contact distribution on $G$. Let $d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}$ denote Euclidean distance on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. I want to consider a "quasiconformal" map $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ in the following sense: there is a constant $C \geq 1$ independent of $r$ such that for each $x \in U$, $y \in H_{x} \cap U$, $$ \frac{\sup\{d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}(f(x),f(y)): d_{G}(x,y) = r\}}{\inf\{d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}(f(x),f(y)): d_{G}(x,y) = r\}} \leq C. $$ In other words, for each $x \in U$ $f$ maps concentric circles in $H_{x}$ to quasiconformally distorted circles around $f(x)$. I want to conclude that if $A$ is a measurable subset of $V$ above with $m_{G}(A \times I) = 0$ ($m_{G}$ the Haar measure on $G$) then $m_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}(f(A \times I)) = 0$. So a form of transversal absolute continuity. Is this known? What makes me think this is true is that, if we replace $G$ by $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with the Euclidean distance with $H_{x}$ now being parallel planes orthogonal to the third coordinate, the conclusion follows from standard quasiconformal mapping theory on the plane + Fubini's theorem. Unfortunately this tactic does not work with $G$ because there is no foliation by transverse parallel planes. Note: Overhauled an earlier version of this question that was nonsense. 

$PGL_2(\mathbf{Z})$ is a Coxeter group with presentation $\langle s_1,s_2,s_3 \mid s_i^2=(s_1s_2)^3=(s_1s_3)^2=1 \rangle$, i.e. with labels $\{2,3,\infty\}$. To each Coxeter group $W$ with labels in $\{2,3,4,6,\infty\}$ there exists a Kac--Moody $G$ having a (twin) BN-pair with Weyl Group $W$, as constructed by J. Tits. In particular, $PGL_2(\mathbf{Z})$ is the Weyl group of a Kac-Moody group of rank 3. While the definition of a Kac-Moody group might appear quite technical, there are two ways of handwaving to convey a flavour of what a Kac-Moody group is like: (i) A semisimple complex Lie algebra has a nice presentation which can be written down from its Dynkin diagram. Using this presentation for more general Dynkin diagrams, one gets an infinite-dimensional complex Lie algebra $L$ generated by some generators $\langle e_i, f_i, h_i\rangle$. Then the associated adjoint complex Kac-Moody group is by definition the subgroup of Aut$(L)$ generated by ad$(t\cdot e_i)$, ad $(t\cdot f_i)$ for $t \in \mathbf C$. (ii) One can write down a presentation for $SL_n(\mathbf C)$ with generators the elementary matrices and certain relations which can be read off from the group's associated Dynkin diagram. Then a Kac-Moody group can similiarly be written down in terms of generators and relations for more general Dynkin diagrams. Caprace-Rémy's "Groups with a twin root datum" gives a very nice introduction to these matters. On the other hand, by Tits' famous classification of spherical buildings there do not exist thick buildings of types $H_3$ or $H_4$, hence no $BN$-pairs of this type, see e.g. this paper by R. Weiss. 

Suppose I have a uniformly Holder continuous plane field $H$ on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. I will assume that this plane field $H$ has many special properties, all of which are completely unreasonable to expect for a general such plane field $H$. These are summarized below, (1) There is a constant $C > 0$ such that for every $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $d(x,y) \leq 1$ ($d$ denoting Euclidean distance) there is a $C^1$ path $\gamma$ tangent to $H$ connecting $x$ to $y$ of length $ \leq C$. (2) There is a smooth uniformly expanding map $f: \mathbb{R}^{3} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$ which preserves $H$ (so we are free to dilate paths tangent to $H$). (3) There is a smooth $f$-invariant line field $V$ transverse to $H$. (4) Let $\rho$ be the path metric defined by taking $\rho(x,y)$ to be the infimal length of paths connecting $x$ to $y$ which are tangent to $H$. There is a locally finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that the metric measure space $(\mathbb{R}^{3}, \rho, \mu)$ is Ahlfors $Q$-regular for some $Q > 0$. There is one obvious way to construct such a plane field with the metric properties above, which is to take a $C^{1+Holder}$ diffeomorphic image of the 3-d Heisenberg group and take the image of the Carnot-Caratheodory metric defined by the horizontal contact distribution. My question: Through considering a different problem I encountered metric measure spaces of the type described above which are not (locally) quasisymmetric to the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group. I'm wondering if either (a): anyone has encountered any spaces like this before, or (b): conditions (1)-(4) impose any new nonobvious properties on the space. The most basic question that can be asked is whether the set of all rectifiable curves in this space $(\mathbb{R}^{3}, \rho, \mu)$ has positive $Q$-modulus, but this probably (maybe?) can't be shown without additional hypotheses. This may be too open-ended, but part of my problem is that I don't even know what questions one would necessarily want to ask and have answered about such spaces as well. Edit: Actually there is a second natural question here, which is whether it's possible that we could have $Q < 4$. Edit 2: I realized I could further point out the abundance/oddness of these spaces by the fact that they actually exist in 1-parameter families: for each $t \in (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$, $\varepsilon > 0$ small, there exists an $H_{t}$, $\rho_{t}$, $\mu_{t}$, $Q_{t}$ etc. continuously depending on $t$ such that at $t = 0$ you get the Heisenberg group with its standard Carnot-Caratheodory metric and none of these spaces are locally quasisymmetrically equivalent for distinct values of $t$. 

A group is said to satisfy the Tits alternative if every finitely generated subgroup of $G$ is either virtually solvable or contains a nonabelian free subgroup. Tits proved this for linear groups, and a MathSciNet search gives 38 papers with "Tits alternative" in the title (and 154 papers quoting Tits's original paper), so certainly a lot of groups do enjoy this property. What then is an example of a group which does not satisfy the Tits alternative? 

In Bridson's "A condition that prevents groups from acting nontrivially on trees" it is shown that for $n\geq 3$, $Aut (F_n)$ is generated by subgroups $A_1,A_2,A_3$ such that $\langle A_i,A_j \rangle$ is finite for $i,j=1,2,3$. This answers your question and moreover implies (via Helly's theorem) that for $n\geq 3$, any action of $Aut (F_n)$ on a tree fixes a point. Beautiful stuff! 

Just want to add that $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to $H:=\mathbb Z_p \ltimes_\varphi \mathbb Z^{p-1}$ where $\varphi(1)\cdot v=Av$ for some $A \in SL_{p-1}(\mathbb Z)$ of order $p$; in particular, $G$ is infinite. Indeed, such an $A$ exists: take $A$ to be a companion matrix to the polynomial $\frac{x^p-1}{x-1}$. Then any element in $H$ not contained in $ \{0\} \times \mathbb Z ^{p-1}$ has order $p$, so mapping $x$ to $(1,0)$ and $y$ to $(1,e_1)$ will give a well-defined homomorphism which can be shown to be surjective. 

Let $f,g \in \mathbf {C}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\subseteq \mathbf {C}[x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}]$ be two polynomials with complex coefficients and suppose that there exists $h_1 \in \mathop{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbf C)$ such that $h_1 \cdot f=g$. Does there exist $h_2 \in \mathop{GL}_n(\mathbf C)$ such that $h_2\cdot f=g$? This is a toy example of a more general question I'm interested in: given a family of representations $\rho_n: \mathop{GL}_n \to \mathop{End}(V_n)$ such that $V_n$ embeds naturally in $V_{n+1}$ (e.g., $V_n=\Lambda^r(\mathbf C^n)$), what can be said about the $\mathop{GL}_{n+1}$-orbits of elements of $V_n$? 

Let $(M,g)$ be an almost flat Riemannian manifold with boundary, i.e. we have $diam(M,g) \leq 1$ and curvature $K \ll 1$. Let's suppose $M$ is diffeomorphic to $N \times [0,1]$ for some smooth manifold $N$ with $\partial M \cong N \times \{0\} \sqcup N \times \{1\}$. Does the generic geodesic starting from one component of $\partial M$ eventually cross to the other component of $\partial M$ and thus exit the other side? Here I am parametrizing geodesics starting at one component of $\partial M$ by their entrance angle and asking for genericity in either the topological sense or the measure-theoretic Liouville volume sense. This came up because I'm constructing some Riemannian manifolds by gluing along almost flat pieces and carefully smoothing the metric, but I'm wondering if I actually need to be careful at all about this smoothing in order to get this crossing property. Edit: I'm open to taking a generic choice of almost flat metric as well, since some brief reflection suggests that the original formulation of the problem is likely false even for a cylinder... 

I have two quick questions that I've been having a hard time finding an answer to. Let $f^{t}: M \rightarrow M$ be a transitive Anosov flow on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$. (1) Let $\varphi: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a Holder continuous function. Is $\varphi$ cohomologous to a function $\psi$ on $M$ with $\psi(x) = \int_{0}^{1}\zeta(f^{s}x)ds$ for a Holder function $\zeta$? (2) The motivation for part (1): suppose that $\mu_{\varphi}$ is an equilibrium state for the time-one map $f^{1}$ with respect to $\varphi$. Is $\mu_{\varphi}$ the equilibrium state of some potential $\zeta$ for the full flow $f^{t}$? So to summarize, does working over the time-one map of an Anosov flow change anything when one looks at equilibrium states or potentials? I want to work with a potential over $f^{1}$ that's not obviously obtained by integrating along orbits. 

The standard representation of $\mathfrak {so}_n$ has dimension $n$, the adjoint representation has dimension $\frac 1 2 n \cdot (n-1)$ and there are two spin representations of small dimension. But I don't see a way how these, together with trivial representations, should add up to the dimension of $M$, which is $\frac 1 2 n \cdot (n+1)-1$. 

As explained by A. Sisto here on p.20 and p.21, "The subgroup generated by $z$ in the Heisenberg group $$〈 x,y,z | [ x,y ] = z, [ x,z ] = [ y,z ] = 1 〉$$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf Z$ and distorted." As $\langle z \rangle$ is the center of the Heisenberg group and hence normal, this gives one example. 

The answer is no, as expected. The following proof is "joint work" with L. Scheele. Consider $G=\mathbb{Z}$, $K=D_\infty$ and $H:=\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. Then $G \approx K$ and $K\approx H$, but $G \not\approx H.$ Indeed, the Cayley graph associated to $\{-1,1\}$ for G and the Cayley graph associated to $\{s,t\}$ where $D_\infty=\langle s,t: s^2=t^2=1 \rangle$ are clearly isometric. Similarly, the Cayley graph associated to $\{s,st,ts\}$ for $K$ and the graph associated to $\{(0,1),(-1,0),(1,0)\}$ for $H$ are isometric. However, let $S$ be some symmetric generating set for $G$. Then $S_k$, the set of vertices which have distance precisely $k\geq 1$ from the identity, has even cardinality because $S_k$ is invariant under the mapping $x \mapsto -x$ and doesn't contain 0. Now let $T$ be some symmetric generating set for $H$. Let $k_0$ be the distance of $(0,1)$ from the identity in the associated graph. Then $T_{k_0}$, the set of vertices which have distance precisely $k_0$ from the identity, has odd cardinality. Indeed, it is invariant under the mapping $(x,y) \mapsto (-x,-y)$ since $T$ is assumed to be symmetric. But $(0,1)$ is a fixed point.
