Your question enters the field of psychology of religion. We know that patients with psychosis hear voices and feel the presence of other persons who pursue them. In addition they speak to these imaginary people. This observation shows that certain people feel the presence of other persons even when there are no other persons around. These observations raise the question how to discriminate between psychosis and religion, the latter understood as communication with a personal, but invisible being, e.g. with the Jewish and Christian god, with Jesus Christ, with Maria, or with a series of Christian saints. I consider the demarcation a difficult task. 

Kant elaborates his metaphysics of natural science in Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (German: Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft) (1786) He writes: 

I would like to illustrate the main difference between deductive and inductive reasoning by the following two standard examples: 1) All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Hence Socrates is mortal. The premiss covers more than the conclusion. If the premiss is true, then also the conclusion is true. That's the typical deductive reasoning from logic. 2) Up to now all observed swans are white. Hence all swans are white. That's the typical inductive reasoning. It attempts to derive from a set of cases a general conclusion. Inductive reasoning is not validated by any type of logic. The present example shows why: Some time after making this reasoning, black swans have been detected in Australia. Hence the conclusion is false. Deductive reasoning is successfully applied in all sciences where proofs are possible, i.e. in mathematics and in logic itself. Inductive reasoning is applied in all natural sciences. It serves to form general hypotheses, but it cannot prove them. Added. The inductive reasoning in the Jennifer-example is: Up to know Jennifer was always on time at school when leaving at 7. Hence also in the future, she will be on time when leaving at 7. The conclusion does not hold due to several possible reasons, e.g. due to a change of the bus schedule. Nevertheless, the inductive reasoning gives a plausible hypothesis. 

May I substitute one word in your question before answering? Scientist do not consider belief in science the right stance on science. Because science does not operate neither by revelation nor by certification by witnesses. Hence I would like to change your question to 

No, logic is not subjective. In all mathematical theories all experts obtain consensus about the validity of the theorems of an axiomatized theory. But the theories differ and sometimes the Pros/Cons of a theory are debated. E.g., there are two-valued logics and many-valued logic and fuzzy logic and etc. It's not the question about the validitiy of the theorems of the theory. At most it is a question which axioms should be taken as beginning. It is an insight of the last 200 years that axioms cannot be derived from any foregoing insights, neither intuitive insights nor from results of scientific discoveries. Which axioms to choose may depend on observation. But axioms do not derive from observation like theorems derive from axioms. Instead it is often a question of usefulness which axioms should be chosen to develop a mathematical theory which fits as the foundation of a scientific theory. E.g., there was a discussion whether classical 2-valued logic is suitable for the interpretation of measurements on the quantum level. Logic is not fundamental in the sense that there is excatly one calculus of logic. But it is fundamental in the sense that every rational argumentation, in particular any scientific theory, presupposes a certain calculus of logic. 

I know the German edition and I assume both editions have the same text. There are eight chapters, e.g., Space, time matter; philosophy of the Theory of Relativity; the challenge of Quantum Physics; causality and laws of nature. The book does not cover modern speculations and work in progress, neither different approaches to quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, nor speculations about multiverses. Herefore I recommend the series of books by 

Any x has an inverse -x with respect to addition, i.e. x + (-x) = 0. Hence with respect to addition, x and -x are symmetric. 

The third part of this work, named Metaphysical Foundations of Mechanics, contains the following propositions: 

Nietzsche considers Plato boring due to his style of writing in his dialogues. But Nietzsche's rejection of Plato goes deeper and is based on the content of Plato's philosophy, see the quote. The quote above partly supports your first proposal. But it does not support your proposals two and three. 

If such being would not exist, it were not the greatest being, because existence increases magnitude. Today only a minority accepts his reasoning as a valid proof. Already his contemporary Gaunilo pointed out the weakness of the argument. Kant rejected Anselm’s argument by stating: Existence is not a property which increases the scope of a concept. Hence my answer to your question: Nothing can be derived about an object from the fact that I can think about the object. The domain of thoughts and the real world are two ontological different domains. 

In general "to be" is not an autonomous but an auxiliary verb. It links a noun with a property. The latter can - but need not - denote a state. Hence "to be" denotes a relation between two objects, it is considered a copula. Autonomous verbs denote an action either in active or passive form. A limiting case are verbs like "to sleep" or "to lie on the ground". "To be" in the meaning "to exist" is the only use of "to be" as an autonomus verb. It took some time in the European philosophy of language until the two different types of "to be" were clearly separated. Even some passages in the late works of Plato mix both meanings, which led to philosophical pseudo problems. The first European philosopher who investigated in a systematical way the use and the different meanings of "to be" (Greek einai) was Aristotle in his The Categories. 

1) An invalid argument may have a true conclusion: Consider the invalid argument: "Because Socrates is mortal, all humans are mortal." Nevertheless the conclusion is true: "All humans are mortal." 2) An invalid argument may have a false conclusion: Because Socrates is Greek, all humans are Greek. 3) A valid argument may have a false conclusion: Because all humans live in Africa, also Socrates lives in Africa. (this kind of valid argument is named "ex falso quodlibet") 4) A valid argument may have a true conclusion: Because all humans are mortal, also Socrates is mortal.
