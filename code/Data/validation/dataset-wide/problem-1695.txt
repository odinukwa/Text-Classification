The headers are either going to be sent from apache if you have configured specific values for file types or from your backend either in code or from the backend HTTP server. Those cache control headers would appear to be defaults, which would suggest nothing is being explicitly set. What is delivering the content? I have to admit I had to look up mod_cache_socache but it wouldn't appear to set headers at all. Having a look at 'willingness', documentation suggests that it may be related to your backend not providing modification dates or hashes or other indicators of freshness. Also don't get confused with the front end headers and the cache content. Without knowing much more my guess would be that you need a bit of granularity in your caching rules and in your front end header rules. 

Are the wildcard certificates from the same issuer? On the evidence it would look like you don't have a valid CA for Comodo. In your apache configuration you would usually have settings for SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateChainFile so check that. 

I would tend to recommend running as the system user, so in your case, and as a non-privileged user, which can be the same as the shell user. You don't have to have your non-privileged user in the group as passes requests to . for execution. The setup suggested by the Magento docs assumes and , which would require the permissions setup as described above. 

Configuration files are loaded in filename order and parsed internally so after the load at startup are accessed through a hash, so it doesn't really make a lot of difference in my experience. I would tend to keep VirtualHosts in a domain together so would name the virtual hosts for the domain. 

Your DNS hasn't been updated correctly. Use something like IntoDNS to analyse how your domains are resolving and any problems arising from this. 

Firstly check the python application as it could be out of date and is probably misreading the version. CentOS shows the base version as installed and is patched to keep up with changes and it could just be a case of fixing the version that is being looked for in the code as a quick fix, but if the application is being actively developed you need to let the developers know or fork it for yourself if you can. An up to date on CentOS 7 should be If it's absolutely necessary to run this application, the official RHEL approach would be to containerise, but you would still need to provide a working glibc, which wouldn't be possible with stock CentOS 7. If this isn't viable, and as an absolute last resort, it is possible to install a newer version of than 2.18 as that is five years old now and has been updated for several vulnerabilities and I'm not sure off the top of my head if it will build with the version of in CentOS 7, but any newer version should work as follows: ++++ This can potentially affect the functionality of your computer so make sure you know what you are doing ++++ You can build the version of you require elsewhere on your server and add it to for the application. Note this must only be done for the application only. 

It's a wholly personal/commercial decision. If you run your nameservers on the ISPConfig and cPanel servers (which I personally don't like but it's the default setup) then you will presumably be serving domains from each system separately, but if you are offering a unified product then having nameservers in the same domain is a useful, if cosmetic, detail. 

It's almost certainly going to be restrictions on the hotel network or upstream. If you haven't got a usable phone signal you may not be able to do much. If you could get to somewhere with a less restrictive policy you may be able to make changes but again it could be chance. Your best option in that case would probably be to open SSH on port 443 if you're not using HTTPS as that is unlikely to be blocked. 

and this is a simple setup for a reverse proxy which can be added to a or a (official documentation:$URL$ 

In the standard and design checks for the existence of a file and then sends the file path to over a TCP/IP or unix socket for execution so needs to be able to see the file - is the file server whether the file is a static html file or a script, and is the processor in this case. 

usually connects to the process on the server on port 5666 or using on port 2098, so you would need to open whichever port you are using in your AWS security groups. If you can only allow access from your home IP that would improve security a little. Also check that is listening on or the internal IP of the instance rather that . 

However, this will reject or or blacklist a message with a response, and you may not want the sender to know that it is being rejected. You may also only want the mail to be rejected for a particular user, in which case I would suggest using or a policy server. Procmail is powerful but can be hard to get into. Postfix's architecture means that an external server, even plain may do what you require. 

if the first command doesn't show a downgrade path. As always, test this before doing it on a production machine. 

Nginx also provides and weighted connections (there is also for session persistence) so your backends can be configured like this: 

PHP will be using an additional repository, usually IUS or Remi, so it is likely that you need to install the package. 

Two things come to mind: Can your lsyncd process read the exclude file? You should be able to see this in the status log. Also, have no blank lines in the exclude file as that gets interpreted as 'exclude all'. 

If you look at $URL$ you will see that the nameservers are not responding for the domain so it needs to be dealt with by the hosting provider: 

SSL certificates verify the domain or hostname, not the IP address. However, most web servers and browsers now support Server Name Indication (SNI) and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) which means you don't need a second IP address. For that matter you don't need to buy certificates any more. LetsEncrypt Certbot provides Domain Verification certificates for multiple domains for free. 

The answer in this case seems to have been that the support system sends mails with duplicate IDs, one for the message, and one for the change of ticket status, and Zimbra's default action is not to deliver duplicate mails. The answer was therefore to run 

The 403 error in the page is coming from a web beacon at Vimeo and the error indicates that it doesn't have permission to post to the service. I would guess that the beacon is linked to the video on the page. 

'Terminate' in this case is where the client request is received and forwarded to the application front end. The application returns its response, which is then sent as the response to the client, so it's correct to say that the query from your browser only reaches GFE in your diagram as the TCP packets are rewritten to pass into Google's network, being directed to the requested application. 

BIND's logging is usually good by default although you don't mention what OS you are using but it does normally show any configuration errors. A common issue is that it's configured to listen on localhost, which I think is the default so you may need it to listen on an interface. You can test from your desktop with nslookup in a cmd window with which should show if your server is responding at all. You could also use a forwarding DNS server instead so you would need to configure forwarders in your BIND configuration. This guide may help. 

Look at . This should do what you need, possibly with a bit of scripting. A more advanced option would be something like Splunk or graylog. 

You have a lot of conflicting configuration here. I would suggest creating a for and and another for and/or *.cms.domain.com with the . There is also precedence in so domain.com should be last. The easiest way out of the common config issue is to symlink to each directory and then you at least have consistency. 

but it's worth reading up on that or testing your sites with Google Sitespeed or similar and following the recommendations there. You can also enabled compression if it isn't - the settings are in but may need enabling for file types. Nginx doesn't actually cache: static files are served from memory and the mechanism is quite flexible but you may have to look at your application delivery. There is a plugin for nginx in front of Wordpress that expires the cache and this can be useful. Buffering is about the response from the backend and while the default settings are good and flexible you may have to tweak a little if you are seeing timeouts at the front end, especially if your backend is outside of your local network, but don't do anything unless you have to. If you are using pretty URLs with Wordpress using on your backend, you can stay with that. That's about as much as SEO means with regard to nginx in your setup. 

root can't receive mail using postfix and dovecot can't deliver it over IMAP. It's not really a great idea to use Unix users for authentication for that matter and there are plenty of ways of setting up virtual mail using postfix and dovecot. If you really need to test, create a non-privileged user, which should work. 

It's unlikely that the load balancer is going to send out mail so the origin address is probably still going to be 1.1.1.1 - from the point of view of postfix mail will usually be coming from the primary IP of the web server unless it has been configured otherwise. 

It is becoming increasingly difficult to establish and maintain reputation for standalone mail servers when dealing with the large mail providers. Among the things you have to consider are whether your server, or IP address or indeed netblock are on RBLs, which can be a legacy issue from previous users of the address. Also ensure that your configuration matches your IP address, particularly that your HELO address resolves to the sending IP address. Zimbra itself can be hard to debug for inbound mail so turn on logging in the setup stage. 

Put simply, Google doesn't allow this directly unless you use GSuite. However, you can send and receive mail from an another address through Gmail as long as it has an existing POP3 or IMAP account from Settings | Accounts and Import | Send mail as: and Check email from other accounts:. Set up a mailbox using Godaddy and it will still get all the benefits of Gmail. 

Such strings can often be exploit tests but if they are coming from legitimate sources, by which I assume they are addresses that are known to you, they could be some kind of port check or a keepalive process from an application - would that make sense in this context? 

The process is documented by AWS here. In short, you would have to convert your image into a virtual machine disk and upload it to AWS using the command line tools.
