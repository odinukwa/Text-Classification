Intuitively, this type of Euclidean pseudo compactification would only work for countable ordinals such as ωω, pictured here. One can (almost) imagine extending this picture to a higher countable ordinal by replacing each ordinal in this depiction with a copy of ωω to obtain something like ωω2 perhaps(?) (I'm not sure). Imagining further substitutions beyond that, things become less clear. The first uncountable ordinal ( ω1 ) would be at the "limit of the limit of the limit ..." of this process - if that makes any sense. This sort of doodling is fun, but unfortunately it does not say anything about the formal, topological view of compactness among the ordinals. 

TL;DR The Concordance Model is a recent formulation, coming to be the theory of choice as recently as the late 1990s following the unexpected observations of the accelerating rate of expansion of the universe and the "rotational flat curve" features of galaxies. It is an extension of the existing big bang model obtained by adding two auxiliary hypotheses - dark energy (Λ) and cold dark matter (CDM), hence the designation ΛCDM. The observation of an accelerating expansion rate led to the dark energy hypothesis, while the unexpected galactic rotational characteristics observed led us to the dark matter hypothesis. The philosophical considerations of rational choice and Bayesean arguments led us to adding two auxiliary hypotheses to our existing, well supported model (up until then) rather than adopting a radical new model or making ad hoc modifications to our existing model. 

where those situations left of s(0) are before and those to the right are after. Here, we have P(h) is true in any given situation s only if it is true in some situation to the left of s. Similarly, F(h) is true in a given situation s only if it is true in some situation to the right of s. Recall that McTaggart's argument was that, given that h has every possible tense, it is never possible to avoid contradiction. Resolving contradictions in one level of complexity for compound tenses only creates the contradictions in the next level of compound tenses. So how do we resolve this. Suppose that our instantaneous event h is true only at s(0). Then any statement with compound tenses on h is true somewhere. For example, consider F(P(P(F(h)))). This is true at s(-2). 

Consider your first scenario. You question if an instantaneous state can lead to good outcomes. The answer a Consequentialist will tell you is no. There are no good outcomes where time for reasoning is not allowed. Consider your second and third scenario (which are inverse propositions). A consequentialist will tell you it depends. The length of time do not affect the amount of possible outcomes, because the possible inputs are infinite at any point of time. Thus, at any point of time, use the greatest possible information that are relevant to the consideration in mind. Keep in mind the difference between 2 things. There is the point of time in which you choose as your 'function'. And there is the amount of inputs, which ranges. However, at any one point of time, you are given only one set of inputs and a specific evaluative criteria, taken from the point of view of an actor. If in that shorter period of time leads to worser outcomes than the longer period of time, both using the same set of criteria to evaluate the value of outcomes, then a Consequentialst will not go ahead with that action. Again, it depends on what criteria you use to evaluate the outcomes. Some consequentialists will say it is greater happiness, some will say it is greater security. Your outcome will depend on this evaluative criteria. If the consequences in the longer period of time justifies and overrides the negative consequences in the shorter period of time, then the consequentialist will go ahead with it. Consider your fourth scenario. You consider groups. You cannot simply add the inputs together because the evaluative criteria (the equation) changes. How would a consequentialist deal with this? Ignore the individual actors totally and consider the group. Determine the evaluative criteria and inputs possible for this group that you choose, and draw the function. You will get the answer. The questions you raise are not new to Consequentialism as a moral theory. There are mainly two types: 'Act' and 'Rule'. Act consequentialism says that the rightness of the act depends on what the individual knows at that point of time, and choose optimally upon. Rule consequentialism says that it is the group's, or more complete information, that should determine the rightness of acts. This is the subjectivist vs. objectivist concern. 

When considering a mathematical result it is important to place all terms in the correct context. Cantor's diagonal argument is a method of proof, so it does not "conclude" anything. It is neither a paradox nor a theorem. The diagonal argument is used to prove a theorem that states R is not equinumerous with N. Diagonalization is a well-defined, mathematically sound procedure. The justification for concluding that |R| > |N| is that it has been thus proven in a mathematically rigorous way. Cantor's result can be proven in ways that employ neither diagonalization nor the reductio-ad-absurdum method. Diagonalization is the popular method of proof because it is the most elegant and intuitively clear. Cantor originally proved the result using an different reductio argument involving nested intervals. An example of a non-reductio proof is given by what is called The Measurement Argument. Aside : Russell's paradox is a logical (formal) paradox and one could say that it gives rise to a theorem, namely that the cumulative hierarchy (the collection of all sets) is not itself a set. This would not be a theorem of set theory since set theory only deals with sets, but it could be considered a theorem of mathematics in general. EDIT (Sep 11, '13): When I say that the diagonal argument is a method of proof and so does not conclude anything, I mean to point out that the diagonal argument is an argument used to prove dozens, if not hundreds of mathematical results in many areas of mathematics. Further, it may not be fair to say that the Measurement Argument is a non-reductio proof of Cantor's result. While the actual proof is non-reductio, it does rely on Measure Theory. Precisely, the proof shows that any countable set has zero measure. However, it may be that those measure-theoretic results which allow us to say that an uncountable set has non-zero measure may themselves currently have only reductio proofs. Finally, the context of Cantor's result is Set Theory. Set Theory uses classical logic. If you wish to apply a logic which rejects the Law of the Excluded Middle to argue the proof is not valid, fine. But this does not invalidate Cantor's result as a result from Set Theory. 

There are some truly superb answers to this question and I feel somewhat under read to contribute but I feel like there's been one point that has not been mentioned in the answers and that is the question of the very nature of right and wrong. From what I can tell from having listened to some of these same debates, the problem posed by the theists, is not that God has any distinct advantage in knowing right and wrong or choosing it (as some form of dictator might) but is the very definition and source of right and the antithesis of wrong. This may seem like splitting hairs but I'll try and explain what I mean. When we talk about what is good or bad, we have presupposed ideas on what that is. In an argument we might say that something is not fair and we presuppose that the other person agrees with our definition of fair. The problem is, where did our notion of fair or right and wrong come from. The traditional atheistic view, as far as I understand it, is either that it comes from societal norms (my family background and culture) or that there is a higher principal of what benefits us as a whole or that it simply is what is good/bad for me as an individual. I believe that the theistic view has objections to each of these. First the personal view (what's good/bad for me) doesn't give any basis for altruism or any basis for justice - how can you condemn someone for an action they perform if there is no basis for right and wrong that exists outside of the individual - that's every man for himself. Second, the higher principal of society as a whole would have to come from some kind of evolutionary process - we would have to evolve a sense of 'benefiting the whole community being better than purely pleasing myself' over time and seeing the way we all fair better together. This is probably the strongest possibility but it gets very thorny on issues like caring for the elderly or the severely disabled in the community - on a pure survival basis, they do not bring benefit to the community and so the debate over euthanasia voluntary or otherwise would be moot. Third the cultural view - again, this seems to work in some ways but what happens when a society or culture decide that it's right to do something most would consider wrong. How can you condemn a large group in this sense. Basically, the objection boils down to if right and wrong is defined by the majority in a society then we have no basis on which to condemn Nazi Germany and the actions perpetrated in that time by that group. The theistic view is that it has the advantage because most atheistic views tend toward some cost/benefit model and that usually ends up presenting problems when it comes to judgement. However, if you have God as the definition of right and wrong (as has been said, right is what God is like, wrong is what God is not like) then you have a basis for all right and wrong choices. It's not so much a reward basis - you'll get some good stuff if you do what God says, as much as it's the nature of the universe that God created. The question of what if God decided it was good for people to murder or God's nature included murder, has a logical flaw in it. In the theistic view that we're discussing (espoused by John Lennox or CS Lewis for example), the definition of good comes from who God is as he is the creator of everything. If God's nature was such that he created a universe where murder was good how would we have any ability to tell that it was wrong? What basis would we have to say it was not good? In that case, you're back to a personal view of right and wrong in which, it's what benefits me or society the most and you suppose that you are a better being than God. In that case, God is no longer God and the argument breaks down. You're right to suggest that that would make God some kind of weird dictator but that's all he would be. 

As Bardon notes, Kant has been roundly criticized for this view. Bardon summarises Kant’s position as follows : 

When considering questions such as this, it is useful to keep in mind Frege's ontology { concept, object, name }. Everything is considered as being in these three categories. We give an object a name (denotation), here P. In turn, the object has a concept (or sense). If you are familiar with modern computer languages (object-oriented programming), then this should be natural to you as the ontology { class, object, name }, where the object is a named instance of the class. On the other hand, in a different context both object and name are concepts which can be instantiated as an object with a name. So it is important to keep context in mind. 

In Wissenschaft der Logik (variously translated as The Science of Logic or The Acquirement of Logic) Hegel states that his dialectical method is "the only true method" of scholarly and scientific exposition. From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - 

You then say "As per my understanding, infinity is fully formed, perfectly symmetrical". This is not entirely correct. Certainly those sets formed by the three principles are fully formed in the sense of being well-defined. However, in the case of infinite sets, these sets are not symmetrical since, for example, there is a smallest whole number but no greatest whole number. Other infinite sets may have a least member and a greatest member, but "in between" there are subsets with no greatest member. It is also important to understand that our intuition of the infinite extends beyond those well-formed sets generated by the three principles to what Cantor called the absolute infinite. These collections are not well-formed. These are inconsistent infinities such as the collection of all well-formed sets. The inconsistency of this collection is witnessed by Russell's famous paradox. 

Empirically, no. In our imaginations, yes. That is essentially what you have referred to in the conception by children from images and symbols which seem to refer to their existence. You cannot prove an ideal conception conceived purely from objects situated in reality. For one could almost conceive of any imaginary object if we put them together. Consider what David Hume says, that there is a difference between 'matters of fact' and 'relations of ideas', in Chapter 4 in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. To simplify, matters of fact are things that, no matter what word we assign to it, are true in this world because they exist. They are established by evidence, which in turn are presaged upon 'cause and effect'. Relations of ideas are when, based on certain ideas we hold in our mind, establish them to be true by the mere thought of it. This includes mathematical and geometrical ideas, but also ideas we put together from different 'matters of fact'. That is, things that we hold true from evidence. So Santa Claus is a combination of many ideas from evidence put together as an imaginary whole. The idea of a man in a red costume, with his moose and a some 'human' looking elves, are taken from real life. We distort this picture by making this man and his moose fly, jumping into the chimneys of houses, carrying a host of goods into them (even apartments without chimneys), and give him a sense of humor. This is the imaginary picture we transmit to children, through word-of-mouth and images we draw and enact, therefore to them, there is a possibility that this imaginary figure is real, given that the empirical evidence was not told to them truthfully, but turned into a festive season made real.
