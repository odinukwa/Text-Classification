Olympia bicycles are as good as any, and the company has been doing for about 100 years longer than any you mention. Having said that Olympia produce good bikes, they have a different brand for pro-level equipment: Scapin, one of which I am privileged to ride. I gave an Olympia to my brother-in-law, three years ago. He's been riding it 500 km per month ever since without problems. 

Feel free to edit this answer to add more resources. Hand cycling is a Paralympic sport, administered by the UCI. There are links at the bottom of the UCI page for all world regions. Here is a link for Disabled Sports USA, describing different kinds of bikes and listing local chapters and a bunch of useful links. The United States Handcycle Federation seems to be mainly about competition. Cycling Australia has a Para-Cycling page, there is the Queensland Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association, and Wheelchair Sport NSW. I'm sure there are bodies in each state, but a quick search didn't locate them. Good luck! 

There are more kinds; some people might put CX bikes in their own category, some might insist that fatbikes or 36ers should be in the list. But I digress. Bikes, like any consumer item, lose a lot of value the moment you pay for them and take them home. So when you have tight budget or are not sure what you want / need, buying a used bike is a sensible option. The more you use it, the more uses you can find. It's OK to own more than one bike. As with any significant purchase when you're not sure of the technical details, I recommend reading up (as you have done, and this question is part of that). Then shop around, asking every question you can think of, including ones you think you know the answer for. Ask open questions, where the salesperson has to explain, not "I want to use it for shopping, so I'll need panniers, right?". This way you can cross-check their answers with their competitors and your own knowledge. When there is a difference, ask more to work out if they just have a different opinion to the last person, if they know more than you or the last person, or they are full of bull. I'm looking for a good price, but mainly good service. When I need assistance I want to know where I can get it, which is why I recommend a local bike shop (not online). So this doesn't answer all the details of your question. Each kind of bike has it's intended use, and does that pretty well. Each kind has drawbacks when you go beyond it's intended uses. You can get too deep into details, such as tire width, number of gears, type of brakes, frame geometry, blah blah. My advice is to be clear on you want it for, and get a bike that matches that. If you're not clear on the use, then you need a more general purpose bike. 

The only generalization that holds for the 16k users here is that we like to give and receive advice about cycling. Many people have their specializations, and some always have something to say. It's like any small community. As with any community you join, it's a good idea to quietly scout around for a while to get a feel for how the community works before criticizing. Most people have to adjust a bit to fit in to any new community. Some people can't adjust and move on. If that's you then good luck. If you choose to hang about, then I suggest that you just quietly watch how things work for a while. Asking good questions actually takes effort (and I haven't mastered that art yet). Answering is much easier. Every now and then you'll see a question where you think can contribute. Every time you do, you'll learn more about how the place works. 

In many cities, doing a 35 km (22 mi) commute will take you through parts of the city with different socioeconomic levels and different driver behaviors. Cyclist behavior that works well in one part of the city can lead to road rage in another place. It's valuable to recognize this and adapt your approach at different parts of your commute. Some years ago, my commute took me through some quiet streets of a well-to-do suburb of mostly older residents. It took a few interactions, where a driver would look right at me and then apparently try to run me down, for me to realize that they simply didn't see me. They were looking for cars. It's like These are not the 'Droids you're looking for. They are looking for cars, not bikes. Knowing the area you're riding from, I would describe it (for other readers) as rural / urban interface. There are new developments, and little infrastructure. Roads become congested early, and stay congested late. It's also Winter here now, so it's often only half-light or dark when commuting. Because of the ongoing development there is a higher than usual number of tradesmen (tradies) driving utes (pickups for US readers) and commercial vehicles. Their focus is on getting to their current job. It's not an area where I would choose to ride. So, either recognize the local conditions and adapt to them in a safe way, or find another route. Another route may not seem practical, but on a 35km commute, a safer route that involves a 3km detour will not be much slower (it may even be quicker), and could save you hospital time in the future. You could maybe drive a short distance to the start of your safer route. Another change you could make is to use a helmet-mounted light. They shine where you look. So when you look, the drivers are more likely to notice you. Be careful not to get one that's too bright though. If you dazzle the driver then they actually can't see you. 

The full answer is it depends, as Chris has commented. If it is really a country road, you can also encounter farm animals as they are being moved, or farm machinery (or it can encounter you). This can happen on any day of the week, as can the other kinds of traffic. In general the only category that might be expected to decline is commercial trucking on a Sunday. You don't mention if you are in the UK; if so, a reconnaissance trip could be worth it. Another source of information would be local cycle touring clubs or groups. 

In my experience, kids don't realise that they have to push hard at the start. It seems obvious (even "intuitive") to us, but not to them. On the balance bike, one can just push along gently, but this new bike is bigger and heavier, and the gearing makes it harder. So my advice is to encourage him with an enthusiastic "push hard" call. Or go further and tell him to stand on the pedal. I solved this problem in a different way: I built my son's bike with a gear cluster at the back (no derailleur) with the chain on the easiest gear. As he got stronger, I gradually moved the chain across one cog at a time. The main thing is to have fun with them. 

All the elite riders I have encountered just know. I think its part of the attention to detail necessary at that level. You almost never see them looking down to check (that would be showing a weakness and giving oponents an opportunity). But if you mean can the rider say which cog they are using at the front and rear? then the answer is that often we can't say. Usually we know by memory which front cog we are using. And as I change the rear gear, I know by the different feel of the ratio whether I'm near the top, the middle, or the bottom of the cluster. I very rarely try to change gears past the last one. The bike knows. That's enough. 

For such a trip I strongly recommend a purpose built touring bike. Because of the loads you'll carry and the climbs, it must have some quite low gears. Most people would need to able to stay seated on 5-7% grades with the bike fully loaded. Some of the passes have sections of over 10%, so the lower gears will definitely help there. Plenty of people use internal gear hubs for touring, sometimes with extra chain rings, so go your own way there. Just make sure you've got those low gears. The bike should have drop bars to give you more variety in your riding position, and it should have relaxed geometry, so that it's nice and stable under the load. For just one tour, I don't think it matters whether the frame is steel or aluminium. What matters more IMO is that you get a week or two of riding the bike you'll take for your body acclimatise to it's particular fit. Two well-fitted bikes still feel different and under load and long kms a new bike can cause aches, pains, and even injuries. So ride it before you go, starting with short rides and increasing to 100km. The hardest thing to advise on is distance per day. On the one hand, planning to average 200km per day sounds huge. On the other hand you say you've done those distances before on a MTB. Are you as fit as you were then? Most serious cyclists would be happy with 100-150km per day, or less as we get older. So the strongest advise I would give is to plan conservatively, be flexible, and plan some rest days. In that part of the world I would carry spare tubes, a puncture repair kit, and a few tools. But not too much; you are never far from assistance. Sounds like a great adventure! Enjoy :-) 

Since you say that you have not mastered standing on the pedals, you will find this requires practice, away from the traffic and hills. It's the same for most beginners. You will notice as you learn that you'll nearly always wobble about as you start. You'll find that you wobble less as you improve, and also that you can predict the amount of wobble. The wheel "tilting" can be because you are not leaning the bike toward the foot that's on the ground when you're stationary. As you push your body forward, you will be moving your weight slightly across over the wheels, which will cause the bike to stand up straight. Advanced technique With this method, you stand to one side of the bike, with your hands on the handlebars, and your feet behind the bottom bracket. Let's say you're on the right side of the bike. Adjust the pedals so that the right pedal is at the 12 o'clock position (yep, higher than the basic method). Put you right foot on the right pedal, and push forward as you stand on the pedal. To get more speed you can push and hop with your left foot a couple of times. Swing your left leg over the bike, bringing your left foot onto the pedal as it reaches the top. Cheerfully ride away. Hope that helps. Enjoy. 

Mountain bikes weren't invented last time I had this problem. Since you're already covered in mud, wipe much of it off with your hands. Be careful to keep fingers out of the parts that bite. Use a stick where it's dangerous to poke your fingers, and get mud out of the derailleurs. Depending on the kind of mud, and water availability
