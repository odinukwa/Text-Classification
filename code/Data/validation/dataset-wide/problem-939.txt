Nappes and thrust sheets are very similar terms. I agree with definition found on wikipedia: (except for the 2 km requirement of movement, I would replace 2 km with significant distance. I am sure you still have a Nappe with only 1.5 km of movement is measured.) In geology, a nappe or thrust sheet is a large sheetlike body of rock that has been moved more than 2 km (1.2 mi) or 5 km (3.1 mi) above a thrust fault from its original position. Nappes form in compressional tectonic settings like continental collision zones or on the overriding plate in active subduction zones. Nappes form when a mass of rock is forced (or "thrust") over another rock mass, typically on a low angle fault plane. The resulting structure may include large-scale recumbent folds, shearing along the fault plane, imbricate thrust stacks, fensters and klippe. 

Although scheelite can be found in the granites of North Carolina, it is relatively rare. Scheelite is usually very fluorescent (glowing bright blue under short wave UV light). 

From purely physical examination from the photo, crystal morphology and luster appears most likely be calcite (85% chance). You would need an HCL acid test to confirm. Less likely, the mineral might be fluorite (10% chance). If you can provide a specific location, country, state\province, county, there is a significantly smaller probability that the mineral might be something more unusual than calcite or fluorite (5% chance). I have collected calcite specimens that have the exact shape and luster as shown in the photo. 

21.7%, by my calculations (338 / 1556 holocene-active volcanoes). I calculated perennial snow by combining 6 weeks of MOD10A2 data from winter and summer weeks in 2014 to figure out which pixels had snow both in the summer and the winter. My source code for that is available as a gist (an older version accidentally classified cloud as snow; that's been fixed). Then I checked if these pixels fell within 10km of the volcanoes in the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Database. I also plotted the woefully incomplete Global Land Ice Measurements from Space glacier polygons. There are clearly a few false-positives on ocean islands... I think this is due to MOD10A2 marking choppy surf as snow. Looking into that. I intend to publish this and will put a reference here if it is published. Here's what the map looks like for part of Alaska: 

Because of the Coriolis Effect, the prevailing winds on the earth between about the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer go from the East to the West (knows as the Trade Winds). To get to the west coast of a continent within those latitudes, an air mass blowing from above an ocean must cross the entire continent. Along the way, the air mass causes precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) and loses water so by the time it reaches the west coast the air tends to be very dry and average annual precipitation will be very low. "Rain shadow" is a related effect in which the lee side of mountain ranges are dry because air masses experience orographic rainfall when they encounter the mountain range. This causes the Atacama desert to the west of the Andes, and the Mojave to the east of the Sierra Nevada. Note that the Mojave is east of the Sierra Nevada rather than west because the prevailing wind direction is westerly (from west to east) because it is north of Capricorn. Bear in mind that this explanation is extremely approximate and oversimplified, and that your assumption of deserts on the western side of a continent should be reversed north of about Capricorn and South of about Cancer, where the Trade Winds are replaced by the Westerlies. 

Based on the stats for the US only, I would say we have the capacity for using fossil fuels over the next 100 years. Whether or not we worry about it is another discussion entirely. The US has coal resources for the next 250 years and I suspect may be producing and using natural gas for the next 100 years. For the US (from the US Energy Information Administration) 

Your rock is mostly anthracite coal. You best diagnostic test is density. Coal even anthracite is generally the least dense rock that has no visible porosity. As for the colors, coal typically shows a large range of surface sheen colors but due a number of impurities like complex organic compounds and metal sulfides. 

It looks like a piece of chert and maybe related to nearby limestone formation. What state/province and country did you find it in and where (in a stream, along a road or railroad, or hiking trailing? 

Aragonite crystal cluster most likely from Morocco. Nice specimen btw. Google: aragonite spherical crystal clusters. 

To get maximum value, you need to clean the specimens, and if you have the tools and patience, carefully trim the specimens as needed. I use eBay as a loose guide for going prices on mineral specimens. Double terminated 

The previous answers contain important facts, but neglect recent discoveries. As tobias47n9e says, the increase in observed output over time is an observational effect. As kaberett explains, if you're talking about megayear timescales, Large Igneous Provinces will have a large impact on the timeseries. However, LIP and all continental eruptions (~1km^3 / year) are dwarfed by midocean ridge seafloor eruptions (~3km^3 / year). Volcanologists have made major progress towards answering your question (are production rates trending? periodic?) over the last few years. We've learned that: 

Looks like a chunk of quartz. Please re-write the question following A guide for asking "Identify this rock" questions? . 

On p. 6 of this article: Bliss, A.K., Cuffey, K.M., Kavanaugh, J.L., 2011. Sublimation and surface energy budget of Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. Journal of Glaciology 57, 684â€“696. There is an expression for sublimation rate as a function of latent heat flux $L$ and (specific) latent heat of sublimation (of water ice) $\lambda$. 

The Glen flow law for glaciers is a common relationship linking stress to strain. At its simplest, $\Sigma = k\tau^n$ where $\tau$ is stress, $\Sigma$ is strain, and $n$ is roughly 3. I understand that $k$ depends on temperature and material properties of the ice, and that it can vary over two or three orders of magnitude. I have been searching the literature to find some example values of $k$ (also called $B$ and $A$) but so far I've had a surprisingly hard time. Is there somewhere that has a compilation of $k$ values from various studies? 

In textbooks it is mentioned that Magnetic anomaly = Observed Geomagnetic field - Theoretical Geomagnetic field observed value is measured using instruments like proton precession magnetometer or flux gate magnetometer etc , whereas Theoretical values are computed by IGRF formula which takes coordinates , elevation of the point as input . ($URL$ ) My doubt is regarding error in anomaly calculation . In the observed part the error is in the range 0.1 - 1 nT depending on the instrument . IGRF error for total field is around 152 nT . 

What could be the physical explanation for such relationship . I understand that sea water intrusions can take place in coastal regions , but how does temperature come into the picture ? 

One possible example could be the study of ice cores in Antarctica where scientists are trying to determine changes in concentrations of gases like carbon dioxide over a period of time . Such variations serve as indicators for other Climate related factors such as Temperature. 

In the formula for slant stacking (tau-p transform) a substitution is made. If we consider the substitution as a vector equation then how can vector d/v have the same length as vector t given that in most surveys the number of data points for offset(d) is less than for time (t) . 

It is fine-grained variety of calcite either Travertine or Tufa. Travertine is a form of limestone deposited by mineral springs, especially hot springs. Travertine often has a fibrous or concentric appearance and exists in white, tan, cream-colored, and even rusty varieties. Tufa is a variety of limestone formed when carbonate minerals precipitate out of ambient temperature water. It goes by several common names: Tecalli, Mexican Onyx, and Mexican Marble. 

Base rock is most likely quartz or feldspar. My best guess is that your specimen is a pseudomorph. I think it might be quartz or feldspar psuedomorph after amphibole or pyroxene. As for location, you would need to find a matching specimen online or in a museum. In mineralogy, a pseudomorph is a mineral or mineral compound that appears in an atypical form (crystal system), resulting from a substitution process in which the appearance and dimensions remain constant, but the original mineral is replaced by another. The name literally means "false form". Here is Talc after quartz from Germany. www.irocks.com 

It is gypsum, variety selenite, specifically named desert rose. Desert rose is selenite where sand or silt become trapped within the gypsum as the crystals grow. 

Clastic sedimentary rocks are classified by size of the sediment particles making up the rock. Particle size descriptions like sand, silt, and clay have specific meaning in geology and engineering. (see chart below). Shales, mudstones and claystones are rock types that are very similar to each other. 

I've always understood that basalt is an extrusive rock (formed by eruption), and dikes are intrusions (no eruption), so I would have thought that a dike could not be composed of basalt rock. It's come to my attention that many people talk about "basalt dikes" in geology, and many websites, including pages of university geology departments, talk about dikes that are basalt. The concept of a "basaltic dike" (note the "ic") makes sense to me: a gabbro or diabase dike whose parental magma had a basaltic composition. So, I know that basaltic dikes exist, but I'd like to have confirmation that there is no such thing as a dike which is basalt rock. 

Neither displacement nor acceleration; most seismometers measure velocity. If you want displacement, you integrate the output over time, and if you want acceleration, you differentiate the output over time. Check the datasheet for the instrument you are interested in. For example, the Guralp 3T datasheet says that it outputs 1500V m/s, so for each meter per second of ground velocity the output increases by 1500V. (It also says it only outputs from +20V to -20V, so this means ground velocities greater than 20/1500 = 0.013 m/s will be "off the chart" i.e. saturate the instrument). Actually, the voltage output from a seismometer is not exactly proportional to displacement, velocity, OR acceleration. The actual output is the input displacement convolved with the impulse response of the seismometer. It's just that the impulse response is designed such that it will have an approximately linear response to ground velocity within the corner frequencies. In the 3T datasheet we were looking at, they say it's within -3 dB of linear as long as it's measuring ground that's not oscillating faster than 50Hz or slower than 0.0083Hz for one version of the instrument. Measuring displacement directly is known as geodesy (as opposed to seismometry) and the tools used for those measurements include GPS, lidar, and radar. To measure acceleration (strong motion), as Jay says, you can use an accelerometer. Or, precariously balanced rocks for the palaeo case! 

I believe it is Silicon carbide / Carborundum crystals, a man made abrasive. A photo from my collection. 

Your rock most likely contains common opal or chalcedony (cryptocrystalline variety of quartz). You will be able to scratch opal with a sturdy steel knife blade but not chalcedony. 

The rock you have is most likely not platinum ore. It appears to be sulfide ore most likely composed of galena, pyrite, and maybe copper sulfides such as bornite. It is more likely that your specimen is silver ore rather than platinum ore. Mexico has a long history of silver mining. There is a platinum deposit in southern mexico and it appears to similar to the Bushveld igneous complex deposit. Ref: Mindat. Layered chromtite ore looks significantly different. Reference. 

Your stone is most likely glass or quartz based on the scratch test. Coloration is odd which is also why I say glass or quartz. Your stone could also be glass. Take it to a jeweler who can measure the refractive Index (RI). RI value will tell you conclusively what it is and you won't damage your stone. Pale colored topaz, beryl and corundum (sapphire) typically are uniform in color so your stone does not match. I've seen similar color pattern in fluorite but it would have been scratched by the pumice.
