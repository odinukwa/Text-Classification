Doing deadlifts with standard breathing causes this sometimes too, hence why most programs restrict them to a set of 5-8 and no more without a rest. In a deadlift you hold your breath for the entirely to brace your core, which can lead to high blood pressure blackouts in some extreme cases. Focus on breathing, out when you move up and in when you move down. Also make the up movement fast and the down slower, you want to explode up and lower gently. 

Bro-science aside, if his method works for him then no-one will be able to tell him differently. I suspect his weight loss is to do with the dehydration from performing cardio. 1-2lbs is basically nothing, your body will vary more in water weight over a day. 

A 2009 study directly comparing the weight loss "fad" diets concluded that provided you reduce calories, the method you do this is not of importance: 

Note: Remember F=ma? (or Ek=0.5mv^2) you need to exert a force to do a activity which requires energy. The amount of force (and hence amount of energy required) is equal to the product of mass and acceleration. More mass that needs to be accelerated (bodyweight) the more force required and so the more energy used. 

Routine: I put this together from a range of different PPL routines. Its a 6 day rotation, either PPL[rest]PPL or PPLPPL[rest]. I lowered individual set volume on the big lifts to continue progression to higher weights. I do accessory AB work at home with planks and ab-wheels on a daily basis. Warm-up: (WW = working weight) I only usually bother with this for the first lift of a muscle group. I don't do a full re-warm up when going from squats to deadlifts. 

As the name implies, supplementation should only be used for additive effects - your primary fitness goals will be mostly achieved via diet and exercise. Still, with that in mind, there are three supplements that are frequently cited as known useful for general health and building muscle: 

No. Front squats aren't really a substitute for back squats either. Buying a small, simple rack on amazon is recommended. 

My recommendation is to do all 3. Keeping your exercise varied and goal-based will enable you to make the most progress by utilising the benefits of all the different ways to burn calories. 3 days a week could be Push/Pull/Legs weightlifting, pair that with some light cardio work and the rest of the time you can do high intensity cardio. 

Telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. This is because the social satisfaction of telling your goal substitutes for the satisfaction of achieving it. Kurt Lewin, father of social psychology, called this phenomenon "substitution" in 1923. Gollwitzer wrote a book about this in 1982 and more recently published some tests about it. 163 people in 4 tests, wrote down their goal. Then, half announced their goal to the room, and half said nothing. Then, they were given 45 minutes of work toward achieving their goal, but told they could stop at any time. Those who had said nothing, worked the full 45 minutes, and at the end still felt they had a long way to go. Those who announced their goal, worked 33 minutes on average, and felt they had gotten a long way to achieving it. "Substitution" is now a well known psychological effect: when you announce your goals to people, you receive psychological satisfaction, and it makes it less likely you achieve them. If you walk around telling friends "I'm going to lose 80 lbs", this makes it less likely you will lose it. If you must tell them something, tell them what you've already done: "I have lost 10 lbs" but don't talk about your goal (although you should certainly have one). There's no two ways about this: when someone says "My goal is to lose 80 lbs and it starts today! Hold me to it" that act alone makes it less likely they will succeed. This TED talk goes into this topic in more detail 

Thoracic Kyphosis and Forward Head ("Computer Guy" Hunchback): Upper cross syndrome is another posture issue caused by sitting while hunching forward (at a computer, over books, etc). Pectorals and the upper back/next tend to be tight as a result and the scapular muscles (shoulder blades) and neck flexors tend to be weak. This post has excellent information on why you're doing different exercises, but many of the links have degraded. This pdf demonstrates how to do the specific exercises mentioned (skip to page 4 for the specifics for this section, although all of the stretches are good). 

With a view to improving cycling/running times when working at that lactate threshold point, could specific training help improve my lactate threshold over time? If so, what type of training would be best suited? 

Firstly, don't compare yourself to others. This is especially important when concerning fitness and nutrition. Your body may be similar but it is not the same as other people. Also be careful about drawing your own assumptions on causality: Your friend's intake of BCAAs is unlikely to be the reason he is lifting more than you. On BCAA's The meta-analysis completed by examine.com summerises: 

The exploitative nature of the show is attacked by Dr Charles Bruant (Edward, 2016), director of the Michigan Metabolomics and Obesity Center, who states: 

What does it mean to bonk or hit the wall during a run or a bike ride? In endurance sports such as cycling and running, "hitting the wall" or the "bonk" is a condition of sudden fatigue and loss of energy which is caused by the depletion of glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. Can this can be a fairly serious thing, so what are the effects of this that makes it so serious? From a logistical perspective, on a bicycle you are at most risk. You could lose balance, swerve into the road, or fail to be able to un-clip from your pedals. In this case the risks vary from a bruised ego to death by oncoming lorry. From a scholar perspective you will have a lower power output: 

How important is nutrient or meal timing? Under most circumstances and in the grand scheme of things, it's not critical. Of far greater importance is hitting your calorie, macro- and micro-nutrient needs over the course of the day. After that, consistency and commitment should be applied to an appropriate workout plan that suits your performance and/or body goals. If you tend to train in a fasted state, getting your post-workout nutrition in as soon as possible is a good idea, but the first two points (daily diet goals, consistent training) still take precedence. (reddit.com) Meal timing does not have significant impact on muscle development. However, your digestive tract may find it easier if you spread your protein evenly over all your meals. EDIT: Note: There is no limit to amount of protein you can eat in one sitting: $URL$ 

A different take, here is a simple progression you can practice. You should start in the pool and at a depth where you can push off the bottom to the top relatively quickly but cannot touch the bottom without going completely underwater by ~30cm. With the below progressions, once you can comfortably do 3 sets of 20 seconds then add the next. 

A month's rest isn't enough to undo all the work you did. Deloading by 10-20% of your previous weight moved is a common recommendation. eg. If you were pushing 60kg 3x10 then move down to 47.5-55kg depending on how you feel. Progress linearly back up to where you were, this shouldn't take more than 4-6 weeks or so. 

In another article Richard Feinman and Eugene Fine dispute the assertation of "a calorie is a calorie" using the first law of thermodynamics by stating that the second law must also be taken into account. Conclusions 

Good, nutritionists are unnecessary. Don't be mistrustful of the internet, there are some folks at reddit/r/fitness, t-nation, youtube and here that really understand what it takes to develop strength at all levels. 

Taking a different view and looking at weight gain, there are fewer studies but the evidence points to the same outcome. 

Next, Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, who was not involved in the show is quoted: 

50lbs a year equates to 1lb a week which is a healthy amount of weight to lose ($URL$ This should help you avoid getting loose skin. Losing too much weight to fast, as you correctly asserted, is usually the reason for loose skin. Take photos every month of yourself and review them, you should be able to see and feel the effects. Alternatively, ask to get a independent review from a doctor. 

Olympic Lifting: Get a coach. Trying to learn anything apart from power cleans by yourself it is so much slower, difficult, dangerous and can lead to poor technique in the long run. Olympic lifting gyms cost the same as regular ones and usually chuck in coaching for a little more. They won't give you programming but can definitely help. Maybe heck out a local crossfit gym as they often do Oly Lifting classes. Alternatively, find someone in your gym who does do the oly lifts and befriend them. You can workout together and help each other, not prefect, but cheaper. Oly lifting is super fun and challenging but I sincerely recommend you don't try to develop it alone. Bodybuilding: Once you have hit your strength goals you should change programmes to a bodybuilding split. The focus on these is less about macro and meso cycles, 1RM's and meticulous planning and more about isolation and volume. This is when you put in your extra exercises on the spreadsheet. Good Bodybuilding Programmes include:
