Yes, if the Universe is matter-dominated and spatially closed, then a cosmological constant: $\Lambda > \frac{4\pi G \rho}{c^2}$ Where $\rho$ is the critical energy density (of matter) of the Universe, will cause it to expand forever. NB Where $\Lambda$ is equal to this value you get the (unstable) Einstein static Universe. 

Yes this is correct for the standard model. I believe the English language explanation would be that the angular size of a galaxy does not depend on its current distance to us, but its distance when the light we currently see from it was emitted (here using "distance" synonymous with "proper distance"). Though I also believe there are other complicating factors such as the spatial geometry of the Universe. Look at the first diagram in Figure 1 in this paper, notice how the size of the past light cone in terms of proper distance firstly increases as we go back in time, before reaching a maximum and decreasing to zero at t = 0. 

This is something that has already been done, so we already have a point of reference. Hayabusa landed on the asteroid 25143 Itokawa in 2005. The mission was considered a success and a sample was returned to Earth. According to sources from the time, the total mission cost was around 170 million dollars and other sources put the development cost of the spacecraft at around 138 million dollars. There is also a planned Hayabusa 2. 

It is common to describe a singularity as a point of infinite density, but really they are more general than that: they are some sort of pathological behaviour in the spacetime metric. Whether singularities are actual physical phenomena or they just demonstrate the point at which a theory (in this case general relativity) can no longer describe nature is a matter of debate. Penrose's singularity theorem demonstrates that under a certain set of very reasonable assumptions that the gravitational collapse of an object like a star inevitably leads to a singularity. Note though the proof is of geodesic incompleteness (i.e. the time-lines of some free-falling object end abruptly). This is not (necessarily) the same as the apparent 'infinite density' curvature singularities that occur in idealized black hole solutions like the Schwarzschild metric. 

The Universe is remarkably homogeneous, i.e. the same everywhere, and isotropic, i.e. the same in every direction (NB homogeneity does not imply isotropy and there are toy cosmological models which are homogeneous but not isotropic) and this is the underlying physical assumption of big bang cosmology. When modelling the Universe the simplification of it being 100% homogeneous and isotropic is most often used as because on the very largest scale (i.e. the scale of the observable Universe) this is very close to being true and any deviations from this are small enough that they do not effect most of the properties being studied. In 100% homogeneous and isotropic Universe, expansion takes place at all places and at all scales. However we know that the Universe is not 100% homogeneous and isotropic, especially on a smaller scale; for example the centre of a star is a very different place from intergalactic space. It is a fair question then to ask in view of this how does expansion manifest itself on smaller scales. We know that in gravitationally bound systems such as our local group (which includes Andromeda) matter has the tendency to be drawn closer by gravity rather than to move away as objects do in an expanding Universe, so it seems our local group is not expanding. Still, it is very tempting to see expansion on this scale as being like a small repulsive force which acts against gravity, but is not strong enough to overcome gravity. So in this sense even the local group would be expanding However the view of expansion acting like a small repulsive force on a small scale is not necessarily the right view. A counterexample would be the Einstein-Strauss Swiss-cheese model where expansion only takes place in deep space and not in the space around stars (modeled as vacuoles). The Einstein-Strauss model though cannot be taken as the last word on the subject as the way it models stars in space is not that realistic. Overall then how expansion manifests itself on a smaller scale is still very much an open question and we just don't know what tiny corrections if any it would make on the dynamics of a very small system such as the solar system. 

Newton's third law is that if a body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts an equal (in magnitude) and opposite (in direction) force on body A. In Newtonian gravity when body A exerts a gravitational force on body B, then body B exerts an equal gravitational force on body A. As both forces are attractive they have opposite directions. General relativity doesn't treat gravity as a force, but Newton's third law can be demonstrated in the Newtonian limit of GR. In big bang cosmology the initial expansion is not due to gravity or any other "force", rather it comes from the initial conditions of the Universe. Matter and radiation have positive energy density and non-negative pressure which both contribute to their gravity which acts to slow down the rate of expansion (the Hubble parameter). However it has been demonstrated that the Universe's rate of expansion is in fact increasing which means that there must exist some form of dark energy which has a negative pressure which is large enough in proportion to its (positive) energy density to accelerate the expansion of the Universe. 

I would expect that the further away a supernova is, the "longer" we observe it will be active because of an increased red shift. Objects in the universe that are further away are generally going away from us faster than objects that are close, hence the increased red shift. This increase in time due to redshift is very similar to the Doppler effect, where a siren is high pitched (and faster) when approaching you (e.g. blue shift with light), and low pitched (and slower) when going away from you (e.g. red shift with light). The faster the siren is moving away, the more the effect (both lower pitch and longer time) will be increased, likewise with light. Here are some sources that may help with what you are looking for (although I haven't been able to find a list exactly like you are looking for): $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Is there any known pair of objects tidally locked with each other? I know the moon is tidally locked with the earth (e.g. one side always facing earth), but I don't know of any pair of objects that are both tidally locked with each other. For example, the planet would be tidally locked with the moon, and the moon would be tidally locked with the planet. 

As far as elements (e.g. on the periodic table) go, I would say the odds are very slim. We already discovered or produced all the elements of the Periodic Table up to atomic number 112 at least. As the number increases, the half lives of the elements generally decreases, and is very short for elements above 102. If this trend holds true as the number increases, practically all the "undiscovered" elements should have turned into the lower known atomic number elements. However, there is hope. There is a theorized "island of stability" where a narrow range of yet to be discovered high atomic number elements may be stable: $URL$ I would say there is a slight chance this element could be discovered in the solar system. 

I would like to know the time the traveler experiences, and the time that everyone else (e.g. those on earth) experience. 

Which planets and moons have we accidentally (or purposely) seeded with life? I would expect this to be any planet or moon we have sent an unsterilized (or not fully sterilized) lander to, or crashed anything into. I am speaking largely of bacteria and other microorganisms that might have hitched a ride on our spacecraft, or any life that was deliberately taken to and left on another world (which I am not aware). I know we went to the moon, we at the very least "seeded the moon" temporarily with life (humans) and probably bacteria on the space suits / lander / equipment we sent. I wondering where we have "seeded" / brought life (even if it doesn't / didn't survive there). 

Main question: Could dark energy (the mysterious accelerating expansion of the universe) be explained by "negative gravity"? "Spin off" questions: 

If Mars were coated in a dark substance that absorbs sunlight (including infrared light), would this heat up Mars? I am envisioning a fine dust that is dispersed into the atmosphere, but possibly settles on Mars's surface all around. If we were able to change the albedo, possibly down to as low as 1%, would that make Mars habitable (temperature wise)? If the albedo were changed all the way to 1%, could this even make Mars too hot? 

I inputed James K's value into my game for the lighting for my earth lit moon level, and here is what it looks like: 

Would an object with mass traveling the speed of light destroy the whole universe because it would have infinite energy / mass? According to $URL$ and other sources, it takes infinite energy to go the speed of light, which should be impossible. However, for the sake of the question, let's assume it were somehow achieved: (e.g. potentially as described here: $URL$ My premise behind it possibly destroying the whole universe is that an object with infinite energy should also have infinite mass (E=mc^2, and infinity / c^2 is still infinity). Infinite mass should have infinite gravity, which may well destroy the entire universe (although, would this destruction travel at the speed of light, so it would "slowly" destroy the universe vs. instantly?). One thought is that it could just form a black hole instead, but as I understand it, a black hole is an infinitely small (singularity) of infinite density, with a "net mass" equal to the net mass that it has ingested.
