There is no rest between one exercise and the next when you superset. You only rest when the superset is fully complete. The length of time that you rest between one superset and the next depends on your training goals. Why Superset? 

There's several approaches that can help you, but one that I've seen help a number of people is called "ladders". The idea is that you are working with a partner, and you only rest for the time it takes your partner to finish their set. If you are by yourself, try to rest about the same time that you were working. With that in mind: 

A common weekly progression would be Texas Method, or something similar. The bottom line is that for squats you'll be doing one volume day, one light recovery day, and one heavy day. The heavy day you are going for a higher weight than you used on the volume day. The bottom line is you are 160 lbs and you are squatting more than your body weight. You can add muscle mass, or just try to make the most of your body weight. It really depends on your goals. If your beginner program isn't working anymore after 3 months, it's time to switch things up. If it's still working, then keep at it. 

At this stage in your training career you are focused on just getting stronger. It's less important whether you choose wide stance or narrow stance, and more important that you consistently improve as the bar gets heavier. 

The articles are very accessible to folks who are not doctors, and at least gives you an idea of what affects T levels, what normal T levels are, and what you can do about it without resorting to crazy measures. A couple of the takeaways from the final installment are: 

How you program your grip strength can really depend on the improvements you need. In general, I would pick three of each of these exercises and do them once a week. Try to beat time, or increase weight with the same time. Again, it really depends on the load you have to carry and how long you have to carry it. I'd taper off the grip training at least 2-3 weeks before your obstacle course. You may do it 6 weeks out and work on carry technique for 3 weeks. You want your forearms pretty rested and ready to go when you finally race. Last thing is that you may reach a point where your grip seems to be getting weaker. If that's the case, skip grip training one week and see how that goes. 

At the end of the day, it really can be a personal preference. I know of many people who take their shoes off for deadlifts. As long as you are on a solid surface, you will have the best leverages this way. If you need a heel, use weightlifting shoes. If not, go barefoot. NOTE: Do not use your weightlifting shoes to do plyometrics and box jumps. The soles are not supposed to be flexible and they are not designed for that type of work. Take the weightlifting shoes off and either do it barefoot or with a different set of shoes. 

Over time you will find ways of employing all of these, and probably more that I didn't mention, to get the results you want. The bottom line is that if you aren't feeling the fatigue like you used to, it's time to impose more demands on your body in some way. 

Yes it's a lot of fat, sugars, and calories. It's also a lot of protein. You need the protein and the calories to build more muscle. For people who have a problem gaining weight, this is a very effective way to do that. According to the account I linked to above, if you do the work needed, you will gain muscle. You'll also have a bit of water retention and a little bit of fat. The water retention will correct itself when you switch to a gallon of water a day. If you continue the work needed to build stronger muscles, you will not magically lose all the weight you gained. If you are an ectomorph, the body type that most commonly has problems gaining weight, the only weight that will remain is the new muscle you built. You might lose some of the fat and water weight, but that's it. Understand how GOMAD is supposed to work. The benefit of the whole milk is not just the sugars and fat. It is the protein that comes with it as well. You have an additional 128g of protein in your diet, that along with the calories provide your body the tools it needs to build muscle. If you give your body the work it needs to tell it to build muscle--that's what you will get. 25lb in a month won't be all muscle, but a good portion of it will be. Substituting with random sugar will not give you the same results. You need the protein as well. 

All ketogenic diets share a common trait: medium to high protein intake. The higher protein intake is necessary to provide the gluconeogenisis process a source of protein other than your muscles and organs. Additionally, if you are lifting weights, the higher protein intake is needed to repair your muscles and supply the necessary amino acids. Building muscle does take a lot of energy, but thankfully the body can use fat as a source of energy. Ketosis based diets will completely deplete the glycogen stores in your muscles and organs by design. This has a negative impact on performance. Unchecked, high intensity exercise like weight lifting can increase the demands of energy enough where ketosis alone isn't enough to supply the energy requirements. This is a bad thing. The cyclic ketogenic diet replenishes the glycogen stores once a week. This gives you most of the week to burn fat, while keeping your energy up to meet the demands of exercise. There have been several studies to show that there is a direct correlation between your body's maximum ability and its weight. As you lose weight, you can expect a loss of your maximum strength. Part of this is due to any cut causing a loss of lean mass as well as fat mass. That doesn't mean you are losing muscle, it very well could be some of the energy support systems that feed the muscle. However, this loss of absolute strength is relatively small compared to your fat loss. Once you reach your goal, you can rebuild that max strength. The high fat content during the week in the cyclic ketogenic diet is sufficient to fuel your training. However, the body does do better with a periodic refeed when you are training hard. 

I'm going to preface my answer by saying I am not as familiar with bodybuilding programming. However, I can answer some of your questions from a more general strength training perspective. Regarding @Jeremy Likeness' quote, the strategy behind both power lifting and weightlifting programming is to be able to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible. In other words, do as much as we can with the muscle we have, since the goal is to demonstrate strength on a stage. As you can imagine, eventually you will have to increase the size and both types of hypertrophy (sarcoplasmic and myofibrilar) to get stronger. However, pushing and pulling heavy requires firing more muscle fibers for short bursts of all out effort. Building muscle size requires exhausting more muscle fibers and forcing them to adapt to get bigger. There are several ways of doing that using different set/rep ranges for proper effect. Shorter rep ranges with more sets emphasize myfibrilar hypertrophy, and longer rep ranges with fewer sets emphasize sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Medium (4-6) reps are a tradeoff and have marginal improvements in both. However, the key to this process is the overall volume. (1 and 2) The program you chose From the looks of the program, the loading phase is all about volume. You are probably going to be around 70-75% of your max. Any more than that and you might be buried in fatigue. You will feel tired, but you should be able to recover properly if you eat well. Introducing or increasing your creatine consumption post workout should help with recovery. This is what loading is all about. Power lifting routines have a similar volume phase that is preparatory for the next phase. The growth phase will be higher intensity, but with the rep ranges there, probably closer to 75-85% of your max. If the weights are chosen correctly, your muscles should feel quite used but not feel so cloudy as you might in the loading phase. This is similar in concept to the "realization" phase in power lifting periodized programming. It's the bodybuilder equivalent to peaking. The cardio is there to help keep fat in check, so don't overemphasize it. (3) Deload Week The first week of the whole cycle is just as important as the remainder. It is an active rest. You'll want to keep the weights around 50-60% of your max. That will help you keep from feeling a bit too crispy. The challenge with high volume work, which is inherent in all strength programming, is managing fatigue. Muscles grow when they are at rest. You still have to put demands on them, but sleep, active rest, etc. are a critical part of getting stronger. You need to give your muscles opportunity to grow. (4) Length of workout Some of the bodybuilding articles, and some power lifting ones as well suggest 1:00 hour as the optimal training time. The reason is managing cortisol levels in your system which is catabolic. Those articles have 90 minutes as the outside length of time. That said, you also have the option of splitting the work up into multiple 1 hour sessions per day to stay inside that training window. I would highly recommend running a program as written for at least one cycle before changing it. This goes for any program you choose. (5) Avoiding Plateau This is the challenge we all face. Avoiding plateau is essentially managing the stress/recovery cycles of supercompensation (i.e. getting stronger/bigger) properly. It is particularly difficult when you are dealing with a program that can bury you with fatigue. Pay attention to how well you can think, and how you feel session to session. Take notes in your training log. If you feel like you are getting weaker, or you are finding it harder to concentrate throughout the day, fatigue is winning. You will want to back off the weight a bit while you are training until you are clear headed. Sometimes the fatigue is masking the strength you have. I recommend coming up with a rating system for how you felt during training. Some days are better than others. A friend of mine has a 4 point rating system: 

Here is one more possibility to throw out there: you may be dealing with sleep apnea. Sleep apnea doesn't have anything to do with your physical activity or your diet. Both my friend and I deal with the ailment, and long before I started getting active he has always been active and healthy. Yet we both deal with it. What is sleep apnea? Sleep apnea occurs when your air ways become obstructed while you are asleep. When I got tested for sleep apnea, I stopped breathing 1/4 of the time--particularly when I should have been in REM sleep. Some of the symptoms I dealt with which caused my doctor to order a sleep study were:
