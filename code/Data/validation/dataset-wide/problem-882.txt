Is there freely available and reliable source, where one can find positions of planets and moons of the Solar system at given time in cartesian coordinates? (I am writing a simple gravity simulator and it would save me a lot of work with conversion.) 

I am interested in current estimate of distribution of planets of various radii in various distances from their parent star. There is many sources, where one can find database of presently known exoplanets, for example exoplanets.org, www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com and others. However, the known exoplanets are, of course, subject to conditional probability of detection by various methods. One cannot take the database as representative distribution, because, for example, hot Jupiters or big planets in general would be greatly overestimated. What are the best resources to obtain current unbiased estimates of exoplanet radii and distances? 

(I'm just answering this part of the question, as James has already answered the main part about GR vs QM.) LIGO have produced an image which shows their best estimate of where these two black holes were: 

This isn't relevant. Regardless of any "clock" running locally on the photon, it is still travelling for a long time (in our frame of reference) to reach its target (our telescope). In fact if this paradox were so, it would be impossible to see anything. If say a distant probe transmits a radio signal to us, travelling for an hour or more at the speed of light, our radio receiver would have to be switched on ready to receive long before the message reached it. Again, not true. So, there simply isn't a paradox.

The middle line is the equator, the second and fourth line are the tropics, the first and fifth are the polar circles. What is the relevance of these bands on Earth? Do these exist on other planets? What purpose do they serve? 

We have not discovered every galaxy in existence, nor have we watched each to see how it is spinning. Most of this answer will heavily be speculation. You have been warned! We have three classifications of galaxy: Spiral, Elliptical and Irregular. Irregular galaxies are thought to be quite young, and predominantly gasses that are yet to combine. Elliptical galaxies are thought to be like a disc, or elongated disk in shape. Spiral galaxies are theorised to be the older of the three, and it is heavily theorised that they are spiral in shape due to a super massive black hole at their center. We can see that it is thought elliptical galaxies will eventually become spiral galaxies 

The telescope has a round aperture (of say 60mm or so) and this behaves as a slit in some ways. It causes diffraction patterns (an Airy disc and concentric circles) when viewing a point source at high magnifications, near the resolution limit of the telescope. Also of slightly out of focus you'll get lots of rings. (By the way this the cause of many "weird" unidentified objects that people photograph or film in the sky; especially a DV camera with odd shaped aperture blades. Surprisingly few people want to hear the explanation though.) So when viewing stars at high-ish power, on very still nights, they actually look like a small white circle surrounded by a single, very thin, circular ring. 

There is an interesting discussion about whether there could be life on Saturn's moon Titan. (For example here.) The life could use reaction of hydrogen and acetylene which are being produced by photolysis in Titan's atmosphere. I would like to know what total energy is available for such life per square meter per day, or at least how much hydrogen is produced in Titan's atmosphere per day. There are some estimates in article McKay and Smith, Icarus, 2005, but I have problem translating the quantities they use for the estimate to total amount of hydrogen produced per unit of time or energy produced per unit of time. 

Your question is difficult to answer exactly, because it touches the question of consciousness, which is problematic in general. But the answer is basically this: Theory of relativity describes the space-time as four-dimensional space that exists as a whole. You are described by a world-line, which contains all states you go through from birth to death. There is many slices, which describe "you" in different times. What you can see is given by what information reached your sensory inputs (your senses) and how they are processed by your brain. The brain creates a model of reality based on your sensory inputs, which is stored in space-like slice of your world-line in the space-time, which we call present. This is what "you" can see. So the reason basically is in how the brain processes the data it is getting. Along you world-line, there is many versions of you at different ages and each version feels its own present and the versions more in the future also have memories of the past (because the brain stores the past sensory inputs). There is no single "present time" in the theory of relativity, only the space-time as a whole. But you should't forget that the theory of relativity is still only a very well working model. Even within the theory of relativity, the question whether space-time exists as a whole, or whether there is "present state", which evolves in time, is rather philosophical than scientific, because there is no observable difference between the two. 

What does it mean for a star when people say it goes 'nova' or super nova, what are the differences? More importantly, can I safely observe these with an amateur telescope? I imagine they would be big enough to spot should one happen! 

Some planets, specifically Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in our solar system, have planetary rings. 

Mercury Laser Altimeter So how does the MLA aide us in determining if Mercury has a liquid core? Well the purpose of the MLA is to: 

Sometimes you can be trying to observe very faint or very small objects in the sky and it wouldn't pay to have these obscured or marred by a scratch or dust on the lenses. I keep to good practices and make sure to replace the cap on the lenses when finished in order to stop dust buildup but inevitably it will get a little dusty and dirty, taking this into consideration: What steps do I need to take to ensure that my lenses are kept in top condition? Can I simply use a damp cloth or sponge and dab the lenses or should I use a softer material, like someone with glasses might have a softer lens cleaner? Do I require a special cleaning fluid or can a good quality clean be done without any additional cleaning agents? 

If this worked, then you can get a T-threaded extension tube to go on the back of your current adapter, to hold the camera in position. See for example this link: $URL$ 

What else could it be? Very simply, it could all be a coincidence... What they have done is noted that objects in the outer solar system have their orbits grouped in interesting ways. Someone suggested this might indicate there was a heavy planet (or core of a giant protoplanet) that influenced their orbits in this way; the recent announcement is the result of examining this idea in detail. It is likely to be caused by gravitational influence of such a body. Of course the TV and newspapers have picked this up and said a planet HAS been discovered. But there might be nothing at all; the loose clustering could all be a coincidence - though that seems, statistically, unlikely at the moment. Here is the paper for anyone who wants to check. (Beware, lots of mathematical terminology.) 

Note: This picture and the mount in the link are NOT the same mount. Try to set up out of direct view of a source of light, i.e street-light or porch light. This is because you will suffer from a lack of contrast, making it harder to view the objects. So dark spots are good! Light Filters A good, fairly cheap method*, for negating light pollution that I have found is to use a light filter, these usually just screw on over the telescope and filter out light of that wavelength. However, a very important point to note is that light filters will also filter out light from stars, galaxies and star clusters, making them appear duller. Light filters actually decrease 'sky glow' which is, in part, due to the upper atmosphere. What these filters are best for is looking at nebulas Nebulas emit light of a different wavelength that are not dulled by the filter and they pass straight through. 

Anyway, in summary my guess is changing the eyepieces straight away won't make a dramatic difference. Eyepiece makers will say otherwise of course :) 

It's not possible I'm afraid. Optical wavelengths (light) are typically of a wavelength under a micron, and an optical surface needs to be accurate to this level or better to be useful. Radio wavelengths are typically 10-20cm or longer, and an adequate reflector can be made with surfaces accurate to a few centimetres (at a guess as I don't know the exact tolerance). Also - I once experimented using a frequently mentioned substitute, a convex shaving mirror(!) as a reflecting telescope. Even that was so poor it was unusable at the lowest possible magnification. (But it is possible to make your own reflector out of reasonably stable glass - it just won't be as big as a satellite dish! Search around for "Amateur telescope making".)
