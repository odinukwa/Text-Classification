Summary: It sounds like you really only fall into category A. As I said above, I can't see any reason to not just mention your conditions up front. Both of you are fairly fixed in the matter, and you are unlikely to gain anything in negotiation by not revealing your intentions. 

OTE means On-target Earnings. (See also what Wikipedia has to say.) It is usually used when an employee has a "variable" component (commission, bonus, etc.) to their compensation. Their compensation is made up of both base salary plus the variable bonus, commission, etc. "On-target earnings" is used to describe the sum of both of these amounts. OTE = Base + Commission + Bonus + whatever else can be annualized, like stock. OTE represents a big "IF" — IF you earn all of your "expected" commission, bonuses, etc. 

In either case, you've got to get your work done, and/or at least avoid being found slacking/relaxing a majority of the time to be held in high regard as a motivated, productive worker. 

I actually like thinking about it the way the question was phrased on our surveys: "Describe how [person] can be more effective in his or her role." This helps me frame all feedback in a positive light, not negative. 

Yesterday, a person in another company sent me a file that I had requested. The file was shared via an online document system, and even though the online document is brand new, the downloaded file is the same as the version I was sent last time. The files are identical in every way (name and md5). Even though I know this is wrong, it's an innocent mistake anyone can make, it hasn't inconvenienced me at all, and I don't want to make it seem otherwise. I'm having trouble coming up with the right words — how can I correct and ask for the right file in the most polite but simple/direct way possible? 

I have been listening to a lot of leadership podcasts. One was an interview with former Indianapolis Colts' Super Bowl-winning coach Tony Dungy, who wrote a book titled The Mentor Leader: Secrets to Building People and Teams That Win Consistently. Tony Dungy is a champion of the idea that the teams that win are the teams with the most unity of purpose, not the teams with the absolute best players. I am not a direct leader of my team, and our team does not have a manager who works on the same day-to-day items. Sometimes I feel like we lack unity of purpose, and I would like to help its growth. How can I improve my team's unity, and provide general leadership without entering into any of the potential pitfalls? Is setting an example the only way? 

It's going to be situational. I would discuss it with the new company up front — before you receive a job offer. Some companies will be fine with it, some will need you to start sooner. They might, however, wonder why. If you are choosing to leave, why do you need to do this? Why would you prioritize your old company over the new one? That might give them pause. Lastly, here is some advice that is purely my opinion: it might benefit you to be more decisive in your moves. If you think it's time to move on, do it now. If you find a place to move on to, don't hesitate. You can begin to prepare documentation for training as a courtesy to your current employer, but you're not really under an obligation to do so. 

In my experience, it still absolutely depends on where you are interviewing. Here's some generally-applicable advice: 

I would approach this by deciding (on a case-by-case basis, if necessary) your own answer to this question: Why would I consider going through this effort if I know the job is for another location? There are a few answers I can think of. A. I am hoping that if they really like me, they'll let me work remotely. This one is fairly easy. You should just mention this up front and avoid wasting their time. The reason I suggest this is that I've never found an example where a company was willing to accept remote workers but didn't know it yet. They either know that they can hire remote workers, and are prepared to do so, or they want everyone on site. So, let them know up front and let them tell you which they are. B. I like the company so much, that if I get the job, I'll take it and move, in spite of my restrictions. In this case, you should take the interview, and you really don't need to mention anything up front. Instead, you need to start figuring out how you'll handle your obligations so you can move. In my experience, if you aren't local, companies are prepared for it to take a little while for you to wrap things up and move. Some are more flexible than others. Some will make it easy for you to do so with relocation assistance, some will leave you on your own. But either way, they know that this will come up in the conversation. You can have it early, but if you know you want the job, you don't really need to. C. I am hoping that if they really like me, and I tell them I can't move, they'll blow me out the water with an "offer I can't refuse". See B. However, I believe this to be fairly unlikely unless you are in a very specialized industry. Hiring is an optimization task for most companies. They go outside their local area when they know it can pay off. And it pays off when the expected value exceed the additional cost: interview travel expenses, relocation, additional screening time. The expected value is based on the average candidate. In my experience, companies are unlikely to perceive your individual value as much higher than the average for your role, so it's unlikely they will go to extraordinary lengths to hire you. D. There aren't any conditions under which I can imagine taking the offer. It's flattering to be asked to interview, but if your case falls in this category, be honest and skip it. 

Again, we don't have a lot of information (other than money) about why you are considering reneging your acceptance of the offer from Company B. But, it will be uncomfortable, but it's business, and as long as you maintain integrity, professionalism, and give Company B a fair chance, you should be able to get through this. 

This is one of those dangerous personality types; dangerous, because they aren't likely to change. When hiring (or being hired yourself), stay away. The reality is people aren't likely to change anything. People learn, but they don't change their personality. If a person is not open to learning by nature, there isn't much you can do. But is the choice really, "deal with them the way they are" or "dictate new terms/fire them if they don't comply"? Maybe, but the second isn't really an option at all — successful teams are built on trust and rules/ultimatums don't get you very far with trust. I would go for a third option, if you have the power to make this happen: Make it clear that what makes an individual successful is making the team successful. Prima donnas have no place in such an environment. A person gets to be a prima donna by being rewarded (in some way) for being the smartest person.* Make sure that doesn't happen and that everyone else is aligned in making the team succeed, and the prima donna will either need to follow or they will stand out for not helping accomplish (or even impeding) the team's goals. Likewise, the team's goal is to make the company successful. If not, the team itself is a prima donna. If lack of alignment around company mission/vision (or lack of company vision altogether) is a problem for you, I recommend the Entreleadership podcast series, particularly episode 2 (interview with Tony Hsieh of Zappos), 10 (team unity with Tony Dungy) and the Jim Collins episodes. I'd copy down some of the advice but the topic is too big and I could not do the interviews themselves justice. 

How would you respond to the request normally? There isn't much different at a new job except the following: 

After all, if you can't connect the dots between the problem and a better solution, then they aren't going to learn anything from the process. So, you have to help them solve the problem themselves. 

If there is something they can do to persuade you, I would know what that is before you talk to them and be prepared to tell them what it is. How to actually bring it up Once you know exactly why you don't want to simply go forward with Company B, you need to take the information to them honestly, and see how they react. This will involve typical negotiation tactics, which I am no expert on, but your situation is essentially that you have two offers and are deciding between them. There is a wealth of information online about how to play one party against another, but in this case, remember that Company B is more analogous to your own employer than your new offer from Company C. This might be in the form of an email or phone call like this: 

... and many other things. But, I would say that from experience, it's usually not just money. Following that, most companies are willing to be more flexible than you'd think about money. You've been given new material information, that you didn't have access to when you accepted (Company C purchasing Company A). This is out of your control, and it is reasonable for to reconsider based on factors out of your control. However, considering that Company B has put effort in to you and may have momentum, your reasoning should be fairly strong. It's a different situation than if you were at a simple fork in the road. You will be changing direction. So, for Company B to understand your reconsideration, they need to know why it matters — so that they can compete with it if they'd like to try. 

You should take initiative; not to bug them again, but to go find the answer. I don't know the nature of your work, but in my own experience, if a worker is given access to the data and tools to do their job, then rarely do they absolutely have to wait on a coworker for an answer. If you're waiting for: 

This is often because they don't want candidates to have the opportunity to work around them — to decline and then make direct contact with the company, cutting them out of the transaction and costing them their commission. Recruiting companies deal with a lot of money for each position (20 to 35 percent of the starting salary, says this article), and typically won't get any commission if the hire was not found by the recruiter. At the same time, the company can't be expected to give up good potential hires that contact them directly. This is why initial job postings sent to potential candidates by recruiters often don't include the company name. It puts the recruiter at risk of losing that contact if the candidate declines but then (good intentions or bad) goes directly to the company. As for advertised job postings (gathering instead of hunting), it's the same thinking: they want to make sure their advertising money brings them the commission. I was told this by a recruiter when I asked who the company was for before I agreed to have them send my resume to the company. He said they normally won't tell candidates until the candidate agrees to work with them. 

I would dig at the core of the issue, which is that your team hasn't bought into the idea. See where the disconnect is, but avoid creating a rules culture. Sending them home for being late (a disciplinary tactic you'd find in an elementary school) will lead your team to believe you see them as children who can't be trusted. 

Summary: Show initiative by doing as much as you can before returning to ask the question again. Take ownership, no matter how low the priority of your projects is in the company. This will show that you are the right person to take on projects of increasing importance. 

If you decide to decline, you should simply say "I've already taken a new position, but thank you for your response." And, if you'd like them to retain your resume for the future, say so. 

In the moment Reacting appropriately in the moment is something that comes natural to some people and takes endless training for others (like myself). If you are simply so surprised that you are speechless, I would either do as you did, thank them and leave, or simply ask a question: "Can you please explain? I'm not sure I understand." If they are asserting that others share their opinion as well, I wouldn't hesitate to ask them to back that up. When it's about something negative, they really shouldn't be speaking for others, anyway. If you believe they've expressed all they can and you'd like to not dig into it any further, simply apologize in a polite, but ambiguous way: "I'm sorry that what I've done has caused you to feel that way, I'll consider that in the future." Unfortunately, in a professional setting, there's probably not much benefit from letting someone know that something was hurtful. Taking the high road will be seen as gracious by better people, and a hurtful person is probably not going to recognize the problem. A careless person could end up simply blaming you for taking offense. Afterward The only approach is to remove your bias and be rational. 

The sooner you ask the better. It sounds like you are already at the offer stage, so it might be a little late. It is going to depend entirely on the company itself. Here are a couple of ways the company might see this issue:
