I imagine you want something stronger then my first answer, but weaker than my second. I am not sure what it it, though. 

Here is a proof of the Weyl dimension formula, up to a constant factor, that does not go through the Weyl character formula. I leave up to you how geometric you consider this. Set $\mu=\lambda+\rho$. It is clear that the answer will be a polynomial in $\mu$, of degree $\leq \dim_{\mathbb{C}} X$. Lemma: This polynomial is $W$-antisymmetric. Proof: To see this, it will be easier to work with the description of $X$ as $K/T$, where $K$ is the compact real form of $G$, and $T$ the maximal torus. There are two $W$ actions on $K/T$: the one from the left, which exists because $K/T$ is a coset space, and the one from the right, which exists because $W$ normalizes $T$. We will be concerned with the second action. Note that this action is not holomorphic, and is very hard to see from the $G/B$ description of $X$. Under the identification of $H^2(X)$ with $\mathfrak{t}^*$, this $W$ action induces the standard reflection representation of $W$. On top cohomology, $W$ acts by the sign character. Using the latter fact, for any differential form $\eta$, we have $\int_X w^*(\eta) = (-1)^{\ell(w)} \int_X \eta$. Let's apply this to the integrand we care about. We write $\Phi^{+}$ for the set of positive roots. $$ w^* \left( e^{\mu} \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi^{+}} \frac{\alpha}{e^{\alpha/2} - e^{- \alpha/2}} \right) = e^{w(\mu)} \prod_{\alpha \in w \Phi^{+}} \frac{\alpha}{e^{\alpha/2} - e^{- \alpha/2}}$$ We can partition $w \Phi^{+}$ into $A := \Phi^{+} \cap w \Phi^{+}$ and $B = \Phi^{-} \cap w \Phi^{+}$. Then $A \sqcup (-B) = \Phi^{+}$. Abbreviate $T(\alpha) := \alpha/(e^{\alpha/2} - e^{- \alpha/2})$ and note that $T(\alpha) = T(- \alpha)$. So $$\prod_{\alpha \in w \Phi^{+}} T(\alpha) = \prod_{\alpha \in A } T(\alpha) \prod_{\alpha \in B} T(\alpha) = \prod_{\alpha \in A } T(\alpha) \prod_{\alpha \in B} T(-\alpha)= \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi^{+}} T(\alpha)$$ Putting it all together, we see that $$\int_X e^{w \mu} \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi^{+}} T(\alpha) = \int_X w^* \left( e^{\mu} \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi^{+}} T(\alpha) \right) = (-1)^{\ell(w)} \int_X e^{\mu} \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi^{+}} T(\alpha)$$ This proves the lemma. $\square$ Now, let $\beta$ be any root in $\Phi^{+}$. Suppose that $\langle \mu, \beta \rangle =0$. Let $t$ be the reflection which negates $\beta$. Then $t(\mu)=\mu$, and $(-1)^{\ell(t)} = -1$, so our polynomial must vanish at $\mu$. Thus, our polynomial is divisible by $\langle \cdot , \beta \rangle$. Since our polynomial has degree $\leq \dim_{\mathbb{C}} X = |\Phi^{+}|$, it must be $c \prod_{\beta \in \Phi^{+}} \langle \cdot , \beta \rangle$ for some constant $c$. I found a couple of ways to work out the constant, but none of them were as clean as I'd like, so I'll leave it there. 

Based on comments below, and on reading the motivating question, I didn't understand right. The question is, given an action $G(k) \times X(k) \to X(k)$, so that $g \times X(k) \to X(k)$ is algebraic for every $k \in G(k)$, can we conclude that it comes from an algebraic map $G \times X \to X$. But I don't think there is any good way to force this. For example, suppose that $k$ has a nontrivial automorphism $\sigma$ and $G$ is defined over the fixed field of $\sigma$. (Think of complex conjugation.) Then $\sigma$ induces an automorphism of $G(k)$ as an abstract group. Take any algebraic action $G \times X \to X$ and compose with the automorphism of $k$ to get a very nonalgebraic action of $G(k)$ on $X(k)$. 

Whew! That's only half the work. We now want to show that $\FF_{p^2}[G_1] \cong \FF_{p^2}[G_2]$. The idea is to write each side as a noncommutative $\FF_{p^2}$ algebra generated by $V_i$, where we choose some basis $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ for $V_i$ and send these basis elements to $a^{w_1}-1$ etcetera, where $w_s$ is a lift of $v_s$ to $W_i$. We have an $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ linear map taking $V_1 \otimes \FF_{p^2}$ to $V_2 \otimes \FF_{p^2}$ in a way that respects $\phi$. The low order terms match up. The intuition is that, with enough knowledge of deformation theory, we should be able to lift this low order match to an isomorphism $\FF_{p^2}[G_1] \cong \FF_{p^2}[G_2]$. Anyone want to finish the computation? 

Not for $n=2$. I'm afraid this answer uses a lot more algebraic geometry than the question; I spent some time trying to remove it and failed. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f_1$ and $f_2$ obey a polynomial relation $g(x,y)$. Let $X$ be the curve $g(x,y) = 0$ in $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2}^2$ (the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{F}_2$) and let $\tilde{X}$ be its normalization. So $(f_1, f_2)$ gives a map $\mathbb{A}^2 \to X$ which, since $\mathbb{A}^2$ is normal, must factor through $\tilde{X}$. This describes $\tilde{X}$ as the image of a rational variety, so $\tilde{X}$ is unirational. For curves, unirational is the same as rational. So $X$ is a genus zero curve (with some number of punctures.) But a genus zero curve defined over $\mathbb{F}_2$ can have at most three $\mathbb{F}_2$-points, so the map $\mathbb{A}^2 \to \tilde{X}$ must identify two of the four $\mathbb{F}_2$-points of $\mathbb{A}^2$. This contradicts that these points are supposed to have distinct images under the composition $\mathbb{A}^2 \to \tilde{X} \to X \subset \mathbb{A}^2$. I see no reason the result should hold for $n=3$, and have played a little with a counterexample where $\mathbb{A}^3$ maps to a cubic surface, but I haven't found an example yet. For example, $x^2 y + x y^2 + z^2 + z$ is a smooth cubic that passes through all eight points of $(\mathbb{F}_2)^3$ (and even remains a smooth cubic in $\mathbb{P}^2$ through all fifteen points of $\mathbb{P^2}(\mathbb{F}_2)$); I see no reason that we couldn't map $\mathbb{A}^3$ to it. 

I just wanted to point out this paper to anyone who is interested. The authors report on a massive computational test of Zauner's conjecture. Don't be intimidated by the length; there are 18 pages of math, the rest is all tables of data. I also want to use the word SIC-POVM, as that is what anyone searching this site for references will probably look for. 

Regarding JSE's idea: The appropriate vector space is H^{1,1}, not H^2, since we are dealing with classes of curves. And the bilinear form is not the Euclidean form, but has signature (1,k), by the Hodge index theorem. As I understand it, JSE's idea is that it should be impossible to have infinitely many vectors v_i in (1,k) Minkowski space such that < v_i, v_i> < 0 but < v_i, v_j > > 0 for i \neq j. I disagree. Consider the vectors (1-e_i, sin(pi/2^i), cos(pi/2^i)) where 0 < e_i < (1/2)(1-cos pi/2^{i+1}), in the vector space with norm |(t,x,y)| = t^2 - x^2 - y^2. If I am not mistaken, the inner products between these vectors have the required signs. 

which commutes with certain jdt moves. I need certain specific cases of this, and I have now checked most of the cases I need by hand -- but I'd much rather cite a general theorem about the category of crystals than write out a lot of tableaux bijections. Thanks! 

The operations of reduction (making a ring R0 and S1) and normalization (R1 and S2) stay in the category of affine schemes. Supernormalization can not: The non-R2 singularity k[x,y,z]/xz-y^2 can not be removed by any birational proper map from an affine domain. If you remove "affine", you have probably returned to the problem of resolution of singularities. I'm not sure what happens if you remove birational. 

This definitely looks like an error in Grothendieck's paper! I think I have figured out what he meant. To simplify notation, I will concentrate on the case where Grothendieck builds his example: $H^3$ of a product of $3$ elliptic curves. I prefer to think in homology for this purpose, so I'll be talking about $H_3(E_1 \times E_2 \times E_3)$. Put $X = E_1 \times E_2 \times E_3$ where $E_i = \mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z} \tau_i)$. I'll write $z_i$ for the coordinate on the universal cover of $E_i$, so $dz_i$ is the nonvanishing holomorphic $(1,0)$-form on $E_i$. Let $V$ be the subspace of $H_3(X, \mathbb{Q})$ spanned by the images of all $H_3(Y, \mathbb{Q})$, as $Y$ ranges over $2$-dimensional subvarieties of $X$. Hodge's "general conjecture" is an attempted description of $V$. (The famous Hodge conjecture deals with $H_{2 \dim Y}(Y)$, so we are talking about the span of the fundamental classes; this less famous one allows the subscript on homology to be independent of the dimension of $Y$.) Specifically, Hodge conjectures that $\alpha \in H_3(X, \mathbb{Q})$ lies in $V$ if and only if $\int_{\alpha} \omega=0$ for any $\omega \in H^{(3,0)}(X)$. In fact, $H^{(3,0)}(X)$ is one dimensional, spanned by $d z_1 \wedge d z_2 \wedge dz_3$, so this criterion says that $\int_{\alpha} d z_1 \wedge d z_2 \wedge dz_3=0$. Let's denote the space of $\alpha$ obeying this condition by $V'$. It is easy to see that $V \subseteq V'$, since $ d z_1 \wedge d z_2 \wedge dz_3|_Y=0$ for any algebraic surface $Y$. Grothendieck observes that, for "trivial reasons", $V$ is even dimensional. However, he shows that $V'$ need not be. By Kunneth, we have $$H_3(X, \mathbb{Q}) = \bigoplus_{i_1+i_2+i_3=3} H_{i_1}(E_1, \mathbb{Q}) \otimes H_{i_2}(E_2, \mathbb{Q}) \otimes H_{i_3}(E_3, \mathbb{Q}).$$ Every summand other than $H_1 \otimes H_1 \otimes H_1$ is easily seen to be in $V$. So it is natural to consider the inclusion $V \cap (H_1\otimes H_1 \otimes H_1) \subseteq V' \cap (H_1\otimes H_1 \otimes H_1)$, which will be equality if and only if $V \subseteq V'$ is equality. I believe that Grothendieck, without bothering to say so, has switched to working with these subspaces in his dimension computation. Each of the other summands is two-dimensional, so this doesn't effect the parity of the dimension. So, let's compute the dimension of $V' \cap (H_1\otimes H_1 \otimes H_1)$. Let $\gamma^0_i$ be the $1$-cycle $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ in $E_i$, and let $\gamma^1_i$ be the $1$-cycle $\mathbb{R} \tau_i/\mathbb{Z} \tau_i$. So $\gamma^0_i$, $\gamma^1_i$ is a basis of $H_1(E, \mathbb{Q})$. So a basis for $H_1 \otimes H_1 \otimes H_1$ is the $8$ products $\gamma_1^{j_1} \times \gamma_2^{j_2} \times \gamma_3^{j_3}$, where each $j_i$ is $0$ or $1$. We have $\int_{\gamma_i^j} dz_i = \tau_i^j$, so $$\int_{\gamma_1^{j_1} \times \gamma_2^{j_2} \times \gamma_3^{j_3}} d z_1 \wedge d z_2 \wedge dz_3 = \tau_1^{j_1} \tau_2^{j_2} \tau_3^{j_3}.$$ Putting $$\alpha = \sum_{j_1, j_2, j_3 =0}^1 c(j_1, j_2, j_3)\ [\gamma_1^{j_1} \times \gamma_2^{j_2} \times \gamma_3^{j_3}] \in H_3(X, \mathbb{Q}),$$ we see that $\alpha \in V'$ if and only if $$\sum_{j_1, j_2, j_3 =0}^1 c(j_1, j_2, j_3) \ \tau_1^{j_1} \tau_2^{j_2} \tau_3^{j_3}=0.$$ Thus, $V' \cap (H_1\otimes H_1 \otimes H_1)$ is identified with the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $$\left\{ c \in \mathbb{Q}^{\{0,1\}^3} : \sum_{j_1, j_2, j_3 =0}^1 c(j_1, j_2, j_3) \ \tau_1^{j_1} \tau_2^{j_2} \tau_3^{j_3}=0 \right\}.$$ We see that the dimension of $V' \cap (H_1\otimes H_1 \otimes H_1)$ is $2^3-N$ where $N$ is the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space spanned by the monomials $\tau_1^{j_1} \tau_2^{j_2} \tau_3^{j_3}$. As Grothendieck points out, if $\tau_1=\tau_2=\tau_3$ is a cubic irrational, these monomials span a $3$-dimensional vector space. As you say, for generic $\tau_i$, the monomomials span an $8$ dimensional vector space, so $V' \cap (H_1\otimes H_1 \otimes H_1)=0$. This reflects that the obvious classes, coming from $H_3(E_i \times E_j)$ with $1 \leq i < j \leq 3$, are all in the other summands of $H_3(X)$.
