In Marxs political economy, it is Hegels mystical conception of the Geist which drives Humanity forward via a dialectic|. Though in Marx's conception it is articulated in the class composition of society and the material conditions for production. This is what makes empirical and thus scientific - in his sense. In both of these conceptions we have something over and above nature - that is supernatural. Of course in todays scientific & rationalist discourse, this supernatural element is hidden. EDIT According to Mircea Eliade, a historian of religions: 

I'm reading 'Residence on Earth' by Pablo Neruda. He's a South American poet who spent five years in the far east as a consul, and he wrote this during that period. They speak essentially of his spiritual isolation and alienation. His poetry I imagine was a response to this suffering. His famous youthful song was called 'twenty love poems and a song of despair'. Despair for him then was a minor note, in 'residence' it becomes a kind of existential crisis. Later, he repudiated the work as it for him was a song of death. He'd moved beyond that singular point (so in a sense that point was not singular). Rilke often spoke as silence and aloneness as a condition for his poetry. Whereas for Neruda it was put upon him. It's not enough of course to have these feelings in a deep way, plenty of people have them without becoming artists, one must also have the talent and opportunity to learn to express it. If art is the response to suffering, then it is not surprising that madness, and so called schizophrenia is associated with it. They're the outward form in the personality of an inward singularity. Having said this, Susan Sontag (literary critic) said that there is a certain fetishisation in european culture that asks its artists to suffer as a sign of authenticity. Could this be connected to the suffering christ? Just because europe has desacrilised over the last century or so, does not mean that the inner form of its spirit is dead. John Gray (philosopher) wrote of both communism & capitalism as being forms of christianity on the level of ideology. What is true on a political level could also be true on an inward level. Tagore, an Indian poet, rebuked his fellow poets for embracing European modernity, as a contracting movement rather than an expanding one. One should note that modernity was born after European-wide civil warfare. One could suppose that modernity was a reaction to this, certainly Dada, Surrealism and Primitivism was. Although there are notes of melancholy, there are moments of transcendence, joy, hope and enjoyment of sensuality in Tagores poems. There is also a romantic ideology which elevated sensibility against an increasingly materialistic & industrialised European society. I'm not sure one could characterise Rilke as being incredibly productive, he wrote little and slowly (the duino elegies took ten years), but what he wrote was of lasting significance and read still today. He is essentially a religous poet, a poet of the sacred. 

The Descartian division between mind and body is so pervasive, that one concieves mind as being disembodied; and in one genealogy derives from Avicennas disembodied 'floating man'. But in the above it is animi that translates mind; not knowing Latin, or Augustinian thought I'd speculate that animi means that which animates; which ties it to the body (thinking of Aristotles notion of hylomorphism); is this uninformed guess correct? 

I mean, why treat the two - science and religion as exclusive? Stephen Gould did just that with his notion of non-overlapping magisteria; except, he means that they speak to different areas of human experience - and both valuable and truth-making; it's this sense that Badiou picked up with his notion of the separate truth-procedures of Art, Politics, Science and Love - and then they entangle each other through the discursive spirit of philosophy; Naess, the Norwegian philosopher - and who is analytically disposed - is engaged in something similar. 

This looks rather like how Pythagoreanism is explained in Plato. The One, the Dyad and so on. Does this mean that both Pythagoros and Lao Tze Tung were referencing some primodorial ur-philosophy or that somehow it arose in one of these places and somehow over the distance on continents they managed to influence the other. Or is the most likely story is that they arose independently. Is it possible to make a plausible case for any of these options? The above is glossed in the translation by Richard Ames and David Hall as 

Plato would have said yes - as a form of the Good. Some modern day philosophers of Number suppose it all might be some kind of fiction, but not a hoax. Others suppose both. 

(This is more in the nature of a comment to your question, than an answer; but its a little too long to be one). a. To complicate your reading of standard & non-standard models, one could consider the real line. This seems eminently like a natural object; however it has no natural notion of infinitesimals. This makes it clumsy for the purposes of calculus & analysis. One can introduce a non-standard real line that actually does have them, and this was done originally by utilising non-standard models by Robinson. So here we have a non-standard model to introduce natural features to the real line. Certainly it seems that which model is standard depends on epistemic, pragmatic or aesthetic reasons. b. That there can be standard & non-standard models for some theory is indisputible, but can we be more precise about this? We can, there is the property of categoricity in Model Theory. If it is satisfied it simply means that even when there are more than one model of theory, they are in fact all isomorphic - so in a sense we have only one model. For a first-order theory this is fact not possible. But when we consider this along with the size of the model more can be said. It turns out (when the language of the theory is countable that) all models of each cardinality are isomorphic. Then we can see at least that the standard model occupies a privileged place - it is at the beginning of this transfinite count, this ladder of models. The other interesting thing that can be done is to turn this ladder into a line by topologising it. This makes it look a lot like the real line (except of course its still very different), and then the standard model is at the beginning of a line of models. edit Badiou explores the metaphysics of models in his concept of the model. I think he sees a model as representing a mathematical concept. I'm not able to say much more than that. 

When one actually looks at various cosmologies, as opposed to the modern classical one based on the Newtonian paradigm, the concept of randomness has clear irreducible precursors; for example: 

I expect you've come across the following: Heisenberg argument for his uncertainty principle took into account the act of measurement in 1927 - specifically that the measurement causes a disturbance that it quantifiable in terms of the energy carried by the measurement itself - and then one takes a limit; and also Leo Szilard solution to Maxwells demon also revolved around measurement - the demon needs to measure the speed of molecules - and the act of acquiring this information requires energy. Prior to this of course was Poincares & Einsteins theorising that measurement of time had to be rethought in 1905. These examples, hopefully, give at least some heuristic indication as to why measurement became a closely studied topic. Realism, broadly construed takes the objective existance of the world out there as a given. Newtonian Physics took this picture for granted - the clockwork universe - the objective character of time & space. In this picture one does not need to measure the world out there to know that it is real and has an objective character - and is independent of observers. This is of course a metaphysical supposition. Presumably it was the impact of the discoveries outlined above that made the scientific community rethink this supposition, and to tighten up what it is that was known properly, they turned to epistemology where one considers how one can be sure that the knowledge one has is in fact valid. It was the Vienna & Berlin school of logical positivism that developed out this that became the main steam of Anglo-American philosophy - today referred to as Analytic philosophy - though one sees here that it had continental roots. This philosophy, because it considers only measurement to be valid, and thus true, dismissed that which could not be measured as being ontologically not there at all. They argue, if there are no possible conditions unde which a particular phenomena can be measured, thatwhat right have we have to say that it exists. For example, as one cannot see isolated quarks , they would argue quarks are not otologically real. Whereas, a realist physicist, would say they're obviously real - they're always confined. Hence, despite the emphasis on measurement, logical positivism is seen as an anti-realist school. 

Here, then, is a riddle; can a man who is an athiest then call the 'murderer of God' the 'ugliest man' be wholly an athiest, through and through? Perhaps N is setting us here a riddle himself. 

Democritus wrote about soul or thought atoms. He was a committed materialist. Nevertheless the most well-known presentation of his thought, Lucretious De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) contains paeans to the divine - gods, Nature and the One. 

Contra Einstein is there a theory that has only observable quantities? It may be that Einstein is thinking of only fundamental theories - in which case the answer must be a no. Of course numbers are unobservable, so we can't allow any mathematical theories. Nitzen & Bichler also rule out classical & marxist economics. 

Thus, the world of a photon, in itself, is Void; yet from an other, we see it shooting across the sky. Does this show, contrary to the expectations brought in mind by Parmenides, that Void can have Being? 

According to one reading of the atomic hypothesis it is parts that are fundamental and they tell us what wholes are, and in fact, what wholes are possible. For example: 

There's an interesting angle that Aristotle came up with in the wake of the discovery/invention of atoms by Leucippus & Democritus. According to them atoms are indivisible, permanent elements of reality that retain their identity from the beginning of time to its end, or simply throughout time. All substances arise from their collisions, or their configuration, and dissolve when these disperse. A asked what happens when two atoms collide at their point of collision. Imagine them to be hard, impermeable balls of matter, like for example the balls used in snooker or a game of billiard; now, if their boundaries are apart, that is their boundaries are not touching, then they have not yet collide or, it is after they have collided; if their boundaries are touching at some point such that there is no gap between them then we cannot say that they have preserved their identity. Hence atoms as conjectured by Democritus/Leucippus cannot exist in the way that they imagined them. Epicurus thought well enough of this argument that he conjectured a minima for their approach; one could think of this as some kind of inter-atomic force, a very similar argument can be made to work in classical physics, ie Newtonian; the other possibility of course is that atoms do not retain their identity under all conditions. Then matter is not permanent in this sense. 

It's quite possible for a community of individuals to engage in individually rational behaviour; but which when considered collectively can be irrational; this is one aspect of the Tulip Mania. Also time is a factor; what is rational in the short-term may be irrational in the long-term; and the reverse is possible too. And, a man may be rational but his understanding might not be sufficiently penetrating; such that his actions look irrational. And then there is the obvious factor of information asymmetries. 

First recalling here that physical time is not time as understood by our Sensability & Intuition - the proper sense of time; we also recall that famously Newtonian or Einsteinian Physics do not have an arrow of time. The theory is time reversable. It was an urgent question to establish an arrow. It is thermodynamics that provides such an arrow by using probability via entropy. However there is still no now; and other questions of time remain open. Now, if no matter was available to universe, that is the universe was empty, one is somehow still convinced that time will flow in the same direction. This of course is a Gedanken experiment; it cannot be carried out ever. One resolution is to embed thermodynamics in spacetime altogether by atomising spacetime and applying ideas of entropy to the atoms of space & time. Then one expects an arrow of time to emerge from the simple existence of the space-time manifold. Does this solve the arrow of time question with respect to the Gedanken experiment described above? Notably one attempt at doing this is through causal set theory where spacetime is taken as atomistic and relational.
