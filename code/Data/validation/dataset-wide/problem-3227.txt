Migration This may sound like a strange question, but hear me out. The 19th century was an age of massive population migration, perhaps the most significant in history according to this economic history course. Large numbers of Europeans (British, German, Scots, Irish) emigrated to overseas colonies, often despite very hostile conditions. Many Asians also pulled up roots and moved vast distances, despite the efforts of white governments to keep them out. For example, the British transported 3.5 million Indian indentured laborers to colonies across the world, Chinese immigration played a role in both the California and Australian gold rushes. But despite colonial entanglements all over the world, few Asians, Africans, Middle Easterners, and Latin Americans appear to have reached Western Europe. Immigration Europe then was an obvious source of wealth and innovation, and regularly hungry for cheaper labor. And yet there was very little nonwhite immigration there, prior to 1945. There were slaves before abolition, some Chinese communities that never rose over a few thousand, and small groups of students from various colonies. Ironically, large scale immigration to Western Europe appears to have only begun after WWII and the end of the colonial empires. > Why was there little nonwhite immigration of to Western Europe before the postwar era? And are there any examples of larger-scale immigration being explicitly considered or rejected? I half-expect the answer will boil down to racist paranoia, white workers not wanting competition, and the difficulty of surmounting linguistic and cultural barriers. But, at the same time, that wasn't enough in the U.S. or Australia, and it didn't stop the Irish, Poles, or Jews. Regardless, thanks for your time. 

I've been reading about the history of toys online, as part of a personal project. One thing that surprised me was that every article I've found lists porcelain toys as having been invented by Europeans. Different sites give dates between the 1500s and 1700s, depending on the country, the type of doll, and the method of manufacture. This seems odd to me; for obvious reasons I would have expected china dolls to originate ... in China. It's strange that they would have used it to make figurines, decorative objects, etc., but never produced toys intended for children. So to my question: When and where were the first porcelain or china toys made? Were porcelain toys made in China or Japan prior to the European Renaissance? If so, what were they like? 

DEFINITIONS Pollution, as best I can define it: The idea that immoral, unclean, or ritualistically improper actions can spiritually defile an individual or community and that this necessitates some proscribed cleansing action, presumably to avoid further contamination or spiritual peril. Pretty much every major religion and culture I'm aware of incorporates the notion to some extent For an emphasis on the dangers of religious pollution to be "recognizable" within a culture, it should exhibit an occupation with such themes in its art and religious culture that is noticeably (or at least, very plausibly) greater than other comparable societies that are near it in time or space. 

Update: I'm reading Blood Moon by John Sedgwick, and at one point he says that the outside world saw the Trail of Tears as "pitting the Cherokee against Andrew Jackson and his nefarious Indian Removal Act." I haven't had time to finish the book, but a thorough word search makes me think Sedgwick won't elaborate much further. It's an interesting snippet to me because it implies there was an outside reaction, but seems to claim it was the opposite of what Tocqueville thought. 

Background: This feels like sort of a silly question for me to be asking after reading about the Victorian Age and the British Empire for several months, but here goes. As I've read about the British Empire, a pretty clear tend has emerged; when the British open China to the opium trade, export food out of Ireland during a famine, squelch Indian weavers beneath the weight of British manufacturing, or otherwise exert economic influence and naval muscle abroad, they usually justify their actions, at least in part, as being in the interests of free trade. The same when they repeal the Corn Laws, or otherwise act more beneficently. I understood Free Trade to mean the idea that trade between nations should not taxed or restricted, and that in the long run free markets operate to the benefit of all. But at the same time, I've read that the British empire was in many ways a closed system, one that restricted and taxed the trade of the colonies, both to weigh the benefits of trade in favor of the mother country, and to prevent them from trading with other European powers. I don't expect any society to be free of contradiction, but this seems like a big one, and I'd like to understand it better. Was there a more of contest between Free Trade and mercantilism after 1800 then I'd believed? Or does the British regulation of her various overseas possessions represent more of a pragmatic, ad hoc, system of compromise to financial problems? Or have I just completely missed something really basic? Question: What did the politicians and industrialists of the British Empire, after 1800, mean when they spoke about Free Trade? Especially in reference to the British colonies? 

My understanding is that Johnson embarked upon his dictionary precisely because he found others useless or archaic, and that his work was very well received within his own time. But I wanted to ask if historians have a more concrete idea of how closely his English resembled the language as it was spoken in England during his lifetime, and how unevenly that may apply to speakers of different classes? 

Just to clarify, I'm not asking about the Victorian view of contemporary Americans or America, except as it relates directly to their perspective on what the American Revolution meant, both to Britain and as a piece of world history. The question is basically about Victorian historical memory. 

AN OPTIONAL ADDENDUM Several smaller questions came up as I tried to get a more robust picture of what set apart different groups. These are helpful but optional; answer as many or few as you please, either as part of a full answer or in a comment. 1) Turks and Turcomen. Is there a difference? I got the sense the latter were peripheral tribes? 2) Infantry. Did any group(s) make up the bulk of close-combat infantry levies? 3) Arab Subgroups. What if anything distinguished Egyptian, Syrian, and Bedouin troops? 4) Berbers. I've found absolutely nothing about them in this context. Any scrap helps. 

I'm continuing to read about the history of toys. The U.S. imports between 50%-75% of its toys from Chinese manufacturers (depending on the year), and my understanding is that they many western countries follow similar practices. I've been trying to nail down the earliest origins of this trend, and how it developed historically, but have had little luck separating the history of toy making from the long history of U.S.-Chinese economic relations in general. Any help would be appreciated; thanks for your time. 

BACKGROUND I was reading about the technological diffusion of metallurgy, and started to wonder if there were good historical examples of stone age peoples living near to or having extensive contact with iron age or even early medieval cultures, but without either adapting to metal use or quickly being eradicated or absorbed. (In this case quickly might be 100-200 years.) In other words, I'm looking for examples of technological diffusion failing where intuitively one might think it would succeed. My hope is that I can find enough examples to do some reading and identify common themes. I'd prefer to focus on the Old World, unless there are a dearth of good examples there, as I'm much more interested in why cultures might develop differently in close proximity than to the reactions of Amerindian and Mesoamerican cultures to a foreign transplant. (Still, if someone with good knowledge of New World cultures thinks they have something to say here then I'm always happy to learn.)
