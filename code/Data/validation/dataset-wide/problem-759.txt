Stars can be seen from space. Astronauts, such as James Reilly Describes Seeing Stars in Space. In the video he notes that the stars in space don't twinkle, and that more stars are visible compared with Earth (he actually describes seeing "literally millions", but that is obviously hyperbole). He notes that it can be difficult to pick out the constellations as many of the fainter stars are visible. In reality, several thousand stars are visible, but it depends on the acuity of your vision, and your skill at observing, so no exact number can be given. If you are used to typical light polluted skies, then seeing the stars in a truly dark sky is pretty awe inspiring. 

As an object falls towards a black hole, light emitted by the object will become red-shifted by the gravity. As photons rise out of the gravity well of the black hole they lose energy, they can't slow down but their wavelength is stretched. The object will go dark as it approaches the event horizon due to gravitational redshifting. Photons starting from the event horizon would be redshifted to zero energy, and no photons can travel from inside the event horizon. We also will observe gravitational time dilation, the last second before the object reaches the event horizon will be stretched out indefinitely. The two effects are all part of the same relativistic theory of gravity. You can't unpick the two effects. 

Lets get a sense of scale. The bar is about 30000 light years long, and contains the central bulge of the galaxy, a roughly spherical mass of stars with a diameter of 10000 ly. It's big. The supermassive black hole is pretty big for a black hole, but only about 80 light seconds across. Compared to the size of the bar, it is tiny. The supermassive black hole is found at the centre of the bulge, at the centre of the bar, and entirely within it. Sometimes a star does fall into the black hole. The black hole is currently inactive, that means that there is not much matter falling in every year. Each year, roughly 1/10000 of the mass of the sun falls into the black hole. This is mostly matter from the solar winds of nearby stars. 

These stars are currently moving away from us, in the case of Epsilon Eridani, at 15.5 km/s. In 31500 years they will be further away than they are now, the distance can be calculated by applying Pythagoras' theorem to the distances and velocities you mention. It turns out that Eps Eri will be about 12.2 light years from Earth, and Lutyen 726-8 will be 12.6 light years. They won't be particularly close together in the sky, I estimate about 3 degrees, and they will be even dimmer than they are now, though Eps Eri will still be a naked eye object. 

There is essentially no variation in moon size when viewed from different locations. The radius of the Earth is about 6500km, but the distance to the moon is about 400000 km: This means that the distance to the moon. and hence its apparent size, varies by less than 2% from place to place. That is not enough to be noticed. There is greater variation due to the non-circular orbit of the moon, which produces "super moons" and "micro moons" at regular intervals. Images of very large moons over cities are either photoshopped and fake, or taken with a telephoto to make the moon seem large. Your son is correct. There are no locations on Earth at which the moon is significantly larger in the sky. The Moon is always about Â½ degree. That is significantly smaller than a penny held at arm's length; it's about half the size. 

It is quite correct that a black hole has so much mass that light cannot escape from a region around the black hole. The edge of this region is called the event horizon. If you cross an event horizon you are never coming back. That applies equally to light, and matter. Around the black hole there may be matter in orbit. Since the Black hole has such strong gravity, the speed of the orbiting matter will be very fast. In fact it will be close to the speed of light. This high speed gives it lots of energy. The matter will form a disc, called an accretion disc, around the black hole, and collisions in this disc will cause the matter to heat up, to millions of degrees. At these temperatures, the disc will glow with X-rays. On the part of the disc closest to the black hole, matter will be falling in from the disc, but before it reaches the black hole it can get enough energy to be ejected out, at very high speed, close to the speed of light. It gets ejected at right angles to the disc, at the poles of the black hole. These are the "jets". Intense radiation is produced along these jets. Blazars are distant supermassive black holes with jets that are pointed right at us. So the black hole itself is "black", but the matter orbiting around it may be very bright. 

Congratulations, you have seen a fireball. An especially bright meteor. It was bright and fast. This is a rock, a very small asteroid, hitting our atmosphere and "buring up". It is also possibly a satellite or space junk re-entering. Re-entering satellites look move slower than asteroids. You can see fireball videos on youtube, as well as re-entries, to compare. This event was also witnessed from Puducherry, the details seem to match up quite well. The time is slightly out, but the location is spot on. You can add your report at $URL$ No, its not Florence, which will not be entering our atmosphere, and so will not appear to be burning, it will be a single point of light. It will be moving much slower, and won't be visible with the naked eye. 

Many astronomical objects are too dim to be easily seen. There is no place in the universe where M42 (between Orion's legs) would look to the naked eye like it does in photos: it is too dim, and our eyes are not good at detecting colour of dim objects. Unlike a regular camera, which has pixel detectors for red green and blue light, most coloured astronomical images are made by using a sequence of filters in front of the camera lens. The filters only let a particular colour through. The result is several greyscale images, when several images have been made of the same object, they are mixed together, by assigning a colour to each. So "red" may represent infrared, for example, a colour that cannot be seen by humans. The assignment of image colours to filters is called a pallet, and can make a big difference to the appearance of an image. The Hubble images of "the pillars of creation" popularised a particular pallet, and Hubble site has some details on how they create the colours in images. The hubble pallet uses "blue" for a mid range filter, yellow green (this colour is produced by oxygen ions), "green" for and orangy red filte: it picks up the light from hydrogen ions, and "red" for a intense red, fading towards the infra-red (sulphur). By using "false colour" details of the distribution of ions can be picked out better, and it makes a more attractive image. 

Meteor showers are associated with dust trails left by comets, There are larger clumps, but most cometary dust is pretty small. Most large impactors are small asteroids: This was certainly the case in Chelyabinsk, and is the likely the case with Tunguska. Asteroids are not associated with cometary orbits and the impacts are sporadic, not concentrated in showers. Each year there are 10s of significant bolides They don't correlate with meteor showers. (Tunguska did occur during a regular shower, the Beta Taurids, and some have hypothesised that it may have be an fragment of Comet Encke, but analysis of the impact site suggests that this was a coincidence.) 

You can't make an interferometer by combining photographs. You need to combine the light sources so that the light waves can "interfere", which means you need to have not only the intensity of the light, but also the phase of the wavelength. A CCD only detects the intensity. You also need to position your telescopes to sub-wavelength accuracy. For Radio telescopes, with long wavelengths, it is possible to detect and then combine the radio signals from several telescopes electronically. That's not possible with light. Visible wavelength interferometers capture the light and combine it as light. It requires very high precision. Finally, we still have the atmosphere to contend with. Amateur observers know that, beyond a certain size (about 10in), larger telescopes don't have greater resolution, because of the blurring due to the atmosphere. Bigger mirrors mean more light, mean dimmer objects can be seen, but no more detail is visible. There are ways of getting round this, (Lucky imaging) but these are not suited to interferometery. So since placing amateur telescopes at nanometer accurate positions, and linking their output with single strand optical fibre is beyond the budget of amateurs, and since the results would be limited by the distortion of the atmosphere, this is not normally done. 

The full equation for the time for an object to drop is $$t = \frac{ \arccos \Big( \sqrt{ \frac{x}{r} }\Big) + \sqrt{ \frac{x}{r} \ ( 1 - \frac{x}{r} ) } }{ \sqrt{ 2 \mu } } \, r^{3/2},$$ where $x$ is the radius of the sun, $r$ is distance of the object, and $\mu=GM=1.327\times10^{20}$. (in SI units, so you will need to convert your distance to metres, and get a time in seconds.) As $x<<r$ you can assume $\frac{x}{r}=0$ so the formula simplifies to $$\frac{\pi r^{3/2}}{2\sqrt{2\mu}}$$ For an object released at 0.1,0.5 or 1 light year that is 3000000 years, thirty million years or a hundred million years. For the speed on impact, you can assume that the body will reach very close to the escape velocity of the sun, which is about 620 km/s. It matters little whether the body is released from 0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 lightyears, because the body will pick up speed only when it approaches the sun. The last part of you question is unclear. If the body is at rest relative to the sun, and the various gravitational affects of other stars are ignored, then it will fall towards the sun. If on the otherhand the body is at rest relative to the centre of the galaxy, then it is moving extremely fast relative to the sun, much faster than the sun's escape velocity. It won't fall anywhere near to the sun, instead the sun will deflect it slightly as it falls towards the centre of the galaxy. 

The ecliptic was understood to be the path of the sun relative to the sky. Ptolemy believed the sky rotated daily around the Earth. All the planets, including the Moon and the Sun, shared in this motion. However, the planets had secondary motions, relative to the sky. And in particular relative to the stars that they thought were fixed to the sky. This motion was discovered by careful observations of the sky, and was very well known, long before Ptolemy. The motion of the stars was very simple: therefore when Ptolemy was describing his system, he only concerned himself with the motion of the planets (including the moon and sun) relative to the stars. It was clear that the planets all approximately followed a great circle relative to the stars. This great circle is the ecliptic. The Sun's motion was the simplest. It was exactly on the great circle, and it's position relative to the stars moved almost evenly. The other planets (including the moon) had orbits that were less even, but by introducing a system of Eccentrics, Deferents, Epicycles and Equants, Ptolemy was able to account for nearly all their motions. The precession of the equinoxes was noticed because the Greeks used a calendar based on the heliacal rising (the date that stars are just visible before sunrise) of certain stars. And it was noticed that the heliacal rising was changing relative to the seasons and the equinox. We understand the reason for this to be the precession of the equinoxes. 

The Earth is a sphere (or is nearly a sphere). So to make a map of the whole Earth you would need to project it onto a flat surface. When you do this you create distortions. For example, on many maps, the straight line between New York and Japan looks like a long curve. It is not actually a curve, but when you stretch the surface of Earth to make it flat, some straight lines become curved. The sky is also a sphere. If you ignore distance and just think of the direction of each point in the sky it would be a huge sphere that surrounds you. When we take a picture of the sky we must project that sphere onto a flat surface. That causes distortions, and it means that what is a straight line on the sphere of the sky is distorted by the projection into a curve. If you choose a projection in which the milky way goes straight across the middle, you can see that the milky way goes straight across the sky. The appearance of an "arch" is a distortion caused by stretching the image to fit on your flat screen. It is not real. 

The equations of motion are just second order ordinary differential equations. They can be solved numerically by any of the usual methods, However, for two bodies an exact solution can be found, that solution was known to Kepler. To model the trajectory you need to know the orbital period and the eccentricty (e) of the orbit. If you know the period of orbit of a body, then the "Mean anomaly (M)" is the angle time/period *2*pi radians (it increases uniformly from zero to 2pi in one orbital period. The find the Eccentric anomaly ("E", the angle made by the body, the center of the elliptical orbit and the point of periapsis when the body is closest to the sun) you solve $M=E-e\sin(E)$ (it can be solved by newton's method quickly, though convergence is fastest for roughly circular orbits. You then know the body is on a ellipse, with the sun at one focus and you have calculated the ray on which the body is found at a given time. This gives you the position of the body. There is a rough implementation of this in a python gist
