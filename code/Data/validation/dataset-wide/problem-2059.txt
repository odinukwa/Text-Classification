The fact that your boss said this in front of you could be seen as an implicit indication for you to pass this info along to your coworker, particularly since you have more experience and could potentially provide some mentoring in this area. What to do next will depend in large part upon your working relationship with this female coworker. If you and she have a good working relationship, that's a good sign. If you are a Tech Lead or even informally mentor this coworker, that's an even better sign. However, only you know best how she would respond to any information you brought to her. I have worked with people over the years whom I would NEVER bring up this information with them because they would not react or respond well to it. If you feel that you are in a position to bring this up to her, and that she would react positively to it, then yes I think you should bring it to her attention. Have an informal one on one conversation with her. Tell her what the boss said and try to give some context. You don't want her to panic, and this kind of news can make people panicky. I would suggest if you're willing to bring this up to her, then you should be prepared to help if at all possible. A little guidance and a few answered questions might be all that's needed. 

Hiring is definitely seasonal, and there are probably more seasons than any of us in here can count. Tax preparations companies in the U.S. start training seasonal tax preparers in the fall so they are ready to start working from January through April. Retailers in the U.S. start hiring seasonal workers in the fall for the Winter Holiday Season. Years ago, I worked at UPS as a seasonal worker loading trucks starting in early September. At that time, they brought on seasonal staff in late August or early September, and if you worked out through the Winter Holiday Season, then you might get offered full time employment. I got sick and was out in December, so I didn't get a full time gig. There is a phenomenon known as "fishing for candidates", which some companies regularly engage in, particularly in the software arena. I've been in IT for 26 years, and I've had recruiters tell me about the phenomenon. I ask the recruiter about Position X with Company Y in City Z that I saw advertised, and the recruiter's response is, "Yeah, so?" Something of an odd response from someone who would make money if they presented my resume and I were hired. The recruiter would then give me a brief overview, from there perspective, about the position, what the company wants, and what the company is willing to pay. It doesn't sound very enticing, so I ask, "Is the company just fishing?", and the recruiter says, "Yes." They've learned the companies who engage in it, and perhaps have even figured out how the text of a job posting might somehow indicate they are just fishing and have no intention of actually hiring. Some might reasonably ask the question, "Why would a company elicit for resumes if they have no intention of hiring? That wastes time and money." It consumes time and money, but it is not necessarily a waste. Fishing can be an easy way of finding out quickly what the available talent pool looks like for a given position. If the company got 2 resumes in 2 weeks, then this may be an area where the pickings are slim and the hiring process will take a longer period of time. If the company got 30 resumes in the first hour, then the talent pool is much deeper and they can afford to be very choosy. Posting a position and counting the resumes gives the company some useful data upon which to decide what is their next step. 

Back in 2000, the consulting firm I worked for called me up because they found my resume on Monster. They wanted to know if there was a problem, was I looking to go elsewhere, or what. I gave them three reasons. First, I'd had my resume on Monster ever since I first learned about Monster, and in fact I think that's how they found me. Second, I sometimes get Emails or calls from friends who are looking for work. Third, this is a consulting gig, on a contract with a life expectancy, and I've been on contracts before that ended suddenly so I need to remain as mobile as possible, even though I'm not looking to leave the contract I'm working. Even if you're happy in your current gig, with no intention of ever leaving, let me direct you to speak with any number of people I've worked with in the past who are no longer working for the company they'd been with for years or even decades. The future is a theoretical concept with no basis in reality vis-Ã -vis employment. As for how to respond to your employer if they find your profile on LinkedIn, I would use the Friends and Family argument. You know people who may be looking for work and if a recruiter contacts you then you'd like to be able to connect that person with the recruiter. Another angle you could use is that LinkedIn, in your experience, is a good determinate of the market. If recruiters are contacting you from time to time, then you know that you have a marketable skill and are of value to your current employer. If that were to end, then you might have to reassess your current skillset to determine if there is something you need to do in order to remain of value to your current employer. Finally, and I would NOT share this with management, LinkedIn may provide you with an opportunity that you might otherwise never have found. No matter how contented you are in your current position, there are opportunities out there that you would not pass up, if they were to come your way. As such, don't shortchange yourself. 

Some people are awful in face to face communication. To the extent possible, you might try sending this person an Email with your questions. Maybe you will get a different response. Also, your questions might really be challenging this person, and to cover up their lack of deep knowledge, they might be taking it out on you. If you send an Email, they can read it, review it, research, collect their thoughts, and then answer you. Make no mistake, bullying is a serious and growing issue in the workplace. I see it all the time, and as a union shop steward I deal with it regularly. There is a huge array of information out there about how bullying adversely affects the financial bottom line of organizations. As such, management should take an eager and active role is attempting to curb bullying whenever they find it because bullying costs money--mostly not from lawsuits but from lost productivity. Does the organization any sort of probation period for employment? 3 months is often the norm, and if so you are past that. However, I know of organization that have 6 to 12 month probation periods. If you are past probation, start out having a private, one on one conversation with your immediate Supervisor. Tell your Sup that this senior male architect makes you feel uncomfortable and bullied whenever you speak with him. In my view, I would leave out any reference to gender bias or discrimination. I find that organizations will often interpret charges of bad behavior to the worst possible scenario, gender bias, and then attempt to disprove gender bias without addressing the more general charge of bullying. Keep the conversation around your discomfort and a feeling of being bullied. Also, humanize the person by using their first name. I understand why you didn't use their name publicly here on SE, but in talking with your Sup use his name and don't refer to him in any way that could be seen negative, like "That man" or "That person" or "HIM!" All that said, after 26 years working in IT, I've never seen any organization--either public or private sector--take a serious interest in addressing and curbing bullying. The cynical advice, that I've followed myself on more than one occasion, is to heed the wisdom of Ed Yourdon in his book "Death March". It is easier to find another organization that matches your values than it is to change the values of an organization. 

This is a legitimate concern for many. One does her job, one thinks I'm doing a good job, and only when the layoffs hit or during an annual review is one hit with one's deficiencies. While I'm not an advocate for meetings, I do think regular one on one meetings between a Supervisor or Manager and her or his Direct Reports is extremely valuable. Here are some questions you might try, but use what works for you and fits you. Over time, it is desired that more natural, instinctive, and casual conversation will ensue during these meetings, but in the beginning you will likely have to take the lead to make it happen. How are things? What are the challenges that we aren't addressing? What concerns do you have about the project, the business unit, etc.? I see a rare quality in you that you recognize the value in people, both individually and collectively. You are, in my view, correct to be guarded about singling people out for their strengths and accomplishments. In saying, "Bob, you did a great job on Project X", there is this unspoken criticism of everyone else involved in Project X. Most would agree that Bob could not have accomplished Project X all by himself, and there are probably more than a few people who contributed to Project X. There is a great read, in my view, on this subject called "Peopleware" by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister. Pick up a copy, read it, and see if it speaks to you. If it does, buy a copy for everyone on the team and ask them to read it. Go through a couple chapters a week, and meet as a team to discuss it. Watch "Greatness" on Youtube. It's a presentation by retired US Navy Captain David Marquet. If it speaks to you, show it to your team as a group and elicit their thoughts. $URL$ 

If you've earned the Leave, then take it. The further in advance you ask for the Leave, then the more likely that it will be Approved. We all have our own quirks and eccentricities and those sometimes manifest themselves in when we take Leave. Not everyone takes 2 to 4 weeks off during the summer to visit Yellowstone. I take some Leave throughout the year on days my kids are off school. Makes it easier on the wife, and I get to spend more time with them. Some places will take into consideration seniority for Leave, so the boss will likely look at when others are planning to take off next year. As such, it's possible your Leave won't get approved until more senior staff have asked for and been given Leave next year. As for the boss being a cool, weirdo, workaholic, that may or may not be cause for concern. Maybe he hates his wife. Maybe he is a little insecure about himself. Maybe he really loves what he does. Maybe he is just a weirdo. If you're skilled, capable, and competent, then that should be the reason for getting raises and promotions in the future. If over time you discover that isn't the case, and this guy only promotes other workaholics, then at some point down the road you be forced to consider if you want to work for a company that is ruled by workaholics. However, that is down the road and extremely hypothetical today. Don't sweat problems that have not appeared, and enjoy the music. As you know, music makes it go round in circles, and fly high like a bird up in the sky. 

Your employer is insisting that you do something in order to continue your employment with your employer. While they cannot force you to relocate--unless it were say the US Military--they could certainly terminate your employment--unless there were some sort of contractually agreement between you and your employer on this point. As I see it, you have three choices. 1) Relocate as your employer insists. 2) Quit or be terminated and go elsewhere. 3) Try to negotiate the issue with your employer. It sounds like you want to pursue Option #3. If so, then you may need to change the language you use with your Manager. Whether you are willing to quit or not, do NOT focus on that aspect of the conversation. Turn it into a positive argument about your continued employment with the company and at your current location is the ideal for both of you. If you simply insist upon this being right for you, then you are going to lose and you might as well just pull the cord and exercise Option #1 or Option #2. Try something like this in a one on one, face to face, communication with your Manager. "Hi Boss. Thank you for meeting with me. When I relocated, we talked about this and all agreed this was a Win-Win situation for both the company and me. I understand there is a desire for me to relocate back, and I believe it would continue to be a Win-Win for me to remain where I am. What are your thoughts on this?" Be brief and ask an open ended question, then shut up and stop talking. Let your Boss respond. See where they are at on the subject. Maybe they are willing to discuss it further. Maybe they are willing to let you remain where you are, but someone higher up like the New Senior Director is overriding them. Maybe they are convinced that it's best for you to relocate and their heels are dug in. Whatever the case, don't invest a lot of time and energy in your argument if their mind is made up and the issue is non-negotiable. If they are willing, then be prepared when they talk about it, ask questions, and the like. Maybe they would be willing to negotiate a change to your current situation such as having you be physically in the office half of the time, or one week out of the month, or something else. Don't immediately say no to these possibilities, even if you know in your mind the answer is Absolutely Not. Be willing to hear them out and consider other possibilities because that is what you are asking them to do. Be prepared to argue the value you provide from your current location. Try not to make it personal, even though being close to your family is a personal issue. The company, and the New Senior Director, are likely thinking in terms of pure dollars and cents and your personal situation doesn't make one danged bit of difference to them. However, you do want to bring up Work/Life Balance and how your physical location fulfills that. Practice this conversation at home, in front of the mirror, and with a family member acting in the role of your Boss. Whatever you do, don't make any threatening statements like, "If you insist upon this then I'm going to quit" or "You can't make me move back there." They know they cannot make you move back there, and they already know about Options #1 and #2. You want to keep the focus on Option #3.
