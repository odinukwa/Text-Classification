So, it was legally within the power of the Reichstag to block or remove Hitler even after he was elected. Even after he was president, the Reichstag could have not only blocked his emergency decree, they could have voted him down in no confidence and forced him to withstand a plebiscite, and even if he passed this plebiscite, the Reichstag had power over both the purse of the Reich and had the power to remove ANY minister, so legally speaking they could have rendered even President Hitler powerless, if they so chose. The dynamics of the situation were that Hitler actually had a minority of support, but those who did support him were near-fanatical; that is why he was able to take over. At the time many people, typically upper middle class wage earners were dismayed at the rise of the National Socialists, but they were drowned out by the parades, celebrations and esprit of that party. If you remember what it was like when Obama was elected, how there were large cheering crowds, and Oprah crying, and the news casters enthusiastically declaring a new age. Imagine that and multiply it times 100 and you will have some idea what it was like. In every town Nazis were parading up and down through the streets carry banners. They were firing old corrupt bureaucrats and replacing them with new "modern", "efficient" officials. They were re-arranging water works, charity systems, road building, you name it. The old conservatives that opposed this were in the majority, but they basically just stood by with their mouths open while this hurricane passed by them. There is a book called "The Nazi Seizure of Power" by William Allen which describes what happened through the lens of single town. If you want to understand the political forces involved I suggest starting with that book. 

Thus, not only did everyone in England know of the glory of Rome past, many lived it as fallen and conquered Romans hoping for a restoration. 

Since Callicates was a 5th century BC philosopher, it would seemly likely she said it in the 5th century BC. Note that linguistic evidence cannot be used to date the author, because it is very likely the text was changed or emended at some point. For example, Stobaeus, the sole source for the quote, who was writing in the 5th century AD, many hundreds of years later, may have changed or altered the text in some way. Also, Stobaeus may have relied on a different author's rendition of Phyntis, which is even more likely. In this scenario, Phyntis' work may have been related by some compiler in the 4th, 3rd or 2nd century BC who edited the text using language familiar to them, and Stobaeus simply repeated that author's version. In either case, the exact language ultimately received could be different than what Phyntis originally wrote. Just as one example of this are the "writings" of Aesop, who is one of the earliest Greek authors. The language we have of his is largely believed to be that of later compilers, not his own. 

They lived in shanty towns and makeshift shelters until the government built apartment blocks. In many cases families lived in shacks or even tents for years. When I was a young boy I was friends with two girls whose mother had come from Germany and had been a little girl during the war. Once they showed me a handful of photographs her mother had saved. One of the photographs was of her home, which was a corrugated tin shack in a railroad yard. The dimensions of the shack were about 8 feet by 8 feet by 6 feet tall. This was where she and her mother lived. Her father was killed in the war and her grandfather had been a surgeon, but also died by that time. Many Germans and other refugees lived in concentration camps run by the allies which were called "displaced persons" camps or "DP camps". In some cases the DP camps were Nazi concentration camps that had simply been taken over and reused by the allies. For example, the notorious concentration camp at Dachau was used as a DP camp after the war. By 1946 there were over 2,000 camps in Germany housing refugees, all run by allied soldiers. There were so many homeless people that those who could be housed in concentration camps were the lucky ones. Many, like my friend's mother, lived in shacks that they hid away wherever they could. Millions of the less fortunate who were captured in allied dragnets were at first kept in open fields called "Rheinwiesenlager". These were large grass fields of thousands of acres surrounded with berms and guarded by soldiers with machine guns. After a few months the allies opened these camps and released millions of completely destitute people to shift however they could, or be funnelled to DP camps. People took shelter in basements, old military bunkers, pillboxes, and even just caves made out of rubble. The only regular food were bread rations given out by the US Army. In 1946, the ration was 1275 calories, and to get this you had to sign up, be interrogated and risk being arrested for "war crimes" or be put into a "de-nazification" prison. There are very few photographs from occupied Germany because it was illegal for Germans to own cameras and similar regulations were enforced to prevent allied soldiers owning cameras or from taking pictures. It was also illegal to take aerial photographs of occupied Germany. This situation only persisted until 1948. In 1949, with the founding of the Republic of Germany the new government began large, subsidized housing programs, which included both apartment blocks and single-family homes. Even with these programs Germany has a relatively low rate of home ownership today and most Germans rent their dwellings. Two photographs below show the progression. The first, circa 1949, shows Quonset huts in Hamburg. Notice the large rectangular bomb shelter in the center that survived the bombing. The second photo from the 1950s shows the same view after government-subsized housing had been constructed.

The first unequivocal and provable use of gunpowder in any significant way during a battle which involved an actual gun (cannon throwing shot) was at the Battle of Crecy (1346). Even in this case, the account (by Froissart) can be questioned as possibly exaggerated or anachronistic. The first absolutely provable use of gunpowder by reference to actual contemporary, verifiable documents occurred at various sieges in France which occurred in the 1370s. In those cases there are actual letters and inventories showing the purchase of guns and gunpowder and are factually incontrovertible. All the mentions identified by later historians speculating on supposed uses of gunpowder prior to 1346 are even more dubious (in most cases much more dubious) than Froissart's description. Just to address one such dubious claim is the reference to the Battle of Mohi. In this case a Chinese encyclopedia written hundreds of years after the actual battle claimed that "fire pots" were used in the battle. Some so-called scholars have inferred from this account that the Mongols used gunpowder, a completely ridiculous idea. The European accounts of the battle make no mention of fire pots, probably because the use of incendiaries was commonplace in Europe at the time and had been commonplace for over 1000 years. An incendiary is not a gunpowder, it is any flammable substance, which includes naptha, pitch, oil and many other such substances. 

(1) One account of the Danaan invasion of Ireland has it that upon landing, they burned their ships, causing a great mist to rise up and terrifying the inhabitants who thought the Danaans arrived in a cloud. (2) In Book V of the Aeneid, the Trojan women attempt to burn the ships after they arrive on Sicily, but a rainstorm thwarts their plans. (3) In 351 BC, Sidon rebelled against Ochus, the King of Persia. They burned all the ships in the harbor to prevent anyone from fleeing. When it became clear that the city had been betrayed and the Persians were entering, they set fire to their own homes and the entire city was obliterated. (4) In 296, the Praetorian Prefect, Asclepiodotus, commanded an army belonging to the emperor Constantius Chlorus, and led it against the usurper Allectus. Having arrived in Britain to confront Allectus, Asclepiodotus burned his own ships to prevent his men from retreating. (5) In 363, Julian the Apostate, Emperor of Rome invaded Persia. After his army crossed the Tigris he had all the pontoons and barges burned so there would be no thought of going back. (6) In 711, Tariq ibn Ziyad, for whom Gibraltar is named, landed there, burned his ships and embarked on the conquest of Spain. (7) Some accounts claim that William the Duke of Normandy burnt his ships on arriving in England in 1066. (8) In 1169, a group of about 250 English freebooters under the bastards Robert Fitz-Stephen, Meiler Fitz-Henry, and Meiler Fitz-David, along with a vassal of king Henry, named Hervey Montmorency, raided Wexford, and having been repulsed they were so ashamed, they burnt their ships and determined to succeed or die trying. (9) Hernando Cortez supposedly burned his ships in 1519 to prevent anyone returning to Cuba and reporting his mutiny to the Spanish governor there. (10) According to a book published in 1689, which purported to be the journal of a pirate named Raveneau de Lussan, he at one point led his men across the isthmus of the Americas through Honduras after first burning their ship to prevent anyone from defecting. (11) In 1779, during the celebrated battle between John Paul Jones and the English ship of the line, Serapis, rather than flee or surrender Jones desparately kamikazeed his sinking ship into the Serapis and captured it va banque. (12) In 1789, sailors serving on the HMS Bounty under the notorious Captain Bly mutinied and sailed to Pitcairn Island where they burned the Bounty. 

Of course, in many cases the states did not pay, or paid only a portion of what the Congress docked them. 

Not just microbiology, but all sciences virtually went on hold during the war. Research plummeted. Many schools had trouble attracting students, who were being drafted into the war and had to charge less tuition as demand dropped for advanced education. Also, unlike WW2, there were no deferments for students or scientists. If you were a 23-year-old biologist you were just as likely to get conscripted as a 23-year-old welder. Many promising scientists were killed in the trenches. One of the most brilliant physicists of the 20th century, Henry Moseley, was killed when he was 27 on the beaches of Gallipoli. Many other promising young scientists met the same fate. 

Before the 1840s national currency was more or less non-existent, like the US dollar, was rare and only used in big northern cities, like Philadelphia and New York. Early dollars are so rare they are collectors items. In virtually all the states a local currency was used, which in North Carolina was called the "pound". Technically the pound was denominated in US dollars, but in reality it was denominated in Spanish silver dollars which were also used as currency and were directly convertible into the local currency. So, for example, you could pay in Spanish dollars at a fixed rate of exchange which was considered equivalent to the pound. The other option was to get a bank note. This would be issued by a private bank and would be denominated in "pounds". In the South, the bank itself would be backed by Spanish dollars. So, your money would say something like "Bank of Charlotte, 10 pounds, signed [Treasurer of Bank of Charlotte]". If you took your "bank note" to the bank and demanded specie, they would give you Spanish dollars. In the North, things were different. In Boston, where I live, we used what we called "country money" or "Boston money". These were bank notes, just like those in North Carolina, but the difference is that we did not have much access to Spanish dollars. For this reason, it was difficult to get specie and everything was done in bank notes, unlike in the South where specie was much more common. There were actually quasi-laws that basically made it more or less impossible for the average person in Boston to get specie from a bank. If you were rich and connected, you could demand specie in Boston under the right conditions. If you did so, what you would get would be some kind of foreign money, probably either English, French, Portuguese or Spanish. I quote from a law of 1806 which gives you an idea of what you might get:
