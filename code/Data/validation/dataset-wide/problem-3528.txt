So, here goes: Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) If you bought an orange for a dollar and sold it for two, you have one dollar of Gross Profit Operating Profit = Gross Profit - Labor - SG&A If you're business paid someone \$100 to sell 200 oranges (like above), you would have \$200 in Gross profit, and \$100 in Operating Profit (assuming no other overhead like licenses, etc) for that business line. Operating Profit can be for a firm, business line, or whole company. Depreciation and Amortization can be included here for assets and debts in service to the entity or business line in question. Typically Operating Profit tells whether a business line, unit, or company is profitable (independent of interest and taxes as explained below in the EBIT section). Operating Profit and EBIT are not completely interchangeable in common parlance, though, as EBIT is typically used only for a company and Operating Income is often used both for Companies, and individual product lines within the company. EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization If the same business paid \$10 to incorporate, that would come out here, so your company's EBITDA would be \$90. EBIT includes Depreciation and Amortization If you'd also used your \$100 office (independent of the orange selling operation or it would have also been in the orange selling Operating Profit line) for 1/100 of it's operating life, you would have \$1 in depreciation. Bringing your EBIT down to \$89. EBIT is almost always a company level statistic, and rolls up all Depreciation, Amortization, and costs other than Interest and Taxes. The reason people analyze EBIT, is that it gives you a feeling for if the company could be profitable if moved to a different tax jurisdiction, or if its WACC (weighted average cost of capital) were changed through recapitalization. Net Profit = EBIT - Interest - Taxes So if you'd paid \$1 in interest on a \$100 loan to buy the oranges in the first place, you're pre-tax income would be \$88, which you would report to the appropriate tax agency, assuming a 35% corporate tax rate, you'd pay \$30.80 in taxes, leaving you a Net profit of \$57.20. This is usually the "bottom line" of an income statement. 

Let us put these terms like GDP, GNP and other stated economic indicators aside for a moment. Saying that nations have "developed" is rather a very easy way to address the question of why growth rates have declined. So our problem is low growth right, how do we achieve low growth. I mean we are living in a Utopia, everything is fine, prices are stable and low, production is high as usual, demand is high as usual, the credit rating of our country is good, our people have no debt, there are no people left in the economy unemployed, there are more and more people choosing entrepreneurship, meaning almost all problems of society are being addressed by free market, and finally; the government is not interfering in many of the day to day activities other than providing legal backbone to the market. Now lets smash the utopia one by one. Suddenly the government changes its mood, says it needs to flex its muscle. It starts looking at the free market to start flexing itself, now remember, everything is hunky dory; but the government rather than providing LEGAL backbone, is now expanding further into moral space. Rather than letting the free market decide the demand and supply of goods and services, the government now tries to manipulate it to "Achieve Optimal Results". So how to control to market, well you just can't tie the hands and legs of the buyers and sellers, so you use your Legal power to make laws which control, that's right, price and quantity. With price ceilings/floor, and restrictions/regulations on production in place, government ensures itself to be a significant (actually more than significant) member of the Erstwhile free market. Now count all the goods which government can price control on; commodities,raw materials, and, did you forget MONEY! Out of $S_n$ $total $ $supply$ of the economy, $n^{th}$ good is money. The utopia is now feeling uneasy, the market cannot decide the rates for various stuff it trades, so we start experiencing volatility. Now a sane successful businessman has build his enterprise from his life blood and time, so that man will be there for his enterprise for a long long time. But this is not true for government, the man who is in government will stay there for say 4 years; and even before assuming office, will start thinking how to win the next elections. So soon people will start speculating on the market. Corporations, fed up of being taxed will invest most of their profits back into the market, which will drive their prices high. Soon, due to regulations and bone-breaking taxes, production will become low, or it will become so efficient, that for a considerable interim period, there will be very few jobs. Since now people start becoming unemployed, they need someone to take care of their basic needs like shelter, medicine, food, etc. Now government ain't saying nothing to help these poor folks, but then elections depends on votes of these folks. So soon government starts helping out these people, which not to say is a bad thing, but it just makes the problems worse. On an individual level, the incentive to work depreciates. This continues on in a vicious cycle and soon becomes a part of politics. With not enough corporations to tax, government starts selling its contracts at a negative interest rate; flooding the market with more money, increasing the prices and thus making the poor more poor, and the rich, well marginally rich. Now combine all the points above and see what the result will be. Yes India and China are having a higher rate, but what economic sense says that countries with already higher GDP's cannot grow? It sounds more like an excuse from charlatans than a rational, logical, sensible fact backed analysis. And yeah, did I told you about $DEBT$ 

I have previously posted a very similar question on Stackoverflow, but based on responses there I have decided that the real nub of my question is economic. I will give a longish introduction, mainly to distinguish what I know (introduction) from what I am asking (last 3 paragraphs, skip to it if you like). Suppose I have a pdf or a CDF that represents the size distribution of income. Income is a flow of money (dollars or some unit of currency), per some unit of time, to particular individuals. I therefor think the proper unit of measurement is dollars per person-year. In order for the probability to come out in dimensionless units, f(x) must be measured in person-years per dollar. Integrating this over x also yields a dimensionless share for the CDF because the units of an integral are the product of the units of the integrand , here measured in person-years/dollar, and of the differential , here measured in dollars/person-year. Integrating therefore puts the units on the mean income in $/person-year; this seems reasonable. From this I have drawn conclusions on the units and interpretation of the quantile density function , quantile function , and the integral of (i.e. the the inverse function analogue of the partial moment function of order 1) which if correct would be very helpful to me, but in which I have limited confidence. Iâ€™d be grateful if someone could confirm or deny these conclusions, perhaps in the context of some discussion/explanation of interpretation of dimensional analysis in the the context of distribution functions. I believe the units of the y axis and of q(y) are necessarily the same as those in the previous pdf/CDF analysis, i.e. the y values are still measured in person-years per dollar and x = q(y) is still measured in $/person-year. This implies that integrals of q(y) over some interval in general, and Q(y) (which is equal to the integral of q(y) from 0 to y) in particular, are both measured in unitless shares. However (uncertain interpretation #1) is in unitless shares of total income, while Q(y) is in unitless shares of the population for a year. Finally, (uncertain interpretation #2) this would have the integral of in units of person-years per dollar. But I am having trouble interpreting this. The corresponding x quantity is the mean (or for a bounded x, the partial mean) of income per person-year. So this would be the mean number of person-years--for what? for a single dollar? for the mean income? Consider the truncated version of this function, where the integral of from zero to is divided by . The corresponding truncated function of x yields the mean for those with incomes of x* or less, and $/person-year seems like reasonable units for a mean income. But I want the the y version to come out in number of people, or number of person-years, corresponding to the share of person-years over the same interval, and the "per dollar" in the denominator, which I need to make the CDF(x) and Q(y) unitless, does not have an interpretation which is obvious to me. 

Analyzed over $(0,5)$ these would coincide, and an analyst might not have any expectation that increasing by a small factor would dramatically increase cost, and while the (simple) derivative at any point on the line is the same for either line (inside the step interval), this is very misleading. Further, I chose $5$ at random, a more generalized idea might be something along the lines of: $$C(n) = n+\frac{S(n-\mod(n,w))}{w}$$ where $S$ is the step cost, and $w$ is the width. Summary: Given these concepts, why are step cost functions generally treated as less preferential in discussing models? Or is that just my experience, and not indicative of the way the field treats cost functions as a whole? I ask this, because whenever I see a discussion of a cost function, it seems to be continuous, and whenever I see mention of a step function it seems to be an afterthought. 

In a closed two-factor economy, suppose there is a biased technological improvement that increases the productivity of both factors, but one more than the other. Can this reduce the aggregate returns (and not just the share of returns) to one factor? If so, how is that consistent with the usual rules of factor pricing? Doesn't (or can't) the marginal productivity of both factors rise with their respective total productivity? Finally, if biased technology improvement can result either in increased payments to both factors (in real terms) or in increase to one and decrease to the other, how might one characterize quantitatively the conditions for (partially) immiserizing technological growth? 

So the Fed along with the US government declares that it will start controlling the prices within the US territory. There will be some simple consequences to this decision, $1)$ Investors who invest in enterprises and corporations, big and small will run away, literally run away. This will drive the investments at an all time low. Ask yourself, why would anyone invest their hard earned cash in the US if they would not be allowed to enjoy the profits. After all, profits revenues and other benefits are a result of price flexibility. $2)$ No price means no profit, means no investment means soon many private entities will either stop functioning or just find some other country to move to. If there are no other entities to tax on, whom will the government tax on. $3)$ If prices remain fixed, then who will the government give its money? Who will even want the money. What good use is the money if an individual cannot buy or sell, in short have any purchasing power. Here you go, $URL$ 

NIIP includes (and in fact is predominantly) personal assets. The government of Japan could not sell the assets of its citizens to satisfy its sovereign debt.

For an easily digestible schedule of rates, see the Wikipedia article, or for the official tax code, You can check out the Internal Revenue Code at the Cornell Law Library. There are of course many exemptions, and US tax policy is fairly nuanced, both in incentivizing certain behaviors (i.e. making primary home mortgage interest deductible), and disincenting other behaviors through consumption taxes (i.e. sin taxes). For a historical discussion, see the tax policy center and their discussion. In effect, the average effective federal income tax rate (which is different than nominal tax rate discussed above) was 18.1% for all tax payers. Which I think is the short answer you're looking for. 

Over the last fifty years U.S. average household size has declined dramatically. When making within-year comparisons of household income, it is regarded as good practice to adjust for adult-equivalent household size, often by dividing by the square root of the number of household members or the poverty level for households of that size, or by summing some weighted value of number of adults and number f children. Assuming (as I do) that this practice is appropriate, should equivalence scales also be used in making intertemporal comparisons? I am very much of two minds about this. Changes in birth control technology, divorce law, and public assistance all suggest that constraints on smaller family sizes have been relaxed. If people took advantage of that relaxation, the usual economic approach would suggest that the change is welfare-improving. On the other hand, if families are shrinking mainly because men are louts and have increased ability to shirk their family support responsibilities, then that conclusion seems insecure at best. To put the question in more concrete terms, I am doing some work on inequality trends using the CPS, and applying an inverse square root household size adjustment to HH income. I am thinking of normalizing that adjustment with a constant so as to leave median income the same, so that it is applied within but not between years. I can not decide if that is a good idea or not. Is there a literature on this? I find it remarkable (shocking, actually) that this forum does not have tags for family economics (that's a field, for gosh sake), marriage, fertility, or any related item I could find. Or for intertemporal comparisons of utility or welfare. 

The Labor Theory of Value has been replaced by the theory of Marginal Utility, which was already accepted by Marx time. In fact he acknowledged: 

This set of lecture notes cites a bunch of great studies. Effectively, this lecture said that fiscal consolidation (austerity) might have been expansionary (good). The Federal Reserve, however says: 

You're just intermediating. The US companies would still have to pay their workers in USD, therefor, instead of the Japanese companies buying dollars in your scenario, the exporters are using the importers' Yen to buy dollars. It's the same net effect.
