The answer is no in general. For an easy $2$-dimensional case, take for example $X=\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$, in which case $d=2$. Then, only the multiples of $d$ are possible for $d'$. Indeed, take a morphism $X\to \mathbb{P}^2$, and denote by $D$ the divisor of its linear system, which satisfies $D^2=d'$. The Picard group of $X$ is generated by $f_1,f_2$, the two fibres of the two projections, and $D=af_1+bf_2$, so $d'=D^2=2ab$. 

One other example: in characteristic $p>0$ there exist non trivial embeddings of the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1$ into the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$ (i.e. embeddings that are not equal to the composition of $x\mapsto (x,0)$ with an automorphism of $\mathbb{A}^2$). For example, $x\mapsto (x^{p^2},x^{p^2+p}+x)$ is an embbeding because $k[x^{p^2},x^{p^2+p}+x]=k[x]$ (take $f=x^{p^2}$ and $g=x^{p^2+p}+x$, then $g^p-f^{p+1}=x^p$). It is not trivial because the degree of one component does not divide the other one. In characteristic zero, there is no non-trivial embedding of $\mathbb{A}^1$ into $\mathbb{A}^2$. This is the famous Abhyankar-Moh theorem (Abhyankar, S.; Moh, T. T., Embeddings of the line in the plane. J. Reine Angew. Math. 276 (1975), 148â€“166.) 

The weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1,1,n)$ can be viewed as $\mathbb{P}(1,1,n)=\mathbb{C}^3\setminus \{0\}/(x,y,z)\sim (\lambda x,\lambda y,\lambda^n z)$. For $n=1$ we obtain the standard projective plane. For $n>1$, the point $(0,0,1)$ is the unique singular point, and the blow-up of this point is a Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_n$, with exceptional divisor $E\simeq \mathbb{P}^1$ of self-intersection $-n$. Hence, what you are looking for is just the quotient singularity of $\mathbb{P}(1,1,n)$. If you want a local embedding into some affine space, take the local embedding $(x,y,z)\mapsto (x^n/z,x^{n-1}y/z,\dots,xy^{n-1}/z,y^n/z)$. The equations are probably easy to obtain from this explicit description. For $n=2$ you obtain what you already described. 

Let $\pi \colon X\to \mathbb{P}^4$ be the blow-up of a smooth surface $S\subset \mathbb{P}^4$. Is there a formula to compute $(K_X)^4$ ? (which should be dependent on invariants of $S$). In dimension $3$, the formula is $(K_X)^3=62-8d+2g$, where $d$ is the degree of the curve and $g$ is its genus. 

Suppose we are given two smooth projective varieties $X$ and $Y$ over $k$. Let $D^b(X)$ and $D^b(Y)$ denote the derived category of coherent sheaves. Furthermore let $k\subset L$ be a finite Galois extension of $k$. Suppose there is an equivalence $F:D^b(X\otimes_k L)\rightarrow D^b(Y\otimes_k L)$. If one has an object $\mathcal{T}$ in $D^b(X\otimes_k L)$ that descents i.e. there is an object $\mathcal{K}$ in $D^b(X)$ such that $\pi^*\mathcal{K}\simeq \mathcal{T}$, where $\pi:X\otimes_k L\rightarrow X$ is the projection, does the object $F(\mathcal{T})$ also descent? Maybe this depends on the functor $F$ ? 

For the Grassmannians Kapranov proved that there is a tilting bundle consisting of $\sum^{\lambda}(\mathcal{T})$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the tautological bundle and $\sum^{\lambda}$ the Schur functor. I want to learn somthing more on Schur functors, especially for sheaves. Does anybody know a good reference ? 

I have two questions concerning the existence and uniqueness of enhancements in the following cases: i.) Let $A$ be a finite dimensional $k$ algebra of finite global dimension. Does the triangulated category $D^b(\mathrm{mod}A)$ of finitely generated $A$ modules admit (unique) enhancement? ii.) let $X$ be a smooth projective scheme over $k$. Then $D^b(X)$ has a unique enhancement. What is about admissible subcategories $R\subset D^b(X)$...Do they have (unique) enhancements? 

Let $X$ be a smooth complete intersection in $\mathbb{P}^n$. I am searching for literature on the K-theory for $X$? I guess the K-theory is known... 

The Grothendick group of a smooth curve over $k=\bar{k}$ is $K_0(C)=\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathrm{Pic}(C)$ and is finitely generated only for $\mathbb{P}^1$. When is $K_0(C)$ finitely generated when $k\neq\bar{k}$? 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two smooth projective surfaces and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ a birational morphism. Let $E$ be the exceptional curve on $X$ that is contracted. Now EGA III Theorem 4.1.5 states that the functor $\mathcal{F}\mapsto f^*\mathcal{F}$ is an equivalence between categories of locally free $\mathcal{O}_Y$-modules of rank $r$ and locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules $\mathcal{E}$ of the same rank such that the restriction of $\mathcal{E}$ to the formal completition $\mathcal{X}=X_{/E}$ is trival. Is it possible to generalize this Theorem for arbitrary smooth projective schemes over a field of characteristic zero with birational proper morphism between them? 

As explained by J.C. Ottem, the curves of degree $6$ are contained in a cubic. Let us assume that the surface is smooth, so you can see the cubic surface as the blow-up of six points in $\mathbb{P}^2$ with no $3$ collinear and not all on the same conic. The surface $X$ has Picard group generated by $L$, the preimage of a line in $\mathbb{P}^2$, and by $E_1,\dots,E_6$, the exceptional divisors. The trace of an hyperplane is the anti-canonical divisor, $-K_X=3L-E_1-\dots-E_6$. $1)$ To obtain degree $6$ rational curves in $X$, you take a conic of $\mathbb{P}^2$ not passing through the points. It is equivalent to $C=2L$. You can thus see that no quadric of $\mathbb{P}^3$ contains it, because $C$ it is not equivalent to $-2K_X$. There is a cubic $X'$ which contains $C$ is and only if $-3K_X-C=7L-3E_1-\dots-3E_6$ is effective. Intersecting this system with the line $2L-E_1-\dots-E_6+E_i$, we obtain $-1$, so the system should contain the $6$ lines, which is not possible. Hence, the cubic $X$ is the unique one which contains $C$. However, there are quartics containing $C$, because $-4K_X-C=10L-4E_1-\dots-4E_6$ is effective. This can be seen by taking the union of two general quintics of $\mathbb{P}^2$ with $6$ double points. These curves are other rational sextics of $\mathbb{P}^3$. The system $-4K_X-C$ being moreover base-point free, the ideal of $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ is generated by the cubic and equations of degree $4$. You can do this easily in coordinates for a given curve, but this takes time. $2)$ To obtain degree $6$ curves of genus $1$, you can take a cubic of $\mathbb{P}^2$ passing through three of the points, i.e. $C=3L-E_1-E_2-E_3$. The same type of calculation gives you the ideal. You can of course continue with all curves of degree $6$. If you want more details on the type of the curves you obtain on the cubic surface, see "Weak Fano threefolds obtained by blowing-up a space curve and construction of Sarkisov links" by S. Lamy and myself, especially Proposition 4.2. 

For a linearly reductive group $G$ over $k$ we consider the bounded derived category of finite dimensional representations $D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$. Is the Grothendick group $K_0(D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$ finitely generated? 

Kapranov showed that for a quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ there is a tilting bundle. For example if we consider a vector space $V$ of dimension $n=4$ and $\mathbb{P}(V)$ then the tilting bundle is $\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{O}\oplus \mathcal{O}(-1)\oplus \sum_{+}(-2)\oplus\sum_{-}(-2)$. Now $\omega^{\vee}_Q=\mathcal{O}(2)$ so what is $\mathrm{Ext}^k(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{T}\otimes \mathcal{O}(2))$? This should be zero for $k>0$... 

Suppose we are given two smooth projective varieties $X$ and $Y$. Maybe this is elementary but what is the Chow ring $CH(X\times Y)$ in terms of $CH(X)$ and $CH(Y)$? 

Suppose we are given a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$ with an action of a finite group $G$. Suppose $\mathrm{gldim}(A)$ is finite. What is the relation between $\mathrm{gldim}(A)$ and $\mathrm{gldim}(A^G)$ ? Is $\mathrm{gldim}(A^G)$ finite too ? Such algebras occur for example when on considers a smooth projective variety over $k$ with an action of a finite group $G$. If $X$ has a $G$-equivariant tilting bundle $\mathcal{T}$ then $\mathrm{End}_G(\mathcal{T})=\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{T})^G$ would be such an $k$-algebra as above... 

Is it possible to say what surfaces occur as minimal models of surfaces of general type with $K_0(S)$ finitely generated and $H^q(S,\Omega^p_S)=0$, for $q\neq p$? 

Is there a comlete discription of algebraic groups having only finitely many irreducible representations? ( giving some references would be very kind ) 

Suppose we are given an algebraic group $G$ (linearly reductive). Let $D^b(Repr(G))$ be the bounded derived category of finite dimensional algebraic representations of $G$. I am intressted in tilting objects for this category. Is there something known...some reference or articles treating this problem? 

Consider the blowup $X$ of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at a single point $p$. Then, Orlov showed that there is a semiorthogonal decomposition $D^b(X)=\langle e,O_X,O_X(1),O_X(2)\rangle$, where $O_X(i)$ is the pullback of $O_{\mathbb{P}^2}(i)$, and $e$ can be taken to be $i_*O_E(-1)$, where $i:E\rightarrow X$ is the inclusion of the exceptional divisor. The objects $e,O_X(i)$ are in fact all exceptional, so their direct sum should be a tilting object for $D^b(X)$. But I dont see why for example $Ext^k(e,\mathcal{O}_X(i))=0$, for $k>0$ ? 

Now, with this lemma and the classification of centralisers of linear elements in $Bir(\mathbb{P}^2)$ made in $URL$ you get that any action of an ininfite-divisible abelian group extends to an action of an algebraic group. 

There are plenty of other examples of birational involutions of $\mathbb{P}^3$ which are known. For the moment, no precise classification as in dimension $2$. However, the following preprint of Yuri Prokhorov gives a first nice step toward a classification: Yuri Prokhorov, "On birational involutions of $\mathbb{P}^3$" $URL$ In dimension $2$, we can say if two involutions are conjugate only by looking at fixed points. When the curves pointwise fix a curve of positive genus, the curve has to be the same (easy argument), but this condition is in fact sufficient (hard argument, only follows from classification). The same works for any order, looking carefully at the fixed points of all powers (see J. Blanc, "Elements and cyclic subgroups of finite order of the Cremona group." Comment. Math. Helv. 86 (2011), no. 2, 469-497, $URL$ In dimension $3$, we can have the same discussion, replacing fixed curves of positive genus with fixed surfaces which are not birationally ruled (other surfaces can be contracted by birational maps). The article of Yuri Prokhorov studies the case where such fixed surface exists. 

Let us consider a diffeomorphism of a compact real manifold (complex manifold defined over the reals), and let us say that the diffeomorphism is birational. Hence, it extends to a birational map from the complex manifold, and we can associate to it the complex entropy /real entropy as well as Julia/Fatou sets. I presume that there is a relation between the real topological entropy and the real points of the Fatou/Julia sets. Can someone give me a reference where I can find such a relation? For instance, is there an equivalence which says that the real topological entropy is trivial if and only if there are many real points in the Fatou set is large ? (with of course a precise notion of "many", for example with density?) 

Let $M(X)$ and $M(Y)$ be two Chow motives and suppose that $M(X)$ is a direct summand of $M(Y)$. Do we have that $M(X)(i)$ is a direct summand of $M(Y)(i)$, where $M(X)(i)$ is the twist by the Lefschetz motive? 

When one is given a partition $\lambda=(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_r)$ and a locally free sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on for example a Grassmannian variety one can apply the Schur-functor $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{E})$ for some partition $\lambda$. Now take an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ and my question is: What is $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{E}\otimes \mathcal{L})$ in terms of $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{E})$ and $\mathcal{L}$ or $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{L})$? Is ther a formula for computing Schur-functor of tensorproduct? 

Let $G$ be a algabraic group $G$ over a field $k$. We denote by $D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$ the derived category of finite dimensional representations. Under what kind of assmumptions one has a generating object for $D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$? I mean for finite groups this is clear, since one can take all irreducible representations. For reductive groups this is not possible. Are there examples of groups where this can happen? 

For a linearly reductive Group $G$ over a field $k$ one has that the category of finite dimensional representations of $G$ is semisimple. What can one say about the number of simple representations? For what kind of groups the number is finite? 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $k$ and $G$ a linearly reductive group $G$ acting on $X$. Under what assumptions on $k$ or $G$ we have $\mathrm{Ext}^i_G(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G})\simeq \mathrm{Ext}^i(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G})^G$ ? 

I am searching for a reference for the generalized Bloch conjecture for surfaces. I know that it states that $CH(S)$ is finitely generated if and only if $H^q(S,\Omega^p)=0$, for $q\neq p$, but where I can find it? 

For the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}(l,V)$ one has for the dual tautological bundle $\mathcal{Q^{\vee}}$: $\mathrm{Hom}(\sum^{\lambda}(\mathcal{Q}^{\vee}),\sum^{\mu}(\mathcal{Q}^{\vee}))=\sum^{(\mu/\lambda)}V^*$. What do we have for $\mathrm{Hom}(\sum^{\lambda}(\mathcal{Q}),\sum^{\mu}(\mathcal{Q}))$?
