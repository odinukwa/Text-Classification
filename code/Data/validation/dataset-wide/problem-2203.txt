In Sachin's farewell's match, I saw a quote in Cricinfo that Dhoni can hand-over the captaincy to Sachin to honour him like he did that for Saurav. 

If rain fall a full day on final matches of a big tournament, then the teams will be declared joint winners. This is the rule on current ICC champions trophy. But, in 2002 ICC Champions Trophy final between India and Srilanka, when the result was not able to find as the minmum number of overs required for DL method was not bowled, the match was rescheduled to the next day. But, the same story continues on next day, then both the teams were announced joint winners. Source -wikipedia. 

The players are given points and rankings by ICC by following basis: For a batsman, the factors are: 

I don't know whether it would happen or not. My question is, What happen if two athletes touched the finish rope at the same time in running(irrespective of distance either it may be 100m or long distance)? How the winner will be decided? Will they run again for a shorter distance? (like super over in cricket, tie breaker penalty shoot out in football). 

A dropoff, but not a great one, especially considering these are the equally matched (weeds out badly matched blowouts). And to reapply back to your initial question, in those past (almost) two decades, 17 of the 40 extra time games (43%) were decided in ET. Though the sample size isn't amazing, and we also haven't looked at other competition levels, such as other national team tournaments, domestic team cups, or continental club competitions... it seems rather reasonable to at least estimate between about 30-60% of extra time matches are decided in the extra time period. Among those... the past two World Cup finals. 

as the track record for the 1500. And $URL$ indicates the current Olympic trials are at Hayward. If some are like me were just as unclear on some of the others, seems they could be: WR: World Record AR: America Record MR: Meet Record (at the location... this specific competition\event?) WL: World Leader (for the year) AL: America Leader (for the year) OS: Olympic something or Official Speed??? Why use the quirky track abbreviation I know not. But I can't get the links you gave to show the records anymore, they're all blank. So maybe this whole topic is gone to history 8-) 

The logo is missing due to the contract between Star India and BCCI. According to that contract, the star India logo will only be shown on the arms of the jersey for Asia cup. 

Stump cameras were first used in 1992 cricket world cup, a tournament of several innovations in modern cricket like colored player clothing, white cricket balls, black sight screens etc. Source. 

The first Twenty 20 world cup was played in the year of 2007 but, the super over was introduced by ICC only in the year of 2008. When India and Pakistan's match went for tie in the first T20 world cup, Bowl-Out method was used to break the tie. Then, the super-over method was introduced to replace bowl-out method in 2008. 

ie, Domestic matches like IPL is not a matter here. As this question is based on stats and could be modified in future, an answer with link will be better. 

Based on the fivethirtyeight dataset (and hand-analysis of 2016-current), suggestions are that the Pacers became the 79th series loser to outscore the series winner in an official playoff series (1 of those is a BAA playoffs matchup in 1947... there were also 8 ABA matchups, but those are not officially recognized as NBA data). However, the series marked the greatest disparity in 59 years, way back since the (St Louis) Hawks returned the favor to the (Minneapolis) Lakers.

Wizards lost to CLE Cavaliers 2-4, but outscored by 1 points (Note I cannot absolutely ensure the lack of errors... the dataset doesn't indicate where playoff series start and end.... which happened to be a problem in the 56 season, when MNL and STL actually played 4 playoff games in a row.... but turns out the first was a division tiebreaker! I fixed that issue, but there could feasibly be similar small errors, either in computation, or in the dataset itself) (Apologies for team monikers like Seattle Thunder, but it's how the set was laid out to maintain franchise records) And for those wondering: 

The only benefit that the batting team can gain is the batsman's wicket. But, there is a chance for them, if the ball was given crease no-ball in the review, they will get one run and an extra ball to chase the target. 

As per the ICC playing conditions of Umpire reviewing system, still the bowling team will win the match. 

Bowling strike rate means number of balls needed to bowl for a bowler to take a wicket. We can only find the bowling strike rate of that bowler after he takes a single wicket. So, the bowling strike rate is undefined. It will be mentioned as in his carrier profile. For example, take a look at Hashim Amla's profile. His bowling strike rate and average for test matches is mentioned as . He bowled more than 50 deliveries without taking a wicket. 

Though we all do certainly struggle with all of them (even regressing to failing at the basics occasionally after many years of improving golf)... enough to drive (haha) us nuts plenty! Nothing to feel embarrassed about (though we all do feel it occasionally when we hit one of those ugly shots, even as we're all in the same boat). Hopefully shots like this one will remind you it's natural! But that's an idea of what will drive you nuts. And you'll likely seek clubs to help as they match those stages of peak frustration. But you're really fine to give it a try. The exact number or the cost of the clubs at the start don't mean anything at all. You don't need a seven gear Lamborthink with 100 settings to learn to drive. It probably just makes it harder. Likewise with golf. And then SW\Driver\LW will likely be the two or three clubs that you look to seek out sooner than the other irons. The missing irons are just used for more precise distance selection later down the line. You'll already soon be working into the basic idea... the longer the shot, the higher on your list you'll look towards for a club. A 3-hybrid goes a lot further when hit solid than a 9 iron. But a 7 iron vs an 8 iron is (for example) the difference of hitting it 150 yards versus 140 yards. Just not a giant issue worth troubling with until you can hit them solid fairly consistently, as you won't be able to apply it helpfully. Either has a fair shot of getting near or even on a green from that range. For most golfers their first few range sessions and rounds, it'll be more about finding a club or two you feel most comfortable hitting. Many seem to really take a liking to a 7 iron, but each has their own. Whatever you feel gives you the best chance of hitting it good, even if it doesn't go quite as far, is your best friend... both in terms of using fewer shots on the course... and in terms of making it enjoyable. And then work into more and more clubs as you improve and you find need to start tuning the distance aspects. But it sounds like you're ready to give it a go! Hope you hit em well! 

Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest cricket ground by area. The playing area in the  MCG is 172.9m x 147.8m. If we consider the boundary length of the cricket ground, ICC stated about this in the playing conditions that, 

I often see a thing in the cricket match broadcast, that the captains are on the pitch with a match official(commentator) and the toss would be done. Then the two captains will talk about the pitch condition, weather and mainly about playing eleven(who are all in and out). Then the playing 11 from the squad will be listed.(As I saw in the match television broadcast). I want to know, 

It is an action in which a fielder illegally alters the condition of the ball. It'll make the fast bowlers ease to swing the ball in the air. So, it is easy to bowl reverse swing with (early overs)new balls. 

Denver won. Then withdrew 39 months before the game after voters blocked funding. Then Whistler, near Vancouver, was selected. They turned it down due to a government change. Then the US suggested Salt Lake City as a replacement. SLC withdrew their offer due to economics. Then the US suggested Lake Placid. Finally the IOC opted to put it in Innsbruck, Austria just 36 months before the games. Austria had not bid previously. But that gives a suggestion as to what would happen if everyone withdrew (or if something came up that would prevent hosting): a recent host would end up with the games. They have the infrastructure, they have the experience, and they would need less preparation time. It would seem a straightforward fit. (Innsbruck had held the Winter Games 12 years earlier) Similar has happened in the World Cup, when in 1982 Colombia withdrew from hosting the 1986 World Cup after being the only country to have put in a bid. A new bidding round was requested and three countries made entries; Mexico, which had hosted 16 years prior, was unanimously selected. A more recent extreme example is the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco and South Africa made bids. Morocco won. Then Morocco apparently withdrew just THREE month before the tournament over fears from the Ebola outbreak. 2012 co-hosts Equatorial Guinea took it on, even in a climate where many others refused to consider it. So it would seem likely that there would be some combination of a rebid round or private negotiations, and that it would likely end up moving back to a recent host. And if no one still was interested? Well, the IOC could pay to hold the events themselves, without any direct assistance from the cities. Smaller sporting events do this all the time. Or they could cancel. But doubt we'll come to that any time soon, even with the economic benefits of hosting being uncertain. The Olympics are a huge world event, with plenty of attention and fame. Someone will do it. (You can see the entire history of Olympic bids on Wikipedia)
