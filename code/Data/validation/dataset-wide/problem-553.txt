Unlike the rest of the broken bottom bracket questions, my bottom bracket does not make any noise or feel like anything is grinding. There is about 1/2cm of play left to right that i can see on the top chainring. I can definitely feel it being loose. What is the worst amount of damage that I can do to my bike riding like this? (assuming that I dont fall off and die etc because of this little matter) The bracket itself is new(ish) it was installed there about a year ago, but I did ride 50 miles per week on it since. What could have caused this to happen? My best guess right now is that someone did this to my bike because I park it out doors while I am at work. edit: My level of expertise in that area of the bike is pretty low, so here is a video of what is happening: 

I use a contour camera while a bike. Recently all contour videos stopped working, and now their site seems very flakey. Asking this here because Help/Support is broken there. (close if really off-topic) 

Today I was at a bike shop looking at single speed bikes. I rode one, but didn't buy it because I like to bike fast, and this bike must have weighed 2x more than my aluminum road bike (the bike was steel). The store owner told me that the bike weight will not have as great of an effect on my top speed as many other things both on the bike and things I could change about how I ride. Is he right or wrong? Does bike weight make a big difference or is it just very good marketing? 

How can I strip the paint from a bike frame? I tried using a sander and it left really annoying scratch marks on the frame. Is it possible to use a chemical paint stripper to completely remove the paint from the frame? I do not plan to repaint it after stripping the paint. 

I recently replaced my front tire. About 3 days post replacement I noticed that the pressure in that tire was at about 50psi (Its a road bike - I keep it around 120). I pumped it up and hoped for the best for my ride home. I didn't have time to check for the leak that day so I left until the next day. Next day the pressure was fine. about 5 days later it again dropped down to around 50 and I pumped it up. Now its been about 2 weeks and the pressure is holding as well as it usually does. Whats going on here? 

As a non-professional biker who commutes on a bike daily I've been noticing that some factors that I didn't think would make much difference in how fast I go or how quickly I get tired have a much bigger impact. For example, sideways wind. I did not think that a 5-10 mph wind from the side would slow me down as much as it does. Even tail wind doesn't seem to help. Another is cold. I think that I can bike much faster when its 30C outside vs 0C. Its a little bit hard to say though because I can never compare them side by side. This question may seem a bit vague, but what other factors affect performance in either positive or negative ways that one would not necessarily consider as making much of a difference? 

(set quality to HD) I noticed that on the side of my chainrings there is a noticeable gap between the seal and the bottom bracket. So what is going on here? and more importantly can I fix it myself without special tools Can I expect any kind of a warranty from the bike shop who put this in a year ago ? Solved: Took out the bottom bracket. It is fine and so are the cranks. The threads on the frame are not fine though. I need a new frame :P 

Noticed that my rear wheel is pretty un-true and is hitting the brake pad / wont spin freely. Decided that I would try to fix it myself before opting to pay 20 bucks. There is one spoke that is completely loose. The problem is that one i turn the spoke it does not tighten, nor does it feel like its being screwed into anything. (my spoke is straight all the way - i have this wheel) Questions: 1. Can I fix this, or do I need a new spoke / bike mechanic 2. Does riding like this make things worse (aside for greater wear on my brake pads) 

(a) Drag your feet. Dragging your feet works nicely in snow, when your brakes are frozen up and stop working. However, you have to dig in really hard to get much friction. On dry pavement, this is not so good because you feet get thrown back. On gravel and dirt roads it works well, but is a little hard on shoes. 

Range depends on fitness and training, of course, but the actual mileage depends on the bike, the terrain, your speed, and how many breaks you take. One way to increase your range is to put forth more effort into your ride to work by going faster. Another way is to gradually increase your distance per day. In addition to fitness and training, you can increase range by moving to a more efficient bike and/or tires. For example, you may be able to add more air to your tires, move to thinner or smoother tires (from 2.25x26 to 1.75x26, for example), keep your chain lubed, or even move from a mountain bike to a road bike. As you get into longer rides, you can extend your range by taking occasional breaks and maintaining a comfortable speed. On a multi-hour ride you can pace yourself properly and go a lot farther. 

A USB battery pack works well, and can be charged with a solar charger on a multiday trip if electricity is not available. $URL$ 

(b) Turn into grass, ditch, etc. When you're bicycling along out of control, with no or insufficient brakes, it's usually easy to pull off into the ditch (unless you're in the city), and the grass will slow you down. As you are coasting along in a ditch, you might be lucky enough to encounter a driveway which will slow you down really fast, although possibly not as fast as it slows down the bicycle. It's not too bad to bump into a chain link or privacy fence, but barbed wire should be avoided. You can also turn uphill sometimes, if there is room, and trade speed for elevation. (c) Jump off (if necessary). I have actually only jumped off in out-of-control situations rather than brake failures, but it does a nice job of stopping the bicycle driver if not the bike itself. This is difficult to do if you have your feet clipped into the pedals, and is not recommended at high speeds unless it seems really, really necessary, as in the case of a rapidly approaching cactus. I have tried all of these. 

If you have a bag under your seat, you can put a light on that. There are also small LED lights that work well on helmets. 

It will add a little stress to the shock and possible make it wear more than normal, but it shouldn't be a problem if there's not a whole not of weight in the bag. Don't over tighten the hose clamps, and check it occasionally to make sure it doesn't slide down into the brakes. The rubber under the hose clamps is definitely a good idea. 

REI and other outdoor stores sell Sea to Summit lightweight dry sacks. They're similar to the rubberized dry bags used in kayaking and diving, but they're made of light weight nylon. They come in several sizes. They're a little more reliable than zip-locks and trash bags, which can mysteriously acquire holes and tears. There are probably other brands too, but keep in mind that ordinary stuff sacks are not waterproof. 

You should: a. Stop and take a picture of the snake. You'll need to stop well ahead so you don't scare the snake. b. Keep going in a straight line and don't worry it. It won't bite you. Snakes need to be coiled up somewhat before they strike, and a person moving on a bike doesn't present a good enough target for them to strike anyway. If you run over it, it probably won't kill the snake unless it's a very small one. 

A regular road tire will work fine, but you should keep it inflated and not press the roller bar up against it overly hard. But there is no disadvantage to getting a really cheap tire and using it on the trainer -- it will work just as good as an expensive racing tire.
