Find the center of your stem and mark it near (or across) the clamp opening with the edge of a piece of masking tape. Find the easiest to measure location on your drop bar. 

Details: The front wheel repair (called "truing") should be around $20 plus another dollar or so to replace the broken spoke. While I haven't used hockey tape, others have had success with similar cloth tape as long as you're not buying extremely cheap stuff. You'll get more padding with standard synthetic handelbar tape (contains a bit of foam or synthetic cork) which starts around $8. By watching various youtube videos, you can wrap these yourself very easily. (Also, cheap cloth tape will be more messy and sticky and won't be as easy to unwrap and start over.) A reputable, friendly, quality bike shop will help you get your bike in safe, rideable shape for the least amount of money possible. Insist on the bare essentials for a safe ride, but listen to anything that they say is a true hazard. Technically, you can ride a bike frozen in a single usable gear, but a few affordable tweaks of the drivetrain and replaced cables can mean riding a bike that is much more enjoyable and capable of taking you anywhere you want to go. Given your bike and needs, a basic $50 tune up will get them to look at and repair the necessities which wouldn't include the wheel repair and handlebar tape mentioned above. Remind them you're on a budget and are going to try to do some improvements (handlebar tape) on your own. Showing this initiative sometimes helps. Be wary of anyone that steers you toward purchasing an entirely new bike. A good shop will have low-budget options and might even secretly do a few tweaks and fixes out of pride and a sense of responsibility to someone who is giving such a lovely old bike, new wings. 

Being rigid, stiff or having bad timing with any of that will cause harsher landings with or without a bike. Trials riders dropping from large heights extend the rear wheel and have that land first with their legs absorbing the landing with the front wheel landing a bit later. Trying to refine your technique with smaller jumps will help by focusing on the sequence of things to make you and your bike act like a big spring: 

You can certainly switch to a more appropriate tire. Schwalbe Big Apples are a popular choice -- I use their 26x2.0 tires on my mountain bike. They roll well on asphalt, and are quite functional on packed dirt and gravel. They're not suitable for loose dirt/gravel, rocks, roots, etc, you'll need a knobby mountain bike tire for those. The only real downside to this plan: If you intend to ride your bike in the city, and often ride trails as well, you'll quickly tire (pun intended) of switching between your mountain tires and your city tires. If you reach that point, you might consider buying a separate set of wheels and keeping the mountain tires mounted on one and the city tires on the other. 

Ensure the axle is properly placed in the dropout and the quick release is firmly closed. If it's even a little loose, the axle can shift a bit and cause the rotor to be misaligned with the caliper. 

Hold the chain in one hand so that a few links are exposed as a small loop. One of these links should hold the newly-inserted pin. The portion of the pin to be removed should be facing towards you. Grab the pin with the pliers so that the pin & pliers are perpendicular. A quick, sharp, opposite direction twist of both wrists should snap the pin. There will be resistance, but it will snap. 

The Pearl Izumis are my current favorites. They're far from perfect, but they suck less than other gloves I've tried. BTW -- it sounds like you may have a fit problem with the bike, not the gloves. No glove will compensate for a poorly fitting bike. Get a professional fit from a local bike shop. 

Jan Heine & crew at Bicycle Quarterly recently reported the results of their wind tunnel research. A summary is available online, but the full results are only available in the printed journal. 

+1 on the recommendations to bring tools and at least two tubes. Also +1 on the recommendation to bring a second set of cycling shorts. At a minimum, bring a second set of padded liners (assuming your shorts have detachable liners). Mounting the saddle on day 2 with a cold, wet, soggy liner is unpleasant at best. Consider bringing fizzy water tablets (such as Nuun). In addition to providing much-needed electrolytes, they help mask the taste of any hose water you get along the way. You'll probably need a pair of padded gloves. You'll be spending a lot of time holding the handlebars, and your hands will definitely get tired (and possibly raw) if unprotected. Ibuprofen is your friend after a long day in the saddle. 

You can practice making the bunny hop more of a fluid movement. Imagine a jump without a bike over something quite tall: 

Yes, I'd say there are structural reasons for those lines being roughly parallel and it is not arbitrary. (Though the usefulness of my answer depends a bit on my interpretation of your phrase "nearly so.") I think the similar angles of the tubes you mention has most to do with the strength of triangles and the design of the classic and ubiquitous "diamond" bike frame design which utilizes those triangles such that they accommodate the wheel size that is currently popular in a structurally sound configuration. The diamond frame also has some economy of materials - aiming to draw straight lines from point to point, creating those triangles efficiently. There is novelty and utility in other designs (step-through frames, folding bikes) but there are trade-offs and considerations that prevents the geometry choices from being arbitrary. 

You may want to considered a hybrid system that utilizes a battery store that the generator feeds into so you can work within the limitations of the hub generator, but supplement it with additional battery light(s). Generally, this sort of thing is for recharging gadgets and not necessarily running additional lights. $URL$ I'm certain there are electrical experts that could answer if the hub is just a trickle charger for a battery during daylight hours or what the limitations of such a system are based on voltage/amperage/ohms requirements for the various devices. There's also probably some concern around how the battery lights connect to the system. More of an alterative to investigate instead of a clear answer. 

Work a bit on smaller bunny hops - maybe up and down a curb - until you can start to feel yourself landing with a bit less force or until you get a sense that you are anticipating the landing. It was easier for me to yank and jump higher, but it took a while for me to learn how to jump in such a way that I was landing more gracefully and not thrashing my bike, body and wrists. The finesse and feel takes longer but is worth it! Everything happens in such a short period of time it's a little tough but you'll start to feel what works and what doesn't. 

Poland-based company "efneo" is developing a three speed crankshaft gearbox: $URL$ This product will allegedly ship next year. 

I'm 6'2", 250 pounds. I've ridden a Brooks Cambium C17 (carved) for the past couple of years on my road bike. I've completed one 1200K (~745 mile) ride, two 1000K (~621 mile) rides, numerous other randonneuring rides and countless commutes. In addition to being comfortable it's also weather resistant (important for me as I ride mostly in the Seattle area). I almost always wear padded biking shorts, so keep that in mind. +1 to all suggestions to get a professional bike fit. Proper bike fit is a game of millimeters, and many of the parameters are interrelated in subtle ways. Regarding tires: I understand your motivation for sticking with the knobbies. If you do decide to switch, consider Schwalbe Big Apples. A few years ago I put 2" Big Apples on my 26" hard-tail mountain bike commuter. It made it feel like a completely different bike. They roll well on asphalt and they good for light non-technical trail riding. 

In the US it varies by state. Here in Washington State, a bike on the road is considered a vehicle, while a bike on a sidewalk or crosswalk is considered a pedestrian. From RCW (Revised Code of Washington) 46.61.755: 

+1 on the zip ties and power link recommendations. I once saw a photo of an emergency field repair to a broken chainstay using only Popsicle sticks and zip ties. 

I've done it a few times on Shimano nine speed chains (for road bikes and mountain bikes) with no problems. Are you sure it's the correct pin? Are you sure it's inserted fully? If it's correct and fully inserted, then the gap cut into the pin should be fully visible outside the link. Here's how I do it: 

Can you tell if the pain is from pressure or abrasion? If it's pressure, then the it's probably because it was your first long ride. It takes a while to get your butt "battle hardened" for longer rides. Sadly, one quickly loses this after a week or two off the bike. If it's abrasion, then check the saddle to see if anything is rubbing during your pedal stroke. Also check your shorts/pants for fabric seams that could cause issues. Finally, check your saddle height. If it's a bit too high then your hips will rock as you pedal, causing abrasion and leading to unhappiness. +1 to @batman's suggestion of padded bike shorts. You can also get a bike-specific padded liner and wear it in lieu of underwear under normal shorts/pants.
