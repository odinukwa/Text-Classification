Take breaks. Whether taking a break to do one of the above exercises, or just to walk around, a break gives your eyes a chance to relax. Try to break at least for a minute or two once an hour. Position monitor correctly. Your monitor should be between 1.5-2.5 feet from your eyes, and 1/2-1 foot lower than the plane of your eyesight. This positioning will help with refraction and will make it easier on your eyes to view the screen. Enlarge text. Moving to a higher text size on editors or a higher zoom level on browsers will reduce the strain on your eyes. Fix lighting. Make sure that your computer screen is set to a brightness level that feels comfortable on your eyes, and try to position external light sources so that they don't interfere with your view of the screen. Lighting can have a big impact on how hard your eyes are working to see the screen. 

I will give you an vague answer. Since, as you stated, you think you have good slow-twitch fibers, which should make you a good marathon runner. The best way to find out, in what area you are better is to run 100 m. How fast were you? How do you feel?. That will give you your answer. There is this good site, where you can learn more about different kinds of muscle fibers, and how they work. As for eating. Just eat healthy. I strongly believe in "If it fits your macros". There are some good calculators online to figure out your macros. Just fill them with some healthy foods, and occasionally(not more than once a week or two) reward yourself with something dirty(if you want), but make sure you are not going over your macros. A great site, to track them is myfitnesspal. As for the "I feel discouraged". How do you think they started? Do you think they woke up one day and just ran 8 km without any effort?. No. Running is something that requires dedication. I was always good at short bursts, one of the best in my school day, but i never was first in marathon running, because i did not even care for it. Oh, and i was almost 100 kg and 190 cm tall. Do outdoor running as much as possible(but do not over do it of course). It is way better than treadmill in every way. If you want to be a jogger you have to be ready for everything, from downhill to uphill. That is why outdoors is better. Run to different places, enjoy the weather etc. Depending on what your goals are, you can train in one or the other area. Do not feel embarrassed. You are already doing more than most, you should feel proud for wanting to do something like this. Your goals are there, fulfill them, and do not let anyone judge you. Push yourself and one day, you also can run 8 km without even breaking a sweat. The only limits we have, are the ones we set ourselves. 

Stop. Drop this idea that you 'have a body type' and need to work a certain way based on this predisposed attribute. Picture the ideal body, the one you wish you had. This is where the variation is; some people will picture an Arnold, some a LeBron, some a Phelps, others a Froning. When you choose your workouts, you will want to adjust them based on this body type, your goal. Obviously your potential is limited to some degree by your height, but in terms of muscle size and appearance you can seek to achieve whatever you view as best. This does not mean it will be equally easy to fit the mold of every body type. A skinny 6 footer will have a much easier time looking like Phelps than Arnold, because his body is currently closer to that point. This does not mean that he can't eventually achieve a very muscular body, just that the distance to this point is greater. Don't limit yourself by classifying your body to be of a certain type. 

First things first, nothing can substitute food. Protein supplements should only be taken when you know you simply can not eat that much. Protein is actually cheaper. Right supplements can actually save you money, if approached in a smart way. A chicken breast that has 20g of protein costs 1-2 euros depending what you are buying. A serving of protein costs .50-1 euro, also depending on what you are buying. That being said, you can not replace (it is not healthy) food, with only supplements. From fish you get many other nutrients. E.g. different fatty acids, like omega-3. For example, instead of eating 2 cans of tuna, i eat 1 can + 1 serving of whey protein. That saves me a little bit of money already. If doing something like this daily, you can actually save a lot. But again, don't completely replace food, just use supplements to aid you a little bit, while still eating real foods. I do believe in the "1 g of protein per pound of body weight", but that is only when you want to build muscle. Also, it is not important to start from the very beginning like this. Just start consistently going to the gym, eat more calories than you burn, but still eat plenty of protein and carbs. 

If you do the clean, stop and hold the position, then do the press, you will not see any advantage over entering that position directly. If you do the clean then transition directly into the press, however, you may see an increase in the amount you can lift, but this will be due to using the momentum of the clean for your lift. The same stationary position will take the same amount of force, regardless of how you got there. I recommend trying for some higher weight presses by doing cleans first, and carefully keeping track of the set position the clean brings you to. If you can do more weight by cleaning first, it is likely you need to shift your normal press starting position to the position you reach from cleaning. 

No. The volume of your workout is not enough for overtraining, and the fact that you took time off confirms your problems are not due to your lifting. See a doctor. Especially due to the fact that you have a preexisting hormonal disorder, your doctor will be the best source of information. 

I've recently been reading about leptin and leptin resistance and I have a question that has been nagging me. It seems like one of the first things that researchers tried after the discovery of leptin was leptin injections in rats to see if it would suppress hunger. Instead, the rats get hungrier and that led people to believe that large amounts of leptin could lead to leptin resistance. My question is, why do steroids (which increase testosterone) work while leptin injections do not work? From my understanding, steroid users cycle usage to avoid resistance; why can't the same be done with leptin injections? NOTE: I don't use steroids or advocate for them. I'm simply wondering why increasing a given hormone seems to work in one situation, but not in another. 

Note that even though the study was for multi-vitamins, I'm assuming that the same standards for manufacturing the pills are carried over into different vitamins/supplements. The only way to not have to make this assumption would be to point to an equivalent study for fish oil and I don't know of one (feel free to upvote/accept someone else if they happen to find one). This does make sense though because whoever produces the highest volume will likely discover the most problems and be more apt to roll out fixes to the manufacturing process. Pills aren't like food/beer/whiskey/wine where quality tends to go up when made in smaller batches. So I'm sure if you just picked up the walmart store brand you'll be fine. Keep in mind that "quality vitamin" just means that the contents of the bottle match what the nutrition facts say they do. In terms of amounts and how much you should be taking you should look into research on amounts used in fish oil studies and I know from experience that fish oil pills do vary in amount of oil per pill, so you should definetly pay attention to this. 

I'll list a few things that could help, but at the end of the day it really comes down to your own ability to decide to eat a certain way. Log your meals/snacks Writing down what you eat makes it easy to figure out a total calorie count at the end of the day, and will also help you to gain a sense of how much you should be eating throughout the day. If you write things down right before you eat them, the desire to not have to write something unhealthy can sometimes be enough to prevent yourself from eating it. Over time, a log can help you see long term trends in your diet and better identify areas you might wish to change. Eat at home When you go out to eat, whether for fast food or restaurant style, its much easier to convince yourself to splurge. Also, even when you purchase something healthy, its likely to be much less healthy than a meal you made yourself. When you go grocery shopping, make sure to go in with the mindset of prepping yourself to make healthy meals; if you don't purchase unhealthy foods there, you prevent yourself from eating poorly at home. Also, shopping while full can help keep your mind on the healthiest foods, rather than the ones you'd like to eat at that time. Establish short-term, reachable goals Shorter term goals (reachable within a couple weeks) can help motivate you while working out, but they also serve a purpose in maintaining a healthy diet. When a goal is within reach, you will likely be able to more easily mentally associate a healthy meal with achievement of that goal. This association can give you the mental strength to turn down an unhealthy meal, as your desire to achieve your goal outweighs your cravings. Tell people your goals This one can backfire if you tell the wrong people (ie ones who don't want you to succeed) but sharing a goal with a friend or coach can give you a stronger reason not to cheat. If you tell a friend you're trying to eat healthy, your desire to not appear a hypocrite will help you not order those fries or that smoothie. Even better, if your confidant is dieting as well, you two can work to push each other in the right direction. As I mentioned at the top, these things may help, but regardless of what you do to ease the effort, eating healthy comes down to your mindset. Take some time to identify the reasons you want to eat healthy, and make sure you remember those reasons. If you still have trouble, try writing them down and posting them on your wall or keeping them in your pocket. At the end of the day, these reasons are what will keep you on track. 

I was told recently that eating meat will cause weight gain. I fail to find any research on this and i call bs, but i am very curious about it. If yes, what would be the amounts (for chicken/fish). Any linked research would be welcome as well. 

shortcut to size is fine BUT, don't follow the supplement and nutrient guides. They are way too focused around supplements. The answer to your problem is easy. Eat more. Track your macros (Macronutrients). Sites like myfitnesspal can be very helpful. To know what is your daily caloric need, try googeling "Caloric calculator" I can not recommend one or another, there are many different ones, some get more specific and give better answer etc. You need to not only consume a lot of protein, but carbs and fat as well. For example, for bulking i go 200G of protein 200G of carbs 80G of fat daily (This is only me, your values will be different). From your weight, i would say you need about 134G (Bodyweight(kg)*2) of protein a day, and a lot more carbs. I used to know a guy who drank chocolate milk every day to bulk, because he could just not get enough carbs from foods. So to conclude. You need to eat more, track your macros. If possible, follow the workout routine (4 days a week). This program is pretty good for beginners, since it offers variety, and gives you an good idea of what a program should look like, once you start putting together your own.
