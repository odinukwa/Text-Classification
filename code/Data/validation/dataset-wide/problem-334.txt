If you manage to completely "weaponize" the beasts (e.g.: with some kind of "remote control" capable of acting real-time on the beasts, at least acting on their punishment/reward system) then all "normal" weapon escalation mechanisms will apply, otherwise they would be used only under high control (think about Hannibal elephants or dogs used mainly at short lash). Update: I now realize Your question was geared about controlling usage and, possibly completely ban super-beast usage via international treaties or something such. Details (as always) heavily depend on specific characteristics of the society You are modeling. Only a few general remarks can be made. 

Other answers have very nice ideas, I just want to point out a few things that may not be obvious (and a quick perusal of previous answers didn't show them up). 

Interpretation "naive" dwellers can do to all this is open to speculation (after you decide what configuration you like most). @Innovine: asked where goes the energy captured by sphere. Dyson spheres are built for that exact purpose: harness all energy produced by a star. This means radiant energy should be converted in some other kind of energy and shipped somewhere to be used (possibly leaking something in the form of infrared radiation). If this is not true (i.e.: the transformation/transport system is not working anymore for any reason) then all energy will be converted to heat and the sphere will start radiating (black body radiation) till it reaches an equilibrium between received energy and radiated energy (unless heat destroys it first, of course). At that point you would have a sphere much bigger than photosphere radiating the same amount of energy as black body (more or less, it would depend on sphere material, to a point), which means it would radiate at a much longer wavelength, most likely in the deep infrared. Details depend on how big the sphere is (how far from star). 

This means changing a single gene will change many characteristics, not a single one. For this reason evolution tends to diverge, even if some global characteristics seem to be the same. Cetacean fins do not resemble fish's and neither are similar to penguin wings, beyond the (very) general shape dictated by function. Full explanation would be a bit too long to be done here, but my understanding is once two (vertebrate) branches diverge there won't be an easy way to make them really converge again but for some specific traits which may be mandatory in a certain habitat. This does not hold true for Arthropods, but they are confined to a somewhat lower complexity due to the "simpler" matching between genes and bodily characteristics. 

The most important reason would be to shorten distances. In a tall city you can fit a lot more room within walking distance. @JonBloggs lists a lot of excellent reasons not to do this, one of which is that elevator systems for tall buildings are complex and difficult. This is the result of everybody having to go to ground level to get anywhere. If you build exits and transportation paths at multiple heights this will be improved. In addition to the street net, you will have connections at, say, every 25 stories. Both pedestrian and motorized. With ramps leading up and down too. Finding the right bus to where you want to go would need computer assistance. People living low down will not get much sunlight and this will NOT be popular. Expect resentment. If you have cheap power, you can set up fake sunlamps. Fire will be a serious problem. No wood allowed. Paper severely restricted. Plastics? Call the cops! We are already building tall. In the most crowded cities, buildings are as tall as we can make them (or could, when they were new) This is not going to end. [Edit add] Oh, I almost forgot: Aqueducts! Put the water supply at the level of the tallest buildings, makes plumbing so much easier. 

Mirrors. For use in sun ovens. Also to make solar panels more effective. Since mirrors are pretty fragile, it depends on how nomadic these survivors are. 

Ships Rivers have been important to civilization since the beginning because sailing up and down the river is much easier than trudging over land. A standard bridge will stop ships from passing! Everybody up-river is going to hate you and try to destroy your bridge/city. You can build a drawbridge or something, but you don't want to build houses on a drawbridge. 

We have not been able to fit these two together. One of the reasons for this is that we have not been able do experiments that test both at once. Objects that are small enough to have quantum effects are not noticeably affected by gravity. At least not strongly enough that we can distinguish between different theories of gravity. Our other theories (eg. electromagnetism) can be fit with one or the other, but not both at once. Black holes changes things. Here gravity is very strong and even electrons will feel the pull. If we would be able to bring along both a neutrino source and a neutrino detector, we would learn much about these mysterious particles. However, at current or near-future tech levels neutrino detectors are very massive and not something you can move off-Earth. Even without that I am sure there are numerous experiments we could do with a humble electron ray that will be very useful. The main experiment I see done is sending a laser or a ray of electrons in very close to the event horizon, and putting a detector where it comes out. Useful results would be angle of deflection and time taken for the journey. Maybe also how spread out the beam has become. If the hole is rotating, sending beams both with and against the rotation will be interesting. Why humans? This is about science, which means we won't know in advance what experiments we want to perform. Results of the one experiment will suggest new physics theories. These will suggest new experiments to perform. A machine cannot do this. (Unless you have powerful AI) If there are no humans on the spot, the results will have to be sent to Earth and new commands sent back. This will take too much time and the black hole will move away before we are done. I suggest a crew consisting of a mixture of astronauts and physicists. Both will need to have a good understanding of the other side, but in the end they are different in their goals. The astronauts will want to keep everybody alive and return home in one piece. The physicists will want to perform more experiments. More! MORE!! Other answers have suggested sending several unmanned probes instead of a manned one. I suggest a manned ship carrying many unmanned probes. The ship stays prudently far away from the radiation, the probes go closer, not close enough for tidal effects to destroy them, but definitely into hard radiation areas. Parting gift. The time comes when the hole moves away and we have to go home to Earth. Leave something behind for aliens to discover, maybe something like the Pioneer Plaques and Voyager Golden Discs. The hole will be a scientist magnet from every civilization it passes nearby and a good meeting spot. Maybe we will find an alien artifact already there... 

Problem with all possible "solutions" of such a problem is either you opt for some kind of "final solution" (e.g.: castration) for the culprit (with non-null risk to punish an innocent) or risk of reiteration is very high, even after long detention periods (a particularly bloody episode can be found here, unfortunately in Italian). Prevention is very difficult mainly because the amount of "false positives" would be very high and following each case would be impossible. One of the reasons why many crimes seem to be increasing (and, in certain places, they are) is the weakening of "social control"; meaning we live in a world where the mass of people surrounding us know effectively nothing about us (and vice-versa, obviously). This puts us in a condition of almost unprecedented helplessness as we don't have an inkling about trustworthiness of the person in front of us. With current technologies, OTOH, it wouldn't' be unthinkable to have some comprehensive database recording most of our life and giving, in realtime, information about reliability of each person, possibly divided by subject. A particularly "dangerous" individual could even be flagged as such so that people would avoid being alone with him (unless looking for trouble). This is nothing different from very small villages where "everyone knew everyone" and where, unsurprisingly, crime rate is lower than in most urban areas. Downside of such a scheme is the absolute lack of privacy and, much more nefarious: who will fill the "database"? This scheme will probably fall into the "Utopian" class, but that never stopped fiction writers ;) 

IMHO you are approaching the problem from the wrong vantage point. In order to be able to act on a planetary mass from far enough to avoid tearing it to pieces (i.e.: to have a reasonable pull also on the "far part" of the planet, otherwise you risk ripping away a piece of planet) you need a comparable mass, something between Earth and Moon mass. If you compress it to "manageable size" you risk ending up with a very high surface gravity which will just squash your tug-ship. In any case your "tug" needs to have engines powerful enough to move that mass and the mass of the planet trying to fall on it, accelerating both fast enough to prevent the planet from "catching up", i.e.: with the same acceleration the planet have, so that distance remains constant (a difficult exercise, if you ever tried to "tug" a magnet with another one). If you have engines that powerful it would probably be easier to apply them directly to the planet. There's a problem in applying such a force on a planet without destroying it. A very large floating mass (about 100km radius) could be pushed down in the Ocean for about 100m could provide reasonable push "gently" enough. Of course synchronizing push with planet rotation and gently enough to avoid disruptive tsunamis is another exercise left to the reader ;) A more viable plan could be to mount the engines unto a (large) metallic asteroid (or an asteroid fleet) and have it (them) repeatedly approach planet and be deflected by planet gravity. This schema trades a high pull (not easily obtainable without destroying the planet) for a series of smaller pulls, possibly less damaging. Before you are able to do such a thing you need to "invent" a reactionless engine along with a huge energy generator. 

Ancient Artifacts The only way to handwave something properly is by saying nothing. The people in the present of your story simply don't know how things work. Once upon a time there was a Golden Era. People then knew how to make the most amazing things! Some disaster happened and the knowledge was lost. Even the knowledge of the what the disaster was has been lost. But the devices remain. Unique ancient artifacts nobody understands. Fortunately, one of the devices that remain is an automated factory, making "golems". People know that they should put raw materials on once side of the factory and some time later "golems" will appear on the other side. Nobody dare tamper with this factory. 

As you said, hybrids end up wrecking the ecosystem. Most Watchers would consider that a bad thing. However, some Watchers don't like these experiments and want to sabotage them. Spreading children around is a low-cost high-impact sabotage. Also, it takes time to "explode", giving the perpetrators time to leave the crime scene. Alternatively, these beings are closely modeled on human beings, too closely. And temptation is hard to resist. (Humans are a randy bunch) Watchers do also have superhuman abilities, but have strong programming regulating their use. Their children have lower abilities, but no inhibitions against using their powers. Also, they have less control,leading to accidents. 

Bureaucrats needed. Ruling and administrating the galaxy is such a chore! Why can't somebody else do it? Hm, over there is a planet full of beings that actually like ruling! Odd things, but useful. Let's educate them so they can take over the job. 

Having a large group with good communications generally makes language change slower. In a low-tech setting this means nomadic tribes with friendly relations and trade with each other. Trading spouses helps too. Class differences breed class accents, which becomes language change when the lower classes imitate the upper and the upper avoid lower-class speech. So, avoid social classes. A strong singing tradition preserves language. 

I don't think that, with modern technologies, this double-identity can be kept for any extended period of time. "Witness Protection Programs" are notoriously difficult and expensive to keep up. There are, however, many good reasons to try. 

Main difficulty is such methods are deeply ingrained in cellular metabolism; it is unclear what other effect they would have on overall building of complex organism as we are. Please note we have much less genes than phenotypic characteristics (by orders of magnitude), this means a single gene has effects on many areas (this is different, e.g. in arthropods); it is not possible to change a single trait in a complex vertebrate. 

You may want to investigate in some non-aggressive alternative to harpoons. Depending on the technological level of your world (you mentioned Kevlar, so I assume we're not in a Medieval setting) a nice alternative could be synthetic Setae that have a large adhesive force on almost all solid surfaces (Teflon being one of the few exceptions); this adhesive force can be "switched off" almost instantly by varying the incidence of the nanostructures making up the adhesive surface. As for your questions: 

As always is the case drawing a line about something complex. It is obvious a newborn is unable to take any decision, while an adult should be free to take any decision he pleases (as long as he/she doesn't violate a law or something). In the middle there is an infinite graduation and allowing the "right" amount of freedom, commensurate with discerning capability is a very hard job. Something similar is in order here. Of course bad genetic alterations should be corrected (think Dawn syndrome or worse) and it's clear (to me) "trivial" characteristics like hair color or breast size shouldn't be meddled with. In the middle there's the ocean of things that may be thought as a "defect", but may also be an asset, in some circumstances. If history serves we will see that "trivial" matters will be the most requested in practice. Other things will be rarer and thus push on the governments would be much less. It is arguable homosexuality impairs procreation, so I would suggest governments of overcrowded nations will leave this characteristic alone (if not "condemned" by some powerful religion). Governments pushing for high birth rate would push for "correcting" this "obvious flaw". Most likely result will depend if government gives in to the request for "trivial" modifications (given the huge push); in that case parents will probably get the "right" to decide. In the opposite case meddling would be "illegal", but a lot of "underground helpers". 

I am fairly certain people will be willing to kill over this. Each company controls the news in their colonies, and will thereby form the majority opinion, but there will be a minority on each side that is holding the "wrong" opinion. Mother against daughter, sister against sister! Dramatic goodness... 

The short answer is that whoever is powerful enough to set up the pocket dimension will be capable of creating whatever weather conditions they want. Which means that you as the author can decide. That being said, we can do some guesses. If the elemental plane of Air contains only air, with no water in it, the atmosphere will probably never contain enough water to create rain. Sure, water will be continuously evaporating, but the wet air will be blown into the plane of Air before it gets wet enough. However, this depends on there being enough air exchanged daily. As the creator you can set this how you want. There is also the ocean to consider. How hot is the water in the plane of Water? Will the local sun have time to heat it significantly before it disappears back into the elemental plane? How wide is the oceans around the island? All this can be changed around as you wish. And then there is the ground. How well does it retain heat during the night? This decides how cold it gets and how much thermal wind you will be seeing. The higher the temperature difference, the more wind. However, this will not be much of a wind. Look at Sea breeze for more info. If you do set up things so that you get rain, it will probably fall at night, probably as a light drizzle. 

It makes more sense if we consider mermaids to be the origin for the siren legend. In this legend sirens/mermaids called to sailors and fooled them into wrecking their boats on reefs or cliffs. Presumably, the sailors then become food for the mermaids. In order for this deception to work, they have to look like beautiful women, and beautiful women have long hair. (At least, that is the easiest way to look beautiful from a distance)
