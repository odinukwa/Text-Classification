So, even on the most relaxed definition, the numbers are far short of claims from EU critics that >75% of our laws are written in Brussels. On a stricter, more natural interpretation the ratio could be <15%. It is also worth noting that similar problems apply to calculations in other (less EU skeptical) countries: 

In another of his regular columns in the Financial Times he describes his own journey with the idea of shareholder value: 

In Tim Harford's book-length argument that some degree of messiness is, contrary to much modern opinion, a good thing, he makes an argument late in the book that applies to the spaces where children play. Modern playgrounds have become dominated by careful design of the playthings and the environment (KFC in the jargon, standing for Kit, Fence, Carpet). The floors are often made from soft rubbery material to reduce the impact of falls and the kit is increasingly designed to be very safe. All this is intended to reduce the possibility of injury to children. Harford argues, however: 

Here is one part of the conclusion relevant to the statistical clarification i made above (I've highlighted the important bits and I quote at length to show the different results from different trials): 

His comments are interesting as they suggest we reached consensus on the ozone hole a little quickly and, once the bandwagon was established a lot of poor science was done (which, despite being a believer in the consensus of global warming he also thinks is happening there). More significantly his comments have been widely reported in climate-related blogs and might be read as arguing that CFCs didn't cause the hole. A more careful reading would be that though most experts think they did, we are no longer clear how. 

And a possible explanation is that the metabolic routes for alcohol digestion don't involve the production of glucose (though, obviously, some booze also contains high glycaemic index carbohydrate so will cause peaks in blood sugar). Is the claim true? Does the alcohol content of drinks make no observed contribution to excess weight? 

So men seem to benefit from marriage (this study didn't look at female mortality). But it is worth noting that quite a lot of the risk seems to explained by known lifestyle differences between married and unmarried people. The trouble with many of these adjustments is that they are intended to estimate the independent effect of marriage. But marriage may directly lower people's desire to smoke, eat unhealthy diets and live with little exercise, so adjusting for these factors may underestimate the benefits of marriage. A more recent review by Kaplan and Kronick in 2006 (paywalled, unfortunately) supports those conclusions. The abstract summarises: 

So the question arises: does it? To be slightly more specific, to nail several possible variants on his claim with a single question and to put the results in context let me ask the question this way: Does oral sex (cunnilingus or fellatio) contribute to the risk of oral cancer? Is the risk significant in the context of other causes of this class of cancers? 

Mass screening for prostate cancer doesn't save lives and probably causes more harm than good. This conclusion defies popular intuition about the benefits of screening in general and the typical practice in the USA. Before examining the evidence it is worth a quick summary of why the popular intuition is wrong here and in many other areas of medical screening. Gerd Gigerenzer and his team reviewed what is known in depth in their paper: Helping Doctors and Patients Make Sense of Health Statistics. The paper should be compulsory reading for anyone discussing medical statistics. One key conclusion (my emphasis): 

The review recognizes that it is not up to the medical community to recommend blanket screening as only the informed patient can weigh up the cost against the benefit. Two key points are worth repeating. Screening isn't costless and the cost of false positives and unnecessary treatment are high. And there is no good evidence that overall mortality is reduced by screening. The intuition expressed by many (especially those lobbyists and politicians who backed away from the original recommendations of the Preventative Services Task Force) is not backed by the hard evidence. This answers both my original question "does screening reduce mortality" and the more specific question now asked about screening in the low risk 40-50 year olds. 

In an article in iNews some British experts have called, among other things, for an enquiry into the overuse of prescription drugs: 

Taleb provides yet more fodder for skeptical enquiry. In the middle of Chapter 16 of Antifragile ("A lesson in disorder") where he is arguing that science isn't the source of practical applications of technology but the product of it, he argues: 

In summary, it looks like life expectancy is still improving but since 2010 at a much slower rate than in the previous decade. So you could, at a stretch, call that a "stall" but it might be more accurate to call it a slowdown. John Appleby, a respected UK health economist, posted this on twitter in response to some of the media noise (original tweet here, but he didn't quote the chart's source): 

For example, for a long time it was assumed that anaesthetics disrupted lipid bilayers in cell membranes (based on correlations with oil solubility and potency, the Meyer-Overton correlation). But this fails, for example, to explain why stereoisomers have different potency. New theories about specific protein interactions were proposed in the 1980s by Franks and Lieb. But, although this is an interesting theory: 

She popularised the idea that we are suffering an epidemic of cancer. The idea has not gone away. Some randomly selected modern comment illustrates the currency of the idea. A 2008 opinion article in the New York Times proposed that "we can stop this epidemic of cancer". The London Evening Standard reports "Modern living to blame for cancer epidemic". A quick Google search will reveal the ubiquity of the assumption that we are faced with an epidemic (though there is some disagreement on the cause). But not everyone agrees. This piece from Reason.com asks "what cancer epidemic?" and quotes an ACS report: 

One huge problem is that results that sound plausible get a lot less scrutiny than unusual results so wrong but plausible results get a free pass on error checking far too often. The article summarises a range of different reproducibility experiments and the results suggest that the majority of results across many fields are not reproducible (it is worth reading the article for all the links to these studies). 

A recent (February 2018) report by the US government Council of Economic Advisors makes the following argument (my highlights): 

Actual summaries to the proper reviews in the medical literature referenced here (original lancet article; full text on ben Goldacre's blog) with this conclusion: 

So, in simple terms, red reduces performance but not in a way people are conscious of. And one of the mechanisms is an unconscious avoidance of harder tasks when given a choice. This clarifies part of the possible mechanisms behind the observations in sporting contests: it isn't that wearing red makes you perform better, it makes your opponent perform worse. The classic paper on this is a paper in Nature (abstract only online, but, for readers in the UK the British Library is your friend) from 2005 (though it assumes that red makes the wearer perform better). The paper uses the fact that some sports randomise colours so removing most of the possible confounding factors from the statistics. Speculating that red may have some residual effect as a primate dominance signal they report significant differences between player performance when players wear red in 4 olympic sports from 2004 (boxing, tae kwon do, greco-roman wrestling, freestyle wrestling). As they report: 

The premise of the question is wrong and the science of electromagnetism suggests why A simple google search for images using the term "birds power lines" will show many pictures revealing birds sitting on power lines such as this one (source is here): 

The data visualization choices made by the IPCC are poor and have the effect of obscuring the differences between model forecasts and observed temperatures. Note: this answer assesses whether the IPCC have done a good job of presenting the comparison of observed temperatures and model projection. This, I think, is what a good skeptic would demand if the purpose of presenting the data is to assess whether the models have any predictive skill. This may not be the intention of the IPCC presentation, of course. Also, I am not assessing the IPCCs conclusions, merely their choices of presentation methods. The key problem the IPCC or other climate modellers have to face is how to present the results of climate projections which contain a great deal of uncertainty. Models don't predict a single path of future temperatures: the short term climate is chaotic and, even if we know all the inputs with precision (which we don't) there are many factors that create many paths into the future. So even a single model will give an ensemble of possible paths into the future. So one key question is how to describe that uncertainty in a visual way that does not misrepresent the nature of the uncertainty. Another problem is that there are multiple scenarios for what will happen in the future. The key ones use different assumptions about how the world will respond to climate change (will we constrain the output of CO2 or just keep producing increasing amounts each year? The initial IPCC chart does a half-assed job of the first problem and a poor job dealing with the second. The chart presents the envelopes of forecasts produced by particular models, which is commendable, but incomplete and it fails to account for the shape of the probability distribution of possible temperature paths (examples of better approaches below). The second problem is that the chart tries to show multiple envelopes from multiple model versions. This just confuses as the envelopes overlap and it is hard to get a clear visual impression of the particular envelope for any one model. In fact the choice of models to show is particularly confusing as the envelopes are shown for the key models from previous IPCC rounds despite the obsolescence of the old models and their irrelevance to whether current models are doing a good job. A better approach, if the goal would be to show one chart for each group of models showing the projections made at each previous report with a comparison of all subsequent actual observations. Small Multiples of this sort are a very effective visualisation technique (see this excellent discussion with many examples at Junk Charts). The IPCC even used this approach when they presented the original AR4 forecasts (why not, it seems reasonable to ask, just repeat these charts in the current report with observed temperatures overlayed?): 

One additional effect that might add to the plausible effects described above is the widespread use of ferroluids in loudspeakers. Ferrofluids are used between the voice coils and the magnets to provide better thermal conduction for the coil (allowing higher power) and also to mechanically damp vibration. It is at least plausible that the distribution and physical properties change slightly with repeated use. Also, the magnetic properties are temperature dependent so will change in use. It is not obvious whether anyone has tried to objectively quantify the effects discussed here, but they are a lot more physically plausible that some audiophile esoteric beliefs. 

The key point here is that even the poor uneducated are more likely to vote democrat. Education may have some tendency to make people more democrat-voting, but this pattern is dominated by wealth, where the wealthy are much more likely to vote republican. Education makes you more democrat-leaning; wealth makes you more republican. But, while postgraduates may be more strongly democrat, the working classes (defined by education and wealth) are not a republican block. 

Cooperation is far more common than any theory based on "cooperate with people like you" would predict The trouble with this question is that is is a very big one which others have written whole books about so any summary will be incomplete and perhaps overly simple. The most important conclusion is that cooperation between people goes far beyond what Haldane's numbers would predict and that reciprocal altruism base on consanguinity is not a good explanation for actual cooperation. There are three key books that describe these ideas well: The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod; The selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins; the Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley (all links to latest editions on Amazon). Haldane's numbers describe the mathematics of rational cooperation from the point of view of genetic success. It makes sense to display some degree of self sacrifice of an individual if their genes are preserved in the other relatives saved by the sacrifice. The theme of Dawkins' book is working out the implications of that view for biological behaviour. But rather too many people read the title and not the book and somehow never get to the penultimate chapter which (in my edition at least) is called Nice Guys Finish First. The chapter gives a summary of the work of Axelrod. Matt Ridley's book explores this theme in more detail. What Axelrod did provides a powerful illustration that cooperation can be very effective for the individual and the group in ways that are far more significant for real behaviour than preferential behaviour to relatives. His basic idea was to create a computer model of individuals who would compete against each other in interactions with a Prisoner's Dilemma style payoff. The prisoner's dilemma is just about the simplest description of a two player game where the results are not trivial and where something like a real-world tradeoff between short and long term payoffs matters (the rational strategy in a single game is selfish, but if you know you will play repeatedly, you can do much better if you are not selfish). The beauty of the very simple game is how it captures the essence of some real interactions between people where the result is not zero-sum (i.e. the size of the pie can get bigger or smaller depending on how you play so there is more at stake than just what share you get). Axelrod ran a simulation of many competing strategies for playing the game and ran competitions to see if experts in computer science, game theory and biology could develop effective strategies. The successful algorithms were allowed to grow in number; the less successful killed off in a long game with many rounds (in modern language he created a simulated ecosystem where individual bots with a particular strategy could recognise other bots they had interacted with before). The critical finding is what sort of strategy is successful in the long term: a selfish one, a greedy one, an altruistic one, a complex one and so on. Naively "nice" algorithms get exploited by nasty ones but if the population is all nasty, nasty ones don't do well either. Amazingly one of the simplest algorithms possible often comes out on top: tit-for-tat. It has the characteristics (as described by Dawkins) of 

This provides a relatively concise summary of the case in the USA. Second Update A recent article by the previously mentioned Lynn Stout has summarised the case in more depth (and has written a whole book, The Shareholder Value Myth, on the topic). Summarising some of the previously discussed analysis she argues: 

Is he right? What's the evidence? Does illiteracy in the young correlate with criminal behaviour later? 

She further argues that the idea of shareholder value is itself incoherent and there is little or no evidence that firms who have pursued it have performed well. In short shareholder value is a bad theory of how to manage the firm; a legal fiction; and a stick used by anti-business activists to demonise capitalist activity. 

The European Union is, among many other things, a large free trade block with few barriers to cross-country trade within it. The United Kingdom has voted to leave the EU and is currently trying to negotiate the terms of that departure including the future terms of trade with the remaining block. This isn't going well. The future options for trade range from staying in the "single market" (that is preserving the current trading terms as some other non-EU countries like Norway and Switzerland do) to just leaving the union with no deal at all and reverting to the default World Trading Organisation (WTO) terms of trade (see this Economist explanation of what this means). One of the reasons for problems in the negotiations is that the government is split on which option is best. Some argue that no-deal (ie WTO terms) will be a disaster; others seem to think it is the best option. So I was surprised to read the following aside in an article arguing that the market for financial services will not suffer much as the UK's position is so strong that the EU need the City of London more than the City needs the EU:
