The reason for needing the secret entrance was lost, then the secret was lost. Perhaps it was built when the family were Catholic under a Protestant monarch (or vice versa). A fairly common scenario at various points in British history. The entrance then became an entrance for the kids when they were playing but due to lack of maintenance or an accident they were banned from using it and the secret was never passed to the next generation. The secret could also easily have been lost when the house changed ownership. Perhaps it was a servants entrance (the family only used it for illicit affairs so it wasn't much talked about above stairs) and with the loss of the domestic service culture after the war it simply fell into disuse. Surfaces degrade, walls and stairs become unsafe, anything near a river would flood. Notes on lost secrets: When we were doing works on my grandfather's house a few years ago we discovered he had a priest hole. A friend's family bought a big old house and having lived there for a few years opened a disguised door that apparently up until then they hadn't opened, as they discovered an entire extra (servants accommodation) floor. 

A private servitude is not a panhandle. The panhandle implies that the access way is owned by the second (accessed/benefited) property, a private servitude is owned by the first (burdened) property but the owner of the second (benefited) property has the right to access their property using that route. I can only find it in Scottish and US law, dating from 1889 and resulting from a route being used "since time immemorial" and hence being maintained as a right. The usual reason for a panhandle on a new property is that the roadside property sold off a plot of land behind their existing building and along with that needed to provide access, hence the panhandle as part of the new building plot. An inaccessible plot has little value and the private servitude rights don't apply as it's a newly independent property and has no history of access. The "time immemorial" clause for private servitudes is similar to the one for public rights of way. Since only a single property is using this route it becomes a private servitude, if the route had been used since time immemorial for the people of village A to travel to village B, it becomes a public right of way. There's another law related to this concept which is easement, it allows access to private land to anyone with a legitimate reason to do so. This law allows access across private land to another area of otherwise isolated private land, it also allows the postman to deliver letters to your door, utility companies to access their services etc. The laws of the various countries that still maintain this concept have drifted over the course of the centuries so there's no point getting into the fine details of the way these laws work now. However the important thing to take away is that the concept of the servitude is Roman in origin. 

It's not very good for the soil It could trigger new growth in many species It's a major waste of natural resources 

What's going to kill him is exhaustion Full plate armour is perfectly resilient against considerably more than brainless biting and scratching, but he's not going to be able to fight more than 50 at the upper end before needing a long rest and some lunch. The shield is not required, nothing is attacking him with anything that would penetrate good armour. He could theoretically take a nap by the side of the road with the zombies wailing at him in perfect safety with appropriately secure armour. 

If you want underground space as fast as possible then infrastructure does exist for generating this. Let me introduce you to the Crossrail Tunnel Boring Machines. Most importantly for your project, they're 7 meters diameter and: 

I'd go with no. Heliostats would only need a restricted range of very slow movement. A quick google shows they tend to be custom built for the situation and only have as much movement as they require for that particular installation. I'll look up the heat resistance of missiles later. Modern high explosives tend to be very stable. 

Your average large dinosaur is going to be much more considerate of its joints and feet than fiction would have them. It's more likely to move with the silence of the elephants than with the thunder of a horse race, if only to reduce the shock to the body from every step taken. 

In that time, shipbuilding has gone, mining has gone, most of the heavy industry has gone, manufacturing has been largely automated, many things that were highly labour intensive have been automated and yet unemployment is again dropping. There's a financial theory that says simply; As jobs are removed by automation, new jobs will rise up to take their place. The population will always be employed, one way or another, we just can't see from here what they're going to do once the jobs we're familiar with are gone. 

Not noticeably. While there's a considerable amount of fur on a tail, like all fur it has a relatively fixed growth rate and a maximum length, it doesn't just keep growing the way head hair does on humans. You may find a slight spike in needs for the sake of seasonal hair shedding if you want to go that way, but it'll be minimal and we're so disconnected from nature at this point it's unlikely your humans would get the appropriate hormonal/temperature triggers. 

It goes on to say that the river Jordan has a ratio of 2:1 which is unusually high, so you're looking at an upper limit of twice the air distance from source to destination as the crow flies. 

Using their radio communication as a time signal, this can be used to find their relative positions on the planet. 

Mostly one sells weapons to governments, explosives as part of weapons or to mining and similar industries. Given appropriate licenses, facilities etc, there's nothing stopping you building up vast quantities of all these things. There's no need to pretend to hide them either, every time a government agency comes round you try to sell them a few thousand units. 

Throw them out of the country Nobody likes mercenaries hanging around when they're not needed, put them back out on the road. The key word being out. It's important to consider who mercenaries are in a middle ages setting. Fundamentally they're foreigners. Apart from the nobles, there isn't really such a thing as a standing army, the nobles fight as part of their duty to the crown, they don't have a choice. The rest of the non-noble army consists of conscripted peasants, the general population of the country, they don't have a choice either. So where do these mercenaries come from? If they were natives they'd be conscripted and part of the army, if they were nobles they'd have to fight by duty. They're foreign professionals, once you're done with them, pay them and put them on the first boat out. Nobles and landowners have rights, peasants do not, foreigners most certainly do not. 

Most of the death rate for elves appears to be wars, in a time of war they'd need a birthrate approximating that of humans just to maintain a viable population around 100 years later. However you're effectively looking at an advanced society in a primitive world. Humans have a lot of children to try to ensure that at least two survive to adulthood to reproduce and continue the species. Elves can be reasonably sure that all their children will survive to adulthood and hence, as in among wealthy westerners, their birth rate will inevitably fall. In spite of, or rather because of, their long lives, when their society was primitive and they were losing children to disease and injury they would have needed to have more children due to the greater age they need to survive to to reproduce. Humans need to survive a couple of decades, elves perhaps a century or more. There's no need to impose any fertility restrictions, just let society take its natural course. The birth rate drops because there's no need to have more children. 

The general theme of this is that the opportunity to downvote only makes a difference in a larger field of candidates. 

All hail the patriarchy. Let me introduce the Severn Bore, these days mostly used by surfers, but such a thing could easily be the judgement of god for those who dare to use boats on the holy river. Your river is only tidal on spring tides, so mostly flows fresh, but the particular combination of tide and current mean that you get a large tidal bore on those tides. The fact that the rest of the time it's perfectly safe to take a boat on the river notwithstanding, to do so is heresy and punishable by drowning by the priests if the wave of god doesn't take you. 

They're actually fairly quick and accurate at the moment. Cost depends on whether you're in a country that scalps you for medical care or one that provides it for free. In the "West", you'd end up with a massively reduced rate of transmission of STIs among intelligent educated responsible people, who would require a test before any sexual encounter, and a moderately reduced rate among the reckless and uneducated. I expect the US would charge people $150 a time for the test kit, it would be flagged on your medical record and future employers would be informed that you once had sex. The rest of the civilised world would get it for free from the local doctor or pay a token fee at a pharmacy. Similar to access to contraceptive pills today. You'd get major campaigns for testing and treatment in African countries who would end up with reduced transmission rates across the population, though not total reduction due to the difficulties of teaching people that having sex with a virgin doesn't cure HIV (this makes me cry). The more religiously oppressive regimes would ban it immediately for encouraging infidelity and probably stone anyone caught in possession of a kit. 

Mouthparts Because a picture of a star nosed mole is what everyone should wake up to on christmas morning. 

Mage towers don't have to defend against mages, in the same way that castles rarely had to defend against kings. It's only once the mage wars kick off properly that you'll have to start considering defence against other mages rather than just the usual stone defences against armed men, requiring them only to be slowed enough for the mage in the tower to kill them all. Once the mage wars start, the towers in disputed areas will be pulled down instead of captured and armies will be formed as cover for mages on the move. The simplest way to defend a person being anonymity in the crowd. The towers in safer areas and large cities will remain, they are still the greatest statement of the power of a mage over the surrounding area. 

Since communication is by answerphone message there will be a little delay getting the ping but that's acceptable for the level of accuracy involved. There is a message on the system or not. Once there is a message on the system you know the appropriate time has passed, the time between your last check and your current check is your error margin. If it's less than a few minutes then that's as good as you need. The relative angles above the horizontal at noon gives latitude, the time to noon gives longitude. Neither group needs to know where they actually are, only where they are relative to the other group. The distances to travel are arc sections of the planet, not necessarily fixed known distances, but given the initial conditions, a sextant, and a time signal they can navigate one group to the other. A compass would help but is not required. The closer you are the less important the time signal becomes and the more important your accuracy with the sextant becomes. The trick is to be on the same latitude and know whether you should be moving East or West rather than needing to precisely place a location. Being found The stationary group will need to spend the intervening time making themselves as big a target as they can. They can do this by building upwards or outwards depending on the local geography. Reasonable outward building includes marking or cutting trees, leaving cairns or beacons on hilltops, carving arrows in rocks etc. Find landmarks, follow the river to the sea, climb the highest hills around, leave marks in mountain passes. Make your presence felt in the surrounding area. 

Option 1: The drought. This is the simplest and least intrusive option. The rains failed, the rains failed again, the land can no longer support so many people and they must go their own ways to survive. One of the great causes of exodus of populations over the centuries and liable to cause another great exodus in the coming generations, climate change, primarily droughts and famine, will uproot a population and send them out into the world. Option 2: The Babel option Make them hate each other, "curse" half the population, divide them against each other and and let them go their separate ways, as per the Tower of Babel. Option 3: The potato cannon So they really won't move, load them up and fire them off to the four corners of the earth, any god worthy of the name should be able to make sure they land safely. 

Lio has mentioned the extremes but the average person doesn't throw themselves out of a plane or climb Everest. There is a classification of risky activities that covers things "normal" people do. Assumed risk activities These are basic day to day activities to many people, simple common things with no great aura of danger around them. Whether for fun, riding horses, swimming, indoor climbing, sailing, skiing, kayaking. Work related, climbing ladders, trees, buildings, and using heavy machinery and power tools. Or just the daily commute, cycling, riding a motorbike. We call them assumed risk because they seem routine but any of them might kill you on any given day, they could easily leave you with serious injuries if you make a mistake. Yet we (those of us who do such things) don't consider them particularly risky when due precautions are taken, and occasionally have to be reminded that these activities are actually dangerous. Whether the reason is fun, convenience, efficiency or otherwise, humans take risks. Perhaps the risk and reward are required to be equivalent, but consider the risk of death on the road compared to the benefit of spending an hour less commuting, yet this is the game I play every day. 

This fortress was broken only by the Romans building an extra ramp up to the top of the mount and moving siege weaponry up said ramp. A fortress built in such a location can be as impenetrable as fortresses come. The problem being that, as General Tacticus said, 

No Through most of history it was easier to travel by sea than by land. This means that a large continent would be harder to cross and that much of the interior may be largely unaffected by diseases travelling rapidly round the coastal areas. Of course it could be that the interior either has a much lower population or be totally uninhabitable, but that is an entirely different question. 

Flooding, shortage of arable land, shallow soil on rocky ground. Regular flooding is nasty for burial, you really don't want coffins and corpses floating back up to the surface as the land is disturbed. Easily excavated land for burial is also usually your best land for farming. How much of that land can you afford to give up to the burial plot as your population expands? Perhaps the people are mostly hill farmers, keeping sheep and goats on rocky ground that basically can't be dug at all. The same is true if you have a high water table. With all these situations you have to start looking at other body disposal options, whether crypts, caves, mounds, cairns, or sky burial. 

You're going to trigger a cultural problem, that of the importance of being seen to do over actually doing. Let's consider two people 

A religion needs structure and ritual, it takes a few miracles to make his presence felt, but then he needs priests and missionaries, all of whom should receive good health and extended youth and life as a matter of course. It's important to keep the channel for blessings only through the religion and through its priests. A bit of liberal smiting will keep the church hierarchy in line as some level of corruption is inevitable. Support the hierarchy though, high priests should be chosen on seniority as living to a grand old age is one of the gifts of Bob, so the older the person the more blessed they are. If the eldest wasn't chosen by Bob, they wouldn't have lived long enough to achieve the position. Blessing and healing should not be given out for free outside the confines of the religion and its environs. This is important to prevent people demanding their right to a blessing and moaning when it's not given, rather than going through the ritual required to gain forgiveness and achieve purity first. Healing springs, springs of youth, etc. should only be within the confines of temples placed in awkward locations. Pilgrimage is important, the gift of Bob should not be easy to obtain. Offerings, donations, and prayer are also important. People seeking the gifts of Bob need to jump through hoops, it needs to be an event, a palaver. They need to spend a week in repentance and prayer, bathing in holy waters and fasting, and only then will the grace of Bob be given. Arbitrary rules should be put into place as a badge of membership of the religion. It's important that people have a badge that's visible to others to say who they are. Consider the various rules that some of the big religions have regarding clothes, headgear and haircuts as examples of this. Destroying the temples of a few major religions with fire from the skies in the middle of major festival services never goes amiss. Killing their priests but not the people in the event also wouldn't do any harm.
