In a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, $J$-holomorphic curves are special minimal surfaces if $J$ is compatible with the symplectic structure and the metric is induced by $\omega$ and $J$. Minimal surfaces satisfy the monotonicity property, i.e., if $S$ is a minimal surface passing through $p$, then for $r$ small enough, the area of $S \cap B_r(p)$ is at least $c r^2$, for some constant $c>0$ depending on the metric. This property can be used to prove, for example, the removal of singularity of $J$-holomorphic curves, and also, the diameter of a $J$-holomorphic curve cannot be arbitrarily large if the energy (area) is bounded. In Gromov-Witten theory, one also consider perturbations of the Cauchy-Riemann equation, as $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$, for other reasons. If just to prove removal of singularity, we can view the graph of a solution as a holomorphic curve in $\Sigma \times M$ (if domain is $\Sigma$), with respect to some almost complex structure on $\Sigma \times M$ depending on $\nu$. But my question is, if $\nu$ is sufficiently small (in $C^0$, for example), can we prove a monotonicity result for a solution $u$ to $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$ (but not its graph)? I suspect this holds because for $\nu$ small, a solution should be close to a real $J$-holomorphic curve. 

Suppose $X$ is a topological manifold and $Y \subset X$ is a locally flat submanifold. We know that $Y$ doesn't necessarily have a tubular neighborhood. My definition of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$ is a neighborhood $U$ with a map $\pi: U \to Y$ which is identity on $Y$ and $\pi: U \to Y$ is a disk bundle over $Y$. The locally flatness implies, however, every point $p\in Y$ has a neighborhood in $Y$ which has a tubular neighborhood. So "having a tubular neighborhood" is a property which cannot be simply glued from local to global. However, I wonder if the following is true. Suppose $Y$ has an open cover $\{Y_i\}$ and each $Y_i$ has a tubular neighborhood $\pi_i: U_i \to Y_i$. Suppose we require that $\pi_i$ agree on overlaps, i.e., $\pi_i(U_i \cap U_j) = \pi_j(U_i \cap U_j), \forall i,j$ Can this condition imply the existence of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$? Or, what should be the correct and natural condition to gurantee the gluing from local to global? 

Consider the Lagrange multiplier $$F(x, t, c) = f(x) + t( g(x) - c).$$ If $g$ satisfies your condition and $f$ is generic, then one can show that $$S:= \{ (x, t, c)\ |\ \nabla f(x) + t \nabla g(x) = 0,\ g(x) - c = 0 \}$$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. Its intersection with $c= a$ or $c= b$ are the critical point set of $f|_{g=a}$ and $f|_{g= b}$. This implies that (if $a$ and $b$ are generic), then the mod 2 counting of the two critical point sets are equal. In your counter-example, the $g = 0$ slice corresponds to a so-called "birth-death" which is not generic. 

Hilbert's tenth problem over the rationals is not known to be undecidable. However, even if it were, the equivalent rational statement would not follow, since one could grow the denominator to get "inaccessible" solutions rather than the absolute value. Nevertheless, I'm curious whether some kind of superpolynomial growth (e.g. exponential) is known to be achievable (or unachievable). So, for example, is there a system of equations of the form $$P(x_1,\ldots,x_n,\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_m)$$ such that for every rational $\vec\beta$ there is a rational $\vec x$ satisfying them, but the length of the smallest rational solution vector for a given fixed $\vec \beta$ is not bounded by a polynomial in the $|\beta_i|$? Or, conversely, is there some reason that this would be impossible? 

The undecidability of Hilbert's tenth problem implies the following (there is a stronger statement here, Theorem 9): 

I'm not sure if this should be a comment rather than an answer, since I'm not attempting to answer the hard questions (2) and (3). But it's too long to be a comment. That said: First of all, I just want to clarify that presumably you want incidence to be bounded with multiplicity, that is, the coefficients of the boundary map to also be bounded. For (4), take a look at this technical report by Attie and Block: $URL$ Theorem 4 is a de Rham theorem for $L^p$ cohomology -- for a manifold with bounded geometry, $L^p$ cohomology is equal to simplicial $L^p$ cohomology with real coefficients, on any given bounded triangulation. (I suppose you can also define a "piecewise de Rham" cohomology and then the isomorphism holds for any simplicial complex, in standard and $L^p$ flavors.) Now if you have a manifold with a nice enough CW structure, then you could replace each cell with a bounded number of simplices up to homotopy equivalence, and you would have an isomorphism from your theory to the "usual" de Rham version. The pullback to the universal cover of a CW structure on a compact manifold is of course nice enough, but a CW complex of bounded incidence is not. E.g. take an $\mathbb{R}$ and at the $n$th lattice point attach an $S^2$ which in turn has a 4-cell attached to it via a map with Hopf invariant $n$. This has bounded incidence, since only the 1-cells are incident to anything at all, but an infinite number of homotopy types of attaching maps and so a simplicial complex version would have to get more and more complicated as you go further out. I don't know of anyone studying the $L^2$ version in this level of generality. I studied the $L^\infty$ analogue at some length in my thesis (see sections 5 and 6 of $URL$ but I was only concerned with universal covers of compact spaces, which avoids a lot of technical issues. 

Given a space $X$ and an action of a group $G$ on $X$, the $G$-invariant cochains with coefficients in an Abelian group $A$ define a sub-cocomplex $\mathcal{C}^{\bullet}_G$ of the cocomplex $\mathcal{C}^{\bullet}$ of cochains with coefficients in $A$. I will call the cohomology $H^{\bullet}(\mathcal{C}_G)$ the "invariant cohomology" of $X$. What is the relationship between the follwing three objects: (i) the invariant cohomology, (ii) the usual equivariant cohomology $\mathcal{H}_G^{\bullet}(X, A)$, and (iii) the cohomology of the quotient space $H^{\bullet}(X/G,A)$? Note that I am most interested in the case where $A$ is a finite Abelian group. I think that there are always homomorphisms $$H^n(X/G,A) \to H^n(\mathcal{C}_G) \to \mathcal{H}_G^n(X,A).$$ The first map comes from pulling back the projection $X \to X/G$, and the second can be seen from the interpretation of equivariant cohomology as the total cohomology of the double cocomplex of group cochains of $G$ valued in $\mathcal{C}^{\bullet}$. But how does one characterize the kernel and image of these maps? Is there a simple statement if $X$ is contractible, say? [Edit: regarding the relationship between $H^n(X/G,A)$ and $H^n(\mathcal{C}_G)$, please see the comments on Mark Grant's answer. The upshot is that with simplicial cochains, $H^n(\mathcal{C}_G)$ seems to depend on the choice of triangulation. But, if one defines $\mathcal{C}_G$ in a suitably triangulation-independent way, i.e. either singular cochains, or simplicial cochains on the abstract simplicial complex containing all simplex embeddings into X, then $H^n(\mathcal{C}_G)$ and $H^n(X/G,A)$ are almost certainly not the same.] 

According to Atiyah, an $n$-dimensional TQFT is a functor from the bordism category of $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds into $\mathrm{Hilb}$. That is, for every $(n-1)$-dimensional manifold it assigns a vector space, and for every $n$-dimensional bordism a linear map. One can also generalize this to the notion of an extended TQFT where one also assigns values to lower-dimensional manifolds. However, here I am interested in the other direction, which I will call a "reverse-extended TQFT". That is, suppose we have an $(n+1)$-dimensional "bordism with corners" between $n$-dimensional bordisms. A reverse-extended TQFT should assign a value to such objects. We can treat $\mathrm{Hilb}$ as an 2-category where the only 2-morphisms are the identity morphisms. So from this point of view, a reverse-extended TQFT is equivalent to an ordinary TQFT for which the linear maps assigned to any two $n$-dimensional cobordisms which are themselves cobordant must be equal. So my questions are: is this a natural condition to impose on a TQFT? Is there a standard terminology for it? Does it follow from any other axioms? Related (I think): $URL$ 

Let $A$ be an Abelian group, and let $G$ be a finite group which acts on a finite set $M$, such that a subgroup $H$ acts trivially on $M$ and $G/H$ acts freely on $M$. I can define a $G$-module $A^M$ (i.e. Abelian group with $G$-action), with the $G$-action inherited from $M$. By restricting onto $H$ I get a homomorphism from $H^3(BG,A^M)$ to $H^3(BH, A)$. My intuition is that it should be an isomorphism because only the action of $H$ on $A^M$ is "sufficiently localized" to correspond to any non-trivial data. Is this correct?
