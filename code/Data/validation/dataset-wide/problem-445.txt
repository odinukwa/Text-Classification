There is scientific evidence of existence of pleasure centers in the brain. Stipulating some genetic modification able to stimulate them with some external signal (radiation, vibration, smell, whatever) is, more or less, trivial. It mostly would be reinforce certain mechanisms that are already present (and widely used in concerts, rave parties, advertisement, etc.). This would have the added benefit (for the government) to be able to control it (turn it off in case of mob uprising) and to localize it in "pleasure honeypots". Having it somewhat localized (in places where you cannot stay forever or in temporized bursts) can also alleviate the addiction problem (leading to hardening and requiring higher levels to get the same pleasure level) and avoid complete collapse of the society due to everybody being in a continuous stupor status. On the contrary it could be used as stimulus (reward) to have people work more. 

The only way such an arrangement could exist is having external planet being the heaviest and the others each in L1 point of next outer one. Unfortunately such an arrangement is not stable, so it would need corrections to keep alignment and avoid planets to drift out. This kind of correction would be quite small, if you do it before planet/spaceship drifts too far from its ideal position. Any (sufficiently strong) physical link between planets (as OP seems to indicate talking about "gravity link", which I interpret as a "space elevator" thing, but I could be very wrong) would contribute to stabilize the system (a really linked system would assume the required configuration in any orbit due to tidal forces, but required tensile stress rapidly becomes unmanageable, even in the SF context, as soon as planets are not in the proposed configuration). It is unclear how such a linked system may work without tidal locked planets. Note: Lagrangian points are computed on a 3-body system, your multi-body system would need some adjustment, but any alien race able to move planets shouldn't have problems working out details ;) 

The cited Hofstatter's book is a very interesting one and it is what spawned my interest on the subject, mut it is, IMHO, trying to hard to demonstrate a philosophical thesis ans thus it is, in the end, rather unconvincing. Note: I summarized my personal understanding of the matter in a small site I wish I had more time to maintain. You'll find many references to published academic papers there. 

If you really want to go to a distant galaxy you should first realize the nearest (Andromeda) is about 2.5 million light years. If You really want to travel that far (and get there before your ship falls apart) I think the best is "just" to exploit Lorentz time contraction. Have your spaceship to travel very near to light speed (say 0.99c) so that the crew would travel ~7.3 light-years in a single (subjective) year. Going even closer to light speed effect would be more relevant (at 0.999c in a single year spaceship would travel more than 22.6 light-years). At that speed you really need to start paying attention to the road ahead, so having an active crew (not in hibernation) may be actually useful. 

I'm not aware of any essay where slavery in a fantasy world is discussed, but discussions about real slavery in history (and current days) are aplenty. I would like to point out "slavery" actually covers practices very different and with very different moral/economic impact. Classic world (think "Romans") slavery was a direct result of conquers: along with other "prey", legions came back with a number of slaves; these were not "inferior beasts", but simply someone who had misfortune of losing a war. It was very common to have "manumission" which gave the slave back the freedom and, in certain cases even citizenship. Very similar was "debt slavery", where debtor became property of the owner of the debt for the time needed to cancel it (sometimes the whole life). Very different was "nigger" deportation; I knowingly used this "non politically correct" (and sometimes offensive) word to stress the fact slaves were considered as animals having little sentiment and no rights; this is vastly different from the above. In all cases there were efficient methods to enforce slavery; a runaway slave was treated just a bit worse than a deserter in a war. In classical times there have been several "servile wars" where all rioters were executed (often in a crude way). In most cases slavery was accepted as "a fact of life" even by the slaves who, for the great majority, were treated "humanly" (i.e.: were not much worse off than neighboring "free" guy); again, this seems different in (relatively) recent American (and not only) slavery. 

Rebuild a clone, if done down to molecular level (i.e.: brain structures replicated) you'll get even memories back. Postulate we are in a simulation and convince the simulators to load a previous "save game". 

A horsepower is larger than a manpower and costs (usually) less. For efficient uplifting of weight based on human power oversized critter-wheels are better suited and were actually used in practice (e.g.: in Mt. Saint Michael elevators). Having systems based on GravityLight-like systems makes sense if you need to generate relatively small power for a long time, so you lift a sand-bag some meters and then go doing your business while the bag comes back to ground. If You need a lot of energy you would connect an array of critter wheels (or other devices like spiked hubs) directly to the generator. 

Another question may be relevant for yours. Apparently your colony is too small (by several orders of magnitude) to sustain modern technology. It is said there bare minimum to sustain technology against specialization seems to be over 10M, probably nearer to 50M. Many of the reasons explained there IMHO hold true, but I would add a few caveats: 

We are social animals and associations work much better if we share knowledge and abilities. Any sane firm/society has programs for "continued education" of its members; otherwise their usefulness would decline with time. A certain number of (IMHO insane; reasons for this are outside the scope of this Answer) firms actually rely on turnover to get the skill they need. This is true for any association; I might be a skilled programmer, but: 

First of all: hollow bird bones are not weaker than "normal" ones, quite the contrary; no reason to stay away from them. Falcons and condors have the kind of wings you need: relatively short but powerful, with several "improvements" (e.g.: separated primary feathers on wing tips) needed to make them almost as efficient in gliding as big seabirds (which have much more elongated wings). Wing disposition could be interleaved in an elongated "Chinese dragon" style body (head, forward wings, forward legs, middle wings, hind legs, hind wings, tail) which will allow for free movement with minimal interference. A relatively nimble back would allow to use body torsion to improve maneuverability (forward and hind wings might be on quite distinct planes even while soaring). The three wing-pairs would normally flap in wave to mitigate turbulence (hind wings would always be in turbulent air of forward ones); most likely the hind wings would be used for forward propulsion (i.e.: they would be flapping) while forward and middle would provide uplift. Body needs quite a strong sternum keel to support flight muscles; this means legs should be rather long and in ventral position to allow easy grasping of prey. Talons are appropriate, but also a cat-like paw (with retractable nails) may be a good choice.
