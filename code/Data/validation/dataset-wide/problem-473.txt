It depends on the unit. Cadence is good to have, if you want to do any sort of training, but cadence is often poorly implemented. In fact, I'm not aware of ANY good computers with cadence at present. The old Cateye Micro was excellent, but it's not been available for 15 years or so. If you get a unit with cadence you want to be sure it has a SEPARATE cadence pickup, not a combined pickup for both cadence and rear wheel speed. (The current Cateyes use a combined pickup that is impossible to keep aligned.) As to "extra hassle", the cadence pickup, being near the crank and the foot, is slightly more apt to be knocked out of alignment than the speed pickup, but it's really not that much of a "hassle" (so long as it's not combined with the speed pickup). The main reason for not having a cadence unit is that there aren't many good ones (if any at all). (I was making use of cadence on my bike trip last week, to help me keep my RPMs up when I got tired. It was a definite asset in that case.) 

I loosely tighten before inflation- just to stop the valve from disappearing whilst inflating it. After inflation, it needs to be finger tight- else it will rattle on the rim. This is probably the number one reason why most people don't use them- the slightest looseness here will be very noisy (especially to deeper section wheels). 

So I took the old bottom bracket out of my hybrid frame, FSA Platinum ISIS Bottom Bracket 68 x 118mm. I then replaced with a Shimano BBUN55 Square Taper 68 x 11.8cm. Then realised that this was a square taper, not the star shaped of the previous FSA. Now obviously my crankset won't fit. Happy to purchase another crankset, as mine has 6,000km+ of hard way & I really don't fancy taking it back out again. Would something like: $URL$ fit? Otherwise, should I take it out and order the correct one? The only BB I can see if the same one, and they only seem to last 3,000km :( 

Yeah, I would suggest that you not start out doing this daily, but do it every 2nd or 3rd day for a couple of weeks, taking care to take an extra rest day when needed. You will find that some days you are eager to get started riding and others your stomach churns at the thought, and you can kind of use that to adjust your frequency. After about 2 weeks, if you're tolerating it well, you can increase frequency, but probably not more than 2 days on/1 day off for another month. You'll likely be sore the next day for the first few days of riding, but the soreness should abate. If it doesn't then don't increase frequency, and maybe ease off a little. It is possible to cause serious muscle injury if you overdo in this sort of situation, especially if you're genetically predisposed. (It wouldn't be quite so much a concern if the route were flat, but a 5-degree (9%) grade is pretty steep, and you'll be getting a pretty good workout even if only half the route is that sttep.) 

When you take the tire off to fix the puncture- find where the hole(s) are. If there are 2 holes approx the rim width apart, then you have a pinch flat. If it is just one hole, then its probably glass/thorn etc. You will get punctures from glass/thorn no matter what pressure you run at. Once you have checked, if it's a double hole- run your pressures higher, suggest you look at your tyre and run just below the max (eg. if max is 100psi, run at 90). If you run them at the max pressure, it can feel very "hard" on the road (but is used for maximum efficiency) If it's a single hole- then looking at tyres with Kevlar/other puncture protection would be a good idea (especially if it continues to happen). 

Yeah, it's an old bike -- before "indexed shifters", making it at least 20 years old, I suspect. (The reflectors suggest to me that it's probably not over about 30 years old, though.) Apparently, from the sound of things, it's working fairly well, though, and should be reasonably safe if a few details are given attention. First off, the tires and tubes, if 20-30 years old, are probably rotten and apt to blow out without warning. I'd advise replacing them (if you keep the bike). At the very least check the tire sidewalls and the tube stem (bend it side to side a bit and look near the base) for cracks. The brakes should be checked. Mainly it's a question of "do they work?" (ie, stop the bike reasonably well with moderate hand pressure), as the rubber pads may have become too hard to be effective, requiring that the pads be replaced. (Absolutely nothing wrong with cantilevered brakes, BTW. It's "old" technology, yes, but still used on some new bikes, and quite reliable and easy to maintain.) Lightly lubing the chain (buy a small bottle of "dry" chain oil at a bike shop) and the derailers would be advised. If the rear derailer is gummed up it should be cleaned, but if the bike is really so lightly used that's probably not a problem. Otherwise, there's not a lot that can go seriously wrong -- not sufficient to be a safety hazard, at least. However, a brief checkup at a local bike shop might be worthwhile, or at least a look-see from a biker buddy. The "grinding" sound is "normal" (for a non-indexed system) and "fixing" is is basically a matter of learning how to adjust the shifters "just right". It's complicated by the fact that you have two shifters and two derailers, and both derailers can make noise. So until you learn the ropes half the time you'll be adjusting the wrong shifter. (But it's not really that hard to do this -- just takes a little practice.) Even if you decide to get a new bike, I'd advise using this one a bit first, to become familiar with handling a bike and to get a better feel for what "fits" you and what doesn't. 

I use many of the same techniques that @M.Werner recommends. Get a general fit and then tweak as needed. Generally I will take a guess at where things should be and then climb on. It is usually obvious when I'm way wrong. For a little fine tuning I will balance with a counter top or the like and then pedal backwards for a bit, obviously doesn't work with FG, hopping off and making tweaks. The final tweaks I make come from riding around noting changes to make and then when I take a break or am ready to turn around I make adjustments. I find I get a better idea for how well honed my setup is by actually riding than by measurements. 

Any replacement would need to be matched to the dynamo in voltage and load. I'd suggest that you contact the dynamo manufacturer to find out what might work. 

A derailleur-style chain needs to be more flexible, side-to-side. Not that such flexibility will cause problems on a single-speed setup. Also, newer derailleur setups need for the chain pins to project slightly, to facilitate indexed shifting. This is not needed (but harmless) in a single-speed setup. 

As to the question of whether runners "have a right" to use the bike lane, that would depend on your local laws. My guess would be "yes", unless there's some specific exclusion -- the bike lane would likely fall into the same classification as other bike paths -- where pedestrians are allowed in most jurisdictions. As to whether they "should", keep in mind that many runners feel (perhaps with some justification) that running on concrete is harder on the legs than running on asphalt. 

You need to replace tires when they are worn out. Depending on the type of tyre, there are a number of signs to look for: 

Lots of the answers above look quite large/expensive (apart from the hooks), try taking a look at CLUGs. $URL$ They are very cheap, very small, and can easily be removed etc. 

I'd say SPDs, both the pedals I have used (the cheapest Shimano M520) and the shoes cleet seem to last forever. I literally only replaced my pedals when the damp in my garage caused them to rust after nearly 2 years & 8,500km of wear. Walking in them isn't too bad- as they are designed to be used for mountain biking (and running/walking up hills)- though this will depend on the shoes you buy. A friend has some shoes that look like trainers- and the cleet is so recessed you can't tell its a cycling shoe. Shimano M520's are double sided, so never going to miss clipping in, and their "hold/float" is adjustable etc. 

The tool to check for "chain stretch" is incredibly cheap -- something every halfway-serious cyclist should have. And chain breakage is most often caused by poorly executed shifting under load or a poorly adjusted derailer. (Though another cause is a poorly joined chain.) (Poor lubrication is unlikely to cause the chain to break as a first indication -- excessive wear of chain and cogs is far more likely, and the chain will only break when wear has reached extreme levels.) 

The rings should be oriented to extract the maximum energy from the most powerful part of the stroke (from roughly 3-oclock to 6-oclock, viewed from the right). The rings should be oriented to maintain a (relatively) constant forward force/velocity, despite the change in leg force through the rotation. The rings should be oriented to maintain "smooth" leg motion. (Whatever that means.) 

I use compression clothing because they are usually better at wicking away sweat and keeping me dry and cool (remember cotton kills). I also like that because they are tight fitting I don't have to worry about them getting caught in my bike, I have had shorts catch on different parts of my frame before. Another plus is that I think I look pretty good in compression clothing. Bike shorts with a bit of pad are awesome! But as far as fatigue I don't have any information. I think the prevailing theory is that compressed muscles will be less fatigued, but I have my doubts with that theory. 

Cycle Routes UK (different site similar name): Gives route information filtered by area, distance, path type, and difficulty. Again, it is not point to point, but if you are looking for good routes to exercise or time trial against it seems like a good source. You can even add routes that you know about that aren't in the system and help others. If you are looking for predefined and tested routes this would work nicely. $URL$ 

I always carry the cutoff from a new chain (or a few links of it) in my kit. Take the chain apart at the next link down from where you lost the pin (being more careful this time) and then take two half-links from the cutoff and install them. And, while you have that cutoff piece handy, do a trial to see how many turns of the crank it it is to take the pin almost all the way out, write down than number, and store it with the tool. Or just use quick links. 

Working on rehabbing donated bikes for Christmas Anonymous, I regularly encounter bikes where the rim brake pads have hardened to the point that the brakes are ineffective. We have a stock of salvaged pads that we've generally drawn from as replacements, but that stock is getting pretty thin. So I took a pad from a bike (a BSO with relatively conventional cantilever brakes, which is the most common config we see) and visited a local bike shop. Here they sold me a couple of pairs of Shimano BR-CT91 pads. These were a pretty close match in terms of appearance -- the actual pad is a hair shorter, and the mounting shaft lacks the ribbing of the old unit, but otherwise pretty close. But when I went to install the pads they wouldn't go in. The mounting shaft of the new pad was ever so slightly larger in diameter than the old one, so it simply wouldn't fit. I'm suspecting that the Shimano pads are intended for V-brakes, not cantis. So, the question is: What different configurations of brake pads are there, and how do you tell them apart? And is there any terminology (other than obscure manufacturer's part numbers) that will distinguish one type from another? (This is particularly important if we want to order some replacement pads online.)
