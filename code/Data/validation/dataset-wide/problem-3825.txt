It is consistent that $2^{\aleph_0} > \aleph_\omega$. This is immediate from Cohen's work; force with all finite partial functions from $\aleph_{\omega}$ to $2$. More generally Easton has shown that the only constraints on exponentiation of regular cardinals is that it be monotonic and satisfy $\mathrm{cof}(2^\kappa) > \kappa$. For singular cardinals, the matter is much more subtle. For instance one of Shelah's celebrated results is that if $\aleph_\omega$ is a strong limit cardinal, then $2^{\aleph_\omega} < \aleph_{\omega_4}$ (and no, that $4$ is not a misprint). 

More can be said than non-first-order axiomatizability. Since the free group $ \mathbb{Z}^{(\omega)}$ is an $L_{\infty, \omega}$-elementary substructure of the non-$\aleph_{2}$-free group $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$, there is no axiomatization of the class of free groups (or of $\aleph_{2}$-free groups) in $L_{\infty, \omega}$. If large cardinals exist, the outcome is very different. Mekler proved that if there is a strongly compact cardinal $\kappa$, then the class of free abelian groups is definable in $L_{\infty, \infty}$ (and in $L_{\kappa, \kappa}$ in fact). Furthermore, if the class of free abelian groups is definable in $L_{\infty, \infty}$, then there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal. 

I've been in contact with Patrick Dehornoy and Ales Drapal and both thought that $A_{28}$ is likely the current record for a Laver table computation. 

Suppose that $(S,*)$ is a finite set equipped with a binary operation. Extend the binary operation to the vector space $V$ with basis $S$. The set of probability measures on $S$, viewed as a compact convex subset of $V$ is closed under $*$ and, since $*$ is continuous, there are idempotent measures on $S$. Must two idempotent measures on $S$ have distinct supports? I am also interested in the more general question where the assumption of finiteness is dropped and one considers the extension (by convolution) of $*$ to the family of all finitely additive measures on $S$ (in that context, define the support of a measure to be all subsets of $S$ with positive measure). 

Suppose $\Lambda$ is a Lagrangian submainfold of $M=T^*\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $x_i$ be the standard coordinate on the base manifold $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\eta_j$ the coordinate on the dual. According to a lemma of Arnol'd, for any given point $p$ on $\Lambda$, there is a neighborhood $U_p$ of it that projects diffeomorphically onto an open set of one of the Lagrangian planes $\{x^{(1)}=0,\eta^{(2)}=0\}$ where $x^{(1)}$ and $\eta^{(2)}$ are subsets of $\{x_i\}$ and $\{\eta_j\}$. The pre-canonical Maslov operator on $U_p$ is the operator $K$ that maps $\varphi\in C_0^\infty(U_p)$ to a function on $\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^+$ $$K_{U_p}\varphi= u(x,\hbar)=(-\frac{\hbar}{2\pi i})^k\int J(x^{(2)},\eta^{(1)})\exp[i\hbar (S(x^{(2)},\eta^{(1)})+x^{(2)}\cdot \eta^{(2)})]\varphi(r(x^{(2)},\eta^{(1)}))d\eta^{(1)} $$ where $k$ is the number of elements in $\eta^{(1)}$, $J$ is a Jacobian factor, $S$ is the generating function, and $r$ is the inverse of the projection of $U_p$ to $\{x^{(1)}=0,\eta^{(2)}=0\}$. The idea of the operator is of course to take a partial Fourier transform. However, the functions in question $S$, $J$ and $\varphi$ are only defined on $U_p$, and pulls back to a function defined only on an open subset of $\eta^{(1)}$. How can we take the partial Fourier transform of such functions? 

Let $\gamma_\infty$ denote the product Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$. Which $a,b \geq 0$ satisfy that for every Borel set $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ of positive measure, $a K + b y$ has positive measure for $\gamma_\infty$-a.e. $y$? The knee-jerk answer is ``only $a = 1$, $b=0$.'' The Cameron-Martin Theorem tells us that $x \mapsto x + y$ is absolutely continuous exactly when $y$ is in $\ell^2$ (a set of $\gamma_\infty$-measure $0$). Similar arguments apply to linear transformations like those above. This does not answer the question, however. In fact Solecki and I have recently proved that if $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ is Borel and of positive measure, then $\gamma_\infty(\sqrt{1+b^2} K + b K) > 0$ for $\gamma_\infty$-a.e. $y$ (i.e. a sufficient conditions is that $a^2 = b^2 +1$). See $URL$ for the preprint. It is not difficult to prove that a necessary requirement for a positive answer is that $a^2 + b^2 -2ab \leq 1 \leq a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$. This leaves some discrepancy, however, and that is the question at hand. 

The following theorem of Kurepa, proved in his thesis of 1935, seems to address your question. Theorem Suppose that $\kappa = cf(\kappa) > \gamma$, and $(T, <_{T})$ is a $\kappa$-tree each of whose levels has cardinality less than $\gamma$. Then $(T, <_{T})$ has a cofinal branch. The proof uses the Pressing Down Lemma (Fodor's theorem) and the Pigeonhole Principle with the bound $\gamma$ to find the branch. A good reference on the general area is A. Kanamori, The Higher Infinite, which contains the proof of the above theorem. You might also wish to consult J. Cummings, M. Foreman, The tree property, Advances in Mathematics, 131, 1998, 1-32. 

I think one could make the case that idempotent ultrafilters are so closely related to Ramsey theory that anything which uses them does relate to Ramsey theory in some way (almost by definition). A less obvious example though would be Gowers's result that $c_0$ is oscillation stable --- that every bounded Lipschitz function on the sphere of $c_0$ is $\epsilon$-constant when restricted to an infinite dimensional subspace. That utilizes a system of idempotent ultrafilters on a families of (partial) semigroups known as $\mathrm{FIN}_k$ (where $k$ ranges over the natural numbers). 

Let a compact Lie group $G$ acts on a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. If the action is Hamiltonian with $\mu$ the moment map, then the integral $$\int_M e^{i\mu (X)+\omega}$$ is equal to the first term in the stationary phase approximation. My question is if there is a similar integral formula for a compact $M$ with boundary. 

Suppose $$f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k\frac{(i x)^k}{k!}$$ where $$a_k=k!\int_0^1 p_k(y_{k-1})\int_0^{y_{k-1}}p_{k-1}(y_{k-2})\cdots \int_0^{y_1}p_1(y_0) dy_0\cdots dy_{k-2}\;dy_{k-1}$$ for functions $p_i>0$ and $p_i=p_j$ if $i=j \mod 2$. Is $f$ is bounded on $\mathbb{R}$? This is a generalization of situation when $p_1=p_2=p$. In this case, $$f(x)=\exp\left(ix \int_0^1 p(y)dy\right),$$ and we know that $f(x)$ is bounded. More generally, is there any assumptions that we can put on $a_k$ to make sure $f(x)$ is bounded? Any reference is appreciated. 

The answer is negative apparently. It is consistent relative to ZFC that all Aronszajn trees are special and that the club principle holds: $URL$ 

TFAE: (i) $\kappa$ is weakly compact; (ii) $\kappa$ has the tree property; (iii) $\kappa \rightarrow (\kappa)^{2}_{2}$. TFAE: (i) $\kappa$ is strongly compact; (ii) $\kappa$ has the strong tree property. TFAE: (i) $\kappa$ is supercompact; (ii) $\kappa$ has the super tree property. 

W.W. Comfort, S. Negrepontis, The Theory of Ultrafilters, section 13, in particular Theorem 13.7 and Corollary 13.8, might be useful to you. It contains a textbook presentation of the relevant proofs (without games). 

Suppose $f$ is a Schwartz function on $\mathbb{R}$. Is there a closed formula for $$\sum_0^\infty \hat{f}(n)$$ where $\hat{f}$ is the $n$-th Fourier coefficient of $f$? 

Suppose $f_\lambda(x),\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous/smooth family of bounded function on $\mathbb{R}$. Given a measurable set $\mathfrak{m}$ on $\mathbb{R}$, define $$E_\mathfrak{m}:L^2\longrightarrow C(\mathbb{R})$$ by $$E_\mathfrak{m}(\varphi):=\int_\mathfrak{m}f_\lambda\langle f_\lambda,\varphi\rangle d\;\lambda.$$ Is there any condition we can put on $f_\lambda$ so that $E$ become a resolution of the identity? Is it the case that so long as $f_\lambda(x)=\exp(i \lambda x)$ when $|x|>>0$, and $f_\lambda$ is separating family, then we always get a resolution of the identity?
