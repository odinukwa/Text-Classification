If you are only going to use them to cross rivers and you are wanting to save on weight / space, I would suggest some neoprene booties. Surf or diving booties will do just fine. Some are like a neoprene sock, you will get a hole in these fairly quickly. Some are more substantial and are like a neoprene sock with a rubber sole. I would suggest you get a pair of these. They weigh very little and will easily survive walking over slippery wet rocks. You can also pick them up for well under Â£20 from any surf shop or online retailer. Try somewhere like decathlon or go outdoors or just do a goole search for surf booties. There are plently of online retailers selling them. 

Me and my partner will be spending a week in February in the Lake District, UK (Monday to Friday). We want to get as much walking in as possible and attempt a number of the peaks / ridges. We are very aware that we will find heavy snow and cold temperatures and that crampons / ice axes are recommended for that time of year. Neither of us have experience of using crampons and ice axes. We've had a look at the local centers who offer courses, and they all offer 2 day courses where they show you how to use the equipment and how to stay safe. However all the courses run at weekends. Does anybody know of a mid-week course? Or alternatively, does anybody know of a good guide we could hire for a few days to guide us on some of the hikes and show us the techniques along the way? 

I don't understand why you're so centric around protein. There are protein bars, some of which contain over 20g of protein. There are also freeze dried meats which is actually more protein dense(higher protien-weight ratio) than protein bars. Freeze dried foods generally offer the best weight to calorie ratio, because they have almost no water weight. Even a dry nut or beef jerky will still retain water weight. Freeze drying would likely be the best route when trying to find high protein meals for the very same reason. If you can't find enough protein in these meals, and can't carry something like jerky, peanut butter, nuts, etc because of weight. You should probably supplement protein with whey powder or something similar, which is literally straight protein, and about double the amount of protein density as a standard protein bar. Spirulina is a bit higher than protein bars in protein density. Thru-hikers usually don't even supplement protein like this, and get it from eating a standard healthy diet. I can't imagine why you'd need so much protein, unless your traveling a very long distance without possibility of resupply. Even people who do long distance hiking without resupply focus on calorie density, and tend to carry up to(possibly more) 30lbs of food. You might just have to accept the fact that you're going to consume less than optimal amounts of protein for muscle recovery and just power threw the aches for the duration of your trip. But to answer your question, the 3 highest protein density foods: 

It is best to throw them a line or float. Use a long stick. They will grab you & take you under with them. Normal way is to sail close with your outrigger & let them grab one. Then set of a flare. To bring other boats. Near shore yell loud bring out the people form a human chain. This is much safer than trying alone. The human chain has saved many lives near shore were I live in storms when boats are drove into the rocks making shore. S. Pacific. 

Misamis Oriental. Philippines. Running out to the Spartly islands. Varied rock formations & depth of water. Different currents at sea. But you need travel to see the different ones. Each area differs. Not many tour dives. 

You do not say were you sail. Bamboo jungle stile. A number of 5 gal. buckets. Fill 1/2 with sea water. A 4 to 6 inch PVC pipe in the center to catch water. Paint black. A plastic clear top of sheet plastic. Put weight in center so water runs down & drops into pvc pipe. Small rabbit pump to remove water. Home made. You should get 1 quart of water per day per bucket. In the tropics average. 1 quart of water is enough for a sponge bath. or to do the dish's & such. Also catch rain of your sail. Cloths put in a net bag with rope & trow over the side. Seawater cleans cloths very well. If rain hang them out on the lines to rinse. Sail with the trade winds. Rainy season then. 

Some parks require you to have a bear canister. Here in the Rocky Mountains if you camp up in the mountains(no trees to sling a bag) you're usually required to have a canister, not because of bears but marmots. Bear canisters might be a little much, but its a sure fire way to prevent animals from getting in your food.Once I bought one, I've always used it even when I could bring a food bag, simply because I have it. It's quite a bit heavier and a bit bulky. But it comes in handy if you end up camping far from a treeline. 

Earlier last month I witnessed someone fell a tree in the Eagles Nest Wilderness while I was on a backpack trip. Its quite obvious that you're not supposed to cut down trees in a national forest, in this particular wilderness fires are also prohibited. I hadn't any idea how to deal with this group of individuals. I feel that yelling at them would have done no good, as its obvious that what they were doing was wrong and they knew it. Should I have reported these individuals? I had no way to identify them, and its hard to track who was even in the area during that time frame. Should I have said something? Threatened to report them? Or is it best to just let it happen, because it seems there's not much that can be done. It really upsets me to see someone do something so detrimental to a protected area. Its such an obvious trace of human presence. I've heard this has become a big problem in the Maroon-Bells Snowmass Wilderness, which isn't far from where I was hiking. 

Masshurumu Button Point to button on your shirt. Fairly expensive in Japan. That type fresh. Grown commercial there. Or wild. Close as I can come. 

When you go to your cobbler. He will draw a pattern of both your feet to fit the sole & shoe. Next he will show you the different soles he can work with. & inner soles he can use. Next you select the leather you wish. If a cloth liner in them you select that. Any thing added to the boot needs talked about then. He will show you what he can do & what leather he will use for it. It takes a week to make a pair of good boots. If he can start on them that day. Your price seams High. $200 U.S. at most for good custom boots. I pay $30 to $35 for good shoes from my cobbler. There big advantage is. They can be resoled at his shop for long use. If damaged returned for repair to his shop. Wife buys some as she wants a little different shoe that the latest at the Mall. Show of. At near the same cost as the mall in latest stile. In good shoes. 

I have drank it. These were the big vines that grew to the top of trees. Just cut them & let the water flow into a collector below. Wild grapes here not domestic. I had no ill effects from this. This was in a swamp area that was under water 3 to 4 months a year. So safer than other water avalable at that time. 

I would suggest walking with flat feet rather than the usual rolling foot technique most people walk with. This means that rather than landing with your heel 1st and rolling onto the ball of your foot, you should walk in such a way that your whole foot contacts the ground at the same time. This should keep you upright on flat ground. You will also notice that walking this way you will start to use your hamstrings and glutes to walk rather than your calves. If you're walking uphill, I would suggest step kicking, like that used by mountaineers walking uphill in snow or ice. From your description I get the impression that the ground has thick mud rather than a thin layer of mud / moss over slippery rocks. To walk with step kicks, on every step you should kick the ground with the toecap on your boots. This will push your foot through the soft mud and essentially create a small flat 'step' which you can then use to walk on rather than walking on an incline. Walking poles might also help you with stability as you can drive these into the ground and use these to take some of your weight, so you put less weight through your feet. Amalgamating the alast 3 paragraphs from the answer from @JamesJenkins into this as per the request of the OP. 

Not keeping a eye on the tides. Near shore or between islands the tide going out can sweep you out to sea. Once back on the beach it can be a long walk back to your flipflops On hot sand rocks coral & such. Just because you fail to see the shark does not mean he his not there. Other beach goers do not pay attention to you way out there. It is a long swim back from out there with fish & speargun. I would advise if going out that far to take a inflatable object with you. 

For me. Chicken necks tied on a string. Crabs will hold onto them till pulled very close to shore were you dip net them with a flat or strait nose dipnet. Also in box traps the pull up kind if in a boat. Were the sides lay out flat. Or form a pyramid. S Pacific. 

They do make a balloon tire a wide one for bikes just for beach riding. That is the way to go on the beach. Takes a wide rim. See often in the Philippines & bikes made for beach & sand ridding. Gear low sand has a lot of drag even with beach or sand tires. 

Cow will run towards you if they think you have feed or milking time. Stand your ground facing them. They will stop about 3 foot from you. A bull charges in a strait line. Head down. You can side step them & work your way to a fence or tree. A cow charges head up. They keep sight of you. If they don't hook you slide your bullock knife between there ribs. Get a lung on them. P.S. Last waterbuffalo charge I seen 3 years ago. It took 3 men to bring her down & 1 still got hurt. 

I've gotten pretty sufficient fires on a rainy fall day with relatively wet wood. Something that I often do is collect a lot of wet wood use the fire to dry out other logs. Make sure they're relatively small so they dry out by the time you need them. Just keep putting wood around the fire to dry as you use it. A good recommendation from @whatsisname is you use charcoal. You can even make your own out of what ever type of wood you'd prefer. ADDITION: If you cannot dry the wood. You can try cooking the wood down into coals, and cooking with a dutch over, or cooking directly on the coals. You can wrap potatoes and vegetables and throw them on the coals, you can use a cast iron pan and set it on top the coals, or you can set the coals on a dutch oven to cook via indirect heat. Searing with a pan on top of coals is probably the best alternative to grilling over the fire with something like a tripod. This will also significantly decrease the amount of smoke that contacts your food. 

Really its all about the loft. So if you have a specific bag you're wondering about, next time you launder it look at it when its wet and see how much loft remains. I know my winter bag loses about 40% of its loft when wet, which isn't bad, especially because it dries quickly even if it relatively humid. There are many different types of synthetic insulation, different types of face fabrics that can affect the loft. There are too many variables to give a flat number. I've heard people say that synthetic base layers are 40% effective when totally wet, but I don't know how that carries over. Really the best thing to do is take your dry sleeping bag, and fluff it out until its fully lofted. Take a ruler and measure 3 points on the sleeping bag to see how much loft you have and average them. Launder the bag, and measure the same 3 points while the bag is wet and average them. Take the averages and you can calculate the percentage difference.
