im not sure if the cables might be to thin for you to notice, but the easiest way todifferentiate between stainless steel and galvanized is to look and see what the metal looks like. 

The main function of a serial number is to prove that you own the bike. Just like a VIN number on a car, your serial number helps authorities determine who the lost or stolen bike belongs too. Also, it does help the store you purchased the bike from, as well as the company that made the bike, in keeping track of warranties, who owns the bike, the address where the bike belongs, e.t.c. Think of your serial number the same way as you think of registering your car. As a side note, using the serial number for finding out information about the bike such as make, model, year, e.t.c., may work sometimes, but it is not genuinely a reliable way to find out that information. 

Instead of an actual GPS device, I would recommend buying a used smart phone, (The Strava app itself only works on either iPhones or Androids). A "Nothing Special" used smart phone you can usually find for maybe 40 bucks, depending on the model and brand. Download the app and just take the phone with you wherever you ride. It's not a fancy system, but it works. This is the method I use now. 

I would say that most people on Craigslist would be willing to let you give it a test ride, I mean it's similar to buying a car. Just, as I always tell people, meet with the person in a very public space. Much safer place. As for what to look for, I would do a little research into exactly what you are expecting to use the bike for. Figure out the kind of bike you need and do a little research on the kind of mech recommended for what you're doing,(frame, gears, wheels, shifters, brakes, drive train.) Once you figure all that out, you can narrow down your selection on Craigslist. Just like looking at different models in the store, online you will find pictures, descriptions, e.t.c. So you can find the right bike for you. Once you think you've found one, speak with the seller and find out more about the bike. Research things like the bikes brand, how old it is, e.t.c. Once everything checks out, boom. You have your bike! 

I ride now with pretty decent comfort, I have no real back/neck/shoulder pain. As I ride now I feel decent, but I feel as though I might be in too much of an upright position on the bike to get the best performance. 

You probably would be alright. But just take into account that the 50 pound carrying limit is for your rack and what it can carry, not the four screws that attached the rack to your bike and what they can carry. In essence, it would be like taking a 4000 pound winch, securing it to a high position, and lifting an f250 into the air with it. The winch itself would probably be ok, but the mounting area where you attached it to the vehicle would probably fail. I would suggest being very careful if you choose to carry your bike by the rack. Personally, I would find a grip on the actual frame itself. Hope this helped! 

I'd assume it's something you could, but you probably shouldn't do. Kind of like shifting a car into gear without being stopped, you're just gunna wear your hardware that much faster. 

This is the kind of thing that can go one of two ways. Either it will work, or it won't. The material for the seat does not always determine if it will be comfortable. I've seen a triple cushioned seat that would break your tailbone if you rode more than five miles on it; I've also seen a seat made of thick, hard resin-like material that felt like a pillow. Rather than the material of the seat, it all boils down to how the seat molds to your backside. If it is the right shape and the in the right position, you could have a section of 2x4 as a seat and it would probably be more comfortable than a cushioned seat that isn't the right shape/position. Sorry to get a little off topic with that one. Anyways,as the first answer stated, I would be concerned about the integrity of the wood on the seat. Is the glue weather proof? Will the sealant fail due to the moisture from your rear? Will the wood flex? What if you chip the seat, will you get slivers? I would suggest doing more research on the saddle, and most of all, see if you can find any product reviews. Good luck! 

I would suggest any site like Amazon, EBay, or craigslist even. I just skimmed through and Amazon, as well as EBay have a good assortment of seat posts in that size. If you want an actual bike shop website, try using Wiggle. It is something of a surplus store, so they have a pretty decent selection at decent prices. Your seat post size seems to be fairly common, so I don't think you should have any problems finding something that works for you. 

As you said, the first issue with routing the cables that way would probably be the amount of friction placed on the cable due to the angles of the routing. Another possibility is that if you were to route the cables that way, they might become too short and could inhibit the turning capacity of the handlebars. 

I would recommend, as you stated you were already doing, that you give your driving mech a full cleaning. Run some hot water and a degreaser through all of your gears and your chain, (thoroughly). After that, (it helps if you have a repair stand for this), take some nice chain oil and run it on your chain real good, then shift through all of your gears and run that lube thoroughly through your gears. Personally, I do this two or three times to make sure everything is well lubed. Don't use too much, but dont be stingy with it either. Also, be sure you lube both sides of the chain. I'm sure the mech itself is ok, but maybe it would be good to check and make sure your front and rear d√©railleur are clean so that your shifting is smooth. Also check to make sure your gears are indexed correctly. Hopefully something here helps you out. Good luck! 

To be honest, you're really asking this question too late. If you had asked before your tour, I believe the easiest way you could have measured it would be to find a cycling app which takes your weight and your other physical information. Then you simply weigh your fully loaded bike and add that weight to your own, then the app would measure your total calories burned. (Even this would only be a rough estimate). However, there is no solid answer to this question. As I said before, you would have been better off asking this prior to the trip, as there are dozens upon dozens of factors needed to give you an accurate BALLPARK of how many calories you've burned. (I.e. Speed, terrain, average gradient, food consumed while on your trip, average power output, length of time spent in the saddle, cadence, over all distance, e.t.c.) I suppose if you wanted a very rough estimate, find a calorie calculator online, input the total weight, (you and the loaded bike), take the distance traveled, and the estimated total time in the saddle. This method would be fairly inaccurate, but without the factors listed above, I believe it's the closest you would get.
