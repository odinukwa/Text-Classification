All well-ordered sets can be compared. They have the same number if they, by preserving their order, can be uniquely mapped or counted onto each other. 

There are mathematicians who accept only those entities as numbers which can be expressed without any uncertainty by finite digit sequences in some basis, i.e., rational numbers. That position is not irrational but contrary to common use. In order to answer the question, first we have to determine what existence means. There are two alternatives with respect to numbers: E1) A number exists if it can be individualized in mathematical discourse such that its numerical value can be calculated in principle by every mathematician without any error. E2) A number exists if it can be individualized in mathematical discourse such that its numerical value can be calculated in principle by every mathematician with error less than any given eps > 0. If you agree to E2, then sqrt2 exists. If you accept the following grades of definition, then the sqrt2 is a well-defined number by D3. But people who require D2, don't accept sqrt2 as a number. These people opine that "number" is a patent of nobility that cannot be issued to values that cannot be represented by decimal systems. Of course however they accept that irrationals are existing as important mathematical objects. D1) Some real numbers are extremely well defined: The small natural numbers like 3 or 5 can be grasped at first glance, even in unary representation. D2) A real number is very well defined, if its value (compared with the unit) can be determined without any error, like all rational numbers the representations of which have complexity that can be handled by humans or computers. D3) A real number is well defined, if its value can be determined in principle with an error as small as desired, i.e., the number can in principle be put in trichotomy with every very well defined rational number. The irrational numbers with definitions that can be handled by humans or computers belong to this class. 

Short answer: This reasoning is questionable and no, "there exists" does not mean there exists exactly one. Longer Answer: First, the reasoning is questionable because you're using 1 as a synonym for existence. However, how is this any different from using any other synonym for existence? Wouldn't the ontological status of 1 then be simply the same as the ontological status of any synonym for existence? What have you done to show 1's ontological status as a number? In all fairness, this has been a problem historically as the status of 1 as a number wasn't always accepted (ditto for 0 whose very invention was considered a major development in mathematics). Second, "there exists" (the Existential Quantifier) is true if the property holds for at least one of the entities. So if the property holds for any number of entities (above 0), then it's true. NOTE: This completely avoids the question of what existence means in this case. That's a can of worms I'm not about to open -- at least not in this response :) 

Premise (1) is false. That alone causes the argument to fall apart. Premise (2) is false. I've had numerous instances of sleep "paralysis" and it is possible to control the body; it's just very difficult. If you really focus hard and try to lift a finger or toe, you will do so and will snap out of it. You might as well argue that the mind cannot be part of the body because it's hard to move your limbs when you are tired. To look at your argument another way, take the analogy of a car. Your steering wheel, gas and brake control the car, and they are a part of it. Yet if the connections from these components to the wheels, engine, etc... are severed, they will fail to control the car. Do you then argue that these are not part of the car because they could be severed? Also, to beat this mind-body dualism dead horse, what about what happens to the mind when the body is damaged? For instance, if one were hit hard on the head, one would lose consciousness. How do you claim mind body dualism when the mind ceases upon damage to the body? Do you claim that the mind is separate, yet dependent upon the body? Is such a position even coherent? 

Meanwhile Cantor's followers believe in "real" numbers that cannot be defined or used in any way (Cantor himself did not as we must say in his favour). Even uncountable alphabets (i.e., unlistable lists) are accepted. The whole matter has completely pushed out the former precision and definiteness of the "Queen of Sciences". 

If a moment is more than a point in time, say a year, then only a finite number can have elapsed, at least as far as we can research it. Assume that our present time is zero. Go back in time by a number of years. Will you ever have gone back by an infinite number of years? No. The reason is that this number does not exist. Time is potentially infinite, i.e., for every number of years you can imagine a larger number. There is no bound. But you cannot imagine an infinite number, because actual infinity has no predecessor but time has no gaps. Note that even Georg Cantor, one of the strongest advocates of actual infinity or transfinity, denied that an infinite time can have elapsed: 

However this facet of presently used logic is rather inconsequential because all results of research concerning infinite sets are irrelevant for any real application. 

Logic and mathematics are not independent of reality but have been abstracted from reality and are relying on tools of reality when being pursued and expressed in monologue, dialoge and general discourse. Unfortunately this fact has not been recognized even by otherwise very able men. Einstein asks: "How is it possible that mathematics, which is a product of human thinking independent of all experience, fits reality in such an excellent way?" [A. Einstein: "Geometrie und Erfahrung", Festvortrag, Berlin (1921), reprinted in A. Einstein: "Mein Weltbild", C. Seelig (ed.), Ullstein, Frankfurt (1966) p. 119] Without mental images from sensory impressions and experience thinking is impossible. Without reality (which includes the apparatus required for thinking as well as the objects of thinking – we never think of an abstractum "number 3" but always of three things or the written 3 or the spoken word or any materialization which could have supplied the abstraction) mathematics could not have evolved like a universe could not have evolved without energy and mass. Therefore real mathematics agrees with reality in the excellent way it does. Einstein answers his question in a relativizing way: "In so far the theorems of mathematics concern reality they are not certain, and in so far as they are certain they do not concern reality." [loc cit] He states a contraposition (R ==> ¬C) <==> (C ==> ¬R). Both statements are equivalent. Both statements are false. To contradict them a counterexample is sufficient. A theorem of mathematics is the law of commutation of addition of natural numbers a + b = b + a. It can be proven in every case in the reality of a wallet with two pockets. 

I would just grant Nietzsche charity here since the excerpt is a literary writing. If it was the case he was making a formal argument word choice based on the historical context of when and where it was written and defined terms of the author would come into play. This may lead to people naturally object since most writings from philosophers are not formalized arguments. While I agree most did not make abounding volumes of formal arguments it is not to say the literary works are without merit. Instead I would suggest non-formal arguments as much weaker when it comes to their philosophical value, yet much stronger when it comes to pop-culture persuasion of the general public. Both approaches have merit, though it is my expectation that modern philosophers do double duty through the exercise of writing both formal and informal arguments for the position for the two audiences to make the strongest case possible. 

This leads to Solipsism aka. how do you not know we are brains in a jar. From a pragmatic perspective this epistemology is unproductive since it doesn't get us anywhere. Some philosophers still regress to this state today. Although taking the questioning back this far is 'ok' as a thought experiment, living with this notion as being correct or using it as a defense against a claim or argument is intellectually dishonest since if they believe they are a brain in a jar they should not be participating in the discussion at all. Solipsism can be debunked as begging the question or being unfalsifible depending on the specific variation and the opponents epistemology. 

The position is always that way because it is the only rational one. Certainly nobody will contradict if the situation is the following: A terrorist is about to ignite a nuclear bomb in a big city but you could kill him before he is doing harm. Now, how large must the city be in order to kill him? 

A set is not a container but only its contentents. So one can take the position: Without contents no set. For modern set theorists there is no problem because they are trained to be attracted by obviously counterintuitive or counterfactual properties (like the axiom of choice in cases where a choice, i.e., a real distinction of one element from all others is impossible). But even the founders of set theory considered the empty set as problematic or not existent. In the following I quote some rarely known statements. Bernard Bolzano, the inventor of the notion set (Menge) in mathematics would not have named a nothing an empty set. In German the word set has the meaning of many or great quantity. Often we find in German texts the expression große (great or large) Menge, rarely the expression kleine (small) Menge. Therefore Bolzano apologizes for using this word in case of sets having only two elements: "Allow me to call also a collection containing only two parts a set." [J. Berg (ed.): B. Bolzano, Einleitung zur Grössenlehre, Friedrich Frommann Verlag, Stuttgart (1975) p. 152] Also Richard Dedekind discarded the empty set. But he accepted the singleton, i.e., the non-empty set of less than two elements: "For the uniformity of the wording it is useful to permit also the special case that a system S consists of a single (of one and only one) element a, i.e., that the thing a is element of S but every thing different from a is not an element of S. The empty system, however, which does not contain any element shall be excluded completely for certain reasons, although it might be convenient for other investigations to fabricate such." [R. Dedekind: "Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?" Vieweg, Braunschweig 1887, 2nd ed. (1893) p. 2] Bertrand Russell considered an empty class as not existing: "An existent class is a class having at least one member." [Bertrand Russell: "On some difficulties in the theory of transfinite numbers and order types", Proc. London Math. Soc. (2) 4 (1906) p. 47] Georg Cantor mentioned the empty set with some reservations and only once in all his work: "Further it is useful to have a symbol expressing the absence of points. We choose for that sake the letter O. P = O means that the set P does not contain any single point. So it is, strictly speaking, not existing as such." [Cantor, p. 146] And even Ernst Zermelo who made the "Axiom II There is an (improper) set, the 'null-set' 0 which does not contain any element" [E. Zermelo: "Untersuchungen über die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I", Mathematische Annalen 65 (1908) p. 263], this same Zermelo himself said in private correspondence: "It is not a genuine set and was introduced by me only for formal reasons." [E. Zermelo, letter to A. Fraenkel (1 March 1921)] "I increasingly doubt the justifiability of the 'null set'. Perhaps one can dispense with it by restricting the axiom of separation in a suitable way. Indeed, it serves only the purpose of formal simplification." [E. Zermelo, letter to A. Fraenkel (9 May 1921)] So it is all the more courageous that Zermelo based his number system completely on the empty set: { } = 0, {{ }} = 1, {{{ }}} = 2, and so on. He knew at least that there is only one empty set. But many ways to create the empty set could be devised, like the empty set of numbers, the empty set of bananas, the empty set of unicorns, the uncountably many empty sets of all real singletons, and the empty set of all these empty sets. Is it the emptiest set? Anyhow, "zero things" means "no things". So we can safely say (pun intended): Nothing is named the empty set. 

If they spent some time clarifying their terms, this argument would not arise. The problem with natural language arguments is that often, people talk about different things, so it's a waste of time. The greater part of such debates should be to clarify terms, and when that is done, often one realizes there was never any argument to begin with, just semantic confusion. As for the moral of the story, whether it's irrelevant depends on how one treats Buddhism. For those who take Buddhism to be a philosophy concerned with the relief of suffering, these details are irrelevant. For those who take Buddhism as a religion (and consider the person of the Buddha to be central), these details are of supreme importance. 

There's a distinction between language and reality. Language consists of verbal behaviors and concepts which may or may not have a correspondence to reality. So having a word doesn't mean that there's a corresponding object. Previous posters have mentioned classic examples like unicorns or even the obviously logical contradiction of square circles. But there's something else here that you touch upon which I think has some validity. Is nothing really the complete absence of anything? We can see many examples which seem to contradict this, all of which revolve around the fact that these nothings seem to do some real work. For instance, you bring up 0. 0 is supposed to be nothing, no quantity, yet its role in math is significant, and some consider it one of the most important developments in mathematics, possibly being the thing that made positional notation practical and with it, the relative ease of calculation that we have today. It's hard to imagine something not existing (having unreality) while simultaneously having this very real effect. Or take the more mundane example of the space inside a cup. A cup is hollow inside, hence most people would think there's nothing there. Yet, it's this nothing that allows the cup to hold fluid, and which gives it its use. Without this nothing -- with a "filled cup" we'd have a useless chunk of matter. So really, maybe nothing isn't nothing? If something exists in some level -- even as a contradictory idea -- it can have some impact on reality. Unicorns don't exist, but the idea of them has caused paintings, shows, etc... to feature them. That's certainly something. Square circles don't exist, yet we write about them, discuss them, and their analogies involve our discourse on contradictions. That's certainly something. So we use nothing in a relative sense, not in an absolute sense.
