More formally, $p_j=p_m=0$ is the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium To be slightly more formal, let us check that $p_m=p_j=0$ is indeed a (Nash) equilibrium of the subgame in which both firms simultaneously set $p\in\mathbb{R}$ with the lowest priced firm capturing the entire (finite) demand. Neither party can profit by deviating to $p<0$ as this yields negative profits. A deviation to any $p>0$ results in the rival firm having a lower price so demand (and profits) are zero---again not profitable. Thus, there is no profitable deviation and $p_i=p_m=0$ is an equilibrium. Is there another pure strategy equilibrium with some $p>0$? The answer is no. Consider the three possibilities and observe how a profitable deviation can be constructed for each: 

Firstly, suppose we take a utilitarian welfare standard that is linear in money. That is to say, suppose that both utility and profits are linear in the amount of money that consumers and firms have (but not necessarily linear in anything else). In that case, the Pareto standard and the utilitarian social welfare criterion coincide exactly! You can see a nice video of Jeff Ely talking about the intuition for this result here (look at the video titled "efficiency"). Intuitively, if both the utility and profits are linear in money then we can always maximise utilitarian welfare by implementing the Pareto optimum and then constructing side-payments to support it. 

Background Since the marginal cost of distribution for a creative work such as a song is now essentially zero, the efficient thing to do would be to provide all songs to listeners at a price of zero (i.e. to allow piracy). However, this neglects the fact that producing creative works involves a fixed up-front cost (e.g. studio recording time, or simply the artist's time composing the work) that cannot be covered if the price is zero. Moreover, it is efficient for producers of 'good' songs (i.e. those that create value in excess of the production cost) to incur the fixed cost, and for producers of bad songs not to do so. The way that society mostly addresses this issue is through the grant of intellectual property (specifically, copyright) protection. The trade-off made is that artists are allowed to act as monopolist suppliers (with all of the attendant inefficiencies) because the resulting profits will give them an incentive to produce in the first place. The fact that a seller's rewards are tied to their monopoly profits means that the most popular artists should, in principle, have the biggest incentive to create. Efficiency effect of piracy If one buys the idea that we need IP protection to induce the production of creative work then tolerating widespread piracy is a bad idea because it takes away the profit that is supposed to provide artists with the incentive to create. Whilst each individual instance of piracy might be efficient, the overall effect of reducing the number of works produced might not. It is then necessary to ensure that enough people do not pirate enough of the time to keep the rewards from production at a sufficient level. People should be expected to pirate if the benefits from doing do (free consumption of creative works) exceed the costs (determined by likelihood of being prosecuted and the penalty when prosecuted). An obvious way to stop people from pirating is to increase this cost by prosecuting more peopleâ€”even if you don't really care that much about winning. Indeed, the main objective is not to win the case and get what, to the RIAA is pocket change; rather, the objective is to scare people enough that they start buying rather than pirating music. [n.b. The RIAA would have to win at least some of the cases, otherwise the threat would be completely empty. As Densep notes in a comment, this raises the issue of whether we can really call these cases SLAPPs or not]. If the result is that artists earn more money and respond by producing more creative works then this can indeed be efficient. Some tangential remarks The last qualifier (if the result is that artists earn more money and respond by producing more creative works then this can indeed be efficient) is non-trivial. There is some debate about how elastic the supply of creative works really is to the rate of piracy and whether this effect is big enough to offset the efficiency gains that come from consuming creative goods at marginal cost (i.e. zero). My sense is also that there is a consensus among economists that the existing degree of copyright protection (typically something like the entire life of the author plus an additional seventy years) is far more generous than the level necessary to induce efficient levels of creative goods production. Lastly, there are other ways of providing an incentive to create. For example, instead of granting an intellectual monopoly, the state can insist that all creative works are freely available and instead reward artists with a lump-sum prize. This avoids the monopoly distortion, but has a couple of drawbacks: (i) the prize would have to be funded somehow (e.g. from taxation, which is itself distortionary); (ii) it would be necessary to find a way to ensure that prizes are only given to reward the right kinds of music. The advantage of the intellectual property approach is that the market automatically rewards popular songs more. 

With apologies for the somewhat journalistic answer (as others have noted, even defining a bubble in a rigorous fashion is difficult). Information on housing supply may be of some use. Demand for housing is quite inelastic (everyone needs somewhere to live) so shifts in supply should show up mostly in prices and less in market quantities. As an example, the UK has experience sustained house price inflation since the 1950s. Even during the recent recession, the decrease in UK prices was relatively brief and modest. If ever there was a bubble, surely this is it? 

The book can be read free of charge on Klemperer's website here. Alternatively, it is available in print; here is the publisher's page. 

Likewise, the consumer is indifferent between $(4,4)$ and $(5,5)$ and we can, in this fashion, get an indifference map: 

It should be easy to see how to add other demand curves to generate the rest of the data points. This is actually a common and more general problem: price and quantity are jointly determined by the interaction of supply and demand. Given two data points, it is impossible to determine whether they were caused by a shift in supply or demand or both. There are two solutions to this dilemma: 

By the way, we can compere this equation to the one a normal monopolist would use: $$\frac{p-f}{p}=\frac{1}{\eta}.$$ The reduction in price to internalise the network externality can clearly be seen. 

the externality falls mostly on a single 'large' agent who can therefore engage in Coasian bargaining without the fear of free riding and only incurring transaction costs once. 

McCloskey's Applied Theory of Price is somewhat legendary as a model of clarity. It is, sadly, no longer in print. However, a PDF is available here: $URL$ The level of mathematical sophistication in this book (like in most good economics!) is not that high, but the book gives a deeper look at the important concepts than is to be found in most extant introductory undergraduate texts. If you really want a more mathematically formalised treatment then you are going to have to turn to graduate-level econ books. For microeconomics, the classic text of choice is Microeconomic Theory by Mas-Colell et al. If you do go down the more formal route, I would urge you not to give up on simpler treatments altogether; they're great for building intuition. More than a decade of experience in economics has taught me that good intuition built through simple models is often far more valuable than a less intuitive understanding of a more sophisticated model. 

The first order condition is $U_1(C(Y),Y)=0$, where $U_i$ means the partial derivative with respect to the $i$th argument. Now, totally differentiate with respect to $Y$: $$U_{12}(C(Y),Y)+U_{11}(C(Y),Y)C'(Y)=0.$$ This can be rearranged to give $$C'(Y)=-\frac{U_{12}(C(Y),Y)}{U_{11}(C(Y),Y)}.$$ Usually, we expect the objective function is concave (i.e. $U_{11}<0$), so the sign of $C'(Y)$ is the same as the sign of $U_{12}(C(Y),Y)$. 

There are two ways to organise social security. One scheme is known as fully-funded social security. The alternative is called pay-as-you-go. Fully funded schemes Under a fully-funded scheme, the government collects regular payment from each member. These payments are invested until the member needs to claim (e.g. their pension), at which point the member receives payments from the invested money and the returns that it has generated. This corresponds to the situation you describe where your social security payments are sat in an investment somewhere waiting to go back to you. Pay as you go schemes This may be disturbing reading, so brace yourself! Countries such as the UK and the USA do not use a fully-funded scheme. Instead, a significant portion of their social security provision operates on the basis of a so-called pay-as-you-go scheme in which the money paid by today's workers (e.g. you) is not invested at all. Instead, it is immediately spent on making social security payments to people who are currently retired. The hope is that today's workers, when they eventually retire, will likewise have their pensions paid from the social security contributions of their children (who will by then be working). And so the chain continues, each generation handing money directly to the last with little provision for self-sufficiency. Assessment The obvious problem with this is that the generation of 'boomers' now retiring is unusually large and had unusually few children. Moreover, that generation enjoys unprecedented levels of longevity, meaning that they are likely to claim far more out of the system than they paid in. All this means that current workers face a large burden paying the social security claims of the much larger generation that preceded them. However, we are kind of stuck. If we want to switch to a fully-funded system then somebody has to get a very bad deal. Option 1: current employees have to pay twice (for their own fully-funded retirement and for the pay as you go claims of their parents). Option 2: current workers pay only for their fully-funded retirement and current retirees (who already paid for their parents' pensions) do not receive any pension at all. Neither alternative is very politically tractable. 

Edit: A comment by AndrejaKo reminds me to add that the other very common reason why firms might increase their price is that they have higher costs. However, economics theory predicts that only unit costs (i.e. those that increase when you sell more units) matter for optimal pricing. Thus, for example, the fact that land near a highway is expensive would not seem like a very convincing explanation for high fuel prices (because the land costs the same regardless of how many units of fuel are supplied). But if, for some reason, supplying each litre of fuel was more expensive at highway fuel stations (because, for example, transporting the fuel there is more expensive) then we would indeed have an explanation for higher highway fuel prices.
