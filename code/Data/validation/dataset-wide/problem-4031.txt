here are my class notes for the special case of a fermat cubic. the same argument generalizes to all non singular cubics over algebraically closed fields of charcacteristic p = zero and maybe p > 3. Assume that (x/z)^3 + (y/z)^3 = 1, where x, y,z are polynomial functions of t with no common factors. (since neither x/z nor y/z is constant, neither x nor y is zero.) Multiply through to obtain (1): x^3 + y^3 = z^3, and differentiate to obtain (2): x^2x' + y^2y' = z^2z', where ' denotes differentiation w.r.t. t. Now we want to eliminate the z terms. multiply (1) by z' and (2) by z, and subtract, to obtain z'x^3 + z'y^3 = x'x^2z + y'y^2z. Collecting terms, and factoring gives x^2( xz'-zx') = y^2 ( y'z - yz'). If either ( y'z - yz')=0, or ( xz'-zx') = 0, then both do, and hence by the quotient rule for derivatives, we would have x/z and y/z constant. Since x,y are rel prime, x^2 divides (yz'-zy'), in ^[t], and thus 2.degree(x) ≤ deg(y)+deg(z)-1. Repeating the argument for each of the other two variables, i.e. eliminating the x and y terms, leads to the same inequality with the variables permuted. Adding the 3 inequalities gives 2.[deg(x)+deg(y)+deg(z)] ≤ 2.[deg(x)+deg(y)+deg(z)] - 3, a contradiction. QED. 

It seems useful to give a counterexample to a commonly misunderstood version of upper semi continuity, namely the one stated erroneously in Shafarevich's BAG chapter I, section 6.3, corollary to theorem 7. the correct version assumes the map is proper or is stated locally on the source instead of the target, as in Mumford's red book. E.g. take source and target both = C^3, complex 3 space, and map (x,y,z)-->(x^2,y,z). The subset W = {(1,y,0)} of the target has reducible preimage, namely two isomorphic copies W1, W2 of W. Now blow up the source along one copy W1, and then remove the exceptional curve over one point of W1. Now the composition of the blow down and the original map, has one dimensional fibers over a non closed subset of the target. As a remark on the example of the blowup at one point of the second symmetric product of a genus 2 curve over the complexes, this example shows that the second symmetric product of an algebraic curve can have non algebraic deformations, since that is true for the 2 dimensional compact complex torus. This remark has occurred several times since the paper by Xavier Gomez Mont in about 1979. The lines on a cubic surface are classical, and the conic bundle structure on that surface any one of them gives rise to is also useful. The book by Semple and Roth is laden with classical examples. Perhaps the first occurrence of the use of 4 space to draw conclusions about varieties in 3 space is the paper by Corrado Segre where he studies the quartic surface with a double line in P^3 by projecting to it from an intersection of two quadrics in P^4. This is of course another one in the sequence of del Pezzo surfaces of which the cubic surface is merely the most famous. The example of Schubert's method of degeneration to count the number of lines in P^3 that meet all of 4 general lines is illustrative. One can also combine it with the Plucker embedding of the set of all lines in P^3, computing the hyperplane section of that embedding, and reduce to the fact that this variety is a quadric in P^5. Joe Harris' book is also loaded with nice examples, including "Fano" parameter spaces and their tangent spaces. 

A trivial counterexample is given by a reducible plane curve, and the structure sheaf. Here's another hands on attempt for an irreducible curve. Think of a line bundle on Gamma as obtained from a line bundle on C, by identifying the fibers over identified points of C, via a non zero scalar multiple. Then starting from the trivial line bundle on C, we can identify the fibers over two distinct points which are identified on Gamma, by multiplication say by 2. then the resulting line bundle on Gamma pulls back to the trivial bundle on C, all of whose sections are constant. But no non zero constant section of the trivial bundle on C can glue together by multiplication by 2, to give a section on Gamma. Thus there are non trivial line bundles on Gamma with no non zero sections, but whose pull backs to C are the trivial bundle with non zero constant sections. This should be essentially the same as the long exact sequence answer above. It is precisely the existence of such non trivial bundles on say a nodal Gamma that pull back to trivial bundles on C that give rise to the structure of the jacobian of C as an "extension" of the Jacobian of Gamma, by copies of the multiplicative group of the scalar field. I hope this is ok. One could consult Serre's Algebraic groups and class fields, for a discussion of generalized Jacobians on irreducible singular curves, in terms of their normalizations. 

Pete I agree that locally free is a good geometric intuition for projective. In my algebra class I gave an exercise for the students to prove that the module of tangent vector fields on a 2-sphere is locally free over the ring of smooth functions, and challenged them to show it is not free. If you introduce direct limits, maybe the fact you mentioned about flatness being preserved is a way to motivate it. I.e. you want to take direct limits of finite generated projectives, but they lose the property of projectivity. So what property do they keep? But that may be artificial. it is hard to get away from the points made by Sean Tilson. I guess the difficulty there is that Hom is for many of us more intuitive than tensor. So lifting and extension problems are more intuitive than the distinction between IM and ItensorM. You might review your reasons why flat modules are in the course. If you have an application for them in mind, maybe the application can motivate the concept. In the spirit of "flat families", I used to cling to the geometric fact that a surjective morphism of smooth algebraic varieties is flat if and only if the fiber dimension is constant, but I don't know if you can use that. Those "local criteria for flatness" are usually among the more advanced flatness topics. E.g. that is treated in the books of Matsumura near the end. But this suggests that in some contexts flatness is the algebraic version of locally constant geometry. I have heard that Serre focused on the concept in some of his work relating algebraic and analytic varieties. Maybe the properties he used are illuminating. Great question. 

In addition to the nice answers above, here is a QDOS computation you can do in your head. If you consider a family of form XYZ + tF = 0, where F is a general cubic, then there are infinitely many lines on the three planes XYZ=0, but in the given t direction, the only ones that are limits of lines on F=0 are those passing through pairs of points where F=0 meets the axes of the system of planes XYZ = 0. Since F meets each axis 3 times, there are in each plane 3x3 = 9 lines, for a total of 27 limiting lines, hence the general F had 27 lines. Another: In a family QH+tF = 0 where Q is quadratic, H linear, the limiting lines pass through the 6 points where F meets the conic Q=H=0. Exactly 12 lines on Q and 15 on H do this. (These occur in the book by Beniamino Segre.) Or project the cubic to the plane from a point on itself, after blowing up that point to gain a new exceptional line. The images in P^2 of the lines on the surface, are lines everywhere tangent to the branch curve, which is a quartic. Then the 28 bitangents to a plane quartic finish the computation. There is also a nice computation of the degree of the map from the space of lines to the space of cubics, in Mumford's yellow book, AG I, Complex projective varieties, last chapter. Basically he reduces it to the case of the fermat surface X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + W^3 = 0, where one can solve for the lines by hand. 

“Canonical blowup” of W(r,d), versus usual blowup. This is an attempt to provide examples and further comments on the nice answer of Jack Huizenga to question 2. I apologize if this attempt is more naive than the question and its previous answers. The interest of the question is signaled by the fact that already for r = 0, the relation between the canonical blowup and the usual blowup of W(0,d) at one point, is the content of the Riemann - Kempf singularity theorem. As pointed out above, the “canonical blowup” G(r,d) of W(r,d), (although an abstract blowup in Grothendieck’s sense of some unknown sheaf of ideals), is not a blowup in the usual sense of blowing up a specific closed reduced subvariety such as W(r+1,d), by inserting the projectivized normal cone. It is rather only a naturally computable birational “incidence” map, which is however sometimes a preliminary tool to compute the usual blowup. The usefulness of the “canonical blowup”, it seems to me, is that it is specifically computable, birational, and sometimes smooth. Thus knowing G(r,d) may allow one to calculate the usual geometric blowup of W(r,d) at a point. Note also, the usual blowup of W(r,d) at a point L, depends only on the intrinsic geometry, whereas the “canonical blowup” depends on the representation of W(r,d) as a degeneracy locus for maps of sections of line bundles on C. The intrinsic nature of this representation depends in some sense on the Torelli theorem which asserts that the polarized Jacobian variety of C has only one such representation, i.e. it is not isomorphic to the polarized Jacobian variety of some other curve. W(r,d) is by definition that subset of the Picard variety of a curve C, consisting of points corresponding to line bundles L of degree d with at least r+1 independent sections. The goal is to study the relation between the intrinsic geometry of this set and the analytical properties of L. In the classical case r=0, if g is the genus of C, Riemann showed the multiplicity of W(0,g-1) at L is h^0(C,L), and Kempf generalized work of Mumford and Andreotti-Mayer to compute the projective tangent cone as the union of the spans of the divisors of sections of L, in the “canonical space” PH^0(C;K)* of the curve C. He also did the case of W(0,d). Since G(0,d)-->W(0,d) is a resolution with smooth fibers, the induced map from the usual blowup of G(0,d) along |L| to the usual blowup of W(0,d) at L is computable as the map induced by the derivative of the Abel map, from the projective normal bundle to the fiber |L| in G(0,d), to the projective tangent cone of W(0,d) at L, i.e. to the fiber of the usual blowup of W(0,d) at L. Thus the usual blowup of W(0,d) is computed as the image of the known normal bundle along |L| in the “canonical blowup” G(0,d). This method of computing the usual blowup of W(r,d) is useful only when one can explicitly compute the usual blowup of the canonical blowup G(r,d) along the fiber over L, e.g., when the canonical blowup G(r,d) is smooth along the fiber. Thus on page 240 of ACGH, in Theorem VI.2.1, they generalize Kempf’s theorem to compute the projective tangent cone to W(r,d), i.e. the fiber of the usual blowup, in that case only. (Notice when r = 0, then G(0,d) ≈ C^(d), the symmetric product of C, which is smooth, so the method always applies in the case considered by Kempf.) Their method of proof, using their Lemma II.1.3, assumes birationality of the canonical parametrizing map. This explains their definition of G(r,d), rather than restricting the usual Abel map to C(r,d) which only gives a generic P^r fibration. The simplest example is the model for the canonical blowup of a general double point on the theta divisor W(0,g-1) of a non hyprelliptic curve, namely (a pullback of) the kernel resolution of the discriminant locus {xy-zw = 0} in Mat(2x2). This “canonical blowup” inserts the projectivized kernel of the zero matrix, a copy of P^1, over the singular point at the origin. The induced map of usual blowups of these two varieties, maps the normal bundle along this P^1, isomorphic to P^1xP^1, onto the projectivized tangent cone at the origin of the discriminant locus. In this case the induced map of usual blowups is an isomorphism, i.e. the usual blowup of {xy-zw=0} at the origin is isomorphic to the blowup along the exceptional P^1 of the “canonical blowup”. (In general it seems only that there is a map parametrizing the usual blowup, by the usual blowup of the canonical one.) The previous example is the precise local model for the Abel resolution G(0,3)-->W(0,3) of the theta divisor for a non hyperelliptic curve C of genus 4 by the symmetric cube C^(3) ≈ G(0,3), of the curve C. I.e. the Abel resolution C^(3) contains the fiber |L| ≈ P^1 over a line bundle L with h^0(L) = 2, and is isomorphic to the “canonical blowup”. The usual blowup of the theta divisor W(0,3) inserts a copy of P^1xP^1. Note moreover that the fiber of the usual blowup of W(0,3) at a point L with h^0(L) = 2, is the unique quadric surface in the P^3 containing the canonical curve C, and the two Abel fibers |L| and |K-L| are the systems of divisors cut by the two rulings of that quadric. Thus the two fibers of the “canonical blowup” of W(0,3) over the points L and K-L, correspond to blowing down the fiber of the usual blowup along opposite rulings to obtain two different copies of P^1. If C is a generic curve of genus 5, the subvariety W(1,4) is just the singular locus of W(0,4). The canonical blowup of W(0,4) is the Abel map C^(4) ≈ G(0,4)-->W(0,4), and the inverse image of W(1,4) is a P^1 bundle over it. In the usual blowup of W(0,4) along W(1,4), the inverse image of each point of W(1,4) is a smooth quadric surface. Thus the usual blowup of W(0,4) along W(1,4), is obtained from the canonical blowup G(0,4) by blowing up further along the inverse image C(1,4) of W(1,4). This situation is just the same as the previous one from genus 4, but with parameters. Equivalently, the canonical blowup of W(0,4) along W(1,4), is again obtained by first performing the usual blowup, and then partially blowing down the exceptional locus, a bundle of quadric surfaces over W(1,4), to obtain a P^1 bundle over W(1,4). As Jack Huizenga suggested, in general perhaps one obtains the canonical blowup of W(r,d) by repeatedly blowing up in the usual sense along subvarieties W(s,d) with s > r, or their total transforms, and finally blowing down partially once. In the case of the theta divisor of a Prym variety there is no Torelli theorem, and Brill Noether representations and the associated Abel-Prym maps are neither intrinsic to the geometry of the polarized Prym variety, nor birational. Indeed since the Prym theta divisor lies inside W(1,g-1), the Abel-Prym map is generically a P^1 fibration. For these reasons in Appendix C of chapter VI of ACGH there were no analogous results given for Prym varieties. More recently some intrinsic information about the Prym theta divisor, such as the degree of the tangent cone at a point, has been computed in terms of invariants of the curves associated to any representation. $URL$ The primary obstacle to parametrizing the tangent cone is the source spaces of the Abel-Prym map, the Prym divisor varieties, are not always smooth. When a smooth one exists one obtains an analogous parametrization of the tangent cone of the Prym theta divisor, i.e. of the fiber of the usual blowup, by the linear normal bundle to the fiber of the Abel-Prym map, although not a birational one. Even in some non smooth cases, such as a Prym representation of the intermediate Jacobian of a cubic threefold, one can still calculate the parametrization of the tangent cone to the Prym theta divisor by the non linear normal cone along the fiber of the Abel-Prym map.
