Man (or any other Earth life-form) cannot live in the vacuum of space. We are fueled by chemical reactions and in space there's nothing to eat or breathe. We (perhaps) could be made to survive, for short periods, to vacuum, but that is probably not worth the effort. The array of adverse reactions (see here) is rather long and deeply ingrained with our physiology. Making us hard enough to resist those conditions would also prevent us to function in normal conditions... unless a complete rebuild is envisioned (as suggested by @HenryTaylor), but then I think a completely "artificial" android vessel for our nervous system would be easier, but that would be not much different from wearing always some form of "power suit" (something like the aliens in "Independence Day"). Real problem is we are not something that can live autonomously, in spite of what we like to think. We are part of a complete ecosystem we need to preserve if we want to stay alive and in reasonably good health. We need to ingest varying amounts of Essential nutrients we are unable to synthesize, but that could be fixed adding back long lost synthesis capabilities to this "homo universalis". This won't, however, dispense us with the need to eat "complex" foods containing, at the very least, the three Macronutrients, minerals and water. Here is the problem on feeding on other planets: their biochemistry, even if "similar" will likely be somewhat different from ours and thus we won't be able to feed on this (it would suffice a "simple" change from D-carbohydrates to L-carbohydrates to render them completely useless). This means we will need to take (at least) some of our vegetal and animal "neighbors" with us in our travels. Adapting to "eat whatever" is really not thinkable in any reasonable future. The "obvious" fix for this would be to "integrate", somehow, also some plant functions thus enabling us to synthesize everything we need from inorganic materials; unfortunately the conversion is rather inefficient and that's the reason plants have large sun-catching surfaces and tend to limit movement to a "bare minimum" to use all energy to grow and reproduce (often with help of energy wasting animals). With a great deal of handwaving you could substitute beta-carotenoids (which capture energy photons of wavelength unsuited for chlorophyll and provide needed excitation) with some other compound using some other energy form (electric?) to perform the same function without needing that much sunbathed surface. This is the best I can think of along the lines you wanted: a hybrid creature feeding on raw minerals, water and electricity (??), able to reproduce autonomously on any planet where there's liquid water and a not-too-poisonous atmosphere (energy source remains to be handwaved). My personal opinion is such a "thing" wouldn't be a human any more than a very advanced AI, but, as said, this is strictly personal opinion. 

That orbit is possible, if unstable (would need active correction from space station). You would also be interested to Low Energy Transfer Orbits where you can plan a trip between several bodies (planets or, more easily moons) by switching orbit at certain exchange points. These orbits are "slow" if compared with other solutions, including the classical Hohmann Transfer Orbits, but require very low impulse, perhaps compatible with Space Station attitude engines. 

As others have explained there is a (theoretical) possibility to have such an "animal". The hard part is: "how did it evolve"? Space itself is a harsh place to live. It is even more difficult to dream-up a way where life started. Two possibilities come to mind: 

All this is, obviously, not fully valid in any modern society (actually just writing this down I risk badly), but imprints from a remote past (from even before humankind existed) are deeply ingrained in our instincts. This means it is quite easy to imagine (actually no imagination is needed, they exist) societies where women make advances and males wait for those, but it is difficult to imagine males routinely turning down offers. Situation would be completely different if men would be in position to copulate successfully only once a year (for example); in that case also males would have to chose very carefully where to spend their precious chances. Modern societies have (mostly) disconnected sex from procreation and thus these instincts are bound to wane, sooner or later; unfortunately, if reverting the process will take the same time it took to build it in the first place, we will have to wait a few million years to be cleansed. 

If I get the question right OP asks for feasibility of a targeting device based on sound reflection. Under stated conditions answer is no. As discussed, e.g., here the upper limit of ultrasound range in air is about 200 meters, probably much less with heavy fog. Situation is very different in water. 

You start from wrong assumption money needs to be backed by something material (gold in your case). This was true in ancient history and throughout a good part of Modern Era, but those times are long gone; US was one of the latest countries to cancel "gold conversion" of their currency (1971). Today all currencies are "floating", which means their value is not anchored to anything but the "belief" that piece of paper (or numbers in a computer) is actually worth something. So the answer is: money value has nothing to do with actual gold reserves. If "Government" manages to keep gold loss secret it won't have any effect (beside not being able to pay in gold, of course). OTOH the mere suspect things are going for the worse will have impact, even if gold reserves are intact. This is exactly the mechanism used by "big investors" to "attack" a currency for gain: star selling "short" the currency generating the feeling it's worthless and buy it back cheap after value drops. This works better if there are other reasons to believe Nation economy is not really healthy... and has nothing to do with gold (or other material) reserves, despite common knowledge. 

Bottom line: insect do not need to have an Immune System that learns in their lifespan because it is too short; their immune system learns in generations, but it's as efficient as ours. 

The combination of the two can be devastating. The higher energy/volume ratio is achieved by thinner gaps (batteries/supercapacitors) or higher speeds (flywheels); both increment risk of failures. Chemical energy, OTOH, needs a distinct activation energy to release contained energy; even hydrogen leak, however dangerous, will not result in an explosion without a spark. IMHO catalytic power cells converting directly some kind of fuel (methanol, hydrogen, ...) to electricity will be one of future widely used "batteries", if some current limitations are overcome (Elon Musk feels technology is insecure because hydrogen explosion risk, but several of his cars already went on fire quite spectacularly even with "conventional" accumulators). Ethanol-powered cells seem a good bet, at the moment. Note there would also a huge benefit with recharging taking a few seconds instead of many minutes (or hours!).
