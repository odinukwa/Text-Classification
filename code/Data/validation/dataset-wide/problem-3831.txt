You may also check partitions of the unit sphere into regions of equal area and small diameter by Paul Leopardi and use the centers of the largest empty circles inside the generated regions as an approximate solution. 

Background of the question: My interest in that question comes from an attempt to generalize planar convex hulls to graphs and that in turn from the observation, that an optimal round trip through all elements of a finite subset of the points of an Euclidean plane encounters the points in the same (or reverse) order, in which they are encountered around the convex hull. Relation of geodesics to planar convex hulls I finally realized that the gift-wrapping algorithm $URL$ for constructing planar convex hulls could be w.l.o.g. interpreted as starting at a point with minimal $y$-coordinate, heading in positive $x$-direction and that proceeding by chosing as the next point the one that required the least change of direction, the measure of change in that case is the angle between current and subsequent direction. The method of going as straight ahead as possible yields the convex hull as the limit cycle independent of the starting point. Unfortunately the limit cycle need not be unique and can also have self-intersection in the case of general graphs, for which an angle between edges is defined (however, the collection of limit cycles along with their topologies might be interesting on their own). 

Now, the problem and freedom I have, is to determine a set of line(-segments), from which the cell-weights that approximate the function values can be determined. It is clear, that the number of equations must at least equal the number of cells but, as there are no other restrictions, there are various options for choosing the line(-segments) that yield the equations, with different implications on the numerical properties of the resulting least squares problem. 

That problem can be easily solved without the integer constraints via linear programming. It is also possible to solve it via negative cycle cancellation after vertex splitting. 

squaring a function to find its zeroes is generally no good idea; first you can't exploit sign changes of the function values to conclude that a certain intervall must contain a zero (or discontinuity with sign change for left and right limit); another problem is that numeric precision gets worse because the slopes vanish at the zeros of the squared function. Worst case scenario is that a sign transition may not result in a zero of the squared function, e.g. $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} -\sqrt{-(x-0.5)}, & x < 0.5 \\ +\sqrt{+(x-0.5)}+2k, & x \ge 0.5 \end{cases} $$ squaring yields $$ (f(x)-k)^2=abs(x-0.5)+k $$ the original transition from $0$ to $2k$ doesn't generate a zero and applying a derivative-based method like Newton-Raphson produces a ping pong between $0.5-k$ and $0.5+k$. The Numerical Recipes book is probably the best resource to recommend to you. 

if the vertical offset is approximately the same within a vector, then it would be a simple strategy to subtract the mean value in order to 'normalize' the vectors before calculating Euclidean distances. Yet another approach could be to work with the vectors of differences of 'adjacent' coordinate values, which reduces the dimension of vectors by 1. These methods are low hanging fruits; maybe they already suffice to solve your problem. 

Pick a $\sigma \in \Gamma_F$ such that $\sigma |_E$ generates $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. There is an $A \in \mathrm{GL}_n$ such that for all $x \in \Gamma_E$, $\rho(\sigma x \sigma^{-1}) = A \rho(x) A^{-1}$, and if $q$ denotes the order of $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$, we get that $\rho(\sigma^q x \sigma^{-q}) = A^q \rho(x) A^{-q}$, which by irreducibility and Schur's lemma implies that $\rho(\sigma^q) A^{-q} = \lambda \mathrm{Id}$. Choose any $\mu$ such that $\mu^q = \lambda$. Then setting $\rho(\sigma)=\mu A$ is one of the $q$ ways to extend $\rho$. 

Assume $L/k$ normal, and take $\sigma \in G$, which can be extended to an element of $Gal(L/k)$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu} \in L$, and if $\gamma$ is the nontrivial element of $Gal(L/K)$, $\sigma^{-1} \gamma \sigma$ is trivial on $K$, and being nontrivial on $L$ it has to be equal to $\gamma$. So $\gamma\left( \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\mu \right) = \sigma(\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}))/\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, so we can take $\alpha_{\sigma} = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, it is an element of $K$. Now for the other way, take $\tilde{\sigma} \in Gal(\bar{L}/k)$. Denote the restriction of $\tilde{\sigma}$ to $K$ by $\sigma$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}= \pm \alpha_{\sigma}$ (this equality is in $\bar{L}$), so $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \pm \alpha_{\sigma} \sqrt{\mu} \in L$, so $L$ is normal. Consider a set-theoretic section $\sigma \mapsto \tilde{\sigma}$ for the surjective morphism $Gal(L/k) \rightarrow G$. Then the (up to a coboundary) 2-cocycle $\beta_0$ associated to the group extension is given by the formula $\tilde{\sigma} \tilde{\tau} = \beta_0(\sigma,\tau) \widetilde{\sigma \tau}$. Evaluating at $\sqrt{\mu}$ gives the equality between $\beta$ and $\beta_0$, if for every $\sigma \in G$, $\alpha_{\sigma} = \tilde{\sigma}(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$. You can always choose your section so that it is the case (change of section = associating a sign to each $\sigma \in G$). 

You need to add some assumption, otherwise $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ add to a matrix with eigenvalues $1 \pm \sqrt{n}$. Maybe your operators are self-adjoint? 

It is also true for local rings. Let $A$ be a matrix with coefficients in $K = \mathrm{Frac}(R)$, such that $A \mathrm{GL}_n(R) A^{-1} \subset \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. Then in particular, $A (I_n + E_{i,j})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ and $A (I_n+E_{i,i}+E_{i,j}+E_{j,i})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ for all $i \neq j$, so that $a_{i,j} b_{k,l} \in R$ for all $i,j,k,l$, where $a$, $b$ denote the coefficients of $A$, $B:=A^{-1}$. Since $\sum_j a_{1,j}b_{j,1}=1$, there is a $j_0$ such that $a_{1,j_0} b_{j_0,1} \in R^{\times}$. Let $A'=a_{1,j_0}^{-1} A$. Then the coefficients of $A'^{-1} = a_{1,j_0} B$ are in $R$, and those of $A'$ also because $\frac{a_{i,j}}{a_{1,j_0} }= \frac{a_{i,j}b_{j_0,1}}{a_{1,j_0}b_{j_0,1}} \in R$. For a general $R$, this just shows that $A \in K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n (R_m) $ for any maximal ideal $m$ of $R$. Edit: This implies that the normalizer is indeed $K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$ in the case $R$ is a UFD. Indeed we have that $I^n=(\det (A))$ where $I=\sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} R$ by localization ($i/\det(A) \in \cap_m R_m = R$ for any $i$ product of $n$ coefficients of $A$). Looking at decompositions, we see that $\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j})^n = \det(A)$, and so $A/\\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j}) \in \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. 

EDIT: There's a left/right action problem, because $\beta_0(\sigma,\tau) = \sigma(\alpha_{\tau}) \alpha_{\sigma} \alpha_{\sigma \tau}^{-1}$ with what I wrote. I think it has to do with the fact that you use exponential notation, so somehow your action is on the right? Maybe you define $x^{\sigma} = \sigma^{-1}(x)$? Otherwise the definition of $\beta$ doesn't make it a 2-cocycle, with the definitions I know. Could you clarify?
