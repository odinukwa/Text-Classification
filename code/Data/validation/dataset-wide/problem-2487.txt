According to dependent origination I took birth (i.e I came into existence) due to ignorance. My questions are :how many times it has happened that someone has taken birth into this samsara? Since when birth of ignorance has been happening? If there are no answers in the scriptures to the above questions then what is your personal opinion on the issues mentioned above? 

I acknowledge that there is no-self. But now I don't know what to do. Previously I was driving a bus called life. Now I am no more the driver because according to anatta , I am not the driver. Since no one can replace me as a driver because each one of us is without self,I am seating on a bus without any driver. I think discovery of anatta means that I should stop thinking about controlling life. Infact I should stop thinking at all because I am not the thinker or the thoughts.(In other words I would not like to associate with thoughts or the thinker) My question is: How to live life after acknowledging anatta? And how can I change the direction of the bus called life? 

It is not that you existed and then you ceased to be after learning Buddhism. You never existed. You did no action. Your identity of self was an illusion. If you did not do any anything in the past then will you do anything in the future ? No. If you did not do anything in the past then will you do anything in the present ? No. Give up the identity of Self. Give up the desire to be Mr. Somebody. None of the identities are worth identifying as Self. 

We are all suffering. This knowledge results in compassion. Buddha was compassionate. And courageous too. My question is : Is there any aspect of knowledge which results in courage? 

If following a person 'religiously'(or sincerely) is called religion then Buddhism is a religion. Buddhism is a religion which denies itself. It denies its own existence as absolute just as your existence is not absolute. Buddhism or Dhamma can be 'used' to reach to the shore of Nirvana and then you will have to abandon the religion or dhamma. Most religions follow the guidelines given God. I have generalized the definition of religion by saying following a person's guideline sincerely is called a religion. Under that definition of religion Buddhism stands apart as a religion. BTW , for all practical purposes one can take Buddha as the God, because isn't following such a good person equivalent to following a good God? 

Namo Buddhaya. I will give a logical answer. Logically there is no self(no self which is permanent, unchanging and blissful). I am different from what I was 10 years ago and I will be different from what I am today. However my past is connected with the present and the present is connected with the future through Karma. It is like, I started off as milk then I became curd then I became Ghee and so on... I am different in many ways and similar in many ways with the past. But there is no permanent identity which can be called as ME. And there is no unchanging identify which can be called as ME. The sense of Self which gets generated is due to craving. Craving for the five aggregates.If you stop clinging to the five aggregates the sense of self will disappear and also will the suffering. The self which you think exists is nothing more than illusion. The reality is that there is nothing worth clinging to in terms of form, feelings ,perceptions, consciousness and volitional formations because they are not permanent, unchanging and blissful. This fact remains undisputed whether Buddha arises or not. Whether you are a Buddhist or not. Anatta remains true. In my opinion we need to support the long story from Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra with more examples. Buddha would have explained that in many other ways as he was Great Teacher. 

As I said it is generally your own karma which confronts you with bad situations. Do not run away from it. Do not fill your heart with hate. Just realize that what is needed is more compassion and not less. I quote a famous verse from Dhammapada: 

Experience of Anatta is not complete unless you have felt revulsion towards body, revulsion towards feelings, revulsion towards perceptions, revulsion consciousness and revulsion towards volitional formations. It is easy to feel revulsion towards body because it decays and dies but it is difficult to feel revulsion towards mind,mentality and consciousness. In order to feel revulsion towards that you must learn dependent origination i.e one thing gives rise to another and cessation of one ceases another. This is beautifully explained in the this sutta.I quote the experience part for your benefit : 

I came to know about Buddhism very late in my life. It is the time for me to relearn the fundamentals of life. But I struggle with everyday activity. I lack energy. In fact I have a diabetes. My past Karma has been bad enough to get me a disease. My question is: How can Buddhism help me get rid of this disease? If I fix my Karma then will the suffering due to the disease will disappear ? If yes, how can I repent and to whom ? 

I think what Buddhism teaches is entirely different in this context. I will resort to logic to answer some of your questions. Below I question the understanding of Nirguna Brahman: 

Buddha says all phenomenon are nonself. If understanding is a phenomenon then my understanding of Dhamma will fade away and I will again fall into ignorance. So my question is: is understanding a phenomenon? 

This link mentions that there is an existence of uncreate state of self(opposite of created state of self..correct me if I am wrong..). 

Namo Buddhaya. Yesterday a person came to me and said he was bit by a dog and then he asked for money to buy medicines as he had none as he was poor. I gave the money to him.But I wonder whether people fake suffering to win sympathy and/or money ? Should I compromise my pride in honesty to help these fake people ? How should I respond to people who fake suffering ? 

I couldn't find any link which could support the above mentioned meditation theory. So my questions are: Is it true that there are 5 principal types of Meditations? Can anyone provide me the original links where Buddha lays down the above mentioned 5 types of meditation? 

Namo Buddhaya. I strongly identify with body. I see myself in the mirror and I immediately recognize that that is me. Such a identification is against Dhamma. How can I disidentify with my body? Along what lines of thinking should I prove to myself that the person in mirror is not me or mine? Note:- Dhamma means teachings of Anatta. Question is related to practice of Dhamma. 

Extending the above analogy, can I say that,this question exists but no questioner is found? Can I also say that, choice to answer this question exists but no choice maker will be found? If you answer the above questions then haven't you yourself made the choice ? EDIT: Some people have raised doubt over the validity of the quote above saying that this is not the mainstream Buddhist thought. To further support the argument that there is no sufferer I quote from the book Buddha: His Life ,His Doctrine ,His Order BY Dr. Hermann Oldenberg(page 253): 

Namo Buddhaya.I have a habit of playing involuntary songs in my head which spoils my mood. I am a living library of songs. I have been hearing music since my childhood days. My question is : how can I cure the music influence on my mind ? Should I stop listening to songs ? 

I will try to prove that volitional formations are no proof of Self. Volition is one of the few things conditional Self is made up of. Is Volitional formations permanent or impermanent ? It is impermanent. You can show free will now but you will be thrown into situations where you will have no free will. There will be times when things will not happen according to your will. When you have free will you will say " I have found myself" and when you will have no free will you will say " I have lost myself".Clearly presence of free will is no sign of self because you can exist even without the presence of free will. Is what is impermanent cause of suffering? Yes it is cause of suffering. Is what is impermanent ,cause of suffering and changeable fit to be regarded as 'Me, mine or myself'? No. Therefore any kind of volitional formation whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all volitional formations should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' 

What is worth desiring from the world when everything is impermanent ? I can't even desire Nirvana , because I never get it. Here it states that I can not say Nibbana as mine or me or myself( I can not say I am in state of Nibbana and I can not say Nibbana as mine): 

As per my understanding ,all phenomenon are nonself. Eventually any self identification which you have, will get discarded because it will pass away. You think you are Arturia but Arturia will pass away. You will have no choice but to give up the identity of Arturia as an error,illusion or a dream and move on. You will adopt new identity which will again pass away...and so on. If we discard one identity as error , illusion or a dream then we must discard all identities as error,illusion or a dream. If there is no Self which can be considered as me, mine or myself then what should we conclude about yourself now? Now you are living an identity which will eventually pass away. This is not you. That realization is Wisdom. The Truth. Below I quote from accesstoinsight.org: 

What is atman? If you refer to atman as a soul which transmigrates after death then you are wrong. There is no soul which transmigrates after death. Rebirth is just an echo of what was the last consciousness at the time of death. Rebirth is like a stanza learned by student from a teacher. If you refer to atman which is the listener of the ears, seer of the eyes, smeller of the nose, comprehender of the mind then again I am afraid Buddha says there is no such atman. Buddha goes on to say there is no Atman... Atman is like a illusion. In other words there is no self worth identifying as my or your soul. Like all illusions, the illusion of atman must collapse. Once that happens gates of Nirvana opens for you. As you see the concept of Atman and Anatta are opposite of each other. Hindus live in the world of Brahman... Understanding of Brahman is the ultimate goal. Buddhists do not live in any such world. Therefore I am afraid Buddhist philosophy leads to a different state of mind. Should we describe that state as blissful ? That I can not answer for sure but it seems blissful is the right answer. Is that blissfulness permanent ? Yes in both the cases it is said to be so. Is that blissfulness me ? Hindus says Yes that blessedness is your self. Buddhists say there is no self. 

Many of us have been trying hard to understand the Dhamma which essentially teaches impermanence,unsatisfactoriness & nonself. Buddha famously did not give answer to Vacchagotta's direct question "Is there a self ?" However Buddha definitely said that "all phenomenon are nonself". Suppose I ask you : Do you experience presence of self now? What would be the honest reply? 

However while elucidating dependent origination Buddha says Consciousness is the cause and condition for Name and form. 

I think anatta means nonself. Nonself means realizing that no self can be considered as I am because every identification of self passes away, and is the cause of suffering and is changeable. 

( I am asking this question to understand the depths of knowledge... I am trying not to take delight in asking such questions.Buddha says one should not even take delight in Nibbana.) 

I have seen worst. I have seen people eating animals alive. I have also seen people killing people. Your crime is not too big. You should focus on keeping your heart clean. Keep your conscience clean. If you feel you have done wrong i.e. you have been cruel to insects then ask for forgiveness by practicing non violence for the rest of your life.And promise not to repeat such mistakes. If you feel you have done nothing wrong then ask yourself why it was necessary? How it solved the problems of humanity ? Keep your conscience clean. If you don't have conscience then you need to develop it by practicing good will and compassion. 

Namo Buddhaya. For my survival I work but I do not like the work. I am always thinking of escaping it. But if I escape from it then how will I eat ? It is my only source of income. My question is : Should I do what I don't want to do especially if it is required for survival ? Should I start clinging to my work ? Or Should I start loving my work? If I should start loving my work then will it not automatically create clinging to the work ? In other words will I not miss the work when the work is gone ? 

I am trying to understand Dhamma. If people ask me what is my Dhamma I say I am XXX , which explains my behavior to them. Suppose I ask you the same question ,What is your Dhamma? ,then what will be your answer? 

Does drowsiness as a defilement only refer to a psychological state of mind? I know that emotions manifest also as physical phenomena, but how do I distinguish between physical exhaustion and psychological defilement? Drowsiness depends both on the psychological state and physical state. There is nothing purely psychological or purely physical. Both psychological and physical changes can occur simultaneously depending upon the choices you make regarding your mind and/or body. If I am done with my job or school I'm feeling sometimes exhausted. How do I know if I have this defilement in me? Now of course if I ate a lot then it's clearly a defilement. Yes. It is a defilement. It is the lack of energy which is causing you to exhaust quickly. Any thoughts or sutta references? Yes. Buddha understood this problem and came up with a great solution. Please go through what I discovered here. 

You will have to admit that the conditional self made the decision when it can. Illusion is not lowly. And the world is not as real as you think. I will explain below. As far my understanding goes all phenomenon are transitory. World is a phenomenon.Whatever had a beginning must have an end. The world had a beginning and therefore it must have an end.Therefore world is an illusion too because eventually it will pass away like an error or illusion or like a dream. World is also the cause of suffering. World is also nonself. Therefore saying that a "lowly" illusion of Self is causing an impact on "real" world is wrong.
