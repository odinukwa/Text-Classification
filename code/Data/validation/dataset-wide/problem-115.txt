Let's consider the fact that the Sun is actually harmful to most creatures, given the right conditions. Humans around the world get sunburned every day, and millions contract skin cancer every year as a result of UV exposure. What is a sunburn? Though we often don't think of it this way, it's actually a radiation burn that causes cellular damage. The Sun is constantly bombarding us with deadly ultraviolet radiation, and the Earth's ozone layer filters out most of this harmful light. But what about the radiation that makes it through? The vast majority of it is dissipated by melanin, the pigment that gives our skin color. People with darker skin tones - that is to say, more melanin - have been found to be able to handle sun exposure better than fair-skinned people, who tend to burn more easily. But what if someone didn't have any melanin at all? That condition is known as albinism, a disorder that a person or animal is born with and is passed down genetically. In albinos, even the irises of the eyes lack pigment, which is why they appear red: you are seeing straight through to the retina. Normally, the iris contracts and expands to let more or less light in - this is why your pupils appear dilated in dim light, but much smaller in bright light. In the case of an albino's iris, since it is transparent, it cannot effectively block the light entering the eye. Because of this, albinos tend to have difficulty seeing in bright light, and many even experience discomfort or pain. 

But the screen can really display anything, including eyes that, because it's a screen, glow. The reason why the robot would display eyes is another question, but answers include: human-robot relations, appearing less threatening and artificial intelligence. 

A sapient version of the Bake Kujira. A Japanese skeletal whale monster The Ceffyl DÅµr. A shapeshifting Welse counterpart to the Selkie The Selkie. Seal-like Creature that shed their skin on land to become fair maidens The Kelpie. A Scottish counterpart to the Selkie that often appears as a horse or man. The Siren. Similar to the mermaid but usually more elemental A Sapient Abaia . A giant magical eel 

Backstory and Setting I'm forging an alternate history set in the year 2012, a horrible zombie virus is sweeping across America, it spreads extremely quick and is incurable. The infected are basically Dawn of the Dead zombies that are smart, a deadly threat. The Center for Disease Control has decided to save as many of the American people as humanly possible. While the states on the West Coast and central America have already fallen into chaos, the remaining states of the East coast can still be saved; over 100 million people. The government has decided to set up shop in the North-Easternmost states of New York, and have already blown up the bridges and entrances to the island. Now Military rescue Helicopters are spreading across the "Survivor Zone", based on Aircraft carriers. 

They aren't really deities, they're just powerful malcontents tricking people into worshiping them (e.x.: Satan in Christianity) They are really deities, but they're evil and should be opposed (e.x.: Ahriman in Zoroastrianism) They are really deities, but they're the deities of a different place / people / philosophy and so are improper to worship (e.x.: ancient proto-Judaism) They are really deities, but they're just manifestations of my deity (e.x.: various philosophies within Hinduism and Hellenism) 

Be like the Majestic Dolphin. The solution is to have the animal evolve to sleep like a dolphin, with half their brain at a time, though for different reasons. Dolphins on Earth do this to avoid drowning, but the concept is still the same. Without a method like this, your people will have a hard time living without sleep related issue, like the dolphins said "So long and thanks for all the fish, so sad that it must come to this." This opens the door to some interesting psychological and physiological features; 

Lorans; tall, slender pale humanoids that are similar to humans in every way, races include Loraic, which are equivalent to Caucasians and Sub-Loran which are shorter, darker, and more 'animalistic' for lack of a better word. Lokk; Short, broad and furred people with digitigrade legs, tails, and snouts. They don't have true races but instead have breeds (similar to cat breeds, very similar but still different). 

As it's that time of year I thought I'd do a Christmas themed question that is a big problem for the old man up north; Why don't the elves rise up and kill Santa? First let us consider the horrible conditions elves are forced to work in; 

This is tricky, but to do what you want, you're going to need to edit any pterosaur that ever existed, or just cheat. 

A classic image of mermaids are their long flowing hair that swishes in the water. But in the scientifically realistic sense this makes none. The hair would be nothing more than a nuisance to the mermaid getting tangled on rocks and offering handles for potential predators, so why would mermaids evolve hair? 

The dominion of Newfoundland was a part of the British commonwealth from 1907 to 1949 before becoming a part of Canada. They served in both world wars and lasted longer than any independent American state having been an independent nation for 42 years, but could they remain independent? 

Even in places where the same foods are produced and crops do not vary, we tend to see culinary trends. For example, France and Germany have roughly the same climate, a similar landscape but the difference between a spritzkuchen and a croissant is avidly clear. Which had led me to wonder what causes these trends and the best answer to that is simple, food is cultural. For the sake of an example, let's say my culture lives in central Brazil and thus receive 4-8 months of heavy rain followed by 8-4 of dry season, how do I make my culture's culinary practices feel realistic? 

No, sorry This question is fairly simple, can mountains stop tornadoes, but sadly, this is only a myth. 

Now, theoretically, if the Aztecs had domesticated these animals, the history of the Spanish conquest may have ended differently and as CGP Grey explained in one of his videos, just because a species looks like another, the internal behavior affect whether or not ancient people could domesticate them. 

The Thing has the ability to absorb and copy the DNA of any life-form it consumes, allowing it to take on its appearance, memories, and mannerisms. Each individual cell of the Thing is both part of a singular multi-cellular lifeform and a distinct, independent entity at the same time. Therefore to kill it, one much kill every cell of the Thing on the planet. It is implied in the first movie [and outright confirmed in the prequel] that the Thing is unable to replicate dead cells; including metal and cloth. 

Could the Aztecs have domesticated this pig-like animal? If they could, when is the earliest they could have? 

The former strategy is to edit what the inside biology looks like in a pterosaur. I would suggest making ancient, before extinction pterosaurs evolve warm bloodedness inside of being cold blooded, also making them omnivores will help them survive the super winter that the meteor will cause, but there is another solution. Just cheat! If you look at current bat evolution, some speculative and future biologists suggest they are evolving to have wings akin to a pterosaur and this is a real possibility, by having bats evolve much much sooner in earth history, you can possibly have mammal pterosaurs.
