Consider the following example with a Cobb-Douglas production function having total factor productivity $A_t$, labor $L_t$, capital $K_t$, and effort $e_t$: $$ Y_t = A_t K_t^{\alpha} (e_tL_t)^{(1-\alpha)}$$ The intensive margin regards the level of effort $e_t$ (think intensity), and the extensive margin the quantity of labor supplied $L_t$. In a less abstract sense, think about output and hours worked. You can work for 2 hours at a normal pace and create one widget. Or, if you try very hard, you could make one widget in one hour. How do you get the same output from the same worker with different values of $L$? The intensive margin is the answer. 

One example of monetary policy is the Bank of Japan buying the Nikkei as part of its asset purchasing program. Typically, a substantial share of citizens' wealth is connected to returns of their national stock market. Hence, it is generally not a wise move for a fiscal authority to invest public funds (not tied to pension schemes) in broad baskets of stocks. You might try looking into sovereign wealth funds, these are typically gargantuan profit-maximizing investment vehicles wealthy nations use to acquire risky securities. 

This would represent an extreme increase in long-run aggregate supply. In the AS/AD framework, this would result in a long-run increase in production growth and a decrease in the inflation rate. How "badly" it will disrupt today's global market? You've built an assumption that it's bad into your question, but sure, it will be bad for anyone who has invested in current energy sources. It will be fantastic, however, for anyone involved in literally any other entrepreneurial activity. The only disruption in such a sudden and unexpected technology improvement would be that some financial institutions would find themselves overinvested in the energy sector. Insofar as they cannot handle the financial capital losses, there may be a private debt crisis that pushes politicians to bail them out again (ideally using the increases in tax revenues caused by increased productivity), or to simply declare their debt null and void. This would cause some consternation, but given that people tolerated financial bailouts after the housing crisis (where financial assets were wasted without any obvious social benefits at all), it's unlikely that there would be overwhelming protest in such a scenario. The negative impacts of such a productivity shock would only be temporary, however. Energy is one of the limiting factors of production, so free energy would cause production to grow as fast as entrepreneurs can find a use for it, which would be very quickly. 

Imagine a consumption set on the surface of an infinite dimensional unit sphere, where the dimensions are indexed by the counting numbers and represent different varieties of goods. The consumer prefers goods found in higher dimensions. So the 1 unit of good on the second dimension is preferred to the 1 unit of good on the first dimension. Thus, the consumer is never satiated because they would always prefer one unit of a good found in a higher dimension, and there are infinitely many dimensions. But these preferences do not satisfy monotonicity, because you must always give up a little bit of at least one good to acquire more of another. Hence, these preferences are rational, because you can rank all pairs on the surface of the sphere, and transitivity holds trivially. 

The first equation can be written as: $$ r_E(Levered) = \frac{E+D}{E}r_E(Unlevered) - \frac{D}{E}r_D $$ Then, isolating the unlevered return gives: $$ r_E(Unlevered) = \frac{E}{E+D}r_E(Levered) + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D$$ And this is the WACC. 

Check out the following: Jordi Gali; Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle: An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework David Romer; Advanced Macroeconomics Michael Woodford; Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy The first two will ground you in the theory of nominal rigidities and the business cycle. Woodford's book is a good advanced text on the theory of monetary policy. I would not start with Woodford to understand the basic New Keynesian model. Practice problems with the first two books first, then move on to Woodford. 

I found the problem, and now I feel dumb but I suppose I should leave the question up so people can know the potential pitfall and prepare for it better than I did. The problem arose from me misreading (and clearly misunderstanding) the equilibrium conditions for the problem, where it states that the interest rate $r_t$ on loans issued today and paid back tomorrow is equal to $\text{rental}_{t+1}$, the rental rate on capital used tomorrow, which is of course equal to tomorrow's marginal product of capital. I had my problem set up with $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1}$, which is incorrect. This means that yes, we should have $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1} = F_K(K(t+1), H(t+1))$, which makes the exercise a simple algebra problem. I just had my subscripts all messed up! Here's why $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1}$ (summarized from text): If $r_t < \text{rental}_{t+1}$, then under perfect foresight (an assumption of the basic model in the given chapter), people will attempt to borrow infinitely to capture the profit of $\text{rental}_{t+1} - r_t$, and this condition cannot hold in equilibrium. On the other hand, if $r_t > \text{rental}_{t+1}$, then nobody will want to hold capital until the next term, instead attempting to lend all of their funds out. 

I am in the process of working through some problem sets. I have studied some time series, but my knowledge of ARCH models is pretty basic. I am given the following information: $Y_t = a_0 + a_1 Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t | I_{t-1} \sim N(0,h_t)$ and $h_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \alpha_2 \epsilon_{t-2}^2$ I solved for the following, Conditional variance: $E(Y_t | I_{t-1}) = a_0 + a_1 Y_{t-1}= \mu$ then $Var(Y_t)=E[(Y_t- \mu)^2] = E(E_t^2) = ht = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \alpha_2 \epsilon_{t-2}^2$ Unconditional Variance: At this point I think we can create a new series for $Y_t$ since we are not conditioning, so I wrote, $Y_t = a_0 + a_1 (a_0 + a_1 Y_{t-2} + \epsilon_{t-1}) + \epsilon_t$, repeat this infinitely many times and get $Y_t = \frac{a_0}{1-a_1} + \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_1^j \epsilon_{t-j}$ $E(Y_t) = \frac{a_0}{1-a_1}$ and $Var(Y_t) = E[(Y_t - \mu )^2] = \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_1^{2j} \epsilon_{t-j}^2 = (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \alpha_2 \epsilon_{t-2}^2) + a_1^2 (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-2}^2 + \alpha_2 \epsilon_{t-3}^2) + a_1^4(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-3}^2 + \alpha_2 \epsilon_{t-4}^2) + \dots$ I am not sure if this cleans up nicely, but what does this say for the variance? it seems like the unconditional is just going to blow up infinitely (given I could have made a mistake in the derivation of this question). I am also not sure if I should state some stability conditions in this question similar to AR(1) processes (e.g., $\alpha_1 < 1$ and $\alpha_2 < 1$), since these are variances do those conditions apply? If I was to conclude a statement, is it acceptable to stay the model captures volatility clustering via 2 period lags? 

Short answer: Yes, the SRAS curve will shift after the LRAS shifts to return the short-run equilibrium (SRAS/AD) back in line with the long-run equilibrium (LRAS/AD). The reason the SRAS curve doesn't shift immediately with LRAS is that there are so-called "frictions" or "nominal rigidities" such as contracts and information gaps that prevent firms from adjusting supply plans instantly. Long answer: There are two simple "stories" we can tell to explain the dynamics of the elementary AS/AD model: the "inflation gap" story and the "output gap" story. Both of these stories are compatible with each other, so they're usually taught as both occurring at the same time. Inflation gap story: SRAS is modeled as shifting upward when expected price levels increase. We can consider the long-run (expected) equilibrium to occur at the intersection of LRAS and AD, and the short-run (actual) equilibrium to occur at the intersection of SRAS and AD. If you start in a long-run equilibrium where all three curves intersect, but then impose an LRAS shock on the model and shift the curve, then the expected price level and actual short-run price level will differ. This is what we call an inflation gap. As firm owners come to the realization that the supply shock is here to stay, they adjust their production processes to match and the SRAS curve shifts to bring the short-run equilibrium in line with the long-run equilibrium. Output gap story: SRAS is also modeled as shifting whenever prices of factors of production change. Thus the output gap generated by the supply shock becomes relevant, with actual short-run output out of line with the long-run sustainable level marked by the LRAS curve. For example, after a positive LRAS shock, the short-run equilibrium will have less output than the long-run sustainable level. The result is an abundance of resources, and the prices of factors of production will fall, causing firms to increase production and shift the SRAS to the right until actual output matches the long-run sustainable level. An opposite story can be told to explain why SRAS shifts left after a negative LRAS shock. 

Dynamic Programming & Optimal Control by Bertsekas Introduction to Modern Economic Growth by Acemoglu The Acemoglu book, even though it specializes in growth theory, does a very good job presenting continuous time dynamic programming. 

The division comes from the entities guiding these sets of policies. The austerity program falls under fiscal policy, which is controlled by Parliament. Quantitative easing falls under monetary policy, which is controlled by the Bank of England. The policies enacted by these two entities are not necessarily coordinated, and can sometimes work opposite each other's objective. 

Your question touches on seigniorage, which is the revenues a government receives from printing money. The issue is that, while the government may benefit (in the short run) from the additional revenues, the holders of money are penalized because their money becomes less valuable. While a low level of seigniorage is typically acceptable, if it becomes clear a government is going to finance the majority of its expenditures this way, then the government risks hyperinflation and a loss of confidence in the currency. Further, selling bonds can be beneficial for a few reasons. One, when a country participates in international capital markets, the act of paying off debt creates positive relationships with lenders and can lower borrowing costs. Two, it allows a government to smooth its expenditures over time. When the economy returns to healthy growth and is able to generate a surplus, the government will again be able to pay off debt it accumulated during leaner times. 

You generally set the price of "all other goods" to \$1, as "all other goods" is usually measured as "dollars worth of all other goods." Then the maximum quantity of all other goods is just the available income. Then to find the quantity of other goods Hulk buys, just find out how much money is available after he vists the gym 20 times. 

As I had hoped to learn enough macroeconomic theory to get some research ideas, my goal at the beginning of this summer was to read through and complete the problems in an introductory advanced macroeconomics text (my first-year PhD macro courses left me more stunned than enlightened). I started with The McCandless's ABCs of RBCs, and quickly found that it was above my ability level when I reached problems I didn't even know how to set up, so now I'm trying Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics. I've gotta say that after having to consult the solutions manual several times through Chapter 2 out of 12, I'm feeling rather discouraged as the solutions involve methods that are not intuitive to me and not discussed in the text. Is there even any point in someone with my skill level tackling such a task? I can't really see myself being a macroeconomic theorist after this, and it seems that the vast majority of empirical macroeconomic studies use reduced-form linear models backed by hand-waving arguments based on principles or intermediate theory, so I'm starting to doubt the utility of studying advanced theory at all. I understand this may be an an "illegal" question here on Stack Exchange, so I won't protest if it's closed. But if not, does anyone have any tips for how to proceed? 

It is generally not possible to make a sharp statement about the types of non-convex costs that Dynare can handle. Many different factors come into play about whether a model can be "solved" by Dynare or not. Is the steady-state correctly defined? Is the model stationary? Is the model differentiable everywhere in the ergodic set? Are the number of endogenous and exogenous variables equal to the number of equations? Is the model Blanchard-Kahn stable? But, to answer your question, can Dynare solve a model with a state-contingent fixed cost? Yes. This is not difficult, you should try to create one yourself. Try modifying a simple RBC model with capital and bonds. The trouble is not inducing the cost, but rather finding the steady state, which can be quite onerous if not done cleverly. Dynare, however, cannot solve Iacoviello and Pavan 2013 because of the min function found in a borrowing constraint. This min function induces a point in the ergodic set which is not differentiable. Dynare numerically approximates optimal policy functions about a steady state using perturbation methods. This requires employing the implicit function theorem to build out Taylor expansions of the optimal policies, hence you must be able to take derivatives everywhere within the ergodic set. 

Question: Let $N=\{1,2,3\}$ be a set of three people and $X=\{a,b,c,d\}$ a set of 4 political parties. The individuals have the following preferences: Individual 1: $a \succ_1 b \sim_1 c \succ_1 d$ Individual 2: $d \sim_2 a \succ_2 c \succ_2 b$ Individual 3: $a \succ_3 b \succ_3 c \succ_3 d$ List all pairs of $(x,y) \in X \times X$ such that $x$ Pareto dominates $y$ and deduce the optimal Pareto set. I think I am being thrown off by the $X \times X$ bit. But it seems like if I multiply out $X$ I will get the following: $X \times X = \{(a,a),(a,b),(a,c),(a,d),(b,b),(b,c),(b,d),(c,c),(c,d),(d,d)\}$ So if I define the Pareto outcomes as $x \succeq^P y \iff x \succeq_i y$ for all $i=1,\dots,n$. Then my answer to the question would be the pairs are: $(a,b),(a,c)$ since those are the only two combinations which dominate in all three individuals. I don't think it makes sense to examine the $(a,a),(b,b),...$ case, but I could be completely wrong. For some reason I can't seem to wrap my head around it, and I could have gone wrong right from the beginning. 

There was a time when they did, but it's a less common tool of monetary policy now. At any rate, altering the minimum reserve ratio at this point would be pointless due to the huge quantities of excess reserves banks have been holding since the 2008 bailouts and subsequent rounds of quantitative easing. The reserve ratio is a relevant tool of monetary policy only if banks are actually at or near that ratio, which few are at this time. 

Insofar as technology fails to substitute for all menial tasks, economic theory would dictate that those tasks pay a high enough wage to attract workers, so the wage for those jobs would likely be higher than they are in the absence of a UBI. The only serious pushes I see for a universal basic income come in response to the threat of technology advancement making many menial jobs obsolete, so this may not be as big a problem as you worry about (assuming a UBI scheme is in fact sustainable at all). In this context, the UBI is pitched as a way to more quickly distribute the "technology dividend" to displaced labor instead of letting it concentrate in the hands of capital owners. The strongest arguments I've heard for a UBI are based more on positive externalities. Consider how many intelligent people work menial jobs simply because they're the best-paying available. Perhaps if a few dozen hours of their weeks were freed up (for millions of people), they'd be able to engage in intellectual, artistic, or entrepreneurial pursuits with more long-term benefits to economic growth. This result, however, is contingent upon technology advancing fast enough to truly displace labor in the market. If capital equipment doesn't plunge in price to accompany the initial increase in tax costs, this would be a very hard sell.
