legally there is no justification for treating them differently, but society may impose a different standard on them. as an example, if i could be active 24/7 but spent 16 hours a day playing videogames (while working normal hours) i might be judged for it more harshly than someone who sleeps 8 hours, and plays videogames for 8 hours. the only legal change might be relating to overtime pay being reduced for Awakened individuals. 

My solution to this is that the fundamental laws regarding electricity and combustion change, but that living beings are unaffected. Fire beyond a certain intensity becomes unpredictable, or is reduced in it's intensity. Electricity no longer works reliably except in the brain chemistry of living organisms. Only a thin band of combustion and electricity types are effected, meaning that fuel won't burn right, computers won't work, but lightning still happens, and the sun won't fizzle out. As for the why of this all, anything could work. Aliens. Magic. God. The large hadron collider breaks reality. Because I said so. Random change in universal constants. Anything really. 

Is there a pop of increased air pressure when something is conjured? If no, it may be that magic consumes a portion of the matter that is in the place it is being brought into. Air is still a physical material, although not as dense as others. Maybe magic converts air into the created object, with greater efficiency than the particle accelerator. Additional mass and energy costs could either be drawn from the nearby physical mass, or the energy behind magic as a force could fill in those gaps. By this explanation, magical creation would be impossible in the void of space. 

Surprisingly, not much would change Initially, this would disrupt arms dealers, weapons manufacturers, and most world governments with a standing army. There would be some chaos, some confusion, and blame placed everywhere, but overall the impact would be surprisingly small. Possibly even resulting in an overall reduction in violence worldwide. Pneumatic guns have been effectively used in combat in the past, and would quickly replace the old style of combustion firearms. If anything, it could instigate more research and money being invested into weapons research in order to bring air guns, railguns, coilguns, lasers, crossbows and other projectile weapons up to the level of effectiveness that current firearms are at. I would imagine that there would be some tension as the various world leaders scramble for a scapegoat, and others fight each other with crossbows and machetes, but for 1st world countries, the effect would be pulling back all armed forces, retraining them and retrofitting their weapons, then sending them back out and resuming buisness as usual. This would cause probably 1 to 5 years of restructuring and mild chaos in 3rd world countries (most likely resulting in an overall reduction of casualties since guns are so darned efficient at killing things.) Within 10 years, things would be almost completly back to normal, although weapons would be a bit less effective than what we use today. The only notable worldwide change is the opportunity for governments to restrict the usage of newly manufactured air guns to military only, allowing for certain countries to make airtight new gun laws in the wake of this bizarre event. 

Many of the reasons we have for investing in space travel today apply just the same in a post apocalypse wasteland. Several examples come to mind: Establish new satellites for gps and/or real time satellite images. Able to launch satellites as weapons to be activated and dropped later. Use space travel as a way to rediscover various tech secrets by researching with a set goal in mind of space travel. Bragging rights or a show of power. 

Perhaps gems have manifested in a different way than they do in our world, and are in fact the solidified energy of that magic type. Why each magic type has that color could remain vague, but there's a few possibilities that come to mind. The energy types could reflect emotions as color, and once solidified, hold their color indefinitely. There's a lot of options for answers, if this one isn't direct enough, try to refine your question to be more specific. After playing the game that this is largely inspired by, I've decided to add a bit of detail to a specific theory. The in game explanation is that magic crystals are the solid representation of magic, which is an ambient background energy. The four classical elements are the most common type of crystal by far, and their color scheme makes some sense, red=fire, green=air, blue=water, yellow=earth. The others are quite rare, but could still fit into the same framework as the others, but be less common because they are more specific than the four classical elements. Now, as to why each one has the color it does, I can see magic auras being more about how a person's mind filters something so foreign to natural law that it just files it as color to reduce the mental strain, since there is no proper sense for perceiving magic. From there I see two interpretations, Magic colors are Constant and Fixed, Or, Magic colors are fluid, and malleable. 

Condensed Magic only functions as a physical material when it is in contact with living beings. Condensed magic comes in 3 varieties, air, liquid, and solid. For example, if you spilled condensed liquid magic onto a table, it would fall through the table, then fall through the floor, and be impossible to recover. If you held it in your hand, it would behave as if it were a liquid similar to water when in contact with your skin. People can spend their magic points to create this material, and consume it later to replenish their magic point reserves. Magic points replenish on their own, but Condensed magic works like an MP Potion does in most video games. How would a society that uses condensed magic as a form of currency, reliably store these materials for transport and use, if only living matter will contain them after their initial creation? Separate storage methods for each form are acceptable, but a single method is preferable. 

One option that I didn't see listed was to alter or enforce a 'blue book' law. Something that has been on the books, but was never taken seriously enough to be enforced or removed. Laws like this are almost never used by police. You could say that at some point in the past, this law was written, but hasn't been taken seriously. All your government needs to do is instruct the police force to start enforcing this law. Alternately, they could rework, or add onto the existing law in a subtle way that would go unnoticed until the day that it takes effect. 

I'm working on a setting in which all humans have been genetically modified to have access to telekinesis ages ago, and it is now considered a normal thing. It works somewhat like a muscle in that the more you use it, the better you get at using it. It's upper limit, is that you can only impact an item of less than half your weight, less than your own body length away from you. On average, people can only lift between 5% and 10% of their body weight at half their body length away from them. This power cannot be directly used against living material, and the acceleration of an object can't be thrown with any more force with telekinesis than throwing it with muscle force instead. It is not physically strenuous to use telekinesis, but it is mentally strenuous when overused, although it's limits are similar to physical strength in that minor uses don't exhaust you, but using your power beyond your endurance level will leave you tired. Overusing this power way beyond your limit will result in the user passing out or falling asleep with maybe a slight headache when they wake up. This is intended to be a background element that isn't directly important in the story, so I'm looking at finding out how to limit this power so that it isn't the main focus of the story. Now to the point, there are three primary areas where I'm curious as to how this would impact a society. 

I can think of several interesting possibilities from this new phenomenon. Now, keeping in mind, this is somewhat of a 'what if' question leaning towards idea generation, but still, I think it's an interesting question. After the initial shock of this change wears off, people will be looking for ways to exploit or utilize this new dimension. The first thing that comes to mind would be the possibility of linking the respective internet equivalent from both worlds. Depending on how similar the programming language and computer science tech trees are in the parallel world, it could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few years to develop a way for our internet to interface with theirs, effectively doubling the size of the internet. After the internet infrastructures are connected, I can imagine that trade and the stock markets of the respective dimensions would also be linked up after a short amount of time, this could have a huge impact on the world economy, for better or worse, although I would be inclined to think the change would be for the better. Stocks, and trading in actual physical goods across a mirror dimension may be cheaper than trading to a place that is geographically distant but has a larger profit margin, because the transportation costs of trade over a mirror dimension would be much cheaper. The next big change would be that companies could set up facilities which use mirrors to have production on one side of a mirror with storage and transportation on the other. This wouldn't happen overnight, as it would require communication, trust and a common currency between dimensions, but this would be one of the long term opportunities for collaboration. I can imagine this and other similar space saving setups being the biggest overall impact from the event once the dust settles. Another possibility would be for drug cartels and other unsavory types to buy trade and sell drugs and illegal weapons across dimensional barriers where the jurisdiction and active laws may be different. Selling legal over the counter drugs to people in another dimension where their state laws prohibit that kind of sale, probably wouldn't be punishable by your own state/country's laws, as you didn't break any, and their law enforcement cannot reach you. Over time these loopholes would be fixed, but for a while, there would be a lot of money to be made exploiting these differences in legal structure. Gun laws, drug laws, restrictions on over the counter pharmaceuticals, just about any controlled substance or object could be traded with an enormous possibility for profit at a lower risk and expense. 

Assuming you had two cities, one of them an average real world City, and the other identical in every way, except that it's technology cannot advance beyond steam power (Cannot use combustion engines, guns, electricity, etc) And it has magic. These two different cities, both specialize in manufacturing and are trying to outpace each other. There are three main types of magic used by the Magic City: Elemental Magic Allows the manipulation of elemental forces, the closest fictional comparison for overall power level I can give would be Avatar: The Last Airbender. training: it takes 1 year of study to be proficient in one element. It takes 4 years of study to be proficient in all four. Body Magic(Necromancy) Allows people to summon the undead, and give them basic programming-like commands. They are minimally intelligent and non-sentient, but can be made to do repetitive tasks nearly indefinitely unless the body rots beyond usefulness or is damaged. These zombies are slightly weaker than an average human, but do not get exhausted. If the summoner of a zombie dies, their summoned zombies default to attacking the nearest living human. training: To summon one permanent zombie, it takes about two years of intense study of body magic. For every 2 years of additional study (equivalent difficulty to taking a college engineering class) you can summon an additional zombie. Dimensional Magic People can create personal pocket dimensions for storing objects. These pocket dimensions have a maximum capacity in weight equal to a persons maximum lifting capacity. People can create portals from one place to another within line of sight, although this takes a lot of focus, and does not allow for any other tasks while holding a portal open. If a portal is closed on a non-living object, it will slice it through with a flawlessly smooth cut. Living objects are gently shoved outside before it closes. Portals can be enchanted on identically sized openings in such a way that the portals will be active perpetually, and can be moved, but will always be oriented in the same direction. Training: It takes 2 years of study to make dimensional portals of a consistent size and duration. It takes 8 years of study to be able to make permanent enchanted portals. The Questions: Would these types of magic,while being restricted to steam power allow for the magic Powered City to outpace our Real World City in total manufacturing output? What advantages and disadvantages would these types of magic provide?
