Astrological readings. Astrology describe a moment of time with planet positions and the relation between them. For example, a moment of time can be described as follow: Mars in Aries, Mercury in Libra... conjuntion between Jupiter and Mars and Saturn in opposition to the Moon. Each combination might be unique. Neptune for example needs 165 years to make one orbit, so this kind of calendar can be used for a long period of time. 

Basically you need to shut down inmune system in order to perform any kind of transplant. Most tissues in mammals are quite similar, to the point that laboratory rats are good experimental subjects for many things that later will be used in humans. For example, the growing of a human ear inside a rat: 

Under the assumption of no data loss during the transfer (due to any object in the transfer medium). Your system still has two problems. 

That society will last until the first crime or until the first disagreement. Once you have a crime, no matter whether is big or small, the society will realize that they need surveillance to prevent further crimes. When you have a disagreement you need someone to break the tie and make a veredict, hence that creates hierarchy. 

Genetic control The first matter to deal with is to ask what level of genetic modification is possible. If we are limited by standards slightly more advanced than today's, then we have a few options. We can.. Reduce or remove the production of certain catecholamines, deflating some riot situations. Reduce or remove the production of serotonin, causing memory loss. (What was i angry about?) Modifying the image of a "perfect being." More specifically, giving a genetic bias towards a certain leader figure. Studies have shown that completely irrelevant genetic traits have contributed to public image. So what if the perfect match happens to be the current ship captain. Kind of genetic There is the ability to genetically hamper the supply of insulin to artificially administer diabetes. This could very quickly nip rebellions in the bud if the only insulin supplies are located at secure nodes. In the same way, albeit somewhat less cruel, get everyone on a certain drug and watch as rebellions struggle through withdrawal before crawling back in surrender. (Never mind, just as cruel) Other Rather than using genetics (a recipe for some resistant hero to arrive), use neuroscience. As soon as someone gives birth, transport the newborn to a government approved "educational" site, guaranteed to improve IQ by looks in PR folder 20%. What is actually happening is basic conditioning. While curbing any rebellious thoughts for the next 2-3 years, the young will be fed direct associations between rebellion and pain, and conversely be given compliance and reward. As an added bonus, anyone audacious enough to not put their newborn through this liberating process will have the child labeled as being in possession of a lower intelligence. 

Nebulae are indeed what I know as an alternative location as well. They not only contain the essential ingredients (including discharges to help along) but there's rocks passing through them all the time, which is what leads to panspermia according to some theorists. The problem with this, as far as life is concerned, is that when we're talking about "ingredients" and "conditions", we're talking about just enough to form bacteria and very simple organisms (in this case "extremophiles" that can survive space and atmospheric re-entry or first-entry in their case). They can chew on rocks for all time, but there just isn't anything to terraform, in order to allow more complex life to arise. You don't get giant amoebas in space nor space-goats, launching themselves between rocks. Also, this process, while likely in nebulae, would take orders of magnitude more time than it needs on a planet, because everything's so far apart, so you need to allow for a universe that has hundreds of billions of years available to it. Since I can't think of other cases that would count as "space" I'll stop here. To sum up, you can get life in outer space, but it's really really hard to get complex life in space. 

So it looks like you have a very dangerous slime bacteria. Unfortunately, the blob's existence would not necessarily lead to mass extinction. Assuming these blobs can starve, they will likely fall into a predator/prey cycle. 

I believe this implies that answers should address how the AI manages internal infrastructure meaning that humans will, at least in the beginning, manage military affairs, international relations, and other matters that directly effect the economy less immediately, as self-sustenance is a future sub-goal. Short term goal Making everyone happy is impossible, but being an AI it will likely try to maximize human happiness, leading to a myriad of secondary goals. 

Magical ability can simply be mapped to a square root function. More emotion added does not mean an equal addition in power. Instead, the difficulty in increasing power raises with the power, tapering off eventually. Where this tapering happens is based on whatever you would like to use (different for each person, random, etc). The second limitation is in context. There are multiple types of situations we would prefer aren't magically amped-up, like 5-year old tantrums or adolescent blowups. A number of solutions are possible. Maybe magic increases with age or maturity, it may even be blocked by hormones. :) Alternatively just leave the one rule how it is. Instead of modifying the rule, modify society. Who needs cars when you can get angry and run 80 kph. Even tools are useless to a degree as beating your head against a wall actually might smash the wall. 

Energy. The amount of energy to convert mass to energy (twice) is huge, remember the formula E=mc2. This means that transfer a 10 tons of mass means 10^20 [J], which is insane. Information. You are not transfering energy, you're transfering information, data related to how mass should be built. A human body has 7*10^27 atoms, while a terabyte are only 10^12 bytes. So the data transfer assuming a single "wire" will need so much time that the system would be useless to transfer more than few molecules. 

Maybe your issue here is more a problem of weight and availability instead of a problem of health. A way to protect health would be a cyst around each zone with metal, so that might not be a problem. About the weight. Let's imagine we select iron (poor choice because it rusts, but just as an example). Iron density is close to 7800 kg/m3. So a plate of 5mm of iron (enough for your purpose) of 1 m3 would have a weight of 39.4 kg. Human skin has 2 m2 of surface, so you would need almost 80 kg of iron or its equivalent to cover the body. Other metals can be used, but the weight might be similar. Maybe your creature can keep those 80 kg extra. But here is the main issue: ¿From where that creature is going to absorb that amount of metal? ¿How that metal is going to form a crystal in absence of high temperature? After all, a plate of metal requires high temperature to be formed. Otherwise it would be only a bunch of separated atoms. Hence, what you need is a polymer or a compound instead of a pure metal. Something that can be synthetized at lower temperatures; natural examples are spider silk, tooth enamel, silk or lignin. 

But of course, ours would be a lot larger and flatter. Your dome could deploy from the perimeter of the city and once in place, extend titanium panels to fill the gaps. Obviously, it would need some other form of exotic technology to expand so much - perhaps the city has huge stores of molten titanium under it and using some shaping trick it alloys the titanium with tungsten (to give it a higher melting point than plain titanium) and then funnels more titanium through the bars, suspending it through magnetism or something, until it cools into titanium plates. 

The "4f" arrangement seems nice. Just make it spin really fast on all axes. Physical dome A probably preferable mechanical solution could be accomplished by having a deployable dome, that forms a mesh when deployed - then it fills the gaps with matter somehow. I'm thinking of something like this: 

Gravity, as far as I remember from what I've read on ring-worlds, should work through rotation - as the ring rotates around the star, the centrifugal motion keeps everything stuck to the inner surface. That means that if you walk off the edge, you probably are shot straight into space (might be convenient for spacecraft though). The effect would be pretty sharp too. For the atmosphere to not evaporate completely, you'd need gravity and enough material for it to hold together. I'd guess the average atmospheric height would have to be close to Earth's to maintain a similar environment. The issue is, how do you keep it from escaping off the sides? Spillage Before the atmosphere problem is tackled, lets see what other problems could exist: 

Almost definitely not. The sheer amount of energy required to lift an object of this magnitude would be far out of its capabilities. The only plausible escape of gravity would be partial, meaning it would be trivial to fling small pieces of the blob out of the planet's gravity well provided the blob is intelligent enough to even do that. These projectiles would be unguided and not likely land anywhere suitable to consume or reproduce. 

I see these happening automatically given the wide range of opinions on nearly everything, except the last one. Unless abilities are one-in-a-million and relatively new, they will just be a common part of culture. Heritability would stimulate group associations, and stereotyping would further that, however, the most surefire way to implement associations is most likely geographic ability distribution. Some kind of landmark or location bestows abilities in a small radius around itself, whether it covers a town or a country, leads settlers to gradually become affected by -insert ability here-. The fast way: Take a stock super-power, but then add in a caveat that (usually) blows the helping half out of the water. More examples: Subject can quickly understand anything read, but is plagued with short term memory loss, rendering new knowledge generally useless. Shape-shifting normally causes death in the infant stage as it transforms users into their mental images (including non-sentient ones). Some, usually mentally damaged to impair visualization, can eventually grasp the ability, but the risk still remains. 

I think you overestimate how hard it is to hide in space. The size of spacecraft is negligible considering what we're usually observing. Their emissions can be cut quite easily, unless you're using some kind of engine that has high emissions, which again, can probably be reflected or masked. Additionally, celestial bodies are quite large and very effective in blocking signals and emissions. The vastness of space (it's really big) makes it very hard to scan effectively - light takes a long time to reflect, which means you're very dependent on what light is already reflecting off interesting objects. And light's the fastest signal we know. It's also the only one that will work - unless you're measuring field gradient flux or whatever, in which the effect of a ship will be less than background noise. If we were to assume however that indeed it is hard to hide in space, it would be due to your own emissions and reflections. You can easily reduce those to background noise - lining the parts of your ship that cause these emissions with heavy materials will reduce them significantly; you can also remain stationary and pretend to be a rock, if you know where you're likely to be observed from - possibly using camouflage to imitate random rocks reflecting the sun. And always, you can plot a course through debris fields if you're desperate and use them to mask your presence behind them. 

Specifically, what is the exact principle that allows a rain dance to work, but not magical pumpkins. Certainly rain is more plausible, but unless magic is a sentient being capable of understanding plausibility... 

Wikipedia ballparks earth's total biomass at 560 billion tons C*. If the blobs are able to consume all life, given a rough estimate of bacterial volume/weight (0.6um3/picogram) lands a rough mass at. The volume of the Mediterranean Sea (I am skeptical about this answer and open to revisions) 

This question becomes impossible to answer without knowing many other variables such as the rate of consumption, mean time between food discovery, speed of blob, and specific details about the local ecology. The best bet is to maximize surface area by stretching into a pancake like object for the highest food collection rate. *C stands for organically bound carbon or carbon being used in a living system. 

As the population of prey begins to falter, so does the blob's ability to find food. They then begin to die off and the prey population rises again only to repeat the process. But what if they are apex predators. It is possible that, since they eat organic matter, no digestive system could completely dispose of them. Following the next month or so, the blob eats the eater, quickly teaching all species to steer clear.
