Sounds a lot like my previous job... I was contracted to get a start on .NET and Flex projects and in the they put me working on LAMP/WAMP stacks (which is what the company eventually got into and dropped everything else). But in my case I was already familiar with those stacks whereas you will have to take on something new as a challenge. I would say just go with what you've learned already because in the end, these languages/systems are just a tool to meet the end of a goal. As someone just coming out of a training program, you won't have much say in the company until you can produce some results. Leverage your back-end experience to work for Javascript, and learn a framework or two. You'd be surprised how complex the language can be. Also, you'd get a better understanding of how server-client interactions work. Also, understand that the demands of a company may constantly change, as it was in my case. However, we cannot tell exactly from your question if this will be for one project only, or if the company wants to keep you in front-end for the long haul. If you are being compensated fairly, I wouldn't complain about it for now. Part of being a competent and reliable worker is to adapt to the dynamics of the company. 

I have an unusual problem in finding work. I have been in many interviews (over 10 in the past year), but none of them produced any job offers. However, the employers I've interviewed with are impressed by my resume and ability to solve the problems given to show that I would be productive. This leads me to find an observation for most jobs that I apply to (mainly a hard-skills technical job). Everyone needs soft skills to survive the interview process. But for those more inclined for technical work, once the job is held, these soft skills are suddenly not as important or used with the same sense of urgency, or at least they're not the same type of communication skills. They feel underused in the job compared to the interview. As an example, I do not know how to translate my ability to communicate well with co-workers on a long project into the ability to convincing interviewers and play the salesman for saying why I should get the job. Speaking to an interviewer to me feels a lot different and more difficult than speaking to a team member to discuss project goals. I consider then different kinds of communication skills. I probably don't know how make them work at an interview, so here is where I want improvement on. 

I have signed a contract a month ago to start getting consistent work from a company. The boss promised me an average of 25 hours a week (but that wasn't explicitly written), but for the past two weeks there have been no reasons for me to come into the office, as there was, to my surprise, no work being offered to me. Even my boss hasn't shown any concern at me not showing up. Project managers typically come to the employees for more things to do, but they are paid on salary. Here are some relevant statements from the contract: 

We have had a self-proclaimed UX Expert foisted upon our development team recently and it's been nothing but headaches ever since. I am not sure what his background is but he does not know anything about HTML or CSS or browser compatibility, etc. There is no indication that he has ever worked in a development team environment and it has become painfully obvious that his design recommendations are based on his "artistic opinions" which really have no bearing on our application or what we need to accomplish. He doesn't conduct user interviews or testing nor does he do any kind of research from that angle (or any other angle). He does work with BA's and other SME's but he tends to talk at them without really paying attention to the big picture. I understand there is a place for UX professionals out there, but we are not developing a commercial website or application, rather an internal back-office application that will be used by a limited number of people. The quick description is an application for checking account reconciliations and searching for documents and moving documents through workflows, etc. We need something that is fast and easy to use, it doesn't need to be flashy or entertaining, it needs to be solid and dependable and simple and intuitive. The end users will be trained on how to use the application, it's part of their job, and we don't need to dazzle them with intricate page controls or widgets and the simpler it is the better. That's not his mindset or approach at all. Firing the guy is not an option, as he has connections much higher up the food chain. One thing we have tried is putting him with some junior level developers so that he feels like he is in charge of something but that has not worked out for a number of reasons, with a primary reason being that we need them for other tasks. The senior level developers have started ignoring him though because he doesn't understand or care about what they have tried to tell him about his recommendations. As the Team Lead I have expressed to him our concerns but it is not getting through - he thinks that since he is the UX Expert that whatever he recommends should be the final word. We have tried following his recommendations to the letter in browser mock-ups to demonstrate the point we want to make. He gets frustrated and confused because it never seems to work like he expected it to... we didn't even want to take the time to do this but we thought it would help. What should we do in this situation? Is there any way to break through? Due to resource constraints we are not in a position to offer any sort of training and I'm not sure that it would take anyway. UPDATE: So he interviewed for a Director level job. It was down to him and some lady from outside the company. He had the connections but she had the education. She is a PhD I think. It turns out this guy doesn't even have a bachelor's degree. Not that he would need it to do what he was doing before but this is a blue chip type company and typically to advance to a Director level position there are standards and requirements that have to be met. So she got the job and the kicker is, after he found out he resigned... someone else said they thought he had a lead at a different company. I don't know and I don't care, he's out of our misery now. :) 

1) Find companies hiring for positions that work near your career job. When I was still in school, I searched for companies that offered positions I'd be interested in after graduation (web developer in my case) and applied for lower, part-time positions that I was qualified for. My hope was that I could perform well while I was there, learn a few things by osmosis that would help with my career, and then apply for career jobs within the company if/when they came available. In my situation, I was able to find a computer repair company that also did web development and was able to secure a part-time job fixing computers. I expressed enough interest in development that management allowed me to take some menial, tedious tasks off of the Web Coordinator's plate. A little staff turnover, a little earned respect, a little luck, and one whole year later I was running their web design department. My point is that it's possible to find companies - especially smaller ones - that are looking for a jack of more than one trade. If you apply for a lesser position that works near the position you'll want after graduation and express interest in making their lives easier, you'd be surprised how much experience you'll walk away with. 2) Start your own projects One of the awesome things about CS is the fact that there's a TON you can do from home with limited equipment and experience. Depending on what your eventual career goals are, you could do something like learn how to write mobile apps and build a few apps that meet some imaginary business needs. You could pretend your favorite fast food chain has asked you to redesign their website and build something you think would really look good. You could get a group of school friends together and work on building a simple video game. Getting friends involved is actually a great way to stay accountable and keep from procrastinating. What you'll end up doing is gaining a crap-ton (that's measurable, look it up) of experience with different technologies and building out a portfolio you can show a potential employer. 

Unethical. Super unethical. While it may pad their stats, what they're actually doing is helping to place workers in jobs that are a bad fit and setting them up for failure. It's unethical for a person to decide to pad their own resume in this way but at least I get it - they're trying to land a job and provide for their family. But when a staffing agency pushes it, it's about greed and nothing else. That's low. What they're doing is trying to fluff their stats so they can say something like, "We place 94% of candidates so if you're looking for a job, choose us!" Or, "98% of the companies that choose us hire a candidate within 2 weeks. Choose us!" Doing so at the expense of both employers and employees is pretty low. These agencies should be helping to find jobs that are a good fit for both the employee and the employer. That's their whole function. When they fail to do this, it hurts everyone involved.
