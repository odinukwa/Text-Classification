No, 5000 calories a day is almost as bad as eating 500 calories a day. At your age, you should be eating a little more calories than an average adult if you are exceptionally active but it should be a maximum of 3200 calories, not 5000. 5000 calories may also get you strong, but it will get you fat at the same time, as Alec stated. If you are cutting lots of calories, you will not grow tall. If you are eating about 2500-3000 calories a day, it will benefit you with muscle growth, and you will still grow taller, too, assuming your diet is clean. If you must know, I would say that 5000 calories a day leans closer to "bulking and cutting," than "building size." If people are eating that much and are muscular and shredded, they probably have a career lifting weights or spend all their free time in the gym, one or the other. 

I used to do 200 push ups a day but I have heard that they put a tremendous amount of strain on your wrists so I decided not to do them often anymore. Is this true, or just a myth? 

I have heard multiple times that going to the gym for about 2 hrs.+ each day often, weakens your immune system for a while, and breaks it down for a while. I would like to know if anyone has ideas to prevent this from occurring if I carry my workout through, because I want to work out 2 hours a day, 5 times a week. Any advice? 

A steroid user does make muscle mass gains without working out. However, it wouldn't be as much as it would if they also went to the gym, too. It would be sort of like if a person was to workout but eat poorly, or lack sleep. They might make some gains, but not much. If someone on steroids wants to get insanely jacked, they've got to lift often for long amount of times, too. And roids do help you recover faster. Steroids are just like a supplement, except they give you way more muscle but also give you negative hormonal changes and other negative side effects as well. I would not suggest using them. It's just not worth the amount of problems that come with the muscles they give you. 

Yes, but only to a degree. Chances are about 90-95% that you will not be lifting weights or running marathons when you are 80, sorry. Once you are pretty old like that you probably will be able to walk, swim, bike, golf and stretch for exercise; but not much more. You can also keep a healthy diet so that could benefit you, too. When you are 60-70 you could probably lift lighter weights and maybe run slower so that would be good for you; yes, be worried about fitness, until you pass age 70. Otherwise when you are past age 70 the ability to recover from an injury or even to climb up steps safely are both way more beneficial to you than the ability to bench press 225. 

YES, YOU MUST DO MORE THAN A SINGLE BODY PART A DAY. I would suggest combining chest, shoulders, and triceps together and back and biceps together, 2-3 times a week. Legs can go with either or, and so can abs, but truth about abs is, they're probably already there and crunches and that other cheap stuff you see in movies isn't going to work your abs. In fact, one barbell squat will work your abs more than 150 crunches. Abs will be worked more through squats and deadlifts than that other stuff. 

I personally would not recommend wrist curls, which work lower arms, but I know that chin ups, pull ups, bicep curls, and even simply grasping dumbbells will build forearm muscles. 

You could probably achieve them by doing machine shoulder press, dumbbell shoulder press, barbell military press, side lateral raises, front raises, and decline flies 3 times a week for 2 years to really get them with a "cannonball" appearance. 

There are two different answers to your question. For the friends that are saying they stayed awake for 30 days without a break for sleep, these friends are obviously pulling your leg. To make things more clear, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY AWAKE FOR 30 DAYS STRAIGHT WITHOUT DYING, so if your friends are presumably "alive," then they were lying. I should also note that the World Record for most days without sleep tolls to be about 11. If somebody went past 2 or 3 weeks without sleeping, they would die. Common side effects of lack of sleep persisting more than a single day can be hallucinations, confusion, blurred vision, immune system shutting down(I don't believe it is for good, though, as with the other things), slurred speech, in other words, the person who was lacking proper sleep would experience close symptoms to that of a person who was drunk. Secondly, the friend who says he sleeps about 2 hours daily could in theory be doing this, but he would eventually die of a heart attack after about 10 years of this so I advise you suggest to him that he add about 5-7 extra hours of sleep onto his current level so he totals with about 7-9 hours daily. If your friend is sleeping 2 hours daily though, he probably would currently be a very crabby person and also show symptoms of exhaustion and confusion constantly, assuming he has been doing this for over 4 or 5 days. He would also have black or purple rings under his eyes. 

I don't expect anyone to have read what I just wrote, it got much longer than I wanted, and I can totally understand if you don't feel like taking the time to read all this. I'm very grateful for anyone that is willing to help here, since I feel very alone on this and overwhelmed right now, because it does cause me quite a bit of stress I have to admit. Thank you! 

Now the question and the Issues: How can I recover my metabolism without getting fat again? So I can smartly set up an approach to get to a healthy bodyfat. My goal is clearly to get to a healthy bodyfat, but as of right now, my hunger still seems elevated, and I have to honestly say, this is really overwhelming and scary to me. I has GREATLY improved in the last 2 weeks, I have better well-being, not cold all the time, actually feel like I'm alive and I don't have the urge to have anything like those 10,000 calorie binges anymore, BUT at the same time, I was in a surplus of around 14,000 calories in the last 2 weeks. I'm far from 'recovered' I think, but gained noticeable fat. Was at 78kg 4 weeks ago, now at around 82kg, water was gained too, but fat also, no doubt. I'm afraid I will have to get more fat to recover properly, but this thought does seem not right to me, since I'm already at a unhealthy bodyfat and I frankly don't want to get fatter, since that can't be good (physiological and of coursy psychological too) So, I was thinking to recover my hormones to a healthy baseline and then continue to diet, this time smartly, with a very small deficit, refeeds, breaks etc. I count calories too, have been doing so for the last 3 years almost. Lifting for around 1 year now. How would you guys go into this? What do you think about my case? 

Sorry for the weird title, I could not find a better way to phrase it. Also not the best in english, but I will try my best. About me: 23 years old Male 178~ cm 82kg 20%+ bodyfat Just a quick history about me, since that will be very relevant to my question, I will make it quick as possible, I promise: -Overweight from childhood until age 16, where I was at 120kg -Lost 50kg from age 16 to 17, via horrible starvation (literally eating around 300-500 calories, almost no protein) -Could not maintain of course, but wanted to get leaner -Continued to try so with the extreme approach, having no idea of anything. Ended up binge eating and getting psychological issues because of it. -Cared about nothing and went full 'self destruction' mode -Went from 70kg to 140kg from age 17-19, mostly started with creating the habit to binge (by dieting that extreme) + psychological feeling completely defeated -Stayed at that weigh from age 19 to age 20 -Realized that this was no way to live, went with an extreme diet again from age 21 to age 22, all was going well until I hit around 90kg -There the extreme approach was just not working again and I developed binge eating once again, which ended in a horrible cycle of extreme restriction and then binge eating -Still managed to get down to 75kg, by continued extreme dieting. By that time I was using PSMF, so it was more 'smart', still had a lot of binges, but I got down that lean and was reasonably lean (something like 15-17%). I reached the 75kg around 6 months ago. -From there on I could not maintain once again of course and kept on yoyo-dieting, now I'm up to 82kg. 8 weeks ago I upped calories and went with a smaller deficit(500-1000 maybe), still could not really maintain that. Was frustrated and went with PSMF again after 4 weeks at a smaller deficit + overeating. Did that for 2 weeks, realized I just could not do this anymore, and it was getting me nowhere. That was 4 weeks ago. -4 Weeks ago I upped calories to around maintenance, the first 2 weeks I was actually under it I think. For the last 2 weeks, I have been eating several days over maintenance (think 2000-3000 calories over) and some days just around it. I just could not take the hunger anymore. This is going on until today, and I'm afraid I have done some serious damage to my hormones, appetite etc. by my history. I still have the urge to overeat on most days, even though I have been in a 14,000 calorie surplus in the last 2 weeks.
