What time of year are the the dreaded midge's in Scotland at their worst? I've only really been into the Higlands in Winter and I would prefer to avoid the worst time for these if possible. 

I know lots of people that buy second hand gear, especially cams (they're expensive!). I'm pretty sure you'll find there is a good market on ebay, etc for stuff like this. Climbing.com offers some good advice on what to check: Cams 

I often see Kestrel's in the countryside around my house (Hobby & Kestrel). I live outside of the range of hobby's so I don't really see them. But if I did, how do you differentiate between them? They seem very similar birds. They're both small raptors with similar colouring and both "hover". Often I don't carry binoculars (or have my glasses on). Is there any one glaring difference between these two birds that will help me identify one from the other? 

I have a pair of winter /climbing gloves. Each glove has a small loop on the ring finger, top of the glove. Why? What's it for? 

You should attempt to keep the fingers not being trained, loose (not crimped and not clenched). As you suggest you want to put as little undue strain on the ligaments. This isn't going to improve your strength. 

Erm yes and no. With moderate hyperthermia you loose rational judegment and do unrational things, like remove your clothes. But removing your clothes is not a stage of hyperthermia as such. The symptoms of hyperthermia are: 

Now that said different species produce feather of consistently better loft. So back to the actual question... the main difference between a duck and a goose is it's size. This has an advantage in loft because the larger goose produces larger feathers with more clusters and downy fibres: 

This pretty much boils down to access. If you have the right to access the area, the fact that it is a historical site means little. So if there is a footpath you can walk along the footpath. If it's open access area, common land or right to roam then again no issues. If it's owned then you must obey the laws of the land/owner for example many historical sites in the UK are owned by the National Trust, etc One major exception to this rule (in regards to historical areas) is Protection of military war graves 

The first picture is of spinners. you tow them though the water and they spin and sparkle, attracting the attention of predatory fish. Use these where you have good visibility in the water. The different sizes colours will depend on what fish you want to catch. The second set are lures. Again designed to be pulled though the water but slower. these are designed to look like fish swiming. Again good visibility needed for these. The above will only catch fish that are predatory. e.g. Pike 

Neither are aggressive though the false widow is more dangerous (still very unlikely to cause serious damage unless you have a heart condition or something) I'd be interested to know which if any it matches? 

Here's an animated example of how to tie this knot (1 to 6 only) It works like a belay plate (but in reverse) so if you hold your hand close to your leg it will release. Moving it forward locks the slip knot. You can use a munter with two ropes (or one rope in half) or a single rope. Here's a video describing the whole process in detail. 

TL;Dr DWR on sleeping bags is to keep them dry for short periods when they get put on wet grass for a few minutes. Adding DWR to your sleeping bag won't make it waterproof. 

As a shorter climber you need to train for your advantages. So train for power moves. Use your lighter weight and shorter levers to perform dynamic moves. This also has the advantages of allowing you to reach the longer moves that you may struggle with. Most important is technique. A climber with good technique will out climb any climber with worse technique, regardless of physical features. There are lots and lots of examples of brilliant short climbers The legend that is Joe brown was well known as a short powerfully built man. I wouldn't say a shorter climber should train much different to a taller climber. A shorter climber will often simply need a different Beta to a taller climber, i.e. a more dynamic move to reach the holds, different foot positions, etc. I'm a firm believer that the best training is climbing. So stick at it. Try some dynamic jump moves and practice them, use this to help you out of sticky situations. Work on your grip strength (dead hangs, etc.) but I would recommend this to anyone climbing short or tall. 

The other week me and my wife climbed into a Cwm/Corrie/Cirque in the lake district on the side of St Sunday Crag in the UK. I could distinctly hear someone talking. I could basically hear every word. I looked for this person only to realise they we're on the other side of the cwm. I checked my map, they we're about 0.5-1km away! 

Partly as a result of the above I ended up getting into a mindset that I was just being silly and I should just man up and get on with it. again, for me this simply made the matter worse, to the point where the grade I could lead gradually got worse. 

How would I go about taking a compass bearing of a distant peak and then relate this to the information on a standard map? 

The broken strap isn't quite visible on that photo. Here's a similar helmet, see the plastic strap with the dial on it. That's what's broken. Notice it doesn't actually anchor anything in place, the main straps attach to the helmet itself: 

Ok, I know I put stay put (above), but this can only get you so far, at some point your going to need to do something. So do something. Plan what your going to do, work out what your going to hold onto, where your going to put your feet and then do it slowly and deliberately while breathing though the panic. Again, rationalise the situation. 

So you get scared when you climb and get swamped with Adrenaline?! Isn't this why your doing this? for the buzz? The Adrenaline! Turn the negative into a positive. Next time you get scared, try and enjoy it! I know this can be hard but adrenaline can be pretty enjoyable if you learn to deal with the fight or flight response. 

No need to have a choice between trainers and boots any more. You can get good solid approach shoes that are both light and sturdy enough for use in the outdoors 

You will likely adjust the shoulder (not length) and chest strap often, but if you get the others right these shouldn't need to much adjustment at all. Adding and removing clothes alters your bulk so you will normally need to adjust your pack too. Adding and removing weight will also naturally require some adjustment. Try not to fiddle too much though, get it into a good position initially and try and maintain this position. 

Your main concern here is going to be shock loading. Nuts are typically tested to resist static compression load. Any shock is typically adsorbed by the rope and other equipment, so they get the mimimum shock load when/if you fall. If they don't fit well and are loose (or are just passed though a hole and are therefore moving around all over the place) then when/if you fall they will hit the rock and shock load. There is no give in the wire or metal so the full fall factor is concentrated in a very small area. This has the potential to take the equipment past it's limits and therefore break it. Even ignoring the shock loading on the equipment your also going to shock load the rock, this can make it break. Think pulling on a hold vs hitting it with a hammer. Then there's your slings, etc. Depending on the material you are again potentially shock loading them due to the movement in the anchor. All in all, this is likely less secure/safe than a well placed secure nut in a crack and should be avoided. You'd be better off attaching a nylon sling around the "tunnel". Here's some work DMM did on the effect of shock loading on slings to give you an idea of how it can affect a system. 

The above is based on my personal experiences. Different people will react differently to this. You need to find a solution that fits you. A nice story For me the turning point was when I was trad climbing, outdoors. I was leading an easy(ish) pitch but it was harder/more exposed than I'd expected. I found myself balanced on an arete 3-4m above my next placement which (in my head at least) would never hold a fall. I couldn't take a fall here, I had to get my sh*t together or I could hurt myself (in reality I was probably perfectly safe but I'd worked myself into such a state that I felt in real danger). I sat there slowly praying looking for a placement and not finding one, gradually I started to feel better, "hold on this hold is solid, I could hang here one handed for about a minute easy" "Now my legs stopped shaking that foot placement is about the size of my living room" "There's a crack there, why the hell couldn't I see that before?, what's that? a number 10" "Bloody hell I could hang a mini off of that placement" It suddenly occurred to me that indoors I would of just let go and become annoyed at myself. But by sticking it out I'd overcome it. I felt awesome at the top and jumped about like an idiot. My girlfriend didn't understand what the fuss was all about, "That was easy?!" Whenever I feel like I'm loosing it I try and remember this situation and how focused I felt once I'd gotten control of my emotions. 

I've recently gotten into foraging for mushrooms locally and have been happily eating field mushrooms and giant puffballs (these are absolutely delicious if you can find them BTW). I was reading a foraging book the other day and it stated that there is only one truly deadly poisonous mushroom in the UK (The Death cap). All the others may well make you really ill but would be unlikely to kill you, unless you eat them in large quantities. Is this true? 

Another option I can think of is eggs, Take plenty of eggs and you can generally make lot's of types of omelettes and spanish omlettes are particuarly tasty. Provided you get eggs from a supplier where the chickens are vacinated against salmonella (such as the Lion mark in the UK) you can keep them unrefrigerated for quite some time. 

Rockfax have a handy conversion chart this is the generally accepted version though it is (like all climbing grades) subjective. Below are the conversion charts: "Bold" trad routes 

Your moving The horses gait is not linear (it goes up and down as well as moving) Controlling a horse normally involves using reins and your hands. If your shooting a bow you need to learn to steer a horse using your legs. 

This varies slightly from fish to fish (for example gutting a skate is different to gutting a pollock) but for a typical "fish shaped fish" o_O 

This helps with your fall technique but for me it failed to address the issue. I wasn't scared of taking a controlled fall I was scared that I couldn't hold on while clipping, etc. 

This depends on your definition of waterproof. Is it possible to make a sleeping bag totally waterproof? No. Would this be a good idea even if you could? Well again no. You need moisture to escape your sleeping bag or else you'll wake up drenched in sweat in the morning. Can you aid it's water repellency with sprays? A little. Will this top your feet getting wet if your tent breaks? Probably not 

Couple of things to supplement Andrea's answer: Learning to read the route (as already stated) Bouldering indoors has one big thing that makes it easier than outdoors all the holds are bug brightly coloured plastic. At no point do you have to search around to find that crimp or foot placement, it's all been worked out for you. When you boulder outdoors (obviously) there is nothing to tell you where all the holds are. You need to work that out yourself (or get someone to tell you, this is called getting "beta"). Different techniques Also the holds may (depending on rock type) be very different. For example very few indoor walls employ hand jamming as a technique, but a lot of grit stone problems involve pretty much constant hand jamming:
