A sufficiently accurate gyroscope can be used to find true north to some precision by determining the angular rate of change of the unit (The military uses such north-finders for artillery batteries). Using a polarizing filter, the location of the sun can be determined to within several degrees. While this is hardly precision navigation, it's certainly better than nothing, as it allows a rough determination of both latitude and longitude. Of course, a "team of explorers" is not about to create an accurate map of the planet when the planet is always overcast. With no satellite photographs, and large-scale aerial photography unavailable, only local maps can be produced the old-fashioned way, by surveying teams. If the overcast is high enough, some aerial photography may possible, and the science team could set up a series of radio transmitters to provide what is essentially LORAN navigation for the mapping aircraft. 

And this pretty much allows any solution, depending on exactly what you mean by anything. Pick a condition and stick with it. 

It's necessary to divide the discussion into two parts: real battles and literary battles. We'll start with real battles. Other than very small battles (a few dozen or so people) it's essentially impossible to kill everybody on the losing side. Battles are confusing, chaotic events, and spread over a large area. Furthermore, there is typically a wide range of competence among the participants, and a determined, very good combatant (or group of combatants) can generally find a soft spot in the other side. This will allow them to cut their way free. Furthermore, most large military forces contain light, fast units used for reconnaissance, and these scout units are unlikely to take part in the worst of the fighting, and will be well-situated to flee when the battle is lost. Also, unless the winning side has absolute superiority, they will be unable to completely surround the losers to prevent escapees. To do so invites overwhelming local attacks by the surrounded unit, as the surrounded unit takes on one small part of the other side, defeats it with small losses, and then moves on to the next one. This is called defeat in detail. And if one side does have such overwhelming superiority, the other side will probably do its best to avoid battle in the first place. Now, as to unreal battles. Umm. It's hard to figure out where to start. Cartoon battles don't have a whole lot of connection to reality, so it's entirely up to the writer to determine what happens. You do realize this, right? In the case of the links you provided, having survivors provides for story continuity, as the survivors go on to avenge the loss. Plus, of course, if the good guys are all killed off in the first scene it's hard to have the rest of the story. 

Sorry, but what does the one have to do with the other? I assume you mean "technogically advanced". To posit that cultural tolerance of other species (particularly species which are not even remotely related biologically) is required to develop a high technology is naive in the extreme. Even within our own history, the belief that a culture's efforts can be dismissed as doomed to failure because of some feature we don't like has lead to major misjudgements. I give you, for instance, the Russian space effort and the Japanese electronics dominance. In both cases Americans often dismissed their efforts due to cultural judgements, and were shown to be spectacularly wrong. And that's restricting the analysis to humans. The thing about aliens is that they are alien. Their motivations and interactions do not have mimic our own, so there is no reason to accept your basic premises. 

As far as practical goes, the best way is to have a guy sitting next to the door. If he recognizes you, he opens the door. 

Almost certainly not. To begin with, nobody knows exactly where the Death originated or how it got to Europe. Some folk claim to know, but there is no certainty. The current best estimate is that it originated in Central Asia and was carried to Europe via merchant ships and the fleas on rats. As a result, there is no reason to think that there is a readily-identified "Patient Zero" who could be stopped from spreading the disease. Any individual who is identified and taken care of will be replaced by a dozen more. Any ship which is prevented from sailing will be, sooner or later, replaced by another ship carrying the vector. And at this time, everybody had fleas. Even if you could prevent the transmission to Europe for a decade, there would be plenty of carriers waiting in the wings. I suppose that if Todd is willing to set himself up as the New Genghis Khan in, let's say, the late 10th Century, and then embark on a campaign of genocide through Central Asia he might get lucky and wipe out the population which will provide the critical mutation. Maybe not, since it's not clear exactly when the strain emerged, but it was widespread in Asia by about 1300. Of course, many think that the bubonic plague was responsible for the Justinian Plague in Rome in the 6th century (I did indicate that there's not much certainty), so wiping out Rome in the 4th century might be necessary instead. Or maybe all of Italy. 

The most important requirement is a moderately long combination of incubation/asymptomatic infectiousness. I've not run across many descriptions of zombies which would allow one to pilot a jet or a ship across an ocean, so global spread requires travel by the asymptomatic. If the turned zombie only becomes infectious once she is obviously a shambling, rotting, brain-craving revenant, stopping the spread of the condition is likely to be pretty effective. The more victims the condition can infect without being detected, the better it will spread. 

The question of focusing the laser needs some expansion. Aiming, too. First, distances. Since the average distance of Mars from the Sun is 228 million km, and for Earth it's 149 million, at conjunction the distance between the two is 79 million km, and we'll use this as the easiest example - call it X. In order to get a small focus spot (diameter d) for the laser, it will need to be expanded to some larger size D when it is launched, and this will be done with a mirror system. Let's figure a d of 1 meter, although this has problems of its own. What is D? This is determined by the equation $$D = \frac{4 \lambda X}{\pi d}$$ If we assume an NIR laser with a wavelength $\lambda$ of 1 micron ($10^{-6}$ meters) $$D = \frac{4\times 10^{-6} \times 79 \times 10^9}{\pi \times 1} = 100 \text{ km}$$ This may be a bit of a struggle to construct in a few hours, so I'll let you get on with it. If you think it will help, you could try a UV laser with a 100 nm wavelength, and the mirror will only need to be 10 km across. Granted, this will not penetrate the earth's atmosphere well, so you'll need a LOT of power, plus you'll get massive beam distortion, but I'm trying to be helpful. As I mentioned, the small desired spot size has a problem or two. The most obvious is aiming. To hit a spot with an accuracy of 1/2 meter at a range of 79 million km requires a pointing accuracy of $$\theta = \frac{0.5}{79 \times{10^9}}= 6\times 10^{-12}\text{ radians} = 0.0000000034 \text{ degrees}$$ Roughly. The orbital velocity of Earth is about 30 km/sec, while Mars is about 24 km/sec, so at conjunction the difference in velocity is about 6 km/sec. This means that the time of transit of the laser pulse must be (for 1/2 meter accuracy) accurate to $$t = \frac{0.5}{6\times{10^6}} = 83 \text{ nsec}$$ In other words, you will have to point an enormous mirror with extraordinary accuracy AND fire the laser with considerable precision of timing. Good luck. Oh yes, and one more obvious problem. If the two planets are in conjunction, and the speech is being given at night (local time) you're just going to be out of luck with the laser thing. Your target is on the other side of the planet, and unless you think you can drill a very large hole you're out of luck. 

Military T-Rex While you were inconvenient enough to specify "transportation and haulage" in your OP, I can't resist suggesting this for a specialty role - shock assault cavalry. They're certainly big enough to carry a rider, and at a pre-firearms tech level they would be unstoppable against infantry formations, and it wouldn't take many to be decisive. Just the possibility that the other side has them would be enough to justify the expense of having some yourself - sort of like nuclear weapons. Of course, breaking one to saddle would probably be a high-risk operation, but you did say that the humans are good at domestication. 

Rex Kerr's answer is correct, but only part of the story. If the cube is expected to stay black for any length of time, it must incorporate some (mumble/handwavium/nanotechnology). The problem of dust has to be dealt with. Outside of clean rooms, there is always a fairly remarkable amount of dust floating around, much of it silicon dioxide.* This will get trapped on the surface and become visible, degrading the apparent blackness. Apparently, the cube needs active nanotechnology to either swallow dust particles or repel them. Each has its problems. If the cube swallows the particles, what does it do with them? Discretely spit out the day's accumulation when it thinks no one is looking? And if it repels them, how? A sort of cheat might be to claim that only the sides remain dust-free, which would take much less energy/handwaving, while dust which accumulates on the flat top is simply not visible from the ground. If the entire cube is to remain black, the cube must either ingest dust or transport it to the edges and dump it over the side. This will require some very entertaining nanotech. 

A good starting point would be the chromatophores of the cuttlefish which have an amazing range of colors and textures, and can vary at Hz rates. One would assume that sexual displays would form the basis for more abstract forms of communications. 

I like user2448131's idea, but it can be improved. I am assuming that what you say "source of energy" you mean electrical energy. If not, please expand on just what you do mean. So, I'm thinking a version of Ben Franklin's (probably fictional) experiment, in one of two forms. Both involve lifting a copper wire into the path of a thunderstorm. Going with the old traditional route, a kite or series of kites (copper wire is heavy) get launched at the height of the storm. For something with a bit more pizazz, small rockets are used. Each has a drawback. The kite scheme is at the mercy of the winds to get the wire right up into the storm. The rocket idea has a problem that may not be obvious: getting the wire to pay out at high speed without snagging, but it allows launch at just the right time and direction. You could have your protagonist try both approaches: first the kite, then the rockets when the kites don't work, or vice versa. Both approaches do have the problem that you need a bloody thick wire to conduct the current involved without exploding. Also to be considered is that as the wire is being lifted, it must be live - that is, it must be connected to the alien power source.
