In large part, this is going to depend upon the rules in your office and the laws in your area. In the United States, the Family Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, could potentially be in play here. In the State of Washington, the Washington Family Care Act imposes additional rules when it comes to sick leave. Unless you are say going to be out for an extended period of time, because of either a planned or unplanned major medical issue, it's generally accepted most places to call in each and every day you are out sick. If it were me, I would have called in sick each and every day that I was out sick. The means of notification will also vary from one organization and supervisor to the next. Some will insist upon a live human being speaking to another live human being over the phone. Others are fine with voice mail or Email notifications. Increasingly, I see Email notifications as superior as I routinely see instances of people calling in sick, getting voice mail, and the person who gets the voice mail is themselves out of the office--either for sick or other purposes. I personally send an Email to the Team Email Distribution List, which includes both my supervisor and my coworkers. In my view, this provides for the greatest possibility of someone who needs to get hold of me getting the message that I won't be in the office that day. As for what to say, as a Union Shop Steward I tell people to be brief and not go into details. This is especially true with FMLA, but it is serves everyone best if the information is brief. "I am out sick today." "My child is sick today." "My elderly parent is sick today." 

A resume is a marketing document, not a binding legal one. It's best to use whatever name you go by on your resume, as opposed to your full legal name (unless your name is Benjamin Franklin du Pont or Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt). This also goes for LinkedIn, your professional website, and any other professional/marketing documents you have out there. There is ample research on the bias at play when someone reads your resume. You're more likely to get an interview in a western country with an Anglo-western name. Regardless of how difficult it is to pronounce your name, picking an anglicized name to go by is a strategic move. Why wouldn't you give yourself every advantage, especially given that finding a job can be hard enough? Personally, I use a shortened version of my name on my resume. Not because I have a foreign or difficult to pronounce name, but because my full legal name is quite long (around 30 characters) and it looks awkward on the page. Also, nobody calls me Elizabeth (my legal first name) and I would prefer it stay that way. To answer your question: Yes you should absolutely put an anglicized name on your resume if you're applying for jobs in the US. 

As a long-term webdev, I've been on a few search committees and we always valued LOW turnover. Nobody wants to invest 6 months in training someone to last 18 months. We had some good applicants we never even considered because they had never held down a job for more than a few years. If it's a crappy job or you're severely underpaid, then move along, but we thought keeping a job for a while is more an asset: demonstrating stability (especially when young) and employee loyalty (always desirable). 

Looking at the risk/reward ratio, I wouldn't say anything. He's going to be gone soon anyway, likely before any disciplinary action would be taken. I've seen a lot of overhead resentment towards peers who raise complaints, no matter how legitimate. That's wrong but common, and while it would be nice to get justice for this guy, I don't think that's even possible at this point without going out of bounds. Some problems take care of themselves. If he were harming someone then heck yes, do something stat, but he sounds more like an aggravation than a danger. 

When faced with a foolish statement, I often prefer quips and sound bites to well reasoned arguments as most people are neither prepared nor interested in a well reasoned argument when they make a foolish statement. Here are a few to try. "Those who can do. Those who can't teach. Those who can do neither study." "So basically you're out of ideas and pounding the table?" "Well, if that's what they do at then perhaps you should return to ." Throw out a fictional institute of higher learning. Google for names. "You would never have made it at Faber College." Faber College was in "Animal House". If you want a quip that is rooted in a well reasoned argument try, "Argumentum ad verecundiam". It means "Argument from authority", and it is one of many logical fallacies. $URL$ 

Yes post it. If you're not embarrassed by at least some aspects of your code 2 years later, you're probably not progressing your development skills, especially if you're new. While anyone can gussy up a few resume examples, a progression of actual work is much more illustrative. If you put out a "hit", employers will mostly examine the code in that project, not digging around in gists. The other contributions still pad your landing page charts and make you look stronger, so get something up there asap. In ten years, you'll have 10 years of projects to show, but not if you don't get started. Don't post zero-revision throwaway code, but don't obsess over "should I have folded that loop?" or "are these doc field names perfect?". Git is also very handy for you to develop code, not just look good, so don't be shy. 

It is said there are lies, damned lies, and statistics. Most of us have probably heard this clich√©, but I cite it because I think it's important to the conversation. If one got extremely meta, then probably everyone has lied during an interview. If one were asked during an interview, "Why do you want to leave your current position?", the full and completely honest answer might cover five points and take six to eight minutes to answer. Three of the points are considered positive, one is considered neutral, and one is considered negative. You start talking about positive point number one, segue into positive point two, then stop talking. If they press for more info, you raise positive point three. You stop talking, and the interviewer is happy. Because you failed to raise the neutral and the negative point, did you lie? In my view, no. You answered the question to the interviewer's satisfaction, which is what most people want. Most people, sitting on either side of an interview, do not hold Fifth Level Black Belts in Grammarian Jiu Jitsu. Also, most people don't want to hear someone drone on for six to eight minutes answering a question. Now, let's say the interviewer pressed you with a follow up question of, "Thank you for your answer. It's been my experience that no one leaves a job, of their own accord, unless there are some negative aspects to that job. Please talk about the negative reasons why you want to leave your current position." I have at times been asked more probing questions such as, "I feel like there may be other reasons why you're wanting to leave your current position." Coworkers over the years have also had these experiences. At that point, they are asking to hear the neutral and negative reasons, so if you don't share those then you are lying. You said something that caught my attention. You said, "I think he is a level below the required knowledge". There are many adjectives in the English language for levels of expertise. In purely alphabetic order, some of these include: Advanced, Beginner, Experienced, Expert, Intermediate, Newbie, Novice, Proficient, Rookie, Seasoned, Senior, Skilled, Skillful, Talented If a person called herself an Expert, but your definition of Expert is different from hers, then the two of you have a different definition of Expert. However, I would not say that the person lied. If a person said they had five years of experience in a particular technology, but in adding up the months and years they worked with the particular technology, it was really only four years and ten months, did they lie? Technically yes, but how far from the truth were they when they were estimating in their head and concluded they had five years of experience? Conversely, if it was really one year and ten months, then their estimation skills might not be to blame and they were in fact lying. You have to analyze and assess each individual situation and determine what was the real harm or foul. I do not believe it's as simple as you caught them in a lie so terminate them. 

Whether or not your boyfriends boss/coworkers/reports would see this as an acceptable reason for taking time off is irrelevant. PTO (i.e. paid sick, vacation, and/or personal time) is a part of the salary/benefits package and your boyfriend is likely entitled to use his time in whatever way he wishes (depending on local laws, of course), regardless of whether that is taking care of his cat, going to the doctor for his own health, or going to Burning Man. Some companies have policies about using sick time specifically - like needing a doctors note. If that's the case, then it wouldn't be appropriate to use sick time specifically, but instead your boyfriend would need to use vacation or personal time. I'm assuming this is paid sick time and also that there aren't any weird rules about needing a doctors note or anything, because you state it's a full time salaried job and don't mention any applicable rules/policies. Typically people don't ask permission to use their PTO for a specific purpose, they instead clear the date. Usually the exchange goes like this: Hey boss, I'm going to be out of the office on Monday. I don't have any meetings on my calendar or projects due, so let me know if there's anything you can think of that needs to get done before then. If this is short notice (say it's Saturday and your boyfriend needs to take Monday off) he might send his boss an email (or text/call if that's the kind of relationship they have) either early Monday morning or over the weekend and say something like "Hi Boss, I need to use one of my sick (or personal/vacation) days today. Apologies for the short notice." Some people think that making themselves available by email or phone will makes things easier - that might apply to your boyfriend depending on his job. Personally, my office is very accommodating of my dog appointments (although I made it pretty clear while I was interviewing that my pup is #1) and my boss doesn't care if I use vacation, sick, or personal time interchangeably. I imagine, for someone who has a child/pet/other life thing that matters deeply to them, any place worth working will be understanding of the fact that having a pet/child/etc. sometimes means taking time off to care for them. 

There's no compensation due because your company is spending the same amount on you as your colleagues, due to "price changes". Unfortunately, someone made a mistake that delayed your car and by the time you and they got to it, you suffered from a market flux. Life's not fair, but it's not your companies fault. Asking them for compensation would be like "looking a gift horse in the mouth"; almost literally, and even worse: not just looking but complaining. Don't take it personal, stuff happens and you still get a car. 

The literal answer to your question is "yes" because it's unprofessional to do anything your employers don't accept. They get to decide what's "professional" under their roof, and professionals abide by the rules. That said, in the uncritical context described, I think they are full of it. In casual conversation I find it awkward (if not rude) to force a less familiar language on someone. I think you were pragmatic, polite, and welcoming, but it's my luxury of detachment that permits my view; as an employee, you don't get that luxury. 

First, consider what you want to do. Then go talk to your ex-boss one on one and face to face, and be honest with him. Don't think of it so much as loyalty as it is maintaining, fostering, and growing a business relationship. This person thought enough of you that he found you a job before shutting down the company. This tells me that he sees something of value in you. He has the potential to be of value to you, so don't throw that away. Start the conversation with something like this. 

Always play it by ear, but be prepared to pay. If they are paying, which is the norm, let them. Don't fight it. Several times, I've had a company buy me lunch, dinner, plane ticket and hotel room to come out for an interview, and the like. Only time I've ever had to pay my own was with the rental of a vehicle, which I believe is connected to the liability insurance risk. They reserved it, but I had to use my own credit card to pay for it and then get reimbursed. Even when the company is paying, you should still consider being reserved. It's an opportunity for them to see if you are frugal or extravagant. Whether you will have the ability or authority to approve spending decisions or not, you might be tasked with reviewing a product or software and it's better to be seen as frugal than extravagant with the company's money. While you don't have to order the absolute cheapest item on the menu, do NOT order the most expensive item on the menu. Generally the company will be very upfront about it. "Order whatever you like. The company is paying." I once was told almost these exact words. The executive then went on to praise the blah-blah-blah on their menu. It was a median priced item, it was what he ordered, so it was what I ordered. Subtle directions like that should be followed, unless it's something you are allergic to or you really do not like. It may sound simplistic, but it's an easy way to plant a brief message in their mind. "Frankie likes the Club Sandwich, so he must be a good guy." If you are one of the final candidates, a hiring decision can be swayed by such nuances. If you get no such directions, choose wisely in terms of how easy the item is to eat. BBQ ribs have a high potential for making a mess of you and your clothes. If it's a BBQ place, maybe order a pulled pork sandwich. 

I'll be honest with you: college has never been more expensive or less impressive. As so many folks have degrees, degrees don't advance you as far as they did a generation ago. But, at the same time, having a college degree has never been more important to getting a good job, especially in the field of software development. I left college with 12 credit hours to go, all electives. At that point, even though I was a javascript ninja, I would not even be considered for either of the two sweet professional web developer gigs I've had since. It wasn't that those last 12 hours really made me a good webdev, it was a silly piece of paper all the good jobs wanted that I couldn't produce, but that's how it was/is. A less skilled buddy of mine with a CS degree landed a real job about that time. I went back to school after standing over pizza ovens for a year, scribbling code on the back of takeout menus while the boss wasn't looking/barking. You don't want to mess with all that, and besides, college is a ton of fun anyway... If dead-set on not getting a bachelors: I would get an associates at least, so that workplaces know I can program. Try to make sure most of the credits will transfer to a 4-year in case you change your mind later like I did. Code bootcamps and certifications are meaningless for devs. Internships and volunteer work can get you in the door someplace. It's possible to make it in dev without college, it's just a lot more difficult and less likely. You will have to have a killer portfolio and work history (chicken and egg) and you will need to be lucky enough to meet someone who "takes a chance" on you, which is no guarantee. You don't need to go to college right after school, and for a lot of smart kids, I don't recommend it because it feels like a waste of time, so you won't try hard. You're young, and will be young for 5 years, enjoy your youth. Try it your way, and see if you're one of the lucky ones, and if not, being a 21 year old freshman has its benefits... 

In a word, don't. There is a crude cliche, which I'll clean up for the forum. "Don't eat where you poop." Most romantic relationships fail, and as such if you were to become involved romantically then statistically you would break up thereby creating an even more uncomfortable situation at work. If this were outside of work, I would still say don't. You describe this person in negative ways--holier than thou, indifferent to you, makes you angry. These are not the makings of a healthy relationship. Don't. 

It sounds as though the other freelancer was adhering to a principle that can be encapsulated with the phrase, "Here's your piece of 'junk', ma'am/sir." Over the years, I've been in this situation more than once. I'm writing junk that should be thrown away. I know it, the client knows it, and we each know what the other knows. There are at least three explanations for it. 1) Sometimes it is cheaper to just "keep the wheels on" something that has a known, short, life expectancy--keep the TPS Reporting System alive until it's replacement arrives later this year. 2) Other times, a dysfunctional system is the elephant in the room that everyone sees yet no one is supposed to acknowledge or speak of openly, so don't. 3) Almost every system has some dysfunction. Occasionally, the level of dysfunctional is not widely known by management, and addressing the dysfunction is a first step towards resolving the dysfunction. Because the messenger is often the one shot, speaking up and addressing the dysfunction can be brave or foolhardy, depending upon the outcome. Under #3, it's brave. Under #2, it's foolhardy. On the specific question you ask in the subject line, I would say it depends, but mostly No. It is possible to address dysfunction within an IT system without laying blame on anyone doing the work, past or present. Laying blame opens up the possibility that the person who was responsible is held in high regard by Management and other Stakeholders, whether it is deserved or not. Even if the person or persons you blame are no longer with the organization, or are not held in high regard, others may have been involved in decisions that led to implementing the dysfunction, so you are indirectly blaming them. Why engage in a fight you don't need to? Just document the dysfunction without assigning blame. Neither the problem nor the solution needs to depend upon any specific human being. If you refrain from naming or blaming human beings in the discussion, then it increases the chance for logic and reason to prevail.
