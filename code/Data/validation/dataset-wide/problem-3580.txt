I can't speak from personal experience, still being a bit on the scrawny side and only recently having started the program, but You Are Your Own Gym by Mark Lauren comes with a fair amount of recommendations and you can see from his build that it apparently works. He includes both exercise programs and suggestions for diet in the book. There are apparently also apps and videos that he markets. 

It's really difficult to say whether the readouts are accurate without reference to the specific readouts and the bike model. However, a few notes: Different muscles are used Bicycling primarily targets the glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps, shins and calves. Stationary bicycles put more strain on your hamstrings due to the need to exert muscular effort to slow the flywheel. There's also less variation of muscles used since you're not turning and you're not dealing with going up and down inclines. That said, you're only going to be seeing significant gains there if you're doing heavy activity, which frankly most people aren't on either an indoor or outdoor bike. It's easier to "coast" with an exercise bike I think we've all experienced this, getting to a particular speed and the flywheel is pushing your feet almost as much as you're pushing the pedals. Compare that to biking outdoors where, unless you're on a decline, you have to keep putting effort into the system to keep it moving. Distance traveled and speed tend to be accurate, but calories burned may not be Speed and distance are essentially a function of rotational speed of the wheel and its diameter. So yes, outside of flywheel coasting, the speed at which you're turning the pedals probably does work out to that speed, and maintaining that speed for a given time will model the distance. Calories are more tricky. First of all, they're generally based on a formula that combines your height, weight, and age, so it's an estimate from the start. Secondly, most exercise machines don't subtract resting metabolic rate, so the figures look slightly more impressive than they are. You burn about 130 calories per hour just sitting at your desk, 180 per hour if standing. A moderate pace on the bike burns about 490 calories per hour. The machines will be indicating the highest figure they can, generally including a chunk of your resting rate. That said, it's not that uncommon for "calories burned" to be listed that way in general, so the machines aren't terribly deceptive there. 

I've had good luck with the Iron Gym Pull Up bar. It does require a standard-size door with a reasonably secure/level lintel and a few inches room on either side (much to my chagrin, I only have one door in the house where this applies, a bathroom). It costs about $25-30 in stores, but they show up fairly often on Freecycle for free, or on Craigslist for $5 or so. It doesn't look like it should hold you up, but it does do the job. Before that, I alternated using a support I-beam in my basement (the lack of a good grip was an issue there, although it probably did good things for building up finger strength) and heading down the block to the playground (not bad, but it's outdoors, and the little kids look at you funny). 

While I have not had this experience, this paper on olfactory hallucinations does note physical exertion as a common trigger. 

From the sound of it, you're trying to stretch your hamstrings. The sensation you're describing sounds like a classic case of the leg "falling asleep" due to either restricted blood flow or a pinched nerve. It's not dangerous, just annoying. Poking around a few forums, the consensus I've found seems to be that the most likely case is that the way in which your stretching is probably pinching a nerve, likely from your pelvis pressing into the top of the leg. The recommended fix is to keep doing the stretch until it goes away. Incidentally, the pelvic position that I've seen described for a front-leg stretch onto a table is "neutral", not tilted forward, back, left, or right. 

Overall, I'd say that 3-4 cups of coffee isn't really going to break the bank either way. If it keeps you moving to perform more exercise, that's good. If the caffeine is disrupting your sleep habits, that's bad. The creamer is less than 10 calories per teaspoon, so 3-4 cups will neither result in massive weight gain or much extra fuel for muscle-building. It's pretty much a wash. 

Feeling tired and nauseated after a workout is normal, especially if you've been pushing yourself. You've likely burned through a lot of energy reserves, and your adrenaline will be crashing. If it happens every time, even after light workouts, I'd recommend seeing a doctor, just in case there's something wrong, maybe an endocrine issue. As regards the nausea, after a very intensive workout, your body has been routing blood to the more important exercising bits, so your stomach will be a bit queasy for a time. It's natural. 

As regards heart attacks, entering cold water can cause a heart attack or lead to accidental inhalation, but it's a rare occurrence which has nothing to do with eating. 

When I was a child, I had no problem with going across the monkey bars. Sure, my hands were usually sore afterwards (as much as anything because the outside bars had a tendency to oxidize and form deposits along their surface), but I could do it. I recently tried, just to show my nephews it could be done, and I made my way across, but my shoulders and upper arms were in a great deal of pain afterwards. I know that, to get better, I probably just need to keep doing it, but I'm also 35, so I'm well aware of how easy it can be to injure oneself, and shoulders are notoriously easy to damage. Eventually, in an ideal world, I'd like to work up to being able to do swings and laches, but that's in the future, of course. So, is there any good progression or exercise for me to follow? Should I start with just hanging for longer periods of time or am I best off going right into going hand-over-hand? As a further update, bolstered by the advice that I wouldn't sustain lasting damage most likely, I went ahead and hit the playground. Doing the monkey bars is difficult, but I can manage it. My shoulders and elbows ached a bit afterwards, but it was manageable. The worse part, at this point, is my hands start hurting quickly, but calluses will no doubt improve that. 

Short answer, it depends on what you're optimizing for and what you've trained for. The general wisdom is that 80-90 rpm is ideal for reduction of muscular fatigue and 80-100 rpm (possibly as low as 60 rpm) is best for ideal oxygen usage. But those are values for trained cyclists. More recreational cyclists have been found to have the longest cycling time around 50 rpm. Basically, the faster your cadence, the better the blood flow, but the more that you have to actively "push" to keep pedaling at that speed, creating a tradeoff. 

Heh. I usually have trouble with excessive sweating when running too, although apparently not quite to the same level. I personally wring my clothes out if they're too soaked in sweat, then lay them out flat on my car's dashboard, but that's also because I'm usually running at a destination, such as before theater practice starts. As for being hot and sticky afterwards, a quick rinse in the shower does do wonders. While you're showering, the sink makes a fine place to stick the clothing, then you can move it back afterwards. 

For weight loss, your first culprit will be your diet, specifically calorie intake. Exercise is good for your health, and there's evidence that it allows to be healthy eating a wider variety of foods, but unless you're training for hours each day, you're better off looking at what you're eating and how much. I would bet that if you noted down everything that you ate or drank (including alcohol) for the space of a week, you'd be surprised at how much food you didn't even acknowledge eating. Snacks add up, and it's been estimated that most weight gain happens over holidays and weekends when you're not paying as much attention. If you're more concerned about your inability to get back into exercise, as your second paragraph seems to indicate you're having trouble even starting, consider whether your expectations are set on your past performance rather than your current ones. Don't worry too much about how long you can run, or how much weight you can lift. Look at doing something of moderate intensity at least three times a week for about 20 minutes. Depending on your fitness level, this could be as easy as taking a brisk walk around the neighborhood, particularly if stairs and hills are involved. Aim to have an elevated heartbeat, but to keep yourself from breathing so heavily that you can't talk. You could go for more exercise, or more intensive exercise, but frankly, it's far too common for people to push themselves too hard and to quiet as a result. If you can't get out to exercise, then calisthenics such as pushups, pullups, dips, and just doing silly little things like hopping in place aren't a bad way to get your metabolism up. Most importantly, when it comes to diet and exercise, don't try to be a saint. Without small indulgences (which you will note down in your log of food), you're never going to keep to a diet for more than a few months. And if you're not enjoying your form of exercise, you're not likely to keep to it in the long run. Find foods that you don't have to choke down and vary your exercise routine whenever it gets boring or feels too onerous. Good luck! And be realistic about your goals. Sustainable weight loss tends to be at the 1-2 pound per week level for most people, and your weight will fluctuate a bit over the course of that week depending on what you eat and drink. 

After that, it's basically practice and listening to your body as to where you are on or off balance. 

Late to the party, but as per James's answer, there's a good chance this is tied to your tendons. You may have some variety of golfer's elbow. You mention that you were using dumbbells. One of the easy ways to inflame that tendon is putting it under stress while gripping something tightly, especially if you curl your wrist. Which, as you might guess, is pretty much a description of how many people do bicep curls initially, tightly gripping the dumbbell and curling their wrist as they left the weight and put strain on the tendon. I've been there before, right down to the arm largely feeling OK, but being unable to straighten my arm. It does pass within a few days. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory and pain medication will make your life more bearable. 

I don't believe that there is a universal list of stretches, but there are certainly guides out there. I'm personally fond of Craig Ramsay's Anatomy of Stretching which has both an hour-long comprehensive set of stretches and a 15 minute essentials one, the latter of which also comes on a poster that comes with the book. I attempted to scan in his quick stretches now that I finally got the book from the library, but my scanner is acting up. Hopefully, this is enough that you can get the gist of it: 

As far as I know, there's no logic behind that belief. Historically speaking, some preservatives have since been proven to have potential negative effects. We no longer pack our meat in cakes of salt. We know that burning the outside of the meat preserves it, but also produces carcinogens. And, of course, we now know that packaging our food inside lead containers has certain negative effects. That said, modern preservatives are consistently safe and the mechanics that make food preservatives work (retardation of bacteria and fungal growth) have nothing to do with the process of "burning" fat. 

The evidence is equivocal. It would not seem to be a good match for calorie burn. An hour of yoga burns approximately 150 calories in an hour, less than half of the 300 calories that would be burned in an equivalent 3 MPH walk in the same hour. However, one 2005 study showed a correlation between yoga and weight loss. The study consisted of surveys, which I always find a bit suspect, as people tend to be notoriously bad at tracking themselves, and claims to have outruled confounding factors, but the article I linked doesn't elaborate on what they did to do so. The mechanism via which it might help someone lose weight ranges from woo-ish answers such as the yoga "supercharging" the body with ki to more practical answers such as that practicing yoga, especially in places filled with skinny people in skintight outfits, may motivate some to keep at it, or to quit if they're not the sort to easily lose weight in general. Somewhere in the middle is that yoga, when practiced properly, involves a lot of body consciousness, which may result in people being more aware of bad habits like overeating, or sitting around too long. Another possibility is the tie that exercise has with diet. It has been shown that regular exercise reduces some of the negative effects of a bad diet even if you're not burning as many calories as you're taking in. From that perspective, even if yoga isn't actually forcing you to expend many calories, it is making you work a bit, which signals the body to be more efficient. But it would also imply that any consistent exercise would be doing the same. Nevertheless, if yoga is something you can stick with, that makes it superior to a more intensive workout that provides better fitness benefits but is not something you can stick with. 

If you believe what they're saying, there are benefits. Certainly, massage has been shown to help relieve cramping and inflammation. The above-linked research sounds a bit more sketchy with junk science like "switching on genes", so I'm more than a tad skeptical. Similarly, anyone claiming that massage "flushes out toxins" or starts nattering on about "chi meridians" or "reiki" is essentially selling snake oil. If the snake oil helps, that's good, but don't mistake it for science. A contrasting study found no benefits other than increased relaxation. 

Simply enough, you've been three years out of the game, you're carrying more weight, and squats are more difficult than most people give credence. The first thing you need to do is to rest long enough to be able to move without pain. You overdid it this time. You need to start with a lesser amount, and gauge results from there. There are any number of "X reps of this exercise in six weeks" programs available online. Here is one for squats. It's nothing terribly scientific, but it produces a guide for how many squats to do in each set. I got up to 30-40 in each set, 4 sets a night, when I last did it, before I got bored and moved on to something else. The other thing that you may want to watch out for is overriding your body's natural signals via willpower. Some people are better at powering through discomfort and pain than others. I'm one of those myself. It's an issue because it means I'm prone to winding up unable to continue a program a few days later. If you find that you're prone to that sort of thing, intentionally pick a lower goal and work from there. It will mean that the first week or two will probably seem like you're doing nothing, but what you're doing is conditioning your body to the movement, getting it prepped. By the time it gets difficult, you will be significantly less likely to actually hurt yourself to the point where you can't get up in the morning.
