This incentive to explore and conquer the Americas would apply even better to Europe, Africa, and Asia. So why wouldn't they conquer those places first? And once they did that, the Americas can be reached by exploring land that can be seen across the sea. They wouldn't have needed to make a long sea voyage. All that assumes that these Romans would be better conquerors. In the real world, Rome was unable to conquer all of Great Britain and never reached Scandinavia. It doesn't appear to have gone for sub-Saharan Africa nor that far into Asia. It never attempted any long range sea expeditions because it didn't need to do so. It reached its maximum extent with just the Mediterranean and some trips by land. This is conceivable, but it is such an unlikely series of events. First, they have to send an expedition across an ocean despite it being well known that sailing out of sight of land was often deadly. Then they'd have to actually succeed in the journey. Then they'd have to stay alive and resupply in the Americas. Then they'd have to make their way back, which is harder. The currents and trade winds make it easier to go west than east. All those things are less likely than not. Or they could just explore in more normal ways. They knew about Europe, Africa, and Asia. Why not conquer those places? Even if you gave them some explore and conquer imperative, why would that send them west across the ocean rather than south, north, and east? Even a religious imperative wouldn't explain why they wouldn't do the easier, incremental explorations first. 

You might be better off starting with a goat rather than a horse. There certainly have been single-horned goats. Breed them until you find some that breed true. This would also explain why the unicorn has goat hooves. And it allows the unicorn to be developed with simple breeding rather than genetic engineering. You might have some extra work to make the unicorn large enough to ride. I.e. you might need to breed multiple generations to concentrate on size, strength, and speed to make them more horse-like. Sorry, no solution for making the one-horned goat prefer virgin riders. 

Because it is more efficient for it to be immoral than for it to require guarding against. Consider how our society would be different if you had to guard against not just rare stealing but common. You'd have to keep most of your valuables with you. It would be difficult for a company to make improvements -- other companies would just steal them. They'd have to have far more than just a single night guard watching some television screens. All this would create a drag on the economy. It would be more difficult to innovate, as the benefits from innovation would be less. It would be hard to make a technological society this way. Society would probably be more like that of the plains tribes. 

But replication credits only give you replicable items. So given empty land, I can build a mansion. But without the empty land, I have nowhere to site my mansion. So along with replication credits, you still need real currency to get land, etc. You would get a job to purchase things that can't be replicated practically. Or access to such things. Jobs would primarily be scientific and engineering. Given the design for a new robot, you could replicate it. But who would design it? And who programs it afterwards? Those design and programming jobs would be where the money would go. And most people would want to learn how to do that. Because even if you don't do it for others for pay, you want to be able to design and program a robot of your own. 

These are all more plot-based than I'd like for this venue, but that's somewhat of a characteristic of the problem. 

There isn't a great solution to force having just one descendant from a Worldbuilding perspective. But there are a couple other things that you could do. 

This seems like a separate question. But just a quick comment: Females move from family to family in human society. How does that affect property rights there? 

The rule is stated bad money drives out good. So if you have one form of a money that is more valuable than another, people will tend to trade the less valuable money (gold) and hoard the more valuable money (food). In this case, they will also eat it. And farmers will grow more. This would persist until food became abundant again. In the circumstances that you describe, food would be very valuable. People would accept it in trade. It would be possible to create a currency based on promises of food. So you could go to an approved store and exchange your currency note for a day's food in some staple form (e.g. a bag of flour). There would be some challenges though. If farms produce an abundant crop next year, there will be inflation. Other goods will be worth more of the currency (i.e. prices will go up). If there is a problem growing food (bad weather, pests, disease, etc.), there will be deflation. Other goods will be worth less of the currency (prices will fall). The government would have to store food to make this credible. But since food has a limited shelf life, this means that they will have to constantly replenish this storage. Releasing food in the spring. Throwing away food in the summer (perhaps feed it to cows or pigs). Buying food in the fall. A normal year should have a surplus. An exceptional year should have a big surplus. A bad year should just make ends meet. 

I ran some simulations (code and assumptions at the bottom). I found a slight preference for hermaphroditic offspring overall but a stable one. So perhaps 56-57% hermaphrodite and evenly distributed between the other two. Note that it is possible to favor males over females or vice versa. For example, a rule that hermaphrodites and females only breed with males (possibly allowing males with multiple spouses) would eliminate females and keep females eliminated so long as it was followed. This was based purely on those rules. If you have different rules, then you're going to get different results. It might be better to approach the problem from the other direction. How would you like to split the genders and why? Some splits may not have an easy explanation. Alternatives I read a book a while ago where gender was determined by the gender ratio around the child. So all children were neuters. The move to adulthood occurred when the child would develop a gender. A child surrounded by females would become male. A child surrounded by males would become female. You could extend that to include hermaphrodites (surrounded by equal numbers of males and females). And you could provide arbitrary rules for the development of children surrounded by hermaphrodites. That society could choose its gender ratio if it wanted. We often act like males and females are perfectly evenly divided in humans. But actually Y sperm are more likely to form. This is partially offset as Y sperm are less likely to succeed to fertilization. But overall, there are more boy babies than girl babies. Boys/men are also more fragile, dying in accidents more often. With modern medicine, women seldom die due to pregnancy. So by retirement age, there are more women than men. Anyway, you can use similar mechanisms to alter ratios in your humanoids. Perhaps there is some birth defect that is common in one gender or another that leads to miscarriage. Perhaps hermaphrodites produce less sperm. Perhaps the genetics is more complicated. Simulation code GenderSimulator.java 

This is not anti-gravity or magnetic, but it is wheelless and does not touch the ground. Why not make these into flying cars? Mostly because they are horrid in fuel mileage compared to something with wheels or even wings. They are only competitive with helicopters. The primary use of hovercraft in the real world is for use over surfaces into which ground vehicles would sink but which don't have a consistent enough depth for water vehicles. They can handle water and land as well as shallows and swamps. This flexibility gives them an advantage over boats and cars. Unlike winged vehicles, they can pause and stay in one place. They are cheaper to operate than helicopters, and they have a higher weight capacity for the space they take than helicopters. The latter reason is why marines use them for water to land attacks. The former reason is why emergency crews use them--in floods for example. Why might your characters use them? If energy is cheap enough in your world, perhaps the fuel mileage costs don't matter. If energy is cheap enough, you can even do without the skirts. There are hovercraft that can go as high as fifty feet. The skirts do make it easier for people to walk close to the hovercraft, as they reduce the airflow needed to stay off the ground. 

We can guess that humans originally had a diet similar to that of apes and monkeys: grubs, fruits, and small climbing creatures. But I doubt that the grubs and small climbing creatures sound terribly appetizing to you. We can eat them (and in remote areas, people still do), but we do not normally find those preferable to farmed food. Another point regarding this: cats don't eat mouse-flavored cat food. They eat tuna and chicken flavored food. They also like milk and cream, although it is no more natural to adult cats than to humans. Their preferred foods are not those natural to them but superior versions that they only get from humans. My basic point here is that you shouldn't necessarily use the diet of wild badgers to determine what intelligent badgers might prefer to eat. Many animals prefer human food--they just have no way to make it. Comparative advantage It's also worth noting that even if badgers can build something, they may not. Trade occurs when it's easier to do the work you know and trade it for the results of work that you do less well. Note that even if the badgers are better than humans at producing everything that they want, they may still trade if the humans value the badger product enough to make the human product comparatively cheaper. For example, if the ore is only available from the badgers, the humans may be willing to trade a lot for it. Also look for absolute advantage. For example, humans raise and eat birds. Birds may not like living in burrows. Therefore, badgers may not have their own birds, so they can only get feathers from wild birds. So if badgers find feather pillows and mattresses superior to their natural alternatives, they might be interested in trading for them. 

Make a hole in it. Once there is water flow, the hole will expand. If the hole is low in the dam, the structure above it will collapse. But even if at the top of the dam, it will work its way down over time. You might ask if dams don't already let water through. Sure, this is called a spillway. But spillways receive extra reinforcement so as not to compromise the overall structure. In other words, they are deliberately designed not to wear when water runs through them. If you choose a random portion of the dam (or the ground beside the dam), it won't have that reinforcement. The hole will expand. Making the hole can be as simple as using a pick and shovel. Dams were often simply big earthworks then. You could dig through them. A dam made of mortared stone would be more difficult. You might find it easier to dig near the dam. That would often still be regular earth. The dam might also be buttressed. Then you could remove the buttress by digging around it and removing its support. A buttress near the center of the dam will likely cause the most strain when removed. Note that the water is part of the dam's support. As you remove the water and relieve the pressure, the dam may collapse into the water. This is the shock and awe moment, when a small breech turns into total collapse. This is most likely with a buttressed dam. The reason to do this rather than undermine the dam is that undermining requires more digging. Not only do you have to dig through the thickest part of the dam, but you also have to dig down to get there. And with a dam, it's unlikely that you'd be dodging defenders. Unlike a wall, where defenders stand on top and throw things at you. So there's less utility in starting a tunnel away from the wall. Most dam construction in Roman times will be such that it is as easy to dig through the dam as under it. If a mortared stone dam, look to removing its support. This may be easier on the sides than underneath. Let the water do the hard work. You just need to give it a chance to start. I would only see undermining as necessary with a buttress, which is smaller. 

What do you need? If the answer is food and shelter, buy a farm in your new country. Try to get there before everything collapses. If the answer is something that travels well, buy jewelry. But expect it to fall in value. You won't be able to trade it for five million dollars worth of food. People who aren't traveling will be able to provide more valuable things (e.g. your barrels of oil), because they can store in bulk. Something of a compromise answer would be a solar-powered sailboat with fishing gear. If you want to travel a distance, you can use the sail. You can catch food with the fishing gear and trade your surplus for other goods. You can also trade electricity (at least if the sun is shining) or transport. The boat also provides more storage, so you can store more bulk. Also consider adding weapons for when someone tries to steal your boat. If you don't know anything about sailing or boating in general, you might have to hire people to join you. They provide expertise while you provide the funds. All this assumes that the world economy really collapses. Not just a recession or even a depression. A collapse. Anything short of world collapse, just find somewhere that is not collapsing and convert to their currency. Money is going to trade better than goods unless things are so bad that money is no more than colored pieces of paper. Money is good because it provides a variety of goods. Without money, you want to collect a variety of goods. 

Heinlein had a product called a Shipstone in the book Friday. I believe that they were solar-charged batteries. The questions you're asking here remind me of the issues with which he was dealing. In his book, Shipstones had kicked off a small nuclear war. Heinlein also believed that corporations would engage in assassination of their enemies though. If Sony has the North Korea guy whacked, then you'll know Heinlein was on the right track. Anyway, if there was a truly revolutionary, non-polluting energy source, most countries would end up embracing it. Certain countries might try to restrict them, but the problem is that it's the producers who want to restrict it. The consumers would prefer it. Consider how much pressure there is to switch from fossil fuels, which are the cheapest form of energy now, to renewables. If we had a sudden new source of cheap, non-polluting energy, there's no way that countries like Japan and Germany wouldn't embrace it. The US is more difficult, as it is both a producer and a consumer of fossil fuels. In the long run though, I'd expect cheaper to win. If the device is easy to build in a garage, then I don't see how countries could really stop it even if they wanted. What are they going to do, arrest people for canceling their electric bill? The easiest way to keep these devices out of the hands of everyday people is to supply cheap energy so as to make it unnecessary for people to build their own devices. So my prediction is that these devices would be embraced in safer ways. People would be discouraged from owning their own, but utilities would use them to replace existing power plants. Over time, more and more places would have them. If they could find a safe way to make devices slag themselves without exploding, they could make devices more generally available. For example, electric cars could be powered by their own device. If someone tried to use the positive feedback trick, the device would short out and then make itself nonoperational. If someone tried to unseal the device, the same thing.
