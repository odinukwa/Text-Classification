I believe there are significant differences between the Hindu notion of Brhman and Dharmakaya based on reading the responses of Buddhists from tibet and east asia, as well as direct questioning of tibetan monk and a Sri Lankan buddhist who studied Mahayana buddhsim. I also think many of these differences can be seen in the fourth chapter of the complete translation of the tibetan work known to the west as the tibetan book of the dead. This chapter discusses the ultimate nature of mind and is an intoduction to the teachings on how the intermediate states between death and the taking on of a new birth can potentially be used the acheive enlightenment. It is a good read if you have a good translation. In it you will see the ultimate nature of mind being desribed in ways that Brahman is never described. For example, the Hindu Vedanta School describes Brahman "one without a second." In the fourth chapter of the translation of the book of the dead describes the ultimate nature of mind as free from the extremes of unity and multiplicity. Other important differnces include the fact that some tibetans atleast do not accept the dharmakaya as a subtratum which is the ontological reality upon which the illusion of the world rests. That is how Vedanta understands the relationship between Brahman and the world we experience. In contrast, the buddhist view is that the world illusion is a creation of the unelightened mind which imputes a solid reality to things which are infact empty. This is true for mind-only viewpoints as well as madhymaka traditions. In Hinduism there is an ontological reality outside of our mind which we, in out ignorance, misread as a collection of discrete, finite, objects. In buddhsim, the idea is there is no truely existent extra mental ontological reality upon which we project the appearance of a universe of finite objects. Instead, we either impute an ultimate reality onto a complex network of causes and conditions which are constantly in flux, or in the mind-only traditions we are exerienceing creations of our own mind which are "internally" generated. Again, in contrast the Hindu notion is one of misreading the true nature of extramental, infinite and truely existent reality. Another difference between the two notions is that Hindu view is almost fanatical about there being only one unigue Brahman/Atman. Thus, the constant emphasis in Vendanta that Brahman/Atman is one without a second. This is not the case in Tibetan circles. I asked a mind-only tibetan monk who spoke at Harvard University Divinity School about this. I asked if the historic Buddha's Dharmakaya was the same as mine. He said it was not. He then cautioned me that it would also be incorect to say that there was a dharmakaya that belonged to Shakyamuni buddha. I interpreted this to be a caution against the worldly temptation to grasp onto a ultimately existent self known as the "historic buddha." Other tibetans have contrasted dharmakaya and Brahman/atman by saying dharmakaya is not a subtratum underlying the world illusion and dharmakaya is not a "unique" reality as is Brahamn. It is true, there is a common notion out there that all buddhas share the dharmakaya. The dalai lama denied this in a book I read. I think the book was called "The Buddhanature." So at the very least dharmakaya differs from Brahman in the sense that at least many buddhist do not accept it as a single extramental substance. Apparently many well informed buddhists reject this idea of a single dharmakaya shared by all buddhas . On the other hand, it is important not to be too gungho in our attempts to grasp a view about the ultimate nature of mind since if we truely understood this, we would already be a buddha which I certainly am not. Other differences were pointed out by D.T. Suzuki. He pointed out that Vedanta understands Brahman in a way that sees its perfection precludes any activity. Brahman/ATman is an ocean of bliss. It is perfect in itself. Thus, the final truth about Brahamn is that it can't be viewed as acting at all. It is perfect in itself. What else does it need to do. Similiarly, Brahman is also perfect knowledge itself. It can't cognize anything else other than itself. If it did, it would be experiencing imperfect knowledge, that is some type of illusion. Any thing we experience that looks like Brahman acting or being aware of something outside of its own perfection is in fact an illusion. We as unenlightened jivas "see" saguna Brahman creating the world, or giving the "grace" of jnana to jivamuktas who escape the world illusion. However, in truth Brahman did none of those things. D.T. Suzuki contrasts this with Dharmakaya. His understsnding of dharmakaya, like that of many far eastern buddhists, does seem to accept it as a single reality. In that sense it may be similiar to Brahman. However, he points out that Dharmakaya is the Buddha who is quite aware of the suffereings of sentient beings and all other aspects of the universe in which they live. As the dharmakaya is in fact the body of the buddha who teaches sentient beings how to end their suffereing, the dharmakaya is also constantly taking action on our behalf. These are essential qualities of Suzuki's notion of the dharmakaya (as far as I can see). It is meaningless to imagine a dharmakaya that is not the union of wisdom and compassion in its "essence." (I know techically "essence" is never the best term to use when talking buddhism. Forgive me.) After all, the "essential" characteristic of the Buddha is that the Buddha turns the wheel of the dharma out of compassion for our suffering. Thus, in its "essence" dharmakaya is aware of quite a few discrete realities and is constantly acting on the behalf of those realities which are sentient and suffering. 

Another way of putting this might be, "how can I be obligated to do something that doesn't make any sense?" This is a good question, and one that I don't think is well-answered by folks who deny the rationality and evidence-basis for religion. Normative ethics can be described objectively by finishing the "ought" clause. For example: you ought to put in all the rebar specified by the engineer, if you want the concrete to withstand an earthquake; you ought to finish your vegetables, if you don't want to get constipated; you ought to write a thank-you note, if you want your friend to know he or she is appreciated. You ought to do the right thing, if you don't want to be punished for doing the wrong thing. If you can't finish the "ought" clause, then that's objectively a problem either with the "ought" or with your worldview. I think that the Christian basis for ethics is rationally satisfying on all grounds, both on its similarities with other systems (which are many) and on its peculiarities. The strongest peculiarity of Christian ethics is the perception that ethics are judged by a person who is both unmovably perfect and impossibly generous. The personal nature of the judge is a clear defeater for objections to normative ethics such as "if X is okay for people in Exampleistan, how could X be wrong for people in Counterexampleia?" A personal judge knows that doing X is either wrong or not based on the invisible conception of X in a person's moral thinking, not just based on what appears on some normative text which suffers every kind of misunderstanding and misinterpretation. 

Wittgenstein is critical of the 'private linguist' and his exclusive use of the ostensive definition, where the definition provided for a given word is an example or a 'pointing out' of what the word might refer to. But it would seem that the origin of our language is rooted in ostensive definition. It is after all how children with no prior knowledge of a public language begin to learn a language. Their mother or father points to something while stressing a given word. Wittgenstein doesn't seem to have been one to hold that the entire language game is a farce. As such, what allowed him to criticize ostensive definitions in the private language argument while not coming to criticize language acquisition through ostensive definition in the case of children? 

If we grant that there is a proposition wherein something meaningful is being asserted, does that require us to think of language as essentially representative in some way? If language didn't contain the proposition, then language could be thought of only as a 'game' to be played, wherein our words do not represent anything beyond themselves and are rather pieces and tokens to be used in the game of our behavior. But if there is granted the semantic value of the proposition, does that necessitate that at least this aspect of language must be considered representative? And if so, is it really possible that language not be representative in this regard? Isn't the proposition, or semantic affirmation/negation, an inescapable fact of our semantic behavior? 

Wittgenstein is stated as having said "we must do away with the explanation and description alone must take its place" (PI 109). But isn't this akin to the myth of the given that Sellars attacked? Can a clear distinction really be made between providing a description and providing an explanation? Doesn't the one effectively permeate the other? One example that comes to mind that seems to leave the two interconnected is the description of a banana being thrown in the air. We might describe the situation as Jim throwing the banana, or causing the banana to be thrown, into the air. But here the description of the event, namely Jim hurling the banana into the air, is inclusive of two events, the event of Jim with a banana in his hand, and the event of the little banana hurling through the air (probably much to its dissatisfaction). But, in this way, there is the occurrence of an explanation of an event within the mere 'description' of an event, the explanation being the induction of causality. Indeed, so long as there is a certain ambiguity in what single 'event' we might be offering a description of and in what circumstances we offer a description of it, it seems to be the case that any given event can give way to be an explanation just as much as it can a description. For example, when a detective asks 'what happened here?', you as a witness might give him the rundown on what happened. And yet, you are both describing what happened, insofar as you are recounting what happened, and offering an explanation, insofar as you are clarifying the situation for the person asking what happened. So there is a continuity in some cases between description and assertion, dependent on the context in which one states the occurrences of a given event. As a last bit of inquiry, is Wittgenstein's criticisms of explanation (insofar as it is a criticism of 'private states of meaning' perverting what is simply observed of 'public behavior') similar in any way to Hume's criticism of induction? Both seem to me to be criticizing a mental sort of behavior that impedes or contorts the naturalistic (or simply 'natural') experiences and observances made in our ordinary course of life. 

Well, one way that great musicians and artists have survived has been to receive commissions from wealthy people who value their art and desire either to have it for themselves or to provide it somehow for others. This sidesteps the issue of what should their role be; they now have a market role that doesn't require "marketing" anymore. I suppose that pop music itself is sort of a new phenomenon, and sprang up with the consumer products of albums and concert tickets, as well as radio advertising. I don't really have an answer to "what role outside of the market should artists and musicians have", but maybe this provides some helpful insight into what the market does provide. 

In his new-ish book "A Peculiar Glory", Christian author John Piper says that without reading any scripture, a person can identify many qualities of God/god. Theologians sometimes call this kind of insight "general revelation." Here are a few qualities that Piper thinks a person can find out about God without reading or hearing about the Bible: 

You might be pleased to learn that this was the subject of the most popular allegory by Socrates recorded by Plato: the allegory of the cave. Socrates describes people imprisoned in a cave, separated from the opening by a big rock which nevertheless admits some light inside. The light shows shadows on the inside of the cave, like a camera obscura. The people can't leave, and they can't turn around. Everything they see is shadows. According to Plato, this is what real life is like: everything we see gives us in impression of real things (or what he calls "forms"), but we really don't see forms. 

Quine criticizes analyticity for presupposing another notion, that of synonymy, which for Quine either must be explained in terms of analyticity or synonymy itself. But what exactly does Quine think needs to be clarified as regards to analyticity and synonymy? By what standard does Quine judge analyticity/synonymy to be unclear to begin with? 

One of the reasons Wittgenstein thought the exclusive use of ostensive definition failed was because it opened the possibility that a given symbol's meaning was sourced from whatever sensation someone was having at the time, so that a symbol's meaning was whatever seemed to be the case to the private linguist. He then concluded that in this situation truth and falsity couldn't be rationally talked about. This point was made because Wittgenstein thought that the values of truth and falsity could only apply to cases where the one or the other could actually be applied. In other words, Wittgenstein thought that only symbols that could be doubted could have meaning and the values 'truth' and 'falsity' applied to them. But why is this? It seems to be the case that Wittgenstein thought that otherwise what was being dealt with was a tautology, where the sense of meaning was lost. But couldn't there be other meaningful self-evident sort of statements where what's occurring isn't a tautology and where it wouldn't be reasonable nor conceivable to doubt? 

Quine's naturalistic holism is marked by the idea that our methodology should be concerned with empirical data as understood by modern science in conjunction with the idea that every theory is underdetermined by the data it espouses to interpret. This seems to lead to the conclusion that our theories are never certain, and are always open to revision. But suppose the traditional epistemologist thinks that what Quine means in the first half of this supposition, regarding his empiricism, is in need of clarification. The epistemologist would want to ask Quine just what qualifies as 'science' or more plainly 'empirical'. Or perhaps in questioning Quine's holism the traditional epistemologist wants to know why Quine thinks to begin with that a theory being undertetermined by empirical data is suggestive of what Quine thinks it's suggestive of. Furthermore, one might question the globalism of Quine's holism, and how he moves from points of an empirical nature to knowledge simpliciter. These questions might very well arise in the spirit of Quine's holism itself, wherein their answers are uncertain and dictated by whatever conditions characterize their place in the 'web of belief', in which case Quine could respond to them with relative ease. But where they are truly interesting is where they arise outside of the context of Quine's holism, in question of Quine's holism. The traditional epistemologist holds that unless these questions have specific answers there is no justification of Quine's holism, no reason for them to accept Quine's holism (and no reason for Quine to accept his own holism). Indeed, when these questions are asked in the context of accepting Quine's holism as true, an inevitable circularity ensues, as Quine himself admits of his naturalism elsewhere. For Quine's relativistic holism requires that there be no set 'criterion' for determining what is and isn't 'science', nor even a set criterion for what is and isn't 'holism'. To accept Quine's holism is expected by Quine to be a provision that stems from his holism itself. But be it that accepting his holism is what is in question, it seems that Quine is begging the question against those who are seeking a standard or justification of his methodology.
