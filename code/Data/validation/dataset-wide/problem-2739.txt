The "Re..." words are certainly the catch in machined knowledge, but I would argue for "Reproduction" through "Recognition," as opposed to "Reflection." It is interesting that you cite Kant here, for his transcendental philosophy is, in my view, both the best critique of reductive physicalism and potentially the best set of instructions for assembling fundamental concepts as integrated circuits into artificial intelligence and even, perhaps, self-identified "personhood." All the "parts" are there in the transcendental kit, just open up the "intuiting" valves and add sensible flows. A good candidate for generating "reflection" are the weirdly unpredictable, pulsing patterns of electromagnetic oscillations produced by video cameras observing themselves, recording recordings.This might potentially bring in a very fine-grained type of mutual "recognition" or symmetrical "disequilibrium" in machine relations. To me, the greatest drawback to machine consciousness and personhood is finding the logical counterpart of love, by which I mean "reproduction" through "recognition" in the Hegelian sense. One capacity of brains, far too neglected in physical accounts, is that they self-select and reproduce themselves. Here, Von Neumann's Universal Replicators provide a mathematical description of "immortal" machine genealogy requiring overproduction, errors, and selection. It also requires a "software" and "hardware" interacting dualism. But this is still way too simple. To attain personhood machines must not only recognize a "categorial instruction" they must see themselves as interchangeable "ends-in-themselves" which is a paradox. They must endlessly regenerate and resolve "paradoxes," including the fundamental paradox of gender... and some machine equivalent of in utero or a priori conceiving: i.e., the state in which two "persons" identify as "one" and then "one" person develops into "two" persons in "one," finally separating into a conceptual unity of "three" persons, the minimal unit of regeneration. I say this to emphasize the degree to which paradox and irrationality must enter into the machine logic for anything approaching "personhood" to emerge. Kant does provide a promising blueprint. And he was unique in his day for even a modest mention of sexuality. But in my own view, most approaches to AI underestimate this necessary substrate, those capacities of practical and aesthetic judgment that "brains" must include to selectively reproduce "brains." 

Stereotyping. I'm sure every person of faith doesn't match all 3 of these reasons. They are more of a caricature, and that might be a fourth reason: Those people who consider you weak because of your faith may be stereotyping you. 

How do you distinguish faith from gullibility? Perhaps faith is sometimes seen as a kind of gullibility. Few people would criticize you if you have faith "the sun will come up tomorrow" or "I have faith that I'm skillful and smart enough to support my family for the foreseeable future." It's the faith in uncommon things that raises eyebrows. To use the over-used Sagan quote: "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." It's the willingness to believe extraordinary claims on inconclusive evidence that might strike some as gullible. How do you know what to have faith in and what not to have faith in? Why do people have faith in one religion but not another? Often it's based on what they want to believe, or what they think ought to be true. (See $URL$ Or they will believe things based on the culture they were brought up in, while discounting equally plausible claims from cultures they weren't brought up in. Some say you know what to have faith in based on feeling. But that ignores the many who have feelings that are just as strong, but towards a different belief. Or it ignores the selection biases, conflicts of interest, and other influences that can subconsciously shape our feelings. Or it ignores the numerous times that feeling alone has proven to be unreliable. So to some, it may seem like faith is weakness if it appears that someone will selectively turn off their critical thinking skills for beliefs they have a vested interest in maintaining. They are inflexible. There a numerous examples of this. Consider the bumper sticker "The Bible says it. I believe it. That settles it." Or this quote from Kurt Wise: 

I should know better than to jump into this fray. But I can't help myself since this is something I've wondered about myself. Here are the reasons I've collected over the years. Often times I don't remember where I first learned of these reasons, I'm going to leave this un-cited.
