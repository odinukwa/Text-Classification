I strongly suggest to read Working with Multiple instance of SQL Server. If it is not interrupting at all STOP the SQL Server services which is not required its more safer approach. Microsoft has history of behaving incorrectly when instance is removed from server having multiple instances present. I have seen it multiple times IMHO If you have multiple instances its more safer to use command prompt to remove SQL Server instance as compared to GUI. Below is the dummy script. You have to open CMD as administrator and move to folder where Setp.exe file is present and then run below script. 

I could not put this as comment so here it is for you. It is not compete answer to your question because your question can either be correctly answered by person working in Microsoft or Paul Randal(I guess). All I can say for all paractical purposes every information is logged. You can read the contents of log file using undocumented command 

The message is bit misleading as ideally there cannot be a table with object id 0 and inex ID -1. I would quote from Paul Randal's blog 

If table on other hand has records you would get tabular output. For more understanding I suggest you read following blogs from Paul Randal 

First thing is after changing recovery model from full to simple you loose point in time recovery. Is this database production database(which i feel it is)? if so you are not doing correct thing. If database fails at this point in time you would loose point in time recovery and would loose data are you ok with it. If you switch from the full or bulk-logged recovery model to the simple recovery model, you break the backup log chain. Therefore, its strongly recommend that you back up the log immediately before switching, which allows you to recover the database up to that point. After switching, you need to take periodic data backups to protect your data and to truncate the inactive portion of the transaction lo 

Reason I say I don't see any logic is because SQL Server memory code is designed to cache as much objects and data as possible to avoid any physical I/O. This actually helps in SQL Server performing better. If you set max server memory to 450 G SQL Server can immediately use all that memory, any why not you have asked it to use it. Also note that there are certain components, memory to which, are allocated by buffer pool but if allocated that will also be counted under SQL Server memory utilization. 

So you can see you can take transaction log backup on any replica no matter whether it is synchronous or asynchronous replica. 

As already pointed SQL Server 2008 R2 SP2 is not fully supported. As a general rule after launch of new service pack within one year previous SP becomes unsupported. Following is difference between mainstarem support and extended support taken from here Think of Mainstream support as “normal”. In other words, mainstream support means Microsoft supports a product with its full offerings including paid incident support, hotfix support, security updates, etc. When a product enters the Extended Support “phase”, the game changes: 1) We still provide security updates at no charge to all customers 2) You can still call CSS or create a case online per the normal support offerings (pay per incident, Premier, etc) But…you cannot obtain a non-security hotfix from Microsoft for no charge. In order to obtain a non-security hotfix, you must purchase an Extended Hotfix Support Agreement. Extended Hotfix Support Agreements are available for Premier customers. Contact your Technical Account Manager for more information. The extended support might involves more cost than normal support and is not available to everyone. If your firm has premier support tie up with MS then you can get extended support eaisly otherwise its costly and bit difficult. This is as per my region MS support/licensing is complex and you should speak to licesning expert to get more information about extended support. MS says that CU should be only applied if user is facing bug which is fixed in that CU. If not Microsoft recommends not to apply it. SP's are more throughly tested and more reliable as compared to CU. So I would also say unless you face issue dont go for CU.If you want help in deploying SP please refer to This Link(its for SS 2012 but process/steps remains same) 

As you already know there is No general formula to calculate max server memory you can do some quick maths and reach to a value but still you would need help of Perfmon counters at last to monitor memory usage and change accordingly. I know below general formula and I use it as well. I learned this formula from This Link For SQL Server 2005 to 2008 R2 Please note from SQL Server 2005 to 2008 R2 max server memory only controls buffer pool. So max server memory configuration is bit tedious here and involves few calculations 

Now this is a clue we have to focus upon. So does this means the installation is trying to look for some key and is not able to find it and hence this message. Well this may not be as simple as it seems. This Blog says that this may be because . The same has been highlighted into this MS KB Article. There are 3 resolution mentioned I have highlighted the easiest one. 

Your question was where would the snapshot Index reside which I assumed you were asking about where would intermediate sort operations happens. 

Yes its recommended not shrink log file. You need to make sure you do not run any transaction which does data manipulations. You can do whatever data manipulation you like but make sure amount of rows this manipulation is dealing is not . Log file just reacts to what you are running so you have control in it. Make sure after each data manipulation you manually run checkpoints SQL Server will never shrink data and log files by itself for that you have command. 

Answer is simple you did not restored a full backup first. Differential backup is only valid from latest full backup because it has information about extents that has changed after full backup has been done. So unless you take full backup and restore and then restore a differential backup it will keep on failing with the error you got. 

Yes they will run. Logshipping is simple copy and movement of logs so when you bring secondary database online it just brings the database online it does not affects any job running. So you should disable all backup,copy,restore and alerts jobs. When next time on primary, backup job wil run it will succeed even copy job will succeed on secondary but restore job would fail on secondary as database is online and logs cannot be restored more over log chain would be broken. 

This is how SQl Server thinks with any other third party tool. If you use any othet third party tool to take backup the VIRTUAL_DEVICE would be the location where you took backup and this would be logged into errorlog. 

You can fix max server memory using the query but remember, SQL Server can still use memory outside buffer pool for third party DLL's and extended stored procs. This can lead SQL Server to use memory more that what is restricted in buffer pool Please read this article. It would help you in setting starting value for max server memory. You should use below counters to set correct value for max server memory and monitor SQL Server memory usage. SQLServer:Buffer Manager--Page Life Expectancy(PLE): PLE shows for how long page remain in buffer pool. The longer it stays the better it is. Its common misconception to take 300 as a baseline for PLE. But it is not,I read it from Jonathan Kehayias book( troubleshooting SQL Server) that this value was baseline when SQL Server was of 2000 version and max RAM one could see was from 4-6 G. Now with 200G or RAM coming into picture this value is not correct. He also gave the formula( tentative) how to calculate it. Take the base counter value of 300 presented by most resources, and then determine a multiple of this value based on the configured buffer cache size, which is the 'max server memory' sp_ configure option in SQL Server, divided by 4 GB. So, for a server with 32 GB allocated to the buffer pool, the PLE value should be at least (32/4)*300 = 2400. So far this has done good to me so I would recommend you to use it. SQLServer:Buffer Manager--CheckpointPages/sec: Checkpoint pages /sec counter is important to know about memory pressure because if buffer cache is low then lots of new pages needs to be brought into and flushed out from buffer pool, due to load checkpoint's work will increase and will start flushing out dirty pages very frequently. If this counter is high then your SQL Server buffer pool is not able to cope up with requests coming and we need to increase it by increasing buffer pool memory or by increasing physical RAM and then making adequate changes in Buffer pool size. Technically this value should be low if you are looking at line graph in perfmon this value should always touch base for stable system. SQLServer:Buffer Manager--Freepages: This value should not be less you always want to see high value for it. SQLServer:Memory Manager--Memory Grants Pending: If you see memory grants pending in buffer pool your server is facing SQL Server memory crunch and increasing memory would be a good idea. For memory grants please read this article SQLServer:memory Manager--Target Server Memory: This is amount of memory SQL Server is trying to acquire. SQLServer:memory Manager--Total Server memory This is current memory SQL Server has acquired. 

Yes this is very much possible and I have this in my environment. Please note that in this case you would not be able to leverage automatic failover of replicas from SQL Server FCI to standalone node 3. You would have to reply on manual failover. This is because the AG replica resides on FCI which has its own failover.
