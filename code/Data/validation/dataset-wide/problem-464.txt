Snug! It wont work if the helmet is not securely strapped to your head. Here is a good article/post about wearing helmets. 

I'm looking to start tracking my speed and cadence for my iOS app, Cycle Meter. The app works great for distance, time, but is not accurate at all for measuring my speed. So I'm thinking of buying a Garmin or a Wahoo speed/cadance sensor and wanted to get the community's opinion on the two. I'm not worried about price. More about quality, functionality. The two in question are: $URL$ $URL$ Update: been using the Wahoo one for a few weeks now and have to say that I'm very happy with it. I've been in a lot of rain as well with no issues. 

I just recently went through a Specialized BG Pro-Fit (was about $200), and have to say that I'm super happy with the results and experience. The fitter was telling me about some others out there that cost a lot more and take 4+ hours and are more technical, or use more hardware, ie: lasers, though, I could not find them online with some simple searches. Does anyone have any good experiences with others, or know of any others, and If you've done the Specialized BG Fit, did you like your results? Edit: The BG Fit site goes in more detail 

Good fit. I purchased some semi-cheap shoes that initially fit well, but after some serious riding, my big toe was rubbing against the inside way to much, causing lots of pain. I went ahead and purchased a size bigger, which solved the problem. Also, check on the return policy, as Mike's Bikes in SF does not accept the shoes after installing the cleats, even if you have not left the store! 

Based on my experience, determining the chainline based on specifications of the components (BB and Crankset) and a simple math calculation is the best approach. This is because I was having a hard time to ballpark the chainline. I then found out that the manufacturer of the crankset I use provides a specification document which describes the recommended spindle length of the BB and the chainline measurement. To get the spacers adjustment correct, I use a table provided by Surly: surlybikes.com/files/SS_Spacer_Kit.pdf . The table isn't really specific for Surly spacers but it only works with Shimano hubs. Surly SS kits are expensive, so I recommend to purchase ones from a Taiwanese company which can be found on Ebay. 

Find a comfortable saddle. Go to your LBS and ask their opinions. A lot of people suggest leather saddles, like Brooks or Selle Anatomica. A good saddle is expensive, but it is a worth upgrade and you will be surprised how big the difference is between a cheap saddle and a good one. If you are on a tight budget, a padded short is a cheaper option. Do you use a bike rack and panniers? for a long ride especially on hot weather, a set of pannier is better than a backpack. I think your current tires are already pretty good but it might be worth a try to have wider and fatter tires for more comfortable rides. I assume your current tires are 32mm wide, so upgrade to 35mm tires. 

Before I add my two cents here I'll mention that this post is rather old to be unanswered. If you figured this out already write an answer and choose it as "the answer" so it doesn't show up as unanswered and others can learn from it. So, by "play" you could mean front to back (as in the length of the post/bolt) or around the bushing (as in a difference in the diameter of the post and hole in the brake arm). I just checked the oldest canti-brake bike I've got (from the 1980s) and there is no play in either sense described above. So I would attempt to solve that problem next as the things you've already tried are all good, especially your choice of pads. You might want to try the salmon colored rather than the dual compound though. They are the better of the two compounds for braking but they wear out faster. If it is the former type of play I agree with the advice of @Daniel R Hicks. If it is the other and you don't have replaceable canti-studs you ought to replace the brakes (arms) themselves. If there is play when they are at rest they will shimmy and shudder when braking. If there is play due to the strength of fork then you need a brake booster as suggested by @armb. Another question for you - are both the brakes and levers original to the bike or have you replaced either? Mixing canti and v-brake components will cause problems but I haven't heard of noise being one of them. A final note - take heart! I have a friend who is a fanatic about bike maintenance. He was a bike mechanic, but now is an engineer in aerospace and his bike stuff is rather high end. Last year he adjusted and replaced everything and never found the source of the noise. He replaced the bike instead! 

The only bad thing about the app builder is the app itself is sluggish over time (something wrong with my browser?), but it's no a big deal, since you can always save a route and refresh the page. Also, If I plan a long route, I've found strava heatmap is pretty useful , although popular routes don't always have the least elevation: $URL$ 

If your goal is comfort over speed, I would emphasize in three upgrades which don't break your bank: 

You are asking about converting inner tubes to tubeless. As far as I know, tubeless system isn't 100% puncture proof, if you get a nail on the road, it's impossible to fix right away and you need to call a taxi. For me, inner tubes are still the best options for bike commuting. I can think of several ways: 

I've known something like this: $URL$ but I don't know this will work for casual bikes. I also agree with @reiheit, internal geared hub is much more nicer idea. An example of this is bike rental system in Taipei ($URL$ I've been in Taipei for a while, and these bikes were awesome. They had 5 speeds (If my memory is correct.). Moreover, Internally geared hub is less prone to failures, and I think the bikes require less maintenance. 

Technically, it's highly possible, since you can export your routes to .gpx files and manipulate the timestamps. A .gpx file is actually an xml file which is similar to html files with tags. Each tag tells you the current longitude, latitude, and the current time stamp. You actually can edit the .gpx file with a text editor, i.e. notepad and edit the file by yourself. However, you need to know the exact long-lat where you want to "pause".
