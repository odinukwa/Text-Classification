This is not true for $S^2$. Namely, one can construct two convex non-isometric spherical triangles such that all medians have length $\frac{3\pi}{4}-\varepsilon$. 1) The first triangle is the standard equilateral triangle. Clearly medians of such triangles all have the same length and their length vary from $0$ to $\pi$. 2) The second triangle will be a perturbation of the following one. Take on $S^2$ two opposite points $A$ and $B$ and join them by two geodesics (of length $\pi$) that bound a sector with angle $\frac{3\pi}{4}$. Call one of these geodesics $AB$. And choose $C$ as the mid point of the other geodesic. It is easy to see that for this degenerate triangle all medians have length $\frac{3\pi}{4}$. Now, by perturbing slightly $A$, $B$ and $C$ one can decrease the lengths of all medians by the same amount. Note. It is important in the second construction that by varying $A$ and $B$ as little as we want, we can achieve that the median starting from $C$ takes any length in $(0,\pi)$. However the length of two other medians stay close to $\frac{3\pi}{4}$. PS, hyperbolic case. Concerning the hyperbolic case, it looks like the answer is positive. If I would like to prove it, I would do as follows. i) Consider the map from the convex cone in $\mathbb R_{\ge 0}^3$ consisting of triples $(a,b,c)$ satisfying the (non-strict) triangle inequality to itself: lengths of sides $\to$ lengths of medians. ii) Realise that this map if proper (preimage of compact is compact). And it is an isomorphism on the boundary on the cone. iii) The map is a "diffeo" close to the point $(0,0,0)$ - because it is so for Euclidean triangles. iv) This is the most complicated bit -- show that the map has non-vanishing differential. This is where one needs to make a calculation. But it looks very plausible. v) If all the above holds then the map is an isomorphism. QED 

Let us show that a globaly generated torsion line bundle $L$ on a (compact) complex surface is trivial. Ideed, a globally generated line bundle has at least one section, say $s$. Let us take it. If $s$ has no zeros, then $L$ is trivial. But if $s$ vanishes somewhere then any positive power $L^n$ has a section $s^n$ that vanishes at the same points. So any power of $L$ is not trivial, i.e. $L$ is not a torsion bundle, contradiction. Notice that we did not use the fact that the surface is smooth. And we also did not use the fact that we work with a surface... 

I would be very happy if such material existed!!! But just to statisfy the first curiosity, There is a 1 hour lecture of Richard Thomas online on MSRI Counting curves in 3-folds, 2009 $URL$ I would like to add just one little thing that I know about DT and find cool. Consider a 3-dimensional CY manifold X with a holomorphic volume form $W$. Statement. On the space of smooth 2-dimesnional surfaces in X there is a natural (possibly multi-valued) functional F, defined by $W$. Moreover, holomorphic curves in X are exactly the critical points of the functional. Definition of the functional. Take a surface S, and define F(S)=0, for any other surface $S_1$ homological to S consider a 3-manifold M whose boundary is $S-S_1$. Integrate W over M. This gives the value of F at $S_1$. In is not hard to check that holomorphic curves are critical points of F, so couniting holomorphic curves in a CY 3-fold can be seen as finding the number of critical points of a functional. 

For any even $k>4$ there is a decomposition of $S^2$ into $k$ congruent triangles with angles $\pi/2,\pi/2, 4\pi/k$. For $k=n+2$ in order to get a decomposition of $S^n$ into $k$ congruent simplexes you should just inscribe in $S^n$ the regular simplex and project its hyper-faces to the sphere from its centre. In general, a sphere of arbitrary dimension $n$ can be decomposed in arbitrary large number of congruent simplexes, for example into $k2^{n-1}$ simplexes with any $k>2$. This can be done by induction. The $n=1$ case is obvious, to go from $S^n$ to $S^{n+1}$ just put $S^n$ into $S^{n+1}$ as the equatorial sphere and consider the suspension of the simplicial decomposition of $S^n$ (a hypersimplex of such decomposition is the convex hull of a union of a hypersimplex in $S^n$ with one of the poles of $S^{n+1}$). 

Corrected according to the comment of Scott. Let me show that in the case you blow up $\mathbb P^2$ in one point an throw away preimages of three lines trough the point you get something with non-abelian fundamental group. The blow up of $\mathbb P^2$ at one point is a $\mathbb P^1$ bundle over $\mathbb P^1$, so when we throw away $3$ fibers we get a fibration $\mathbb P^1\to S\to \ C$, where $C$ is $\mathbb P^1$ punctured in $3$ points. The long exact sequence of homothopy groups reads as follows: $...\to \pi_1(\mathbb P^1)\to \pi_1(S)\to \pi_1(C)\to \pi_0 \mathbb (\mathbb P^1)\to ...$ $...\to 0 \to \pi_1(S)\to \pi_1(C)\to 0 $ So $\pi_1(S)=F_2$, where $F_2$ is a free group on two generators. I can not say anything about the general situation... 

Here is a reasoning which uses (as Peter's one) the fact that on every hyperelliptic curve the hyper-elliptic involution $\sigma$ commutes with every conformal self-map (since hyper-elliptic involution is unique). Suppose $\sigma_1$ is an orientation reversing fixed point free involution of $B$. Then since $\sigma\sigma_1=\sigma_1\sigma$ the action of $\sigma_1$ on $B$ descends to an orientation reversing involution (call it $\sigma_2$) on $\mathbb CP^1=B/\sigma_1$. Clearly $\sigma_2$ permutes $6$ vertices of the octahedron and it does not fix any of them. So $\sigma_2$ is the central symmetry of (octahedral) $\mathbb CP^1$. Now, take on $\mathbb CP^1$ any big circle $S^1$ (invariant under $\sigma_2$) that does not pass through the vertices. Let $S'^1$ be its preimage on $B$. $S'^1$ is a circle the double covers $S^1$ (because $S^1$ splits $6$ vertices on $\mathbb CP^1$ into two groups of $3$ verities). Since $\sigma_2$ makes the half-turn of $S^1$ it follows that $\sigma_1$ makes a quoter turn of $S'^1$. So it is not an involution of $B$. Contradiction. 

I think this statement does not hold. The following tetrahedron should give a counterexample: $A=(-0.5, 0, 0)$, $B=(1,0,0)$, $C=(0,\varepsilon^2, \varepsilon)$, $D=(0,\varepsilon^2, -\varepsilon)$, $1>>\varepsilon>0$. Here $BCD$ has largest area, but the spherical angles at $C$ and $D$ should be significantly larger than the one at $A$. (I have done the calculation only approximatively, but I believe it is true). 

I have a (basic?) question in topology. Question 1. Is it possible to characterise compact $4$-manifolds $M^4$, such that almost complex structures on $M^4$ are uniquely defined up to homotopy by their first Chern classes? Or is there at least a large class of $4$-manifolds where this is true? Maybe there is a reference? Recall the theorem of Wu. Denote by $\tau$ the signature of $M^4$ and by $e$ the Euler characteristics. Then for any element $c\in H^2(M^4,\mathbb Z)$ with $c^2=3\tau+2e$ and such that $c\; {\rm mod} \;\mathbb Z_2= w_2\in H^2(M^4,\mathbb Z_2)$ there is an almost complex structure $J$ on $M^4$, such that $c_1(M,J)=c$ (in particular, as Paul says $e+\tau=0\; {\rm mod} \;4$). However this $J$ might be non-unique, up to homotopy among almost complex structures with $c_1=c$, as the following example shows. Example. Let $M^4=S^1\times S^3$, then the tangent bundle is trivial, so almost complex structures on $M^4$ can be identified up to homotopy with homotopy classes of maps $M^4\to S^2$ (see page 11 in The geometry of Four-manifolds Donaldson Kronheimer). Maps $S^3\to S^2$ can have different Hopf invariants, but $c_1=0$ since $S^1\times S^3$ has no second cohomology... Added Question 2. Is there at least one manifold that satisfies condition of Question 1? In McDuff-Salamon (footnote on page 120) it is written, that if $M^4$ is spin then there are precisely two homotopy classes of $J$ with given $c_1$ (this is said to be related to $\pi_4(S^2)=\mathbb Z_2$). But since $S^1\times S^3$ is spin this statement from McDuff-Salamon seem to contradict to my conclusion (that for $S^1\times S^3$ homotopy classes are can have different Hopf invariants). So, where is the mistake?...:) 

Every trajectory of a light ray inside the tube can be obtained by "developing" the corresponding trajectory in the billiard. To analyse the billiard we will construct its phase portrait using canonical coordinates. The first coordinate is the distance along the boundary of the billiard from its up-most corner to the place were the ray hits the billiard's boundary. This distance is counted counter-clockwise and varies from $0$ to $2+\pi$ ($2+2\pi$ is the perimeter of the billiard). The second coordinate is the cosine of the angle between the trajectory of the reflected ray and the boundary of the billiard. This coordinate varies from $-1$ to $1$. The picture below shows one particular trajectory in the phase space. 

I would like to know something more than what is written on wikipedia $URL$ What would be some large (largest?) class of topological spaces for which $\chi$ is defined, so that all standard properties hold, for example that $\chi(X)=\chi(Y)+\chi(Z)$ if $X=Y \cup Z$, ($Y\cap Z=0$). ADDED. The answer of Algori indicates that a reasonably large class of spaces for which Euler characteristics can be defined are locally compact spaces $X$, whose one point compactification $\bar X$ is a CW complex. Then we can define $\chi(X)=\chi(\bar X)-1$. For example, the Euler characteristics of an open interval according to this definition is $-1$. This definition rases a second (maybe obvious) question. Question 2. Suppose $X$ is a locally compact space whose 1 point compactification is a $CW$ complex, and $Y$ is a subspace of $X$ such that both $Y$ and $X\setminus Y$ have this property. Is it ture that $\chi(X)=\chi(Y)+\chi(X\setminus Y)$? Also, I was thinking, that Euler characteristics is more fundamental then homology.But can it be defined for spaces, where homology is not defined? Finally, Quiaochu pointed out below that a very similar question was already discussed previously on mathoverflow. 

There are some very good reasons why the majority of calculations are done for algebraic manifolds. Maybe the most naive reason is as follows: it is harder to solve PDEs than to draw lines through two points in a space. Somehow everyone knows that for two points in $\mathbb CP^n$ there is exactly one line that passes through them, and so a certain GW invariant equals $1$. From the point of view of symplectic geometry this is a completely non-trivial result. Indeed, if you take the standard symplectic structure $w$ on $\mathbb CP^n$ (coming from the Fubini-Study metric), take $J$ that is tamed by $w$ and try to make the calculation, you will first need to know that almost complex curves exist for $J$ locally (which is already non-trivial), then using different compactness arguments will need to homothopy $J$ to the standard complex structure and prove that GW invariant does not change during homothopy, and finally once you get the standard complex structure on $\mathbb CP^n$ perform the above elementary calculation to get $1$ line through any two points. Gromov non-squeezing $URL$ is also based on this idea, so all the above is a completely non-trivial task... A different reason that majority of calculations are done in algebraic case is that up to recently majority of compact symplectic manifolds we constructed from algebraic pieces, by taking Gompf's sum. In this case again on can try first to calculate GW invariants for these pieces and then glue them. Also in small dimensions symplectic manifolds with sufficiently non-trivial GW invariants tend to be algebraic. For example, in dimension 4 it is conjectured that if a GW invariant of rational curves passing trough one point is non-zero then the 4-manifold is a unirulled or rational surface (in particular, it is algebraic). If you want an explicit calculation for manifolds that are not Kahler, check the following article of McDuff "Hamiltonian S^1 manifolds are uniruled" $URL$ . She proves non-vanishing of certain GW invariants for manifolds admitting Hamiltonian $S^1$ action and it is not hard to construct such non-Kahler manifolds. More generally, Tien-Jun Li and Ruan argue in "Symplectic Birational Geometry" $URL$ that rational GW invariants are responsible for birational geometry of symplectic manifolds.
