As @Cerberus has commented, these are often lumped into the category of 'determiners', which in English also includes what you've referred to as articles (the, a), possessive pronouns (my, your), and some demonstratives (this, that). These are different from normal adjectives in the following ways: 

To the best of my knowledge, there's a node for topics that's a child of C' (and a sister of either TP or another C', IIRC). It's the same place that fronted nouns in V2 languages like German and Norwegian go. I believe some theorists have posited a whole topic-focus structure up there (for languages like Latin), but I unfortunately don't remember how it works exactly. 

The problem with the language/dialect distinction is that it always, always, always involves politics. Even when trying to do things on a purely linguistic basis, there are far too many borderline cases and questionable situations (e.g. dialect continua, one-sided intelligibility, etc) - you will never end up with a wholly unbiased classification. That said, most (maybe even all) non-Japanese linguists recognise Ryuukyuuan as a group of languages separate from Japanese, regardless of how many Ryuukyuuan languages they count. I would guess that the 'canonical' Japanese view, that Ryuukyuuan is just a set of Japanese dialects, comes from nationalism and the very inaccurate and outdated view of Japan as an almost totally homogenous country - even Ainu was called a 'dialect', and it's totally unrelated to Japanese! I don't know how many Japanese linguists still regard them as dialects instead of languages, though. The linguistic criteria fairly unambiguously support the separate-language analysis - there is a clear gap in intelligibility between the Kyuushuu mainland and the Amami archipelago. It actually turns out that Ryuukyuuan as a whole is genetically closer to Northeast Kyuushuu than anywhere in the south, but it took until 2003 (in a paper by Leon Serafim) for anyone to notice. If you show Japanese speakers a video of someone speaking Ryuukyuuan (without explaining it) and ask them if it's Japanese, they will definitely say it's not - I actually came across a video on YouTube recently that was a quiz asking the viewer to distinguish audio clips of Japanese dialects and Ryuukyuuan languages from clips other East Asian languages :P Now, it may turn out that Ryuukyuuan is genetically a sub-branch of a Japanese-internal dialect group, but it has been innovative enough since it split off that it still counts as a group of separate languages. I don't know about Hachijou - I know it's very very different from the rest of Japanese, but I don't know if there's a consensus as to a separate status. If I were to venture a guess, I would bet that not only Hachijou but also a number of other dialects from Japan's main islands ought to be considered separate languages rather than dialects - though these might be a bit more muddled by the dialect continuum problem than Ryuukyuuan or Hachijou. 

English seems to have rules that are much more simple than its cousin German and its influencer French, as well as most of the languages that those are related to. What caused this? I suspect it's because there is so much influence on the language from two separate sources, but I could be wrong. EDIT: By this I mean when it comes to conjugation and compound words and number of phonemes, etc., etc., English has simplified very much. Alternative question that basically means the same thing: why has English simplified more than its cousins. PIE was much more complex, and I'm sure Proto-Germanic was much more complex as well; it's obvious that Latin is more complex than French, and I assume Proto-Germanic was much more complex than German. Why has English simplified one step further than these other two languages, in terms of grammatical complexity. 

I'm a linguistics major and I'm considering a minor in sociology (among others). In what ways do these fields overlap? More specifically, what types of sociology classes are good for a linguistics major? I assume anything having to do with epidemics would be terrific, as that would explain how obscure words make it into common usage. 

For example, a friend of mine posted a picture of a book series on Facebook and the start of his caption was "Read all 13!" I initially interpretted this as an imperative sentence ([ɹid] all 13), but after reading the entire capture, I figured out that it was actually a declarative sentence about what he had done ([ɹɛd] all 13). Is there a term for this phenomenon? I dub it "homonym confusion" if it lacks a name! 

Any language is, ultimately, able to convey any idea that a speaker might wish to convey. Certain languages might find certain ideas easier to convey than others (for reasons ranging from 'having a grammatical structure that's convenient for that' to 'having a large and developed technical vocabulary for that field'), but you can say anything in any language, even if you have to resort to loanwords / on-the-spot coinings or convoluted sentence structures. You might be able to rate languages on how easily they can express certain individual concepts (for example, a number of languages in the Amazon would rate very high on a scale of how easy it is to note where information was obtained from; Korean and Javanese (yes, with a v) would rate high on a scale of how easy it is to reference social hierarchy, etc); but it mostly evens out on average - few, if any, languages struggle more than others on the whole. (And really, most of the difficulty that comes with conveying complicated information is due to just not having the words, a problem that is -very- easily solvable!) 

Your analysis is correct - the typical criterion is whether or not the affix/particle seems to act as part of the word it attaches to. When nice phonological demonstrations like vowel harmony aren't available, prosody is the next recourse. If prosody isn't helpful, you're pretty much left with an open question - you have to reason from the rest of the language's typology, and if that provides no further help, you're basically stuck. Many languages with a long history of being written don't follow the above criteria exactly, and often divide words from affixes based on either the etymology of the morphemes in question or on historical spelling patterns. Some languages, in either their native systems or in romanisations, largely ignore the criteria, though - Japanese particles seem very much like they ought to be considered affixes (certainly they're not separable prosodically, and they've undergone some word-medial sound changes to their initial consonants), but the prevailing non-scientific romanisations (and several scientific romanisations) treat them as separate words. 

In terms on laminal consonants, the "flat" part specifically refers to the part of the tongue which contacts the roof of the mouth. So the body of the tongue is curled up, and the blade of the tongue is flat against the roof of the mouth. In practice, there is very little surface area actually in contact, but the point of contact sets the position of the whole tongue. 

Really, it depends on what language you're coming from. For example, a lot of people struggle with the phonology of the language because there is a lot more to it than their native language. If you're coming from a language like Spanish with a whopping five vowels, it can be difficult to get a hang of the 21 vowels, give or take, that we have in English. I know speakers of Romance languages that have been in the US for decades and still struggle to contrast certain vowels. The same can be said for /θ/ and /ð/ (the "th" sounds), which aren't super common across languages and can be hard to pronounce if you aren't used to it. However, this doesn't make English "easy" or "hard" to learn, because any language you learn is going to have new sounds that you struggle with. The vowels and some consonants are a struggle for some Spanish speakers, but Arabic speakers won't have much trouble learning the consonants of English, because most of the "hard" English consonants are in Modern Standard Arabic. For some learners, the biggest struggle is grammar. Many Europeans learn English and think that the grammar tends to be simpler because there is no gender, verb conjugation is a lot simpler, etc. However, if your native language is Mandarin Chinese, a language with extremely simple morphology compared to English, then learning to put "-ed" or "-ing" at the end of verbs and to put determiners in front of words (like "a" and "the"), is going to be a struggle. Really, it's impossible to speak in general terms about why English might be considered "easy" or "hard." It depends entirely on your native language. What's easy for one group of learners (Romance language speakers learning the grammar rules) could be a struggle for another (Chinese speakers learning grammar). 

It seems like it would work in much the same way that 'there' does in English - it doesn't specify any actual direction other than 'away'. I would assume that =[tok] means 'away from the general area that contains both the speaker and listener'. If Akatek does have morphemes like this that encode relative specific directions, I'd imagine that they'd be explicitly linked to the direction the speaker was facing. 

I'm trying to rationalise (General American) English vowel pronunciations as a system with seven-or-so underlying vowels, varying in realisation due to length/stress (unstressed, short stressed or long stressed) and environment (e.g. being deleted before /ɹ/, and so on). I haven't come up against any counterexamples yet, but they may well be out there; and I'm not wholly sure that my methodology makes sense (where the underlying phonemes are so very far removed from any of their realisations - e.g. /aː/ typically realised as [ɛj]). I suppose my question is this - is the fact that you can fairly well analyse Modern English vowels as having length just an artifact of history, or are length distinctions still part of Modern English's active phonology? 

A sentence is infelicitous when it's grammatical but nonsensical. See, for example, Chomsky's famous 'colourless green ideas sleep furiously' - there's nothing wrong with the sentence on a grammatical level, but actually attempting to turn it into useful information fails nonetheless. If ungrammaticality is a grammatical problem, infelicity is a semantic problem. 

Central Rotokas ($URL$ It has five vowels (/a i u e o/) and three consonants (/p t k/), for a total of 8 phonemes. 

It seems to me that despite the fact that Middle English long vowels have long since shifted dramatically, their descendants still pattern like long vowels in modern English. Since there's really very few cases where some kind of diagnostic alternation might be triggered, I only have two points of potentially helpful data: 

There are a few theories about the origins of human language, but one of the theories is that there is a Proto-Human Language from which all other languages are descended. However, because we don't have written forms going back nearly that far, it is extremely difficult to accurately reconstruct the language. Reconstructing that language would be based off of other Proto reconstructions, like Proto-Indo-European, and we can't even guarantee the accuracy of those reconstructions. It is somewhat likely that there is a single Proto-Human Language, considering that fact that all humans originated from the same area of the world. They then expanded out and the languages changed based on natural change and language contact to give us what we now have today. 

I don't think it would be exactly possible to pin down a certain inventory of vowels in your own idiolect because even then they can vary so much depending on the environment that they appear in. Take, for example, the vowel contrast of /u/ and /ʊ/. I can pronounce those just fine, and I can easily note the difference in the vowel between "book" /bʊk/ and "nude" /nud/. However, if you asked me to contrast between "pool" and "pull," which in Standard American English are /puːl/ and /pʊl/, respectively, I am physically incapable of pronouncing /puːl/. I pronounce both words as /pʊl/. And then there are all the influences on any given vowel, like nasalization before a nasal consonant, rounding because of the environment in which the vowel appears, etc. Saying three words that have the same vowel are still probably going to all be slightly different. This little gem from "lol, my thesis" basically sums it up: "It appears, based on experimental evidence, that vowel perception is pretty much magic." However, if you want to somehow try and compare your vowels relative to one another, the best way to do that is to download Praat, fire it up, and start recording. I have no resources on how to properly analyze frontness-backness or vowel height (sorry, I mostly use it for suprasegmental stuff), but it's a place to start. With that you could start comparing all the different vowels you can produce.
