Of course, Mole ends up being the one doing the packing, but the passage is still strongly suggestive that Rat is, at the least, capable of collecting his own food from his pantry. Additionally, from Chapter 2 we learn that Rat does do various household chores: 

The similarities are too many and too strong to be simple coincidences. I have to assume that Christie decided to base Hastings on Watson for one reason or another. Are there any writings by Christie that detail just which characteristics of Hastings she borrowed from Watson, and how those shaped his character in the Poirot novels he appeared in? 

The French Academy (Académie française) beats the Nobel with several prizes in the lists here, none of which are still running. I've only included the ones I'm sure are for literature (end dates from Wikipedia): 

In short, there's no evidence to back up Penzoni's story. I've found bits and pieces pointing towards another - more damning if it's true - possible target of plagiarism. I originally found them made in this blog and this blog. They state that a poet named Jefferson Tiberius Faulkmore wrote a poem entitled The Magpie in 1829, publishing it in The Hartford Cabinet of Literature & Science (supposedly later the Hartford Literary Journal), a year after his death. According to the stories, the story was brought to Poe's attention in 1842 by a man named Rufus Wilmot Griswald, and Poe wrote him a letter in return. It included this passage: 

There is no indication that the horse has any sentience; while it's not out of the question, there is nothing to suggest that it does. Methuselah, in his recollections of sightings of rat-induced mayhem in the period leading up Cluny's assault on the abbey, noted that several other farm animals had been attacked by the band (emphasis mine): 

Rand al'Thor's answer is excellent. It shows that we repeatedly see Holmes referring to Moriarty with grand language, supposedly placing him on a pedestal above all other criminals. At the same time, if we look at the backstory behind Doyle's writing of The Adventure of The Final Problem, we see cracks in the idea that Moriarty is really Holmes' arch-nemesis. I decided to go back through The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Return of Sherlock Holmes. I was curious to see how Holmes referred to other criminals he encountered. Let me go through some of them: 

What becomes clear is that Holmes uses these labels - especially the ones concerning the worst criminals in London - only relatively. Once Moriarty is gone, Moran becomes the most formidable. When Moran is caught, Milverton steps up. We see the title of "Most dangerous man in London" is temporary; indeed, each villain only rises briefly. For instance, we see as late as The Adventure of the Copper Beeches - not too long before The Adventure of the Final Problem - that London is apparently boring. As Holmes puts it, 

Barrett Browning wrote a passage in a letter shortly after her mother's death which is quite reminiscent of her later writing in Aurora Leigh (from Leighton's Elizabeth Barrett Browning, page 55): 

2 "Too Scottish" has been quoted all over the Internet, but it's extremely difficult to find an original source for it. The best indication I can get is from a 1936 letter from Blair to Norah Myles, in which he writes, "The Blairs are by origin Lowland Scottish & dull". That's the only thing I can find referring to his family's name's history and Scotland. 

4 Anonymous Speech: Literature, Law and Politics notes that it is possible that Blair considered "Orwell" while walking along the banks of the river with his father. References: 

At the same time, her memories explicitly contradict this, and Aurora knows that this was not her mother. She then writes that the woman could have been all those things, 

Phase 1: Start with short stories from the first two series. The classic Holmesian tale involves elements of deduction from seemingly nonexistent details, whether they be a piece of fabric or a burn mark. To understand the way Sherlock Holmes thinks, you need to read one of these to catch a glimpse of his methodology. Holmes is not just a man; he is a character for study, and his depth is what puts Doyle above so many other writers in detective fiction. He's inscrutable, irrepressible, and always unpredictable, and you cannot just pick up, say, The Hound of the Baskervilles and understand the complete persona of Sherlock Holmes. The short stories are, of course, the best place to start. In 20 or so pages, you can see an example of the sleuth's mind and personality, while getting to used to observing him work, through Watson. While there's no typical story, I'd recommend starting with one from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. A Case of Identity would be my pick, as it begins with some marvelous deductions by Holmes and ends with a resolution nobody could have seen coming - yet at that point, you see the pieces fall into place as clear as day. You might be tempted to start with the story published first in that collection, A Scandal in Bohemia. Don't. It is an outlier in the Holmesian saga, an unusual and compelling tale that I think is best appreciated only after you get to know the detective. It shows parts of his personality that are only rarely apparent elsewhere - love, even - and involves a case unlike any other. It is atypical, and while it might interest you, I'd recommend starting with something more ordinary. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes are rather similar in style, I feel, and so the stories can be read in various orders. There is extremely little overall plot change within them, and while in a certain story Holmes may reference past cases, they are largely self-contained. Doyle's style is roughly constant, if memory serves. This collection can be picked up and put down at any point. I would, however, advise reading The Final Problem last out of all of them - for continuity's sake - as you acknowledged in the question. It is perhaps one of the most important short stories in the initial arc. I also happen to like reading The Adventure of the Naval Treaty directly before this, because I love it, but it's not mandatory. Phase 2: Mix something else in - A Study in Scarlet or The Sign of the Four. After a while, you may get bored. Each short story will challenge you, but the format can get tiresome after 24 of them. I encourage you to try one of the longer standalone works. I would prefer A Study in Scarlet or The Sign of the Four, which go into Holmes' methodology in more detail and present a story arc - which you don't see as much in any of the short stories. Both of these books were published before any of the short stories, but they can be challenging to slog through. I'd wait until you're comfortable with the style before going on to these. I suggest mixing them in after reading perhaps ten or twelve short stories - or earlier, if you want. But read them in one sitting. Do not start one and then go back to the short stories. Confusion may follow. I also happen to think that there are many cases where reading a book from start to finish is the best way to appreciate it, and this is one of those times. Phrase 3: Go back to the new short stories. Note: Re-read The Final Problem, to refamiliarize yourself with it and see how the arc it begins evolves into the next series. Doyle, feeling extreme pressure by fans, brought Holmes back from the dead after killing him off - in a fashion many may know about, but which I'm not going to reveal. He eventually published The Return of Sherlock Holmes, another series of short stories. In my mind, these are worse than the original two collections (after all, there was an 11-year gap between this and the originals!). They feel forced, and the plots get ever more intricate, astonishing, sensational and, quite frankly, hard to believe. I find some unsatisfying; at any rate, I can tell the difference in style. Try to read these 13 together, as a group (start with The Adventure of the Empty House, Holmes' return). Don't mix them in with the other two collections; there's just something wrong. Maybe others disagree. At any rate, quality aside, I do feel like The Return of Sherlock Holmes was written with suspense in mind, not the pure intellectual investigation. My same criticism holds for His Last Bow and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes. However, I don't remember them all as clearly as I remember the first three series. Phrase 4: Finish up the novels. First, read The Valley of Fear. It's likely my least favorite of the four novels - again, I think suspense plays a bigger role than pure mystery - but it's still worth a read. I'd recommend reading it last, so you keep a rough chronological order for the novels, but I think it lacks a sense of closure. Finish off your Holmesian adventure with The Hound of the Baskervilles. Doyle wrote this to fight off the clamor of fans when Holmes was "dead", and so it was a throwback, in a sense, but it is quite self-contained. Doyle creates a unique cast of characters - none too hard to believe, in fact - and keeps suspense and intellectual mystery in a good balance. It does have a sense of closure, which The Valley of Fear does not, even though it is not part of the larger canon. It can be read apart from everything else, of course, but you really should know Holmes, in all his full glory, to appreciate his struggles in this book. 

Aurora has her eyes set things completely different. Her goals in life, her aspirations, rest on poetry, the way she can look "for the gods" and a better understanding of the world. Romney has different designs, and different beliefs as to what a female poet can and cannot do. The essay points to an early relationship between Barrett Browning and Hugh Stuart Boyd. There was clearly a disconnect between the two: 

My interpretation of this is that the Kraken will continue sleeping, but will finally rise at the end of the world and die majestically. We could take this at face value, but the reference to "angels" in particular seems to mean that Tennyson is referring to the apocalypse in a religious sense, and therefore the Kraken could represent a religious symbol. Additionally, I'm reminded of mythological parallels. For instance, the Norse Prose Edda includes Loki's escape from his bonds during Ragnarok and subsequent death in battle. There is also the case of Jörmungandr, who will also rise at Ragnarok. Tennyson's connection to mythology (admittedly, normally Greek and Roman) make me consider that there could be a tie-in here. Does the rise of the Kraken at the end of the world symbolize anything, and is it at all connected to something religious?
