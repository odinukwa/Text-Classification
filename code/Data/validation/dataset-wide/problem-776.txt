"Plate tectonics" have probably nothing to do with the composition and parameters of the present day atmosphere. As far as I know nobody had ever suggested that mantle can re-absorb gases from the atmosphere - on a contrary, gases released from a cooling mantle through a volcanic activity should contribute to a more denser atmosphere (clearly, this process never helped Mars and is not helping Earth that much either). Volcanic gases are mostly composed of CO2 and water vapor (up to 90% by mass), while those two substances are hardly present in the modern day atmosphere (CO2 - ~350ppm, vapor - 0.4%, mostly from evaporation unrelated to volcanic recycling). Comets are relatively lite objects (a decent comet weighs 10000-100000 times less that even a thinnish, present day Earthian atmosphere) with low density. High kinetic energy impact of a comet with a planet will most probably result in escape of the majority of comet contained gases back into space (and impact heating will also add some of the planetary gases to the escaping mix - a process known as "impact erosion"). It is long believed that no substantial matter transfer is possible between comets and planets ($URL$ "Early thin atmosphere" - atmosphere being eroded or lost shortly after Earth (Moon) formation is not plausible for the obvious reason: where does the limestone/coal comes from? If Earthian atmosphere was lost and then replenished through tectonic activity this brings us to back to an original question. 

There just aren't any other mechanisms to keep the population excited in a Stromgren sphere. In principle collisions can also lead to excitations, but if you do an order of magnitude calculation you'll find that the time between collisions is much longer than the time to receive an ionizing photon. In a laboratory setting you might be able to coerce some particles into remaining in an excited state using the Quantum Zeno effect, but that won't happen in interstellar space. So without something to keep the atoms in an excited state, even if you start with everything in the excited state, in time $\tau$ you will find that everything has decayed to the ground state, with the exception of some very small fraction $\tau_{\textrm{ion}} / \tau$, which may have moved up to a higher energy state. Assuming the lifetimes of those very excited states are comparable, after a few more times $\tau$, you will find that even those will have decayed to the ground state. 

Earth had formed with an atmosphere similar or denser than Venusian. Its most abundant ingredient should have been CO2 (analogously to Venus and Mars). Earthian atmosphere managed to cool down enough for water to start condensing into liquid phase. The exact mechanism for this is not quite clear to me (Goldilocks zone notwithstanding) because hot and dense CO2/H2O atmosphere should have caused a prominent "green house" effect, preventing the planetary surface from cooling down (unless "green house" effect models are too exaggerated). Atmospheric CO2 started to dissolve in liquid water (this alone would account for about 50% reduction in partial CO2 pressure). Strongly acidic water started to erode calcium from the crust, kick-starting the limestone formation process. Emerging life had accelerated the process, sequestering the remaining atmospheric CO2 into the gigantic limestone and somewhat smaller coal deposits. 

Based on a Simbad search, it looks like the most distant white dwarf is WD J0106-0014, which was measured in Debes et al. 2011 to be at 6442 pc. Here's the Simbad page: $URL$ 

Andy Gould proposed a classical derivation of Hawking radiation in a somewhat obscure paper from 1987. The essential argument is that a black hole must have a finite, non-zero entropy (otherwise you could violate the second law of thermodynamics with a black hole). Moreover, the entropy of the black hole must depend only on its area (otherwise you could change the area of a black hole via the Penrose process and lower its entropy and make a perpetual motion machine). If a black hole has an entropy and a mass, then it has a temperature. If it has a temperature, then it must radiate thermally (otherwise you could again violate the second law of thermodynamics). Of course, if you look at the Hawking radiation temperature, there's a Planck's constant in there, so it has to know something about quantum mechanics, right? But it turns out that it's actually thermodynamics in general that knows about quantum mechanics, not general relativity --- Planck's constant is only needed to keep entropies finite (and therefore temperatures non-zero). This is true of black holes and blackbodies alike. 

The most straightforward approach is to use a so-called Hertzsprung-Russell diagram: stars of a given mass "burn" in a fairly predictable way, so by looking at a star's spectrum and luminosity one can infer its possible age. $URL$ Wikipedia also has an overview of some additional methods: $URL$ 

The detailed outline of the theory can be seen here: $URL$ I hoped that some answer's here can suggest plausible alternative theories. In particular: 

Venus is somewhat lighter then Earth, yet has a much thicker atmosphere. One would imagine that the following should be true: 

First, one should observe that water is very abundant in the Solar system and most of it comes from before the planetary formation stage. Even Mercury has got its deal of water, albeit a small one. I think, it will be safer to assume that earth had had it water from the very beginning of its formation. Additional thing to consider are the temperatures, routinely reachable on various planetary bodies. Mars and everything beyond are way too cool for liquid water to exist, but solid water is present there in considerable quantities. Similarly, Venus and Mercury ended up with temperatures above point of water vaporization or even chemical breakdown in the presence of other compounds. Only the Earth happens to occupy a nice orbital zone where water can exist in all 3 phases (solid, liquid and vapor). But it's not something Venus has any effect on. 

The short answer to your question is no, there is not dark matter between galaxies, at least at any appreciable level. There is ordinary matter between galaxies, called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The IGM is an extremely dilute, hot gas that pervades the space between galaxies. The typical density of the IGM is about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter and its temperature is somewhere around 10^6 K. These high temperatures keep the IGM in pressure equilibrium with any galaxies and prevent it from collapsing onto galaxies. Dark matter, however, is cold, and lacks the pressure support of the gas in the IGM, so it condenses onto galaxies. [1] One interesting difference between dark matter and ordinary matter is that dark matter lacks any sort of cooling mechanism. As a result, when ordinary matter collapses onto a galaxy, it can cool and condense into a relatively compact space and later form stars and planets. The dark matter, however, remains extended because it has no way to shed its gravitational potential energy. Galaxies therefore exhibit a substantial dark matter halo, where the ratio of dark matter to ordinary matter increases substantially a few galactic radii away from the center. Within the galaxy itself, ordinary matter is dominant by at least an order of magnitude, but the density of ordinary matter falls off exponentially while the dark matter falls off only with the cube of distance, leaving dark matter dominant a few galactic radii away from the galaxy. One interesting question is whether or not dark matter halos exist in intergalactic space without a corresponding host galaxy at the center. As far as we can tell, the answer to that seems to be no, or at least, such structures must be quite small and exceedingly rare. There are dwarf galaxies (only 10^6 solar masses or so) which have enormous dark matter halos (much out of proportion to their size, relative to the Milky Way), but nearly every halo seems to have at least some ordinary matter present, no matter how feeble. Cosmic voids are an even more extreme example. Voids are dominated by dark energy and therefore expand more rapidly than the rest of the universe. Voids tend to push any matter (dark or otherwise) into walls that separate them from surrounding voids. In a real sense, the universe is made of voids, and everything we know lies on the walls and filaments that separate them. This paper examined dark matter halos in cosmic voids and essentially found that there weren't any. In other words, they found that dark matter halos in cosmic voids have host galaxies just as often as dark matter halos outside of cosmic voids (which is to say, almost always). [1]: To be absolutely pedantic, I wouldn't doubt that there are a few dark matter particles whizzing about in intergalactic space. But I would be surprised if its density exceeded the (already puny) density of ordinary matter in the IGM. 

1MW of transmitted power is very modest by RADAR terms, to give one example. Thus, you probably need to establish what exactly your professor means by "brightest" (may it be a specific wavelength or point in time, or some other definition). Otherwise, there's no reason to believe that Arecibo transmission was any special or outstanding from radio engineering stand point, while there were such nice toys operating at the very same time: $URL$ 

Yet, it is Earth that seemingly misses a great deal of atmospheric volume. So the question is: what are the current theories regarding the "thinning" of the Earthian atmosphere? When and why the atmospheric gases had left the planet? 

I don't know about names for the planets, specifically, but the orbits are called S-type and P-type: 

I'm not aware of any official (i.e., IAU) definition of a multiple star system. However, as someone who used to do research in that field, I would interpret multiple star system as encompassing systems with two or more stars. So a binary system, a triple system, and a quadruple system are all multiple star systems. 

Stars less than about 0.3 solar masses are fully convective, so hydrogen throughout the entire star can be transported to the core and consumed. At higher masses, the core is radiative, so only hydrogen that starts in the core is consumed. 

It so appears, there exist surprisingly little solid theories as to why Earth and Mars managed to lose the majority of their atmospheric gases, while Venus had managed to retain a most magnificent atmosphere. One plausible theory was put forward by a prominent chemist Octave Levenspiel et alii, based on the old Soviet research into Earthian crust composition conducted in the 1950s (I could not find any substantial updates to the crust composition model developed since that time). At a glance, the theory works as following: 

During the formation phase, all inner planets had captured as much gas as they could hold per gravitational/thermodynamic equilibrium. After all, even puny Mars managed to capture a sizable atmosphere. The rate of atmospheric escape should be much higher for Venus: 

It is indeed possible to measure the AU using transits of Mercury, and Edmund Halley tried to do just that in 1677. However, there are two advantages to a transit of Venus. The first is that during the transit, Venus is only 0.28 AU from Earth, whereas Mercury is about 0.7 AU away. This makes the parallactic effect twice as big. The second difficulty is that you need to measure the time between second contact and third contact (i.e., the first and last time that the planet is entirely in front of the Sun). Mercury is so small that it is hard to determine when second and third contact are. (In fact the limiting effect for the measurement of the AU during the transit of Venus was the so-called "black drop effect", which made it impossible to measure the times of second and third contact to a precision less than about ten seconds.) A former professor of mine from when I was in graduate school has a really excellent writeup of the history of these measurements: $URL$
