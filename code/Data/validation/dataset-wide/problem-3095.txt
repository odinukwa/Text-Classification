If I was a dark age soldier and I would have to carry a shield without having a purposely attached fastener, I would use a rope, tie it into handle, if the shield is moving, make a triangles around the shield to make it stable, and fix it on myself, like a backpack, maybe there are better ideas, this is my first one to try. Here is the illustration I made in paint: 

There was a period in Cuba "the sugar revolution" as it is called in Franklin W. Knight's review. Sugar industry includes large set of products, and between 1750-1850 there was a big explosion of demand for sugar. In the beginning of that period aristocracy used up most of the sugar, later in mid 19th century and especially somewhat later even the common people had enough purcashing power to buy some sugar related product. In this period Cuba also lost strict Spanish rule on export-import, and got independent from Spain, introduced and later abolished slavery, by these factors their economy could accelerate. By 1880's Cuba's sugar production almost entirely ended up in US (according to Wiki, however it is not cited). And we all know US was a serious emerging power in the region by that time. 

I wanted to comment, but an actual google search gave some sort of answer for me, maybe there will be better answers than mine, I see the practical side of the fastening problem. The handles are typically sort of "D" shaped where the straight side is the shield or some straps with two fixed points on the shield body having enough space between them for an arm or hand. The shape is ideal to apply independently from the shield any regular rope, leather strap to fasten it to your armour, or clothes and make it easily accessible. Let's see some examples: First picture is Arc d' Orange shield with handle. A strap would perfectly fit in, and could be used for fastening it to armour. 

Or they can come together, make rules as to how they are to survive as a group, which, whilst limiting each individual's freedom will free the community from domination. This Contract may include choosing some people as leaders - the Government - but the Government owes its validity to the community, not because it's richer, stronger, high-born etc. Each individual sacrifices some autonomy, for the good of, and strength in, the community. This is a very crude example, and others better versed in political science will probably be tearing their hair out (sorry!). But I just hope it might offer you a "way in" to the text. Hope it helps a bit. 

I would suggest the answer is "No" - and the aristocracy would not actually include gentry either. Social gradations at that time were subtle but strong, a wealthy "gentleman" would still defer to a peer, even if the peer were the poorer. Read Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope for examples. But royalty was in a different category, as, indeed, it is today; the tabloids might titter if a Duke were caught in a compromising position, but it would not be the headline news that a royal scandal would provoke. Also - and I stand to be corrected on this - the aristocracy's influence came from land (vast holdings in many cases) industry (they weren't above exploiting coal or other resources) and their power of patronage. Royals, to the best of my knowledge, lacked the first two - Parliament frequently was asked to bail out profligate Princes! And - a final touchstone - would a Duke, say, challenge a prince to a duel (rare occurrences but not unknown)? The answer is almost certainly not, such an act would be treasonable. 

Well, to be factual, more like 4100 years+ of history is available for study. Xia Dynasty is dated back to cca 2100 BC - 1600 BC, numerous sites approves these dates. Before these days dates and historical records get more and more inaccurate and entering into the realm of legends. "5000 years" seems more like a generous rounding up, but it is not very far from reality. 

To declare I don't have a definite answer, but with my answer I might get you somewhat closer to the ultimate method. To estimate a value back in time is especially hard because of the following factors: 

I decided to make an answer since I pointed out a lot of the issue, I deleted my comments, and I state now I don't have the historical evidence, but have a good view on practical use of arrow and bows. The arrow rarely breaks in the middle, most of the cases if it hits solid material, it breaks very close to or at the head. Both arrow's body and head is recoverable if it found. I agree with Felix Goldberg, the archers most probably didn't reuse the arrows in a single - unbroken - battle, since they had to keep formation and received orders. They might pick up the arrows only if it is there, pinned into the dirt and healthy (like they were targeted by enemy archers), but this is unlikely too, archers typically used against footmen and cavalry. Quote: "However, if I'm shooting arrows at guys wearing armor, then some of the ordinance will get damaged after use and not be reusable in "tomorrow's" battle." This is wrong, they can be repaired very easily. For me in a workshop it takes 5 minutes, with a proper tools and practice in the medieval age it would take similar length of time, it needs to glue together, which happens overnight. And I can tell, it is way easier and quicker just to repair your arrows than making new ones. A typical arrow is reusable 5-6 times until it gets shorter. If it gets too short: you need to make new body. If it is not sharp enough, just sharpen it. Sharpening with proper tools happens in minutes. I also want to point out, that there are no really huge collection of arrow heads in archeology, so it seems they were reused. My point would need confirmation from a person who really researches the battle histories. But I would assume the recycle of arrows were lot closer to 100% than 0% for the winner side. 

Mummies in the Roman period are known for their realistic facial portraits. According to a Wikipedia article about these portraits, "they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies," and their production "reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century." However, this article also emphasizes that relatively little is known about the final decline of earlier burial practices and that there were complex reasons involved. 

Any hunting depicted in medieval art is likely to be by members of the nobility, regardless of whether they are wearing armor or not. The website of the Metropolitan Museum of Art describes the use of armor for hunting as "rare". 

It is implied that Ruan may have been the family name of the bureaucrat who chose to give the subjected population the same name, although there is no direct evidence of this. In any case the point is that the name itself was basically arbitrary and probably didn't have any literal meaning of siginificance to the people who it was originally imposed on. As for how the name became so popular over time, this same article emphasizes a key point related to this arbitrariness: 

So claims that Jews were something like 40% of the party, which did circulate at the time, were pure fabrications. In Germany, Hitler and the Nazis pushed hard on the idea that Communism and other left wing ideas emerged from the supposed racial degeneracy of the Jews. I cannot find any hard numbers like the above to support the idea that Jews were in fact disproportionately represented in Germany's left wing parties. It must be said that none of this is objective evidence in support of anti-Jewish racism. Given the oppression faced by Jews in Tsarist Russia and the rest of Europe, it should hardly be surprising that they may have been a significant part of the base for left-wing movements. 

The declaration says the king of Ur, Sumer and Akkad is de-facto word of Utu, the Sumerian Sun God, therefore it passes as a regulation of authority of the king. 

I am curious if are there any wars still going on because of anomalies of diplomacy like the following examples: 

To be honest, I don't know the chances, but here are the following facts, hopefully they give good picture on topic: The continent was spotted by various people before James Cook - collected evidences are from the related wikipedia page's sources: K.G. McIntyre (1977) The Secret Discovery of Australia; Portuguese discoveries 200 years before Captain Cook. Souvenir Press, Medindie, South Australia The discovery is claimed by Portugal long before Portugal. An another claimant is a less known French sailor Binot Paulmier de Gonneville who stated that from the Cape of Good Hope (South-Africa) he sailed 6 weeks to east and hit a new coast, but the commonly accepted that he didn't reach Australia but nowadays Brazilia. Later Dutch sailors reached Australia, but the first one who took Australia seriously was Captain Cook, so they claimed the whole territory of Australia. Of course there were competitors. 

Take a note, France was involved to American freedom fight, had cultural renewal by Enlightment, and of course the 1789 revolution happened, then Napoleon focused all the resources to Europe, they even sold Louisiana to finance war. We can say, the focus wasn't on Australia in France to press any claims, so Great Britain had relatively a green light to do whatever they want there. 

It is pretty logical. Back in time there were no electronic, car and many industries, and the wealth - gold and silver - of the world arrived to Europe - mainly to nobles and kings. There was a big portion of extra wealth available to spend, and it was an interesting luxury item since those times the spices in foods were very limited in europe due to the climate. On the other side spice was a perfect commodity to transport. You needed to calculate in grams, not tons. Therefore you didn't need a huge fleet of ships to make a good business out of it. The price was maintained simply because of the risk, the long trip, and the fact the nobles are willing to waste the extra wealth on it. Also the prices were maintained by the big companies formed in these times: British East India company and the dutch one for similar purpose. The paid 40% dividend, and everybody was happy about it. And if I say everybody, I include customers too, spicing their food was a good sign if they are wealthy, which was obvious for their guests, when they learned they ate for example three spices from indonesian islands and india. 

This is purely anecdotal, but in her autobiography "The Past is Myself", Christine Bielenberg, an upper-class English woman married to a German doctor during the Third Reich, narrates her busband's experience of torture. Being on the fringes of the German resistance to Hitler, she says that they noted that when some activists were arrested, a slew of further arrests almost always followed, leading to great contempt for those who had apparently betrayed their fellow resistance workers. Her husband, Dr Pieter Bielenberg, was eventually arrested himself; as it was near the end of the war, with Germany facing certain defeat, Bielenberg was able to "name-drop" members of the British Establishment known to her to engineer his release. On his return, Dr Bielenberg confided to his wife that he would never again criticise anyone who "cracked" under torture, saying, (I quote from memory) - "You don't know what they can do to you!" As stated, this is anecdotal, but suggests that torture can be effective. $URL$ 

I am reading WILLIAM AND MARY by John Van Der Kiste 2008, 2011, in which he relates William III's reluctant plans to remarry after Mary II's death. This was to ensure the Protestant succession after Anne's death, as well as a future Stadtholder, particularly in view of the young Duke of Gloucester's precarious health. One of the "candidates" was Louise Dorothea Sophia, the daughter of Frederick of Brandenburg. Van der Kiste discusses the protocol when, in 1696,William travelled to the Rhine to meet Frederick and the prospective bride. Initially, neither Frederick nor William would sit down, each reluctant to take the only great armchair. Kiste goes on: 

A personal opinion, which I admittedly cannot back with sources atm, but I suspect it had as much to do with the "rise of the individual" during the Renaissance. Writers, artists etc are largely, though not entirely, anonymous before that. The Reformation emphasised personal salvation, an individual relationship with the Divine, and the individual, as opposed to the group, community, caste or class, began to step out of the shadows - cf Hamlet "What a piece of work is a man!" Earlier, the individual was simply not important, so why would s/he be painted? 

Second picture is a Viking shield replica. There you can see an applied strap for carrying/apply on the arm, but the handle here has enough space to put a rope or strap in it, so even without the applied strap, it would be easily attachable to anywhere. 

You can scan them for numismatically rare pieces, but depending on quantity most probably they worth a few hundred pounds, if any chance there is one or two rare note (limited availability) then more. As O.M. pointed out, the notes went through severe inflation, addition to this information, the notes were printed like there will be no tomorrow. That 100.000 Marks could be a single note or a nice stash of notes. Rare notes might be found by printing year or some characteristics (misprints). It requires a lot of research or some help from a local coin dealer. 

You can read the condemnation of Copernicus' theories yourself on the following link. I am sure others might have a better answer, but from my knowledge, there were three big centers of inquisitions in Europe: 

I assume your question is: Since People's Republic of China (PRC) exists, was Taiwan considered as part of it? It is more like a political question than historical, since the current situation of PRC and ROC (Republic of China) is still unsettled since the end of the civil war. I am sure most of us know that People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, but it is de-facto independent country. So in a way Taiwan is part of PRC. Importantly on the other hand maybe less people know that ROC renounced in 1992 the conquest of PRC-controlled territories as a national goal, there is still dispute over whether the constitution still gives legal support to a claim of sovereignty over all of China's pre-1949 territories, including Outer Mongolia and the entirety of the present PRC. From Wikipedia So in a way PRC's territory belongs to ROC as well. Objectively, these two territories function as separate countries. Separate governments, currency, foreign relations. Taiwan's independence is recognized by various countries, and most of countries have unofficial relationship with Taiwan (without embassy), but there are couple of countries have completely official foreign relationship with Taiwan including embassy. Taiwan's de-facto independence is reinforced by USA through Taiwan Relations Act accepted in 28th February 1979. So the answer is "yes and no in the same time", entirely depends on political view. Also answer is no for practical way, they both do function as two separate countries.
