You are mixing two assertions. One is that many pushups doesn't require a lot of strength and another is that it doesn't build strength. The first is false but the second is kind of true. The stronger you are, the easier it gets and thus the more you can manage. If you can bench press 100 kg then it'll be very easy to rep out with just a 20 kg bar. However, if you're 1RM is 30 kg then you'll struggle going beyond 4-5 repetitions. A high-repetition scheme does build some strength but is far inferior to low-rep/high-resistance in that regard: 

Stretch jeans! Also has the added benefit of highlighting the results of your leg work. ;) Other than that, get a pair that fits your upper legs and take them to a tailor for adjustments. 

It will, up to a point. If you can only do 5-10 straight reps before having to break then it's still heavy enough to build decent muscle for you. Once you can do around fifteen or more in a row, however, it'll start to become decreasingly effective. 

You will burn pretty much the same amount of calories running 1 kilometer really fast, as lightly jogging the same distance. When it comes to movement the distance is what decides how much energy you'll burn. Running the 1 km will, however, be much faster than the light jog. If you only have half an hour to train you'll be able to squeeze more kilometers into that session if you move faster – thus burning more calories. You might tire more quickly when going too fast, forcing you to rest and netting you less distance in the end of the session, than if you'd paced yourself. It sounds bad but this intensive training will increase you aerobic capacity over time and enabling you to go longer and faster as time goes by. This will let you burn more calories over the long term. Short term – go only as fast as you can maintain movement throughout the whole training session. Long term – mix it up with high intensity interval training to increase your aerobic capacity. 

There are number of articles saying some hip flexors inflexibility cause stress on spine and hence cause pain in lower back due to crunches or leg lift or even squats. What can i do as exercise which will prevent my back from injury due to performance of these exercise? please suggest safe exercise which wont need an expert to do correctly. As i understand hip flexor and extensor weakness is responsible for Psoas major activation, but to strengthen flexor extensor more pressure will come on Psoas. It is becoming a catch39 situation.

I am doing shoulder shrugs, I can do 66 pounds, but that is max weight available. My question is can i use barbell like dumbbells and do side shrugs or does weight being far away from center will affect exercise. In barbell weights are far away from center hence more torque while with dumb bell less torque so would not it be hard to do shrugs with barbell 

I was doing this inclined curl source What i found that i could curl 25 pound with normal curl but with incline curl I can do only half of that, what is reason for decrease in strength ? 

I am doing barbell shrugs as dumbbells has maxed out, but i am finding doing same weights with barbell is bit difficult as compared to dumbbell as my hands are in front. Is there any science behind it? 

I had lots of injury in gym and I kept hearing it is because of bad form. I am sure i was doing correct form in half of them. Does proper form never cause injury? 

I am doing bicep curls standard nothing special, But I don't feel muscle soreness in middle of biceps, i fell it near lower end of it, near elbow one. is it normal or am I doing curls wrong? 

I saw this exercise and i cant remember where but it is a chest exercise, You lie down on floor, put dumbbell on your chest, grab it firmly with both hands in middle and raise it to top and them back again to chest and so on. I this exercise legitimate and is it effective for chest? 

Generally it's much easier to, for example, skip eating a banana than to go out jogging for fifteen minutes. Personally I feel it's even more so when your caloric deficiency is more than 500 kcal per day. This is all just anecdotal, so I'd try it out myself if I were you. But for myself I'd just do some heavy lifting to maintain muscle and then cut the bulk of the calories at the intake instead. 

Sweating is your body's way of cooling down and it has nothing to do with burning calories. If you wanted to measure that you'd look for how much and hard you're panting – that's the fat oxidising away. The amount of sweat can very a lot from person to person and not sweating during a workout is of course okay but I'd question if you'd really gone as hard as you could have. 

I was in the same situation a year or so after starting working out. It just plateaued. Though I will say it's easy to think your progress has stalled, when in fact you just don't measure it. Get a caliper for your body fat, measure tape for circumferences, a scale for bodyweight, weekly photos and record that. The biggest bang for your buck is in your diet. If you haven't given it a lot of thought before you will see incredible results after cleaning it up. There's many, many ways to go about it and you'll have zealots for every one of them, proclaiming their superiority. However, they all work because they force you to control your intake and be conscious about what you eat. My recommendation would be to eat lots and lots of veggies (biggest portion of your plate) and make sure you get around 2 gram of protein per kilo bodyweight (whether that's from legumes, nuts, grains, meat or egg – that's up to you). Measure the food! Put it in a food log like MyFitnessPal. That's the only way you will know your intake and you should not skip this step. Next is exercise. If you can't squat twice your bodyweight I would switch to a beginners strength program with linear progression. My personal favorite is StrongLifts but some people like Starting Strength too. The important part here is the built-in progressional load – it keeps pushing you to lift heavier and heavier, thus helping you break through plateaus. Add in 5-10 minutes of intense Tabata as often as you feel you can still progress. Sprints, rower, skipping rope, etc. Go as hard as you can for 20 seconds and then slower for 10. Rinse and repeat.
