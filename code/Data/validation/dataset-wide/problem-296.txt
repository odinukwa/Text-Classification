Problems associated with all of these plants: they're all clones, so there's no genetic diversity. If some disease comes in that they're vulnerable to, they're all vulnerable to it (modern bananas currently have this problem). It's only a matter of time before some disease sweeps through, and it will be very difficult to repopulate after such a disaster (since no local seed production). Other avenues: 

My first thought was something like a whale evolved up, but that doesn't make much sense; in the ocean, once you're big you typically keep doubling down on size. Rather, I'd think something like a small lizard would be the base creature. It started growing larger as a defense mechanism, and storing hydrogen in sacks on its back to keep itself light. Eventually, it largely abandoned the ground, floating lazily through the air, pushing itself from branch-to-branch. During this time, it underwent radical structural changes. It's front legs evolved into webbed, stubby wings, while it's back legs and tail elongated to reach below. The hydrogen sacks became more and more pronounced, until it no longer needed to touch the ground at all. It's tail split several times, giving it a mass of tentacles that reach down, catching onto treetops or bringing up food and water. It's mouth dropped lower than it's front legs, and grew wider, straining the bugs out of the air like a whale strains krill. Still, it grew larger and larger. Some of its hydrogen sacks became too large to support with its circulatory system, so it stopped supporting them. Once a hydrogen sack gets old enough, it's sealed off and abandoned. It remains within the mass of the floating island, but is no longer a living part of it. The top-most layers routinely rupture, venting hydrogen into the air, and leaving a decomposing flesh bubble, which eventually turns into a kind of soil. In this soil, plants began to grow. It's larger than a blue whale now. Small plants and animals live on top. The roots of the plants reach all the way down, through the cruft on its back, and hook directly into its circulatory system. The plants get water from the creature, and in return pump oxygen directly into its blood stream. It no longer needs lungs, and develops a distributed heart network to pump blood throughout its body. It's massive now, five, ten, twenty times the size of the largest blue whale. Much of it, however, is old-mass, not living mass. It lives high in the air, just below the tree line. It's back is covered in alpine firs, aspen groves, small mammals, birds, and insects. The plants provide all it's energy needs. It provides the plants their mineral and water needs. Its mouth has changed, looking more like a circular set of gills than a real mouth. With this, it still strains insects out of the sky. It floats a careful line: if it stays too close to the ground, the plants on its back will grow too large and sink it out of the sky. If it floats too high, the plants will die in the cold and it will suffocate. Storms are its greatest enemy. Storms... and them... 

They're here because of massive, global climate change on Mars. It's possible that the Tharsis Mountains on Mars used to emit massive amounts of H2O and CO2 into the Martian atmosphere, potentially even covering nearly the entire planet in over 100 meters of water. But, the volcanoes are much less active now, and the water doesn't have a proper water cycle like on Earth. So, the Martians have been slowly retreating with the poles, following the small remaining amount of water as their world slowly becomes inhospitable to them. But, they're certainly not technologically inactive. Oh, no. They've got a space program with one single goal: fly to Earth and forcefully colonize it. We're even making it more attractive to them by increasing CO2 atmospheric concentrations. As soon as they get here, they'll probably start burning down the jungles to accelerate atmospheric CO2 increases. And, of course, you can't let those monkeys with delusions of grandeur ruin your plans. So blast their population centers until there's only small pockets of resistance remaining. 

Okay, okay, you specifically asked about "complex/precision" tasks such as programming and graphic/industrial design. Graphic/industrial design is easy: you want a pen-enabled touch screen. A big one. Pens not only give you pixel-perfect precision, but removes the barrier of the mouse concept for a more direct interface. As a software engineer, I really can't imagine anything better than a keyboard and mouse for programming. That being said... I've been using them for so long, that at this point it's just a personal block I have. As an author, I can't imagine anything better than a keyboard and mouse for writing, yet Terry Pratchett wrote most of his final books with his voice. While it would certainly require a very special programming language and IDE, I could certainly see people using voice to program (other people, not me; I really can't get into voice controls for my GPS, let alone programming). But, about that mouse... I haven't seen a desktop computer in quite a while. And if we're talking laptops, pretty much all laptops come with either a touchpad or the "nubbin", and not a mouse, to control the on-screen pointer. Many people no longer bother with a proper mouse anymore. And if you're concerned about speed and precision with either of those, that just means you're not an expert in them; people who do use them exclusively are just as good as you are with a mouse. Some people don't even use mice. I've even heard arguments that the mouse/keyboard combination is slower than pure keyboard input (though I'm sure that's entirely dependent on the person). The most interesting barrier seems like it's going to be how to get large blocks of text accurately into a system. An argument could be made about the difficulty of speaking special characters for programming, but I don't believe that to be true. If we had, for instance, a pure voice method of programming, we would design programming languages conducive to that format. After all, if Ook! is a language... Anyway. Could voice replace hands for lengthy text inputs? It certainly seems possible. Speaking is something that basically everyone does, while keyboard use is driven entirely by technological restriction and necessity. As voice controls get better, fewer and fewer people will use keyboards (other than specialists). And once voice gets good enough, even the specialists will probably switch over. 

Highly reflective In addition to providing their own light, to get a flickery, fire-looking effect you want them to also be reflecting the light of the other spores. Instead of being a simple static glow, having each spore sport a number of shifting reflective planes will give you a much closer approximation to a floating ball of flickering flame. Gliding ability The spores are going to be too small and mechanically simple to properly fly. But! Their light weight and some well designed fixed wings could give them the ability to glide for quite some time. This will help keep them up in the air as a "will-o'-wisp". Attraction to the swarm A quickly dispersed cloud of spores is, frankly, useless. Like throwing shiny dust in a high wind. We want a coherent mass. And that's why we need an attractive force. Not too attractive, or we'll just have a big ball of spores that falls directly to the ground. Which means we have to sporadically generate static electricity. The random static pulses will pull the swarm together briefly, then it will all begin to drift apart again. This will repeat as the swarm slowly drifts to the ground. The fox fire will collapse and become a bright point, then disperse and become a faint misty glow. 

There's an interesting property of liquid-filled shells (such as a watermelon) where, if you shoot it, the liquid going out the far side causes the base object to jump toward the shooter. Penn and Teller demonstrate this (warning: while they're shooting a watermelon, the context is about JFK getting shot in the head). You'll notice that the watermelon doesn't jump very far. So, applying the same principles to the Earth, a high-speed invincible object traveling north pole-to-south pole would cause a small entrance hole, and an explosive exit hole. Much of the southern hemisphere and the liquid core would be flung into space away from the northern hemisphere. The explosive force would propel the still mostly solid northern hemisphere "up", which would not endanger other planets in the system, particularly since it wouldn't be very far. The northern hemisphere would then start collapsing in on itself until it once again formed a sphere, even bringing back some of the flung off parts of the southern hemisphere. The parts of the southern hemisphere that don't rejoin the planet would likely either coalesce into a second moon or combine with the existing Moon. This isn't too different from how the Moon formed. The real problem here is atmosphere. Between the suction vortex of an object travelling that fast and the explosion of the southern hemisphere, much of the atmosphere would be lost. Then, with the reduced gravity of the remaining pieces, more atmosphere would be lost, particularly as what remains "flows" into the cavity left from the exited core. Pockets of atmosphere would probably survive in large basins, but it's likely any survivors have only hours to supply their own breathing air, and not much longer to get off planet before things really go wrong.
