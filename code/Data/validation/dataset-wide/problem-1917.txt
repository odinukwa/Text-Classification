Anytime you cancel there are repercussions. You are willing to throw away a job based on a technical glitch. If you tell them the reason they may pass your concerns on to management, but it is either a short term problem, or a long term problem that they have been ignoring. I would not have any expectation that your situation is the straw that breaks the camels back, thus spurring IT to resolve the issue. What will be the repercussions? For a period of time you will not be likely to get a job there. Will this hurt you? No way to know. It depends on what glitch causes you to abandon the next company. Because there is no master database of job offers that all companies can see, it is unlikely that it will hurt your chances with other companies. They may also look at your quick rejection of the company as a sign that they dodged a bullet. Your lack of patience (their view) was a sign you would have run into issues with their bureaucracy. Keep in mind that in the future you will not be able to tell this story as part if the chit chat during an interview because it will not paint you in a positive light. 

The last time I was looking for a job, I decided that one avenue I would use to search would be one of those companies that tries to put people into positions where they may eventually be hired as a full time employee. What I discovered was that the rates they wanted you to bill them were only a few dollars an hour above the rate you needed to match what you saw as gross pay in the previous job. They did this by implying that the extra would cover the benefits you needed to cover: insurance, social security. Of course those benefits were only the tip of the iceberg. They didn't cover holidays, vacation days, time between contracts... In the United States the cost your employer would charge a customer for your time is 2X the hourly rate they pay you in salary. That covers your pay, your benefits, their costs, their overhead and a decent profit. In the situation where I was looking, the recruiting company was also tacking on a fee to the customer. If you want to do this long term: be your own company. Expect to have to charge something in the range of 2x your salary rate. You can go lower if your costs are lower: no office rent, insurance from your military retirement or your spouse. Otherwise the rates they are suggesting will only be enough to fill part of the hole in your income, which might be enough to last until you can find a full time job. 

Apply now. Don't ever wait. I have seen job ads open for just a day. Others can be open forever because they always know that they need low level employees. I have also had ones where there wasn't a deadline. They kept it open until day x or until they had 10 people worthy of an interview. if there is a link follow it. It might tell you the deadline. Other times the link will tell you the deadline is passed and won't give you a chance to apply for that job, but will let you know about other openings in the company. 

The actual day that coverage ends is dependent on the company. It could be the end of the month or it could be on your last day of work. I even knew of one company that covered you for a few weeks because they owed vacation pay. Keep in mind that other benefits will end at the same time such as transportation / parking. Make sure you submit everything quickly so you can get reimbursed as quickly as possible. Pay attention to the balance in your medical and child care savings account. You don't want to leave money on the table, and you don't want to overdraw. The last day of coverage will be the last day of work. Though you will be able to submit bills for a few weeks after your last day. They should continue the 401K match for the last paycheck, and may even apply it to any vacation hours they pay. You might want to adjust your contribution rate depending on the program of your new employer. Remember that the maximum contribution counts all your contributions across all employers. 

The idea that the company or employee is to track the hours so it can be used to level the workload makes it sound like a administrative nightmare. It also means that the employee knows that management is tracking the time, and that management decides what projects are worth playing with. If it didn't sound like fun, or at least less stressful compared with the other projects, I would not be interested in it. 

As a way be noticed by another method of searching for candidates it is fine. Just don't avoid the other methods: posting on job sites, LinkedIn,.... Keep in mind that you will still need to have the ability to submit that information as a PDF or other document, and you have to be able to enter that information onto the corporate website when you formally apply. In some of these cases the info has to be presented in a very flat unexciting way, make sure the conversion doesn't take a lot of effort. The info that you must include is a mechanism for them to contact you. You must also have a contact system that will allow them to provide their contact info to you. Including your phone number would be a bad idea because it can be scraped and then the stream of calls unrelated to jobs would be annoying. If you give an email address it must be one that is permanent, but not vital to your life - that way all the spam and increased traffic can be easily dealt with. 

Differing hardware complicates support. They require different drivers, patches, and expertise. In even a small company this can quickly become a pain. Over time they will be forced away from a single platform, to multiple platforms during the life time of the machines, but they still want to keep the options to a minimum. Limiting hardware and software to a small list of options also allows the company to get volume discounts. It also allows the IT department to quickly configure a replacement machine when one is needed. Most companies expect that hardware costs will be X dollars per employee every 3-4 years, not x/4 dollars every year. 

Decide that the money crunch is reality for at least the near term. Determine how you will address those shortfalls with minimal (or zero funds). Determine what disasters can be lessened or mitigated in that environment. Don't bad mouth the company or a part of the company. Your manager told you to stop. Now try and become a productive part of the company without being a complainer. 

In the large companies this is not an uncommon for employees to want to transfer. Sometimes it is to switch job titles, sometimes to switch projects, and sometimes to switch work locations. In many cases this process is started without the current management knowing. First of all make sure you are allowed to switch. Some companies restrict movement for 6 months or a year if you just moved or were given a promotion. If your annual review is coming up discuss it then. Don't say you want to switch parts of the company, but talk about options within his department, or within his bosses department. Talk about things that can happen in the next year or two. Investigate how the company hires from within. Many companies have a career development site on their intranet. Most hiring mangers will not alert your current boss in the first few stages of the process. Sometimes you can be matrixed to another part of the company for a project. Your current boss is still your boss, but for the duration of the project you support the new project. That can be viewed by the other organization as an audition. Eventually if they see your potential they will ask for you to make the switch. You can tell your current boss that helping the new project will help the company, increase profits, and impress the customer. To find these possibilities use your network of friends within the company to look for positions that may only exist for 6 months or so. You don't have to tell your current boss that you applied. If the system is setup to allow bosses to fire employees that applied for internal positions the odds are that the organization will always have a lot of turnover, and not for the right reasons. 

The professional social media sites are a way for you to to stay in contact with the current and former coworkers. Because most people don't use it the same way they use the non-professional sites, most companies don't have a policy about posting your resume on the site. Your previous company knows you left. They either fired you, laid you off, or you resigned. The new company knows you joined them. I have yet to see somebody bad mouth a former company via LinkedIn, most just update their current employer, change the date for the most recent company and move on. I wouldn't use these sites to let your manager know you are leaving, but I don't see a problem with updating the information after the last day with the old company, or on the first day with your new company. Why would you want your employment history to be months out of date? If I knew you left one company but didn't update the info, I would assume you were no longer using the site. 

One way to find out if these help is to ask the placement office at the university. They may know what companies or government agencies are hiring which options. If none of the options appeal to you, ask the department if you can create your own minor/specialty. Some schools allow this. Also some schools require some majors to declare a specialty or concentration. These options can help if you know what you want to do after graduation. It can also hurt if HR can't see past the words on the paper. They are looking for a degree in A with a specialty in Y, and you have a degree in A with a specialty in ~Y, since it isn't an exact match they reject you. After a few years these options aren't nearly as important. Employers are more interested in what you have done on the job, not in a class room. 

You will have multiple issues: 1) everybody else will be doing things on windows. So you are taking on the obligation to make sure that it appears seamless. If they use outlook then you can't miss a calendar invite because your choice of tool doesn't work with it. If they are using windows based tools to manage the development then your tools have to work with them. 2) IT and security have to agree. You will be hooking a machine they don't control to their network. For many places that would be a show stopper. They might insist that it be air gaped, which defeats the requirement for seamless. 3) They will not want to pay for any software or tools that you need to run on your hardware. They have given you a machine, they are spending time patching the OS and tools. They may have a company wide license for their tools, and don't want to spend additional money on your tools. 4) You might have to show that you are running all the anti-virus tools to their level of satisfaction. I have worked in an office where several developers felt that running their favorite version of Linux was the only way they could work. In the end it wasn't worth the hassle. There was nothing but problems. They couldn't use the tools the rest of the team was using. They had problems working with the tickets. They had browser issues. They had calendar issues. They had email issues. They had file format issues. It seemed that they spent 25% of their time converting between the two operating systems. You need to decide what you want to do if they don't like your plan to bring in your own machine. If I was your management, I know that I would be wondering how this issue didn't get discovered during the hiring process. If I was aware of your level of insisting that real development can't be done with our tools, and you are still in the probationary period, I would start to look at how how quickly I can get our second choice on board. 

First of all before applying for the position you have to understand if the position is unpaid intern, low paid intern, or full-time paid position. Based on the fact that you feel that you are a perfect match for the technology, and you have a degree; you may even be able to defend that you deserve a little more than the minimum salary in the range they are offering. If it is an internship you will not be able to do much to change that. They have a need and they have a budget. If the salary you need doesn't fit in that budget bucket, they are unlikely to pay you what you would like. You would be asking them to overpay for the level of effort they are looking for. The position you want may not be open for months, or it may never be open with the company. If the job posting doesn't clearly mention that it is a full-time paid position, then ask before applying. Or apply, and ask at the first opportunity such as the phone interview. 

The $10K range is mostly immaterial. The thing they care about is the lower end of the scale. That is the number that you stated in your opening offer that you could live with. If you said $110K to $120K and they offer you $105K they are hoping they can negotiate you down. If you counter with $115K they see that your 2nd request went up, it didn't go down. That means they expect your second number can only be in the range $105K to $110K. If they had asked for a $20K range you should have stated $minimum to $minimum+20K where $minimum would have been the same as the bottom of the $10K range. The only thing they will use the top of the range for is to know the number that will make you instantly accept. If you said $110 to $120 and they offer you $119K they expect you will say yes. You may even forget to study the benefits, so you might not ask for an extra vacation or a company car; or try to find out how high they were willing to go. 

I was able to find a FAQ for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California: 

You are elevating Alice above co-worker, but still anchoring the relationship as work based. If over the years the friendship remains after one leaves the company, or if the outside of work friendship grows, then adjust your introduction. 

Most companies expect to have to spread the interviews over a few days or a few weeks. If you were still in school they would realize that class requirements can trump interview times. If you are currently in another job they realize that you have commitments to the other job. If you are unemployed, they realize you might have other interviews. Once you agree to a interview time, don't switch it, especially because a more desirable option wants to interview you. You have no idea before an interview which one has a better chance of offering you the position. Picking a date/time is a simple negotiation, but it is not a test. 

Your managers predicament is exactly why I never expect an honest review from the current manager. There is incentive to want to keep good employees and get rid of bad employees. Your situation is that you don't want to hurt your reputation with the old team. Telling the truth will keep a bad developer on your team. You best option is either to say that you haven't worked with him enough to be able to definitively say, or to only point them in the direction of potential areas that need closer review. Unless you have been there a long time you may not know why they don't react well to code changes. I worked at a place where there was a history of blaming the original writer of code even when the problems were clearly the result of changes by others. It wasn't uncommon to see the developers that had been there a while spend time each week reviewing all code changes to make sure that the new changes were not destroying old functionality. I would be hesitant to make any recommendation to the old team. Many corporations will only state that a person has worked for the company during a defined period of time. They will not comment on how good of an employee they are. They don't want a current or former employee to be able to say that they told lies about them. If I worked for the hiring company I would not hesitate to tell the hiring manger what I thought about a person I worked with in the past. I have done so in the past and would temper it by saying it was several years ago that I worked with them. But I would not feel comfortable about telling a former company about the performance of a current coworker. If the coworker find out you didn't give them a good recommendation, I would expect that that any hope of a good working relationship with them was gone. You could also open your current company up to a complaint from the employee. They were trying to avoid by the situation by only giving neutral facts, but you didn't follow that guidance. I would push the old team to contact the current manager, and leave it at that.
