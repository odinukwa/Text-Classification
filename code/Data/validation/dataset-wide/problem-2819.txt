Here I'm talking about the idea of mystery in a religious context to make the point that human consciousness can be deemed miraculous, where miraculous is used without the normal religious context. What I am really meaning here by mystery is something that is never completely knowable, and appears miraculous. I suspect it relates to inescapable nature of subjectivity in our everyday phenomenal reality: no subjectivity, no self. 

I think you have to look to psychology for this. (Matter and anti-matter are defined by equal but opposite charges. Humans are much more complex than elementary particles so you aren't going to find the exact opposite of the self that can be precisely quantified and proven to be perfectly symmetrical.) However, Jung introduced the concept of the shadow, which is in conflict with the conscious ego. I'd take it a step further and use the term nemesis in the sense of an agent that acts in opposition to the self. This utilizes the idea of the will, which implies intent, a quality that is only possessed by conscious beings. The intent of the nemesis is counter to that of the self. 

It sort of sounds like you're getting stuck on the numerical expression, which is subjective because Pi is also 11.00100100001111110110... and 3.243F6A8885A308D313198A2E0... [See π in Different Bases] This is a little bit outside of my field, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say Pi is not arbitrary, but is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to it's diameter, always. When I googled "arbitrary" in relation to Pi, I came up with many results, but none suggesting that Pi itself is arbitrary. Possibly I am misunderstanding arbitrary in the context the context you are using it... 

I find another useful way to look at it is in the context of Conway's Game of Life, where the game is an analogue for a universe. The discrete cells in the automata only have limited information based on spacial position, with hard limits on communication speed (analogous perhaps to c). The only entity that comprehends the entire system is the system itself, which may be taken as a commentary on Laplace's Demon. Rationality is bounded, and always subjective, except in the case of the model, which is itself a rational system. 

It doesn't seem difficult to determine the appropriate nature of our mind-to-world intentional states. Their appropriate nature is that they match accurately and precisely to the world, perhaps maximally so (except where perhaps this doesn't infringe excessively on most others' privacy). It feels as if this is an obvious and undeniable logical definition. However, it seems much more difficult to determine the appropriate nature of our world-to-mind intentional states. Their appropriate nature is... what? While one good first answer might be that their appropriate nature is that they reflect end-states that already have well-defined routines for satisfying them, we know this answer comes up short. We regularly see people solve problems that at least in large part had no known well-defined routines for satisfying them. This meant that they posed a problem that hadn't been posed exactly like it before (or finally solved one that had been such an open problem). What exactly is the permissibilic mechanism for people to pose unique (previously unsatisfied) problems, unique world-to-mind intentional states? Sometimes people pose unique problems and other people like them for it, and sometimes people pose unique problems and other people hate them for it. Many people act as though they have a thoroughgoing familiarity of the permissibilic mechanism, that here too there's an obvious and undeniable logical definition in effect. But where's the manual – or what is it like – on the necessary and sufficient constraints on posing previously unsatisfied problems, on formulating previously unsatisfied world-to-mind intentional states? 

By assuming the negation of the conclusion, you arrive at a proposition that contradicts a true premise. (We assume our premises are true when the validity, and not the soundness, of the argument is in question. If the soundness were in question then we would also want to know if the premises really are true, but the soundness is not in question right now.) If ~B leads to a contradiction, then it must be false. In classical logic, if ~B is false then B is true. What if we have all true premises and don't arrive at a contradiction by the same method? 

Marxism, well-intentioned but difficult to apply via human agents, particularly in pre-"information age" societies, was, in part, about reducing economic disparity. Social liberalism has the same core motivation, with the emphasis on social normalcy, as opposed to material equality. 

Which would seem to be a different type of indeterminacy than those arising out of observational limitations. 

On a related subject, from a terminological standpoint, I'd be very interested in people's thoughts on this question: Are games involving uncertainty truly quantum games, or merely representation of ideas arising out of quantum mechanics? 

Probably "what seems reasonable", although this itself is highly subjective, as demonstrated by the great gulf between what factions in the US consider "reasonable". There are issues with journalism to be sure. For instance, any coverage of the national debt that only mentions the size of the debt is an abuse of statistics, because the number is meaningless without the context of currency values, interest rates, percentage of GDP, etc. Nevertheless, the purpose of Journalism, similar to science, is to report on events/phenomenon is the most objective manner possible. (True objectivity is impossible within any given system, including what we call "reality", but that does not negate the legitimacy of the goal. Thus reasonable analysis of data and application of confidence levels in interpretations is critical.)* Based on Mr. Mooch's own admission, it is quite reasonable to assume he used vulgarities in reference to this or that person. By contrast, one might be more skeptical of similar hearsay in regards to President Obama, because he doesn't have a track history of public profanity, but might be more open to the hearsay that someone "saw the former President sneaking a cigarette on the patio at the Country Club," because he documented as having this habit early in his presidency. Part of the problem is that critical faculties differ with each individual, and the embracing of one's biases, which can be a tool, seems rarely tempered by questioning of one's assumptions. The issue partly relates to the hegemony of subjectivity, which is sometimes abused to cast doubt on scientific positions. (The idea that "evolution is just a theory" demonstrates unequivocally that speaker possesses not even the most basic grasp of what science is per their misunderstanding of "theory", equated in this case with what is known as an "hypothesis".) So, despite the addage that "Opinions are like #ssholes--everyone's got 'em", not all opinions are equally valid, because some "opinions" are supported by evidence. 

It can be done in one step. The first man sees two white hats and says that he knows. But, you say, the problem says that the first man says "I don't know"? Exactly. The problem's definition is also specified by the second man saying "I don't know." Therefore, if you can break the definition of the problem for your two steps, I can break the definition of the problem for my one step. ... 

I can see the power behind the argument because to get around it a person would either have to stretch the imagination into areas that might seem implausible or have to solve a lot of academic problems, if the person is to be satisfied that Mary has all the facts and that all the facts are physical facts. Foregoing the route of solving a lot of academic problems for now, I think we can continue to think about Mary in a way that derives directly from your formulation, RECURSIVE FARTS. The original Mary is characterized with the standard scientific kind, as having descriptive knowledge. If it's implied that she has procedural knowledge, which standardly tends to be an engineering kind, it's not very much. In domains where descriptive knowledge is enough, interfacing with things around you tends to be enough. You don't need to begin an approach to knowing the inner workings of things to the extent of knowing how to reconstruct them or something like them. That is, you don't need to begin an approach that's pointed to knowing things in themselves. At most, you'd need to know enough to create simulations, which, while a lot of times very sophisticated, is not the same. But descriptive knowledge isn't always enough in all domains where physical knowledge is required. Additional knowledge is required to assemble basic components (which are usually for larger systems). Without getting into whether or not Mary has the "right kind" of knowledge about colors, we can already say she lacks some physical knowledge. That is, she doesn't know how to assemble basic components. Or, at least, she doesn't have the facilities to assemble basic components and gain the knowledge of herself going through the process of assembling the basic components. Indeed, this would be just like you said, this would be a posteriori knowledge, RECURSIVE FARTS(). Now that we may begin to question the sobriety of the original caricature of Mary, we may be able to close in on settling the issue. Even letting alone the question of the life-changing subjective quality of strolling through the wilderness, we know that as it stands Mary neither has enough knowledge ab intra nor has enough knowledge a fortiori. However, provided proper education and further facilities, whether industrial or surgically integrated with her body, she would simply demonstrate her sufficiently complete knowledge of the physical world. First she would make basic nanoconstructors. Then she would make physical replicas of everyday inanimate objects. Then she would make physical replicas of archaea. (...) And finally, for now, she would give you a neural implant to complement hers for bidirectional communication of art works and anything else that could be seen in virtual reality. Of course, the tests she had to perform to get such magic right must've involved having knowledge of the physical world to such a degree that it went much beyond descriptive knowledge, and into its superset of acquaintance knowledge. Having physical descriptive knowledge is simply not the only kind of physical knowledge to have. 

Certainly, but the logic would likely be fuzzy (T/F for any given aspect of affinity can be a value between 0 and 1). Certainly relationships can have a utility function. In terms of valuing two other people equally, there is no mathematical or philosophical reason one cannot, unless the sorting algorithm requires a clear hierarchy with no ties... 

Fun question! I suspect it is because our reality is subjective and we name the phenomenon for the way it appears to us. Because of relativity, from our perspective, the sun does set and it is the sun, not we, which is moving. This is not so inconsistent with what is actually going on, because the rising and setting of the sun is a function of the rotation of the earth in a roughly 24 hour cycle, as distinct from the the revolution of the earth around the sun. It's more that, from our perspective "the sun sets" below the horizon where we can no longer see it. As @SonOfThought astutely points out, using scientific language to accurately describe the phenomenon would be more expensive linguistically, less aesthetically pleasing, and unlikely to catch on. (Even scientists use "sunrise" and "sunset" as shorthand.;) 

Absolutely. I'd look to the framers of the US Constitution--the Bill of Rights supplants any religious doctrine in US society. Most modern democracies are likewise non-secular. The relationship of religion to ethics is likely a function of limited understanding of the natural world and primitive mathematics. (Without rational explanations for natural phenomena, one is left with only imagination to fill in the blanks, unless one takes a strictly rational, Socratic approach.) Once you have advanced mathematics, you can start analyzing issues such as economic and material disparity. Religion is partly used as a method of contextualizing suffering, which is often the result of disparity/disequilibrium. 

But Alexander you are right there, Plato and Socrates explicitly said Democracy was inherently flawed. Although they seemed to think it was due to an issue with the Greek institutions I am not using that assumption here as I don't think institutions are an axiom of democracy. [1] Note the Third Reich had no formal language, as it is not possible to define in an unambiguous non-contradictory way what Arian means, or what a Jew is; also there was no logical connection between Jews and Germany's problems, and a formal language requires formal logical connectors 

very interesting question. If you want to show that democracy is inherently flawed you first have to ask yourself what is inherently democracy. That is a pure logical issue. Your objective is to "axiomatise" democracy i.e. find what are its axioms. You mention the existence of an opposition. I am not so sure this is an axiom per se. For example as discussed above Greek democracy was a lottocracy which can be regarded as a random selection process among a pool of law-people. We can imagine how that process can be generalised to the whole population. Randomly selecting people who know enough about law does not seem incompatible to democracy and yet doesn't involve any opposition. Indeed as there is no election you don't have to be "competitive" or have a hidden agenda, you will necessarily act for your own opinion and NOT to win a (non-existent) election. Now that seems to mean that the existence of different opinions is not even an axiom either! Theoretically nothing prevents a democratic country where absolutely everyone would agree at a certain moment in time from existing. The least you can say is that a democracy has to tolerate freedom of expression. Indeed if you assume that random elections can be considered as democratic, then the only thing you have to assume is that diverging opinions (as long as they respect the other axioms of democracy) are allowed. They are not necessarily out there and explicit, but they could be. Otherwise there is no point in changing your ruler. Now what do you need to express a personal opinion (within the axioms of democracy)? This seems quite obvious. You need a language (a logorrhea in Greek) which everyone can understand and use to debate with you at the forum for example. This language can initially be quite vague and in case you need to cope with more technical questions or enact laws, you can turn to specialists or philosophers who would define unequivocally (scientifically) the terms you need to address your issue. So rather than a formal opposition you need a formal language. There is another axiom you cannot avoid. A democracy has to serve a purpose. Be it the greater good, freedom of the people, economic or political supremacy over other countries, maximum wealth, social equality... Throughout the world there is a great deal of purposes democracies try to achieve. In fact any system seems respect that axiom. Even the Third Reich served a purpose. Not only that, but the Third Reich served the same purpose as democracy: in that case it was to maintain the living standard of the German people (through Lebensraum) [1]. This seems quite obvious too: if there is no purpose, there is no project and therefore there is no choice. Now having a purpose and a formal language is equivalent to saying you want to maximise a certain objective function through a deterministic plan. In modern politics we would call that a program, i.e. a set of formal propositions. Why is it deterministic? Because everyone has to understand that plan in advance it is something which can be written down with plane words with no obvious contradiction. It strikes me for example that so many politicians nowadays say they have a plan to increase GDP growth or productivity. Was there such a plan, GDP growth would not be an issue: everyone would know what to do from inception, do it, and forget about it. We would see 100 percent or 200 percent growth everywhere around the world. And also, growth or productivity gains would never slow or go negative. Obviously in the real world they do, which proves that they cannot be completely captured by any deterministic plan. Anyway we have two axioms for democracy: a formal language which people can use to express their opinion. And a purpose. If you are happy with these axioms, i.e. if you think they would capture any democratic system in the world, you can start digging what can possibly go wrong with democracy inherently. Are you happy with that Alexander? If you are, I will post the second part of my comment which will address the heart of your question. PS: About Commando's answer 

something should presumably have to replace the question-mark against all logical possibility. And then even if something did replace it against all logical possibility, humans are at most right now merely demigods compared to dogs. Might this put a substantial hitch on some theoretical maximum of intelligence? Update 1 2014-10-17: While no one has pointed this out yet, during my discussions so far I realized that the frame of mind at around the time of generating this curiosity could readily concede to "The analogy breaks down if superintelligence (including up to hyperintelligence) necessarily must originate from at least as low as human-level intelligence." ... As a corollary, this doesn't bode well for traditional conceptions of God. Update 2 2014-10-17: Responder @ChrisSunami points out that a hunter-gatherer tribe 10 thousand years ago would not have a maximal ontology [in the relevant sense]. Since the main analogy broke down from Update 1, and in light of this hunter-gatherer point, a new analogy becomes forthcoming. 

A dog's ontology is presumably quite limited. A human's ontology is apparently maximal. While our average intelligence is quite a bit more than it is for dogs, it's not "godly" by comparison (maybe "demi-godly" but not godly, since for instance we can't create dogs from raw materials right now). But our ontology is maximal. If the analogy should carry over, as it seems it should, as in 

The propositions ~C, ~D, and ~A were not contradictions of any propositions that you derived. For example, up to those points, you had not derived C, D, or A. If you would have, you would have arrived at a contradiction sooner than when you arrived at B and ~B. For your first question, here's a much a simpler problem, and with words, so it's easier to get the idea.
