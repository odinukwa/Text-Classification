The administration was carried out by the Militair Gezag, literally the Military Authority. This authority was initially based in Brussels (Belgium), later in Breda and finally in The Hague. They had lower authority than the Supreme Allied Commander Allied Forces (General Dwight D. Eisenhower) leading the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF), Mission to the Netherlands. From Wikipedia: 

here, Randall Munroe refers to minute-by-minute — or even second-by-second — timelines / reconstructions that one can find in newspapers or on websites, such as Wikipedia. Have there been any big events that happened during DST changeover? By big event, I mean any event big enough such that it was covered with a detailed timeline (at least down to the minute) in major news media. 

The New Territories (新界) were leased to the British in 1898 as a huge extension to the original 1841 (Hong Kong) and following 1860 (Kowloon) leases. The British authorities immediately set out to plot the land and drew up the so called Block Crown Lease (and its associated Block Crown Lease Schedule representing how much annual rent was payable for each lot). To complete this survey of the new Territories, the British authorities used Indian surveyors. They produced cadastral plans (1899-1904) - first at the scale of 16 inches to the mile then at a larger scale of 32 inches to the mile. It is a well documented fact that Indian surveyors, engineers, medical practitioners and civil servants were dispatched all around the British Colonies not only in South Asia but also in Africa (Kenya, RSA...) to assist in the administration of Queen Victoria's Empire. So settlers, probably not. But surveyors surely. As to whether they were originally from Bengal and compared the Ping Yuan River to the Ganges is not said. Yet surveyors are also map makers and it is not too much of a stretch to imagine that they could have used a name they knew to shorten the local name "平原河". 

(If you ever get the chance to listen to Sergey Zimov speaking in person, I strongly recommend you do. His are most memorable lectures I've ever attended.) 

I recall hearing that in the past in Britain and Ireland, some workers (perhaps miners?) got their weekly wages paid out in the pub, much to the dismay of their wives. I don't remember where I heard or read it, and I can't find a reference to it now. Was there any era / branch / area where such was common practice? 

Yesterday I learned of the (somewhat obscure) Centrocaspian Dictatorship, an unrecognised state that existed for less than 2 months in 1918. Are there any other (less obscure) states that have called themselves a dictatorship? It seems more common dictatorships call themselves the free democratic people's worker's utopia and so on. 

Western Medieval Catholic kings and nobility in Britain, France, Spain and Portugal, Italy, Germany and Austria share certain distinctive common features that can be summed under the term of vassalage that are less present in Hungary and Poland, possibly also in Scandinavia. I am referring to the tradition of local autonomy of noble fiefs, integrated withing a pyramid of vassalage but very stable and distinct for hundreds of years. Many such fiefs operated as separate states or as states within states - not far from a federative structure, within which the power of kings was tempered by that of his nobles, and that of the great lords by the power of their vassals. In Poland and Hungary kingship was not hereditary, but elective. Why this difference? Is a Germanic versus a non-Germanic order at play here? What was the situation in Scandinavia? "Modern states" means in the Western part of Europe the dissolution of this system and the centralization of kingdoms ("absolutism"). But a different kind of absolutism was typical in Eastern Europe namely in the Orthodox Christian realm (Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia) were a system of Byzantine origin seems to have prevailed. In some cases nobles had no stable fiefs (wasn't this the case in Poland too?) and the King/Prince had absolute power on these (as well as on the nobility status). In some cases the leadership was not hereditary but the power was absolutist. Was this really a Byzantine (or even Roman) feature or is there a different origin at play? Other interesting aspects here may be the different roles played by religion - the presence and absence of Catholicism (in the differences between Catholic and Orthodox rulers and nobility) and the initial rivalry between the Pope and the (Western) Emperor (can that count in explaining the difference between Germany and the more centralized kingdoms?). 

In the Dutch General Election, 1948, the largest party was KVP with 32 seats. Second was PvdA with 27 seats. Normally the largest party provides the prime minister. Yet in the folowing KVP-PvdA-CHU-VVD coalition government, the prime minister was Drees (PvdA) rather than Van Schaik (KVP). Why did the second largest party rather than the largest party provide the prime minister between 1948 and 1951? 

As the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, incorporated conquered territories into Reichskommisariat Ostland, Reichskommissariat Ukraine, and military administration, they went on to implement the Holocaust and exterminate most of the Jews in Belarus, Lithuania, and elsewhere. Already during the Soviet invasion of Poland, many Jews reportedly welcomed the invading troops, apparently expecting to be better off under the Soviet Union than under Nazi Germany. Despite Stalinist oppression and antisemitism, Jews must have been less bad off under Stalin than under Hitler. In Western European countries, there was little time for Jews to flee to neutral or Allied countries; it took the Nazis only five days to occupy The Netherlands, for example; and the logistics of fleeing to the United Kingdom were complicated by the North Sea. But in the Soviet Union, it took the Nazis three months to take over the Baltic States, Belarus, and part of Ukraine. There would have been enough time to flee east. Why was there no massive wave of Jewish refugees, fleeing the advancing Nazi army by retreating deeper into the Soviet Union? Apparently, around 300,000 Polish Jews escaped to Soviet-occupied territories at the beginning of World War II. 

The history of the Etruscans composed by emperor Claudius (his first giant wife being of Etruscan origin). The Apocryphal Gospels. Think for instance that the mother of the discoverers of the Nag Hammadi library did actually burn the vast majority of the works that had survived for centuries... just to cook the household food... 

All these considerations were still applicable even after tribes had settled down (owing to the mastering of agriculture and metallurgy) because the geographical origin was until recently a reliable indication of your ethnicity. Us and them Overall it seems that the "us and them" way of seeing things was very common. I was recently reading this Wikipedia article about Samnium and there was an interesting conjecture, developed by Pokorny, about the relation between various Indo European tribe names: Suebi, Semnones, Suiones, Senones, Serbs, Sabelli, Sabini, etc., as well as a large number of kinship terms. The general concept is "our own kith and kin,". It also yields English self, German selbst, etc... Nations identified by commonalities In antiquity, City-states could be grouped in nations, mostly through their common language. Greek cities, despite their constant rivalries, had a strong conviction of their commonalities with each other (κοινή, κοινός = common) and of their differences with other nations mostly based on language (βάρβαρος who speak gobbledygook). Even Phoenicians or Etruscans who were could be considered as a mosaic of city states saw themselves as nations and had their own endonyms (Rasena/Rasna "the men", Kenaani/Kinaani "Canaanites"). Of course the differences between endonyms and exoyms sometimes blur the picture, but this is yet another fascinating topic. 

Trying to articulate an answer to the question: First, as I said, the question is not about "primitive" religion (where there are no states, powerful armies, etc), but about the religion of rather developed civilizations. Whether sacrifice is a "primitive" trend of religion may be a matter of speculation but, in the context of this question it may be considered so . This is confirmed by the answers that point out the relation between primitive agriculture and human sacrifices. In this sense, for the sake of this argument, human sacrifice will be considered "normal" at this "primitive" level, but problematic at a later date. The question, then, amounts to asking how come a such "primitive" aspect is present in some developed civilizations and is absent in others. It is noticeable that the disappearance of human sacrifice means less violent religions, but it doesn't mean less violent societies, on the contrary. Violence becomes the monopoly of far more powerful institutions than the strictly religious ones. These institutions are the political ones; they have a bigger control over intestine violence but are able to exercise a greater violence than ever before, either internally (as violent authority) or externally (as conquering kingdoms and empires). As for the answer, I think we have to consider the case of those civilizations where human sacrifice has disappeared. Why has it disappeared? As sacrificial violence tends to melt away into judicial violence, the development of powerful justice practices and institutions contributed to the full abandonment of human sacrifice. In the case of the Romans, Greeks and many other ancient civilizations, the sacrificial aspects of religion, especially human sacrifice, have greatly receded, and have become not only rare, but exceptional, or completely absent. Animal sacrifice has thus become the rule. An odd case is that of the Athenian pharmakos (French link is more detailed); it may have been rare, and the institution itself, without being exceptional, triggered the sacrificial event only in exceptional situations of crisis. The logic of such sacrifices is that when the "modern" institutions failed (in cases of military or natural disasters), the "old" mechanisms were used to help improve the situation. A somewhat different case is that of civilizations where human sacrifice was rare, but not exceptional, as it was done on regular basis at certain moments and places. That seems to be the case up to a point with the Carthaginians, Phoenicians, and other Middle East kingdoms and empires. Retainers sacrifices have been regular up to a certain date in Egypt and China. India's economic, political and religious diversity amounts to a more complex case, because "primitive" human sacrifice (in certain isolated agricultural communities), and other regular sacrifices like that of wifes of deceased or those to Sakti are documented until much recent dates. A special case is that of the Amerindian empires, and especially of the Aztecs. It seems that in this case the religious institutions related to human sacrifice have not only been kept with the strengthening of the political institutions, but have been further developed and strengthened. What arguably happened was a sort of innovation where sacrificial religion and politics became unified under a single imperialistic ideology, by which the development of the empire stimulated sacrificial religious practices and these practices stimulated the imperial development (as it imposed a constant need for new captives to be sacrificed). An aspect that is not mentioned in the question is the relation between human sacrifice and canibalism. Canibalism may possibly be the most "primitive" aspect of this "primitive" phenomenon, but this qualification may be controversial. What is not controversial is the fact that Aztecs were also practicing canibalism. This may have been encouraged by the originality of the Aztec religious ideology and by other cultural trends relating to the ecological or biological background. (These ecological reasons are also controversial, but on the importance of biological and climatic circumstances one can find interesting Jared Diamond's book Guns, Germs, and Steel.) 

The Allied Liberation of The Netherlands lasted from 12 September 1944 (when the first villages were liberated) to 5 May 1945, when the German capitulation took force (not counting a few German remnants on some islands). However, the Dutch government-in-exile did not return until the war was over. How was the administration of the liberated part organised? Was it under allied military administration? Did parts of the Dutch government return to be in charge? Did the Dutch government govern remotely? 

According to Russian scientist Sergey Zimov, the disappearance of grasslands in Siberia was not due to Climate Change, but due to overhunting in prehistoric times. The theory is that humans killed the large grazers. This led to the older steppe-like landscape to be replaced by the less productive and less biodiverse dense forests that we associate with Siberia today. Those forests are so much darker than the previous landscape, that it has a significant impact on global average temperature. According to this theory, not only did pre-industrial civilisations engage in unsustainable practices, but they actually engaged in anthropogenic climate change. Note that there is currently no scientific consensus on this theory, but I find it a very intriguing thought. 

The post is already too long, but I fear the OP (given the comments made) may not find it clarifying enough (or interesting enough to read). I fear such clarifying discussions tend indeed to become very complex (but there is no point in being apologetic about that, as I think rational tension is the only alternative to the irrational one). On the other hand, I need to prevent further misunderstanding on the point of personal sympathy or inclination towards one theory or the other (and I do not wish post or comment any more) by underlying that: 

When I first asked this question I was anticipating a quick answer, but it seems that is problematic. I will try to answer it myself and then progressively improve the answer based on comments and such. 

This is not a complete answer because your question is actually a huge topic with many possible approaches. Birth is ethnicity My personal view on this is that, long ago, at a time when the nomadic way of life was the rule, nations did not relate to geographical origin but rather to birth. The etymology of various IE languages is very clear on this: 

And there are many more. We would love to have the detailed account of Pytheas' exploration of Ancient Britain for example. Wikipedia has a catalogue mainly applicable to western culture which will give you an overview ordered by famous authors. 

There are so many lost works that it is probably impossible to establish a comprehensive catalogue. Not to mention of course those works we will never know they even existed. Even in recent times the burning of libraries can wipe out invaluable manuscripts (e.g. Jaffna library). Two examples which immediately come to mind: 

Most if not all of the present Muslim countries & regions close to Europe (or in Europe, e.g. parts of Spain and of the Balkans) in North Africa and the Middle East became Muslim as a result or in relation with their territories being first conquered by a Muslim military force, namely the Arabs and the Ottoman Turks. But there must be exceptions to this "rule" (variations from this trend). I think Indonesia is one (now the most populous Muslim country). Are there other exceptions in that region or in others? What about sub-Saharan Africa? 

If the question is about the historical figures and events, then one would have to look at the history of the first kingdoms (Egypt, Mesopotamia, China). If it is about the origin of the institution, the answer can only be a matter of speculation because the origin of monarchy (as of other institutions) go far back to prehistorical times. A solution might be to renounce a chronological perspective in favor of a structural or genealogical one. The idea would be then to consider the oldest forms of monarchy that anthropologists and ethnographers have identified. The "primitive" kings were religious figures just like the very recent ones, only even more so, given that "politics" were not yet there. The king was probably initially a sacred/sacrificial figure. That is, he was not only sacred, but also an object of a sacred action, a victim of sacrifice, and was put to death in a religious ritual. There are a lot of relics of this phenomena, some already analyzed in the 19th century by James Frazer in The Golden Bough (1890). A more recent interpretation is that of Rene Girard, who in Violece and the Sacred (1972) further develops this perspective in more general terms.
