Average annual number of mountain lion attacks on humans per one million residents in the western U.S. and British Columbia, 1972-2005 

It seems altitude does not stop one from using a solar cooker as long as there is sunshine. The Solar Trekkers Cooker fits in a backpack and has been used at base camp on Mt Everest. This link has a video of Allart Ligtenberg cooking on Everest! 

All said and done Mummut says you should not washing powders or fabric softeners. It seems to me you could try this product: Nathan Sport-Wash. Before using any new product on clothes please read the particular labels to see if the ingredients of this detergent are safe to use. If in doubt, one could email the manufacturer at Mammut. 

Many years ago, while hiking with a friend, we came across a particular point in the trail which was rather dangerous. If one slipped, the fall would surely be fatal. What struck me most is the fact that there was a sign in/sign out sheets (which were in a green box with a plexiglass lid) at the beginning and end of this particular section of the trail. One was encouraged to print one's name, the date and time. The reason for the signing in and out was to know for a fact that hikers actually made it to the other end. If one did not sign in on the other side, Search and Rescue had a idea of where to look. These sign in/sign out sheets were in mid trail and there were no sign in sign in sheets at the trailhead and no permits were required either. My question is this: Are Sign in/Sign out sheets for dangerous passages while hiking a common practice? Are there any laws requiring this? 

That said it would be in your own interest not to pitch a tent to close to a boar's lair, where there may be young being sheltered. Also avoid camping on or near trails that boars are known to travel on. Boars do not listen to rules of thumb, so be prudent. 

Military History Journal What I find great about the solo style I use is that the parts I employ are that they are light, as well as adjustable and thus I am able to go on different size tracks and tracks of different widths between the tracks. For example some abandoned mines use different gauges and widths. Just do not go into a mine for safety reasons. 

I know that this question has several good responses, but I would like to put forth my two bits worth. I would like to include the use of a boomerang as a non-gun hunting instrument or tool and has been historically used for hunting, as well as a sport, and entertainment, especially in the land down under. They can be used on both small and large game alike. 

It seems that that there is at least one company that has wheelchair accessibility for railbike riding. It is in Belgium as can be seen here. 

More information on tomahawk throwing can be found here. For those who prefer learning through a video, this YouTube video may fit the bill: How to Throw a Tomahawk | The Art of Manliness. 

In order to understand the question of rabies and whether or not an animal is rabid, a little background information is necessary. 

You can get more information from them here, If you desire a different style of railbike, they should be able to point you in the right direction. Here is an historical look at South Africa's military using railbikes during the ANGLO-BOER WAR OF 1899-1902: 

Since deterrents sometimes fail, Polar Guards must be trained to bring down a polar bear if necessity requires it and it would seem to make sense that they must employ the prescribed requirements for ammunition and firearms as for hunting these bears.

Seam Grip Field Repair Kit If I were to make my own repair kit I would add a few more items to make it a little bit more usable on other things.

Or you could be like me. I use a blue light on my porch simply because I do not want a lot of white light coming in through the window! 

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has a series of protocols in place for this subject. Protocols for Safe Handling and Disposal of Carcasses: 

If in a survival situation, how can one preserve the hide of an animal with a minimum amount of tools and skill in order to make clothing or bedding? I am not asking how to make things with the hides. I simply would like to know the most primitive way to preserve the skin of an animal for survival reasons. 

We had this same problem with our family tent (6 person tent) while camping in the interior of British Columbia. And it gets hot there. First of all, color maybe beneficial for you. Try choosing a tent of a light color such as off white or cream. Light colored fabrics tend not to get as hot as dark colored ones. If a tent has flap window with the ability of being tied open (which ours did) on the sides where there is no door this would be helpful in letting the air circulate in and out of the tent. However if your tent has these features, but has a sort of screen sown into it in order to keep the bugs out, then the open windows are really of no avail. And if possible keep the door open as well. Other than this I would suggest tenting in the shade if possible or making some shade with a tarp to keep the sun off the tent. 

I would use krazy glue as long as the shoe is clean. Do not cut the loose thread, but using a needle hide the thread between some fabric. Put the crazy glue along the entire section of stitching in order to reinforce the stitching itself. This should work as I have done this on outside chairs and no one knows that I repaired them. All said and done the best thing to do is restitch the shoe by hand using the same holes of the manufacturer and then glue it on both sides of the stitch (top and bottom). Gorilla Glue might work but being a waterproof glue is not the same as being breathable such as your Goretex fabric in the shoe. It will form a barrier between the shoe and the rain or water. At least with the kazy glue it is possible to spot glue your shoe. 

When I hunt for large game, I go with some buddies of mine and we split up while hunting. We only take one kill at a time and everyone helps in the field dressing and quartering. The meat is divided up evenly. It is a lot of weight to carry out of the bush by yourself. 

I do not believe space heaters would be a good idea in a tent. There is not a large volume of air mass to heat in a tent and if you are asleep in a tent, how can you maintain that your feet (for example) would not get too close to the heater for safety reasons and start a fire. Besides sleeping bags do quite well to keep people warm, while camping in a tent. Never have a fire inside your tent as that is simply asking for something to go terribly wrong. 

Is whiskey a good disinfectant in an emergency situation while in the outdoors? Ideally any strong alcohol, whether whiskey, vodka, tequila or some other strong liquor should not be used to clean wounds. But in an a survival situation, I would not hesitate to use whiskey or some other strong liquor such as vodka on a wound while in the great outdoors. 

A Polar Bear Guard Training Course Offered in Iqaluit through the Nunavut Artic College, but I do not know how often the course is available. 

Animal scat is used in the identification and tracking of wild animals. Animal Scat has a number of animal scat photos that could be helpful in animal research. 

What part of the world has the most varieties of corals in a concentrated area? Of coarse this question can only be qualified by an accurate definition of what the OP means by a concentrated area. In any case I am going to put in my two bits worth. 

There is probably no perfect answer to your question as different studies will indicate some amount of variation. However it seems that black bear cubs which are usually born in January and generally stay with their mothers for about 17 months are self-sufficient at the age of 5 or 6 months. Under some circumstances mothers with cubs will accept strange cubs in their dens. Cubs will instinctively make dens in the fall. The following is taken from the USDA in Minnesota: AIDING THE WILD SURVIVAL OF ORPHANED BEAR CUBS. 

Many manufacturers of inflatable sleeping pads sell repair kits. Duct tape could be used in an emergency, but I would only use it as a last resort as it will leave a residue on your sleeping pad when you get back home and want to repair it properly. Most kits will have something like the following items in them: 

Had a neighbor who used this technique to get worms all the time. It was amazing how well this system really works. He used a system where he had several car batteries rigged onto a dolly and thus was able to get his worms away from any buildings. He always caught his worms at night with a flashlight in hand. After putting the two metal rods into the ground, one simply had to wait a few minutes for the worms to come to the surface. I cannot recall any of us ever getting electrocuted doing this with him, but was it ever a time saver. One draw back to this method is that the worms seemed to have a shorter life expectancy (I cannot recall how long they generally lived for, perhaps a week or so). Here is how others do it:
